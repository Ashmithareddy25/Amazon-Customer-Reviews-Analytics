How universes came into existence with out the need of a creator or gods how ever you want to phrase the term.

0061914177|4.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a colleague that I respect. After reading the book from cover-to-cover in  maybe 4 hours, it became obvious to me that he shares the same enthusiasm for social networking as the book's author, Gary Vaynerchuk. That's really the key to being able to leverage the information in the book, and appreciate its true message; which is that you can captialize (i.e. \\"crush\\") on a plethora of free marketing, promotional, and branding opportunities, courtesy of the web, if you properly - and consistently - use them as tools to build success. Think of it as a starting point; not a finish line. Good luck crushin it.<br /><br />preciating this book, and it's also the key
0374158460|5.0|This is the first I have read of this author and I will read more of his books. Not only are the characters almost real you start to feel for them and can't wait to read what happens next. A blend of politics and cultural modernism with a very personal insiders look at the people. With profound insight of what a almost real story in today's society can and probably does happen within political inner deals and bartering with in war and voting strategy. This book is a hit through and through read it and you will get addicted to the characters and the excellent writing.

Prepare for raw situations, startling revenge, and uncharacteristic responses.  It may take a few pages to pull you in but the ride is worth it.
B001S86J5S|5.0|I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters. I was 13. Somehow I convinced my parents to take me to go see it. At that time I mainly enjoyed the story-line, some no name, washed up baseball players join together and win when no one else - especially the team owner - don't believe they can (or in the case of the team owner, want them to). I saw the movie again when I was older and not only still enjoyed the story-line, but realized all the humor sprinkled within. Now my best friend and I will quote all the great scenes, and there are plenty of them.<br /><br />This movie is a must for anyone looking for a funny, feel good story. I feel there is a reality to it with the foul language all the players use. Granted there are more than a few scenes that you can tell the people in the movie are actors and not baseball players. Of course, being a huge baseball fan I tend to notice this more than non-hardcore baseball fans.<br /><br />The picture quality is great on my flat screen and the special features are great.<br /><br />Don't hesitate.....get this movie today...you'll love it!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|There are times when an actor gets to a play a role he was born to play. Such is the case with George C. Scott, who plays the iconic general. The film chronicles Patton's war years, as he was a man solely built for war, and does it rather well. Scott captures Patton perfectly. I remember watching this on television with my family and my aunt and uncle's family. Afterward my uncle commented that Scott so captured Patton that at one point he was going to go through the screen and say \\"Goddammit, Cobleigh, go and put on a decent uniform, you slacker. And don't let me catch you like that again!\\" Patton has only two major flaws: One, General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden in a great performance) is seen as Patton's friend. In reality he hated George. Patton was a far better general and informed Bradley that he thought Hitler would attack through the Ardennes, as her had in 1940. Bradley pooh-poohed it, and we all know what happened. Then it was left up to Patton to pull Bradley's cookies out of the fire. The other miscue in the film concerns the equipment. Patton is using M-24 Chaffee light tanks (introduced in 1944, but not really widely used in battle until the Korean War) and the Germans are using M47 and 48 tanks (nicknamed \\"Pattons\\", ironically). If a movie such as Kelly's Heroes, made the same year, can feature Shermans, why couldn't this high-budget, \\"important\\" picture? The Sherman was the prominent American tank of the war. As for the German tanks, I can understand not featuring Tigers (there is only one surviving Tiger), but they could have used Stugs, or Mark IVs. In fact, most of the Afrika Corps' armor consisted of Mark IVs. Other than that, it's a great movie. Michael Bates is wonderful as General Montgomery, and is the spitting image of him, even down to the voice. Monty and Patton, being both egomaniacs, were naturally in competition, but both agreed on one thing: they didn't like Ike. After one order Patton received from Ike, his disgust was written on his face, to which Montgomery replied. \\"George, if you get an order you don't like, why don't you simply do what I do? Ignore it.\\" But by no means ignore this movie.ce, to which Montgomery replied. \\"George, if you get an order you don't like, why don't you simply do what I do? Ignore it.\\" But by no means ignore this movie.
0439023513|4.0|I don't see the point of pre ordering a book online when you don't get it the day it comes out in stores. It was just as cheap to buy the book at target and I wouldn't have had to wait to get it in the mail. I will not be buying new release books online anymore, it is really inconvenient when people start telling you the ending before you have the chance to read the book because you are waiting on the mail.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|The only reason I don't give this film a 5 is I could have done without the in-your-face graphic violence.  But it's Tarrantino, so it's to be expected.  The direction on this is fabulous, the acting, the story, the pacing, the cinematic appeal...  It's really an interesting perspective, retelling a Nazi-era drama, though as one should expect, the underlying details are gritty, ugly, and sometimes gross.  The convergence of subplots into the primary story is well done and exciting.  If you're OK with Tarrantino's needful spin of fetish-cum-violence, this film will not disappoint, and may leave you thinking about how war criminals are really treated in our culture.

B003V6L94Q|4.0|If you liked the first album you will like this one as well!  Sometimes artists have a terrific opening album and not so hot follow-up. ZBB delivered a solid second album is enjoyable start to finish. It's not \\"all country\\" but a nice mix of country with some other styles mixed in (with a bit of country twist).  Unfortunately, some of the songs will get \\"bleeped\\" or re-mixed to cover up some words when aired on the radio (if you know the \\"Toes\\" song from the album you sadly know what I mean).    Buy it and enjoy it. I certainly am glad I did.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|What a great final season for \\"Lost\\".  It is fantastic that they got to wrap up the series and give the viewer an opportunity to unravel many of the mysteries that have puzzled us since the first season.  I was tremendously disappointed when \\"The Dead Zone\\" was abruptly cancelled, leaving so much hanging.  As with the previous season DVD packages, the bonus material in the final season package are top notch.  If you liked \\"Lost\\", this is a must buy.
0143117130|3.0|This is a fun read for those who are big fans of the BJ movies.  If I had not seen the movies, I am not so sure I would have enjoyed the book. The storyline is told mostly via a diary format.  Yet, even the diary entries are hilarious and are cleverly written.  The story does vary somewhat from the first movie although as you are reading you realize where they pulled certain scenes out of the book specifically for the movie. There are certain parts of the diary where Bridget just talks about what was said instead of the reader actually experiencing the conversation themselves which was somewhat disappointing. It also focused quite a bit on her relationship with Daniel (or lack thereof) for at least three quarters of the book and much less on developing the relationship with Mark Darcy.  The end was quite abrupt and although not suprising I felt it could have been drawn out a bit in order to build some anticipation.  Overall, entertaining read and because its written in the diary format its easy to put down and pick back up when you are ready for more diary readings!
0618871713|5.0|Alison Bechdel, like her father Bruce before her, pays incredible attention to getting all the details right. Just as he carefully reworked their family house (that served also as a funeral home), so she has gone over the house and its history with her family compulsively, lovingly, laboriously, in an attempt to uncover the truth of her childhood and adolescence. The details are what put the \\"fun\\" as it were, into FUN HOME: though Bechdel and her brothers believe their childhood with their explosive father and distant mother were traumatic and use the name to describe their homestead in jest, it's clear also that she has an enormous amount of respect and even affection for her past, and the book attempts to re-produce it while always aware of the gaps, fragments, and inconsistencies of such re-creation.<br /><br />The Bechdels are a family obsessed with their own creativities, and they seem to see the consumption of books as active and as creative as the writing of them: part of Alison Bechdel's work in this text is to read the world around her carefully (and reading was where she and her book-loving father found their greatest moments of closeness). The reproduction of details in this encyclopedic narrative are remarkable, as is Bechdel's willingness to read them unflinchingly, even when they show her family and her past self at their most frail and self-interested. Already, in just a few years, this work has emerged as a kind of classic of the genre, and it fully deserves its high reputation.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|This film was really fun.  The dialogue was great, largely born of the great chemistry between Law and Downey.  The plot was a bit predictable, but it had a wonderful layering of clues and red herrings throughout, engaging the audience in the story.  The cinematography was impressive, as were the costumes and sets.  I particularly liked how Holmes wasn't presented as the perfect Victorian man or genius scholar; rather, he presented lots of personality flaws and goofy moments. I admit, most of the great action sequences were in the trailer, but it was still an all around great film, definitely worth seeing.
4770030088|4.0|Japanese for Busy People I: Romanized Version is a good starting point for beginners. This was a required textbook for an Introduction to Japanese Course I took and I found it's lessons very helpful. The CD included is a great way to listen to the language and test one's comprehension skills. The one drawback is the romanization. I did not know it at the time of purchase, but new students are better off purchasing the Kana version as soon as they learn Hiragana and Katakana.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I'm loving this album.  After reading all the enthusiastic reviews here I was skeptical, I haven't been much of an A7 fan in recent years.  But maybe some of these reviewers are right, this is their best album ever.

B0031R5K68|1.0|If you've read either The DaVinci Code or Angels & Demons don't bother with The Lost Symbol. In fact, even if you haven't read either of Dan Brown's previous works don't bother with this book. Written as though he needed to pad out the book I found it to be predictable and rather boring.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|Just saw the DVD,now Ridley finally got the story completed!!(especially the relationship between Marion/Robin and Marion/Wild children)It became more logical and real...has more emotions on the storyboard.Overall it's much better than theatrical version...I was wondering why Universal could not release the director's cut at the first place?Maybe the boxoffice will be higher than 300 millions!!Pity.
B002RWKSII|3.0|The spate of older pop artists covering the Great American Songbook grows everyday.  This effort with the Beach Boy sound and the Gershwin melodies is a nice addition to this library.  I do not find myself adding this to my all time favorites list, but it is pleasant and a little surprising to listen to.  It lacks the vitality it should have, but it provides a smooth rendition of old favorites.
0439023513|5.0|...for many reasons. I definitely thought this was the most heart-wrenching of the books. I think we saw some of Katniss' inner flaws and I felt it made her more real and even more likeable. And, it didn't end with an easy happily-ever-after. I think we're so used to seeing those endings that we're caught off-guard and even disappointed when it doesn't end perfectly, giving readers perfect closure. I was not 100% happy with the ending, because honestly, it was not a 100% happy ending for anyone. However, it did not disappoint. I loved all three of the books and am sad to have the story end at all...which to me, is the hallmark of a good book.
B001AR0D4A|1.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it first came out...and I had a hard time not walking out in the middle of it.  For years I have endured Mr. King's seemingly obligatory snipes at Christians; but it seems that here he gives full vent to his bigotry, and as a result produced a thing far beneath its potential for the sake of his malicious rant.    I own many of Mr. King's works, and was able to enjoy them despite the ever-present wacky Christian character each one has; but Mr. King seems to have gotten so lost in  his anti-Christian scripting that the rest of the story got lost.    Wake-up Mr. King, the world needs more story-tellers and fewer bigots. You've got the talent, now just stop abusing it.
B0000029LG|5.0|Love, love, love this album!  Michael is raw, edgy, and angry (came out after Chandler extortion scandal).  The first disc is many of the greats we all know; the second has Moscow, Scream, Earth Song, TDCAU, Money (a personal favorite) and so many songs that became Michael classics -- killer songs -- though I still can't listen to Smile.  Editorial reviewer Steve Mirkin (wrote 1995 review) needs to go work for the Food Channel and leave music commentary to someone else!
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I'll be very quick and short reviewing this album. I really cannot believe the negative response this album is getting so far. I'm in love with it. I love every song and intro. When bands decide to do something new, this is what it should sound like. It's nothing like Linkin Park that I knew before, there are still some pretty familiar electronic beats, but overall it's refreshing and completely surprising.<br /><br />People who disliked the \\"Minutes To Midnight\\" album will probably hate this one too, this is definitely not what you'd expect from your favorite band, so just skip it for sure!<br /><br />For all the other fans out there who like versatile and creative musicians, this is a real treat!<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars!
0316098337|5.0|Wow, the most . . . unforgettable book that I've read in a long time . . . [i]ROOM[/i] by Emma Donoghue.  I picked it up from the 7 day shelf at work on Friday afternoon and could not put it down.  (and for a librarian who literally picks up books by the hundreds, daily, that's saying something.) Riveting, intense, told entirely from the entirely believable point of view of a five year old, definitely worth a read if you haven't yet.  I find myself still thinking about it two days later.

B00005NTJK|5.0|...if you are wondering who [facepalm] Jethro Tull is.  Not to mention why so many are upset that Tull isn't in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (and it's not until they are).    I did have a question which I bet is asked and maybe answered elsewhere (wish I had time to read all the reviews right now).  In my original vinyl edition, which I don't exactly have with me, \\"Teacher\\" is an integral part of the album.  (I believe it follows \\"A time for everything.\\")  What happened to it that it had to be added back in?  At least they got it back on here.  And \\"Witch's Promise,\\" which regardless of when it was recorded doesn't quite sound like it belongs here, enriches any Tull experience, so I'm glad it's here just for that.    To my mind, this record along with \\"Aqualung,\\" \\"Living in the Past,\\" Tull's first two albums and \\"Minstrel in the Gallery,\\" makes the case for Tull as a Rock Hall of Fame act.  And I haven't close to exhausted the good stuff with that list.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Well, if you liked Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut, The Shining, and Alan Parker's Angel Heart... you will like this. It's beautifully crafted, so much care to details, eerie, disturbing, psychologically intriguing... it's what Inception was trying to be, I think actually Leo took his character straight from Shutter Island and into Inception... if you want it to be more like Silence of the Lambs, well it's not and you'll be disappointed... Scorsese is the last of his generation to still be making high caliber films, this is of highest caliber, it really is.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|The closest to Dirty Harry 6 we'll get...    Consider Walt the 21st century version of the 20th century Harry Callahan. Or, if you prefer, think of Walt as Harry's first cousin. (Harry took care of business on the west coast, Walt took care of the east.)    Excellent film. It should've got Clint an acting Oscar, just as he should've got one for the original Dirty Harry.     If this really was his last role as an actor, it was the perfect one.

B001MEJY8W|1.0|This is not actually a film. A film is supposed to be a story.      What this is, is a flimsy and poorly contrived pretext to show graphic torture. It's a snuff film. There is no redeeming feature whatsoever, no merit, nothing to be gained. As a horror afficionado who doesn't mind being shocked, I have a very liberal idea when it comes to censorship... but this filth should be banned, unless you believe snuff movies should be available for purchase.      Someone who wishes to be an artist but has no soul cannot create beauty. All they can create is something that shocks people with souls, or scratches the itch of sadists. Hence this \\"movie\\".       I advise you to avoid anyone who claims to have enjoyed this \\"movie\\". Such a person has a spiritual sickness beyond human power to cure. To such folk, I wish you all the best and hope you find the healing you need.
044654759X|5.0|I have read each and every book that Nicholas Sparks has written and had published and between Safe Haven and The Guardian, I would have to say that I love them both the most. Safe Haven was written in such a way that I couldn't put the book down. I picked this book up 2 days ago only to finish it just a few moments ago (in between working all 3 of these days and taking care of 3 kids as well). The suspense and the friendships that are formed in this novel have left me with a feeling of fulfillment after the finishing of it.   I highly recommend reading this book, but I will go no further, so that I don't ruin it for anyone else!!!! Read up, you will definitely not be disappointed!
0316113506|5.0|Though \\"undiagnosed\\" I am certain that I am an adult sufferer of ADD (I have no hyperactivity symptoms, and so refute the lumping together of ADD and ADHD in the latter catagory).  However, I refuse to accept that this means that I am \\"broken\\" or dysfunctional. (see [[ASIN:1887424148 Attention Deficit Disorder : A Different Perception]])  I was made this way for a reason.  I have \\"tendencies\\", as we all do, and a lack of structure, strategy, and control have lead to a lot of bad habits.  To me this book confirms what I have always suspected, that I am simply not operating and maintaining my machinery (body & brain) correctly for its intended function.  This book shows how to do that and presents compelling evidence that the answer is not ultimately a pill, but rather the hard work necessary to bring mind and body into proper alignment. Highly recommended, but only if you are serious about getting better.
0545310601|4.0|When THE HUNGER GAMES was published two years ago, I initially started listening to the book on CD. After a few hours of that, though, I found myself at my local children's bookstore, buying a print copy instead. It turns out that the audiobook narration, although adept and exciting, just couldn't keep up with how fast I wanted to ingest Suzanne Collins's harrowing story. Caught up in the action, I wanted to find out what happened next at a pace faster than the narrator could read aloud. So, like countless other fans, I devoured the rest of the book at breakneck pace, did the same with its sequel, CATCHING FIRE, when it released last year, and spent the last several months eagerly awaiting the final installment of the series.    Well, MOCKINGJAY is here, and a satisfactory conclusion it is indeed. Although it lacks the sort of concentrated, stage-managed drama necessitated by the \\"games\\" structuring the THE HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE, the freer form of the storytelling matches the increased complexity of Collins's plot and themes. She doesn't spend a lot of time getting readers up to speed (note: if you haven't read the first two novels in the trilogy yet, do yourself a huge favor and do that first), instead dropping right in on a Katniss who is confused, weakened and disoriented following the devastation at the close of CATCHING FIRE. She's unsure who to trust, deeply ambivalent about her own role in the mounting rebellion against the Capitol, and distraught in the wake of so much loss.    Eventually, however, Katniss agrees to fulfill the role the leaders of the rebellion intended for her --- to become the Mockingjay, the public face of the rebellion. In interviews, promotional videos and skirmishes that are (of course) televised throughout the districts, Katniss is an inspiration to millions, a fact that she only fully understands when she ventures into other deeply damaged but still hopeful and fighting districts: \\"I begin to fully understand the lengths towhich people have gone to protect me,\\" Katniss comments.    \\"What I mean to the rebels. My ongoing struggle against the Capitol, which has so often felt like a solitary journey, has not been undertaken alone. I have had thousands upon thousands of people from the districts at my side. I was their Mockingjay long before I accepted the role.\\"    Meanwhile, however, Katniss's Hunger Games partner and love interest, Peeta, is being held captive, publicly turned against Katniss and the other rebels, shattering Katniss's trust and forcing her to question everything she thought she knew. And as Katniss and her friends and fellow Hunger Games Victors are sent into dangerous, highly orchestrated missions, she begins to wonder whether the ends justify the means and even, finally, whether it's possible to have \\"ends\\" at all.    Collins's countless fans will be eager not only to see how she addresses the complicated political situations she has set up in the first two novels, but also to learn whether and how Katniss resolves the conflicts being waged in her heart, as she struggles to love either Gale or Peeta, both of whom --- like everyone in Katniss's world --- are damaged in their own ways. At first, it looks like Collins might take the easy way out, using external forces to make Katniss's decision for her; rest assured, though, that Katniss must eventually find her own way here as elsewhere.    Although the suspense in MOCKINGJAY is perhaps of a less obvious variety, it is no less palpable than in the previous trilogy installments. Palpable, too, is the anti-war sentiment, stronger here even than in Collins's earlier novels. But amid staggering losses, impossibly high stakes, and indelible scars both visible and invisible, hope, fragile and rare like the mockingjay's song, still abides.       --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl
B003Y2XI8W|5.0|I am so surprised there are only 25 reviews of this album as of this one. Amazing to think such a great album can get away with being so obscure. Sweet Disposition was the highlight song from 500 Days of Summer in my opinion, and really deserved to shoot this band into the limelight. I think they're getting there quick too! The album has a stellar old school vocal vibe coupled with great alternative licks that mesh together into a genre worthy of calling new. Highly recommended album.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|\\"Blood of the Nations\\" is by far the best Accept disc since \\"Balls to the Wall\\". The new singer is great. In the same vein as Udo, but pleasently different. I believe he could do their back catalog without missing a beat. Wolf Hoffman truely is the best heavy guitarist out of Germany. Monster riffs abound. Classic runs bring former Accept songs to mind. Awesome bass grooves provided by Peter Baltes, who is highly underrated. Great gang vocals. This should cement Accept as the only teutonic band with balls still whoopin' ass. I can't wait to see them live. I saw 'em in '84,'85,'86 with Udo.  l'm really looking forward to seeing them with Mark. Get ready America! Something wicked is comin' our way. Hi Di Hi Do Hi Da indeed.
630469654X|5.0|Great movie for those who want the plot to carry the story, this movie satisfies both the \\"chick flick\\" genre and the adventure/fantasy genre.  The setting is Midieval France in which the 4 main charactors, the evil bishop which must be overcome, the unassuming thief unwittingly drawn into the drama, and the two lovers suffering from the tormenting enchantment which keeps them separated, do battle for the final outcome.  This movie is noteably without a lot of gratuitous sex or language issues, and while it has some violence in the form of sword fights, it is by no means graphic.  I would be comfortable letting school-aged children watch this movie, and it is a refreshing change from the standard fare at the movies or on tv.  Get the popcorn and the treats, sit back and prepare to be entertained with this compelling adventure from long ago :)
B000K4WPCC|5.0|This movie is so much fun to watch. The guys are hot and the plot is interesting. It's not too long and the music is adds energy. I watch it over and over again!

0061914177|4.0|Big fan of Gary V, and have been for some time now. I felt his book was great, and innovative but a bit redundant. His passion is extremely infectious, which one reason I think everyone should have some form of Gary V in their life. If anything, start with his lectures and his podcasts, his completely transparent approach to everything really shines in everything he does.<br /><br />[...]<br />[...]<br />You won't be disappointed, you'll learn a lot, and more than anything infectious passion is never a bad thing. I'm also really looking forward to his second book The Thank You Economy, [[ASIN:0061914185 The Thank You Economy]]
0307454541|4.0|Since hundreds of people have reviewed this book, I feel no need to describe the storyline here.  Either you already have heard about it or you've read a few other reviews and you know darned well what kind of plot to expect and probably have an inkling of the types of characters who populate this novel.  Of course, there is also a certain amount of intrigue involving the deceased author, which for some folks might make for more interest in getting their hands on this novel.  Frankly, I'd rather just tell you what I thought of it.  To begin with, after I got this onto my kindle, I found it a real page-turner.  It is well plotted, with reasonably fast-paced plotting and a fair amount of action that moves the story forward (considering, of course, that this is NOT the literary equivalent of a shoot-em-up or film containing an endless series of car chase sequences).  The characters are well drawn and enough of them are likeable enough that we are interested in what happens to them.  Yes, there is also a bit of a mystery here that our protagonists work hard to solve, and it is here that I must admit if a criticism must be made, it is in the familiar conventions of such a genre novel that one reaches the end of the tale feeling there was nothing new here.  Not a serious flaw, however, as the story certainly does its job of entertaining, even if not enlightening, us.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|Worth watching, good acting, and a nice twist...many of the great people and events of history were influenced by chance and how they reacted is what made them the heroes or the duds that we know today.  No one knows for sure how or if these things went down and this is a nice version.  At least some form of the idea of freedom was rattling around at that time, for the gentry anyway, ala the Magna Carta, so the \\"freedom contract\\" isn't that far fetched in this movie.  Give it a try.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I love my Twilight movie soundtrack.  It has full versions of all the songs featured in the movie, all right, and it does have Bella's Lullaby - the reason I ordered the CD.  But there is no other music from the film - like the wonderful instrumentals composed for it, that set the mood and add so much dimension to the action on the screen.  I think this is a serious deficiency in the album, so I gave it only 3 stars.  I like what is there; it's just not enough.    Sue Daniels
B0025KVLRY|4.0|This album has been on my radar since I saw a documentary many years ago about The Beatles' one and only tour of Australia (which cost the promoters peanuts...they were signed to tour here just before they became the biggest band in the world). That documentary featured a song I had never heard before but became an instant early Beatles' classic for me...\\"It won't be long\\". The fact that I found out some years ago that Nirvana's Kurt Cobain lists this album (or the US variant of it) in his top 50 records of all time just made acquiring this album even more do-able. Can't say I am taken with this album as much as Kurt was (though the US version does include two orphan singles of the band which wasn't on the UK release). The main reason I'm giving this album 77.5/100 is because that early 1950s American rock'n'roll influence doesn't appeal that much to me. I prefer their original contributions to contemporary pop/rock...though I think that they do have the definitive version of \\"Twist and shout\\", which does not appear on this album. This is a review of the remastered cd which came out in 2009, with a digipak format (which I'm not that keen on). Total running time is 33:06. If my cd has content for computers, I haven't looked at that.  Tracks reviewed...      The best tracks (\\"/\\"):      It won't be long - has the faux stereo typical of this era (where song elements would be on one speaker or another...it doesn't sound realistic). The lead guitar and the drums are on the left hand side speaker and the vocals are on the right hand side speaker. In any case the sound is dry and crisp, which is a plus. Can't say how the sound compares to early cd releases of this album...presumably it's superior. A high energy song with John on lead vocals. Has a catchy chorus. Other members do backing vocals...I like the alternating \\"yeah\\"s!    Please Mister Postman - a good cover version. John is great on lead vocals here...like the tone to his singing here. Backing vocals are tight. Has handclaps.    You really got a hold on me - a slower tempo song with John on lead vocals. He has a sort of weary singing style here, which works well, as it does for the harmonies. Has lead guitar and piano. Some 1950s style instrumental cliches, like the beat and the bass style.    All I've got to do - I'll give this song a smaller tick than the ones above: \\"~\\". A slower song with John singing...with a strong bias to the right hand speaker. Nice melodies and some harmonising on the lyrics.    Money (that's what I want) - this song gets a small tick...gave it a dot on first list (small tick beats a dot...this making sense to you?). On second listen I liked the piano and drumming more. Has a funky piano and thudding bass guitar strings. I like Ringo's drum rhythm...not sure if it is original or not. Has backing vocals and a driving rhythm (not sure if that last comment refers to the song or the backing vocals).     All my loving - this song gets a dot: \\".\\" from me. Paul sings. Has a flittering guitar and harmonies. A love ballad.      Then (\\"[.]\\"):      Devil in her heart - a mid-tempo song with a pleasant lead guitar, nice harmonies. John sings and has backing vocal support. Maracas feature too, I think.    Not a second time - features the piano. Has interesting drum fills by Ringo...might be a contender for a spot in my list of the best songs for drum elements. John sings lead here, with that glassy vocal quality which I like.       Then, on second listen (\\">[.}\\"):      Don't bother me - George sings on this, I think. A mid-tempo, 1950s American style song...has a sort of an Everly Brothers feel to it. Not bad. Has some woody percussion at the end.    Little child - has some 1950s style rhythm...like the bass guitar. The intro sounds a bit dull and thuddy but improves. Has piano and harmonica. John sings lead but uses a different voice when harmonising. Backing vocals on the left hand side speaker. The chorus vocals are catchy in a sugary kind of way.       Therest:      Till there was you - Paul sings. Has acoustic guitar and bongo type percussion...with the tappety tappety. Might be a candidate for my drum songs lists. A pleasant, slow song.     Roll over Beethoven - George seems to bluff the lead guitar solo! Not sure if he wasn't up to the required standard at the time or if he wanted it to sound like that. John sings I think...or maybe it's George? Hand clap rhythms are prominent.     Hold me tight - Paul songs. Has a 1950s style lead guitar shuffle style  (if that is the right word...which I'm not sure it is!). Has backing vocals and handclaps.     I wanna be your man - George sings, I think, but there are multi-lead vocal harmonies. Organ features at times. Lyrics seem delivered in an almost karaoke style...as if by a prim English teacher! Note to self: did Australian punk band The Saints cover this song?      Recommendations:      The Beatles -      Magical Mystery Tour. 5/5. Their greatest album. Mostly orphan singles, and the psychedelic songs are a treat.    Rubber soul. 9/10. Their greatest regular studio album.    Revolver. 4/5. Solid album.

B000002TLX|5.0|This is a great collection of hits from Richard Marx.  There were many songs I had forgotten all about.
B000002LVB|5.0|Loaded does something amazing- it shows what the Velvet Underground is like when they completely strip down their rock and roll style and just write relatively simple and straight forward melodic hard rock.      Also recently I've noticed that a TV commercial has taken the guitar riff from \\"Sweet Jane\\" and abused it with obnoxious vocals laid down on top, but we'll forget about that because THIS album contains what I believe is the ultimate version of the song.      I don't know of a better way to get the point across just how *perfect* of a rock and roll record this is.  It has no flaws, and the songwriting only continues to improve with time and age, making me believe Loaded is more rewarding than one would initially give it credit for, making it the most underrated album in the Velvet Underground's catalog.      It's a personal favorite of mine, and I honestly prefer listening to it over the other three VU albums (which is pretty shocking news to most fans, but it's true).
B0000CABBW|5.0|I've ALWAYS loooved this movie. Couldn't beat the price and it arrived on time and in great condition.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Bought this album on reputation...many critics would have it as the greatest album of all time. The track listing had never grabbed me enough to want to get the album without the reputation given to it by the critics. Anyway, I took a punt. The cd I have is listed as released in 2001, and it has the mono version of the album first, then the stereo mix of the album. There is a bonus track too, which is a reworking of one of the songs on the regular album. On first listen I gave this album 77.5/100. On second listen and after listening to the mono mix as well, it's difficult to rate. If it had 3 or 4 songs I liked as much as \\"Sloop John B\\", then it could be an easy 5/5. This album would score in the high 80s to 5/5 for me based on the fact that it is just so listenable...no more killer tracks, but no dud tracks either. That's been enough for me in the past to give an album 5/5 too. With a band like The Beach Boys, maybe there is just an expectation of lots of songs up there with their poppy best. On this album they move beyond their lyrically simple but highly infectious surf-pop confections. These songs aren't memorable to me, but I can imagine being pleasantly surprised at how pretty they are if I was to dig this album out again. Of course, \\"Sloop John B\\" is a great cover by the band, which they turned into a masterpiece. Perhaps it's wrong to expect the other songs to measure up to this? In any case, this album would be more uniform but still very strong without this classic on it...and maybe easier to score.        Overall, the album has many pleasant tracks, with symphonic elements to them at times. Lyrics have depth which their early surf-pop songs don't have...not that this was anything but a positive for those early songs. On second listen the album was just an easy listening pleasure, which I've tended to reward here in the past with high scores. A difficult album to rate...it's listenability demands a high score though. Range: 87.5 to 100/100.      Theall time classic (\\"/\\"):      Sloop John B - iconic intro. Glassy percussion. A killer pop cover of the Caribbean folk song. Has a tuba, I think and great harmonies with good variety in the voices.        The best of the rest...on second listen (\\">(.)\\"):      You still believe in me - bumped this up from a \\"[.]\\". Nice lead vocal tone and melody. Cello? Harpsichord? Has bicycle horn type sound as well.     Caroline no - Same bump up as above, but after my third listen, on the mono mix. Has chunky wooden percussion, which is nice. A pleasant track. Harpsichord, big bass notes and a pretty woodwind type of instrument. The outro features a train and barking dogs.      Then (\\"[.]\\"):       Wouldn't it be nice - album opener. Iconic lead guitar melody intro. Brass. Good stereo balance (albums of this era were experimenting with the new stereo capabilities and didn't often do stereo well by today's standards).     I know there's an answer - catchy piano, tambourine and a tuba type instrument. Double bass plays in a jazzy kind of a way. Symphonic drums. Thoughtful lyrics and a catchy chorus.       On second listen (\\">[.]\\"):      Don't talk (put your head on my shoulder) - was hoping that this was a cover of the sugar 1950s pop ballad. It's not. Only has one of the Beach Boys singing on this track. Features organ, bass, piano, violins and cymbal percussion.    Let's go away for a while - a pleasant, experimental instrumental. Drums and symphonic drums. Piano, brass, violins, twangy string instrument and xylophone (?),     God only knows - horn, bass, sleigh bells (?), interesting tone to the percussion, some sort of keyboard effect, violin and a lovely falsetto by one of the Boys.     Here today - piano, tuba, tambourine, symphonic elements like brass. Double bass note picking. Catchy verse (?) parts...I mean like the opening vocal melody.       On third listen!  (\\">[.]\\"):      I'm waiting for the day - interesting symphonic drumming and other symphonic elements feature as well. Quiet parts alternate with with percussive passages, which is a little bit catchy.     I just wasn't made for these times - bass notes, harpsichord (?), interesting percussion tones at times...(bongos?), symphonic drums at times, woodwind? I think that the mono version of this song may have that novelty instrument which was often used in the 1950s...the one where you waved your hand over an aerial type instrument which created sci-fi type noises...I forget what you call those!      The rest:      That's not me - organ, dual lead guitar, aboriginal percussion sticks sound, bass drum (?), reflective lyrics. Interesting.    Pet sounds - instrumental with symphonic elements. Maracas, brass...including a tuba, twangy lead guitar, bass, interesting drum tone and a tambourine, I think.    Hang on to your ego - A bonus track. Very similar to \\"I know there's an answer\\". Wikipedia's entry for the album version states that this bonus track was the original version, but there were concerns about supposed drug related themes...as in the title! Personally, I can't see it!        Recommendations...easy listening classics:        Fleetwood Mac - Fleetwood Mac (2nd self-titled album), Rumours    Genesis - From Genesis to Revelation    The Velvet Underground - The Velvet Underground & Nico, The Velvet Underground.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|I am hooked on Dexter, and this season is the best one yet.  It's hard to imagine how a story about a serial killer can be funny, suspenseful and scary at the same time.  John Lithgow as the villain (the \\"bad\\" serial killer) is outstanding, and the ensemble cast is really good.
0194313425|5.0|I use this book a lot to help my Spanish speaking students to work with grammar. Excellent book.
0439023513|2.0|To say that I was disappointed in Mockingjay doesn't really describe it. I am giving it two stars solely because I respect Ms. Collins as an author. I was numb after reading this book and wondering why I wasted months waiting for it come out. I seriously wondered if the publisher had ripped the book out of her hands mid-edit. I read the other two books in one or two days, and it took me a week to read this. Some times I felt like I was forcing myself to read. Which is not like me at all. The major flaws were as follows:    The characterization was WAY off. Katniss spends the whole book huddled in corners waiting for someone to do something. She doesn't play a major roll in really any of the battle sequences. She's manipulated and puppeteered the entire book. I respected her in the other two books for the very opposite reasons. She was willing to stick it to the leaders to do what she thought was right. In Mockingjay it's like she can't even think for herself anymore. Because of this, her character arc seems off. Like she regressed and never came back. Which might be true, however, just kill her off. Why should I care about a character who learns nothing other than the fact that taking morphling will help her run away from her problems? As far as the two love interests, Peeta is suddenly mean and angry when he used to be the only sane person in the entire book. I really missed the old Peeta, and I felt angry at the author for putting this stranger in his place. Maybe she was going for that, but she must have missed the mark. Because I wasn't mad at The Capitol, I was mad at her.  Then there is Gale. Gale suddenly doesn't care about human life. After watching innocent neighbors and friends gunned down and killed off, he doesn't have respect for human beings? What? It makes it really hard to respect a person whose only character point is that they are out for revenge. It also destroyed the love triangle thing for me, because the author made it blatently obvious that she wouldn't be going for Gale. These characters were not the characters I fell in love with and wanted to root for. I just didn't care about any of them anymore.     Half the book is \\"telling\\" me stuff that happened instead of \\"showing\\" me what happened. I really felt like major points were just summarized for me instead of letting me feel and react as things happen. I think Katniss wakes up in the hospital four times in this book and people just tell her how the battle went. She isn't even a main player when they go to rescue Peeta, which seemed completely opposite of what Katniss would allow. I found myself skimming...A LOT. At some points I felt like I was watching the history channel and the 'Battle of Panem' was being told by some old guy who specializes in war. You get all this war tactic crap instead of seeing aspects of war from Katniss' eyes. I just thought it was so wrong that I felt bored reading a book from a series that was the ultimate in action.     War is hell. There. I just told you the whole story. I want to get wrapped up in characters and experience what they are experiencing. Then come to conclusions about war because I care about the characters it is happening to. Instead,I felt like she was shoving anti-war sentiment down my throat the whole time. And guess what? You don't have to convince me war is horrible. I get it. I felt like the whole build up of the book, every action, every sentence, was written in order to make me hate war and the leader of District 13. Like she was holding me hand and telling me, \\"See, See how bad war and dictatorships are.\\" Truthfully, she didn't need to kill Primm to accomplish that goal. The death of tons of children pretty much works if that is what you are going for. To be honest, I thought killing Primm was a low blow. I could tell that something was off when I didn't even cry at all at Primm's death, but bawled my eyes out when the little girl was killed in the first book. Instead of making me hate Coin more, it made me hate the book and storyline more. The other thing that bugged me was that characters were built up, only to be killed off. Which is fine. BUT...give me some closure on it. It's like they get killed and then aren't mentioned again. I would hope, in real life, if someone is killed in war, that someone else is caring that they died and wishing that they could have come back. We don't get to see any of that. Just the death. None of the caring about the death. Finnick's death was the worst. She builds him up the whole book and then kills him in a one paragraph mention, and no one ever even mentions him again. Weird.    No resolution. The end of this book was similar to watching a movie where, at the end, words flash on the screen telling you what they did ten years later. The author shows this entire war sequence being played out play by excruciating play, but then gives us none of the closure with life after war. She builds up a love triangle for two books, only to conclude that love triangle with three sentences at the end, and a twenty years later retelling of how Katniss is still screwed up. She includes main characters in two books and then \\"conveniently\\" kills them in one fell swoop and introduces new characters we don't care about as much in the third. If you are going to show me the atrocities of battle, let me believe that some shred of human decency and love does still occur somewhere. I don't think I'm the only one who feels that sentiment. I would like to believe that even out of horrendous circumstances good can come. She didn't show me any of that. Just shoves the \\"War is bad\\" thing down my throat more and more.    Overall, I would say skip this book if you can. Make up your own ending to the Hunger Games. I'm sure it will be better than this book was.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I loved this for so many reasons the first time I saw in on YouTube. I love musicals. I love the cast members. A funny and creative plot and storyline. Great villain names. Etc. My only complaint is that there isn't MORE! If you like musicals, freeze rays, evil horses, or tragic love stories give this short movie a chance.
0061353248|5.0|I heard author on a radio program a few years ago and was quite intrigued by some of the thing he was saying.  I've always been fascinated by the way people make decisions.  Dan clearly demonstrates how social, environmental, and market forces influence the process of decision making.

9889979942|5.0|Afraid of flying?  Always wanted to visit the world's most populated country but don't know how you'd possibly experience all 33 provinces on your two week summer vacation?  Well, save the money that you would've spent on airfare and buy yourself-and every person that you know-a copy of China: A Portrait of a People.  Even if you had the time (and I am talking years), enough money (this guy miraculously did it on a shoestring budget), and an entourage of professional photographers in tow (he did it all by his lonesome), I think you'd still fall infinitely short of accomplishing one tenth of what this amateur turned pro did over the course of two years.  Until now, no other book, no other author, and no other photographer has managed to capture this vast country with the same crystalline clarity, honesty, poignancy and surreal beauty that is found within these pages.  This book is a literary voyage for the soul that provides those of us with a bit of wanderlust the rare opportunity to see what Mr. Carter saw and at times to feel as if you were right there beside him.
1594202559|5.0|My only criticism of this brilliantly written and superbly-researched book is the hyperbolic title: I suspect a publisher in the House.    I have read all the \\"required\\" reading on hedge funds--\\"When Genius Failed\\"; \\"Inventing Money\\"; Soros's \\"The Failure of Global Capitalism\\" and \\"The Alchemy of Finance\\"--to name the most popularly known, and none of these books does the job of the detail provided by Sebastian Mallaby. I have even read \\"Frontline\\" transcripts where Soros was interviewed, and still there is more here than from Soros himself, because Mallaby interviews more of the key participants in these transactions than you would even read in \\"The Economist\\". He interviews bankers at every level, the traders, their associates,the partners themselves...it is uncanny what is accomplished in this book.     In a world where \\"stock-picking\\" is becoming more and more difficult because most of the market movements are due less and less to sector competition, management, and EPS than they are to shifting global banking policy, currency flows and governments' attempts to control inflation and (un)employment, Mallaby's book yields the most insight cover-to-cover than I have ever read, because hedge funds are more involved in macro trading than, say, institutional investors or the mutual fund industry. And you must understand macro trading in today's markets. A superior work by a gifted author.Please do read this book.

1579125549|4.0|More than just a book of problems, Polgar's book is a training aid for serious study.<br /><br />In order to win a chess game, chess players have to solve finite problems using elements culled from complex positions. One thing that separates good players from mediocre ones is the ability to intuit significant variations from the enormous cloud of possibilities each chess game offers to find the lines of play most likely to lead to advantage.<br /><br />It is in this that Polgar's book differs from games collections and other books on strategy and tactics. Polgar's goal is not to give a bored or weak player something to pin his hopes on so he can say, \\"Ooh, I just went through 1000 spectacular combinations!\\" or, \\"Ooh, I just read a book on Alekhine!\\" His approach is different: his intent is to give the player the ability to recognize tactical themes buried in positions by flooding the player with thousands of tactical short problems in an attempt to imprint his readers with the kind of resource of experience that is the basis of the intuitive ability that great players have. More than just a book of mates in three moves, or five moves, Polgar's chess tries to teach the player to recognize possibilities for goal-directed play in any situation that may come before him or her.<br /><br />If anything can be said to be `weak' in Polgar's approach, it is the lack of prose in it that limits the scope of its approach. A monograph on Capablanca's games can point out that tactical sequences can have purely positional goals, while Polgar sticks to the flashy, romantic idea of attack. Understanding Polgar completely would turn a player into a tactical monster, but understanding Capablanca leads to a player's deeper understanding of what works in chess in a broader and more useful sense.<br /><br />Another difficulty in the book is its sheer volume and the time it takes to work with it: many players are put off by the enormous amount of work it implies; they want something easier, not realizing that the magic they are looking for to make them stronger is right in front of them.<br /><br />There are a many reasons to recommend Polgar's Chess, the greatest of which is Polgar's best credential as a chess coach: that is, three daughters who happen to be Grandmasters. The approach in Polgar's book touches on the nature-versus-nurture question by asking which is more likely: did massive training early on in life make his three daughters world-class chess players, or does he happen to be the father of three geniuses?<br /><br />Only the first answer makes sense.<br /><br />This book needs a kindle edition in a big way.

0439023521|4.0|I put off reading this book for the longest time, mainly because I don't like novels written in the first-person, present-tense point of view.  I still don't, but I have to admit that this book kept me entertained.  I read most of it in one sitting, and now I'm itching to read the next two in the series.  The characters are unforgettable and the story (while not entirely original) is sure to keep me thinking about it for a while.<br /><br />This is definitely something fans of YA dystopian fiction would love.  While it's not perfect, it's undoubtedly engaging and engrossing.  I can't wait to read the next two books.
B002N5N5M0|2.0|This is by far the weakest season of the Dexter series.  The John Lithgow character is predictable and uninteresting and Dexter's interminable musings about family life are boring.  The romance between two police officers adds nothing to the plot and Dexter's sister is annoying as ever.  The only redeeming feature of this season is that finally we're rid of the world's dumbest woman.

B002VECMAE|3.0|After his failed marriage, a journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) flies to Kuwait. He intends to \\"prove himself\\" by reporting the war in Iraq, but what he encountered is an ex-special forces agent Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), who claims he had been engaged in covert activities for the US military. And his \\"activities\\" are not just espionage or sabotage. The special unit was solely dedicated to researches on psychic powers.    While Bob and Lyn travel together, Lyn recounts in flashbacks his young days as a \\"promising\\" recruit, special training organized by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), a veteran and founder of select government-sponsored psychic soldiers, and rivalry with Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey), another skilled \\"Jedi warrior,\\" who is more attracted to the dark side.     \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" is a typical example of disappointing writing ruining an interesting material. The comedy is inspired by the book written by Jon Ronson (which I haven't read). I don't know how much of the film's material I should take seriously, but it is certainly interesting. Acting is very good, with many funny bits here and there.     However, these bits are better than the whole. The main story about disillusioned Bob's self-discovery is not very compelling, and characters, which should be much more unique, come off flat, not as engaging as amusing deadpan jokes delivered by the actors. Supports from Robert Patrick and Stephen Lang add little to the entire film.    \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" is not a mess. It is smart, knows what it wants to be. Only that it doesn't know the effective way to be that.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|Judge for yourself, or your self... but as myself and myself's friend [ ;-) ] watched the suspenseful gore last night, and enjoyed the French and German spoken, I was diverted again and again by thinking \\"nominative, accusative, dative...\\" and \\"where is the reflexive used in German, and English, and in early 21st century street English?\\"    Why?  The otherwise serviceable subtitles are sometimes bizarre, when rendering solid German into demented English.  Not consistently, but too-commonly, and frustratingly so.  It discredits both languages.    So someone did not grow up hearing King James' \\"As FOR ME and my house, we will serve the Lord.\\"  That same someone surely has English prepositions rattling too freely around in his/her head that are NOT anchored: for me, to me, with me...    And someone else signed off on the subtitles generated.    It seems a deep and ironic (and un-elaborated) commentary on reflexive violence: it turns... on the perpetrator?  Even in such subtle ways, as language.

0425170349|5.0|Before I even knew of the existence of this book, I was a huge fan of the Video Game series. Wanting to read a good Video Game tie-in book, I read this. This was by FAR one of the best books I have ever read. This book got me interested in Tom Clancy's Novels, and I then read \\"Clear and Present Danger\\", another absolute winner, but not quite as good as Rainbow Six. If you like Special Ops or the game series at all, READ THIS BOOK!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I'm not sure at all why this movie did not make it to a 5 star status instead of 4.5 star.  It was one of the most powerful films I've ever seen and will make you think about it long after watching it.  I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys an intellgent movie with outstanding acting.  This is not either a chick flick or a guy film.  Everyone will enjoy this.
1416550542|5.0|The best book I've read in a long time!  I couldn't put it down!  Lots of adventure and twists and turns.  READ IT!
1401217109|5.0|This \\"book\\" is an ambitious, epic, jumbled compendium of genius.  Only the twisted, brilliant mind of Alan Moore could create a masterpiece like this.  What is it about- what is the plot? I don't really know.  I do know that it's a series of many plots, from the many classic stories that inform Alan Moore's work.  There is no better read writer in comics than Alan Moore- nowhere can you read of so many myths, fables and stories in the same volume.  Some of it reaches the greatest heights, while other parts of it are a jumbled mess, especially the part that lampoons \\"On The Road\\" by Kerouac.  Tell me a book that includes erotic tales, pornographic cartoons, Shakespearean plays, the story of Orlando in comic form, a parody of \\"On The Road\\" and spy genre.  Oh, and several pages of mind-blowing 3-D comics.    This hardcover book is one of the only books that even plays with the very physical thing that is a book.  Each part of the book is actually printed on different stock of paper, and different sizes at times.  The 3-D portion is amazingly entertaining.  (Full Disclosure: I'm so sick of 3D movies I vow to never see another one again- yet this 3D comic really pops off the page).    What is it all about?  Ultimately, it's a celebration of the glory that is storytelling, the creative mind.  Readers of \\"Fables\\" will recognize the story is actually about... stories! Moore finally lays out his theme of joyous, rampant, mad creativity when the wizard at the end says:    \\"Rejoice! Imagination's quenchless pyre burns on, a beacon to eternity, it's triumphs culture's proudest pinnacles when great wars are ingloriously forgot.  Here is our narrative made paradise, brief tales made glorious continuity.  Here champions and lovers are made safe from bowdlerizer's quill, or fad, or fact.  Here are brave banners of romance unfurled...to blaze forever in a blazing world!\\"

B0034G4OVS|4.0|This movie was fairly entertaining, more than I hoped for (expected it to be pretty terrible). It has the cliche young college idiots who only care about smoking weed, etc. Their dialogue was often annoying in the beginning and barely has you paying attention. But once they get stuck up there, the challenge of getting down or staying there for 5 days is quite frightening. There were also some grotesque scenes that I haven't seen in other movies. Watch for the shock factor, but don't have ridiculous expectations. The only thing that bothered me was the lack of mist in their breath from the cold!! It was a pretty enjoyable film. Since the DVD is so cheap it's worth getting for me and the movie has replay value.
B002ZG977Y|2.0|It's very disappointing that you have two good (or at least better) sources for a story line (either the original myth or the original movie) and you still can't come up with anything compelling. The whole plot thread of humans rebelling against the gods just seemed ridiculously contrived. It also seemed as if the writer's/producer were trying to weave in other films' ideas to give some support to their own movie - the Zeus/Hades plot reminded me a great deal of Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief and there also seemed to be a nod or two to 300 (ugh!) but nothing sufficiently new to make the story stand on it's own two feet.  Basically, I saw this as a mish-mash of the original (movie)story, which someone clearly didn't think was good enough, with a bunch of half realized other ideas.  The effects were nice but even they couldn't carry the film for me.  I also felt as if the actors were just not completely involved.  Maybe they all had other things to get to when they were done filming or maybe they were just embarassed to be part of this film.  It's hard to say. I finished watching the film primarily because I had nothing else to do that night.
1594488916|5.0|A delightful page-turner that chronicles a book thief and a rare book seller/amateur detective.  Bartlett brings the reader into the world of rare books, opens up the world of John Gilkey, the book thief, and shares her love of books with the reader.  My wife happened to see this book on the library shelf and thought of me because of the title.  I began reading it and finished it within a few days.  I highly recommend this book.  Great job by Allison Hoover Bartlett.
0786955570|5.0|It has been years since I've played the D&D RPG game, and although I'm interested in the new D&D 4th edition of the RPG, I don't have the time for an on-going RPG game. This board game is a fantastic game that satisfies my desire to play the new D&D experience.     The board game rules are fast and easy to learn and play. The odds of winning are seriously stacked against the heroes, mainly due to the Encounters deck of cards. The Encounters are relentless, and I would contribute every game I've played and lost to the cards coming out of the Encounters deck.     In fact, I've lost every game I've played so far, but that just keeps me coming back for more because I know the eventual victory will be oh so sweet.     The only downfall to this game is that a FAQ needs to be published concerning many of the Encounter cards. Some of the text is vague, and open to interpretation during the game. When in doubt, I usually opt for what feels more difficult; since everything else in the game is so difficult.     I know a second big-box game is on the way, Wrath of Ashardalon, but I also can't wait for the eventual expansions for this game.

We drank wine and watched the show.  All my friends who had missed it before were instant fans and are watching the new season. It's a definitely a must see!
B000641D2Y|5.0|This movie is just plain fun. A Christmas family classic to watch together with a big bowl of popcorn, and good hearty laughs. Hilarious mix of family noise, sibling fighting, holiday rushing, mindless miscommunication, all in the spirit of each one trying to selfishly make their own Christmas special. Throw in a youngster glad to get \\"lost\\" from his family during all this mess, land in NYC, sneak into a suite at The Plaza, shop NY's best toy stores, and bag two mindless idiots (aka \\"The Sticky Bandits\\") with a whole host of booby-traps in a vacant rowhouse. And there's even some good heart-touching scenes on loving the homeless and finding friendship in the most unsuspecting of places.....You've got a fun evening in this movie!
030745455X|1.0|I read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.  While I wanted to find out what had happened to the missing girl, the book was way too detailed in brand names, what people ate, and what they purchased.  Also, there is a lot of coffee drinking.  Don't these characters have any water sources nearby?? And, if I wasn't appalled enough at the mention of the characters' over-sexed lives (having sex with whomever comes along....like a bunch of animals.....no matter what gender), The Girl Who Played With Fire was wayyyyy worse in this area.  In fact, I finally chunked the book in a water filled bath tub and then into the trash.  Really?  Is it really necessary to put such trash in any novel that is supposed to center around a mystery.  I found it so disgusting and distacting because the filth would pop up randomly (and had absolutely NOTHING to do with the plot), that I couldn't even force myself to finish the book.  I think the author is/was a complete pervert.  Read something worthwhile like The Glass Castle, Water for Elephants, or Mercy.

Did notice this headset make a squzzing noise sometimes when you adjust it. As long as there's something playing in the headset, you won't notice
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I truly enjoyed this novel.  I wasn't too sure if I would even like it.  It sounded like it might be a bit much, a bit melodramatic.  It wasn't.      I lost myself in the story each time I began reading. I read The House at Riverton, and really liked that novel.  But I liked this one even more.  I hated to finish this novel and still find myself thinking of the characters...after several weeks.  Ms. Morton's writing makes you feel that you are there.  I could smell the sea air, feel the salt spray, hear the sounds at the wharf when she described the port.  Ditto for the other locales.  I did not have any trouble following the shifts back in forth in time.  I also found the female characters to be fully developed (some were sympathetic, others not), but all were fully drawn. Ms. Morton has a true knack for building a sense of foreboding..and maintaining it.  There were times when I found myself putting the book down because I feared what would happen next, only to find myself picking it up again, because I couldn't bear to NOT know what was going to happen..ha!     Another reviewer pointed out the only small drawback that I noted:  The romance at the end that didn't really seem to fit.  The other reviewer pointed out that it almost seemed that an editor said, \\"Put in a romance\\", so Ms. Morton accommodated the request.  I agree with that reviewer's point.  A small detail and one that certainly did not interfere with my overall enjoyment of the book.    A wonderful read.  I can't wait for her next novel, due in November!
B001U887P6|4.0|Buy your regular size not your \\"Crocs size\\". You don't feel the nubs on the soles like regular Crocs, there are none.  They are warm and cozy.  Happy with this purchase.  Great price with free shipping.
0374531943|5.0|Even if you have only a passive interest in NASA and the space program, this book is very informative. Astronaut Michael Collins makes the space program accessible for the average reader and doesn't try to hide his mistakes, like losing a camera during the Gemini 10 mission. He is also very candid about how he really felt about being the guy left in lunar orbit while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the moon.
1931559317|4.0|Many reviews have already extolled the virtues of this atlas: the wonderful look and feel (in the tradition of Becvar and Tirion's Cambridge atlas), the convenient size (take it on field trips or read it in bed), the spiral binding that allows it to lie flat, the hard thinking that has obviously gone into the layout. Constellation figures, tick. Clear constellation names, tick. Extensive inclusion of star names, plus locations of some nearby stars that didn't make the magnitude cutoff, tick.    Some reviews have called it your ultimate reference, but because of its one downside, this it cannot be. I purchased it to be something midway between Tirion's Star Atlas 2000.0 (1st ed. to mag 6.5, yes I know it's old now...) and the 3 volume Millenium Star Atlas (too heavy for anywhere but the desk). But despite covering more stars with a higher zoom than Tirion's atlas, it uses less star labels.    Take Leo Minor for example, hardly a constellation where congestion would be a problem. Tirion's map is about 50% smaller, yet I had to copy the following Flamsteed numbers from Tirion into Sinnott's: 7, 9, 13, 22-24, 27, 32-35, 38, 40, 43-44, 48, 50. It seems like more are omitted than included, and the fact that I was able to pencil them in means that there was plenty of space for the publishers to be a bit more generous. In the southern hemisphere, e Eri/82 G. Eri is a large, nameless dot (an important star, one of the closest to the Sun). This was extremely disappointing, and I considered rating it only 3 stars (after all, these labels are one of the primary reasons to buy an atlas), but the other positives pursuaded me, at length, to award it 4 . . . just.    To finish on a positive note, they did print Rho Aql correctly: it recently slipped into Delphinus, and now has to be printed with its constellation name as well as its Greek designation. Good one.    Richard @ [...]

B002ZG98LO|1.0|I have always been a fan of the original Predator film, in fact it's one of my favourite action films from the 80's. The sequel was quite honestly awful and the Aliens vs Predator films shouldn't have even been made, they were so bad. So all-in-all this series hasn't got the best of reputations, despite it's awesome original and it's fantastic comic books. So when I heard that there was going to be a new movie I was a little disheartened but hearing Robert Rodriguez was attached made me feel a bit better about it.     Well, I watched this last night and I have to say I cannot believe that there is a film that is actually worse than AvP! The story is ridiculous. The characters are pathetic and are complete wannabes of the classic original line-up, but nowhere near as cool (if cool at all!) - and what's with Aiden Brody's Batman voice?? And what was honestly the point of Lawrence Fishburn's character? And Danny Trego was a wasted opportunity as he was the only real tough guy out of the whole cast. You don't actually get to see a Predator (other than the one tied up) for about 45 minutes - by then I'd already pretty much given up with the film that I didn't care when I saw one.     Everything about this film is bad. I hated it. One star.

1400052173|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it was a well written story about a very remarkable situation concerning the ownership of one's cells.  The story skips back and forth and weaves a remarkable story to enjoy, but raises so many bigger questions concerning the rights of science and our individual rights regarding our cells and other body parts.  I so wanted someone to step up and reward the family for the years of pain and not knowing.
B003L20IHE|4.0|These brief and admittedly superficial comments are just some impressions on having seen the still new movie, \\"Charlie St-Cloud\\", that stars Zac Efron.  The film is a bit silly and weepily sentimental, but it provides Zac with many chances to pose beautifully his increasingly hunky body, \\"hunkily man\\" now rather than \\"hunkily teenage boy\\".  I wish that Efron had shown more bare skin, which, of course, is what everybody really wants to see in this kind of commercial endeavour, but he was shirtless at times.  (At some other times, his t-shirt would be soaking wet and clinging sexily to his \\"hard\\" body, very suggestively.)  Actually, Efron's acting is quite good; any faults are of the script, not his, for his acting really is exceptionally fine, certainly better than that of most of the other principal and secondary characters.<br /><br />Zac even has pre-marital sex in this film, quite a change for this Disney studio-famed star!  That is going to shock some of his fans -- or, more likely, their parents and other cackling adults.  The sex, though, is quite discrete.  If it is there in the novel (which I have not read), then it would have to be in the film, too, to render the book cinematically with some fidelity.  The impressive, tranquil beauty of the sylvan setting of the film, which rivals the romantic couple's humanly physical allure for attention, is almost reason enough to see this movie.<br /><br />This is not my favourite Zac Efron film, so far.  That honour goes to \\"17 Again\\", in which the \\"eye candy\\" charms of Efron are on more display, especially in those clinging, sweat-soaked gym outfits, in an entertaining and amusing film (one that has more focus and skill in script and in some other important other ways) in which Zac Efron acts utterly to perfection, much better, in fact, than too many critics are willing to admit.  Often Zac Efron transcends \\"his material\\" (the films) in a most gratifying way, and he does that again in \\"Charlie St-Cloud\\".
B001BNFR6W|3.0|I wish the quality of the dvd's were better. I was thrilled to be able to purchase the entire series of Will & Grace at such a good price for my daughters birthday present.

B00003CXTG|3.0|Given its immense sweep, its intense subject matter, and the caliber of its production values, PEARL HARBOR should be a Five Star shoo-in. That it isn't has nothing to do with the retelling of the history. which is accurate within moderate limits and powerfully presented. The battle sequences are grand set-pieces with plenty of pyrotechnics and action.<br /><br />Where PEARL HARBOR lets the viewer down is its insistence on exploiting every war-movie cliche in the book. That by itself might be endearing, but the three lead characters, badly mishandled, reduce this movie from David Lean proportions to Nora Ephron economy size. Not that there's anything wrong with Nora Ephron pictures, but to tell the story of Pearl Harbor in film, a director needs characters with a Zhivago-like passion, not a YOU'VE GOT MAIL romantic-comedy blandness.<br /><br />Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) are lifelong friends who both love to fly, both join the Army Air Corps, both take up duty at Pearl Harbor, and both participate in the \\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\\" Doolittle Raid of 1942 (Alec Baldwin plays a more-than-passable Jimmy Doolittle). As buddies, Rafe and Danny work wonderfully together. They become heroes at Pearl, managing to get airborne to shoot down seven Japanese planes together (a fictional turn that works well).<br /><br />The fly in the ointment is Kate Beckinsale, or rather Kate Beckinsale's character, Evelyne, or rather, what gets done with Evelyne. The love triangle that develops between Evelyne and Danny and Evelyne and Rafe is hackneyed, predictable, and vaguely unappetizing. It is a major failing that brings PEARL HARBOR down several large notches. Evelyne's emotional shift from Rafe to Danny (though understandable under the circumstances) is so complete and she is so without regret that Evelyne becomes a cruel, unsympathetic and undesirable woman. The viewer is left to feel that Rafe and Danny are sacrificing their brothers'-bond for a worthless and wanton woman.<br /><br />This is tragic, because up until that point, Kate Beckinsale is perfectly desirable as the Forties pin-up dream girl (and she looks lovely in a starched white nurse's uniform, to boot). It seems that Danny and Rafe feel the same way, because their anger toward each other flares and sputters unconvincingly. In the end, it's obvious that they love each other far more than either of them loves Evelyne. And perhaps that's all for the best.<br /><br />By focusing more on this contrived love triangle and less on the characters' response to their role as unwitting participants in history, PEARL HARBOR doesn't make the grade.agic, because up until that point, Kate Beckinsale is perfectly desirable as the Forties pin-up dream girl (and she looks lovely in a starched white nurse's uniform, to boot).

B002ZG97V0|5.0|This good vs. evil treat to the eyes, begins with an owl family nested in the hollow of a large old tree. (I believe they were white snowy owls if I have my breeds correct.) Two younger male owls (brothers) and their baby sister are looked after by parents and a snake nanny named Mrs. P.  The young males are learning to fly and are also told the battle stories of the great Guardians (the great owls) who keep peace and protect the masses.  One of the young males is mesmerized by the tales, so much so that they are told to go to bed before they are up all night with \\"Daymares\\" :-).<br /><br />When they are supposed to be asleep, the brothers sneak out to practice flying and wind up on the ground, a no-no for an owl.  Approached by danger, they are grabbed in the nick of time by other owls, who carry them off into the night, only to become enslaved to serve an elite group of owls called \\"The Pure Ones\\" and their evil leader \\"Metal Beak\\" and his beautiful but nasty queen.<br /><br />Of course, the Pure Ones are anything but pure-in-heart.  They kidnap young owls to serve their power kick to take over the owl world.  The \\"lucky\\" ones get to fight for the cause.  The unlucky ones get to pick up mouse pellets (the fur balls owls cough up after they eat a mouse - yuk) and throw them into some sort of energy recycling machine that zaps other owls.  The unlucky ones got \\"moonblinked\\" --kind of mind-zapped into servant zombies.<br /><br />In a quest to save the goodness in the owl world from the evil-doers, our hero sets out to find the Guardians at the Great Tree and release the enslaved.<br /><br />I found the CGI stunning and the imbedded messages to be that you can achieve your widest dreams in this approximate 90 minute film.  It was pretty adventure filled.  We also had the strong message of good fighting evil, of strong friendships and caring for each other along with love of family.  It was also a \\"tap into the strength within\\" film. I loved it.<br /><br />As a side note, there is some violence that may frighten the very young children.  If your children are young and sensitive, you may want to see it first yourself.  This is a power fight with a \\"the strong shall survive the weak\\" mentality by the bad guys.ighten the very young children.

My favorite songs are Billie Jean, Beat It, Human Nature, and Wanna Be Startin Something. The only song on here I skip over is Thriller. The video was hot but the song . . . not so much! Very overrated. Sucks thats all non fans know about him. Long Live The True King
1603580557|5.0|A great book by a great communicator and thinker. A while ago I realized that the truly brilliant people were not the ones that dazzled with complex thoughts. but those can  communicate complex concepts in a conversational manner. In that,  Donella Meadows was truly brilliant. The book is an excellent starting point for systems thinking. The chapter Leverage Points in a System is a paradigm changer. Her book LImits to Growth is a tour de force on sustainability - written in 1972 (and updated every 10-20 years) it's scary relevant. Read anything and everything she wrote or was involved in.

That said, overall, he did well, and fans of these songs will appreciate his somewhat fresh perspective on them.

0345505387|1.0|Very disappointed in the book!  Probably the worst of her Outlander series and I have purchased and read all of them.  I felt the artwork was totally inappropriate for the story - the faces were never the same so it was difficult to tell who was who and they had an oriental look to them which is completely WRONG as the characters were European.  As a result of this book, I will no longer buy or read any of Diana Gabaldon's books.
B00004TJKI|5.0|This is a \\"must see\\" for fans of Stewart, Court room drama, and murder stories.  It is a true story, that was magnificiently directed by Otto Preminger,  on the actual location where it originally took place!  That is Marquette Mi., a city I am quite familiar with.<br />The original book, named the city as Thunder Bay, Ontario.  The film calls it Iron City Michigan, which is apropos, because mining for iron and copper was major in the area, at the time the film was produced.<br /><br />It is a great story of a seldom used, and almost never sucessful, defense for an admitted murderer.<br />That defense is \\"Insanity.\\"<br /><br />This DVD of the original film, details the story reverently, and truly, compared to the original book...  (Wich was written by the Judge who actually heard the case.  He also plays the role of the sheriff in the film!) {Many \\"locals\\" and CBS personell played bit parts.}<br /><br />This aint your average movie folks.  It's 2 hours 43 minutes long, and it RIVITING!<br />If you want to see what the black and white, bare basic, Court Room Murder story, of REAL events was like...<br /><br />BUY THIS DVD!
0785145494|5.0|I've owned the original printing of this collection for years, and I've read it several times over.  Part of the reason that this story works better than many of the modern storylines is that the struggle is not exclusively about action.  When power levels reach a certain apex, there is no point.  Would seeing Thanos singlehandedly wipe out all the heroes make for a satisfying comic?  Maybe, but there wouldn't be much re-reading value in that.  Instead, this story deals more with Thanos's psychological problems, partially because of his fascination with Death, but also with his pursuit of power and his inability to deal with being (effectively) a god.    The writing is nice.  While many of the characters are a part of the Marvel Universe that I usually don't read (being primarily a Spider-Man fan) the characters - and their abilities - are made clear, without any heavy exposition to introduce characters (such as recounting their origin, or constantly dropping their name).    In comparison to some of the other Marvel event stories - This is a step above Secret Wars, if only because that story should have been trimmed down a little bit.  This is also a step above Infinity War and Crusade.    I haven't read too many of the tie-ins to this title though.  But based on what I saw in the Infinity Crusade collection, that was probably a good thing.

Unfortunately, the only drawing classes I could find for her age were for coloring Zerox copies of other drawings or gluing color paper on other drawings.

The same day it arrived, she spent the whole afternoon following the lessons and drawings on the book. The next day she got more advanced drawing books from the library.     This book has been instrumental in bringing the passion of drawing back into her life. The book is very simple, easy to read and follow. It is for beginners and young age. I highly recommend it.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I'm not going to write any long boring review - I will just say this:    Featuring thirteen tracks played either on acoustic guitar or piano or a lovely combination of the two, Once (the movie) is a showcase for two people who are musicians first and actors second.     The songs here take you through the journey of the characters in the movie, but unlike most movie musical soundtracks, it doesn't feel overproduced or contrived. Instead it is a feeling as if you have happened to wander into a coffee shop jam session between a couple of singer/songwriters.    One track in particular is featured in the movie's trailer and is what really enticed me as a music lover to pick up this album (and since it's not available in India - purchase it off Amazon) - \\"Falling Slowly\\" is simplistic in its honesty and pared down guitar. It gives Hansard a chance to lay out his gravelly vocals. When he and Irglová come together on the chorus, well... brace yourself for that moment that comes along every one hundred songs or so when chills race down your arms and you are moved near to tears.    I love the Soundtrack in its entirety and also endorse the movie.
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|this movie has no genre because life has no genre.  it's funny, it's moving, witty so much that it feels like a true story.  it's about looking past the conventional beauty and closer to the subtle dynamics that is the human condition.  i almost cry at the part when ricky zooms his camera past the conventionally attractive angela doing a stripper pose because he'd rather see jane's subtle smile in the vanity mirror.  it's about things and people who are not what they appear to be on the surface.  some of the best performances ever seen on a movie screen.  it's so human it feels like a play, but still has some high-concept cinematic flair in its own right.

B001HN694K|2.0|I had high expectations. The movie was good, but not nearly as good as I was expecting. The animations were a mixed bag. Some of the characters turned out really well and others not so much.    Only two stars because of the Blu-ray transfer. Disappointment for sure.   Upset that the aspect is 1.78:1 and the original was 1.85.1. This blows for those of us with CIH setups. Our blu-ray from netflix had DTS-HD Master Audio at 5.1, not 6.1.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|The fourth season of \\"Dexter\\" is the best one yet!!  Thrills, chills and kills at every turn.  The \\"Trinity\\" killer is Dexter's most challenging opponent ever and there's excitement through and through.  New characters are introduced, and Dexter grapples with the roles of husband & father co-existing with the serial killer he is.  There isn't a season-ending cliffhanger, but the final episode is one of the series' best -- well written and great acting combined with the intensity that only \\"Dexter\\" can provide.  A 5-star viewing experience and every \\"Dexter\\" fan must see this season in its entirety!!  Every actor/actress in this TV show is a better-than-ever performer.  Kudos to the entire cast & crew!!  The downside is wondering whether this season can ever been topped.

0971407614|5.0|I recommend this book if you are already pretty fit and are familiar with bodyweight exercise.  He doesn't re-invent the wheel, but there is solid advice and a few exercises in here that I had never done and have since added to my repertoire.  I mostly purchased this book as a referrence that I can use when writing my own workouts so I don't forget about certain exercises and for creating new exercises.  Beginning exercisers may find the exercises in this book quite difficult or intimadating. But that should not stop you, he has a lot of exercises that are challenging for all levels of exercisers and if they were to follow some of the suggested workout formats in the book they would soon find themselves doing many of the advanced exercises in this book without ever lifting a dumbbell.  If you are debating buying an expensive membership to a gym or buying this book, my advice is to buy this book first and follow a week of his suggested workouts and you'll see that no exercise machine you can find in a gym compares to the ultimate piece of exercise equipment you already own-YOUR BODY!  Use the money you saved on the gym membership for a shopping spree for clothes to fit your new fabulously fit and trim physique.

0307591549|5.0|I've read a lot of \\"happiness\\" books and frankly when I chose this book I was a little pessimistic about learning anything new.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This book, while building on a lot of prior research, is full of new insights and presentation that is refreshingly insightful and helpful.  I learned a lot and it was a compelling and convincing read.  There is a wealth of useful and practical takeaways from the material.  The author works in the real world and doesn't just write from a position in academia and thus has a lot more practical real-world experience than you often find in these types of books mostly written by psychology professors.  I consider this one of the best I've read and I highly recommend it.
B001E3AXGS|4.0|When I hear that a book won a Pulitzer, my skepticism gene goes into overdrive. My skepticism about Pulitzers has been in double overdrive ever since I read a claim that \\"Profiles in Courage\\" got the Pulitzer because Joe Kennedy used his influence with the members of the committee to get his boy Jack an extra dose of favorable publicity among the intelligensia. In my experience, a Pulitzer requires that the book meet the desires of the very narrow group who make the decisions for the prize. Its politics have to be in tune with theirs as must its social stance. So, I approached this book with a strong \\"show me\\" attitude.       Having finished it, I conclude that this time the Pulitzer committee picked something that is truly outstanding. First, off, the writing is superb. Second, the telling of the story is equally good. I don't have to believe that Lincoln was quite that good at running things in general or quite that skilled at controlling his team to find the story that Goodwin tells fascinating.       Among the things I took away from this book is a appreciation of Lincoln's skill as a writer. Of course, I am familiar with the mastery of the Gettysburg Address and of the Second Inaugural Address. Goodwin showed me that those came out of a whole stream of good writing reaching back into Lincoln's younger days. Something else I found fascinating was the detailed story of just exactly how Lincoln ended up with the 1860 nomination. Last is the description of Lincoln's personal friendships with some of his cabinet, especially Seward and Stanton. Even if there wasn't quite as much sweetness and light as Goodwin describes (she does mention quite a bit of conflict as it is), the story itself is heartwarming.       I'll have to look into some more of Mrs. Goodwin's work. The lady has considerable talent.
B000SEIDR0|1.0|The paperback of this book can be purchased for $7.49 with free shipping via Amazon Primes and I can get it in two days. If I get the paperback, Amazon and the publisher have to pay for printing, shipping several times, handling, etc. And I get a book I can resell or loan out.   a  By comparison, the Kindle version costs an outrageous $12.99. With that Amazon and the publisher pay nothing for printing, shipping, handling, etc. I may get the book electronically within seconds but for the privilege of that I am supposed to pay 85% more? That is ridiculous.    I like my kindle, alot. But it is going to grow dusty on the shelf if Amazon prices Kindle books at almost two times the paperback price (probably more than 2x once I add the value to me of the ability to loan or resell).     This is a great book but I must seriously ding the Kindle version as way over priced.
B0020H47EQ|4.0|\\"Indecent Proposal\\" became one of my very favorite films from the first viewing.  Over the years I have watched it several times and enjoy just as much as the first time.  Never being much of a Woody Harrelson fan, 'Proposal', to me, is his best work and and the rest of the characters were cast perfectly.  Say what you will about Demi Moore, but she was stylish and also gave one of her best performances.  Robert Redford is a pleasure to watch in any role he plays.  The story is original and Adrian Lyne struck a jackpot in portraying devoted lovers faced with a difficult proposition that will either make or break them..  I'll say no more as it will spoil it for others, but if you love sappy love flics, check this one out.
0375751513|3.0|The most disappointing part of this book is that it read more like a non-fiction philosophy book than a story or novel. I would say 70% of the pages were portrayed as thoughts of a character or a speech of a character contemplating life, women, how we are suppose to live, etc.<br /><br />The actual story was hidden throughout the book, but you have to drone on through many pages to find it. The story itself is highly predictable and yet still has many missing parts to it. Many years of Dorian Gray's life is missing where it is hinted to that he commit's the most awful sins. I think reading of those sinful actions was to be more entertaining than the rabbit trails that Wilde goes on.<br /><br />Despite these facts, I am glad that I read the book once. It held my attention enough and was brilliant enough that I did learn something from the book, which is a great accomplishment in itself, to teach a reader a few principals that may slightly help or change on any small level, the readers actions. So I do recommend this book if you have no more pressing serious books on your reading list.<br /><br />On a side note, I do disagree with all the reviews I have seen on this book where the reader says that they can not relate to Dorian Gray's sins and that his sins are outdated. His chief sins in the book are (SMALL SPOILER ALERT) murder, drug use, pride, treating others harshly and without respect, using women in many ways, etc. are all sins practiced today even if they are not practiced exactly the way they are in the book. If you can relate to none of those sins in any way, then you are a better person than I, or suffer from foolish pride which is the chief sin in the book.

B00007JVBI|5.0|This is her best by a stretch, that's pretty much fact. It features the best songwriting of her career in an album of enough variety that it doesn't all sound the same like The Greatest.

The emotive songs (ie. \\"Maybe Not\\", \\"I Don't Blame You\\", \\"Names\\") are balanced by the bigger rock songs (\\"He War\\"). In this way alone it is her most complete work.     PS. Amazon reviews are usually lame on items with such personal tastes. We generally only review things we want to give 5 stars to. Don't we?

As the heading of the book indicates - \\"get things done right the first time.\\" Larry & Ram also discusses The Seven Essential Behaviors of a Leader.    As an entrepreneur, investor and sales growth specialist,  execution is close to my heart.  Without Execution, all the brilliant leadership talk is just that, talk.

030726999X|5.0|I have to say that the third book of \\"The Girl\\" trilogy was the best.  As Lisbeth's story unfolds, it becomes more and more intriguing.  Of course, it's often hard to believe her almost super powers, but when you realize these powers are based on intelligence rather than just brute strength, it's that more believable.  These stories have also been an insight into the political issues in Sweden and it's refreshing to know we Americans are not alone in our struggles.  I hope the fourth book is published as I wait for it with great anticipation.  What a tragedy that the author never saw his efforts become such a great success.  My husband, who is not generally a voracious reader, could not put this book down.  He was actually breathing down my neck for me to finish once he finished the second book.
044654759X|5.0|Fans know what to expect from Nicholas Sparks: a compelling love story centered on two appealing individuals. In SAFE HAVEN, readers find that --- and much more. This gripping tale of love and survival begins with Katie, a young woman working as a waitress in the North Carolina town of Southport. As she takes orders and delivers meals, she remembers how grateful she was when the owner hired her. At that time, she had been without food for two days. Today, as always, Katie scans the crowd, noticing people and watching them. Although the customers all seem innocent and no one has been asking about her, her hands still sometimes tremble while her heart pounds. Even with her blonde hair shorn short and dyed brown, men notice her --- unfortunately. Attention is the last thing she wants.    After hours of scrubbing and painting, Katie has made a cozy home in the shabby cottage she can afford to rent. She appreciates that it's a solitary spot at the end of an out-of-the-way gravel road. One morning, as she's enjoying a cup of coffee on her porch, she's startled to hear a voice from the previously deserted cottage next to hers. A thirty-something woman with long curly dark hair stands on the dilapidated porch, holding a rug as if deciding whether to shake it or not. The woman introduces herself as Jo; she confides that she is from Southport, has returned after going away, and would like to fix up her cottage the way Katie has. Soon, they're sharing coffee. Although Katie doesn't yet trust anyone enough to confide in, little does she know that she and Jo are beginning an important and necessary friendship.    When Jo and Katie part, Katie mentions that she plans to walk to Fisher's, the local store. Jo asks if she has met the gray-haired owner. Katie says she's seen him a couple of times. The story shifts to the store owner, Alex, who loves his small shop. Alex has been the single parent of two young children since his wife, Carly, died. All of his energy is spent keeping anindependent grocery store viable and being a father to Josh and Kristen. Although a year has passed since he lost Carly, and although he is lonely, he's had no interest in a new romantic relationship.    But he can't help being intrigued by Katie, the mysterious newcomer in town. Alex tries to engage her in conversation, but the young woman barely responds in a fearful whisper. The only time he glimpses an unguarded moment or two is when his daughter speaks with Katie. One day, as Katie pays for her meager groceries, an unexpected near-tragedy draws the two together temporarily. It is the tiniest opening of a door. Will it be enough for Alex to make a connection with this mystifying woman?    Meanwhile, Katie's secret is slowly and tantalizingly revealed to readers. We are privy to her terror, which is wholly understandable. As we learn that Katie is certainly not as safe as she hopes to be, Sparks expertly amps up the suspense --- turning what has been a pleasant romance into a riveting \\"read all night\\" page-turner. That almost unbearable tension of inevitable impending doom comes to a natural yet unexpected conclusion. While readers are likely to be more than satisfied by the resolution, they have one more unexpected treat on the way (I'm not telling...or even giving hints!).    Nicholas Sparks's bevy of fans will be wowed by SAFE HAVEN. But I also predict this book will attract many new admirers with its crossover into thriller territory.        --- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon

0312600844|4.0|There is a certain amount of hubris involved in titling a novel with a word as capacious and controversial as \\"freedom.\\" Happily, Jonathan Franzen has the ability to produce a work fully worthy of that portentous term. He has done that with integrity, compassion and humor in a story that is as real as your next-door neighbors and as rich with contemporary relevance as tonight's cable news broadcast.    From the outside, it's hard to imagine more conventional archetypes of late 20th-century urban gentry than Patty and Walter Berglund. Married shortly after their graduation from the University of Minnesota, they move into a marginal neighborhood in St. Paul and spend 10 years renovating a Victorian home while raising their two children, Jessica and Joey. Earnest, public-spirited Walter begins his career as an attorney for 3M but quickly deserts the corporate world for the Nature Conservancy. Eventually he lands at the Cerulean Mountain Trust, an organization created by a Texas oil billionaire to preserve 100 square miles of pristine West Virginia mountain land --- the native habitat of the tiny cerulean warbler --- while at the same time denuding 14,000 coal-rich acres nearby through the brutal process of mountaintop removal. Patty, a stay-at-home mother, increasingly is frustrated in that role as the years pass.    A good portion of the story of the Berglunds' troubled marriage is recounted in Patty's therapeutic journal entitled, with rueful understatement, \\"Mistakes Were Made.\\" In place of a conventional first-person narrative, she writes in the voice of someone she calls \\"the autobiographer,\\" telling of her days as a college basketball star (second team All-American after her sophomore year) and sketching the landscape of the tense emotional triangle at the heart of the novel. The third member of that triangle is Richard Katz, a friend of Walter's from their college days and an iconoclastic alt-rocker whose bands (the Traumatics and Walnut Surprise) are the kind with \\"record sales in the low four digits and audiences in the high two digits.\\" Walter, kindhearted and dutiful, is a small planet circling Richard's sun, and while Patty makes what at first seems the safe choice, her inability to shake Richard's gravitational pull enmeshes the threesome in a swirl of emotional and sexual betrayal that Franzen portrays with frightful precision.    Amidst the drama of the Berglunds' fraught but enduring relationship, Franzen roams over a lively assortment of timely issues, from environmental battles to overpopulation, the war in Iraq and the frantic emptiness of our consumer culture, without ever giving the sense he's checking off boxes or resorting to these touchstones merely to invest his story with a feeling of relevance. Like far-off flashes of heat lightning, those elements are present without dominating the central story.    FREEDOM also benefits from Franzen's ability to leaven the unquestionably serious tone of the novel with bursts of wry, even self-deprecating, humor. In one, Walter, who on the surface fits the profile of the quintessential NPR connoisseur, condemns the radio network for \\"deliberately wasting precious minutes of airtime every morning and evening --- minutes that could have been devoted to raising the alarm about overpopulation and mass extinctions --- on famously earnest reviews of literary novels and quirky musical acts like Walnut Surprise.\\" The account of the trip Joey Berglund (who commits the almost unpardonable sin of becoming a Republican) takes to Argentina in the company of his college roommate's voluptuous sister, abandoning her to search out spare parts in Paraguay for obsolete Polish trucks shipped to Iraq on behalf of an unscrupulous military contractor, is an uproarious piece of comic writing.    True to the novel's title, Franzen persistently explores the notion of freedom in a multiplicity of expressions. Whether it's rapacious corporations left unchecked to despoil the environment, the freedom of an immigrant to \\"make the most of his abilities,\\" or the propensity of feral cats to roam the land slaughtering songbirds by the millions, we come to see that freedom, for all the homage we pay to it in America, is far from an unalloyed good. In this land where we live amidst persistent reminders that we are free to reinvent ourselves over and over again, Patty and Walter Berglund's clumsy efforts to do just that are even more poignant.    But given Franzen's obvious ambition, the inevitable question that lingers when one turns the last of FREEDOM's 562 pages is whether this is a novel that will be read a generation or two from now. While it's risky to predict how the winds of literary fashion may blow, Franzen's novel has all the earmarks of a work of enduring merit and significance. Its penetrating examination of our uneasy times is surpassed only by the acuity of his insight into the souls of his troubled creations. In those terms, and apart from the grace and clarity of his prose, it is a novel of consequence and more than fulfills the bold promise of its title. When it ends, you'll be a little wiser about the ways of our world and you will feel as if you know Patty and Walter Berglund, their family and the elusive Richard Katz as well as you know some of your closest friends. Maybe better.        --- Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg

I believe jumping jacks are a great way to workout, but Jillian tends to overdo it a little with them and other jumping exercises and it tends to be hard on the knees.

0385342047|5.0|Two-year-old Minnie is precocious, intelligent, wily --- and a mini shopaholic. A product of her environment, Minnie wants everything she sees and knows what she likes; as long as it has a designer label, it's \\"miiiiine.\\" I invite you to join Sophie Kinsella for the shopping spree of your life.    Minnie has an allowance of 50 pence per week. Remember, she is two years old. Her mother is Becky Brandon, the original dyed-in-the-wool shopaholic, who keeps a diary of her daughter's purchases. Able to borrow against future allowance allotments, Minnie --- by the end of the book --- has spent her allowance until 2013. In one day, she has bought six identical dolls, designer shoes, clothes, and toys with which she will never play. Spoiled? Well, maybe. Nanny Sue to the rescue!    Minnie's christening is an amazing ceremony. She first visits all the guests in their pews and charms the ladies to relinquish their designer handbags. With five of them on her arm, she strolls up to the pulpit and proceeds to empty each one in front of all the guests.    Meanwhile, Becky wants another baby. Just think of the purchasing power another little one would give her: a new pram, baby bedroom furniture, linens, infant clothes...the possibilities are endless. After all, she just found designer clothes on sale for Minnie to wear until she's 21! She definitely needs new shopping territories to conquer.    Luke is Becky's incredibly understanding and forgiving husband. After he questions her about two identical sweaters, each costing 100 pounds, she promises him that she will \\"wear it so many times, it'll totally pay for itself.\\" Luke responds, \\"How many would that be? Twice.\\" The only difference in the two articles of clothing is the placement and color of a button.    When the Bank of London crashes, Becky and her family are forced to control their spending. Becky decides to barter for the services, food and other amenities she needs for Luke's surprise birthday party. She trades her designer bags, clothes, shoes, etc. and receives such items as a tent (complete with black and green mold), a fire eater and canapés. She is so excited about the prospect of bartering that she writes to the Central Monetary Unit for Monetary Policy and advises them to solve the national budgetary crisis by bartering with France for goods and services. This is Becky's way of \\"going green.\\"    Becky visits the Pound Shop, much like our Dollar Stores here in the U.S. Astounded by the bargains, she buys 17 bags of goodies, mostly because everything is a pound. How could she be expected to resist? Having trouble controlling her shopping, she finally elicits the help of her doctor, asking him to issue a prescription to \\"buy a few little things for the sake of her health.\\"    By far the most hysterical part of MINI SHOPAHOLIC is when Becky explains that her Internet shopping spree is due to \\"sleep shopping.\\" Sixteen coats, all the same color and size, arrive, and she even tries to blame the incident on Minnie. This is one of the most entertaining books I have read in years. Sophie Kinsella has the formula for humor down to a science. Despite a three-year gap between Shopaholic novels, she still has the science of shopping in the bag.        --- Reviewed by Marge Fletcher
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I bought this for my fiancee because she loves the show. I think the content is pretty funny too, so when I purchased it I thought I'd be getting the complete series but every disc has at least one episode that doesn't play, and for most of them it's closer to half that are poorly burned. Whoever checked the lot that I received did a really bad job at QA. It's definitely a disc issue because the discs do not play in my five year old dvd player and they do not play in my brand new bluray player either, and when I tried to pop them into my computer's very high end dvd burner drive, they weren't even recognized. I requested a return with Amazon, and will follow up when I get the replacement DVD's. Right now I cannot recommend this product at all because half of the episodes do not play, even though they are burned on mint condition discs.<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD:<br /><br />Same issues with the replacement set. Each disc has at least one episode that just doesn't play, and usually half. My girl likes the box set though so I'm probably just going to eat the difference and buy each season seperately, and put them in this box.<br /><br />RELATED NOTE:<br />Amazon's return policy made this really fast and relatively painless. The problem here is with whoever they sourced the discs from. They weren't burned correctly. I'll still shop at Amazon, they are awesome.

0385473788|5.0|The words and thoughts of Anne, are quite unique...inspiring, heart felt , open, spontaneous, down to earth. you can actually invision and feel a-lot about her personal thoughts and struggles, as she was recounting her childhood and then the experiences she was going through in hiding. she had many mixed feelings and hopes for the future, as she tells them, and at times there are funny parts in the book. she was several years ahead of her time and very perceptive and was able to express her thoughts very well. after checking the book out from the library I then had to find this definative edition for my own. if you are a sentimental type, and appreciate truly down to earth reading, annes pen as well, in some parts of the book was actually poetic as well. this is a collectors edition.
0689870272|5.0|Quick book that shows what sounds different animals make. My 13 month old son likes to look at the pictures and point to the animals while I imitate the noises they make. I think this will keep us entertained for a while to come especially when he can start imitating the noises too. Cute book.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|I worked in the television industry for 20 years as a creative executive.  Damages is the best series produced in the past decade, and maybe one of the top 10 series of all time.  I am shocked that FX did not pick it up for another season.  What a loss.
0807014273|5.0|Fast Delivery and the book was in great condition. Would definitely buy from in the future.
B000B8QG4A|1.0|This was a 2 DVD set, advertised as used, but new condition.  The bonus DVD was cracked and the DVD of the movie was scratched and skipped and stuck..my daughter was very disappointed that she did not get to watch Lady and the Tramp.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|If you're looking for vintage Led Zeppelin, you won't find it here.  With Band of Joy, Robert Plant has settled into a softer, more controlled sound. (Though we do get an occasional taste of his trademark wail.) I was fortunate to see Plant on his recent tour and, whether doing rock, blues, folk or some combination of all, he will always hold rock god status for me.
B001ROAK9E|1.0|The book is 2x more expensive in digital form than in book version?    Ridiculous!
B000BGR0OM|1.0|I was watching MTV the other day and felt so blessed to be around in 2010 because how wonderful music is now!  It's so sad to know that back in the 80s they had to tolerate this junk! Songs like \\"sweet dreams\\" and \\"here comes the rain again\\" are perfect examples of how terrible these musicians were and how bad 80s music is!! Why arent there lyrics about pimpz, hoez, or rimz!?!? Why doesn't the singer get caught lip syncing or get thrown in jail for being a drug addict!?!?  This isn't real music!!    For good music check out Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, LA ROUX and LADY GAGA!
B001V7UXG2|5.0|The Jeeves & Wooster book series written by PG Wodehouse is one of the greatest piece of humorous or otherwise literary work ever. As compared to the TV series the books, of course, tend to provide a deeper perspective in Bertie Wooster's mind, but I had to see it in order to visualize that day & age which Hugh Laurie & Stephen Fry take to visual perfection. . A second and no less reason why I got the DVD set is because they hardly show it on TV anymore.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin,  professor, renowned consultant to the beef industry, and author, could not even speak a word until she turned four years old. Her mother had the great misfortune, not of suffering because of a \\"disabled\\" child, but of suffering through medical and \\"mental health\\" professionals with wrong-headed and blaming attitudes.  TG was born in 1950, and the prevailing professional attitude of the times was that the affliction of autism was caused by \\"cold, non-nurturing  mothers\\" who fail to bond with the child.  A child diagnosed as autistic (called \\"infantile schizophrenia\\" in those days!) was thought to be \\"hopeless\\"; and the best solution was believed to be to institutionalize and forget about the child. Well, fortunately for Temple and the rest of the world, her mother KNEW that she did not cause her daughter's autism, and furthermore, she knew that her daughter was bright. Just how bright she was would be revealed as Temple's mom pushed her to learn and to go beyond her comfort zone, and, as the film has it, she learned to think, \\"It's just another door. I can go through it.\\"    The film focuses quite a bit on Temple's school years, through the private boarding school in NH (where her science teacher becomes her advocate and mentor), to her victory in graduating from college (after seriously resisting attending), on to get a master's in animal science from Arizona State U. (where it is so hot that she couldn't believe that people live there!), and beyond. Obviously Temple does learn to talk and to function in the world of people, but she is still more at home in the world of animals. She bonds with the horses at her private school, and then goes on to focus on cattle (her favorite animal) and the humane treatment of beef cattle.     Much of the film focuses on her development of a \\"squeeze machine\\"; a self-comforting devise she designs after she saw how cattle calmed down when herded into a mechanism that encloses the cow into a mechanical holding devise. Autistic people are normally unable to tolerate human touch, and have sensory issues in general.  But TG is impressed by the calming effect of the simple machine, she goes on to construct her personal \\"hug machine\\".  It turns out to be quite an uphill battle to get the authorities at school to let her keep one in her room.      The movie shows how, despite the extreme social difficulties of high school, and TG's love of living and working at her aunt's ranch--and sameness in general--her mother helps her see going forward to college and beyond as \\"just another door to go through.\\"  In this manner, she imagines each major step literally as a door she could walk through, and she manages to do so.    I really enjoyed this movie, and not only is it a great introduction to Temple Grandin and her work, but I think it is a profound statement about the value of the individual who is \\"different\\".
B003DKJ5ZU|4.0|My 2.5 year old can't get enough of it. Great music, great story, great lessons, great animation. Doesn't have villons dying at the end or other ultra scary scenes for us to fast forward. A winner in our house!
0143118420|2.0|I'm having a hard time getting through this book. I think that's because the book is about four years old and what was new and interesting in 2006 just isn't that exciting in 2010. I've read too many blogs that read like this and I don't find her ideas, thoughts and feelings all that profound. Maybe the movie is better, but the reviews said otherwise. Save your money, read something else.
0061537969|5.0|Excellent book excellent condition fast service! A+ A wonderful story. Funny, sad, yet hopeful and well written. A great buy for any pet lover!
B0018AOAOI|5.0|An album that stands apart from all others, a dark and mesmerizing masterpiece. I'll always wonder where the band's unique sound and momentum would have taken them if they hadn't broken up after the first Lollapalooza.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Love it!!  I can honestly say that I love every song and have been listening to it every chance I get.
B003F3NDP8|4.0|**NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br /><br />When viewers last left Wisteria Lane at the end of Season Five of \\"Desperate Housewives\\", a new family was moving into the neighborhood.<br /><br />Drea de Matteo (\\"The Sopranos\\") plays the new housewife on the Lane. Angie Bolen is a brash Italian New Yorker who brings with her to the suburbs her twitchy husband Nick and son Danny. What would new residents be without some dark secret? Well, it seems Angie and her two men are hiding out from the Feds because of some terrorist activity in their past.<br /><br />The Bolen clan's arrival coincides with a rash of stranglings in Fairview, and the most recent young female victim is Susan's daughter Julie Mayer!<br /><br />At first I didn't care for the Angie character, but when things start really cooking in the second half of the season, I was really rooting for her and was sorry she won't be back next season.<br /><br />It was great to see Angie bail Bree out of a jam, TWICE this season. Another fun moment occurs when Angie gets some news about the person blackmailing her. That slight grin of satisfaction in the hospital was priceless!<br /><br />It was a welcome change to have de Matteo replace Nicollette Sheridan, because I felt Edie's slutty ways were getting old.<br /><br />Speaking of old, as the season began I was praying it was NOT Susan under that bridal veil. For some reason the writers seem to think all viewers want to see is she and Mike. I wish the pair of them had been written out of the show along with Edie. I was sick of their on-and-off again romance by the end of Season Three.<br /><br />Although I wasn't thrilled with the reunion of Susan and Mike, the good thing that comes of that is that Dana Delany finally gets some decent material to work with after a dull Season Five. It was interesting to see Catherine slowly unravel and I kept wishing she'd have more screen time. The developments with Julie Benz' character Robin were a welcome surprise.<br /><br />The season definitely got better as it went along and the many plot threads began to connect.<br /><br />As always, Bree and Lynette get the most interesting storylines. Gabby didn't annoy me this season as much as she has in the past. She was crucial in the outcome of the Bolen storyline, which took a very interesting turn at the last moment. I loved it!<br /><br />The Xmas episode is this season's attempt at the annual \\"disaster/crisis\\" episode. This year we get a plane crash. Of course, the best part about these almost-annual \\"disaster\\" episodes is how it changes the course of the plot and the after-effects on certain characters, and this season is no exception. I particularly liked how it got Angie off the hook with her blackmailer and put Lynette back in Gabby and Carlos' good graces.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of this show is the fantastic casting of the female guest stars. Past seasons have included turns by great ladies of Hollywood's past (Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin, Polly Bergin), amazing talent from other TV classics (Dixie Carter, Laurie Metcalf, Frances Conroy) and underused or forgotten gems (Celia Weston, Lesley Boone, Valerie Mahaffey). Though there was less of it this year, in the finale we get an unrecognizable Patty McCormack (\\"The Bad Seed\\") looking uncannily like Louise Latham.<br /><br />We get to see what the child actors who originally played the Scavo boys during Seasons 1-4 look like now during a brief clip and another former resident of Wisteria Lane makes a surprise return in the finale.<br /><br />I didn't care for the unneccesary overuse use of the \\"P\\" word every time a character expressed how angry they were. Writers, please keep it clean--this isn't a cable show. While that kind of language is becoming more prevalent in society, the show would be much classier without it.<br /><br />Though it took a while to get things cooking, this season was much better than Season 5. The last four episodes are amazing, once the strangler is revealed (he reminds me of a young Alice Cooper).<br /><br />The bonus features include the usual bloopers, some short interviews with Marc Cherry, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman and Doug Savant, about a half-dozen deleted scenes, and Cherry's commentary on his favorite scenes this season.er is revealed (he reminds me of a young Alice Cooper).<br /><br />The bonus features include the usual bloopers, some short interviews with Marc Cherry, Marcia Cross, Felicity Huffman and Doug Savant, about a half-dozen deleted scenes, and Cherry's commentary on his favorite scenes this season.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|What can I say that has not already been written?  Spoiler alert!!!The characters are dead either because they died in the plane crash in season one or in season 6.  The writers/producers of Lost played a long con on the audience.  They created mystery after mystery to maintain ratings, but they never had intention of resolving the mysteries.  If they had wanted to resolve the mysteries. they would have written the solution to the mystery at the same time as they introduced the mystery into the plot.  What murder mystery ends without the murderer being known?<br /><br />But even if you completely disagree with my viewpoint and liked the show including season 6, wait to buy season 6.  Prices goes down not up.  On September 12, Lost was at #31 in 19 days of release.  Two days later on September 14, Amazon ran a one day in which you could purchase season for around 425.<br /><br />Thus I would advise you to wait for the after Christmas sale to buy this disk.  Also you could try out Ebay for better prices on season 6.<br /><br />I do not think you should buy season 6.  but if you do, but it at the lowest possible price.
B000002I8D|3.0|This album was expected to be good, but it failed to tickle my fancy all the way. The first song was pretty good; everyone knows it. \\"This Must Be Love\\" is a sweet melody that I didn't like too much. \\"Behind The Lines\\" sounds pretty good. Unfortunately, for some reason, you don't get the lyrics for this track as you do for most of the songs in the album's booklet. I did not like, \\"The Roof is Leaking,\\" as it dealt with too much complaining. The next to tracks are interesting instrumentals that require a bit of patience. \\"I Missed Again,\\" the second hit from this CD, sounds pretty good; it's about flirting and wondering whether or not you blew your chances with trying to get with somebody. \\"You Know What I Mean\\" is a slow but short song without a rhythm and it fails to exploit Collin's high voice; it's not affectionate enough. \\"Thunder and Lightning\\" sounds good; it's upbeat. \\"I'm Not Moving\\" shows Phil's stubborn side and it too is upbeat. The last two tracks I wouldn't bother listening to.
0618680004|1.0|Let me start by saying that I am an atheist. I was looking forward to reading this book. However, I am having a difficult time getting through the first half of it.     While I agree with a lot of what the author states, his presentation is lacking. The text is often rambling. Also, the author bashes believers, which I find unnecessary. One can present arguments and facts without attacking the opposing viewpoint.
0345505387|5.0|While the book wasn't exactly what I had expected (having never read a graphic novel before), I loved it. The artwork was amazing! It was great to see Outlander from another point of view, and I think Diana did a fantastic job!
030745455X|5.0|This book was as good as the one before it! I recommend this book! It's worth your time and money!!
B003PIUC02|2.0|I have talked with several others who have purchased the Blueray version of Spartacus:Blood and Sand, and literally ALL OF THEM, have said they have received anywhere from 2-4 of the discs in the set being horribly scuffed with abrasions all over the discs because of the way the discs were packaged(not on plastic spindels, but stuffed inside paper/cardboard sleeves).Even with the protective coating on the Blueray discs,3 of the 4 discs in my set were scratched and scuffed.I don't know who designed the packaging for this set, but it's extremely disappointing that the packaging was designed so poorly(and cheaply), that it has resulted in just about every set having damaged discs included.I am returning mine to Amazon, and don't want another because it to will certainly include damaged discs, and i work too hard for my money to spend it on substandard items such as this.I'll likely opt for the streaming HD version, and may reconsider picking up the Blueray edition if Starz/Anchor Bay every releases updated packaging that will not damage the included discs.    I HIGHLY reccommend others who receive sets like this, return them, and express their disappointment.It's shocking that a $55 blueray set is being sold like this(at all retailers carrying it, not only Amazon), and it should not be tolerated.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|When season two started on FX we had seen the previews and were intrigued. After just one episode of season 2 we decided to buy season 1, watch it, and then get back into season 2. We usually don't buy TV series on DVD, but this series is amazing and a must have. So we bought season 2 as soon as it came out. Now we are enjoying season 3 every Tuesday evening. The story line is intriguing and the characters are so much fun to watch. Every episode provides a thrill. The Sons are a blast and should have been nominated for Emmys.
B003QCCS36|4.0|Great new album! I am very pleased with Ray's latest and love the Pariah Dogs. Wasn't sure what to think when I heard of the new band, but they definitely made a positive impression on me. I saw them live in Vegas, too, and they rocked. I've seen almost every US tour of Ray's and the band definitely completes his act. If you like Ray's smokey sound, you will enjoy God Willing. It will not disappoint.
B00004XOWM|2.0|This record is a \\"like new record\\" and shouldnt be scratchet, im so desapointed becouse that track is the best in the album!
1601251556|5.0|I'm finding it hard to believe there is anyone who could rate these flipmats at anything less than 5-stars.     Seriously, this is the best value in gaming supplies out there. I have three of them, they fold up nicely, and with some wear, they always lay flat. They are made of card-stock paper, not thick cardboard, which some people seemed surprised at, but I wouldn't personally be interested in carrying around a heavy thick folded up stack of cardboard. Once these have been used a few times, folded in various ways, they lay perfectly flat.      They hold up well, they don't stain from the ink or dry or wet erase markers. I don't bother with tiles or anything besides these now, nor do I ever bring out my old Chessex vinyl mat (which is permanently ruined by dry-erase markers).     These flipmats are reliable and hardy, I can't remember what we used for game maps before these.
0312600844|1.0|Very disappointed in this book.  I did not enjoy Franzen's writing style.  The story is about a family that is in turmoil, but there are pages and pages and pages of useless information.  I never skim, and I found myself skipping trying to keep the story going.    What drove me crazy is how shady and spineless all the characters are.  If some of them could have made a life decision and lived with it instead of obsessing over it throughout this 25yr marriage maybe I would have liked this better.    I was duped by Oprah.  Don't fall for it.  Your life is fine without this book.
B003ESOIGC|5.0|I had seen this movie in my local neighborhood theater and absolutely loved it. Somewhere I saw it billed/advertised as the new Mary Poppins,.I had to add this movie to my film library. It is hysterially funny. \\"Nanny\\" appears uninvited with a peculiar facial appearance which could be slightly frightening to small children.She has a cane that sends fireworks and \\"sparklely\\" lights when it smacks the floor to emphasize a point. Her purpose is to \\"take\\" unruly children and teach them 5 lessons (in her own inimitable fashion). As they learn each one, OOPSY-DAISY, I don't want to give away the fun. This movie is an absolute must see and I look forward to seeing the sequel.
B003WSFXKY|1.0|This is not Santana or in any way reminiscent of any of his previous albums...as simple as that. Junk from start to finish.
B002MU4NLI|5.0|My wife had been looking for this movie, in general, for quite sometime. Searching on Amazon and finding a few different versions, I ran accross this nice double-disc version that not only contained an updated color version, but the original black-and-white as well. The item came rather quickly in the mail, in great protective packaging, and my wife's eyes lit up once she had opened it! And to put the cherry on top of the sundae, it came with a little collectors Christmas ornament, which my wife loves to collect during the season. The version was literally \\"the whole package\\" for any fan of the movie! It even includes original trailers and behind the scenes footage. Great stuff!
B003TXKSWK|5.0|John Legend and the Roots killed it on this one! they really brought it back to like the 70's style funk like pimp musik. I have had it spinning in the CD player for three days now. Its nice to have music that I can play and enjoy that does not burn my kids ears with cussing (like all my other music).
0786886811|5.0|After reading the reviews I bought the UK version more than a year ago. Since then I have made a lot of recipes from this book, and I'm looking forward to making more in the future. In \\"How to Be a Domestic Goddess\\" Nigella Lawson describes her recipes so well that every time I pick a recipe to make I know for sure that it will come out delicious. And there are so many to choose from: from \\"cooking for the school fête\\" to Christmas recipes and \\"the domestic goddess' pantry,\\" this book includes both classic and original deserts. When I make something (that is anything) from this book, everyone who eats it wants the recipe, it's guaranteed! So far the favorites are espresso and walnut cookies, Coca Cola cake, cream cheese brownies, and banana bread. And recipes are relatively easy to make, ingredients don't cost that much and you probably already own all the equipment you need. Nigella's introductions to each recipe are wonderful and it's like she gives you confidence to attempt each recipe and execute it well. I think one review said she was nicely bossy, and I couldn't agree more.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|I am a 51 year old man, who, enjoys a good show.  I only listened to this album to make sure that my 15 year old isn't being \\"corrupted.\\"  Sure, there are some bad words.  But, guess what he will get over it.  I am not sure that the people who idolized and grew up with Linkin Park will get over their disappointment that \\"this is not their sound.\\"  As someone who had not heard one word from Linkin Park before this album, my take is that this is some exceptional stuff--stuff that has the potential to last as long as U-2's the Joshua Tree.  Melodies and hooks with some thought, and some beat.  Buy it, listen to it with an open mind, you just might like it.
0679420266|5.0|The book came in a reasonable amount of time, in perfect condition and no issues. I will use this seller again!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise from Disney. The story is simple enough for children to follow, but poignant and weighty enough for adults to walk away moved. Michael Giacchino is beautiful. Buy this movie.
0345505387|4.0|I really enjoyed the new storyline and the artwork.  I have never read a graphic novel but thought that it was well done.  I am so glad that I bought it for my collection of Diana's work.  I also thought the illustrator paid close attention to the details of the characters and was surprised that this was his first graphic novel.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I loved this a child. I saw it recently and remembered why. The music is wonderful. The story is enchanting. I can't wait to see it on blu-ray.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I loved it! A great action film with a wonderful story-line. Angelina is a super actress weather it.s action or drama! I went on my birthday and would go see it again.

B000K4X5XA|5.0|Will a box set of all the superman movies be coming out on blu ray? I would like to get at least superman the movie and both versions of superman 2, superman 3, 4 and superman returns.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|By now you have no doubt read all the comments stating that Russell Crowe is too old and fat to be Robin Hood and Cate Blanchett mis-cast as a middle-aged Maid Marion.  For those that are bothered by such things as this, I suppose these are valid reasons to criticize the movie.  On the other hand, if you are a movie viewer whose main incentive to attend any movie is to see a good tale, well told, then this movie is for you. It is a wonderful story best described as a prologue to the legend that we know so well. It takes nothing away from the legend but adds much.  Ridley Scott produces marvelous images. His films are always visually arresting.  \\"Robin Hood\\" is full of beautiful scenes and even the brutal battle segments are eye candy.  There is not a poorly acted character in the movie.  Crowe and Blanchett are superb in their parts and Oscar Isaac is a truly nefarious and duplicitous King John.  For those that complain about the length, I can only say that their attention span must be compromised.  I was sorry the film ended as it kept me enthralled for the entire run time.  Highly recommended.
B0040T7CFS|5.0|Just a warning, this is done on all period instruments. If you really prefer the sound of a piano to a harpsichord [I can go with either one, myself] then don't go with this box.    It comes in a very nice, fairly attractive cardboard box with a table of contents on the inside lid. The CDs are in durable paper covers with track-lists on the back along with performance information. The sections [Orchestral, Keyboard, Vocal, Cantatas, Organ, and DVD] are color coded, which is helpful.     Thankfully for me, all of my CDs are fully-functioning. I had heard some horror stories about CDs not working, but no such thing happened to me. The DVD title lists are a bit slow-moving for me on my computer, but surely that will be different in a DVD player. Also, there is one CD [no.134: Magnificat in D and Chorales] which does not load track information on my computer, but it plays just fine in iTunes [Windows Media Player would not play the last track.] Despite any flaws in a single CD, at less than a dollar per CD, you could easily use your savings [over a hundred dollars, compared to the Hanssler edition which is coming out soon] to replace it.     I highly suggest buying -this- edition to any true Bach lover, it's lovely, affordable, and, for the most part, immaculate.
B003ITZBVS|4.0|An interesting look at one of Batman's biggest failures coming back to haunt him.  Action sequences are lively enough for animation and the voices are mostly on spot.  There's a few good jokes by the Joker and Batman is his usual grim self.  I can't really say more without spoilers but check this out if you're a Batman fan.  Probably one of the better tale on DVD.
B003V5PPZG|4.0|I can't believe all these negative reviews for this album. People giving it 1 star and saying the MTM is a better album???? MTM was shameful pop punk disgrace. It was change but in a really bad way.   This album is not as good as Hybrid Theory, definitely not as good as HT EP. But it is so much better than MTM and rivals Meteora.     This album can be a little pretentious (ie the band's foreward) It certainly is not a revolutionary or innovative album that they claim it to be. The audio clips sometimes sounded too forced, too much of an attempt to elevate the music in making a commentary about the ills of society. It felt a little formulaic after a while. True, it doesn't have much layered guitar but honestly, I never thought that that was a winning point for Linkin Park. They were never really good instrumentalist to begin with.     This album was mature, outside of the linkin park box, and worthy of a 4 in my book. It brought to the front the electronic components of linkin park that we had glimpses of in points of authority, session and reanimation tracks in an industrial/prog rock reminiscent of Nine Inch Nails. And honestly, how can you discount the album after listening to blackout.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|Even though he is gone his music still prevails and brings back memories. There will never be another Isacc Hayes.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|If you're reading this review, it probably means you didn't see the movie in the theater. I saw it several times, at least once in IMAX, and I was genuinely concerned that a smaller screen could never do the movie justice.    Hard to believe, but there is a whole group of people out there that absolutely hate super-hero movies. That's because super-heroes don't do a very good job representing us. We have a hard time seeing ourselves in the super-hero's shoes, because they're so much larger than life.     On the contrary, Tony Stark is someone that a guy like me can easily relate to. No, I'm not a multi-billionaire or the son of an iconic genius-inventor / modern renaissance man.     Tony Stark is a man. He's an alcoholic, and a womanizer, and he knows that money can't buy happiness. He's a charismatic leader that can charm an audience with his wit and humor, and he has developed a track record for being a hero with which no villain should even attempt to challenge. He's an athlete, and a fighter, and he has gone toe-to-toe with all manner of villains already (none of whom we get to know anything about--we just have to assume.)    Don Cheadle gives a very understated performance, but he plays the part well. I do appreciate the fact that he's a serious hero that kids will love, and he also happens to be African-American (something that's not usually true of super-heroes.) War Machine is a force to be reckoned with, and Don Cheadle does a great job exhibiting the type of maschismo that would go hand-in-hand with suiting up in armor that makes one a virtual one man army.    ScarJo also does a great job...But no one would have cared no matter how bad her acting proved to be. She's Eye Candy at it's very finest, and watching her in her form-fitting outfits is something akin to staring at the sun during an eclipse. I'm serious: she's so smoking hot, I couldn't figure out why Tony wasn't trying to put the moves on her. There's a scene on the night of his birthday party, when he's clearly getting drunk, and I suppose a lesser man would have been all over her. Not Tony, though. It's clear that he's already made his choice: Miss Pepper Potts.     The movie has its flaws, and it has its fair share of detractors. Critics that I trust implicitly have stated unequivocably that they loathed the movie, which really hurts my heart. I loved this movie, and I intend to find out how many viewings I can get out of a Blu-Ray before it has to be replaced.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|If the HBO film, \\"Temple Grandin\\", had simply been about a woman dealing with her autism during a time when the condition wasn't understood very well, this would have been a compelling story.  Likewise, if the movie had simply been about a woman trying to break into the heavily male-dominated cattle industry in the 1970's and 80's, that would have been compelling, too.  Amazingly, though, the movie is about both of these things, making it especially rich and interesting.<br /><br />Everyone in the film is great, but Claire Danes as Temple is particularly excellent, delivering a strong, detailed portrayal, but never overplaying or letting the performance drift over into mere mimicry.  Also pleasures are the fine, understated performances of Julia Ormond, Catherine O'Hara, and David Strathairn, as Temple's mother, aunt, and a favorite teacher.<br /><br />\\"Temple Grandin\\" looks sharp and clean on the standard DVD I watched.  There's a short but interesting \\"making of\\" piece on the DVD, too, as well as a commentary track.  Both feature the real-life Temple Grandin, who's still an active force on the world stage.<br /><br />Give this one a whirl if you want both your head and your heart stimulated.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|Ok, first things. Lets forget about the first few complete brainless morons who \\"rated\\" this product without ever seeing it and well before it was released. Total idiots. If you haven't seen something, DON'T come on here and rate it. Whether its available on blu-ray or not is irrelevant for rating the goods.  Now...to the DVD. I was anticipating this and had checked some clips from the show on YouTube. It really shows the poor quality video/audio recordings people upload there. I was a bit skeptical but when it came in the mail a couple days ago, i threw it in and WOW. What a show. Nice setlist and the video and audio quality is superb. Great stage show and presence as well. Another great live DVD from the Slipknot guys. I'll definitely watch this plenty of times. HIGHLY recommended.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I've loved Iron Man ever since my first Tales of Suspense comic, so I might not be the most unbiased person to write a review.  Still, I'm going to try and be as honest as I possibly can.  In some ways, Iron Man 2 improves on the original.  For instance, the brawl between Iron Man and War Machine was perfect, and RDJr was even better this time around.  However, there were some weak moments.  For example, Pepper Potts is almost absent from the movie, and is shrill and unpleasant during her brief appearances. Whiplash has never been a particularly compelling villain, and the movie doesn't do much to make him any more exciting.  Also, they really need to STOP with the \\"Iron Man fights someone who has the same technology\\" plots.  It's already boring.  Plus, I couldn't help but wonder where a drunken hobo managed to get the equipment to build an Arc Reactor. Stark did it in the first movie because he had several billion dollars worth of his own weaponry to cannibalize. How does a homeless Russian manage it?  Furthermore, the character of Justin Hammer was silly and played for laughs, which was the wrong move.  It had a real \\"Jim Carrey in Batman Forever\\" vibe to it.      Others have mentioned the unnecessary plot lines, and they're right.  We could have done entirely without the \\"Paladium Poisoning\\" and the \\"Under House Arrest by SHIELD\\" plots, since neither of them really went anywhere, and felt like padding in a movie that didn't need any.  I didn't mind the Black Widow showing up, but eventually it felt like we were tripping over minor characters.  Also, they're not fooling anyone with the whole \\"The Avengers don't want Tony Stark\\" subplot.  None of us believe for a moment that they'd do an Avengers movie without the only Avenger that's proven to be a box-office success.    Still, it was a good movie.  Perhaps not a GREAT movie like the first one, but at least it wasn't a franchise-killing fiasco like Spiderman 3 or Batman and Robin.  Honestly, if none of us had everseen the original Iron Man, we'd all be talking about how this movie was one of the best Comic Book movies ever.  But as it is, it's over-shadowed by it's phenomenal predecessor.
0312600844|4.0|These characters, except one, are so very real.  It is really surprising how well Franzen did with every character.     At least that was how I felt in the middle of the book.  But, after a bit of reflection, some of the situations the characters are placed in are rather unbelievable.    One element of the story is that Patty's family is very, very wealthy. And then Patty's son, at age 19, receives an $800,000 contract to supply spare parts for military vehicles in Iraq. And of course, Patty's son falls for a gorgeous women that is astonishingly rich and invites him to Argentina for a horseback riding vacation after his business trip to Poland. Yeah, right!     One or two of these elements I might understand. but this story is littered with them.  It starts to feel rather soap opera-ish. Maybe this book should have been in the fantasy section along with Piers Anthony and JRR Tolkien.    Some of this stuff is quite believable.  For example, Patty's obsessive college friend and the relationship is believable--the power of denial is really quite amazing. And so is Patty's relationship with Katz. I've known women that have done the same thing.    Disappointing was the character development of Lalitha. A 27 year old idealist falling for a much older, educated, married man is not surprising. But what was she thinking?  Why did an intelligent women with such a positive, glowing personality not have any other friends? What was she thinking in falling for a guy that was also her boss?     Lalitha attitude and background should have been developed and explored. She could have been really quite interesting. Yet she was introduced primarily to be Walter's love and sexual interest.    Franzen did a good job.  The plot moved quite nicely, especially for the length of this book.  But alas, it is not the masterpiece that many others think it is.  There are too many \\"yeah, right!\\" plot elements and at least one character, Lalitha, is dropped into the plot simply as a one dimensionalcharacter and not much more.
0393068382|5.0|An easy read backed up with lots of sound academic references.  As someone who has rejected stereotypes and believed in equality for many years, done academic research and been a single parent male 'mother' to my daughter (now 14) since she was a few days old, I found Cordelia Fine's book really struck a chord with me.  It seemed to explain and endorse so much of what I've done in life.
B003WTO5XY|4.0|The legendary CARRIE in High-Definition! This classic Cinderella story with a dark, supernatural twist to it has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it. It has it all: An emotionally-driven story (unlike most horror films) that takes you to highs, lows, and everything in between, mesmorizing performances by the charismatic Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie, and artistic cinematography by director Brian DePalma. It is surely the Ultimate Revenge film with exceptional acting and craftsmanship that puts our more modern movies to shame.    **Video and Audio Quality**       To keep it plain and simple: Carrie on DVD looks more like VHS quality, and Carrie on Blu-Ray looks more like DVD quality. So it never reaches the crisp, crystal clear look of today's Blu-Ray releases, but it is definitely cleaner and finer quality than the DVD. So if you want the best Carrie experience then watch it on Blu-Ray!    **Special Features**      The Blu-Ray disc contains only the theatrical trailer. The DVD, however, is loaded with interviews by all the main cast members, director Brian DePalma, and others who worked on the film. There's a lot to learn from watching the interviews, including the conflicts and challenges they all underwent to make the film, a behind-the-scenes look on the special effects, and a deleted scene that was to be the prologue of the movie. There's also a photogallery and comparison between Stephen King's version of Carrie and Brian DePalma's version of Carrie, plus more.    **The Combo Pack**      It would have been better for everyone had they included the DVD special features on the Blu-Ray disc, but having it all on a combo pack is the next best thing, so if you're a Carrie fan or just love a beautifully crafted classical tale, this is a must have! Own this unforgettable drama/horror movie on Blu-Ray + DVD Combo Pack today!
0740748475|5.0|Calvin and Hobbes was probably the finest comic \\"strip\\" - as opposed to \\"panel\\", taken out by the Far Side - of the 80's and 90's.  Calvin is always 6 years old, with his constant companion the stuffed tiger Hobbes.  This is always funny, often satirical, and will take you back to childhood when you read it.<br /><br />The collection is a huge 3-volume set which comes in a box.  The quality of the materials - at least in my copy - is excellent.  There is an introduction and notes, and then the entire run of Calvin strips over its too-short 15 year life.  It is best read on a table or on the floor - each volume is simply too big and heavy to hold in your hands.<br /><br />Yes, this is an expensive book, but it is an absolute bargain for the price.  The pleasure will remain long after the pain of the price is forgotten.
0452287022|5.0|The beauty of this book is its story-telling style and the in the manner of detail in its depiction of seventeenth century Dutch life.  Although I watched the movie long ago, my review does not reflect my movie experience. The book did not try to be either authoritative or condescending. Very simply told, and as another reviewer mentioned, with precision.  One reviewer complained about the perfection of the girl Griet. Well, she is telling stories in her own words, and she is after all a maid. So, she can brag about her own maid-works a bit. However, the maturity she displayed has its source in core humanness of all human beings. So, her being intelligent and sensitive should not be considered inappropriate--despite her being a maid. Although its style does not follow the tradition of magic realism, it did have few magical elements, which can be appreciated through the artistic backdrop of the whole story. What we read was not exactly a life-story, rather story of an artwork. I recommend it.

0345505387|4.0|I have a few questions for the people that didn't know what they were buying:    1) When has Dr. Gabaldon EVER written a novel under 700+ pages?  And you thought this was the next installment of the series?  I'm sure that Book 8 will be at least 900 pages.  Lord John books (DG's short stories) run around 300 pages or more.    2) As mentioned in other reviews, \\"Graphic Novel\\" is in the title - and you are surprised it is a \\"comic book\\"?  What part of \\"Graphic Novel\\" is so difficult to understand?    3) It's a little scary that people get on the internet and blindly purchase things and don't know what it is they are purchasing.  I guess that's one of the reasons the internet is a great place for scammers...    As far as reviewing the book itself - it was an interesting read.  I do wish it had been a little longer - I would have liked to see Lallybroch, Jenny, & Ian.  Well, we see Jenny in Jamie's thoughts, but it's not the same.  But maybe there will be one for DIA.  I went into this book knowing that it was a collaboration.  I had seen pages posted on DG's website.  The artist doesn't have a window into DG's mind, so he can not make the characters look exactly like she sees them.  If you read the back of the book, \\"The Making of...\\" section, she explains quite clearly all of the impossibles when doing a graphic novel on long established characters.    I enjoyed the story from different characters' perspectives.  I enjoyed the artwork - there are some I'd love to put on my living room wall, and 1 or 2 that would work in the bedroom.  ;-)

0312600844|5.0|I want to begin this review by putting to rest the perennial questions of whether Franzen is \\"the new Philip Roth\\" and whether this is \\"the next great American novel.\\" My answers are: no he isn't and no it isn't. This is a very good book, I have enjoyed it thoroughly. This is one of those books that preclude you from doing anything else until you finish it. It is, however, not a work of art. It is great entertainment that has nothing to do with literature. Now, whenever I say things like that, people interpret them as an attempt to denigrate a novel. They believe that entertainment is some kind of a lower-quality art. This cannot be further from the truth. Art and entertainment are things of a completely different order, like a star and a steak, a river and a song. They cannot be placed into the hierarchy of better vs worse because they don't belong in the same category of phenomena and do not serve the same purpose.<br /><br />There are two main characteristics that place FREEDOM into the category of entertainment rather than art. One is the author's use of artistic means, in this case, the language. Franzen has an unfortunate tendency to find a cliche he really likes and then reiterate it to death. To give an example, he comes up (pun intended) with the following metaphor that has been done to death long before Franzen chanced upon it: \\"His prophetic dick, his divining rod.\\" Then, the author keeps returning to this tired image, as if he feared that the readers missed it the first 15 times he brought it up (pun intended, once again.) Even if he were the first writer ever to create this metaphor (which he is not by far), this insistence on such a clumsy image is similar to Dr. Phil's repeated use of his trademark cliches. Franzen also has trouble avoiding pomposity. The narrative flow of FREEDOM is often interrupted by statements whose grandiloquence is completely out of sync with the tone of the scene.<br /><br />In spite of these verbal infelicities and Franzen's unfortunate tendency to over-explain every tiny little point he is trying to make, this novel is really great entertainment. The main goal of FREEDOM is to make fun of a certain brand of pseudo progressives who proclaim their allegiance to liberal causes on every corner for the simple reason that this allows them to lead their very conservative lifestyles. Franzen's rabid criticisms of the Democrats don't mean, however, that he is in thrall to the Republicans. In Franzen's world, being a Republican means being so pathetic, ridiculous and stupid, that there is hardly even any need to discuss such blighted existences. The saddest thing for him is that the Republicans have colonized the political discourse in this country to the degree where nothing of substance is left of the Democratic agenda. The main issue that FREEDOM discusses is whether it is possible to uphold progressive values in any significant way in a society where an ultra-conservative discourse has won such a resounding victory.<br /><br />One of the main theme of the novel is ecology. Its main characters are preoccupied with the ongoing ecological meltdown and pretend to work to diminish its effects. However, their ecological blabber conceals a strong desire to practice very traditional lifestyles under the guise of being hardcore progressives. Preoccupation with ecology are, in their case, a perfect excuse for participating even more fully in consumer culture. Their carefully practiced political correctness is a way of signalling their high social status. Walter, the main character of the novel, is the epitome of pseudo-progressive hypocrisy. The cause that is nearest and dearest to his heart is that of curtailing the population growth. he believes that if the world population keeps growing at the current rate, an ecological catastrophe awaits us. Of course, as usually happens in such cases, Walter is so worried about over-population because he has very personal reasons to do so. Reasons, one might add, that are as un-progressive as possible. All this advocate of curbing population growth really wants is to have yet another baby with an Indian woman half his age.<br /><br />The problems that plague the characters of Franzen's novel are caused by nothing other than their incapacity to give up un the patriarchal model of existence. Here again we see such staples of American literature as a perennially depressed, sexually unsatisfied housewife who has antagonized her children by her neediness, a middle-aged man who is incapable of bringing his pseudo-progressive agenda in touch with his desire to be a patriarch, and their children who are crippled by their parents' neuroses. The novel is hilarious (albeit extremely repetitive) and I definitely recommend it.essive as possible.

B00003JRCQ|1.0|Did anyone else find the movie hard to watch because the actors and actresses were exceedingly homely in this movie?  A little bit of make-up would of been nice. Amanda Root is okay,  but definitely needs some fine tuning for the big screen. For me personally, the unattractive actors detracted from the story.     Also, hard to detect any feelings or chemistry between the two main characters. Besides looking at each other occasionally, and Amanda's character looking like a deer in headlights almost the whole time...very annoying..there was no chemistry on screen between the two. No established chemistry = bad, dull movie.    Anyway, not worth buying as I did, rent it, because at least then you won't be stuck with it. Sorry to be so harsh, but there it is.

014132161X|5.0|I loved her books when I was a child in the sixties and I love to think that they have been around for over a hundred years and yet they are still wonderful stories that don't feel at all old-fashioned. The world they are set in is certainly different from ours, which adds to their interest, but the writing is immediate and there is nothing mannered or didactic that one might associate with books from Victorian times. A combination of lively, very real children, with sometimes a little magic thrown in and sometimes just the adventures children have when they're not too closely supervised, the books are fast-paced, humorous and adorably wholesome.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|The dark, seemingly evil rabbit in \\"Donnie Darko\\", the movie written and directed by Richard Kelly, may stick in viewers' minds as much as Bugs Bunny stuck in mine as a child.  And, at the end of your first viewing, you too may be asking \\"what's up doc?\\"<br /><br />Tom Keogh, who wrote the review of this film for Amazon, stated that this movie is unclassifiable.  I don't necessarily agree with that view.  Although it is part drama, part romance and part teen movie, it is primarily science fiction, with a sub-category of time travel.  Keogh goes on to add that \\"Darko\\" is stunningly original--with that I do agree.  Richard Kelly seems to be able to aptly create a David Lynch-like atmosphere that will keep the audience watching--and guessing--until the end.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal does an admirable job in the title role and is supported by an ensemble cast, including his sister Maggie, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell (and even Ashley Tisdale in a small role).  Jake is able to give \\"Donnie Darko\\" the needed dark off-centered, delusional, mind set that shows in his eyes in the distant haunted stare he conjurs up at just the right time during the story.<br /><br />When it comes to eerie, mysterious science fiction flicks, you'll have a hard time finding another one nearly as good as \\"Donnie Darko\\".  If you haven't checked it out, now's the time.

The artwork is absolutely amazing, Jamie & Claire have both been captured beautifully and the minor characters and the backgrounds are accurate, detailed and generally wonderful.  Diana Gabaldon is known for the length of her books and, as one wit put it, even her comic books are long.  But every single page is well worth the reading.

End of pasting.    Nobody should deprive themselves of the GIFT OF OWNING this uniquely brilliant movie.  My two stars in no way refer to the film itself, it, the movie per se, deserves a galaxy's worth.    The 3 geniuses comprising the original fictional band, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean....have performed on tour in character as well as unwigged, as themselves.  Often with rock's greatest luminaries sitting in, and, I am sure, with a great sense of privilege and joy.    They continue to write & perform incredible music while also pursuing their other unique individual creative  endeavors.    And had it not been for some neat to see deleted scenes and some fun to catch pseudo videos of our fav tracks from the movie....I would have given this edition one star not two.    My intense disappointment---given I got the Criterion DVD mainly for the bonus material which I had never seen---was that the commentary track was done by the principals in character.    OMG, Noooooooooooo!    Am I the only rabid devote of this staggeringly fabulous movie starved for a commentary track by these guys as themselves,  bringing us accurate, esoteric, even arcane  data & insights re, in this case,  an often atypical, sometimes  improvised with flawless instincts... creative process ...and its genesis and unfolding??  (Breathe.)    The only besotted fan starved for a detailed account of actual events.... not by the endearingly self deluded,  adorably moronic, self important but musically gifted individuals these guys played.....but as the full on, uncommon geniuses they ARE????    Being an optimist....I salivate (well, kinda) anticipating the arrival of a new edition including the above commentary track.  I care far less about form including HD/bluray, etc....than I do about CONTENT.    One thing's for sure....if they went there, and for God's sake why wouldn't they???.....THAT edition would sell a bazillion units in record time.

B003O85W3A|4.0|When I listen to this album end to end, I find it pretty frustrating. There is a lot of great music, but not enough to make an enjoyable 60+ minute listen. I think part of my problem with it is that it is very wordy. While I like the general concept of the album, Win Butler is not Bob Dylan so when songs have lines and lines and lines of lyrics, I find myself losing interest.  Therefore my preference is to truncate the album into a leaner 45 minutes with a running order that focuses more on music and simpler lyrical themes:<br />2. Ready to Start (why would you not start an album with a track called Ready to Start?)<br />4. Rococo<br />5. Empty Room (I do wish this song were a little longer, leaving more time for the string theme)<br />6. City With No Children<br />15. Sprawl II<br />----<br />10. Month of May<br />3. Modern Man<br />13. We Used to Wait<br />8. Half Life II (to me a better climax than Sprawl II)<br />7. Half Life I<br />To me this set of 10 songs would make this my favorite album of the year so far. Sometimes less is more. I still listen to the other tracks occasionally, but when I do, I don't find that I'm missing much.<br /><br />That said, when I look at other reviews, some of my least favorite tracks are their favorites! Clearly this running order won't work for everybody, but I think a similar approach would work for the many people who find this to be a good but imperfect album.

B00005JNX0|4.0|I'll admit that I am a bit partial to talking animal CG animated features.  There is something about the personification of humans in highly stylized animal models that get me every time.  Plus the color pallets are usually spectacular.<br /><br />That said Madagascar was on my \\"to do\\" list for a long time! 5-years to be exact (never let it be said I rush into things).  I did Disney's The Wild first and both Open Seasons but this one here I held off on figuring it would be the best of the lot.  Did it live up to my expectations? Yes and no.  The look was fantastic, some of the humor worked (others not so much), and the cast was spectacular (Ben Stiller nails it) but it wasn't the laugh-fest I had hyped myself up for 5-years.  But I digress; let's look at the facts, shall we?<br /><br />Madagascar tells of New York's Central Park zoo where a showboating lion, a mid-life crisis suffering zebra, a neurotic giraffe & a bossy hippo do what they do in captivity each day.<br /><br />Marty the Zebra (voiced by Chris Rock) realizes that he will likely die within the confines of a cage and decides that he would like to see the wild after a depressing birthday party.<br /><br />His equally pampered friends Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) find themselves forced to escape the zoo as well (a zoo they just so happen not to mind) in effort to track down the runaway zebra.<br /><br />Unfortunately, their attempt at damage control does little more than to persuades zoo officials that captivity is apparently not agreeing with these particular specimens.  They are hence tranquilized and shipped off to live out their years in an animal preserve in Kenya.<br /><br />The plan may have worked too except that it turns out some escaped militant penguins have hijacked the ship in transit to Kenya and, as a result of their desire to check out their native Antarctica, get the animals' shipping crates detoured to the island of Madagascar.  The four unlikely protagonists suddenly find themselves in quite a predicament called surviving in the wild.<br /><br />The plot is pretty tight (enough so for Disney to rip it off in fact) but the biggest flaw here is that the type of puzzle-piece perfection that has become commonplace in Pixar's blockbusters (and even many of DreamWorks') isn't present.  There is a bit of layered humor (the lion's appetite for attention, the penguins' platoon-like behavior, the chimps who are actually scholars and so on) but for every truly brilliant moment, there are an equal number of missed opportunities.  Not the least of which comes in the total miscasting of Jada Pinkett Smith as the giant hippo and David Schwimmer's inability to elevate what should have been sheer hilarity as the hypochondriac giraffe.<br /><br /> Chris Rock and Ben Stiller create some natural chemistry however and truthfully, there is enough humor to compliment the unique visuals admirably.  With a brisk 86-minute runtime and a PG rating, the film often feels like it was actually designed to cater to adults over the younger set.<br /><br />In conclusion I fear it's my own expectations that kept this one from earning an even higher rating.  A shame really because all of the pieces are present, it just lacks that little something that pushes this type of project over the top in terms of comedic genius.  As it stands, this one earns a solid 3.5 stars from your truly but since half star ratings are a no-go, I'll round it up to four stars (for the antics of the penguins and monkeys if nothing else).onists suddenly find themselves in quite a predicament called surviving in the wild.

0385342047|5.0|If you are already a fan of Becky Bloomwood-Brandon, you won't be disappointed with Mini-Shopaholic.  It follows the same type of storyline as all of the other novels - scrapes, secrets, shopping, etc.  Absolutely loved it.  Wish it were longer and can't wait for the next chapter in Becky's life.  If you're a new reader, go back and read the earlier books.  Becky is a delightful character without a mean bone in her body.  It's just a nice, fun book to read and share.
B003UYUR10|5.0|When I first heard about this movie, saw the previews, I thought it looked ridiculous and just plain stupid. However because I am a huge Jake Gyllenhaal fan, I convinced myself to watch it. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, it was action packed and very entertaining. I have watched it many times since I first rented it and each time it is just as fun and amazing. I agree with earlier posts that as a fantasy movie you have to suspend some beliefs in order to fully appreciate the movie, just like any other fantasy or science fiction movie.     I recommend this to anyone, of any age. Don't judge the movie simply because you don't think Jake Gyllenhaal should do action movies. This just proved that he is an amazing actor.    If you aren't sure if you will like it, rent it first. From what I have seen you either love it or hate it.
0316044938|3.0|Leave it to me to read hot books that have since gone cold on the shelf. Not that this book is dead, but it's definitely old news.    I was told by more than a few people that I really needed to read this amazing new book called The Lovely Bones, several years ago. So, a year ago I bought it. This year I decided to actually read it.    I'm always so dubious of \\"amazing new reads.\\" But, via the omnipotent media hype, I had become sufficiently curious about this one. So, I piled into my puffy yellow reading chair and went to work.     Surprise, surprise, I was really enjoying it. I love a nonlinear storyline and Alice Sebold does a great job with it. The voice feels refreshing while keeping you glued with terror and suspense. There are some great moments and ideas throughout.    But then... dun, dun, dun!    Just over half way into it there is this subtle shift. Call it the falling action if you like - falling away from the first part of the book. I mean really subtle. Can't even put my finger on it. It seems to go from this thoughtfully written thriller to a teenage romance novel.    It started to get a little tedious. I could feel my body squirming, flipping around in my reading chair. Leg over the arm rest. Sitting up straight. Slouching. Indian style. Head on ottoman, feet in air. The pages became so sticky sweet I could hardly turn them.     I'd think I'd made some headway, then I'd look up and there'd still be at least a quarter of the book left.    I thought, \\"Forevermore! When will this book end? Why cannot I read faster?\\"     I mean, I was invested. I wasn't not going to finish. I needed to know.     I went to refresh my ice water, and took a moment to step out onto the back porch to take in the night air and enjoy a cookie. Once I felt refortified, I marched back to my reading chair like a soldier to the front. I was going to finish the thing, damnit.    Then, in chapter 22, this line happened: \\"Ruth is doing spoken word, but she'll come back.\\" That was whenI threw up my hands in outrage. The line was so out of place, so out of character and mood that it just took me completely out of the book    Spoken word wasn't in common vernacular until the turn of the 21st century. And spoken word itself really didn't come into being until the late 1980s. This story is set in the 1970s. How was something so obvious missed in editing? The glaring anachronistic mistake is just part of what pissed me off. It's around this time in the book that the characters just seem to be, well, out of character.    (I don't normally like to reveal too much about what is actually in a book, but this next part has to be said, even if you, dear reader, have no clue as to what I am talking about. My apologies.) And I don't think Ruth is doing spoken word. She's probably looking down in shock and horror on her body being exposed and used as a sexual surrogate by her dead friend's ghost. And this seems to be the climax of the story - absolutely no pun intended. So, this girl who was brutally raped and murdered, her one afterlife goal is to have sex with a boy that kissed her once. Not to tell her friend where she is buried, not to point the finger at her killer, not to talk to her family one more time, but to jump into her friend's body and make it have sex with her male friend (who somehow accepts this with little resistance)in the back of a dirty bike shop. Uhm? Paranormal rape anyone?     It was provocative alright. Provoked me right into hating reading. Yes. I was actually mad at reading for about two and a half days.     I left the book on a side table with a banana peel wrapped in a paper towel on top of it. When I passed by it the next day I realized what I had done. From then on, it smelled like a rotting banana...appropriately.    \\"A triumphant novel...It's a knockout.\\" - Time    This is the review planted right on the cover! Above the title! I mean I expected this book to blow my hair so far back that it would end up in a wig for some ancient Egyptian prince.    After pondering on it a bit, I realized I wasn't as mad at the book as I was with the hype. This book that my book-reading friends absolutely gooed over. This book that had been made into a major feature film with a really good cast and crew. This book that made me so mad. I was starting to feel like a heel. I needed to get over it and give the thing another chance.    \\"Don't start The Lovely Bones unless you can finish it. The book begins with more horror than you could imagine, but closes with more beauty than you could hope for.\\" - Christian Science Monitor (as printed on the back cover)    \\"Okay. Fine, fine, Christian Science Monitor (who ends sentences with a preposition). I'll finish it,\\" I begrudged.    So, I finally picked The Lovely Bones up again, and the relationship resumed.    The action fell and fell, like a sprinter cooling down after a race. When I'd finally finished it, I was pretty much pissed off again. I wanted to throw the book up in the air and shoot it like skeet. \\"Screw you, book!\\"    I don't have a scholarly reason for it. I think some story decisions were made that just went against what I expected, and not in a way that's enlightening. Just choices that didn't seem right. But maybe that's just me.    This book is worth reading. It is well written. It has really nice moments. Sebold has the touch for painting a picture that stays in your mind. But, just don't expect, \\"A stunning achievement.\\" - The New Yorker
B003PIUBZS|1.0|I began watching this hoping for something like 300 which I loved. Then came the Big Bang where Spartacus has a very detailed sex romp with his \\"mate\\". I concluded the rest of the series would be porn just like this and turned it off and sent it back to Netflix unviewed. I am sick of this junk in moves from Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas's naked behinds to Pretty Woman the sweet romantic prostitute.
0307463745|5.0|This book is a great collection of ideas that will help you to succeed in business. Although presented ideas are based on common sense, some of them strongly disagree with current usual business practices. Still problem is with current business practices and not with presented ideas.    Reading \\"Rework\\" can be great motivator for starting work smarter (rather than harder), seeking long-term sustainable business (rather than achieving better financial results for the current quarter) and really serving customer needs (rather then trying to trick him into buying irrelevant product).    There are two shortcomings of this book. First, a lot of ideas presented here are taken from another book by the same authors - \\"Getting Real\\". Therefore, if you have already read \\"Getting Real\\", reading some chapters in \\"Rework\\" will be deja vu experience. Second, if you work in \\"usual\\" company with no sufficient influence to change its business practices, reading this book can be a serious morale-killer.    Anyway, I highly recommend reading this book to everybody (and especially to everybody running some business or thinking about starting one).
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This CD/DVD set is really wonderful! I would recommend it to anyone who loves music, regardless of their age. Check it out!
0307463745|5.0|Rework is very well written and edited. I enjoyed reading the book and felt that it gave me insight into alternative methods of business management. While a lot of the principles in the book are common sense, the book is laid out well and the simple examples drive these points home. Other business books discuss theories and complex methods of management. Rework cuts through the crap and looks at the core of business. Put simply, Rework it for people that want to get things done rather than talking about getting things done.
0374158460|1.0|It beggers belief that so bad a book could be published.  DO NOT BUY THIS DRAM OF DRECH!  The reviews are completely wrong, along with all the fanfare (Obama is reading it, etc).    The worst aspects of The Corrections are magnified horribly: lack of sympathetic characters, no sense of quest among any of them -- leaving a sickening anomie...tired language and even cliches, absence of plot, disordered perspectives,lack of theme.  Had this been his first book, his career never would have ever begun.  Not sure he deserves another chance.    It is the literary equivalent of stepping in dog doo on a hot and humid NYC sidewalk.  Astounding!      The Corrections was pretty good.  But this is a disaster.

B003R0LBVW|1.0|I've read 2 1/2 other books since I began Freedom, and I'm still only 89% of the way through. It's all unhappiness, uneasiness, and there's not a page of joy. There is no reason for any character to get out of bed or take their antidepressants because there's only more ridiculous self-created trauma next.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|I agree with the many previous comments on the quality of this show. My only complaint is over the lack of English sub-titles - an item that was going to be provided. Since the cost of sub-titling in the original language is minimal and since about 5-10% of the viewing population want them this baffles me. This, by the way is a growing % as homes become more multi-generational with widely differing sleep and viewing habits. But if this is not a problem - a highly recommended show.
0439023513|5.0|Love and admiration for Katniss, a brave and fierce young woman!  This is a wonderful end to a well-written trilogy; however, bittersweet (and that makes for a fantastic story).  After reading Catching Fire, I had eagerly anticipated Mockingjay and was not disappointed.  It is compelling, frightening, heartbreaking, and breathtaking, leaving the reader wondering about ones' self; who we were in our beginning, what caused the changes in our life along our own journey - life can change tremendously in an instant - and who we have or would like to become.  And most importantly, what have we lost along the way?  Do not miss this trilogy!
B000001FDK|4.0|I decided to buy this cd ..because i am having a big birthday party ...and my friends love this movie and alot of the songs. The quality sounds really great and I think that it will really keep my  party going strong..Amazon has really fast service I did not have worry about my cd getting here on time..My grease party will now be complete..
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|Wow!  This the most interesting book I've read in ages.  I, too, am a shopaholic so I can relate to her thoughts and all the justifications she comes up with for buying something she just has to have.  Even though I'm a senior citizen and the character is a young girl, I feel like we are sisters!  But it's not just that, I really admire the writer for her sense of humor and great writing style. I've read so many books that I lose interest in halfway, but this one kept me reading and turning pages so I could find out what happened next.  Love it and will be buying all the other \\"Shopaholic\\" books.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Wow a real martial arts movie without all the bull crap wires and inhumanly possible stunts.  Yeah those movies are entertaining, but are soon forgotten.  This film should have been released on the big screen. Would have easily been the martial arts/action film of the summer of 2010 or whenever it first came out. I just learned about it from a friend who is now studying JKD (Bruce Lee's Style) and I have now told everyone I know about this awesome awesome awesome movie!  I watched it three time in 2 days and bought it immediately for my film library.  My wife and family loved it too!  A must see, a must own, a must watch over and over again!!!  Two thumbs and two big toes up!    Thomas T in the USA
B0037FFB3G|5.0|I owned this album in my teens during the late 60's - early 70's, and it sounds even better now in its reissued version.  The quality of printing on the cover and gatefold is excellent as well.  It was a joy to put it on a turntable again and hear it the way I used to play it.  So if you owned this album when it originally came out in 1969, but have since lost it, or it's now unplayable (or no longer in your possession and you can't get it back), my suggestion is spend the $40 and buy a new copy.  It is undoubedly one of the Airplane's best, and it should be in your collection.
0399536108|5.0|What I loved most about this book is that it's not preachy. Chris is actually living proof that yes, you don't have to conform to a modern work/life balance.    The book is incredibly well-written and constructed, and truly is a life-changing read.
B00008G9JN|5.0|What an album this is!!! It's hard even to begin talking about it. A mixture of unbelievable arrangements, harmonies, time-signatures - and one of the best group of musicians ever assembled - Songs From The Wood was released in 1977 and marked a shift in direction with Ian Anderson's new-found love for the British countryside. Full of mystical, powerful green imagery, the music speaks for itself in rich, crispy textures. British music at its very best without a doubt. Funny to think England was then all littered with punks who could never even grasp the deeper meanings contained herein.  Songs From The Wood may well be Jethro Tull's greatest achievement... But, of course, there are at least five others which would be at the same level: everything from Stand Up to Thick As A Brick and also Minstrel In The Gallery!!!
B0035V35PI|4.0|ITS A NINJA MOVIE!! Lots of fighting, awesome stunts, great fight sequences, and over the top action. This movie is shockingly gory, just be aware.  The only thing I would have done different was to have the scenes in Japan spoken in Japanese and subtitled.  It would have helped I think.  But that is really nit picking.  The story is good enough for an action/ninja movie, we dont need or want Shakespear.  Its supposed to be fun and entertaining, and it delivers on both counts.  Blu-Ray wise the sound is fantastic, the video is good but the whole movie is VERY dark, so if you have weak contrast you may see some issues.  I love the purity of this movie, it exceeded what I thought a \\"ninja movie\\" could be.
B00006GO99|3.0|Granted, this album is significant because it's the first Columbia album by Monk.  But it's not my favorite.  The music seems lighter and more casual and commercial than I'd like.  I much prefer \\"The Measure of Monk\\" CD, also available at Amazon.  I have listened to Monk's \\"Ruby, My Dear\\" more times than I can count and I will continue to do so, it is fantastic, as is the rest of the collection on that CD.

B0000640VO|3.0|This film was artistic and enjoyable. If you don't want to read subtitles then you better know French. The main character of the film is an oddball who is also pretty easy to relate to. I really liked the movie, but I'm not sure I'd watch it again. One time was plenty for me.
1400168171|5.0|I found 'The Music Lesson\\" very thought provoking and very enjoyable to listen to whilst driving. It prompted me to look at the different elements of music in new ways. I found the concepts had relevance to life in general not just music. I often have long drives and the audio CD  was a great way to fill the time during these drives.

I just had to own the DVD.  The story made me laugh and it also made me cry, which is a great formula for a romantic comedy.  I thought Jennifer Lopez was great, but Alex made the film for me.

1608100197|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone who must make decisions concerning which of many important tasks to take care of first.  Setting and keeping priorities are difficult anyway and this author has some good suggestions on how to take charge of the process.  Distractions can interrupt vital tasks and create more stress while decreasing productivity.
0439023513|5.0|If you read Hunger Games and Catching Fire then you have to read Mockingjay. It's a very suspenseful book! You'll be shocked at what happens to Katniss, Gale and Peeta. It's a good ending to a great series.
0887306667|4.0|This book was well written with good examples (some a little dated).  It's clear that these are well reasoned \\"laws\\" or marketing, but what it lacks is a concrete path on how to implement them into your business.      Also, I'm a small business owner and it's not exactly for me.  I think it's better for someone working at a big firm with an awfully large budget.
0545101425|3.0|The first two books were great, but this last one is so sick and massively twisted, and no one is ever saved, just tortuered and murdered in the most horrible ways imagined, time after time after time.  Needed a lot more light for my liking.  Myself and my husband will never read or listen to this book again.  It is in the trash because we don't want anyone we care about to read it either.<br />Definitely NOT for young adults or older ones either.<br />I must say, so far, the movies are way better, they edited them perfectly!!
B002MBXUVQ|5.0|We had seen this movie years ago and wanted it as the 3rd Conan type movie.  This movie was done before the overuse of computer animation and uses creative techniques and impressive costuming that must have been a lot of work to create. Although the plot is simpler than the other Conan movies, it makes for light adventure entertainment after a busy day's work. The quality of the VHS tape was fine and was exactly what we expected.
B000ASDFEU|5.0|Great movie! I like because it's a true story and it shows how men do acts of heroism, even knowing that they have no chance to reach their goal and they're fighting against all odds.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|By \\"real\\", I mean authentic, not \\"real heavy\\", although it certainly is.  Volbeat have pulled off a musical challenge that maybe only the Michale Graves-era Misfits came close to accomplishing, and that is the ultra heavy metal aggressiveness of today's hardest outfits, including support from Metallica crossed with the songwriting skills of the rock and roll greats of the fifties and sixties.<br />  The weapon that makes this such a volatile mix is singer Michael Poulsen, who possesses one of the great voices out there today.  His voice is vintage rock and roll, and gives the songs huge hooks, something most heavy outfits seem to be incapable of.  It's guitars forged in the fires of Slayer and Motorhead with thrash precision zapped back in time to sock hops, cruisers, drive-ins, and the hard life of street characters.  If Elvis or Gene Vincent had had these kind of guitars in their day, there's no telling how violent the reaction from the rock and roll haters of the day would have been!<br />  But Volbeat aren't a retro act, nor are they a novelty.  \\"Guitar Gangsters and Cadillac Blood\\", like their predecessors, is a gem with fantastic songwriting and a cover of Hank Williams' \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" that has to be heard to be believed.<br />  Plus, there's a bit more lead guitar this time around, although still a bit sparse.  That's okay, but I'd personally dig some hellacious lead work that recalled real rock and roll ala Brian Setzer.  The Volbeats stand in musical no man's land, bridging the gap between metal and rock and roll, where it all began in the first place.  Metal outfits would do well to study these guys and see how real vocals can add so much dimension, and how real songs, not just exercises in concussions, are written.
0783225733|5.0|I recently purchased a movie and it was defective. I feel guilty now but I wrote a bad review for the company.  I never contacted them but I got an email where they refunded my money. I want to praise you for seeing my comment and acting on it.  I will definitely keep you in mind next time I need to make a purchase.  I just wish I knew how to go and delete the negative feedback I left earlier.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Actually, that's not the case with me.  But anyhow...<br /><br />So many good reviews of this movie have been written about the plot, etc.  I just want to give my evaluation and opinion of various things.<br /><br />The Shining (1980) is based on the novel by Stephen King.  Director Stanley Kubrick gave us a masterpiece.  I like nearly everything about this movie.  I remember seeing it on cable TV around 1980 and 1981.  This is a different kind of horror movie in that it is not over the top with LOTS of blood and gore and LOTS of killing.  Instead, it's a movie that has a moderate amount of blood and killings (with the exception of the scene with the tidal wave of blood), but it's greatest strength is its reliance on atmosphere and the gradual buildup of tension and horror.  Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) gradually becomes a madman over time.  Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) becomes increasingly terrified.  Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd) is effective as the son that possesses psychic abilities.  The story and setting are very simple.  The hotel itself seems to be a character itself.  The atmosphere in the hotel is eerie with a sense of emptiness, but frightening.  There's a feeling that strange and horrifying things are bound to happen in this huge vacant hotel.  Again, the buildup to all-out madness is the movie's strongest point.<br /><br />The camera angles that are used at times are very innovative.<br /><br />The best acting performance in this movie was by Shelley Duvall, in my opinion.  She was totally believable.  Jack Nicholson also gave a great performance.<br /><br />The electronic musical score is great and very memorable.  It's the kind of music that crawls under your skin and adds to a tense atmosphere.<br /><br />My favorite scenes are the bar scene where Jack is having a drink and talking to the bartender, the scene where Wendy discovers what Jack has been typing all along, and the chase around the maze during the snowstorm.<br /><br />This movie is a classic that has stood the test of time.  It's definitely one of the all-time great horror movies.  Stephen King himself actually hated it, but horror movie fans generally like it.<br /><br />This two-DVD set contains commentary by Steadicam inventor and operator Garrett Brown and historian John Baxter, the theatrical trailer, Vivian Kubrick's documentary called The Making Of The Shining, and featurettes called View From The Overlook: Crafting The Shining, The Visions Of Stanley Kubrick, and Wendy Carlos, Composer.<br /><br />I highly recommend The Shining to all horror fans.ely one of the all-time great horror movies.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book had my attention from the very first chapter.  The love the narrator had for the inanimate objects that made up his world made me see how he replaced what we all take for granted.  Everything was considered his family, taking the idea that he could have as much love for \\"Plant\\" as any other child could for an Aunt or Uncle.  His love for Room can only be matched by his mother's hatred for the same room along with her circumstances.<br /><br />The story flowed beautifully as Jack learned to understand first his mother's need to be rescued from Room to learning all the new experiences of Outer Space.  The month in which the story take place seems like years and is so detailed you can't believe how quickly the time has passed.<br /><br />Truly enjoyable story from start to finish.
B003Y7L5W8|5.0|When I first heard OMD was releasing a new album I was excited, as I'd been happy with the past few albums under the guidance of Andy McCluskey - knowing I'd rather have a solo OMD than no OMD. When I heard this new album was going to include all four original members, I was ecstatic.     What they've achieved with History of Modern is not only a wink to their past, but a foothold into their future. Saying this is their best album in a few decades is accurate in the way that \\"Yes\\" was the best album in a few decades for the Pet Shop Boys. It's a return to form. It's a collective example of how a band can use the sounds they've created over the years and breathe new life into them. It's a difficult task for most bands and could have been an uphill battle, but for History of Modern it sounds easy. It sounds natural.     Songs like \\"HOM Part 1\\", \\"The Right Side\\" and \\"New Babies : New Toys\\" are absolutely euphoric and beyond anything I'd dreamed imaginable. Others such as \\"HOM Part 2\\", \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"If You Want It\\" are songs that any other band would kill to have in their arsenal of music. Catchy and unforgettable, the songs on HOM are also the best produced I've ever heard from OMD - the production is flawless. No rush job here.     With that, I'd say 60% of HOM is outstanding. Pristine pop with one foot planted firmly in the electronic maturity of it all. Another four or so songs are amazingly well crafted and break up the ear candy just enough to let your feet relax and appreciate the depth that this album has to offer. There are a couple tracks that are slow growers, but hey, that's the truth with almost every album - but having a 13-track album of this quality from OMD in 2010? Unheard of, until now. No complaints.     What I like most about this album is that OMD have created something that has been needed from them - a benchmark to reflect upon everything they've released in the course of their career while looking forward. Knowing that History of Modern is THIS good, makes me all the more excited as to what the follow up will sound like, as surely this can't be their last album. I'm hoping in many ways this is a new beginning.
193413712X|5.0|Tinkers is a work of art that uses words and the earth of New England to sculpt the essence of the experience of living.  Though author Harding smashes the rules of plot development and reassembles them like so many mosaic tiles, his use of symbolism, theme, setting, voice and character is as rugged and monumental as the granite outcroppings of the land it portrays.  It is easy to see why it was selected for the Pulitzer Prize, which seeks works that are not only written by Americans but reflect on some aspect of American life.<br /><br />Tinkers' largest theme is universal in terms of time and place but its articulation is pure New England.  Its sense of place compares to Ethan Frome, Our Town and The Country of the Pointed Firs.  It is the exploration of what defines living, and how a single life by its end carries with it the sum of its past and that of forebears.  This highly abstract concept is thrown into relief by the objective imagery of people who have invested their lives in the stuff of daily life. George, the horologist (timekeeping specialist, a clock repairman) at the center of the novel, lies dying surrounded by several generations of his extended family while his antique clock collection insistently ticks.  George channels his father's remarkable story, a salesman/tinker who traveled rural New England, bringing cookware and tools to the most isolated outposts.<br /><br />It is easier to compare this work to other art forms that exist in dimensions other than its own, like sculpture or symphonies and concertos.  While the lack of a linear plot may flummox some readers, this book leaves you with a vision of life, the universal human condition as well as an American existence rooted in a particular age, one that is quickly passing.
B0043IMW4W|5.0|AWESOME live album!!  The only thing that would make this better is a LIVE BLU-RAY release of the show!!!
B0044430H8|5.0|Scores for films these days have become canned sounding and typical. When I was a kid (1970s) soundtracks used to be as important as every other element of the film and not simply something slapped on by some score jockey to make the film complete. Decades later I still enjoy the score to Star Wars, A Clockwork Orange, Superman, Akira, etc... I remember back in the day even garbage films would have a decent score. Time Rider and Remo Williams are 2 examples. Today this is no longer the norm and dozens and dozens of BIG FILM scores come and go and I leave theaters having not noticed the music at all. Once in a while I am surprised. Recent films like There Will Be Blood, Code 46, and most recently MONSTERS all had decent music scores. The social network is no exception, delivering, in my opinion, one of the finest scores to come along in quite some time. That the score stands alone on its own as listenable, tangible music, long before I have even seen the film is testament to its power and visceral nature.<br /><br />I like the minimal nature of the music and am reminded, somewhat, of Aphex Twin. There is also an undercurrent, here and there, of early classic video game sounds peppered throughout. It's not overused and I enjoy these sounds. They help give the score a tangential connection back to the first Atari some of us older dudes knew as the very first piece of real technology that came into our homes and altered our lives. Since then the pace of new technology has quickened and with the internet and computers the classic version of the inventor and tinkerer has been literally reborn as young software programmers with ideas, rather than devices. I love how Mark Zuckerberg changed the world from his dorm room. I also love how I am noticing a history of electronics embedded and layered within this fantastic music.<br /><br />I could go on and on but for the price that this score is being offered at, seriously, stop reading and download it already.
B0043IJ67S|4.0|.....album artwork stink??  This has got to be the worst album cover for Clapton's entire catalog.  It looks like a cheesy bootleg cover.  Come on!  Otherwise....GREAT album!!
B003JIPJRE|4.0|Service part:    I wanted to watch this movie before i would buy it, so i ordered it 'on demand' to download on my computer.  I paid the price, yet, it wouldn't download. After several tries to find it i went back to the movie page and selected the 'watch now' option. After the movie i checked my credit card, i was double billed, i called customer service, and they notified the right department, since it was closed at that time. It's been a week without any response from Amazon. So, when u wanna watch something, make sure u watch it right there, do not download it to your computer, since u might end up paying twice the price.    Movie part:    Great movie, i was hoping it would be as dark as 'the Dark Knight' movie, and i was not disappointed.  A must see for Batman fans!  Will buy a Collector's Edition to add to my Batman movies.
B003YRIM0Q|5.0|Let me lead off by saying this is an incredibly beautiful and thoughtfully designed box set which is not going to appeal to fans hankering to get their hands on a Nirvana styled WITH THE LIGHTS OUT type boxset. I can somewhat understand the need for some hardcore fans to air those sorts of grievances, but ultimately that's judging Telephantasm on what it is not, versus what it is, setting that aside, this box set is an incredible piece. The housing is dramatic, and the artwork obviously a huge part of the appeal, featuring panoramic two-sided posters, reproductions of the bands litho from the first reunion show in April 2010 at the showbox, art prints of the band members, and individually colored heavy triple LP of the 24 tracks, a booklet featuring rare photos alongside Kim Thayil's entertaining liner notes completes the added goodies. This will surely become a collectors piece in the ensuing years. The highlights are really the band's first ever DVD, which gathers all the music videos along with some rare live performance, 20 videos in all, 13 previously unreleased . Highlights include uncensored versions of BLOW UP THE OUTSIDE WORLD, the rarely seen overseas version of PRETTY NOOSE along side the classic videos for OUTSHINED, RUSTY CAGE and BLACK HOLE SUN. The audio has been remastered and a significant improvement over the previous hits collection A-SIDES, and features 5 previously unreleased tracks, including the spectacular live performance of PRETTY NOOSE from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE and a rarely seen performance from MTV Live N Loud of BLOW UP THE OUTSIDE WORLD in addition to the new single BLACK RAIN a resuscitated gem from the fan favorite BADMOTORFINGER sessions.     SUPER COOL FAN ALERT - not noted in the packaging, the band tossed in a colored 7\\" of BLACK RAIN and a previously unreleased live version of BEYOND THE WHEEL from the show box show!
B000X2H8G4|3.0|We purchased the amplifier for older adults who attend a day treatment program.  These individuals have shared that they are able to hear the discussion better because of the amplifier.  We ended up having to purchase a second one, so they wouldn't fight over the one we had.
B003XX2PPO|5.0|I totaly agree with those, including myself, who are asking for a change in Luis  Miguel`s musical style and arrengements;however, to say that this cd is not worth it or good is completely wrong.Even though the songs and musical arrengements are similar to 20 anos or amarte es un placer, they are still good songs, lots of funky,full of rythym.it is true that manzanero`s song are actually good but sound so similar that you don`t know where one ends and the other one begins.Still is a great cd and there is nothing new to say about his voice.The best out there, with only March anthony at his level but without luis miguel`s magic.I love this cd and his voice.Maybe he will surprise us next time by reinventing himself and taking some musical challenges.In the meantime, let`s enjoy more of the same which is nothing but great.

0061478784|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle may have originally been intended for the young teenage set, but my great-granddaughter is almost 24 and madly in love with the book. She saw the Hiyao Miyazaki movie first, then read the book at our local library. She's now read her own copy at least 15 times since we bought it and she falls more and more in love with Howl, Sophie, Michael, and Calcifer every time. This book is a terrific read.
0811870413|4.0|Some background:  I am an advanced home baker with a couple years of professional baking under my belt, many years ago, so  that is the perspective from which I write this review.    What this book is: a compilation of recipes from Tartine Bakery. There are only a few bread recipes, and then a collection of dishes made with those breads.  What it is not: a comprehensive bread baking book, or a book for beginners.    There really are only a few bread recipes in this book.  The author goes into lengthy detail about his breads, his philosophy, and how to make them. For those of you who are familiar with Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking's treatise on how to make an omelet (it's about 20 pages long), that is what you will find here, just a lot fewer recipes.  Why?  Because Tartine specializes in making a few breads and pastries, and this book is about their bakery.      If you are looking for a comprehensive baking book of artisan breads, try Jeffrey Hamelman's \\"Bread.\\"  If you want easy, tasty recipes for most home bakers, take a look at the King Arthur Flour baking books, or Beth Hensperger's excellent \\"Bread Bible.\\"    So, if you are not into creating and nursing sourdough starters, or you have no interest in reading through 20 pages of instructions to teach you how to make an artisan loaf of Tartine bread, this is not the book for you. There are plenty of other wonderful books on the market for that.    I would recommend this book for intermediate or advanced home bakers, or for professionals who are really looking to expand their bread baking repertoire.    The book does have some of the most detailed photos on folding and shaping loaves that I've seen, but the \\"artsy\\" quality of those photos is really irritating - I don't want to see special shadowing, I just want a clear picture of a technique.
B003BKF6AU|3.0|The boxer is a top 5 star album, this one is not. LP is not worth to pay extra not showing any sonic improvments over CD version. So i you are a fan you can enjoy it, but if this will be your first National album start with the Boxer.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Knowing just a few of Queen's major hits I wanted to buy theis Blu-ray after reading the rave reviews on the Audio/Video alone. I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it to the younger crowd out there who may be stunned to know people actually played instruments years ago and didn't put out cookie-cutter crap that exists nowadays.<br /><br />  Highly recommend for the performance, audio and video is also top notch.
B003F5WOEC|5.0|Excellent LP sounds vs CD ( i have both good source for both CD and Record players). They sound far better on analog, i have also Attack and Release album on both CD and LP which you dont hear the difference like this album. Brothers will be Brothers with black plastic....
B003PGNBO8|2.0|There is no proper ending. The show ends and you are left hanging.Just another way to takes money out of our pockets.
B0002ONALU|5.0|i bought firt the CD of the album which is a 5 star perfect album. Then i bought the LP hoping some sonic improvments of the format but LP is nothing special, did not add anything to sound quality unlike some albums which i own both on CD and LP.
0345505387|5.0|I absolutely love this graphic novel.  The pictures are stunning and the story has humour, new twists, and characters to love.  I think it was wonderfully well done.  It is a great collaboration between Diana Gabaldon and Hoang Nguyen.  As we look forward to the next installment of the series (don't know how anyone could mistake this for it, but i digress) this is a wonderful addition to my collection of great things.  I have read it a few times and look forward to many more re-reads.  I agree with the person about hanging up some of the frames.  The artistry is wonderful.    Janie
B003WSFXKY|1.0|Don't bother buying this CD. After buying it and listening to the whole thing, I had a headache and a nervous twitch. To me, it sounded like generic versions of the originals overlaid with constant, loud wah-wah guitar.    I've liked Santana since the late '60's. Some of his stuff from back then and some from the '80's is true classic rock. If this CD is a tribute to classic guitar rock, some of the songs don't deserve to be on it. For the songs that do deserve to be on a tribute CD, a terrible sacrilege has been done to them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i have been looking for a great book for the longest time to recommend to my students. this fits the bill. what's more? it's part of a series! what luck!
B000000WZ4|5.0|That anyone would dislike this album makes me sad. This album is so beautiful I want to cry. I have fallen in love with it.
B0044430H8|5.0|I can't wait for this movie. I'm a fan of David Fincher's films since Fight Club. With Trent, NIN frontman, and Atticus Ross behind the soundtrack, there's no doubt some serious music is going to come out. With a free preview on [...], the first five tracks sound amazing, and when I listened to the rest of the album, I was amazed on how great it is. It fits that social network world and add a mood to the music. It's going to go well with the rest of the film. I know NIN fans will download this, but I highly encourage others to listen to this.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Wow folks! I am so thrilled about this release. I heard \\"The Abyss\\" and \\"Teutonic Terror\\" on the Eddie Trunk Live show on SIRIUS and loved the songs but had doubts that there might be only a song or two on this release that would be as good. NOT SO! Every track is a prime-cut and I love this record from start to finish. Vocals are something from the past, yet sound very fresh and the guitars that are up-front and in your face.<br /><br />I was 11 years old in 1970 when I first heard \\"Black Sabbath\\" and have been a follower of all-music-heavy ever since. Even though I enjoy many genres, I'm always searching for great Metal and this is probably Accepts finest record to date...and they've been around for a while.<br /><br />No disrespect to Udo, but the same reasons that I liked his voice are also the same reasons that I disliked when he was with the band. I really do NOT like a singing \\"Over-achiever\\". Someone who screams to the heights of their range, and just over does it. Brian Johnson from AC/DC comes to mind. Mark Tornillo knows what he can do with his voice and exactly when to quit.<br /><br />This album will be playing in my mix for the rest of my years. Thanks Accept! I hope other bands listen to this and follow suit.<br /><br />Bravo Accept! And Thank You!<br /><br />Give Em The Axe!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|If you like older Eminem, then you will love this. Just make sure if you have any \\"little ears\\" around this is not playing. Definitly not for children.

B003O85W3A|5.0|The perceptions on display in Arcade Fire's \\"Suburbs\\" seem remarkably reminiscent of T. S. Elliot's \\"Four Quartets\\" as well as Bob Dylan's \\"Desolation Row.\\"  This incredibly important critical strain in American art sings a song to us that we usually cannot hear because of the noise of the bankers and the politicians. Passion and Agony have rarely been sung with such eloquence.
0525951652|5.0|sorry publisher no to kindle and no to hard copy..may read it from library or just give it a pass..lots of good, fairly priced books out there...greed is not something to reward!!<br /><br />Ok one year later..I bought the book, hard copy from Costco.  I greatly enjoyed it.  Ken Follett is one of the few current authors that not only can tell a great story..but teach you a little history at the same time.  You really start to like (or dislike) many of his characters.  I really love the ending story line.
B003XX2PD6|4.0|Just love it when an Album slides through to my conscience like this.  After one listen, here it is now, the new Deerhunter album, Halcyon Digest.<br /><br />This one feels a little rough but in to the first three very poppy tracks the music is in me.  I like the themes in lyrics.  To say \\"dark\\" would be obvious and repetitive, I seem to get an underground ambient listening experience.  Lyrically writing form the point of view of an Russian sex-slave is tragic yet beautifully forgiving.  \\"Helicopter\\" is a stand out jam, that washes over the listener in waves of passion.  Good recording, song structure improving, (ideas, instruments) and a fourth element of Soul in the delivery and the way BC puts his heart (and dreams) out on his sleeve.<br /><br />Love tacks: \\"Fountain Stairs\\" & \\"Coronado\\" Absolutely genius sequencing these two tracks back to back.  \\"Memory Boy\\" grows on you and is a quick, easy number.<br /><br />After listening to this album five or six times, I realized the last four tracks are just insanely, beautiful, stellar songs that are excellently written, excellently played and most remarkably; recorded.  The mix and flow of the whole album is brilliant. Overall mix: Brilliant.<br /><br />  Like my ears are three or four floors below ground.  To hear saxophone in the stereo field arising, is just pure heaven and a large Step for DH.  Man I like this bands' flow.  As an album, this one will hold up.  I have four stars instead of five cause this band is capable of Beatles White Album-type stuff.  Or maybe the hype just got carried away.  Or I got carried away!  At any rate, I am a fan that looks forward to records by this band.<br /><br />  Can't wait for more.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|With the electronic era ending, the 90's starting up, and a new producer, RUSH decided to go back to there rock roots with this album. I think I was one of the few that liked there electronic stuff, but this album is a good reminder of how good of  a rock band RUSH is. The album that got them back in the right direction of rock!
B003Y7L5W8|5.0|There's been a recent resurge of electronic music in the past few years and though it's stayed mostly in UK/Europe and hasn't crossed the pond to the states yet, hopefully with this, the first OMD album in 14 years, that will quickly change!  14 years is a long time but founding members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys have found a way to bridge the gap of time and produce what could arguably be called one of their best albums of their career. Offering a hybrid of new and old sounds, this gem is likely to not only please the long-standing fans but grab a whole new generation who, perhaps unknowingly, have been listening to OMD through influence in bands such as The Killers and LCD Soundsystem.<br /><br />Opener NEW BABIES: NEW TOYS comes rearing out of the gate with a 'take that' attitude. It's edgier than what many think or remember OMD sounding but easily fits into todays mainstream with its bombastic bass, distorted vocals and heavy, head-bopping beats. It's followed by IF YOU WANT IT, a song written originally by Mr. M. for one of his past girl bands. Filled with a catchy chorus and choral \\"aws\\" it works, much in thanks to the retention of his valuable vocal quality at the ripe YOUNG age of 51!<br /><br />HoM PART 1 and 2 are definitely OMD in their \\"pop hits\\" area and PART 1 is, in my opinion, OMD at their best. Mr. H.s synths, earlier described as 'call and reply' play well with Mr. M.s addicting melody, laced with lovely harmonies. I challenge anyone to try sitting still for this one!<br /><br />SOMETIMES is a slower, groovy number with additional vocal samples by Jennifer John to help get across the message of despondent love, while RFWK is one of a couple Kraftwerk-ish songs but rightfully so since it's a tribute to the band and their influences on both Mr. M. and Mr. H. With touching offerings displayed in lyrics \\"I loved you when I found you, I loved you like a son\\" draped in synthetic, almost whiny keys, it makes one wonder just where these two would be in life had they not been in the crowd at the Kraftwerk show as teens!<br /><br />And then there's NEW HOLY GROUND! This is a definite tear-jerker of a song. It begins with the sound of a woman's high heels hitting the ground as she paces the floor; an absolutely striking element to the song that repeatedly paints a vivid image to match the songs theme of profound self reflection and renewal. Add in deep, cello-like sounds and an achingly beautiful single key melody, along with vocals that crack with emotion and you've got one of the most moving songs on the album! (Plus the fact that it was created in literally hours is just proof of the magic these two can do when in a room together.)<br /><br />THE FUTURE, THE PAST, AND FOREVER AFTER is a quirky little disco ditty that screams Georgio Moroder and could definitely get a dance floor going in both a retro and a modern club. SISTER MARIE SAYS, by Mr. M.s account, was a song shelved way back in the early days for sounding too much like Enola Gay but given new life with modern technology, it's much like the HoMs, good ol' OMD synth-pop!<br /><br />PULSE, ah, PULSE....yes well, to put it mildly, it stands out. It's a song that is probably the farthest from OMD than any can be and will cause many (including myself)to blush or drop the jaw because of it's, shall I say 'adult' nature. It's filled with deep, seductively breathy vocals from Mr. M. with an almost equally alluring female backing track, all layered over an irresistible dance beat. What's not to like?! ;o)<br /><br />After that, the cd takes a slower, more 'back to the beginning' approach. GREEN is in the realm of NHG with it's achingly divine melody and lyrical content that gets matched by Mr. H.s, captivating instrumentation that includes rippling keys and a steady pound. BONDAGE OF FATE is, in many ways, more enthralling than Green or NHG; for some reason it just mesmerizes me. Maybe it's the waltz-like rhythm, or the woman's babbling or the choral sounds...all together it's just wonderful! And THE RIGHT SIDE?, well this is another treasure. Giving one final nod to Kraftwerk, it's plinkering keys and ambient chorals easily make the 8.17 minute song seem to flow by in a smooth, relaxing way.<br /><br />That leaves us with SAVE ME, a track added onto the American release and chosen to be the first single. It's a mash-up between Aretha Franklins Save Me and OMDs classic Messages.  It begins with a computerized Messages entrance followed by a voice announcing \\"electronic, solar music\\" and that pretty much explains what comes next. Mash-up is a perfect word for this dance hall, hip, and carelessly fun song.<br /><br />I rarely find a cd that doesn't have at least one song I don't like on it but can honestly say I like, and in more cases than not, LOVE the songs here. I'm a longtime fan of OMD so was hoping for a cd I could casually enjoy while rejoicing in the fact they even reformed and made an attempt at new music.  INSTEAD, I got HoM, an absolutely brilliant piece of work that shows these guys still have it and can stand up to any of their counterparts (and surpass them imho).  I think even newcomers to the world of OMD will embrace the caliber of the music on the release. Don't look at this as a 'come back album' from 'an 80s band' because it's so much more than that! It's proof that Mr. M. and Mr. H., who both really never stopped working, can still create wonderous pieces that stand the test of time and conform to the musical world of today while retaining the elements that ARE OMD.  And with the addition of remaining original members Mal Holmes and Martin Cooper and talks of possibly yet another album to follow, I hope to say these guys are here to stay!  A definite 5 stars from me. Welcome back boys!!!ell this is another treasure.

B001I0T92Q|5.0|The performance of two uSD 16GB cards in this converter dramatically improves write speed performance, over a single actual Sony MSPro Duo.  I'm VERY happy with how this functions and works, and brings lower cost savings on what is a higher cost MSPro Duo solutions (especially when focusing on 16GB uSD cards instead of 32GB MSPro).  Absolutely happy with this!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book by Nicholas Sparks yet! It's not one of his usual sappy love stories, of course it is a love story but there is more to it than that, it's about facing your fears and learning to love again after you have lost a loved one. There is some violence, but it's worth reading, I couldn't put it down!

B003XUKVXK|5.0|This is the long anticipated follow-up, live album, from Kenny Wayne Shepherd, after \\"Ten Days Out, Blues From the Backroads\\" CD/DVD Combo, from a few years back. The clarity of the sound on this CD, is especially good for a live album. The music is \\"rich\\" & \\"deep\\", because you get several, legendary, blues musicians, accompaning Kenny Wayne. The roster of blues musicians include: Hubert Sumlin (a living legend), Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith, Buddy Flett, Bryan Lee, Chris Layton & Tommy Shannon (of SRV's Double Trouble), Noah Hunt, Riley Osburn, and Scott Nelson.    From the beginning to the end, the album is full of excitement and entergy. The Band is really \\"into it\\", and the crowd is definitely loving it. It gives you one of those \\"almost like being there\\", feelings.    Featured tracks include \\"Deja Voodoo\\", \\"Blue on Black\\", and \\"I'm a King Bee\\", but all the songs are great. This is definitely album oriented live music. Kenny Wayne Shepherd is one great, electric, blues guitar player. The liner notes include a great introduction by Kenny Wayne, plus there are photos, of the blues musicians performing on this live cd. Plus, you get some background notes, on the featured legendary blues artists in this CD. You will not be disappointed in this live cd for sure. Thanks!!!

B002E2M5IC|1.0|HIAKU SUMMARY:<br />Why, Coen Brothers,<br />Would you do this to your great<br />filmic legacy?<br /><br />Nothing is worse than an overrated film. Sure, a bad film is pretty bad. But a film that is rated much higher than it deserves certainly is worse in the sense that the film is hyped and has much potential but falters in its ability to deliver.<br /><br />Maybe the Coens just set the bar too high with No Country. That film is untouchable, near flawless. That film was so brilliant that hell, even Fargo and The Big Lebowski, both excellent films, paled in comparison. Sure, Burn After Reading was bad (and they did have, I believe, one clunker before that, which was the hilariously awful Barton Fink), but this goes too far.<br /><br />The only thing even remotely remarkable about the film is the ending, where the school is evacuated due to a tornado warning, and the film's final shot, of the young man watching the oncoming twister, a powerful moment. I'm not saying films have to have tornadoes in them to be good, I just expect a movie to be entertaining, even if it's poorly written. I can forgive a bad movie if its at least entertaining, but this isn't it.<br /><br />The writing is awful. The dialogue seems to be written by an immature 14 year old. Mind you this is the same Coen Brothers that gave us No Country For Old Men, Fargo, Blood Simple, and The Man Who Wasn't There. The editing is sloppy; most of the film consists of people staring for a really long time without dialogue. Granted if you removed all the \\"long stares\\" this film would be about 45-50 minutes long. The characters are all just stereotypes of not just Jewish characters but characters we've seen before (mind you I'm part-Jewish). The acting wasn't too bad, a little wooden at times but I think they did good for the lousy film they had to work on.<br /><br />As for getting a best picture nomination... when No Country won best picture in 2008, I was filled with joy, shouted \\"YES\\", and jumped up and down in happiness. This getting nominated for best picture??? Please, it's in the runnings with Transformers 2: Revenge of the Boring in terms of godawfulness (and I said the same thing about the equally awful \\"The Hurt Locker\\").<br /><br />I've said it once and I'll say it again, people are sheep. That is the only way people like this crap enough to inflate its rating to 7.2/10 on IMDb. I'm sure the \\"art house\\" crowd will tell me how I'm wrong and how I don't get it. But simply put, this film is overrated, pretentious garbage. I thought \\"Burn After Reading\\" was bad but no, this film is awful.ture???

B0043IJ67S|5.0|Classic Clapton right down to the core....Clapton's style comes through as he appears on the cover resembling a Quaker with longer than normal hair as of late and what appears to be a suit/sport coat worn collar up making him look more like a Master sans an expected European scarf, which is exactly what comes through, song-by-song.  Clapton's music is anything but Quaker though as he quickly settles into familiar style from fast-paced blues through slow folk-like tunes sans the folks.  The use of all instruments, along with a mature, familiar and comforting vocals throughout make this familiar Clapton territory which is exactly the way his recent solo concerts have been, familiar, old, new--representing a catalog throughout the decades, how many other can make that claim and are still around to pull it off with such skill and panache?  Not too many, if any.  This a very bluesy compilation that strays a bit off the normal expectations, but one thing we can expect from Clapton is that he anything but normal, more like extraordinary.  Thank goodness someone still know how to do that in today's world of auto-tunes and production facades...may God Bless Clapton as he continues to bless us with his gifts for many, many decades to come!
0345505387|5.0|My first impression of the GN was that Hoang's drawings are absolutely beautiful.  The color and light are amazing...I could go on and on about them.  Yes, they're that gorgeous.  While it was a little difficult to tell some of the characters apart, I was impressed at how wonderfully he depicted expressions, from humorous to quizzical.        As for the content, well, I expected it to be fast-paced and action-packed, without sacrificing Diana's great talent for humor, so I wasn't disappointed at all.  I loved Murtagh's character in OUTLANDER and DIA (his silence always said so much), so I was thrilled to be privy to a few of his adventures and private thoughts.  Thanks Diana!  Who knew so many things were happening in OUTLANDER that Claire was completely unaware of?      Would I rank this up there with Diana's full-length novels?  Well, no, but only because this GN is a completely different format.  I bought it with that knowledge and thoroughly enjoyed it for what it is.
0061537969|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book and really enjoyed it's unique perspective in storytelling - however, people need to be very careful how and to whom they recommend it.    I was first made aware of it in November of 2009 when sitting in Reagan Airport waiting on a flight with my [then] seven year old son.  A woman sat next to us and struck up a conversation in which she highly recommended this book - saying that it would be a great book for my son.    Well, fast forward to September of 2010 and I was going through some old notes and came across this book recommendation and, after reading the Amazon.com summary, ordered it for him.  Luckily, his mother skimmed the book before he was actually given the book (at 8, he's a voracious reader and would have devoured it in a few days time)...and I wish I could go back and box the woman's ears!    I read the book quickly, on a flight between Detroit and Las Vegas and quite enjoyed it.  But a mother dying of cancer, statutory rape...these are not things a child should be reading about in a book and I'm utterly shocked that a person would think it was.    I'm also disappointed that Amazons summary of the book was so benign - there was nothing in it that indicated these things so that I could avoid buying it for my son.    With all that said, Mr. Stein has happened upon a method of telling a story.  I love this dog and his story telling ability.  The story he actually tells could have been interchanged with any of of a million story lines and it wouldn't matter - the dog is the star of this story.    I do recommend this book to any dog lover who has had difficulty in parting with their beloved pet.
0374158460|3.0|I got the audio book on Audible.  I liked the book, but it was too descriptive.  If I read it, I could have scanned over it but had to endure it on the audio version.  It was a good story, just a bit too much.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. I saw it in the theater, and it had me at the edge of my seat. It is not over the top gore, and this may turn some people off to the movie (esp for people who are looking for something along the lines of Saw or Hostel). If you are looking for a suspenseful, scary, paranormal movie then this is probably the movie for you. I can't wait for the sequel to come out. The trailers  give me goosebumps.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I was only a little familiar with the music of Lenoard Cohen when I bought the album after hearing some recommendations from trusted sources, which was  sort of whimsical for me since I tend not to but whole albums without previewing anymore. I'm sure glad I did though, since it made the first experience listening to the album amazing, just like anytime I hear these songs. This is a great concert album (which I usually do not like compared to studio albums) and a great album in general. The extra accompaniment and the credit Lenoard gives is great, and the sincere emotion and quality of music is fantastic.
0307454541|4.0|My friend bought this book months ago and told me to read it.  While perusing through Borders (sorry Amazon) I finally picked up a copy and for the first aproximately 50 to 70 pages I was wondering what all the fuss was about.  BORING.... with a capital B! But then like Viagra...it just took off!!  To the point that it was hard to put down, literally.  Action was splashed all over the place accentuated with an attache of sexual connotations that I swore Stieg had a basement full of harnesses, whips, chains and leather attachments. And after finishing the third novel, my thoughts seem more pragmatic.  It made me wonder if all the notoriety of this book was mainly due to a perverse and closet dominatrix society that we reside in....hmmmm... But anyway, the book captures your attention and the plot is pretty interesting as well, that is, after the first 70 pages. I think all the negative reviews that I have read were mainly due to people who thrive on Shakespeare, have the full collection of Mozart on CD and think Snooki is Snoopy's new dogfriend or something!! (I may be a 'gitter done' type of gal but my favorite TV shows are on the International History Channel, I love all the classics, and traveled all over the world so I am not immune to the 'intellectual society' life.) I thought the book was just plain fun and entertaining and I think that is how you should approach it.  But if you happen to belong in a Convent or believe that Stieg is the antichrist then, well maybe, this may not be the book for you, but hey, just yell out 3 Hail Mary's and you are good to go!;)
B00008972S|5.0|Anyone with knowledge of 1960's cinema knows \\"West Side Story\\", probably one of the greatest movie musicals in history. Everything from Robert Wise's and Jerome Robbin's superb direction to the flawless acting performances of Natalie Wood, Rita Moreno, and Richard Beymer, \\"West Side Story\\" succeeds on all fronts. Featuring a beautiful star-crossed love story set against the backdrop of 1950's New York City gang life, the movie is known for its beautiful score and music. Memorable songs include \\"Maria\\", \\"America\\", and \\"Somewhere\\", and performed with some of the most unforgettable choreography in film.<br /><br /> Winner of an outstanding 10 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1961 the movie made Natalie Wood a boxoffice queen and Rita Moreno a well-sought after actress. The film holds the record as being the only movie musical to garner the most Oscar wins.<br /><br /> This exquiste box set is simply breathtaking. The film has been finally released in its original widescreen format after a paltry DVD barebones release that featured the movie in full frame. Bonuses include a book that houses the film's entire script with rare photographs. Also included are trailers, a \\"West Side Story\\" documentary, and much more. MGM has gone all out on this two DVD set. Thank you!

B000002TYX|5.0|History.  Every non-album studio outtake and rare live gem that career-long Beatles producer George Martin thought was worth keeping.  It should be noted that there are three Anthology two disc sets, two spin-off singles with more unreleased recordings and a DVD boxed set (all sets are available by themselves or in a larger set and can be found right here on Amazon) with rare video footage and current (for that time) interviews of Paul, George, Ringo and George Martin.  Also, released one year after the Anthology sets was Live at The BBC, another two disc set with its own spin-off single with even more unreleased BBC recordings.  Happy hunting...

B003TML0VO|2.0|Two stars for Carlos's musicianship.  Otherwise, terrible.  As the other reviewers have suggested, this represents the worst in the current music business---hype anything just to make a buck. Only a few of these songs are guitar classics, and Carlos's version doesn't make anyone want to forget the originals. Every town has at least 20 bands that can cover these songs, and with the exception of his gift for playing guitar, just as well as the versions on this recording. For a musician of his stature to stoop to this at this point in his career is simply embarassing.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Because this show was on Thursday nights, I never got to watch it and boy was that a wrong move.  This is absolutely my favorite show after watching Season 1.  There are 22 episodes and once you watch the first one, you will be hooked! Yes, it is a teen vampire show, but I am a 54 year old woman who can't get enough of it.  If you like vampire shows or movies, you will love this show.
030726999X|5.0|Loved these books, and was sad to turn the final pages of this thrilling trilogy.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is a story.  A drama.  If you come to the movie expecting epic battle scenes with 2 hours of action, blood, etc then you will be disappointed.  This movie tells a story and it does so rather compellingly.  I enjoyed this and will likely buy the movie.  You need to engage your brain if you want to enjoy this.  This is a thought provoking film.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these to run with because the ear buds always slipped out.  These work well and haven't slipped out at all.  They have gotten wet with sweat and still work fine.  I've used them about 5 times so far.  I recommend them for exercising- especially because of the price.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|A keen political allegory and the director's cut is well-crafted in all respects.  I didn't see this at the theater but I'll buy my ticket as soon as I can if they should be a sequel of Robin Hood with Blanchett, Crow and made by Ridely Scott.  I added the blu-ray director's cut to my permanent DVD library.<br /><br />In this movie (and in places not far away)  myopic leaders have betrayed England by invading the world, forgetting their history and culture, and in borrowing against their future so they are now in hock to other nations who of course have ambitions and interests of their own and are a threat to the sovereignty of England.<br /><br />In Scott's movie, King Richard the Lionheart has bankrupted England with his military adventuring in Muslim lands. Whilst Richard's brother and rival, the weak but cunning King John, makes a naïve alliance with a rapacious French king and then sets about to gather every last coin from the poor families of England.  But as it's as it's told to Robin, the freemen rise and rise again, until lambs become lions.<br /><br />Sound familiar?

B0040T7CFS|4.0|PRELUDE<br /><br />This enormous box set is a veritable treasure trove of music by Bach!  I've been a devoted Bach fan since my teenage years and have owned recordings of most of the important instrumental works for awhile.  But I was still largely unfamiliar with Bach's vast corpus of sacred and secular vocal works (filling 94 CDs or about 60% of this set).  I've long wanted to collect all of Bach's works but the task of tracking down good recordings of every piece without too much overlap seemed daunting and expensive.  Now I have nearly all of Bach's surviving music at my fingertips, and the feeling is indescribable!<br /><br />The latest version of Brilliant Classics' Bach Complete Edition (BCE) brings several new recordings and other new material together in an incredibly priced box set.  Not every recording in this set is a winner, but there are several really great discs and most of the rest are decent to good.  Nearly all of the recordings are good enough to serve as \\"reference copies\\" for Bach's music. While most of the set is played on period instruments and using small to medium-size ensembles, there are recordings here for almost every taste in performance style.  People who strongly dislike an historical approach to Bach will probably want to consider the [[ASIN:B003LR4QPE H&auml;nssler Bach set]] instead, but note that it is about twice the cost of this one.<br /><br />The BCE is reasonably comprehensive but there are some missing compositions and I doubt many people will be content with every recording included here.  So, you will still have some collecting to do after buying this set but don't let that alone dissuade you.  If your Bach collection is missing at least half of the music in this set like mine was, then the BCE is by far the easiest and most affordable way to fill in the gaps with decent recordings.<br /><br />The rest of this review presents a very detailed look at what is included in the Bach Complete Edition and gives my impressions of many of the individual performances.<br /><br />OVERVIEW<br /><br />This is at least the third version of Brilliant Classics' [[ASIN:B000HRME5U Bach Edition]] and this 2010 release features a redesigned box and cardboard sleeves for the discs.  This release adds 2 CDs for the St. Mark Passion plus 2 DVDs of the St. Matthew and St. John Passions.  Most importantly however, BC has replaced several of the \\"lower quality\\" recordings with new ones (see below) making this the best version of their Bach Edition to date.<br /><br />The 157 CDs include 3234 tracks covering about 1042 unique compositions plus a number of duplicates (see below).  All together, the set features 6 days, 16 hours, 19 minutes of music! (160 hrs.)<br /><br />The DVD-ROM contains 500+ pages of program notes and texts for the vocal works in PDF format. The CDs are now numbered 1-157 instead of being grouped into \\"Volumes\\".  The program notes have not been updated since previous releases so they still use the old numbering scheme and there are no translations of the German or Latin texts, but they are still very informative.  Another new addition is the inclusion of 16,800 pages of music scores in PDF format on the DVD-ROM.  This is a digitized copy of the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe scores in 46 volumes, published from 1851-1899 and now in the public domain.  These are extremely nice to have but buyers should be aware that pieces discovered since that time are not included.<br /><br />The set is very well organized into sections for orchestral & chamber works, keyboard, sacred cantatas (in two 30 CD sections), other vocal works, and organ.  CDs vary in length from about 38 to nearly 80 minutes in length, so they could have squeezed the set onto fewer discs, but I am very glad that they didn't! In the first five sections, each disc (or 2-4 discs) contains all of the tracks for a work or set of related works (Brandenburgs, Violin Concertos, Goldberg Variations, etc.) so you don't have to hunt for thingsand only works longer than one CD are split across discs.  In the organ works, important collections like the Orgelbuchlein and Leipzig Chorales are grouped together but otherwise they are organized into nice \\"programs\\" of several different types of pieces (eg. an opening Prelude & Fugue, some chorales, a concerto or trio sonata, more chorales, and a \\"big finisher\\").<br /><br />The box is sturdy enough in my opinion if you treat it gently.  The new sleeves are much more uniform in appearance than previous versions and feature a simple background pattern (in a different color for each section) without artwork.  Complete track listings and performing credits appear only on the sleeves (not on the DVD).  The inside lid of the box does contain a helpful short title for each disc (although the organ CDs only list BWV numbers here).<br /><br />Probably the most useful addition to this set would be several indices of the entire contents by title, BWV, and CD & track numbers.  I am in the process of creating some of these indices myself and I will probably post the documents on my web site when finished. ([...])<br /><br />WHAT'S INCLUDED<br /><br />Naturally, all of Bach's major instrumental and vocal works are included in this set.  The vast majority of these are performed with \\"period instruments\\" and many were recorded specifically for this set.  Most of the performers were previously unfamiliar to me but there are a few that I recognized like Jaap ter Linden (Cello Suites), Bob van Asperen (English Suites), Michel Corboz (Motets), and Hans Fagius (organ works).<br /><br />Many familiar names also appear in the St. Matthew and St. John Passions which are directed by Stephen Cleobury leading the Choir of King's College (Cambridge) and the Brandenburg Consort with Roy Goodman.  Roy Goodman directs the European Union Baroque Orchestra and Ring Ensemble of Finland for the St. Mark Passion.  Rogers Covey-Crump is the evangelist for Ss. Matthew and Mark, and John Mark Ainsley takes that role in the St. John.  Michael George, Stephen Richardson, and Gordon Jones are the three \\"Christs\\".  Other soloists include Emma Kirkby (Matthew), Catherine Bott (John), Michael Chance (Matthew & John), etc.<br /><br />The spurious St. Luke Passion which was included in [[ASIN:B000ERU928 Bach Edition: Complete Works [Box Set]]] is not included in the 2010 Bach Complete Edition.<br /><br />As far as I can tell from online information, replacement recordings since the original Bach Edition include the B minor Mass and Christmas Oratorio (Diego Fasolis: Coro Della Radio Svizzera, 1997 & 2003), the Magnificat (Vienna State Opera Chorus and Orchestra, 1957), the violin concertos (Dmitry Sitkovetsky: English Chamber Orchestra) and cello suites (Jaap ter Linden, 2006).  Also, there are new 2006 recordings by Pieter-Jan Belder and Musica Amphion of the Brandenburg concertos and the concertos for two and three harpsichords as well as 2008 recordings by Belder of the Well-Tempered Clavier.  Based on samples from the earlier Editions that I've been able to listen to here on Amazon, some of these replacements are definite improvements!<br /><br />Jed Wentz and Michael Borgstede replaced Preston/Pinnock/Savall for the flute sonatas which also resulted in some changes to the contents of the set.  The Preston recording included BWV 1031 and 1033 (considered doubtful by some scholars) but the new recording does not.  The new recording also adds a second copy of two Trio Sonatas (1038 & 1039 on two flutes) and the Musical Offering.  While I am glad to have alternate interpretations of these pieces, I am a little disappointed that 1031, 1033, and 1020 are not included in the set.  You can find all three of these pieces on a recording by Janet See: [[ASIN:B0001XP1UU Bach: Flute Sonatas, Vol. 2]].<br /><br />As a nice bonus, a couple of the speculative concerto reconstructions are included:  1064R for three violins and two recordings of 1060R for violin and oboe.  The second copy of 1060R is incorrectly labeled as the Concerto for Oboe d'Amore, 1055R which is not included in this set, but was perhaps intended to be.<br /><br />Regarding the \\"completeness\\" of the BCE, there are a few caveats to be aware of.  First, don't expect this set to simply contain every piece in the Schmieder catalog, from BWV 1 to 1128.  Some of those pieces are lost or incomplete and an increasing number of them are now attributed to other composers or are considered of doubtful authenticity by modern scholars.  Some of the doubtful pieces are included but many are not.  There are also variant versions available for many pieces and this Brilliant Classics collection includes about 13 of them such as Cantatas 36c and 82a, but this is nowhere near exhaustive.  However, don't worry, about thirty-odd, well-known spurious works such as the Eight Little Preludes & Fugues for organ (553-560) and the ever-popular Minuets in G from the Anna Magdelena Notebook were not left out.<br /><br />Second, even considering the above, this \\"Bach Complete Edition\\" is still missing a few authentic Bach compositions.  The first Bach Edition was assembled between 1998 and 2000, so pieces discovered since then are not included (BWV 1121 to 1128 and several without numbers).  These are mostly 4-part chorales and organ pieces.  You can find the new organ pieces on the Block M Records website. (They offer very good recordings by James Kibbie of Bach's complete organ works for free!)<br /><br />Among the minor works that are included are the songs and arias from the Schemellis Gesangbuch, the Anna Magdelena Notebook, etc.  Only a few of these are missing.  Additionally, 304 of Bach's four-part chorale harmonizations are collected together on 6.5 CDs and mostly grouped by melody for handy reference.  138 of these are taken from Bach's cantatas and passions, so there are two recordings of each in the BCE set, but it is very nice to have them in both places.  Unfortunately, about 26 of the independent chorales with their own BWV numbers are not included for reasons that remain a mystery to me.<br /><br />Bach arranged or augmented a number of pieces by other composers.  Included here are the complete transcriptions of concertos for harpsichord or organ, plus most of the sonatas and trios Bach transcribed for keyboard. The Suite in A major for violin & harpsichord after Weiss (1025) is not included.  Bach's \\"parody\\" of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater (1083) is included but not the Credo (1081) or Suscepit Israel (1082) that he composed to augment music by Bassani and Caldara.<br /><br />Most of the canons are here including the 14 canons on the Goldberg Aria (1087) but the \\"Canon concordia discors\\" (1086) is missing.<br /><br />Also missing are Gloria in excelsis Deo (BWV 191), three Sancti (237, 239 & 240), the four German motets from the earlier version of the Magnificat (243a), the Fugue in G minor for violin and harpsichord (1026), the Trio in F (1040), an aria for bass (1088), a few keyboard and organ pieces (896, 921, 956, 1085) and a few others depending on what you consider \\"authentic\\".<br /><br />WHAT'S GOOD<br /><br />I've had this set for about a month now and have listened to just over half of the material.  There are several really great recordings, a couple of mediocre ones, and the balance are decent to good.  Overall, I'd give 3.5 stars for the quality of the performances.<br /><br />Note: Since opinions vary widely on what constitutes a \\"good Bach performance\\", let me tell you what my biases are.  I prefer Baroque instruments except that I probably slightly prefer the piano to the harpsichord.  I like both historic organs and modern ones if they are voiced clearly.  Boys choirs or mixed choruses are fine.  Regardless, I am very picky about tuning and vibrato.  My ideal Bach vocalist has a light, lyrical voice with just a hint of vibrato.  I can accept moderate vibratos if they don't affect tuning or clarity but Bach with heavy \\"operatic\\" vibratos is not for me.<br /><br />The first thing I listened to was the Christmas Oratorio (Diego Fasolis: Coro Della Radio Svizzera) and I was very impressed from the first lightning fast chorus through to the last jubilant chorale.  The medium-size choir sounds full while remaining nimble and the female sopranos and altos sing in-tune.  The instrumentalists and soloists are all pretty good too, with Klaus Mertens and an uncredited trumpetist giving a rousing \\"Grosser Herr\\".  I doubt I'll need another recording of this piece.  Most of the same performers give an excellent rendition of the Mass in B minor too.<br /><br />The three Passions are also very good.  The Choir of King's College sounds \\"bigger\\" but the DVDs reveal them to be about the same size as the Holland Boys' Choir.  In the St. Matthew, Rogers Covey-Crump is a perfect evangelist and Emma Kirkby and Michael Chance blend beautifully on their duet.  The boys choir is occasionally out of tune but it is not too distracting.  I don't really care for Michael George as Christus in the St. Matthew: he is much more dramatic than the other soloists and sounds a little out of place.  I guess I didn't really like most of the basses in all three passions, but the other soloists are quite good (especially Emma Kirkby and Catherine Bott).  All three passions utilize countertenors for the alto parts and the St. Mark has a boy \\"treble\\" for the soprano solos, but it also has a smaller chorus with women.<br /><br />All of the sacred cantatas plus the Ascension Oratorio and \\"Tilge, H&ouml;chster, meine S&uuml;nden\\" (BWV 1083) are performed by the Holland Boys' Choir and the Netherlands Bach Collegium under the direction of Pieter Jan Leusink.  These are small-scale performances and, overall, I think they are very successful and listenable.  The bulk of the cantatas are made up of arias, chorales, and simpler choruses which all receive respectable performances.  The soloists are also generally very good.  In one notable exception, I find countertenor Sytse Buwalda, who sings all of the alto solos, to be rather disappointing due to problems with tone and intonation.  Marjon Strijk is occasionally unsteady but she sounds like a decent boy soprano much of the time.  Ruth Holton (soprano) and Bas Ramselaar (bass) are very solid and the three tenors pass muster.  The variety of authentic instruments used is astounding and a real pleasure to hear.  The only real problems are in the more difficult choruses (see below).<br /><br />One of the surprises of the BCE is how good the chorale collection is.  There is lots of variety in the instrumental and vocal forces used and some interesting programming choices regarding texts and the ordering of the chorales.  You still may not want to listen to an entire CD of these at once but they are far from boring and make great material for shuffling or programming your own playlists.<br /><br />Among the new Brandenburg concerto recordings, nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 are good, especially no. 6.  Some people complained about the use of a natural horn in the original Bach Edition to play the trumpet part of Brandenburg no. 2 an octave lower.  This new Musica Amphion version has a real natural trumpet, but the trumpet playing doesn't always sound clean to me.  Most of the non-Brandenburg concertos are decently played but certainly not definitively.  Sound quality is a little variable.<br /><br />One of the true gems of the BCE is Jaap ter Linden's excellent interpretations of the Cello Suites (especially no. 6).  His playing is expressive and sensitive to the subtleties of the score.  You will never need another copy of the cello suites but do yourself a favor and check out Janos Starker and Anner Bylsma too!<br /><br />The Wentz/Borgstede flute sonatas are exciting and perhaps even better than the Preston, Pinnock and Savall recording that used to be in the Bach Edition.  I've enjoyed most of the other included chamber music too although I have favorite recordingsfor much of it already.  The lute works, canons, both versions of the Musical Offering, Viola da Gamba and Trio Sonatas in this set will probably see a lot of play.<br /><br />The Goldberg Variations, Well-Tempered Clavier, and Clavierubung II (Pieter-Jan Belder) are all played and recorded very well.  Bob van Asperen's English Suites are pretty good.  The seven Toccatas played by Menno van Delft are very thoughtfully performed and sound excellent on the harpsichord.  The Art of Fugue is OK on the harpsichord but I think it would have been more successful as chamber music or on the organ.  There were so many unique keyboard instruments in the Baroque that I was thinking it was a shame all of the works in this set are played on harpsichord until I discovered that a few of the pieces from the Anna Magdalena Notebook are played on clavichord!<br /><br />An an organist, I already had two cycles of Bach's organ music plus many miscellaneous recordings.  In my opinion, Hans Fagius' organ performances are top notch!  They are recorded well too and the selection of six historical Swedish instruments is fantastic.  Though the program notes discuss the instruments, they will not satisfy organ buffs who will want each instruments' specifications too.  A few of the organ works are the only place in the BCE that I have clearly heard the unequal temperament (keyboard tuning) that would have been common in Bach's day.<br /><br />I haven't watched the Passion DVDs completely yet, but they are well done, presenting both pieces as straightforward performances without commentary.  Multiple cameras appear to have been used and they cut to and from the various soloists and instrumentalists at well-cued times.  The St. John DVD presents the 1725 version of the work.  This confused me at first because the opening chorus is different and the DVD menu had the usual \\"Herr, unser Herrscher\\" listed for the title.  In the end, being able not just to hear, but to watch some of the music being performed adds yet another way to experience Bach to this set that some people may find illuminating.<br /><br />WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD<br /><br />The Magnificat (Vienna State Opera Chorus and Orchestra) is easily the worst recording in the set.  The chorus and soloists are too operatic (in a bad way) and their \\"Germanized\\" pronunciation of Latin is irritating (the Missae Breves have similar pronunciation).  A couple of movements feature prominently an untuned or unmaintained pipe organ that is definitely not \\"period\\" (nor do the other instruments sound like they are except possibly the trumpets which \\"splat\\" like bad natural trumpets).  Listening on headphones reveals inconsistencies in equalization between tracks, odd mixing effects, and even a couple of tracks that sound like the left and right channels are out of sync.  The entire effect can be quite dreadful at times.  But since this is one of Bach's best works, you'll probably want to own a couple of other recordings anyways.<br /><br />The instrumental playing on the Easter Oratorio is quite good but the soloists shriek, \\"huff and puff\\" unmusically, and are generally too operatic for my taste.  In contrast, the soloists for the secular cantatas are also very operatic, but they are still very musical most of the time.  Even if the singing is not my cup of tea, I cannot deny that it is good.  And after all, these pieces are the closest that Bach wrote to opera.<br /><br />In the sacred cantatas, the Holland Boys' Choir is OK much of the time for simple parts but more difficult passages can be a mess.  Both the sopranos and the altos are occasionally very flat throughout a movement to the point that it almost sounds like they are singing parallel minor seconds.  Thankfully, Bach knew the limitations of boy's choirs too and he generally writes parts that they can handle.  But these performers fill 62 CDs of the BCE, so if you don't care for what you hear in the samples, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />A fewof the solo harpsichord recordings were not engineered very well and the instruments can sound a little bright and harsh at times.  The French Suites have the poorest sound quality in this regard, bordering on painful to listen to.  Their performances are rather uninspired much of the time too.<br /><br />A few other recordings, such as the motets and 3rd orchestral suite, have less than ideal sound quality but they are not unlistenable.  Even though the violin concertos in this set replaced the ones in the original Bach Edition, the performances are still just so-so.  And the Schemellis Gesangbuch gets a little repetitive with the same soloist and organ on every song, but the performances themselves are thoughtful.<br /><br />Which brings me to a few production errors (or bad judgements?) in the set.  The two Schemellis Gesangbuch discs group multiple works onto each track.  There are 68 distinct works on these CDs and they are numbered correctly on the back of the sleeves, but the music is really only divided into 18 tracks.  Unfortunately, the same problem afflicts the Orgelbuchlein: 36 chorale preludes are combined into only 13 tracks making it very difficult to listen to just one.  I also found that two of the chorale tracks on discs 135 & 138 contain identical audio.  They are labeled the same, but I suspect a different chorale was supposed to be on one of those tracks.  For a set of this size, I've noticed very few misprints in the track listings and there are no major errors such that any of the CDs could be considered defective.  (There is some silence in the middle of disc 14, track 5, the Flute Sonata in A BWV 1032 - 1. Vivace, but I think that may be intentional because part of the original score for this piece is missing).<br /><br />FUGUE<br /><br />In conclusion, the Bach Complete Edition contains an incredible wealth of decent recordings of music by (arguably) the most profound composer in Western music history.  I plan on thoroughly exploring the cantatas, passions, and oratorios over the coming months.  And I mix in appropriate chorales and organ works to enhance my experience of the sacred choral works.  Nearly all of the instrumental works will certainly find themselves in the daily rotation of my listening.  Out of 157 CDs, I would say that only about 4 of them are bad enough that I will avoid listening to them.<br /><br />There are several alternatives to this Brilliant Classics set for building a library of Bach, but this is by far the most affordable method.  I can imagine that someday, I might possibly invest in the  [[ASIN:B000RZOR2U Harnoncourt/Leonhardt Sacred Cantatas]] or [[ASIN:B003647BUE John Elliot Gardiner Sacred Masterpieces]] sets to get different versions of some of the vocal works.  But the newer cantata series by [[ASIN:B000005EEI Ton Koopman]] or [[ASIN:B0000016N6 Suzuki]] are way out of my reach, as is the out of print [[ASIN:B00001IV8B Bach 2000: The Complete Bach Edition]].  Many other people may consider [[ASIN:B003LR4QPE The H&auml;nssler Complete Works of Johann Sebastian Bach - Bachakademie 10th Anniversary Special Collection]] which is also very reasonably priced and possibly more complete than the BCE.  But I am not really interested in Helmuth Rilling's cantata recordings which use modern instruments and choruses.<br /><br />So, is the Bach Complete Edition for you?  Listen to some samples now that they are available and use the information here to help you decide.  Personally, I am thrilled to have this set.chorale.  The medium-size choir sounds full while remaining nimble and the female sopranos and altos sing in-tune.  The instrumentalists and soloists are all pretty good too, with Klaus Mertens and an uncredited trumpetist giving a rousing \\"Grosser Herr\\".  I doubt I'll need another recording of this piece.  Most of the same performers give an excellent rendition of the Mass in B minor too.    The three Passions are also very good.  The Choir of King's College sounds \\"bigger\\" but the DVDs reveal them to be about the same size as the Holland Boys' Choir.  In the St. Matthew, Rogers Covey-Crump is a perfect evangelist and Emma Kirkby and Michael Chance blend beautifully on their duet.  The boys choir is occasionally out of tune but it is not too distracting.  I don't really care for Michael George as Christus in the St. Matthew: he is much more dramatic than the other soloists and sounds a little out of place.  I guess I didn't really like most of the basses in all three passions, but the other soloists are quite good (especially Emma Kirkby and Catherine Bott).  All three passions utilize countertenors for the alto parts and the St. Mark has a boy \\"treble\\" for the soprano solos, but it also has a smaller chorus with women.    All of the sacred cantatas plus the Ascension Oratorio and \\"Tilge, Höchster, meine Sünden\\" (BWV 1083) are performed by the Holland Boys' Choir and the Netherlands Bach Collegium under the direction of Pieter Jan Leusink.  These are small-scale performances and, overall, I think they are very successful and listenable.  The bulk of the cantatas are made up of arias, chorales, and simpler choruses which all receive respectable performances.  The soloists are also generally very good.  In one notable exception, I find countertenor Sytse Buwalda, who sings all of the alto solos, to be rather disappointing due to problems with tone and intonation.  Marjon Strijk is occasionally unsteady but she sounds like a decent boy soprano much of the time.  Ruth Holton (soprano) and Bas Ramselaar (bass) are very solid and the three tenors pass muster.  The variety of authentic instruments used is astounding and a real pleasure to hear.  The only real problems are in the more difficult choruses (see below).    One of the surprises of the BCE is how good the chorale collection is.  There is lots of variety in the instrumental and vocal forces used and some interesting programming choices regarding texts and the ordering of the chorales.  You still may not want to listen to an entire CD of these at once but they are far from boring and make great material for shuffling or programming your own playlists.     Among the new Brandenburg concerto recordings, nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 are good, especially no. 6.  Some people complained about the use of a natural horn in the original Bach Edition to play the trumpet part of Brandenburg no. 2 an octave lower.  This new Musica Amphion version has a real natural trumpet, but the trumpet playing doesn't always sound clean to me.  Most of the non-Brandenburg concertos are decently played but certainly not definitively.  Sound quality is a little variable.    One of the true gems of the BCE is Jaap ter Linden's excellent interpretations of the Cello Suites (especially no. 6).  His playing is expressive and sensitive to the subtleties of the score.  You will never need another copy of the cello suites but do yourself a favor and check out Janos Starker and Anner Bylsma too!

B001VNB54A|5.0|Can't wait for this to arrive on Blu-Ray. The series does a remarkable job of staying true to Eugene Sledge's \\"With the Old Breed,\\" and shows a lot about a war that is often looked upon as less romantic when compared to the European Theater.  Anyone who has read Sledge's book (one of the two main books used as a basis for the series) knows that a lot of the \\"racist\\" things shown in the series actually happened. American soldiers hated the Japanese and did some pretty horrific things to them throughout the war, as Japanese did some horrific things to US boys.  Some people who have reviewed on here act as if any soldier who has ever fought for the US is a certified saint, and is incapable of doing such atrocities. They would rather we be fed the same propaganda films the country got in the 1940's then to watch a series for historical and entertainment purposes.  Please don't let other peoples' political views persuade you from watching a great series.
B003YNFAWI|5.0|Shah Rukh plays an autistic man who has come from India to USA to live with his brother.  He plays this role in an understated and completely believable way. Kajol is his love interest and as usual gives a splendid performance.  After 9/11 Khan (who is a Muslim) is suspected of being a terrorist and is very poorly treated by the authorities which leads him to travel across the USA to meet the President to explain that he is not a terrorist.  He hears about Cyclone Katrina and goes back to help the people there who were very kind to him on his travels.  At this point the film becomes a little schmaltzy and slow, however the point it makes is very valid and clear.  The ending is well done and unexpected.  I first watched this movie without English subtitles and followed it fairly well.  I was thrilled with the blu-ray DVD and the subtitles were excellent. This is a film I will watch over and over again.  10 out of 10.
0553805371|4.0|It's a wondrous world we live in and from the macroscopic view of galaxies to the microscopic view of subatomic particles we can appreciate its intricacy and beauty. But the question that has haunted philosophers and scientists for millennia has remained...Why something rather than nothing?<br /><br />How did the universe begin?...Why are we here?...What is the nature of reality?...Does the apparent design of the universe point to a designer? With deep scientific insight, incisive clarity, wonderful illustrations, and a great sense of wit, Drs. Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow give us the secular physicist's take on the answers.<br /><br />The Grand Design - the title itself admits that the universe as we know it carries an appearance of design. And, as Hawking acknowledges, based on these circumstances its seems reasonable to believe in a Designer, i.e. God. However, it is the goal of The Grand Design to show that there need not be any Grand Designer. Covering topics such as the nature of reality, alternative histories, scientific laws, and general and special relativity, Hawking and Mlodinow manage to write on what I would call an \\"advanced layperson\\" level. While they eschew the technical language of their professions, the very concepts they are discussing require a good amount of skill and concentration to understand.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I found myself agreeing with much of what Hawking had to say. He first argued that scientific laws exist and mentions medieval Christian theologians who thought differently, yet such an argument is hardly effective in removing a Designer because virtually no theologian holds such a theory today. It is perfectly rational to believe that the laws of the universe were instituted by an omniscient God, and the precision of such laws should lend credence to his existence.<br /><br />Next, he discusses the nature of reality, reminding readers that we view the universe from a subjective perspective - or inside the fishbowl, if you will. Because of this perspective, what he terms a model-dependent realism, he concludes that many divergent theories comes to different conclusions by viewing the same evidence from a different perspective. Again, I completely agree. In fact, one might say that I am a theist and Hawking an atheist because of our different model-dependent perspectives of realism. Through this, Hawking is drawing out the conclusion that the God-perspective can seem correct, but not be.<br /><br />The third thing to discuss from here is his admittance of design and a discussion of the M-theory. With this, he holds that design can be explained away because of the existence of possible worlds with other sets of laws. Thus, we happen to inhabit the one universe of nearly an infinitude that has made life possible for us.<br /><br />Hawking has still not overcome the high hurdle of how the universe began. While the Theory of Everything explain design, it doesn't explain existence (perhaps Theory of Everything is a bad term, then?). Existence, Hawking holds, is due to gravity. Yes, gravity. I'm going to quote Hawking here:<br /><br />  \\"Because there is a law like gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing...Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God...\\" (pg. 180)<br /><br />You'll have to read the book to understand how he came to this conclusion, as his thoughts on gravity and its effect of space and time take up a considerable amount of space. However, I don't see how this solves Hawking's problem as he is either presuming that gravity existed causally prior to mass or that gravity was spontaneously created as well. If he assumes gravity's causally prior existence, he has either pushed the question back to the origin of gravity or is positing gravity as the ultimate first cause. If he assumes that gravity was created spontaneously, then he is left withoutevidence or reason for this and is contradicting his own theory. If something created gravity, what is it something and can we posit it as God? And if gravity is the ultimate first cause, then he is in effect describing God in clunky yet effective ontological means. In any case, the possibility of a Creator is not escaped completely.<br /><br />In the end, Hawking and Mlodinow present an accessible technical argument for the universe's existence apart from God. Wonderfully written, The Great Design masterfully accomplishes everything it set out to do - except convince me of its arguments. The arguments are laid out clearly, and I credit Hawking for giving theism a bit of credibility and respect through the book.<br /><br />Nonetheless, and I say this with the greatest respect for Dr. Hawking's brilliance, but his conclusions are flawed because he remains biased on his premises. He resorts to complex models to explain away God's nonexistence cosmologically, but even then he cannot disentangle himself from arguments of morality (he assumes objective morality) or ontology (he presupposes gravity). What a great deal of faith must go into this! For myself personally, I would conclude - along with former celebrated atheist Antony Flew as well as a number of Christian physicists - that we must follow the evidence wherever it leads. And such evidence points to a Creator.ry. If something created gravity, what is it something and can we posit it as God?

B001RCD2DW|5.0|If you consider yourself an audiophile or a real lover of music this is the perfect headphone.  They are absolutely wonderful and deliver no coloration in the sound, very neutral.   They also produce a magic stereo image with the exact dose of bass  so you get all details.   This headphone are very musical and you will enjoy as never before all your cd's and LPs.  You will hear new details and presence as if you where standing in the studio. Exactly the way musicians and producers hear their final product.  Voices are the most natural and precise that I have never heard from a headphone.  Now are they better than Sennheiser HD 650 ?  the answer is YES for the musical aspect.  Compare to the Grado SR325i they have more precision details are equal. Plus the fact that this cans are very comfortable.  Are they better to  the Grado GS1000 with a price of $1300 ?  no.  BUT equal for the enjoyable aspect.   Finally this headphone are made for studio producer to work on their final mix. So it means they have supreme comfort. Along with strong and very nice construction.  Plus a real IMPORTANT aspect it's that the sound is not to loud from them and this is to protect your hearing for long period of listening.  Im not saying they can not play loud and rock. You will have to turn  more the volume compare with others. Sure you need as all good heaphones a amp to power them plus 200 hundreds hours for \\"burning\\" them. Like a very good set of speakers they sound better and better with time.   You must also know that they are not \\"design\\" for listening TV/cinema or play games. They are made for music and it's what they deliver PURE MUSIC ! For every kind Rock-progressive-jazz-classic-opera.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !

The extras begin as soon as you open the box, with an ancient game featured in the series, that you must work out the rules to, hidden compartments, secret codes, invisible ink revealed by provided UV light. An experience, and an absolute must have for fans.

B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|I found this movie to be a great ride down the old horror tales of Vampires and  Bats. Movies are supposed to be Entertainment. When I hear people saying that it is full of fake blood I know that what these people want to put real blood on the screen. Whatever happened to just sitting back and enjoying a movie for what it is. to take us to a place that we can be in for a short period of time. How many of us listen to what a movie critic says about a movie and we go see it anyway only to find out that we like this movie more then the critic. What would this critic say about a movie that you just made. watch a movie to enjoy a movie not to pick it apart and say to the rest of us that you didn't like it becuase they didn't use real blood. you wan real blood. watch the news. you want entertainment listen to congress. you want imagination. then watch a movie. I thank you.

0143034901|5.0|Really well written and interesting!  Great character development and the translation really works!  A great bookclub book... the over 500 pages shouldn't intimidate. They really fly!
0553573403|4.0|Having read this book more than once, one thing that I'm pretty unsure as to is why this book/series never got the attention that so many other series have got. George R.R Martin I am pretty convinced has a very dark and brilliant mind, for him to conjure up something this truly \\"DARK\\". There are many things to like in this book and many things to dislike in this book in my opinion.<br /><br />Since most the reviews are singing praises to this book, I will state the things I didn't like about it. For one, there is scarcely any decent character in his book that lives long enough for you to care enough who lives. Further, the sordid descriptions of incest, brutality, sexual assault and other perversity are passed off as common-place which can be quite disconcerting at time. Deceit, treachery, trickery, conspiring murder and other nefarious activities are quite often rewarded and characters who resort to these activities as their way of life are rewarded, lucky and shown as clever and capable. Characters who are bound by Honor, morality, civility and most of all Justice are always shown to meet untimely ends and face death, defeat and humiliation. The greatest points for me in this book were the parts where minutia about training, contests, etc took place. I found them to be less tedious to read as there was little mention of the constant plotting, the casual brutality, the incest, the rape, the scheming and of course the detailed description of a multitude of sexual acts.<br /><br />If you were to ask, is the story interesting ? I would have to truthfully answer; YES. If you were to ask, if it was a nice read, I have to say; NO. While, George R.R Martin might think he is being clever and scandalous by casually killing of important characters that he makes the readers invest in, while he rewards those whom people tend to despise, I find, that it only works the first few times to enhance the suspense. After which, it becomes quite tediously annoying. Some of the characters are also rather 2-dimensional and without really believable personalities. However, the next book in this series is remarkable better.<br /><br />I would over all rate this book as Good or a 4/5 .ather 2-dimensional and without really believable personalities.

0307594777|4.0|A really enjoyable series, too bad there are only three. Having it set in Sweden makes it all a little different. There is no catering to a foreign audience. If you want to know locations - Google Map it. The stories are interesting, intriguing and involved. The most important part is how the characters draw you in and leave you wanting more. Too bad the movies are not able to match the characters in your head.
0226264211|2.0|Ah yes.  I was one of the first in-line for this book when it originally came out.  I had just been thoroughly indoctrinated/programmed by a few professors who had studied under Friedman.  My programming was at the University of Washington which was but one of two West Coast universities that would hire Chicago PhDs.  (This is what I was told at the time, UCLA was the other one.)  I was older than the any of the three or four Chicago profs (who made up a significant percentage of staff for 200 level and above courses at the time) as I was attending school under the G I Bill and they were all brand new grads (and therefore draft avoiders too).  The book review has a statement from Newsweek and claims \\"\\"Milton Friedman is one of the nation's outstanding economists, distinguished for remarkable analytical powers and technical virtuosity. He is unfailingly enlightening, independent, courageous, penetrating, and above all, stimulating.\\"  Unfortunately - even though Milton got a Nobel Prize for economics, he never once claimed to be an economist because, he had no training in economics - by his own admission.  He called himself an \\"empiricist\\" having been trained in mathematics.    This book is a Libertarian bible based on completely free markets with no government control of anything.  Milton states in this book that if you wish to be a doctor you should be able to put up your shingle and practice medicine regardless of your education level, training, or lack thereof and should not be tested by any agency in practicing medicine.  That is basically the book.  This book is the antitheses of Keynes \\"General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\\" (which Milton promoted for years) - which I have also read and is not at all what libertarians and \\"conservatives\\" make it out to be.  Milton proposes a monetary only policy, which was written well before the proliferation of short term credit and credit cards, certificates of deposit, and other instruments which make it next toimpossible to control the money supply.  In my education I had to pass a written \\"core\\" economics program test (after taking the core economic subjects in graduate school) which was reviewed by five professors, two of which were the brand new Chicago professors, and a couple of socialist leaning profs.  It was tricky answering questions that would satisfy the entire review board, but was able to do it - first try.  My point is that I know Milton's core beliefs and disbeliefs, I had to in order to get my MA - which I did.  What I learned in my five years of study at U of W is that like so many libertarians, what Milton taught and what he wrote about were exact opposites.  The stories coming out of Chicago were that you had to think just like he did in order to get your PhD is not a lie.  The stories of PhD candidates being verbally trashed by Milton during orals and sent back to rework their thinking are famously told and retold.  Milton is dogmatic in his \\"economic\\" belief system and if you didn't believe the way he did, you didn't get your degree.  This is libertarianism?  This is how one is taught to think for themselves at the university level?  These same dogmatic views were retained by his PhDs who taught me, and quite frankly, it fit my views at the time.    I have a great deal of respect for Milton to this day.  He is one of the few who could present what we now consider to be conservative arguments against the liberal view in a rational manner.  (I also miss the rational, well thought out reasoning behind William F. Buckley Jr.'s arguments too.)   Unfortunately it was under Milton's role as economic advisor to Ronald Reagan that we began the national economic atrophy we find ourselves in today.  For the first time in U. S. history the incomes of the wealthy has outpaced the incomes of those at or near the poverty line, and it all began under Reagan.  Up to that time - from 1776 until the 1980s the incomes of those on the low end of the ladder was headed toward the wealthy.  Not anymore.  It all began with Milton, and if it continues it will tear this country apart.  If you're a libertarian, read the book.  If you're a realist, find something else.  I do have to give it at least two stars because the author has for the first time brought real economics to the masses - and this is his greatest book.  Anyone can understand this book.  Keynes' book is rather tough to get through - even though it still applies to this very day.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|One of the advantages of ages, experience and yes, money is that you can do whatever you want and if folks don't like it they can go to hell.  For 35 years fans have wanted Clapton to recreate Cream or the Derek and the Dominos record and have been unhappy when he didn't.  As Clapton has moved through his 60's he seems to be becoming more comfortable in his own skin and doing the music he wants to.  Based on the track listing for this CD it sure seems to be the case, and in doing that he has done his best work in many years.<br /><br />The new disc, Clapton, has Eric playing old blues songs and standards.  Blues we expect, but standards?  While it sounds like an odd concept, the common thread is that they come thru Clapton's personality.  Much of the record is the kind of laid back JJ Cale influenced work he has favored post 1974. (River Runs Deep, Traveling Alone,).  There are a number of blues songs that sound like they would fit in a late night set with a small band in a small club, such as Rocking Chair, Milkman, Hard Times, and Rolling and Tumbling.  All are well performed and completely enjoyable.<br /><br />Interestingly, as I see it, the emotional core of the record is made up of standards-songs like Autumn Leaves, How Deep Is the Ocean, Crazy About You Baby and When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful.  Clapton has known and sung these songs since childhood, and they are as much a part of him as breathing.  These songs have a different structure, yet their feel is consistent with the record.  Clapton's voice is perfect for these songs and his playing as usual is stellar.<br /><br />In my not so humble opinion, this is Clapton's best cd of new material since From the Cradle.  I highly recommend it.  Enjoy
B0036EH3X4|4.0|I started watching Lost a year ago, plowed through until the end of Season 5, and watched Season 6 as it aired on ABC.  While at times I was disappointed with Season 6, overall I'm thrilled with the conclusion and the quality of writing six years into the series.  Rarely will you find a show that lasts this long and still keeps you glued to the screen.    As with all seasons of Lost, Season 6 feels different.  Season 1 was about building characters and discovery on the island.  Season 2 develops characters further while exploring the hatch and the Dharma Initiative.  Season 3 we learn about the Others and follow several stories as the Losties take separate paths.  Season 4 tells the story of the Oceanic Six - how they escaped the island and their lives afterward.  Season 5 deals with their return to the island, the origins of the The Incident, and, of course, time travel.  And now Season 6... what was Season 6 about?    According to roughly 50% of all Lost viewers (maybe more?), Season 6 was about screwing everything up.  It was about either not answering questions or giving crappy ones.  It was about failing to deliver on promises the writers made to their fans.  While I respect these opinions, I disagree.    Even though it wasn't spelled out until its very last moments, Season 6 was about saying goodbye - and love.  In the flash-sideways the writers revisit each character and grant them something they either did not have or failed to grasp during their lives - choice.  Kate will always run.  Jack will always have daddy-issues.  Ben will always hold the power to manipulate.  But in Season 6, Kate chooses the unselfish route by helping Claire.  Jack chooses to have an open, loving relationship with his son.  Ben chooses love over power. Season 6 shows what Jacob robbed them of - the power to choose.  (Sorry buddy, but you failed big time in giving your \\"candidates\\" choices.)  Reflecting on the difficult lives of the Losties over six seasons, the flash-sideways endsup being utterly tragic, yet heartwarming all at once.  Despite having difficult lives, the Losties had each other, and the flash sideways shows they really were good people.  Live together, die alone?  I don't think so.    Season 6 was also about tying up loose ends.  Exploring major mythology elements such as the Smoke Monster, Jacob, and Richard Alpert's history.  Not all of these answers proved to be satisfying (*cough* Charles Widmore *cough*), but Lost was never strong with concrete answers.  From Day 1, Lost was strongest with mysteries and characters.  Even so, Lost DID deliver answers - not answers to every nagging question, but to the big ones.  It also tied up the island nicely and gave us an emotional goodbye to our favorite characters.  Why the hate, everyone?    4/5 stars for a strong finish with some stumbles along the way.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|A most entertaining and enjoyable series. Based on Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth novels, it tells the story of Richard Cypher, a former woods guide and his companions,fighting on the side of good and right.  Series 2 is beautifully filmed in New Zealand, and the combination of stunning scenery, excellent acting from the cast and extremely high production values make this a box set well worth the money.

0143116177|4.0|This book gives a good to the point overview of how we got from metal coins to printed money.  Could have shortened the examples and stories used as references.  I was hoping for more information on how current particular banking products actually function as opposed to how they increased the money supply.  Such as; if I was to invest in a particular product how do I get started, what should I expect, and what are the pitfalls.  The last chapter did an excellant summation of why people and therefore markets are so volatile.  I would have enjoyed a prediction of what the next great thing is going to be.  You have to like to read about economic history to complete this book.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|This series has proven to be much more than another teenage vampire drama. The acting is excellent, and the characters are well developed. Not to mention the eye-candy the actors provide! All in all, I would say this is an excellent series, much above the standard teen vampire craze.

B003UYUQZW|4.0|I dont know what to tell ya,  I really like this movie.  It seems that a lot of people  have criticized this movie for having  poor story writing I just dont agree. The writers took an action movie story line but made it much better than the stereotype, action, intrigue, story twists, and a wonderful script and characters. It was really nice to not have to roll my eyes at a silly jokes or drama or attempt of a romantic moment that was not believable. I am  sick of the typical one night stance romance and while the love in Prince of Persia is not necessarily done perfectly, it is done really well. I cannot say more without adding spoilers, but I think that the story (unlike many, many movies coming out) is NOT predictable and it kept me holding my breath. In my opinion, this movie is extremely under rated and I wish that others would give the producers, directors, and actors the pat on the back they so richly deserve. Whoo hoo, I really enjoyed this movie. It is so very unique and the story is intriguing. The script is original and the humor kept the theater chuckling. The fight scenes in this movie are now by far some of my favorites and there are plenty of times when you feel your heart pumping. I thought the acting by Gemma Arterton was absolutely brilliant and while I tend to not like Jake Gylenhaal, I have to admit he did a stelar job as Prince Dastan and REALLY added a very real and personable action hero. The scenery was beautiful, the attention to detail refreshing, and the specially effects blended wonderfully. I will most definitely buy this movie when it comes out in Blu-ray.

0525951652|3.0|Fall of Giants is an epic work of historical fiction by Ken Follett. It is the first installment of a planned three part trilogy. This book is set in Europe from 1911-1925. Follett follows the lives of five families in England, Germany, Russia, and the US. The story primarily focuses on three topics - the rise of socialism/bolshevism, the First World War, and women's suffrage - that are chronicled through the actions of these families. I am not even going to attempt to summarize the plot but suffice to say that the major historical events in this time period are included.<br /><br />Historical figures (George V, Wilson, WWI generals, Wilhelm II) interact with the fictional characters in realistic ways. This is a time period with which I have some familiarity and I was impressed with the depth and accuracy of the historical research included in this story. Follett provides a full review of the Russian Revolution providing detail that I think many readers will find new. His depiction of the Russian nobility particularly as it contrasts with the English nobility points out why the revolution in Russia was more extreme that the rise of socialism in Britain. The story resonated with me when Follett spent some time in developing the background. I thought the section on the Welsh coal miners was excellent, giving the reader a realistic view of the terror that was coal mining in the early 1900s. Also the parts on trench warfare in France told through several of the characters experience were very well done and will remain with the reader.<br /><br />It really is a great retelling of early 20th century events, very readable and epic in scale. So why did I not love it. This is usually just my kind of book. I think my problem was in the character development or lack thereof. With few exceptions - Billy Williams, the Welsh coal miner, his sister Ethel and Lady Maud Fitzherbert - I just didn't really care about what happened to them. Most of the characters were flat and clich&eacute;d. All of the characters acted in predictable ways and even though they experienced tumultuous events no character growth is seen. Compared to Follett's work on medieval England (Pillars of the Earth and World Without End) this beginning left me a little disappointed. So in summary I'd rate this 3.5 if I could, great story not so great characters.<br /><br />Side note I read an advance reader copy that was huge - 4.5 inches thick, I am rethinking a kindle purchase!haracters acted in predictable ways and even though they experienced tumultuous events no character growth is seen.

0061689246|3.0|On rare occasion the makers of movies surprise the heck out of me and produce a better movie than the book it is based on. Stardust is one such occasion in my opinion...and it is just that; an opinion.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman created the characters but the movie brought them to life in a way that Mr. Gaiman couldn't and usually it's the other way around.<br /><br />The main problem I had with the story was the vast cast of characters who were introduced and never fully developed. I think that when I am distracted enough to have these kinds of thoughts while in the middle of reading, the author has not done his job in suspending my disbelief and losing me in his universe.  My other criticism is that the ending was disappointing and anticlimactic. I don't know...perhaps Stardust needed to be a few hundred pages longer.<br /><br />All that said, Neil Gaiman has a creative genius that is unparalleled in the fantasy world. I just think he should have sat on Stardust for a few years to let it ripen.
0688163173|3.0|Shutter Island is a well-crafted book. It is gripping, well written, it flows nicely, and the plot is sound. But the book falls short because of some of some unnecessary content, and a poor ending.<br /><br />The year is 1954 and U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels goes to Shutter Island, a mysterious hospital for the criminally insane, to investigate the disappearance of one of the patients, Rachel Solando. He and his partner only just arrive when they realize that Ashecliffe is not what they appear to be. And neither is Teddy.<br /><br />Was he sent to Ashecliffe to investigate a missing patient, or to find out if they really approach psychiatry in ways including drug experimentation, terrible surgical trials, and deadly countermoves against Soviet brainwashing?<br /><br />In the end, though, we find the answer to all of our questions to be worlds away from what we originally thought, bringing the book to a dark, brooding, and unhappy close.<br /><br />Over all, Shutter Island brings us into a fast-paced, gripping 1950's psychological thriller involving interesting characters and a foreboding setting, a hospital for the criminally insane. All of this looks very promising if you're looking for a good chilling mystery. And for most of the book, Dennis Lehane kept good on his promise for a great thriller. His tone was dark, and his writing style fitted the mood perfectly, dipping us into Teddy Daniels's mind and telling us his thoughts.<br /><br />Slowly, Lehane revealed the intricate folds of the story through flashbacks, dreams, and odd scenes that I couldn't quite tell if it was actual events, or Teddy's dreams. But it all fit together in the end when I finally understood it all.<br /><br />The characters were definitely well done. Teddy was the perfect trying-to-be-brave macho U.S. Marshal who obviously had some problems but did well to hide them. His partner was the light-hearted comic relief that such a dark book needs, and the supporting cast, a scattering of mysterious orderlies, doctors, and nurses, along with some intimidating villainous overseers, a deputy warden, and the warden himself--obviously the mad scientist Teddy knew they were.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the way Lehane played out the story out and made the characters interact, and the atmosphere he created with Ashecliffe hospital looming in the background with all of the secrets it held.<br /><br />For the book he was writing, Dennis Lehane certainly achieved his purpose. A frightening thriller with a huge twist I might have glimpsed in the distance, but never would have guessed. It's obvious Lehane likes to play with characters by the way he tantalizes Teddy, and makes him interact with other characters, like the deputy warden, the villain of the book. Lehane doesn't fall too heavily into the common writer faults, like excessive use of passive voice, adjective and adverbs, and dragging dialogue. In truth, I thought his dialogue was accurate for each of the characters, and well played out. I wasn't bored by long conversations.<br /><br />I saw no glaring faults and few errors that could easily be avoided. Over all, his writing is simple, fast-paced, and gripping. Having not read any of his other works, I can't compare this to what else he's written.<br /><br />Overall, I found this book to be extremely interesting and a wonderful read, and would highly recommend it to most anyone who likes a gritty psychological thriller that will keep you reading late into the night with a flashlight and all the lights on, except for two things.<br /><br />There were a couple of graphic sexual scenes that easily could have been avoided. They had no necessity to neither plot nor character development.<br /><br />The second reason is the use of excessive strong language. This too took away from the book, though not quite as much as the inappropriate content. A slight scattered usage of language would be expected for the genre, but the frequent pervasive language took away from the book's purpose.<br /><br />I still have to touch briefly on one more aspect. I didn't enjoy how the book ended. I can understand it completely, but I wouldn't have ended the book in that way. Teddy was a character that Lehane developed extremely well, and the ending caused me to certainly feel sorry for him, but detached me from him someone. I felt somewhat cheated that I had put all of my emotions on the line for this guy for him to turn out as he did.<br /><br />The book was thoroughly enjoyable, apart from the unnecessary content. The ending, though not completely satisfying, was endurable and fitting for the book it was. Even so, I'm sure there are other books out there that can pull off a similar story in a better fashion.enjoy how the book ended.

B0044430H8|4.0|Containing robotic synth themes and some cues that are more like \\"sound collages,\\" this film score has an edgy, industrial kind of feel.  I'm sure nine inch nail fans will be drawn to this, and will enjoy it, but I think fans of electronic and film music will find it interesting too.  I respectively disagree with a comment by customer reviewer Felker, that this is Trent Reznor \\"at his best.\\"  I think that description should be reserved for the greatest NIN music such as Downward Spiral.  This movie music is good, but it's no masterpiece or anything.  This album is merely a moderately entertaining set of instrumental synth/keyboard pieces.  Atticus Ross, Mr. Reznor's partner for this work, should also be acknowledged.  While he did work with Trent on some NIN recordings, his more recent and relevant attachment to TR is on the project called \\"How To Destroy Angels.\\"

B003HC8I5M|2.0|A reference point for this album is Phil Collins' version of \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" in 1983.  Another would be Sheryl Crow's recent cover version of the Jackson 5 nugget \\"I Want You Back\\" on her latest album.  Now Mr. Collins has released a whole album of covers of '60s classics, and it feels like a pointless exercise.  These new versions can at best be described as \\"competent,\\" but the horns are often mixed too far back, and there are other problems.  Most notably, Phil's vocals often sound too thin for the material, as on \\"Blame It On The Sun.\\"  As for the horns, just listen to \\"Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me For a Little While).\\"  You can hardly hear the horns at all there!<br /><br />One more (preemptive) comment: I sure hope this CD does not receive any 5-star reviews.  If you give this five stars, you are saying it as good as Collins' best work such as Face Value.  I would certainly give that (FV) five stars, but saying this new album is just as good?  That's insane.  Another way to look at it is to consider the original soul classics.  Assuming you would give those five stars, would you also give Collins' versions the same rating?  For example, are you saying Collins' new version of \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\" is as good as Stevie Wonder's 1966 original?  If not, then the new version should not get 5 stars.

B002VPE1PW|4.0|I travel pretty often for work so I was really thrilled to be able to try out this product.<br /><br />Some pros of the case: I really like that it lays flat and that it's very malleable.  This makes for easy use while trying to work on airline's small tray tables.  I also like that it offers a \\"germ\\" barrier between the tray and my PC.  The zippers open easily, awesome when you're trying to do that awkward, fast, dance through security.  Another plus with the security line, the slick insides make for easy removal from even a overly packed bag.  I also like the brightly colored inside. I also appreciate the slimness of the sleeve, leaving me plenty of room in my carry on for other items.<br /><br />Cons: a common thread with other reviews, but I'd have to agree, this case does not fit my HP mini notebook.  The elastic corners, which I'm assuming are designed to hold the notebook are therefore pretty useless.  Thus, my notebook sits very loose in the sleeve.  One of my \\"pros\\" unfortunately has a con side as well.  Since there is no way to secure my notebook, and the inside of the sleeve is slick neoprene, it is VERY easy to let your notebook slip out and crash to the floor.  I had several near misses at first when I was quickly trying to repack everything after getting through the security line.  Also, since the case is so malleable, there's no easy way to just slip your notebook back into the sleeve, while it's in a briefcase. If you try, it just results it your bunching and jamming the sleeve further into your bag.  You really have to take the sleeve out, and insert your notebook that way.<br /><br />Overall, I don't think the Cons would outweigh the Pros for me.  I like the product and will continue to use it.

B001OQCV2E|2.0|Limburger!  Special effects and dialog are much worse than it's predecessor, 'Day After Tomorrow'.
030745455X|5.0|This book is enjoyable; one of those \\"can't wait to read\\" kind of books. I am glad that my friend told me that it was not like the first novel, which described some disturbing situations. (I found the other novel to be similar to \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\")
0345505387|5.0|This is another great addition to the Outlander Series. Any Outlander fan will not only enjoy the new material to an already amazing story but have the pleasure of seeing it visually. The art work was amazing and thats no small task re-creating a book millions love.
030726999X|4.0|I enjoyed reading this last novel by Steig Larsson. It was long winded; it seemed like half historical novel, half fiction. I am grateful that the story line did not follow obvious paths, it kept me wanting to read on! Also, the author refrained from turning his heroine into super-woman, so for that I thank him.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|this is the best gift I ever got. I love Glee!!! Got this item a week sooner than expected.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|This is one of those quiet and and very deep records that can make you weep. Peter Gabriel is at his most vulnerable and these re-workings of incredible source material often far surpass the originals.  The cover art of two blood cells embracing each other makes complete sense. John Metcalfe (the arranger) and Peter Gabriel poured their blood into this music. Heavenly.  Since I received this CD I have actually sat down and listened to it many times- not in the background or while doing anything else like driving or checking my email. I just sit down and listen to this music. Over and over again.

B000MV8ZD6|1.0|I will keep this short.<br /><br />Fulci is known is being this great director of horror movies, but none of his movies are any good.  I have no idea why people think they are, but they just aren't.  He's one of the worst directors I've ever seen try to pace a movie or logically roll through a plot.  In Fulci movies, things happen for no reason, and characters die for no reason.  Everyone in all of his films are so incredibly disposable you don't even care when they die.  This entire movie is totally unwatchable until the final scene in the cellar, which is why the movie is famous at all.  You are introduced to a very cool looking antagonist, but his purpose is entirely unclear.<br /><br />Overall, I have no idea why anything happened in this movie.  I don't know why the characters don't fight the antagonist, I dont know why the antagonist is an antagonist, and I'm totally lost by the very last scene where the boy is rescued.  This whole damn movie made no sense. Don't watch it, it isnt even worth it for the gore, and its not scary.
0739384171|4.0|By the time I finished listening to the first 4 or 5 chapters, I was ready to slit my wrists. This book made me realize the importance of editors. For sure, if I was reading this book I never would have finished it. However, by the middle of the novel I was hooked! Lizabeth Salander is quite a unique and weird individual. I could not help wanting to know more about her when the book ended. After an extremely slow start the story really takes off and I could not wait to see what happened. It was amusing, suspenseful and fun. Not recommended for anyone under 16yrs. old. I liked it so much that I purchased the other two books in the trilogy. If you can be patient it will be worth it.
1601252463|5.0|As an unrepentant nerd, I don't have an issue saying that I've got a few pen & paper games under my belt. I've played everything Wizards of the Coast came out with since 2000, have a fair bit of experience of AD&D, and some other, less prominent games as well. Chances are, if you're looking at this book, you've already played Paizo Publishing's Pathfinder Roleplaying Game, a game which many consider to be the spiritual successor to the Dungeons & Dragons saga. This book, in addition to presenting six new base classes to entice you with, also has taken the core classes (Barbarian through Wizard) and given each, on average about ten, ways to customize those base classes to whatever it is you've been dreaming of seeing your character doing. Do you like the ranger, but also like Animorphs? Now, you can take the ranger and turn him into an animal shape-shifter! Are you a fan of the paladin, but never find yourself using his small spell list? Trade spell-casting in for an aura of light that provides aid to you and your allies using the Warrior of the Holy Light archetype! Other options include the Drunken Master Monk, the court bard, the rake rogue, a slew of sub domains for clerics, new bloodlines for sorcerers, and sub-schools for wizards. There's something for every class.<br /><br />Next, this book almost doubles the list of available feats. Remember that scene in Lord of the Rings where Legolas is firing arrows at the orc horde and suddenly takes an arrow and stabs an enemy that gets too close, before loading that same arrow and firing again? There's a feat for that. Do you like casting acid arrow at that demon over yonder, but hate his unnaturally lucky spell resistance rolls? Take another stab at evil when your spell bounces off and hits the next nearby enemy! Do you like playing the halfling, but are sick of being seen as just a half-pint? Do you love your half-orc, but hate the stares the commoners throw at her? Take the feat that lets you pass for human! Or embrace your heritage and give them something to stare at when you take a feat that gives your tusks enough of an edge to be considered weapons in their own right!<br /><br />New prestige classes abound in this book. From the Battle Herald, a bardic cavalier that leads her allies to victory through inspiration and mounted prowess, to the Rage Prophet, a touch of Old Testament prophets that mean business for their god. If you like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, you'll love the Master Chymist Prestige class, built especially as a nice item for the Alchemist class (presented earlier in the book).<br /><br />This book doesn't skimp on spells either. It's tough to go through and list the variety of options presented, but just know that there are spells for every class. Equipment has been added in as well, from the practical to the insane, you'll find that it isn't left wanting.<br /><br />The book also takes the opportunity to add new rules to the game system, all optional. The developers said that this is a supplement. It's a compendium of advanced rules that can add flavor to a game.<br /><br />All in all, it's a very complete book that provides variant options that almost everyone can enjoy and benefit from. It's one of the most complete supplemental books released for a Pen & Paper RPG to date and it's also earns every dime you spend on it. Unlike some previous addition \\"splat books\\" you won't feel like your money could have better been spent elsewhere. The Paizo team worked hard on this, taking in feedback from its user base (they beta released all the classes for anyone on the Paizo messageboard community to test and weigh in on) and built a masterpiece.
B0021L8UQ2|2.0|I can't believe how tremendously funny this movie is!  I went along with it for the first half hour or so, and then I realized the plot deals with a bunch of idiots, an a-hole husband bordering on gaydom, a brat son who seems to be around just to antagonize people, a wife who just can't seem to get it, a truly idiotic shrink who, in real life, would be thrown out of the practice -- so I really enjoyed everything from then on.  I kept rooting for \\"the orphan\\", waiting for her to do away with the son first, then some of those rotten school kids.  The husband got more and more gay with each scene, and went overboard in the climactic scenes.  Speaking of climactic scenes -- whoa there, who thunk up that one?  All in all, it's a terrific film if you want some real guffaws.  Poor CCH Pounder, not only does she get messed up in the plot, but the fact that she even did the picture is sad. But, at least, the little deaf girl does some good work.  The extra star is for her!
B003TML0VO|4.0|I'm not one for writing a review for music projects, but after reading the closed minded rantings of those who panned this recording, I decided to enter my opinion.  The greatest guitar songs or the greater guitarist is always a debateable topic. I like this record. Sure it was designed as a commercial effort, but in the music business, you want to express your talent, but it is also nice to be able to sell a few copies as well. I have many favorite guitar players and Santana has not always been on the list, but that is a choice of personal likes and dislikes. However, after listening to the record, I finally see that Carlos is much more versatile than a lot of us realized. I pretty sure Bill Graham had a pretty good ear for talent. If you are too much of a purist, don't buy this record. But if you want to hear a different take on several classic songs, give it a listen. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is probably my favorite, but I have always been a fan of George Harrison and I figure Carlos Santana has respect and admiration for the man as well.  Nuff said?
0345505387|2.0|Very Disappointing.  Seemed like a weak reason to write a \\"graphic novel\\".  Quality of the writing was way below what I expected from Gabaldon.  Book did not do justice to Outlander...from anyone's perspective. You had to know Outlander to make sense of The Exile. Initially kind of fun to see the drawings, but then it grew tiresome when little text was printed and mostly a rehash of Outlander.  Too bad...it would have been a fascinating, clever book to read Outlander from another character's perspective. Gabaldon has an unusually devoted fan base that would be anxious to read something new.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I used my last pair of these for about 8 years. They'd still be working if I didn't jam the cable in my car. These work great. No spongy parts. Great for running.
0887431453|5.0|This is one of the first activity books I've ordered for my 3 year old. She loves to work on the pages and the content is great. It covers shapes, colors, letters, sounds, numbers, etc. My daughter finds it fun to pick some pages and work on them.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|This movie was excellent.  And I got it for a decent price.  That makes the whole transaction worth while.
0307454541|3.0|I'll keep this short as Cowboy Bill already summed it up well. Books that address sexual violence - be they fiction or non-fiction, are nothing new and quite often literary legends (Clockwork Orange comes to mind) and I'm not a PG-13 reader. But the violence in this book was too much for me and not necessary for the plot to move forward.  Of course I'm wrong - this series is much about that kind of violence.  Seeing that the next one is about a 13 year old girl strapped to a bed, and this isn't my thing, I will be staying away from the movie as well as the rest of the series.
1439102813|5.0|Fabulous debut novel by Lisa Genova.  The protagonist is a woman named Alice who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease at fifty years old.  The novel follows her journey into the abyss that is Alzheimer's Disease from Alice's perspective.  Heartbreaking, enlightening and altogether well written, this book is the most realistic depiction of Alzheimer's Disease I have seen, even if it is a work of fiction.  Someone I love has advanced AD.  I wish I had read this book at the onset of her illness as it would have given me a much better idea of how she was feeling and suffering.
0811870413|5.0|I live in San Francisco, an avid home baker, and Tartine and I go way back.  When they first opened their shop on 18th and Guerrero, I lived a half-block away, and would sneak over for a croissant, morning bun, or some bread pudding early in the morning.  Since those days, Tartine (along with the other shops on 18th St.) has become a big attraction for food tourists visiting the Mission, but continues to have a strong and devoted local following.  These guys believe in what they are doing, and the quality of their breads and pastries far surpasses anyone in SF.  You haven't really experienced bread until you've popped in at 5pm to grab a steaming country loaf and squatted on a stoop outside to tear into it.  I can never get more than 10 yards away from the shop before pinching off a bit to taste.  When my wife bought me a copy of this book, I was ecstatic.  Here is a story of a man who is dedicated to bread, telling you how he arrived at his perfect loaf, and then how you might make your own perfect loaf.  Rather than providing exhaustive formulas, you are required to smell, touch, look at your dough, and adjust for variations.  Living in SF, where the weather will change in an instant, you have to be able to improvise as a baker, and this book shows you how to do that.  If you don't have time in your life to become a devoted bread lover, cultivating a natural yeast culture, this book might not be for you, but maybe it would change your mind.  The bread really is that good.
B000024D4R|1.0|Well, it's like this. I'm mainly an admirer of Pink Floyd's old-school work if anything. Their first hit single (and known released song far as I know) \\"Arnold Layne\\" still is my favorite if I had to pick just one. That having been said, \\"See Emily Play\\" was great too. My absolute favorite is debatable between Dark Side of the Moon - the 2nd best selling album ever behind Michael Jackson's Thriller ...or the very touchy thought provoking \\"Wish you were here\\", particularly it's centerpiece track - especially parts 5/6/7/8/9. Animals was good, 1 or 2 songs better than others but as was definitely the case with 1983's \\"Final Cut\\" this just sounds more like a Roger Waters solo album versus Pink Floyd as they're defined by.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I agree with the reviewer who left The American 30 minutes to go watch their lawn grow. That is what I should have done. Watching the grass grow would have been more exciting. The scenery was great, but it also upset me because I could have gotten a two-hour nap in the theater if not for the overly vivid scenery shining into my eyes. I wanted to give this zero stars or a half-star, but I wasn't able to. So, please know that I am being overly, overly generous with my one star review. The shame of it is that it will probably be up for some Academy Awards because it was \\"artsy\\" \\"intriguing\\" or a study in \\"character development.\\" Tough to see how the characters develop with so little dialogue and having to read the dailogue since Clooney was the only one who spoke any English. If not for the bright, vivid scenery, there are times when you feel you're watching a silent film from the 1920's. Boooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrring. I wish I could get those 2 hours of my life and my $10 back. Please don't buy this movie. Save your money for something good and thank me later when you do something else in those two hours that you would have spent watching this boring piece of garbage.
B00156VGX8|3.0|Some critics say that Monica Bellucci was brave to take this part. I don't know if that's true but I think that people who get through *that* scene were brave to have watched it. I turned away. It was awful and never seemed to end. The intent, I've heard, in editing the film in reverse was to show that revenge isn't admirable, no matter what. I won't spoil the ending [beginning] but I wouldn't recommend this for the average viewer. A big problem that people may have with the film is that it could attract sadists but that doesn't make it any less of a powerful film. A film that makes you feel actual human emotions for the characters involved. It's horrible to experience and makes you feel like a voyeur in a way that no other film has made me feel. You don't cheer for the \\"good guys\\" and you just walk away feeling really poorly about the human race, I did. But, it is a film that makes you think and feel and it definitely qualifies as art not entertainment.
B003ZGMFGI|5.0|There are many labels that the band could be pegged with. Synthpop. Electronic. Post Punk. Experimental. Some Trashy Pop Group. That last one was just a tease from the frontman himself. You might only remember the band for their hit single 'If You Leave' - this is at which singer Andy McCluskey joked the above during a live show in 1986: that it took them from the good, old days of dives and Seriously Cool Music to an overnight limelight factory. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were all those things, and more.    But why talk in the past? Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark ARE all these things and more. They've steadily built up from a tentative reformation for a series of one off concerts in the mid 00's to an active tour around Europe to promote the 30th anniversary of Architecture and Morality. There have even been a few forays back into Seriously Cool Music with the collaboration of Andy McCluskey, Hambi Haralambous and Peter Saville in The Energy Suite art installation and a glorious show with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra that transformed many of their hits into sublime symphonic seductions.    Have I brought you up to speed there? Good. The fine fellows of OMD decided it was time to delve into their creative subconscious once more, to get out a few of those persistently nagging thoughts that musicians often call inspiration. It was the right time. A fresh start after 14 years of radio silence. Not a comeback for the money but a return to the joy of performing music they believed in. This box set is the culmination of that belief and their hard work emanates from every last note. This box set, this album, this cache of songs will entrance the new listener and bring common ground to even the most ardent Seriously Cool Music old fan.    Don't come into the listening experience with some idea of how you think they will sound. Pretend it's the first time you've ever heard music in your life. From the opening blasts on New Babies; New Toys to the final echoing refrains on The Right Side?, let your mind walk unfettered through the concept of the music.    Imagine yourself turning off your television \\"They don't want you, they don't need you, they just use you, they just bleed you.\\".  Let your cares be lifted \\"Nothing stops us, not today\\".  Posit existence ending \\"Everything you take, everything you gave, all the things you found, all the things you made... nothing will remain, cradle or the grave\\".  Correct your view of the present: \\"The last mistake you ever make is thinking modern's new forever\\".  Wrap yourself in the disquieting truths: \\"And it doesn't matter if I say I Love You, no matter how good today is, at the end we just sleep in a bed\\".  Reach out to that which inspires you: \\"The only constant through it all is what you had begun\\".  Introspection in the city streets: \\"There's no way of knowing if this pain will ever fade, there is no denying that this is what we made\\".  Dance through the shoes and handbags littering the club: \\"Like a bullet from a gun it will run, like an arrow from a bow to you, like a speeding train on wheels of steel...\\".  Consider challenging the religious status quo: \\"I don't know exactly what I'd do, if everything she told us would come true\\".  Know what you like: \\"You say that I'm a user, words just confuse ya, it's abuse but that's what you came for\\".  Accept the way things are: \\"And once again the dread, is burning in your head, you try but can't let go, this pain that kills you so \\".  Embrace commitments: \\"it's a beautiful burden, the Bondage of Fate\\"  Latch onto a lover: \\"So which one will you be? The boy who's always broken, the girl in misery?\\"    The tunes are craftily textured, the lyrics harbor cleverness for sincerity's sake,and the earnest nature of the packaging elevates this project from mere cheers of Still Have It In Them to I Never Knew This Side Of Them. Who needs innovation when revolution is so much more satisfying? Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's History of Modern should be yours today.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|**spoiler alert** First, you have to GET Joss Whedon's writing style to enjoy this. If you don't get it, then you won't like it. It's very Whedon-y. Second, my review is going to be extremely slanted because I do GET and thoroughly enjoy Whedon's universe. So, assuming that you've never seen an episode of Firefly, but that you are acquainted with the Buffy Universe you'll understand that sarcasm, unexpected humor in dark situations, girl power, and smarm are all part of the charm that is Serenity. It's more blatantly a \\"space western\\" than even Star Wars was. It is literally young man go terraform a planet instead of young man go west. The government is a bad thing, the government wants to control how you think, feel, and behave. Some people, like Captain Mal Reynolds and his crew don't hold to that. Psychic River Tam was experimented on by the government and was rescued by her brother Simon but not before she learned a horrible secret from certain members of Parliament that they don't want the general populous to know. Now, The Operative is chasing River and the whole crew of Serenity and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Mal is a good man with his own unique code. He's a thief along the Robin Hood vein, if Robin Hood kept the loot for himself rather than giving it to the poor. But he's knows right from wrong and he believes in something greater than himself even if it takes the entire movie for him to understand that quality in himself. In short, the bad guys get it, the good guys don't come out unscathed and it's a completely satisfying end to a series that I wish had never been cancelled. But, if wishes were horses I'd be a space captain.
B002G1X350|4.0|My favorite Leave's Eyes album so far is Lovelorn, and whilst I really like this album, and I'd buy it again, it's my least favorite of their three studio albums thus far.  To my ears the sound has started to become somewhat formulaic in this album, and the endless use of various grunts and growls is a good illustration of what I mean.  On Lovelorn those same grunts and growls really fitted in with the music and added to it; there are just too many songs on this album that sound like they came from an over zealous following of some rule-book that said 'insert grunt here', whether it would add to the music or not.    The best tracks on this album (which is the majority) have the same gorgeous melodies as we've come to know and love from this band, so it's still definitely worth buying.  I just find that there are things that sounded fresh on their first album that are getting to sound a little repetetive on this one.    I have to admit I had extra high expectations of this album because these guys are definitely amongst my favorites; perhaps my expectations were just a little too high.  I just hope that on future albums they don't feel trapped into the expectations of their own genre, but instead give themselves complete freedom to do what sounds 'right' to them, because I think that will sound right to their fans too (or at least this one).    Oh, and in case you're wondering, I'm not gruntaphobic, just listen to the title track of Thy Kingdom Gone by Flowing Tears to hear just how breathtaking a song can be when grunts are used effectively, or even (Deep) Frozen by Delain (bonus track on their first album).    If I could I'd give this 3.5 out of 4.  Definitely not bad, just not the most played on my iPod.
B002RWKSII|1.0|I was really disappointed in Brian Wilson's attempts to handle Gershwin.  His voice just does not have the depth or range to handle complex arrangements.  Go back to the Beach Boy genre, and stick with it.
0316017922|5.0|Book was exactly as described, and it is what was required for my class. Really good book!
B003EYVXYG|4.0|I enjoyed this film when I watched the pre-theatrical release here on Amazon, and picked up this two-disc special edition as soon as it came out. Initially, I was disappointed that there are no deleted scenes, as I felt like there might have been something missing in the last third of the film. It seems that, in fact, nothing was cut. The lack of deleted scenes is more than made up for with the full-length documentary \\"Walking After Midnight,\\"  which follows the tightly scheduled filming, done under sometimes brutal weather conditions. Together with the 13 behind-the-scene shorts, \\"Sarge\\" short film and storyboards, Disc 2 is worth having if you're at all into the movie.<br /><br />The film itself deals with the \\"Hatfields vs. McCoys\\" mentality, illustrated pretty literally with feuding families whose ideological differences make them incapable of working together in any way, even under the most dire of circumstances. It's an apt allegory for our times -- maybe more of a mirror on early 21st Century politics than they even realized as it was being made.
1592289444|4.0|This is a classic book and one to be read more than once if there was ever such a book.  Just a few months ago we wanted to read it again and couldn't find our copy. I ordered another one and have it stashed away for when the time is right. Last time, my friend borrowed the book to read  it but I never got it back. It is as good a read as the first time around. I give it four stars for its adventure, and the vivid descriptions. We first became acquainted with this memoir about 8 years ago. My friend sat on the edge of the tv one evening and heard an advertisement about the book. He was so captivated that he read the entire book within a few days. We were so impressed with this book that we told all of our friends and loaned our secound copy out again.
B003N2DIYM|4.0|I think the book is great in sharing information in a well organized manner.  I enjoyed reading the book but was disappointed to find that the code for the website no longer works.  To take the website test to find your strengths, than another more recent book must be bought.
0345505387|5.0|This is the first graphic novel I have ever bought. I absolutely loved it!  The artwork was so beautiful that I found myself almost forgetting to read the words.  It was lovely to see characters I have loved for so many years depicted in a new format.  Diana Gabaldon expanded the original Outlander story by telling it from different points of view, revealing a new character and including additional details fans of the series will enjoy.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|First is a general overview, then you can skip down to the track-by-track detailed review!    Zac Brown Band -You Get What You Give  (Sept 21,2010)  The band's fourth studio album, (but 2nd in the spotlight) and follow-up to the hugely successful double-platinum \\"The Foundation\\" from late 2008, is nothing less than a continuation of the toe-tapping grass roots musicianship, stellar vocal harmonies and honest songwriting that keeps Zac Brown Band on the top of the charts and a regular nominee of nearly every award available in the (country) music industry lately.    This album, while still a fresh release at the time of this review, contains several would-be/should-be radio hits, including the current hit, a collaboration with now-veteran country music giant Alan Jackson, \\"As She's Walking Away\\".  If you're a fan of their previous album The Foundation, or at least the 4 #1s that album introduced to the radio: \\"Chicken Fried\\", \\"Toes\\", \\"Highway 20 Ride\\", and \\"Free\\", and the #2 \\"Whatever it is\\", you will no doubt find this album to be another just like it. Like those hits, this album is woven with upbeat hardcore down home country elements, country pop-rock toe-tappers, and soft emotion. I almost consider this album to be `The Foundation- Part II'...but that's just my opinion.  And I mean that in a good way, believe me.      Following is a song-by-song synopsis of what you can expect from this album.  These are my personal opinions and comparisons.    Track List    1.  Let it Go  What a track to kick off the new album!  Put the windows down and crank it up!  This track is about enjoying life and has an inspirational message urging you to forget the crap that you can't do anything about while enjoying what you have before it's too late.  If only everybody lived by the lyrics of this song...  Lots of energy and drive, sure to be a radio hit.     2. Knee Deep (feat. Jimmy Buffet)  A beachy, getaway song.  Upbeat and catchy, this song had me humming the chorus melody throughout the next day, even though I couldn't remember the words just yet!  This song has the same lyrical style as \\"Toes\\", and (I'll probably say this a lot throughout my review) would be a great candidate for radio.  It's about wanting to get away from it all, and then finally being able to get away from it all.    3.  No Hurry  Let's slow it down a bit.  This song carries a relaxing feel, and the lyrics blend well with that feel.  It's about not rushing around with everyday things- what's the hurry?  Life is life, and it will always be life until we're laid down...so just take a day to chill and enjoy something worth enjoying.  This song ties in well with the lyrics of Let it Go.  Definitely radio-worthy.    4.  I Play the Road  This is a different song.  I must honestly admit this is one of my least favorite on the album- just because of the musical style.  It's upbeat, more flowing than \\"punchy\\", yet different type of country song.  It reminds me a little of the (instrumental) song \\"Jessica\\" by the Allman Brothers...the tone of the instruments I guess.  The lyrics, however, are great.  They're written from the perspective of a performer who must live on the road, and only `visit' his family.  You see the world through his (or her) eyes, and the memories made on their many adventures.  This is perhaps a like-it-or-hate-it song.  I don't hate it, but I usually will skip it in favor of something more musically-pleasing....to me.    5.  Cold Hearted  This is my personal favorite on this album.   It is an easy-going, \\"flowing\\" song, somewhere between country and soft rock, with a wonderful melody.  Zac's vocals work wonderfully on this melancholy, love-gone-bad, mid-tempo ballad.  The chorus is brutally honest yet very catchy.  I'm not sure it's a chorus you'd want to be singing to anyone, but it's catchy for sure.  It could easily have been re-worded a little and made into a wonderful love ballad, perhaps instead titled \\"Whole Hearted\\"- but that's why I say Zac Brown Band is honest- they didn't want it to be a love ballad.  It may be too frank to be a radio hit, but I really like this song.      6.  Whiskey's Gone  Now here's a fairly funny song...yet perhaps a little racy.  It's definitely a honky-tonk hardcore country song, reminiscent (musically only) of a Ricky Skaggs kind of song...although there's no banjo- that I can remember anyway.  It's a light-hearted view of a drunk man's endeavors to either get her back or forget her entirely.  The lyrics are definitely PG-13.  This is the fastest song on the album.    7.  Quiet Your Mind   Unique to anything from ZBB thus far.  It still sounds like them (it's not that different), but I can't say it's not really country per se.  Another inspiring song about taking the time to appreciate what's around you, and telling your own thoughts and worries to hush it.  It kind of has a sunrise-esque feel to it, with a powerful chorus, and some really great vocal harmonies from the band.  Another favorite of mine.  Probably not something we'll ever hear on the radio since it's a break from mainstream, but that's not to say it isn't quality- it is.  It's a very good song musically, vocally, and lyrically.    8.  Colder Weather   Let's slow it way down now.  Other reviewers (on other sites) have given kudos to this song as their favorite.  It is good, intelligently-written and probably going to be their next slow radio release.  It's a somber ballad, heavy with piano, speaking of a \\"ramblin' man\\" who `doesn't want her but he needs her', and his love's heartbreak at this plight she finds herself in with her man running off, only to want to be with her again.  I'm not sure I fully understand the story here- I've thought about it but I guess you have to be that person to truly `get it'.  It's got a catchy chorus and plenty of emotion for ZBB.      9.  Settle Me Down  Another beachy, island type of song.  The melody of this song reminds me heavily of \\"Where the Boat Leaves From\\"  crossed with \\"Toes\\"from The Foundation, yet with more of a rat-a-tat-tat acoustic guitar feel.  It's about `cooling the fever is a man's blood'.  The song has in interesting musical \\"interlude\\" of sorts, something similar (yet not nearly as obscure) as that in \\"Sick 'em on a Chicken\\"...you can tell they had fun in the studio recording this one...as with \\"Sick `em\\".   I like this song, I think it's a good candidate for radio, yet not sure if it would overplay the whole beach/island feel.      10.  As She's Walking Away (feat. Alan Jackson)  Here's the one most everyone knows by now, their first radio release.  This song is nicely upbeat with very well-blended vocals and a catchy melody. This song is mainstream country. It took me a couple times hearing it to really get the message-  I've come to the conclusion it's about taking your chance with love before you end up missing out, and \\"falling in love as she's walking away\\" because you drug your feet, or because \\"your heart won't tell your mind to tell your mouth what it should say\\".  Alan Jackson apparently plays the role of the \\"wise man\\" (his father?) who shares the fact that he missed his chance, so he doesn't want it to happen to you....so \\"ask her to dance\\" before she walks away.  The overall message is one of positivity- even if you fall flat on your face, get back up- at least you tried.  \\"Don't let regret take hold\\".  I think we've all been there.    11.  Keep Me in Mind  This song is a very catchy toe-tapper and it is one that can easily get stuck in your head.  This song also has a bit of an island feel to it- but I don't think it's intentional.  The lyrics have nothing to do with getting away and all that, it's an optimistic (perhaps falsely) love song.  He's bummed that all the pretty girls are taken, and he's telling one in particular to \\"keep me in mind\\", should anything change.  The bridge is unique in this song, it takes a break from the musical momentum the song has built up and slows it down with some heavy orchestrastrings and ride cymbal.  I'm not sure if I'm alone in this, but it seems to remind me a bit of something James Taylor-ish at this point.  Then the song picks it's momentum back up and carries on.  It's a good arrangement, musically speaking.  Overall, I think this song would perform well playing on adult contemporary stations- it is not \\"country\\" in and of itself, except for the context of the rest of the album.      12.  Who Knows  Hmmm.  That's my one-word synopsis of this song.   It goes back and forth between a poppy-country and southern rock.  The \\"song\\" seems to end near the 4-minute mark, and then there's the musical free-for-all...this song is over 10 minutes long!  Some good musical solos for sure.  I can imagine this song is something great to see live.  I think they took a great live jam and decided to record it.  In my opinion it doesn't have the same effect.  Maybe it's just me....it probably is....    13.  Martin  It took me about 2 ½ times of listening to this song before I \\"got it\\".  WARNING- if you like to decode a bit of a mystery in a song, then don't read this!  I'm going to spoil it!  That being said....  \\"Martin\\" is Zac's guitar.  For those of you who don't know this- Martin is a very popular and expensive brand of acoustic guitar....hence the personification.  This song is slower, similar in style to \\"Highway 20 Ride\\".  It's, as we've just discussed, a tribute to his guitar.  The song is wonderfully poetic and well-written, and if you don't notice the guitar parallel (like I didn't the first couple times listening) it's still a nice song.  I guess I initially imagined and old friend who'd been through the wringer in his life.  I think that's the genius if this song, it doesn't make it too obvious what it's about (other than the title), it can be just poetry, but once you realize it's a \\"Ohhhhhhhh....I get it!\\"  moment.    14.  Make This Day  This song is a cross between boogy-woogy and good ol' southern rock.  It would definitely be a goodconcert song, with the chorus \\"Gonna make this day (MAKE THIS DAY!) a little better than the last (BETTER THAN THE LAST!)...\\"  I could see the crowd having fun with this one.  As a track on the album though, it's not one of my favorites.          The Wrap-Up  I completely understand if my synopses are far from your personal impressions, but hopefully this gives you an idea as to what you can expect from this album.  I highly recommend You Get What You Give to anyone who enjoyed The Foundation, or who likes what they've heard from Zac Brown Band on the radio that last year or two.  As with The Foundation, I'm sure there will be a couple gems on this album that won't make it to radio--so if you're not a buy-the-CD kind of person, you will be missing out.      My personal view of ZBB are is one of respect and admiration, and I'm not that easy to impress.  They are not only band members, but they are true musicians- top of their game.  I would love to see some musical collaboration with the likes of pickers Ricky Skaggs, Brad Paisley, and fiddler Charlie Daniels.   They have come on to the mainstream scene with a bang (4 #1s and a #2 from their first mainstream album)!  Who else has done this?  No seriously, I'm asking.  I'm sure it's been done, but it's rare.  Most artists are lucky to EVER get a #1 in their career, many are happy to get popular with a few top tens, max.  ZBB has the sound and talent to be one of the top groups of all time.  At this rate, they will undoubtedly be the next Alabama or the next Oak Ridge Boys (and I don't mean to offend any who think that comparison is sacrilege).      Happy listening!
B000ZELISO|1.0|This review is not about the movie or the disc quality.    This review is a warning regarding the digital copy code that was originally advertised with this disc, but no longer available to current buyers.  Unlike many of the other Blu-Ray discs I have purchased with digital copy codes, this disc came by far the shortest timeframe for using the code before it expires.  While many BD discs come with a 1-year, 2-year or indefinite time to use the code, this movie came with a code that only lasted 6 months.  Worst still, at the time of the writing of this review, the Half-Blood Prince movie is not available for digital download from iTunes, so this was the only opportunity I had to load it onto my iPod Touch.  When I tried to download this 6 months and three days from the initial DVD release date, it didn't work, and an email to Warner Bros. customer service essentially generated the response, \\"tough luck, read the fine print next time.\\"    I will be contacting the California Attorney General office about this...

This movie is amazing. I think everyone who likes those sci-fi thrillers (se7en type movies) , will enjoy this thoroughly. Its so good, each time I watch I notice something new or hidden. The faith element is what really made this movie for me, and I'm sure alot of people out there too.    Buy this movie, its worthy enough to keep physically in your collection.
0517543052|5.0|Ram Dass has written an excellent book for folks with an interest in buddhist thought, understanding the path.  The first section explains his background ~ Ph.D. & professor at Harvard and Stanford.  Brilliant.  The second part provides outlet for his creative right brain influenced by enlightened beings and LSD.  It is \\"really far out!!!\\"  The third section discusses methods of / practice that might lead one to awakening.  This is a fascinating foundational book, that at $10 is well worthwhile for both an understanding of eastern thought as seen by a westerner who had been using LSD and exposure to American counter~culture in the early 1970s.  It is recommended, but usually more for an academic appreciation than as a \\"how to\\" book.  I give it, as such, an A~.
B003P5CBNG|5.0|When I saw that GLEE only had two stars, I thought I was seeing things! Then I read the reviews, and they were about difficulties the viewers had with the streaming service - specifically the streaming of High Definition episodes. My first question to potential viewers (and the two viewers that already posted reviews) would be do you have a new(er) PC?  I watch alot of streaming videos on other sites, and have noticed that when it comes to HD videos, some sites are memory hogs. Amazon, I'm sure, has their own proprietary viewer. Maybe they haven't worked all the bugs out yet. I didn't have an issue with the video I watched(which was not this episode, and not HD).  My PC is four years old,  and plays regular videos great (great picture, great sound). It's only when I try to play HD videos that I sometimes have a problem - and that depends on the site.<br />If you have an issue with playing a video, contact customer support! That's what they are there for... and don't give a bad star rating to a GREAT SHOW, because you have a problem with the SERVICE. That makes us GLEEKS pretty upset!!!<br />HAVE A NICE DAY...  ;P
0312600844|1.0|This book was hardly deserving of the hype of the three-page review in The Sunday New York Times. Despite the book's length-- with its endless descriptions of the main characters--Patty, Walter, Richard, Joey, etc. never become real. Walter seems to change to suit immediate plot needs, and the depictions of the women, in particular Patty and Carol, are improbable and debasing. If you're seeking an enviro novel, try T.C. Boyle. And I wonder if Oprah/her staff realize that Franzen even disses Toni Morrison (p. 275)!
B002ZG97RE|4.0|This movie is hyped as \\"Matt Damon at his best,\\" and this is what is wrong with the movie. After enjoying Matt Damon in the Bourne series, where Damon is indeed at his best, this movie seems to be Damon lite. Although it is filled with many exciting moments, the actions pale in comparison to the Bourne series. A second problem is that I did not feel that the solution to the problem presented by the movie - can Damon show that Iraq does not have \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" - was resolved dramatically enough. I felt that the ending was weak, as if the writers could not think of a startling ending and simply has Damon send faxes.
0439023513|5.0|An excellent read. Some things happen that you wouldn't expect or might not want to happen, but the ending was sufficiently enough into the realm of the future that it doesn't leave you desperately guessing at what happened after everything is through with. And the person I bought from delivered far before the expected delivery date, which thrilled me :D
B001QOGYFO|3.0|This movie about a US Marshall trying to solve a murder in Antartica before she would be stranded in the cold for six months moves quickly, but not quickly enough. While one may find it hard to put his finger on what causes the movie to seem to drag, there is no doubt but that it does so.<br /><br />There is suspense. Why was the Marshall assigned to such a remote area? Who committed the murder? Why was it done? Will the Marshall discover the murderer in time?
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|With all the current fuss over Lady Gaga, it may be time to remember that Madonna did all of Gaga's stunts years ago, and with more originality. Having said that, Madonna's most recent album \\"Hard Candy\\" does reveal some desperation and lack of focus.<br /><br />The Timbaland/Justin Timberlake collaboration \\"Four Minutes\\" features Madge guest-starring on her own song, while pop confections like \\"She's not Me\\" and \\"Heartbeat\\" remind listeners of Madonna's better times (and better sales) in the 80s. Disco gem \\"Beat Goes On\\" and the funktastic \\"Give It 2 Me\\" aim for the core fanbase, and \\"Spanish Lesson\\" sets its sights on the Latin market. All told, this is a very commercially-calculated album, and basically an enjoyable pop record (despite the garish cover art), which is why it is so surprising that it basically flopped.<br /><br />Has Madonna's day come and gone? Or did she relinquish too much creative control on this release? It would be unwise to count her out (even during the current Gaga mania), but clearly it is time for yet another update to Madonna's sound and image. This was Madonna's final album for Warner Bros. (perhaps that explains her apparent lack of interest in the project), and perhaps this is the end of her major album career. Certainly she will continue as a major concert draw, but don't look for too many \\"Hard Candy\\" tracks in the setlist.

0767020308|4.0|If you liked the Gwyneth Paltrow \\"Emma\\", well, this one is a bit different.  Kate Beckinsale is truly stunning to look at, but the guy who plays Mr. Knightley is a homely little guy...NOTHING compared to Jeremy Northam!    That said, it's a decent adaptation.  Some scenes have almost exactly the same dialogue as the other Emma...but that makes sense, as it is the exact dialogue from the book.  If you can stomach the homely Mr. Knightley, you'll like this movie.

Its really sad when a great movie like this is over looked and so many other less deserving movies make money. if you have ever played a video game and read a comic book this is the movie you have been waiting for.

B003XMUFGQ|4.0|It has been an open secret for some time now among music enthusiasts that Eric Clapton has been coasting a bit on his solid, unimpeachable reputation.<br /><br />\\"Clapton\\" puts no deviation in that trajectory. This legend does not merely show up to the recording studio and phone it in - certainly not - yet he does work mostly within his box, sounding relaxed and at ease, making the music he wishes to. His choices are predictable, but mostly enjoyable.<br /><br />This is a set of well-polished, nicely honed tunes - covers and originals alike - that are easy to listen to, if not terribly difficult to turn off in favor of, say, 1992's \\"Unplugged.\\"<br /><br />Stone Clapton fans will certainly be pleased, of course, because his trademark sound - a sound that listeners are lucky to still have access to after all these years - is present throughout.<br /><br />Throughout this pleasing selection of tracks Clapton weaves blues-rock and southern-fried jazz with flourishes of old school R&B, burnished soul and rousing pop/rock. A few tunes meander a little too often such as \\"River Runs Deep\\" and Irving Berlin's \\"How Deep Is the Ocean?\\"<br /><br />Still, other selections - even ones that run beyond the 5-minute mark such as the uptempo \\"That's No Way to Get Along,\\" cannot wear out their welcome, especially with Clapton's trustworthy playing in the mix.<br /><br />He moves in-between the covers and original quite well, letting them bleed into each other, benefitting the cohesive feel of the album. However, some tunes like the overtly romantic \\"When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful,\\" nonetheless overstuffed with the spicy New Orleans-style instrumentation that is frequent among these tunes, sounds somewhat jarring due to surrounding songs that ground the album in a more serious context. Even so, it is awesome to hear him work in a variant of the classic Old Dixie combo sound.<br /><br />It is a fine moment to hear Clapton wrap his expressive, oaken voice around the immortal \\"Autumn Leaves\\" in thoughtful, ponderous fashion.<br /><br />New Orleans' own Allen Toussaint and Wynton Marsalis both show up to add flourish to the project, as do Sheryl Crow, Derek Trucks and, happily, Steve Winwood, who shared in Blind Faith with Clapton.<br /><br />A self-titled release often signifies a swap of sound or change in direction, but this is not the case with \\"Clapton,\\" nor need it be.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is an excellent television series that only aired two seasons thus far, but compliments the Terry Goodkind books Sword of Truth very well.  In many cases the TV show follows the books and in others it's like creating additional stories that the books didnt tell.  Its exciting to watch your favorite characters come to life on TV.  I sincerely hope that a movie is made as well.  Im sure the movie would be a paramount saga!

B0031QVW2U|5.0|A few months ago, I bought the Black Rapid RS7 Strap, and was almost very happy with it. The down side is that the strap would sometimes ride up when I swung the camera up to my eye. I bought the Arm Defense strap, and Lo! it solved my one minus point!  A very comfortable, confident feel when on and adjusted.  A minor downside is that it's a bit fussier to get on and in place. I wouldn't recommend it if you're going to be taking the strap on and off - especially if you're in a hurry.     All in all, it's a very worthwhile - and inexpensive - accessory. If you have an RS7 strap and like it; this is a must. If you are thinking of getting the main strap, get this along with it. Either way, you won't regret it.

However, I still think it's an enjoyable movie to watch, as it has its own style and charm to it. And the special effects are undeniably amazing in how they make Benjamin an \\"old baby.\\"    SEMI SPOILER ALERT: The only part of the story I found corny and \\"Hollywoodized\\" is when Daisy beds Benjamin after she's remarried. She should have stayed true to her husband, who was nobly raising Daisy and Benjamin's daughter. \\"I don't know why I'm here,\\" she says when she shows up at his hotel room...yeah, right... END SPOILER ALERT    Other than that, though, a fascinating story, and I loved all the various time-period settings. RECOMMENDED.

The statements, stories and observations are backed up with specific citations that can and should be confirmed for your own conviction of its veracity.   This is the third book I have read on the subject and I am impress with the depth, breath and accuracy of the information presented in this work.  The picture painted is not pretty, but must be faced if western civilization is to survive.

B0036ORISO|5.0|NME have rightly attached the above label to this hugely exciting Manchester band for very good reason. Anyone who has listened to British groups over the years like Teardrop Explodes, the Futureheads, Radiohead, the Wild Beasts and especially Swindon wonders XTC will be hugely comforted/delighted to get a copy of this excellent debut album and sink into its quirky, catchy, flamboyant and eclectic pop music without any traces of the residual Brit pop that passes for music in some of our so called best bands. \\"Man Alive\\" is an album which is as smart as an Armani suit and in parts as oddball as a 30 Rock on a good day. As such it creates a wonderful pot purri of sounds, infectious harmonies and hooks a plenty. It also oozes brazen confidence, for this is a band not afraid to mix it up and present their wares with sheer verve and thereby produce a musical Aladdin's cave.<br /><br />Contrast for example the text title opener and single 'My Kz Ur BF' with the later track \\"Leave the engine room\\". The opener is almost a LCD Soundsystem like funk monster stirred into a English context and is a start to a debut album to die for. It should spend so much time in the charts that an exorcism would be required to remove it. \\"Leave the engine room\\" alternatively is a dramatically slow and uplifting synth ballad which almost reminds me of Peter Gabriel era Genesis (nothing wrong in that) and should be downloaded post haste. In just two songs therefore you have enough potential to declare \\"Everything Everything\\" possibly the best new British band of 2010 but it doesn't end there. Previous single \\"Schoolin\\" does wear its Andy Partridge influences fairly openly on its sleeve but who cares and it remarkably manages to cross a number of genres through the course of its duration. \\"Qwerty Finger\\" is a headrush of a song which Franz Ferdinand would have died to have recorded and has a brilliant louche vocal from Jonathan Everything. Finally the albums stellar highlight is the slick giant \\"Suffragette Suffragette\\" a staggering pop song which matches anything on \\"Two Dancers\\" and which is full frontal assault on your senses. As it stands this review barely touches the sides of the wonders contained within \\"Man Alive\\" and it would be easy to write a review just on the twists and turns in the Lewis Taylor like \\"Come Alive Diana\\" which could have sat on his \\"Lost album\\".<br /><br />Overall when you add all the elements together even with the clear influences highlighted, \\"Everything Everything\\" are a band who sound like nobody else treading the boards at the moment. It is one of the most confident debuts to emerge from Manchester since that fateful day when and unemployed writer Steven Patrick Morrissey hooked up with a Johnny Marr, a failed footballer and aspiring guitarist. \\"Man Alive\\" is an album which is unafraid to be different. It can be arty and theatrical, it can be catchy and singalong. Most of all as a piece of recorded music it is utterly engrossing and captivating. Everything Everything have tapped in the best elements of British pop music, a tradition which is clever, smart, literate and sparkly fresh.gette Suffragette\\" a staggering pop song which matches anything on \\"Two Dancers\\" and which is full frontal assault on your senses.

B00005JMFQ|1.0|Don't bother with this movie.  Really.  Ignoring the advice of a friend who pooh-poohed it, I watched this film because I am a (somewhat casual) fan of several of the actors who appear in it and was curious.  Please believe me when I say that my friend was right - it is a complete waste of your time.      I don't say this because the story was pointless. (What story, really?  Eight or nine (?) subplots so tenuously connected that I was not even sure by the end of it how everyone knew everyone else.  How am I supposed to feel any connection with people when I'm still trying to figure out their names etc. two hours later?)    I also don't lay the accusation of pointlessness because none of the subplots actually worked, although that charge is true as well.  (For example: The Colin Firth character is supposed to experience a shocking, heart-wrenching break-up with a woman, leave the country to work on a book, get over said cheating/heart-breaking woman, meet a woman who speaks only Portuguese (of which language he knows not a word), say good-bye to her and return home, learn Portuguese, then fly back to find her and propose marriage (delivering this proposal in Portuguese - which he just learned)...all before Christmas day...yeah...right...And I'm the Queen of New York.    My main gripe about this film, though, was the horribly gratuitous level of sleaze - and I literally mean that it was gratuitous.  There were many instances (scenes, comments, conversations) that had nothing whatever to do with even the story-line of the sub-plot itself - neither forwarding action/informing the audience of new events, nor enhancing our knowledge of the characters (at least not in ways that could not just as easily, and more artistically have been accomplished by other methods).  The sex (lots of it - much of it disgustingly crass) was just there for the sake of it...and mysteriously, everyone in each scene apparently saw it as completely acceptable, or funny, or so commonplace as tonot merit comment.  There were quite a number of scenes in this film after which I found myself wondering \\"ok, why did I need to see that?\\"      The end result was that by the time the closing-credits were rolling, I had written off so many of the characters as either uber-shallow or as complete dirt-bags, that there were really only two characters that I liked - one was the kid (who was probably only saved from dirt-baggery by his age, and therefore implied innocence) and Emma Thompson's character (who is a Joni Mitchell fan, God bless her) and she turned out to be one of the victims of a love destroyed.... (Merry Christmas!!!)    I am a pretty hopeless sucker for a good romantic comedy - the category under which this movie was billed.  That is a misnomer.  It is not funny enough to be a comedy, and it is not at all romantic.  I think the director was trying to portray all the different (and often unexpected) ways that love can manifest itself in ordinary (or not so ordinary) life.  But I've seen real love in many forms - and that's not it.  The only true thing the director ended up showing us is that he (and anyone who loved this film) can honestly say with Joni Mitchell that they \\"really don't know love, at all.\\"
B003Y7L5W8|3.0|And so the finest band to emerge from the Synth Britannia era return. It is the first studio album since 1986's \\"[[ASIN:B0000072OH Pacific Age]]\\" to feature the classic line-up of Andy McCluskey, Paul Humphreys, Martin Cooper and Malcolm Holmes. The original 4-piece split acrimoniously in 1989, following the platinum-selling retrospective, \\"The Best of OMD\\", the previous year. McCluskey resurrected the brand to varying degrees of success in the 1990s, while Humphreys, Cooper and Holmes formed the ill-fated band, The Listening Pool, after failing in a bid to use the OMD name. Krautrock aficionados McCluskey and Humphreys, the electronic pioneers of such groundbreaking albums as \\"[[ASIN:B00008NF6J Architecture & Morality]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0013E4D9G Dazzle Ships]]\\", announced their reunion at a fan gathering in 2005 and consolidated this with successful tours between 2007 and 2009.     Many of the tracks had been demoed by McCluskey following his foray into the world of girl group songwriting for the likes of Atomic Kitten and Genie Queen. The current UK single, \\"If You Want It\\", seems to be a hold-off from this particular period. It was co-written by the girls' vocal coach Tracey Carmen who'd had a hand in the Kittens' \\"Be With You\\". It is permeated with lyrical clichés, while its musical template is unashamedly deeply rooted on the last OMD hit single, \\"Walking On The Milky Way\\", from 1996's \\"[[ASIN:B000005RQ3 Universal]]\\".     Perhaps a better choice of single would have been \\"Sister Marie Says\\", a close relative of \\"Enola Gay\\" that was part-written in 1981 and later recorded during the \\"Universal\\" sessions in the mid-90s. It was premiered at the previously mentioned fan event and dusted off by McCluskey for inclusion on the new album - it certainly improves on the original demo and brings the classic OMD sound up to date.    And so to the rest of the 13-track album:  On brilliant opener (and future US single) \\"New Babies: New Toys\\", OMD are fast out of the traps with a New Order-esque track that mirrors the aggressive nature of vintage album openers such as \\"Bunker Soldiers\\" and \\"The New Stone Age\\", with its rough-and-ready bass guitar and distorted vocals.  Its lyrical subject is Simon Cowell and the whole `X-factor' and `American Idol' culture (\\"It's better with the girls but it's bigger with the boys\\").  It has to be taken as being slightly tongue-in-cheek, given that McCluskey was responsible for manufacturing Atomic Kitten!    Whilst the momentum is slightly lost with \\"If You Want It\\", it is quickly restored with Part One of the two album title tracks. Originally titled \\"The Big Bang Theory\\", it expands upon some of the lyrical themes of the \\"Universal\\" single and marries the band's trademark choral effects with a memorable synth refrain.  Melodically, it does have some similarities to James' 1992 hit \\"Ring The Bells\\" but this doesn't detract from what is one of the highlights of this album.    Part Two of the title track, the first of three co-writes with co-founder Paul Humphreys, is slightly less memorable, and this particular version of the song frustratingly features some discordant out-of-tune synth sounds which didn't feature on the demo version.    Two other Humphreys co-writes, however, rate alongside some of the duo's best work.  \\"New Holy Ground\\", written and recorded in just a few hours, echoes \\"The Avenue\\" (the brilliant b-side of 1984's top 5 hit, \\"Locomotion\\"). It is a reminder of how McCluskey's melancholia used to be the perfect counterfoil to Humphreys' intricate, yet simple, melodies...before the financial allure of America caused the band to implode.  \\"Green\\", meanwhile, is rescued from the mid-90s vaults by Humphreys who applies some Vince Clarke-esque textures to a great lyric, and a beautiful coda.    Kraftwerk's influence is prevalent on at least three songs: Album closer, \\"The Right Side?\\", is a satisfying 8-minute electro-workout that mirrors elements of the German quartet's \\"Europe Endless\\" (andsamples fellow KlinkKlang enthusiasts Komputer), while \\"RFWK\\" (Ralf, Florian, Wolfgang, Karl) is a touching love letter to McCluskey's boyhood heroes. There's also a hint of \\"Hall of Mirrors\\" in the introduction to the aforementioned \\"New Holy Ground.\\"    Elsewhere, the waltz \\"Bondage of Fate\\", another lyrical highlight of the album, subtly incorporates elements of Hannah Peel's \\"Organ Song.\\"    Whilst there are highlights-a-plenty on this comeback album, there are also a few tracks that don't quite fit in.  I've already mentioned the ill-advised single \\"If You Want It\\", but elsewhere there is \\"Pulse\\", a frankly embarrassing attempt at a dancefloor filler which contains breathy, spoken word vocals from McCluskey (with backing vocals from Genie Queen, presumably the song's intended recipients).     And then there is \\"Sometimes\\", which sounds like a Moby tribute track (\\"Play\\" era), but with a piercing, wailing Macy Gray-like vocal from former Listening Pool backing vocalist, Jennifer John. US versions of the album also feature \\"Save Me\\", a mash-up of OMD's \\"Messages\\" and Aretha Franklin's \\"Save Me.\\"  It's an inoffensive dance track certainly, but does it belong on an album that is purportedly attempting to be \\"modern\\"?    There is also a distinct lack of musical invention on the Moroder-esque \\"The Future, The Past and Forever After,\\" another track retrieved from the 90s vaults (originally titled \\"Wheels of Steel\\").    Reading between the lines, this is basically another McCluskey solo album with some stylish overdubs and three songwriting contributions from Humphreys, a busy man in his own right with OneTwo, a project he formed with Claudia Brucken of Propaganda fame.      The new album lacks the lyrical focus of \\"Universal\\" and both the musical ambition and creative urgency of earlier albums.  There's an over-reliance on samples and, over all, it's a disjointed effort.  It has been labelled by McCluskey as their best collection of songs since \\"Architecture and Morality\\".  Sadly, that's just what this album is: a `collection of songs,' and it's certainly nowhere near as cohesive as their flawless 1981 magnum opus.
0765326353|5.0|I've read all of Sanderson's books. They have all been engaging, full of detail and intricate character development. Each book left me wanting to learn more (Elantris could use a follow up..). But The Way of Kings takes it to the next level. Sometimes almost too involved in the details, the complex characters truly come to life. Ready for the next one!

1439153663|5.0|I am sure there will be a lot of people who might be surprised with the title of my review, but I really believe this book surpasses \\"The Help\\" even though both are wonderful reads.     \\"The Kitchen House\\" is so well written that the reader is immediately engaged in the story and the characters come to life with each page.  I think the characters are even more realistic in this book and the author sure knows how to evoke all of your emotions in reading the book maybe more so than the other book mentioned.    I cannot say enough about this book except it is outstanding and I highly recommend it and would give it a 10 on a scale of 1-10!  Can't beat that!

These are all great movies to watch with your family.<br />So, get the box set and set dates that you and your family can enjoy watching them together.<br /><br />Update 2/2/11<br />I just wanted to let you know how the set is set up.  It comes in a cool box.  When you look on the right there is something you can pull out.  This is the box that the DVDs,Blu ray and digital copys sit in.  It looks like an old wagon.  The kind that was pulled by horses in the old west days.  In it, there is a black foam thing that takes the entire space.  It has slits for each disc to fit in.  They all fit snug.  Does not seem like anyone should have to worry about them falling out.  I kept the wagon in the case sitting on my movie shelf.

B000BW7QX6|5.0|This movie is hilarious as well as thrilling. I was not prepared (due to the slight humor of the characters) for the ending, which was as amazing as any movie with the best actors, directors and such of today.
B00433FQKO|3.0|Good musicianship here, good songs in general... However, I didn't feel like they're bringing anything new to the table.  Just updated 70s metal.  There are a couple of excellent tracks, however.  The album ends on a very good note, with the sprawling \\"Too Late For The Sun.\\"  At some points, I wanted the album to be over, but after that track, I wanted it to keep going.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|I savored every minute of the approximately eight hours of the miniseries.  The characters are not, as is too often the case in movies, animated cardboard cutouts, but real people.  The script is full of wisdom and humor.  Best of all it shows the early West in at least partially realistic terms.  It was a tough place, full of both good and bad people.  The portrayal of indigenous people is especially refreshing.  Instead of being time-travelers from the Green Peace movement as they are normally portrayed in modern movies, they are human beings.  Some are kind.  Some are cruel.  Some are just trying to get by.  Some are trying to defend their land and way of life the best they can.      And then there's the photography.  This film makes even Texas look beautiful!      I live in Thailand and it cost me a pretty penny to get this movie shipped here (Amazon doesn't allow online downloads to this country).  But it was worth every cent.  My own roots in the West go back to 1849 and my grandmother was the first Anglo baby to be born in my part of Wyoming, so I know from accounts of those who were there (albeit as young children) whereof I speak when I say that if you want to know what the real Old West was like, buy this movie.

B003EYVY0E|1.0|No extended cut?  Sorry, not interested.  I don't need a dressed up version of the same film I already own, I don't care how nice the box is.  Yes, the documentaries are good, but not enough to make me double-dip for the exact same films.  What's frustrating as a consumer is that I did get the first two Ultimate Editions, and was looking forward to completing the collection of extended cuts.  I know, I know...  The studio gave the directors a chance to re-edit their films, and both directors felt the film that exists was the best cut, ergo no extended cuts are necessary.  Nobody bothered to ask what the FANS actually want.  Crazy thought...  All I have to say is, they better not screw up the Order of the Phoenix Ultimate Edition.  Everyone KNOWS that film had a full HOUR of stuff cut, footage that had been COMPLETED with effects and everything.  So, you've got no excuses, WB!  You can still release GREAT editions of Phoenix, Half-Blood, and Hallows, even if you have messed up these two Ultimate Editions...can these sets even be CALLED \\"Ultimate\\" when they are exactly the same films sitting in my living room?
B000YABYLA|3.0|While there is nothing funny about a 16-year-old girl dealing with her unexpected pregnancy, Ellen Page portrayed Juno as a quirky teenager who was blatantly honest and surprisingly humorous.  Of all pregnant teen films, this was the most comical, however, the pain and consequences of making an adult decision came through loud and clear.    At first I didn't like Juno because she was a little difficult to understand, like she was speaking a different language known only to her peers.  Then she quickly became likeable because in spite of her mannerisms, her innocence showed through.  The girl was not street-wise, she was just a regular kid.  She wasn't flippant, she was actually overly practical and mature, and most of all, she had a character strong enough not to care what people thought of her.      She had a non-conventional, but loving and supportive family.  Her stepmother was funny, and I like the way her family called her June Bug at times.  And I loved the change of seasons and the constantly jogging football team, or was it a track team?    While it was cute and had a happy ending, I also found it to be sad and wished her family kept the baby until she was ready for it.  But then that would have ruined the effect that nothing is perfect, but that sometimes things work out anyway if we want them to.  It also was successful in showing that life goes on.
0545310601|4.0|I too, like many other reader, waited a long time for this book.  I read it within 2 days and at first, didn't feel great about it.  It left me feeling sad, emotionally drained and unsatisfied.  Then, after reading some of the other readers' views and allowing myself to not only to rethink why this book was written this way, but also how i should abandon a reader's tendency to gravitate toward \\"being told\\" how to feel, and \\"read between the lines\\", i felt much better.  As a whole, this trilogy was great.  I have to be honest and say MJ was not my favorite.  I will go into more details on that later, but I think Mockingjay was the appropriate ending to the trilogy.  If you're looking for a \\"complete spell-out -in your face\\" happy ending, this book will not satisfy you.   It's  a \\"bitter-sweet\\" ending and a lot are left to your own interpretations.  I think the author doesn't want to tell you how to feel, and she let you think for yourself.    Hunger Games was by far my favorite and Katniss was my favorite character; she wasn't supposed to be lovable and emotionally accessible, but she was strong and had a mind of her own and at times, seemed invincible.  And so it was frustrating to see our beloved character faltered and hiding in closets and \\"broken\\" in third book. But i understand why her character was behaving this way after what she has been through, she was human, not a fighting machine. Katniss was our heroin, and part of me wanted her to always be extraordinary, and it's easy to forget that she was only a 17 year old girl who has endured countless near-death experiences, lived under constant stress and threats.    As for the love story, i think the reason a lot of reader felt betrayed and angered was b/c the readers wanted some gratification after so much grief and violence and the rejoice in the end was very subtle.  Suz Collins could have given the audience a more \\"popular\\"  ending, but that i felt would cheapen the book.  Despite what many people think, i don't think Katniss settled for her romantic choice at the end.  It was always implied though out the series that he was \\"the one\\".  Though out their journey, she was always so afraid to admit it, b/c she thought \\"he was too good\\" for her, and i think mainly b/c she knew he only saw the goods in her and not the real her.  Only in Mj, when he saw her for the real her, the good and the \\"manipulative, selfish\\" side, that i felt that he truly loved her.     I think it is an extremely difficult task to write an ending to a beloved series that would satisfy most readers.  There are only a few authors that could write a remarkable bittersweet ending while staying true to the \\"spirit\\" of the series, one would come to mind is J.K. Rowling.  I was laughing and crying and savoring every page and every line of the last page of the 7th book.   That was a remarkable end book. I didn't feel that way for MJ.   Mockingjay gave the \\"appropriate\\" ending, and i gave it four stars for the trilogy as a whole and not just for M.J.  Everything that was implied and justified in Mj needed the first two books to make sense of.  One of the reasons why i didn't like this book as much as the first two were b/c it wasn't as \\"fun\\" to read.  And I know  the third book was meant to be \\"more serious\\", but it was lacking the humor that i loved in the first two.  With such a serious tone, i felt that it needed some levity to lighten it and balanced such \\"grayness\\" of their lives.  Also i was very moved by the first and 2nd book and although i was saddened  by what happened in MJ, i wasn't moved.   And I wanted to feel much more.  If you love Gale, you have to really reread the whole series, and try to find justifications in his characterization, to be pacified.  I believe that Katniss does love them both, in different ways and i felt that the love story of Gale and Katniss is a tragic one.  In the end, I do believe that she found her happiness.
B001U0HBQ0|1.0|I had my reservations about Benjamin Button, based on its fairy-tale plot; yet a man aging backwards while still being able to hold onto his childhood sweetheart was a compelling enough story for any skeptic.  That plus a Brad Pitt / Cate Blanchet casting, thirteen academy award nominations, and downright curiosity compelled me to watch this with high expectations.  But a quarter of the way into the movie, when I realized I would prefer watching a documentary on Watergate to this romantic fairy-tale, my expectations were dashed.  Yes, it is not a good day when I prefer Richard Nixon to Brad Pitt.<br /><br />Not even its Forrest Gump and Titanic reminders were enough to revive the long and drawn out plot that failed to reveal anything new about its mysterious main character.  Like Forrest Gump and the Titanic, its theme of an untimely love story surviving the test of time is apparent.  Unlike the two earlier films, however, there was little action or humor to sustain the test of time and nothing real to hold it together.  Though fictional, the Titanic centered around a real life, highly dramatic tragedy, while Forrest Gump humorously interacted with major historical events, without altering them one bit.<br /><br />Benjamin Button, on the other hand, centered around a fictional train station clock, created by a man who wished to turn back the hands of time to return his military son back from the dead.  What this man and his clock had to do with Benjamin Button was not explained, except that Button was born the moment World War I had ended.  He was born an infant with an old man's face and body ailments, but was he the clock maker's reincarnated son or just a casualty of the clock's spell?  Unlike a locket thrown back to sea, or a feather falling from the sky, the clock's connection to our hero wasn't clear and provided little closure to a not so well-rounded story.<br /><br />The clock came down near the end of Benjamin's life, but before he reached an infantile state.  Now consistent with his birth, Ben should have been the height of an old man with a baby's face when he died.  Instead, he was a perfectly normal looking baby who must have shrunk down in size considerably.  This did not make sense since he wasn't born the size of an adult.  Even fairy-tales need to hold onto some logic.<br /><br />In spite of its incomplete connections, the original story, makeup, special effects, costumes, and acting gave the film some merit - but not enough to pass the test of time, not even for the duration of the film.with his birth, Ben should have been the height of an old man with a baby's face when he died.

While this movie is about a totally dysfunctional family driving about a thousand miles to enter a child in a beauty pageant, the contest serves just as a focus point for the story.  The real entertainment lies within the family itself.  And what a family it is.    Headed by a man who lectures people to find the winner inside of them, we have a father trying to sell a nine-step theory to success.  Unfortunately, he practices what he preaches, much to the dismay of his household, consisting of his foul-mouthed, coke-snorting father; his nervous, chain-smoking wife; his gay, out of work, suicidal brother-in-law; his non-talking, self-disciplined son who claims to hate everyone; and his sweet, loving, seven year old daughter, whose only fault is her addiction to beauty pageants.      Being the most rational of them all, it's of course, the little girl who is responsible for bringing this clan together.  She doesn't have that much difficulty achieving this because in spite of their exterior, there is hope for her retched relatives.      Grandpa really loves his family and isn't afraid to tell them at various times in his own way.  Mom is a little passive, yet she says the right things at the right time.  The uncle is quick to bond with the kids in spite of his own troubles.  The big brother is very intelligent and eventually comes around, and Dad somehow manages to get his daughter to the contest on time.      While parts of it reminded me of vacation, the plot was surprisingly unpredictable, and the brilliant cast made these eccentric characters real enough to sustain the most far-fetched situations.  It had the right combination of elements: enough drama for conflict, enough sentiment to bond the characters, and lots of humor to carry it through.
0307454541|5.0|The author was able to keep multiple storylines going at the same time.  The main  characters were fully fleshed out & it was interesting at the same time. BTW, if you're looking for a cozy though, this may not be the book for you. There is some pretty gruesome stuff, but not overdone either.<br /><br />I loved this book & look forward to reading the next two. I think Larsson is as good as P.D. James. It's just sad that he didn't live long enough to see the success of this series.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Did you ever wonder how a toy got in a certain spot?  Did you ever look at a worn-out teddy bear and wonder what type of life it had?  Did you ever wonder what toys would tell us if they could speak? - Well, neither did I; but this movie will surely have you thinking.    For those of you who have seen the prequels to this movie, Andy, our one-time six-year-old human protagonist is now ready for college, and like most kids his age, he is closing one door to open another.  For a college kid, the doors are plentiful. - For old toys, it's more limited, as it's simply a matter of closing the bedroom door to open the attic door - if the toys are lucky.    Well Andy's beloved toys end up being luckier than most, as they managed to escape garage sales, garbage cans, and even the confined safety of an attic retirement village.  - But not before they have another adventure of a lifetime.  It's one that includes a psychopathic but sad teddy bear, his accomplice baby doll, a neurotic monkey, a knowledgeable telephone, a threatening incinerator, and enough Ken outfits to have made even Elton John jealous during his heyday - not to mention Barbie.     Andy matures, and so do his toys, as they not only have a bond with Andy, but to themselves, their new acquaintances, and the imagination of a new owner.  Towards the end of movie, we see Andy letting go of his toys - and his childhood.  But he and his toys fulfill their commitment to each other as both the human and his imaginary counterparts have a lot more living to do and love to offer - in their separate yet not-so-separate worlds.    This movie brings a lot of laughter, but also some tears, in spite of a happy ending.  Mothers sending their children off to college for the first time will end up bawling.  I know I did, even though I wasn't in their situation.  On the bright side, these parents will have less cleaning up to do after their children leave, because after seeing this movie, the college kiddies won't trust anyone else to pack up their cherished belongings.    Now, did you ever wonder if Ken was gay?  Personally, I think he's just misunderstood, but in addition to making you wonder, this film keeps the rumor - and humor - going.
0788859544|5.0|I purchased this movie for our 2yr old daughter.  She loves it!  She now calls herself \\"Princess Ariel\\" and her Daddy is Prince Eric.  How cute!  It bothers my Husband that Ariel openly defies her father. So we point out that Ariel is very naughty for not listening to her Father. Oh, and I always have to be Ursula!  Not sure how I feel about that! I would recommend it.  It seems to be one of the few actually good movies for young kids out there that doesn't have some political message hidden in it. It is just good entertainment for little ones and the music is fun!
B001PA0FFO|4.0|For a storyline not billed as a thriller, horror or adventure, this one had me hanging on the edge of my seat.  While the film doesn't fit in the prior classifications, there is enough vagueness about Father Flynn, mysteriously played by Philip Seymour Hoffman,  to capture all the elements of a good mystery.  Exactly who this man is, what background he came from, and what his intentions may be, are not fully revealed - and that's exactly how he wants it.      Perhaps the good Father relies on faith for those who wish to trust him.  Perhaps he prefers a sense of wonderment to revelation.  Or perhaps he's just a pervert pursuing Donald Miller, a young and vulnerable student and altar boy.  In any case the topics of his sermons, his tendency to avoid direct answers, and his slightly overgrown nails, are enough to arouse the suspicions of those far less curious than the persistent Sister Aloysius, played brilliantly by Meryl Streep.    But to what point do we rely on gut instinct over lack of factual evidence?  To what extent must we do the \\"right\\" thing in spite of personal consequences?  And what's the ratio of prevailing goodness to sins that are washed away?   This movie asks all these questions while attempting to answer none of them.    Therefore, for those liking well-rounded conclusions, then the ending may be a disappointment.  But if you believe as Alfred Hitchcock did that the greatest horror exists in the human mind, then I would highly recommend this drama.      Other than my disappointment that the Supporting Actress nomination wasn't an Oscar win for Viola Davis, who played Donald's mother, my only complaint was that the movie was too short.  I was still hanging onto my seat waiting for more.  But then if I got it, it might have ruined my sense of doubt.
0312857063|1.0|Without question the worst seller I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I purchased three books each from a different seller. The first was an older book but was obviously never read or opened. The second was a very new print. This one however was printed the same time as the first but there was a book mark in it, the spine was worn, the back of the book was bent and some of the page corners where folded or dented. Did I mention the moisture damage? So I asked for an actual new one. Turns it was the only book she had. I was told to send the book back in the packages that she sent the book in. Unfortunately the package she sent it in was a plastic bag from Fedex and no other packaging. It could not be resealed and I did not want her to blame me for any of the damage so I had to ship it back myself. I was only refunded my original purchase and was not refunded the return shipping nor has she responded to my last email.
B002JVWRAY|2.0|Supernatural for the past four seasons has been a really exciting series but unfortunately, the fifth season leaves much to be desired. The story arc is very plodding and the finale, which should have been the end of the series, apparently is not.<br /><br />(Spoilers ahead)<br /><br />PROS: 1) Some humorous episodes like \\"Swap Meat\\".<br /><br />CONS: 1) Most of the episodes focus on one or the other brothers getting possessed (mainly), Castiel looking for God, and other apocolyptic events. It keeps going on and on about the brothers getting possessed, which gets extremely tiresome after the first couple of episodes.<br /><br />  2) People die and then suddenly are back; it is almost \\"cartoonish\\" in that no one can die (permanently) and the episodes generally end with things back the way they were at the start of the episode.<br /><br />  3) The \\"Apocalypse\\" really isn't that much of an Apocalypse. Various storms and what not, but that's about it. Chicago apparently gets spared because it has good pizza. (Seriously????)<br /><br />  4) The \\"Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\\" are really not that great and don't inspire fear or terror. The personification of War basically causes one town's population to turn on each other - no nuking or other major event. Famine makes people hungry unless they are \\"dead inside\\" and then they are immune. Pestilence actually was the only one who seemed to have a plan for the Apocalypse (the plan was a bit lack-luster at that). Death was like \\"can you get me out of this situation?\\" Seriously folks, I expected better.<br /><br />  5) The series should have ended the way it was looking like it was up until the very end when they show Sam outside Dean's home. Should have been Dean narrating while inside his home and then fade to black. End of Series.<br /><br />  To be honest, I pre-ordered this set prior to watching all but a couple of the episodes and I had high hopes after the first four seasons, only to have those hopes dashed. This show could have ended on a much higher note than it did and the fact that it is continuing on to a sixth season does not fill me with confidence.e than it did and the fact that it is continuing on to a sixth season does not fill me with confidence.
054531058X|5.0|Hunger Games is one of the best written books I have ever read.  Suzanne Collins truley knows how to grab you attention and put your mind into that \\"whats next\\" gear.  I could not put this book, Catching Fire and Mockingjay down until I had read them.  Wonderful plot, very engrossing and a stroy that makes you wonder....could this really happen??  One of the best trilogies I have ever had the privilage to read.
054531058X|4.0|\\"Wow\\" is the feeling after reading this book.  What an imagination ... Very touching at some points.  Don't think it is good for kids since lots of killings occurred.  Overall, I think this is a great book to read.
0061122416|1.0|I cannot fathom what anyone sees in this book.  It's strewn with adolescent moral and ethical challenges, two-dimensional characters, and an ending that makes it clear the author had no idea where he was going.  For those who gave this five stars, how would you rate \\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\\" or \\"Fifth Business\\" or countless other novels with extraordinary depth that challenge the reader at every turn?
B001NFNFNU|5.0|As it started in 1928, this film did an excellent job of recreating an era reminiscent of our parents' and/or grandparents' time.  It was the good old days of model-T fords, switchboard operators, and steel wheel roller skates in a time when role models were structured, the air was purer, and life was sweeter.  Unfortunately, it was also a time before nation-wide Amber alerts, a time when shock treatment was standard for psychiatric patients, and when authority went basically unopposed.    This was the setting of Angelina Jolie's surroundings in what was a well-deserved academy award nominated performance of the real life Christine Collins, a woman whom the L.A. Police returned the wrong kidnapped son.  In spite of overwhelming evidence supporting Collins' objections, the chief of police insisted she was over-reacting from the traumatic experience of the kidnapping and had her committed to a mental hospital.  Better that than admitting the possibility that she was right and they were wrong.    As a single parent who was also a career woman, Christine Collins was ahead of her time.  So was the radical, but compassionate minister who fortunately was interested in her case.  Together they managed to release her and all the other wrongfully admitted patients who were also committed to the hospital by the power of police brutality.  They brought down the police force in court, giving the story an uplifting ending, leading the way for hope.      For the realistic portrayal of the times, the horror of the events, and the acting from Jolie down to her youngest co-stars, this is a classic portrayal of a true-life event.  Viewers could walk away wondering how much things have changed and how much they stayed the same.  There's still abuse of power and wrongfully accused and committed victims, but more importantly, there's still the possibility that a few strong and dedicated people standing up for what is right can still make a difference.
0439023491|5.0|This one was better than the first!  Katniss is still herself but her entire world has changed.  Now she has a new home and money from her battles in volume 1, and we see her use these gifts toward good.  We also find out just a bit more about her Mother and Madges' Mother as well.<br /><br />Gale is too absent, but Peeta is ever-present and strong.  The twists and turns make this a fun ride, and the new characters are an interesting lot.  The games this time were easier for me to follow and enivision.  Suzanne Collins comes up with inventive ways to keep the action moving along.<br /><br />I've read the reviews for Mockingjay and now I'm afraid to read it.  Considering this book was so good, I have to linger in this place for a bit longer before I pick up volume 3.
B00168OINK|5.0|It was in great condition when it was delivered. I watched it right after I received it, without any problems :)The movie itself is also great, even for adults to watch.
B003PIUC02|5.0|First, the package is hard to get disk out and easy to put them back.  Use care and you will have no problems.  Now to the storyline itself, it is loosely based upon fact so take it for what it is.  In the days this series is set, violence was a way of life.  Slaves were used and abused.  In the arena life and death were just accepted.  So the blood (lots of it) was spilled and the crowds did cheer.  This is not the ways of today (dog fights, cock fights excepted).  The story moves forward in each episode and by the end of the first season the ground work has been established for the next.  If you take the characters and look you will find the same people today.
0307387178|5.0|When I read Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer, as I have twice now, I find myself criticizing the subject rather than the writer. The book is the story of Chris McCandless, a twenty-four year old man from a well-to-do family who hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the bush. He died there, leaving behind a family he hadn't spoken to in more than two years and bewildered friends and acquaintances he met along his travels.    The book chronicles his approximately two-year hike across the United States. He hitchhiked, tented, slept in the desert, and somehow settled on the idea that a summer in the Alaska bush would--if not change it--give his life a deeper meaning. In his mind, he was following the path of the writers he loved, most notably Jack London. But he also emulated Tolstoy in his lofty ideals: McCandless was one who seemed to believe, as his father put it, \\"that you should own nothing but what you can carry on your back at a dead run.\\" Chris reveled in scrounging for the next meal.    To me, as someone who has been poor and will be poor for the foreseeable future, McCandless's endless romanticization of the hobo lifestyle smacked of unbelievable self-absorption and hypocrisy. Here was the son of a man who had top-secret security clearance and a mother who worked alongside her husband to create a successful business. He had excelled academically all through school and could have the job of his choice or create his own business fairly easily. Only someone as well-to-do with such an easy path paved before him could believe he was a better person than the \\"plastic people\\" with whom he was forced to share breathing space (such as the people with whom he briefly worked at McDonald's--many who were not financially much above poverty) by hoboing around the country.     But perhaps I am being harsh; McCandless was young and no more hypocritical than I was at his age. And Krakauer, by telling his own story of his relationship with his father, which led to his harrowing climb ofAlaska's Devil's Thumb, brings the reader to a more compassionate view of McCandless: he was young and brash and ill-prepared and perhaps even foolish, but he was not stupid, and his death was the result not of his dramatically heeding a \\"call of the wild,\\" but of two small errors that turned out to be pivotal and irreversible.     At any rate, Krakauer is a fine, fine writer, and he tells McCandless's story as only a young man who had a similar relationship with his father as Chris did to his can. Yet in the book he is gentle with Chris's parents, writing about them as non-judgmentally as he does about Chris. It's clear that the wisdom he came to in his own life somewhere along the line parallels that of Chris's, only there's a point where Chris's line stops and Krakauer's keeps going. Krakauer was lucky to have survived his own brush with death and not only live to tell the tale, but forgive his father--something McCandless will now never have the opportunity to do.
0312600844|1.0|This is a tedious boring book about depressed boring people.   Do not believe the hype.  I took it on a weekend trip and was almost crying that it was my only book.      The Democrats and the Republicans are equally silly and the author clearly has not spent much time in DC, yet he has set the second half of the book there.   Politics enters the story about half-way through, as though the author became bored with good-old story telling and needed an excuse to start ranting, which never makes for good reading.
0345505387|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book. I bought it out of curiosity and I was pleasantly surprised. As much as I love Diana's books what impressed me more about Exile was the artwork. I love the images Hoang has created for a story I already knew. Hoang was a perfect match for Diana on this project. With each re-read I find new details I hadn't seen before the same way I find new details in Diana's books after the first read through. Thank you for introducing me to graphic novels.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this first book in 2 days.  I know it's a Young Adult novel, but just like Harry Potter, it drew me in.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins' writing makes it easy to visualize District 12, the trip to the Capitol and the games themselves.  When this becomes a movie, and I'm sure it will, I can't wait to see how they create Cinna's outfits.<br /><br />Katniss is a likeable, humble hero.  Gale and Peeta are perfect for the love triangle.  And, this is such an interesting look into the future.  I can't wait to see how this trilogy evolves!
0446615625|5.0|Even though I read the two books that follow this book before I read Camel Club, I still really LOVED this book. DB is awesome! This book was like watching a very good movie. Everything flows so well and the plot never gets dull.
0767834739|4.0|Now we get to the second movie in the Resident Evil movie franchise.  While I would think that doing a second movie would be a little difficult to do knowing that there was 2 stories that occurred in the Mountain City of Raccoon.  There was Leon & Claire that had to survive through the city let alone, Jill Valentine had to go through the city herself.  Although the 3 had their own battles that they had to deal with and knowing how to deal with what would be put in from those games I think had to be a difficult decision.  Though we get some of the characters that we got to know from the games like Jill Valentine, along with a couple of the S.T.A.R.S. Mercenaries, though one of them was written differently for the game.  Not only that we get, my personal favorite baddie, Nemesis put in the movie, and he's just about just like his video game counterpart in Resident Evil 3.  Although the movie does pick up where the first movie left off, yet the Umbrella Corporation tries what they can to contain the virus but can containing it be more than they bargained for?<br /><br />I like that there's more zombies in this movie than compared to the first movie, though it's in the city this time around so they could be able to pull that off, though at the same time they made the city almost just like in the games.  While the story itself is a little different than that of the games, just like with the first movie and there are things that are in the movie that the fans will be able to recognize as they watch the movie.  After all that, the features that come with this package, it's nice to see what was left out as well as some of the things that went into making the movie, which should be good if you like seeing what done to make the movie possible.  Overall I give 4 stars out of 5.
0307454541|4.0|Here's the Big Debate about this novel: Is it misogynistic in its depiction of violence against women or is its depiction of violence against women an indictment of misogyny?<br /><br />People can debate all they want about the violent scenes, but all I can say is: These people sure drank a lot of coffee. It seemed like every page someone was making coffee, or drinking coffee, or asking someone if they wanted coffee. It left me wondering if Sweden is the only country in Europe that drinks coffee instead of tea. Do these people pour it on their breakfast cereal? I'll never know if Larsson was a misogynist, but I'll bet my bottom dollar he had a caffeine addiction.<br /><br />If you're in the camp that he was making an indictment of misogyny, you could argue it comes in the form of Lisbeth Salandar, a scrawny, twenty-four year-old ward of the Swedish court. She's misread by everyone around her as completely socially inept and quite possibly mentally challenged; consequently she misreads herself as a freak. (She's not.)<br /><br />At first glance she seems harmless. She's young, she's tiny, she seems defenseless. But she's gifted with computers and even better researcher. She's not one to forgive and she sure as hell isn't one to forget. Cross her and she will extract her revenge in imaginative ways.<br /><br />One day she is hired to investigate Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist recently convicted for libel. He in turn has been hired to investigate the disappearance of a rich debutante. Eventually Blomkvist figures out Salandar hacked him, and instead of being pissed, he hires her to handle aspects of the investigation he dare not go as a journalist.<br /><br />During the course of the novel, they become lovers, but there's also the fine, fragile bloom of a friendship underneath, and Larsson makes this 90-pound waif the unabashed hero. Maybe he was only trying to give this mystery novel a good twist, but Larsson was, in a popular-novel-entertaining way, making an indictment against misogyny.<br /><br />Whichever it was, I'll bet you anything that when he sat down to write, he held a cup of coffee.as, I'll bet you anything that when he sat down to write, he held a cup of coffee.
0141192410|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

B003YBNRHU|5.0|I'm a long time Doobie fan from the 70's. I'm glad for some new Doobie Brother's music which is long over do. The Doobies are a fantastic band and have been putting out great rock for years. As others said, there is something for everyone on this CD. An couple of good surprises is the duet with Pat Simmons and Wille Nelson. Another great is Michael McDonald doing a Tom Johnson song. The Doobie's rock with each band member giving it there best. Pat, Tom, and the gang are great on this CD which I highly recommand.
0312600844|5.0|At 500+ pages, Freedom is nevertheless a quickly-read page-turner. It will have you plough on eagerly, sit back in admiration, and at times chuckle. Franzen took seven years to write it (that's about half a page a day), and it shows. Freedom is good because it feels true. Or, and this may be the same thing, because it looks at its characters from every perspective, good and bad.     Freedom tracks the varying fortunes of Patty and Walter, the Berglund family around them and their friends, especially the struggling alt-rock star Richard Katz. The book is being hailed by critics, in what had been thought was a passé endeavour, as the great American novel - by which is meant that it connects psychological and wider societal issues. If America is the land of the free, what is all this freedom actually for? And is one freer within the system, or living one's life without / against it? But the 'great American novel' label is worth considering for its limiting as well as its positive implications. Franzen is not, for example, Saul Bellow, with his metaphysical breadth, his rambling but penetrating erudition. More like a steadier Roth, just as angry but more compassionate, writing in a more matter-of-fact voice. Freedom is not devoid of irony. It is even acid, at times, about America and the kind of place it is. But it is more private than public drama. And its strength is in its humanity, as well as in a carefully crafted Russian-doll of a plot which keeps the pace going to the very end.    Freedom deserves quoting. In the following scene, the failed Liberal parents (Joyce and Ray) are meeting the heroine's (Patty) new fiancé (Walter) for the first time: 'Joyce and Ray, to their credit, and perhaps in their secret relief that Patty had turned out to be heterosexual (secret because Joyce, for one, stood ready to be strenuously Welcoming to Difference), were on their very best behaviour. Hearing that Walter had never been to New York, they became gracious ambassadors to the City, urging Patty to take him to museum exhibitions that Joyce herself had been too busy in Albany to have seen, then meeting up with them at Times-approved restaurants, including one in SoHo, which was then still a dark and exciting neighbourhood. Patty's worry that her parents would make fun of Walter gave way to the worry that Walter would take their side and not see why they were unbearable to her: would begin to suspect that the real problem was Patty, and would lose that blind faith in her goodness which already, in less than a year with him, she had rather desperately come to count on. Thankfully Abigail [the sister], who was a high-end restaurant hound and insisted on turning several of the dinners into awkward fivesomes, was in peek disagreeable form...'
B003MZ0I84|2.0|Well, the songs probably won't wow you, even if the sexy album artwork does.<br /><br />Maroon 5's new album Hands All Over is okay.  In my opinion, It Won't Be Soon Before Long was superior in the sense that it had more bite to both the lyrics and the instrumentals.  It was sexy and made you move in spite of yourself.  If that album was a tiger, then this one is its purring kitten cousin.<br /><br />\\"Misery\\", the single from the album, probably has the most life and funkiness of the conglomerate.  This is an example of what we have come to expect from Maroon 5.  It translates well into an acoustic track, (included separately on the album) and Adam Levine's vocals really shine when backed with just hand claps and faint guitar.<br /><br />\\"Last Chance\\" and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" are the live tracks of choice for this album.  \\"Not Coming Home\\" from Songs About Jane was preferable to me, personally.  \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is a cover of, yes, the Alicia Keys hit.  The band doesn't do a bad job with it.  I'd prefer this track to \\"Last Chance\\", which is a rather vanilla pop track.<br /><br />Some of the better tracks here would include the title track, \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" and \\"Get Back in My Life\\".  These seem to have a bit more passion behind the emotions and invite us in.  The acoustic version of \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" appearing later on in the album helps it come into its own, while \\"Don't Know Nothing\\" carries a bit of the old-school Motown sound.<br /><br />The band's cover of Queen's \\"Crazy Little Thing About Love\\" is surprisingly well done.  It's not Freddie Mercury, but it'll do.  \\"Just a Feeling\\" is a sweet break-up ballad whereas \\"Give a Little More\\" reminds me of the days of disco.<br /><br />Lady Antebellum guest stars on \\"Out of Goodbyes\\" which seems like quite the odd pairing, doesn't it?  The song isn't awful but hearing the country twang behind Levine's vocals is something I'd definitely need to accept over time.  Hillary Scott and Levine sing quite well together, though, I must admit.<br /><br />This album is definitely lighter on its feet.  It possesses a lot less funk and is a bit of a sleeper.  If someone was new to Maroon 5 and asked for suggestions, I wouldn't start them off with this one.his album is definitely lighter on its feet.

B000YPUF9W|3.0|The third movie in the Resident Evil franchise, and now the T-Virus has `apparently' spread throughout the world in just a matter of months.  There aren't many survivors left, and whatever survivors are out there have to remain on the run, due to if they do, they won't last that long.  While a small handful of characters, returned in this move while we get some new characters along the way, like Claire Redfield for example.  While in the games she was looking for her brother Chris, though in the movie it doesn't seem like she's trying to look for him due to not one mention of Chris in the movie.  Though there is one character that finally made an appearance in this movie that I felt was a little overdue, and that's Albert Wesker.  I was hoping that there would have been a mention of him in the first or second movie, though I wonder as to why they decided to save him for this movie.<br /><br />The story itself seems that they decided to try something new with this movie, instead of trying to keep up with the game story other than that Umbrella was involved through the movie, still ticking.  Though that the zombies are still about in the movie, Dr. Issacs is trying to research in what reversing what the T-Virus had left behind, but all in all he ends up becoming like obsessed and leading to his ultimate demise.  While Alice manages to help out her new friends, then has decided to go after, the one that made what Umbrella done, and that's Wesker himself.  Some of the features are nice, though there aren't much besides some deleted scenes and some behind the scene footage, along with a preview of the CGI movie `Resident Evil: Degeneration'.  Overall I give it a 3.5 stars out of 5.

0061433047|4.0|Tiffany Aching is the witch of Chalk, which means that she has to do all the messy rural stuff that witches do. But witches aren't always as appreciated as they should be, and Terry Pratchett's \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" flings the sensible young girl -- and the Nac Mac Feegles -- against a threat that really, really doesn't like witches.<br /><br />Tiffany is doing the usual witchy rounds in Chalk -- nursing the sick, burying the dead, watching cheese races, and rescuing the occasional girl from an abusive father. Then the local Duke expires after a long illness, and it's up to Tiffany to tell his son Roland and his \\"watercolour-painting wife-to-be\\" about what happened.<br /><br />The problem is, she's being stalked by a creepy eyeless man with a vile psychic stench, who is inspiring people to hate and distrust witches. Suddenly stones are being thrown, accusations are being made, and Tiffany even finds herself in the Ankh-Morpork jail. And if Tiffany doesn't find a way to stop the Cunning Man, things will get very toasty for the witches...<br /><br />Due to having Alzheimer's disease, Terry Pratchett had to dictate \\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" instead of the usual computer typing. As a result, the book's beginning is very rambly and scattered, as if Pratchett hadn't fully thought out how the plot was going to go -- but after the Duke's death, things start to tighten up and move faster.<br /><br />And Pratchett hasn't lost any of his delicious wit, whether it's poking fun at cliches (the cackle box!) or sharp dialogue (\\"Have you boys got no shame?\\" \\"I couldnae say, but if we have, it probably belonged tae somebody else\\"), or his knack for writing truly chilling moments, such as Tiffany seeing the Cunning Man's holes-where-his-eyes-should-be, or the almost palpable darkness as hatred starts to take over people's hearts.<br /><br />But unlike authors who talk down to \\"young readers,\\" Pratchett doesn't shy away from realistically dark moments, like Tiffany caring for a girl who was badly beaten by her father until she miscarried. These parts -- and the \\"rough music\\" -- are more horrifying than the Cunning Man.<br /><br />Tiffany herself is a very realistic depiction of a sensible, mature, no-nonsense young lady (like a younger version of Granny Weatherwax). While Pratchett occasionally reminds us that she IS still young (and prone to little stabs of jealousy), she grows up a great deal in this book. And there are some hints of romance with a young guard (who can pronounce the word \\"marvelous\\").<br /><br />\\"I Shall Wear Midnight\\" is an excellent -- possibly final -- entry in Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching series.

B0000047CX|5.0|Buy this CD.  Seriously, just buy it and listen to it.<br /><br />This classic combines smooth jazz with Bossa Nova.  You will suspect this was just recently made.  Getz's jazz saxaphone unobtrusively blends in with the bossa nova and samba music.  If you like latin music (salsa, cumbia, chamame, tango, tex-mex, or something else) you will appreciate this CD.  If you like jazz (traditional, smooth, avante-garde, etc.) or rock and roll or R&B or soul, or most anything else, then this is for you.  You can play it as background music for dinners or cocktails, or just play it to listen and dance (OK: this would be slow dancing rather than head bangind metallica) or just to chill while sipping wine, drinking beer, or savoring a caipirina.<br /><br />Regardless of your musical background you will probably like it.  People from different cultures accept it.  While living and working in Central and Eastern Europe so many people commented on liking the music (Czech, Austrian, Hungarian, Bosnian and Croatian) that I used to give out copies as presents.  Mexican, Greek and Colombian friends liked it.  A Puerto Rican friend turned me on to this record in 1979 or 1980.<br /><br />As you listen to the music you soon imagine being beach-side, the sun's rays beating down on you, the slight ocean breeze ruffling your hair and that of the pretty women you are trying to avoid staring at while you notice the seagulls crying in the distance sometimes louder than the crashing waves, sometimes not, and the scent of coco oil, and other tropical aromas, flavors and sabores.<br /><br />While listening to this you may also suddenly imagine a perfect romantic time or place with a loved one, real or imagined.<br /><br />If for some reason you don't like the cd, give it to a friend, or better yet hold on to it, your musical tastes will mature so that you appreciate this.  Or maybe after listening to it a thousand or more times you tire of it.  Just stash it away for a while and after a few months you will be pawing through your CD collection looking for it again.<br /><br />R.H.Curtis [...].<br /><br />Looking for a present for your parents?  or friends?<br />Buy this CD!

B003L77TZI|3.0|Don't be fooled by that awful \\"California Gurls\\" single.  This album doesn't need a fluffy, Ke$ha-sounding pop tart track infused with some Snoop to promote the decency.  \\"E.T.\\" would have been a way better choice, (despite its sounding like it was produced by t.A.T.u).<br /><br />Katy Perry is probably best described as the P!nk for the teenage girls sector.  She has enough bubble gum flavor on her tracks to appeal to the younger minds but she has enough honesty and personal experience in her lyrics for girls who are seeking a big sister's advice.  She could even be considered a milder Lady Gaga, considering her costumes and bisexual curiosity.<br /><br />But enough of what she could be and on to what she is.  Perry is, through these lyrics, a girl who has been hurt by a man she loved.  Perry is now a strong woman who \\"used to be a shell\\".<br /><br />Perry has attitude.  She has something to say and she's going to make sure you hear it.<br /><br />Teenage Dream is a strong follow-up to One of the Boys.  Perry still maintains her cutesie sweetness and it seems almost as if Perry is permanently stuck in her teenage years.  It's hard to believe that such a fun-loving party girl with a juvenile state of mind is going to be a married woman soon.<br /><br />\\"Not Like the Movies\\" is one of my favorite tracks on this album.  Here, Perry gets more personal than ever before, with lyrics describing a first sexual encounter that is nothing like fairy tales promised.  It hurts, physically and emotionally, and now she knows when she will be ready for the right one because now she knows what not being ready feels like.  Her breathy sadness here will touch you and make you remember feelings you may have long forgotten.<br /><br />\\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" is a rocker akin to \\"Waking Up in Vegas\\" from her first album, only with the last remaining traces of innocence stripped clean.  On \\"Circle the Drain\\", Perry expresses delicious anger.  This is not a song you would want to blast at work.  Well, unless explicit lyrics are allowed where you work.  The title track has the hook to grab you in but it's inferior to some of the other work here.  \\"Pearl\\" reminds me of \\"Dance in the Dark\\" by Lady Gaga since it is yet another song about a girl who has potential and a lot of life in her but is held down by the man in her life who fears her power.<br /><br />\\"Who Am I Living For?\\" is an excellent display of Perry's vocals laced over that all-too-addictive Timbaland beat.  This is my favorite track on the disc, hands down.  \\"Peacock\\", however, is mainly a miss.  At first listen, it reminded me of \\"Mickey\\" by Toni Basil if it was re-done by Gwen Stefani.  A girl with her emotional depth does not need to rely on such a stupid expression of suggestion.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is an excellent second album for Perry.  She demonstrates growth here, a willingness to change her sound up without going overboard.  If you liked the first album, I strongly suggest this one.  And if you didn't, this album may just change your mind about her.where you work.

B0002J4X1Q|3.0|Resident Evil makes its way onto the big screen after all the times of having games on since the PlayStation since 1996.  While the movie you'd think it would go about following the first movie, but instead it's more of a prequel to the first game.  One of the things that I like about the movie, is that with the camera angles they make the movie feel like if it was a game but in a live action kind of way.  Although the story itself, does go about trying to give the fans, something new to look forward to and not a movie where everyone is going to know what's going to happen next.  Milla Jovovich, plays as `Alice' who from the start of the movie doesn't know who she is or what she did, though her memory starts coming in towards the end of the movie thus proving to be a nice story to the Resident Evil.  By the end of the movie, there'll be a bit of a twist although at the same time you'll recognize that something big is going to be set up for the next movie.  Some of the features that they have in this DVD are nice to see how the transition from game to movie was done.  Overall I give this 3.5 stars out of 5.
0920668372|1.0|I thought this would be a nice (if cheesy) story of the unconditional love of a mother for her child.  I was shocked when I got to the end, and promptly turned to my infant son and promised that I will never crawl into his room when he is a teenager and pick him up out of bed, and that I will never drive across town in the middle of the night and break into his house.  This is a story of a dysfunctional mother/son relationship, not a touching tale of unconditional love...and the dysfunction is not even veiled.  It's glaring.  The illustration of the woman rocking her adult son after breaking into his house is CREEPY.  As I explained to my son: I will love him forever, but that is not what this book is about.    Instead of this book, I would recommend [[ASIN:0439553768 Goodnight, My Angel: A Lullabye (Book & Audio CD) (CD: Goodnight, My Angel)]].  Like Love You Forever, it is a book about a parent's love for his/her child and about love through the generations.  Unlike Love You Forever, it does not have creepy undertones.
0141192437|4.0|\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a unique story in the Sherlock Holmes canon -- author Arthur Conan Doyle wrote it in the years between Holmes' death and his resurrection several years later.<br /><br />But due to public pressure, Doyle brought Holmes and Watson back temporarily for a sort of \\"memoir\\" tale, a tale of supernatural curses, escaped convicts and ghastly glowing hounds. It suffers a little from a lack of Holmes, but is otherwise a tightly-written, solid little mystery.<br /><br />Sir Charles Baskerville was found dead of a heart attack -- apparently killed by a family curse in the shape of a giant dog. So his pal Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to protect Charles' heir, Henry Baskerville, who has just arrived in England to claim his estate and inheritance.<br /><br />But even without Holmes, Watson can tell that something is up -- secretive servants, peculiar neighbors, an escaped criminal, a giant quicksand marsh, and the sounds of a dog howling in the night. But Holmes knows that the curse is no supernatural hound -- and that Sir Henry is in danger from a more real kind of ancient enemy.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" stumbles in one area -- the relative lack of Holmes. He's out of the picture for most of the book, and Watson does plenty of solid detecting on his own. Everybody loves the faithful narrator, but Watson isn't the Great Detective, and the book feels vaguely incomplete without Holmes inspecting clues and giving little hints to Watson.<br /><br />The mystery unfolds at a languid pace, dropping a few red herrings along the way. Doyle pays loving attention to the dangerous, almost surreal Grimpen Mire and the surrounding countryside. But when Holmes comes back onto the scene, the book tightens itself up. All the plot threads rapidly slip into place as the real \\"hound\\" is uncovered.<br /><br />Holmes' steel-trap mind is untarnished here, especially when he reveals what he figured out at the end. He's especially likable in an endearing scene at the beginning, where he educates Watson on deduction. But this is Watson's turn to shine, since he spends a long time gathering clues and even solving a sub-mystery without any assistance.<br /><br />\\"Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is a short, satisfying Holmesian mystery, which is only hampered by Holmes' absence for about half the book.

B003VJTGLQ|4.0|There's no doubt that American Beauty is a great movie.  I feel that the video quality of the Bluray could have been better.  There are scenes that look great but it's not consistent throughout the movie.  I would give the video quality a 3/5.  Also, I wish there were more extras.  Since this is called a \\"Sapphire\\" release, you would think they would give you more.
B002OEBMN4|2.0|What to say..They have been doing it for over 20yrs, and I have been with them since the release of \\"Reign in Blood\\". I watched what they did for Thrash, continued to pound out agressive Material when Thrash Metal was declared dead, and was impressed by the last release \\"Christ Illusion\\" the most brutal lyrically since \\"Hell Awaits\\" The only album that I didnt care for was \\"God Hates us Al'\\" which I gave 3.5 stars to. \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\" isnt my favorite either, very strange, I know, most everyone loves it, I still think \\"South of HEaven\\", \\"Reign in Blood\\", & \\"Hell Awaits\\" Destroy it, but ANYWAY, back to \\"World Painted Blood\\" For whatever reason, it just doesnt sound like Slayer. Its not like Slayer has tried to move in another direction, its still Slayer, but most of the songs on this album, are well Boring... Lifeless...Even Daves Drumming pretty much sucks here. It kinda sounds like they pieced something together for one last time..and hopefully, I really want them to hang it up. They have done so much and made some of the best Metal Music ever. This is pretty much an disaster. There are a few good tracks here. \\"Pyschopathy Red, Not of this God, and Public Display of Dismemberment, & Snuff are listenable, and  Playing with Dolls I'll give props to for being fairly dark and creepy, but the rest sucks. I mean its horrible. So that 4 songs out of 11 that are good, and 1 that is fair..Out of 11 tracks. 4 Good ones??? I am surpised myself, and really surpised so many liked the album, espcially fans of old....I tried to get into it more..But the band just seems to have hit a dead spot..Sure its Slayer, but its like Slayer running on 87Reg, instead of the usual 101 Octane.

B0001Z37HM|1.0|You know your movie is completely doomed when two things happen:<br /><br />1. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Brigitte Nielson are the central actors.<br />2. Schwarzenegger jokes about threatening his children with \\"Red Sonja\\" if they misbehave.<br /><br />So you have a pretty good idea what is ahead of you in sword-and-sorcery/barbarian fantasy \\"Red Sonja,\\" which manages to be cheesy and wooden at the same time. The biggest problem is Nielson's performance (which is so bad that it makes Schwarzenegger look like Laurence Olivier!), but there are plenty of goofy things to mock here.<br /><br />Sonja (Nielson) has been raped and her family has been murdered by the evil Queen Gedrin (Sandahl Bergman). A magical spirit appears and promises to help her find vengeance, tells her about all the stuff that JUST HAPPENED to her, and then vanishes. Don't worry, the spirit never appears again.<br /><br />Awhile later, Queen Gedrin invades a temple and steals a Talisman that could destroy the entire world. One of the priestesses -- who happens to be Sonja's sister -- is mortally wounded, but is rescued by Conan the Barbarian... er, sorry, his name is Kalidor (Schwarzenegger). Kalidor goes to fetch Sonja, and the priestess gets Sonja to promise to destroy the One Ring... uh, I mean the Talisman.<br /><br />So while Gedrin prepares to use the Evil Talisman of Evil, Sonja sets out on a quest to find it and get revenge... and ends up bringing along a bratty little prince, his retainer, and Kalidor. But there are many perils along the way and... stuff like that.<br /><br />I honestly wish that \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\" were still being made, because \\"Red Sonja\\" is a perfect candidate -- you've got silly barbarian costumes, plot holes (the wizard just stands there while Sonja runs over to kill him), bad special effects, and a simplistic storyline studded with stuff that just doesn't do anything but fill up time.<br /><br />But what's the worst part of this thoroughly ghastly movie? That would be Brigitte Nielson. She's very pretty, but it's hilarious watching her try to act (just watch the scene where her sister dies!). Her dense accent mutilates her lines (\\"You're A MAN!\\"... no, wait, she said \\"You're mad!\\"), and the blinkered expression on her face implies that she has no idea what's going on.<br /><br />Compared to her, Schwarzenegger seems like a master thespian -- he doesn't seem nearly as painfully uncomfortable with playing a Conan knockoff. Bergman chews the scenery until she chokes on it, and that creepy little dude from \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" plays a... creepy little dude. As for Prince Tarn, the less said about that kid the better.<br /><br />When one of the lead actors jokes about torturing people with this movie, you know it's gotta be bad. But if you do decide to watch it, ply yourself with tequila so the goofiness will be more fun.ilarious watching her try to act (just watch the scene where her sister dies!).

B00081912E|4.0|Two parts 50's film noir, three parts Hanna Barbera Cartoon, one part Farrelly Brothers homage and a sprinkle of cleavage and you have `The Mask'; a film that consistently borders on funny and absurd.  The film follows the usual antics of Jim Carrey in the usual fashion.  He plays a nerd of sorts who unleashes his bent up frustrations when an ancient mask possessing the banished soul of Loki attaches itself to his face.  Think `Me, Myself and Irene' only funny (that movie was atrocious).  The gags in `The Mask' hit you with ferocious speed, and they land more times than not, but it must be noted that the overall humor of the film tends to grow stale after a while.  It just is so `in your face' that you can't catch your breath long enough to appreciate the `funny'.  Jim Carrey is a very funny man, but I've always appreciated him more restrained roles (you'd never guess from his outlandish persona that he could pull off something as sincere and honest and Joel Barish).  Here he is abrasive and grotesque in his humor, and it works for the most part.  That said; it can grow rather monotonous after a while.  Cameron Diaz made her big screen debut here, and what a debut.  She is all sorts of OMG here, and her potential is truly seen.  Thank god she capitalized on that but delivering a barrage of marvelous performances over the past decade and a half.  In the end, this film works to an extent, but it doesn't seem to hold onto its freshness for long enough to create something truly outstanding.  The visuals are nice, and the overall texture of the film is something intriguing, but Carrey's antics only go so far here.  Still, for a rollicking good time, `The Mask' serves up B-grade entertainment for sure.

I still bought the sets, knowing that eventually OF COURSE there would be a trilogy set released with collactables and special features like always.  BUT, to hold back the digital copy, which is almost a given with most blu-rays nowadays, for the special boxset, is just mean.  Ugh.  500 stars for the movies, 1 for their strategies.

B001EYU1VO|2.0|Lets see.. I'm not going to sugar coat the good over the bad first, so i'm just going to say it. The Cyborg X is just what the above title says. In the short term, this flight stick is excellent for the average flight sim enthusiast. Long term wise, the flight stick has become unresponsive and the Z axis is now zero'd all the way right. You heard me. I can point and touch the stick without moving it and it automatically yaws to the right. I tried everything to zero out the yaw but all were fails. When I opened the bottom to check on the wiring, I found the z axis wiring and sensor and found that everything was solder on and glued over it and nothing was snagged and/or loose. As I moved said wires, the band started to fluctuate with every touch of the wires. Easy fix? probably....If thats indeed the problem. It could whatever is sensing yaw movement, but that's not the point. The point is that I had this for a little over 8 months and now broken. Yeah, I love to taxi in circles and I love when it randomly kicks in mid flight when I strafe a target on FC2. The other point i'm trying to make (and this should apply more to the average customer) is that you shouldn't go through what I am currently going through. The product should work without you (the average user)having to open it up and troubleshoot it. I'm not alone on this issue either as others seem to completely lose the Z axis or buttons become inoperable. This would be the main reason why I recommend either the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro, or the Saitek AV8R. Don't let the simplicity of that one fool you. It is perfect for the average user and all the way to below a flight sim power user with the dual throttle support. I can't speak for the hardcore folk on what I recommend since I never had one of those fancy flight control suites.     Now this ain't ALL bad. The throttles were nice, the buttons were plentiful and I like the idea that you could adjust the size of the flight stick and adjust the angles of the stickand head as well as even the Hat switch. When it did work, it worked like a charm. Responsive when I needed it to be but I was able to produce precise adjustments although the playing field of the z axis twist was a little wide but it wasn't a problem.     so to conclude, You are buying what appears to be a great flight stick but based on my report and based on what others have typed about it on here and more flight sim oriented sites, the chances of you buying a lemon over a gem are considerably high. Get the already proven winners instead. I personally recommend the AV8R if you're flying a sim that lets you have control of multiple engines but if that doesn't weigh in for you, I recommend the Extreme 3D Pro. Power users, you have your choices...I'm not sure if I want to invest in Saitek's X-65 or just wait for the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog. heck, I might just go back to the Extreme 3D Pro and wait for the verdict for the Warthog before buying (or not).
B0044LM2HU|5.0|A brief but simple review. Their first album since 1996 and the first with Paul Humphreys since 1987 does not fail to impress. Anyone who enjoys the music of OMD will LOVE this record. Be sure to download the Deluxe edition as it contains 2 extra tracks, one of which is only available on vinyl, as well as the promo video for If You Want It and the EPK. GREAT value here!
B003PIUC02|4.0|This series is obviously not meant to be a \\"serious\\" drama at all. No one should ever confuse it with HBO's ROME. It's a visceral, over the top journey of action, sex, and violence. All the things most of us love to watch, but won't admit.     That said, the writers did a surprisingly great job of weaving a fairly compelling story arc that sucks in you in the more you watch it. After a few episodes, you'll find yourself more interested in the continuing storyline itself than the gratuitous sex and violence, which comes off as a bit \\"forced\\" after a while. Each episode is just under an hour or so in length, but it seems to go much faster than that. Yet another testament to the good writing involved here.     Best description I can make is that it's an adult comic book, made solely to entertain. Don't expect to be educated or be introduced to any new thought provoking ideas. Just sit back with a beer and enjoy it.     John Hannah as Lentulus Batiatus was a hoot to watch as well.  Good to hear that he's coming back for the prequel.
B000FC1IZY|2.0|I usually save two stars for books that I feel have isses with the plot or weak characters, etc. I don't feel that this book had any issues except I found most of it completely boring. It made me want to beat my forhead against things and rock back and forth like Rain Man in an attempt to pay attention to the story. Guess too fancy and historical for my ADHD brain.<br /><br />I picked this book in honor of Banned Book Week so I felt guilty to not finish it, like if I stop somewhere some evil people will start squishing little mewlling kittens and mail me their little furry bodies in a box with a letter saying, \\"IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT...YOU COULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS BUT NOOOOOO.\\"<br /><br />I didn't give up on LCL, it kind of read like waves in the ocean. It started off dull, and then it got interesting for a while, then down and back goes the wave of interest. I can understand the reasoning for banning it, all those challenging thoughts on pretty much everything including the certainty and necessity of the Iron Age...but there is a gianormous amount of whininess that is barely tolerable.<br /><br />It's very comical to read the description of the sex scenes. First there was the lover that got mad at her for that he had to wait and hold still after he came so she could get off, like it was all her fault. Then her grounds keeper lover's sexual attraction to her was said as \\"his bowels stirred for her\\" and his cumming described as an \\"evacuating crisis\\"...which kind of sounds like the guy had explosive diarrhea, not sex. Yeah, that's sexy, lol.

044654759X|4.0|It pains me to write this review as Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author and it's usually so hard for me to find anything negative to say about his books, but SAFE HAVEN just didn't strike a chord with me.      Sure, there are some twists and turns and surprises along the way, but the story is extremely predictable.  It starts off pretty much like any Sparks novel - girl meets boy, they have to overcome some obstacles before they admit their true feelings for one another, they seem to be on the road to a happily after but the obstacle comes back to haunt them before they can move forward.      I'm not a big fan of suspense stories and this story has a bit of suspense.  Not as much as I thought there might be - I originally skimmed over the part I thought I'd find most troubling, but when I realized it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, I went back and re-read it word for word.  The ending, however, took me way by surprised and not in a good way.  I absolutely HATED the ending of this book.    You don't get a typical Nicholas Sparks ending.  I don't want to give too much away, but I turned the page expecting at least an Epilogue, but there was nothing.  I just didn't like it at all (not to mention, a little too over the top for Nicholas Sparks - one of the things I like so much about his books is the realism I get from the characters and their relationships, but I didn't get that with this one.  It went too far beyond the imagination for me)    I also thought character development was seriously lacking with SAFE HAVEN.  What drove Kevin to do the things he did?  The story was very one-sided (and I understand the reason why, but I think a little more history or back-story was needed to explain how and why he was the way that he was).  There were almost no supporting characters in this story.  Yes, there was Joy, but due to the ending, I feel that character was ruined.  Names in passing were mentioned, and referred to every once in a while, but there was no interaction with the main characters.  No sounding board, no voices outside of Alex and Katie.      I did enjoy the courtship and Katie's maturity as a mother figure for Joshua and Kristen.  The kids were cute and their feelings and actions felt real.  Alex's concern for them and how the family came as a package and it wasn't just the two of them, was well told.  I was looking forward to this big payoff at the end, but it just never came.    Overall, the book was good, but for me, the ending pretty much ruined it and I found myself seriously let down when I turned the last page and closed the book for the last time.  Usually, I want to open it up and read it all over again, but this time I had no desire to do that - unless another ending was waiting for me the second time around.

054531058X|5.0|The Hunger Games has so many levels it's hard to know where to begin.  The first level of course, is the exciting life and death story of Katniss, a girl a future where reality t.v. is not about 'getting the millionaire to pick you' but about staying alive.  It's easy to see that if our government clamped down on us enough to cause an uprising, that it would use a form of entertainment to keep us in line.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has written a brilliant book will last through generations in the same why that Fahrenheit 451 has done for the previous generation.  The Hunger Games show just how important ideas can come to life in a powerful way.  If I were a teacher, my class would be reading this book no matter what grade I taught.  That Collins could put her ideas into such an exciting plot shows how good she really is.<br /><br />The characters are not cardboard cutouts.  They have strengths and weaknesses, along with the trials of just being a teenager. With the United States divided into 13 sections, there are varying degrees of hardship for the characters, yet they find a reason to live through their love of family and each other.<br /><br />I'm already starting book 2 of the series where the story of Katniss and the two boys she loves continues.  I highly recommend this exciting book and can practically guarantee your young reader will love it.  Great for either a boy or girl.
B000HKM9VG|5.0|I had seen this book as a movie quite a long time ago; however, the book truly outshines the movie, as is generally the case. Grisham brings his characters to life and you feel involved and invested in their lives and the story. It is, once again, a truly well-written novel; and, I now have read 13 of Grisham's novels; with, the intention of ordering more. I am \\"comfortable\\" with legal thrillers; as, I've had the opportunity to testify as an Expert Witness; and, I find Grisham's work to be non-sensationalistic and quite realistic. For example, A Time To Kill had an ending to it that I could not predict; and, that's what keeps me going back for more of Grisham's works!
0553805371|5.0|I have a deep interest in Cosmology and have always been interested in Stephen Hawking's ideas about black holes and other cosmological topics.  I must say this book really captivated me. I was very happy with a lot of the quantum theory explanations since this is an area that has always been unclear to me (as it probably is for most people).  The ideas and explanations of other possible dimensions and universes is such a mind blowing and imaginative subject.  Whether or not the theories in this book turn out to be true or false its refreshing to read subject matter that goes so far beyond the ordinary.  Say what you want about Stephen Hawking but the man is brilliant and has done a lot for cosmology not only in coming up with ground breaking theories but also for bringing these complicated ideas and theories to a level that us mere mortals can comprehend.
0525951652|4.0|Confession: the size looks daunting even for a self-proclaimed bookish type like me. Almost 1,000 pages - a historical novel to end all historical novels. War and Peace look out. It's not as if I didn't know any better; I have seen Pillars of the Earth, although I've never read it. This is my first foray into the world of Follett and I am so glad to say that I found Fall of Giants by Ken Follett to be very entertaining and educational.     Fall of Giants depicts five families from 1910 to 1918, during which not only the first World War exploded, but the Russian Revolution erupted. The time period is a rich one to examine, not only because of those events, but also because the lines between the classes, the haves and the have nots were rapidly dissolving. As the title implies, Fall of Giants chronicles the decline of power of royalty, aristocrats, and the Old World as commoners, peasants, and the New World gain ascendance.     The Earl of Fitzherbert's family consists of his spoiled and cruel but beautiful wife, a Russian princess and his sister, Lady Maud, a rebel suffragette.     Within the earl's household is Ethel Williams, an ambitious Welsh housemaid trying to better herself. Her brother, Billy, is a coal miner drafted for the war.     Lady Maud is romantically involved with Walter von Ullrich, a German diplomat also of nobility. Their relationship becomes dangerous once their two countries enter the war on opposite sides.     Grigori is a Russian factory worker whose family has been mistreated by Russian nobility. He is torn between his allegiance to his country during the war and fighting for the revolution to overthrow the tsar.     Gus Dewar, as part of President Woodrow Wilson's staff, is doing everything he can to keep America from entering the war.     Follett is adept at moving the interrelated stories along so that the plot never felt plodding at all. Political upheaval, technological advancement, women's rights make for exciting times as seen throughthe eyes of the ordinary folk. However, the characters seemed more symbolic of the times: the imperious nobleman, the hardworking commoner, the earnest young American. Fall of Giants thoroughly immersed me in the attitudes and perspectives of the era: the dangerous life of a coalminer, how it felt to be a Russian peasant at the mercy of the aristocrats' whims, what it was like to be a soldier on both sides of a battle.    The complex political maneuvers and alliances that brought on the first World War were particularly fascinating and illuminated what will probably be explored in the 2nd book in the trilogy, the Third Reich. With the rest of the century to go, I am quite curious to see which events Follett will focus on: World War II, the Cold War, Iraqi War???    Fall of Giants is a breathtaking doorstopper of an epic perfect for lovers of historical novels.
0385339682|4.0|Other than his short story collection \\"Ford County,\\" this is the only decent book Grisham has written since \\"The Rainmaker,\\" and even this one, much as I love it, had an ending that made me find somewhere private and cry.  Maybe it wasn't such a good move to read it shortly after my mom died, and maybe I should have thought twice because of Grisham's taste for bitterly unhappy endings.  It could have easily ended in the courthouse, rather than where it did. Up to then, it was a true page-turner, as impossible to put down as any book I can name.  Nothing since by him has come close.
030726999X|5.0|All three of Larsson's books live up to their reputation.  They kept me on the edge of my chair, so much so that when I finished Hornet's Nest, the 3rd book, I started reading the first one (Dragon Tattoo) again.<br /><br />Larsson's plot moves briskly and his characters are credible.  The translator deserves praise also since the dialogue uses idioms that are quite consistent with the characters.<br /><br />I had trouble keeping the Swedish names straight, but to do so was worth the effort.  I heartily recommend the books, but be sure you have plenty of time and not a lot of other pressing commitments.
B0038QMREA|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever had the pleasure of hearing.  With that said, he's not for everyone (as my friends and family like to continuously remind me) - but with a brief concentration on his story, you may begin to see how his voice ties with the poetics of his lyrics, so perfectly.  I wouldn't have it any other way!  He sings about friendship, lost love, longing love, angry love, hopeful love, and a whole lot of subjects that can hit close to home.  It's an album full of metaphors, some of which I still trouble myself over deciphering, but that is part of the enjoyment.  A new story unfolds each time I listen to a song.. a new interpretation, or a more emphasized meaning.  I love his raw, slightly high-pitched, raspy voice, and I look forward to all of his future releases - he will not disappoint, I'm certain.  He's too full of emotion to lose touch of the music he creates.  One man, a guitar..  that's all you really need to feel the warm fuzzies.

0142000671|5.0|After reading this book, I couldn't stop thinking about Lennie and George.    It's highly emotionally impacting, and that is due to Steinbeck's outstanding story-telling..   excellent character development in a startlingly short amount of time..  so you're not only invested in the story itself, but with each character - strongly so the supporting cast.  It was so simple to paint a vivid image in my mind.    A story about the true testament of friendship, but not in the conventional way.  A story about choices, consequences, lessons, control.. and how often times, the spirit is who it is..  and controlling it or a destiny, will never be fulfilled.
B00005JSGK|5.0|With the cast doing up close and personal stunts with African animals, including in the capture sequences, there was more actual danger in this film than most!<br /><br />In Hatari!, John Wayne leads a group of professional animal capture experts, filling orders for zoos worldwide. Their season of hunting is complicated when one of the group is gored by a rhino, and by a female photographer (Dallas) who shows up. When Dallas begins to accumulate a nursery of baby elephants, things get even more complicated.<br /><br />A budding romance between Sean (Wayne) and Dallas is by no means overdone, but does provide a few of the many amusing moments in this excellent tale, full of slice of life moments on the African veldt and in the hunters' compound. Such solid acting talent as Red Buttons, Bruce Cabot, and Hardy Kruger help fill a delightful cast which operates with perfect chemistry.<br /><br />Listen closely as the cast prods and pushes a zebra into a capture crate. You'll hear John Wayne say \\"Get him the hell in there!\\" While common even in family hour programming for decades now, you didn't hear even \\"hell\\" and \\"damn\\" in much movie dialog in 1962! LOL<br /><br />Another treat is the rocket shot to capture monkeys.<br /><br />This is a one of a kind movie. If somehow you haven't seen it yet, make sure you do. You won't be disappointed.

B003UYUQZW|2.0|I recently watched this movie on the plane, was surprised that I thought it sucked even as a plane movie, decided I was going to write a review panning it, and then completely forgot I had watched it the moment I landed.  I kept on racking my brain, trying to think of the movie I had watched on the plane, quite amazed that two hours of my life had just disappeared like that.  I kept on pushing myself to remember, and I couldn't do it.  It was only when I was randomly trolling the Amazon pages did I see the \\"Prince of Persia\\" DVD, and remembered that I had watched it on the plane.      Anyway, that's all I really wanted to say.  Oh, and the movie sucked.  And one last thing:  I watched it because Jake Gyllenhaal was in it, and I thought that a man so talented (he really was good in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and \\"Jarhead\\") could compensate for just about anything.  But I was wrong.  (Okay, I lied -- I only watched it because I was on a 13-hour flight.)

B00127RAJY|5.0|I've done the 30-Day Shred several times and while I never really lost any weight (it was the only workout I did during that time period), I DID feel stronger and slept better at night (I deal with insomnia).<br /><br />I love the three different levels and the variety Jillian brings to each level. They do get progressively more difficult but (thank GOD!) Jillian always has a beginner's model for each level who modifies some of the basic moves to make them easier. On the other hand if you want a challenge, Jillian has an advanced model who can help you to step things up if the basic move is too easy. There is something for all workout types here!<br /><br />While I think this DVD is fantastic, I will say that it's rather hard on the knees and I would NOT recommend this routine consistently for those who have knee problems. (If you have mild knee problems, supplement this DVD with another workout that focuses on the upper body such as [[ASIN:B001NFNFN0 Jillian Michaels: Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism]] or [[ASIN:B000A3DGG2 10 Minute Solution - Kickbox Bootcamp]]. If you have severe knee problems, do the upper body moves and skip the lower body exercises that put emphasis on bending or kneeling.) I'm rather young (under 30), not very athletic or fit, and my knees don't normally bother me except after I've done this workout for 2 weeks straight. If you don't have any knee problems at all, feel free to tackle this workout with everything you've got!<br /><br />Note: GUYS will be challenged by this DVD as well.<br /><br />My only other warning for this DVD would be that it's mostly for relatively fit/slightly overweight (up to 30 lbs over ideal body weight) people. If you fall into the extremely overweight/obese category (50+ lbs over ideal body weight), many of these moves could be difficult (even at Level 1!) and I'd recommend one of The Biggest Loser videos such as [[ASIN:B000WEVGHA The Biggest Loser Workout: Cardio Max]] or [[ASIN:B000WEVGHK The Biggest Loser Workout: Power Sculpt]] instead. And don't think I'm cheating you out of a tough workout by recommending a Biggest Loser DVD--I couldn't finish [[ASIN:B000WEVGHA The Biggest Loser Workout: Cardio Max]] the first time I did it.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoy Jillian's no-nonsense attitude and her honesty (\\"This doesn't come for free!\\" \\"You have to fight for it and work for it!\\") during the workouts. She doesn't sugarcoat how difficult exercise is and encourages you to come back day after day to sculpt the body you want.

0545265355|5.0|I was very excited to see that there is a box set for the Hunger Games trilogy because I didn't own any of them prior to the release of Mockingjay (the third installment). I got this box set, reread the first two books in the series, seeing as it had been over a year since I'd read Catching Fire (the second installment), and the read Mockingjay right after that.     The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay are really wonderful books - they're captivating and extremely difficult to put down (each time I read them, it took me under 24 hours to read each book). The box set is a nice way to have all three hardcover copies for a good price, and it looks nice on a bookshelf!

The entire planet loses conscienceness for 2 minutes and 17 seconds, and the whole world sees the future during those 137 seconds. If you like twisting plots and mind boggling possibilities, this is your show! Each episode takes you further into the maze, and just when you think you're starting to figure it out, you get hit with a turn you don't see coming. And then you start to wonder: Where would I be if it really happened? Would I survive? And if I did, most importantly, what would I see?   The only downside: There is no more...However, STILL worth the watch, every fa-ci-na-ting moment!  -pj
030726999X|1.0|I loved the first two books but can only make it a few pages at a time in the third.  In case you're 1/3 of the way into the book and wondering if you should bother finishing it, I suggest you put it down and walk away.  That's what I'm going to do.
0312600844|5.0|So glad I took the time to read this book!  I bought it before Oprah  chose it as her bookclub pick, so glad she did.  Franzen writes about real people and he's so clever in his approach,  in that he makes the reader hate these annoying people but in the end  all is well, and you sort of miss them!  I read this in 3 days, so it  left me wanting to read more each time I put the book down.  The book has some interesting current event themes and of course, Freedom  and on so many different levels.  I don't get the negative reviews other than to tell people to ignore them!  Most of them are due to the reviewer NOT having read the book or just not  getting it!  This book is fantastic because it talks about issues we deal  with in our lives right now.  Great read!!! Don't miss it.  I read alot and  every once in awhile I find a book that is so worthy of my time, this was one of them.  Read it on my kindle, worth the price, wish it were 9.99 though!
B000Y9Q59W|5.0|Stunning and realistic performances by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen. It's the kind of film that makes you want to see the young kid win.  However, he finds out what really goes on in the big world of high finance and the end is outstanding.  It will keep you watching to see what happens next.....definately not a dull movie, and not the kind of \\"world\\" I would want to be intmately involved in.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I use this as an external recorder for sound when filming. When hooked up to a lav mic and utilizing the built-in speakers and 4-ch audio function you can get amazing sound with plenty of extra tracks if needed. For the price this thing can't be beat. The only downside is that it does seem a little flimsy, but if treated properly I don't see there being any problems at all. The interface takes a few minutes to get used to but once you figure it out navigating the menus is a breeze. Highly recommended for any lower budget audio recording.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|This movie will forever be one of my favorites. We watch it often enough that we know the song lyrics and can quote our favorite characters (the worm in the wall, Bluto...)<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly is great, and David Bowie is quite memorable.
1439170045|5.0|This was the second time that I read Still Alice and it was as riveting as the first time.Knowing very little about early onset of Alzheimer's disease, this story is<br />not only informative but tells the tale from the patient's point of view. The author is extremely knowledgeable in neuroscience. She also has the capacity to<br />make all of these characters real. I feel as if I have known Alice and her family. It is as if Alice is sharing her experience and her thoughts with you as<br />a close friend might also do during this debilitating disease. Don't miss the opportunity to read this book.I am looking forward to Genova's next novel<br />titled Left Neglected.
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|*May contain spoilers*<br /><br />Because everything else that sounded interesting was in 3D (which makes me ill) we decided to give Devil a try.  Written by M. Night Shyamalan and directed by John Dowdle, this horror/suspense movie was merely average.<br /><br />We start out by listening to the narrator tell us a story his mom used to tell him.  The basic gist of it is that when a person commits suicide, it opens a gate for the devil to get through.  The devil will then have a grand old time killing people trapped in a confined space while spectators watch powerless to stop it.  Then, we immediately see someone commit suicide.<br /><br />At this point you know what's going to happen and silently cringe when you see five people enter an elevator in the same building the person committed suicide. These people are a temp guard (Bokeem Woodbine, a young woman (Bojana Novakovic), a mechanic (Logan Marshall-Green, an older woman (Jenny O'Hara), and an annoying slimy salesman (Geoffrey Arend).  Everything seems normal until their elevator stumbles to a halt.  The lights start acting up, music starts playing for no good reason, and every time it turns dark, someone dies.  They all think the worst of each other, never really knowing what is happening to them.  Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) and Ramirez our narrator (Jacob Vargas) was on as they try to rescue these people from their plight.<br /><br />For a horror movie, I was thankful that they kept the gore to a minimum.  The killings were also very low key due to the dark that kept happening in the elevator as well.  This was a little better for the more squeamish who might decide to watch this movie.  It centered more around plot in this case, which is some ways was good and some ways was bad.  Certainly it was better to have a story rather than a random killing spree, but in actuality, the story was somewhat boring.  Having been told what was going to happen originally by the narrator, you were just watching events play out instead of trying to guess what would happen next.<br /><br />There was some music in this movie.  However, being that it was in an elevator, it was elevator music, and only one song played sporadically through most of the movie.  There might have been some other music during other scenes, but i don't recall it so if there was it wasn't noticeable.<br /><br />The actors were decent.  Jenny O'Hara is kind of always an odd ball character to me and she didn't surprise me by venturing out of that role for this film.  The rest of the actors were new to me so I didn't have a standing opinion of any of them.  Now after the movie was over, I still don't.  They did well enough, it was just going back to the fact that the plot was somewhat slow that I think they didn't have a great opportunity to really dazzle us with their acting.<br /><br />I probably won't go rushing out to buy this movie.  I might not even volunteer to see it again.  It wasn't terrible, but really just wasn't good enough to spend another couple hours watching again.<br /><br />Review by M.

B002L5GQGY|5.0|I'm not a musician, so I'll leave the nuances to those that portend to know about phrasing, etc. I was blown away hearing him for the first time. My wife changed the channel to a PBS station that was having one of their fund drives and this concert starts booming out of my ARs in the den. I dropped the chicken salad and ran to see what I was hearing. Needless to say I'm a fan now and may not be as educated as some musically, but I know what I like and this is definitely going to be played on a regular basis.     Two thoughts though. After seeing one of his guitar riffs, I thought he might be an alien planted here by a higher intelligence. Just too smooth, too effortless. Then it dawned on me. He looks like Agent Smith from the Matrix. Which explains the insane, almost unnatural ability. That's it. He's a computer generated hologram planted here by an alien society bent on driving the rest of us mere mortal musicians insane. That's the ticket!

0452295548|5.0|This book is very enlightening about the possibilities for recovery of a serious stroke victim.  The extent of recovery can be much more with the right therapy, frame of mind, strength of character and patience.  A very good read and I think a must read for most people to understand the potential of a stroke victim or at least the possibilities of a more complete recovery if hope isn't given up.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Heath Ledger had a way of making every part he played unique and interesting.  Great teen fare with just the right mix of Seattle music and teen anxst.  The school used as the set was a great location find.  Lots of young actors in this film that went on to bigger things.
0316067938|5.0|I have read all four of the main Twilight Books and loved them all.  I saw some negative reviews for Breaking Dawn and was nervous to read it cause I didn't want to be let down since I loved the other three so much.  Well, so glad I didn't listen to that and read it anyway.  I loved it!  What a great story!
0525951652|3.0|Follett is my favorite author.  Fall of Giants definitely engaged me.  As usual his characters are interesting because they are not black & white.  All the characters are flawed and make mistakes, even the heroes.  And there are no \\"villains\\" (as major characters), just highly flawed people that he allows us into the heads of just as easily as he does the protagonists so that you almost sympathize with them.  At its core this book (as the title alludes to, referring both to nations and classes) is really about the shift in social classes.  In this first entry, the gulf starts out so staggeringly large - the rich, noble class really has no idea that it isn't right and proper for them to rule over everyone as their betters and use them like pawns on a chessboard.    The history is interesting.  I certainly knew all the major events but gained some better perspective on the mindset of people at the time and how much classism played into it, not just in Russia but for the Allies as well.    The negatives are it really is covering too much ground.  I love epics.  But it is frustrating how often once the story had focused on one character or group for a while you suddenly jumped to another set and by the time you returned major events had transpired.  This kind of jumping around is common in in books by Michener and his many copycats, but usually that jumping around is between time periods (or generations) and not back and forth over such a small period of years with the same characters.  The result is that, ironically despite almost 1,000 pages, it lacks true depth.    I was fortunate enough to get an advance copy of the hardcover for free.  Normally I would buy the e-book. However, having read it now I would not recommend anyone pay the premium of the e-book price which Penguin believes is worth MORE than the hardcover despite less cost to produce and distribute.  Whatever their motive, it is a ridiculous and cynical act and while I love Follett I suggest there's nothing here that can't wait for the price to be lowered to something respectable.  And for those who say this is unfair to the author, please note that Mr. Follett has, by his own admission, sold over 100 million books.  He is one of if not the most important author in Penguin's catalog.  The idea that he doesn't have the ability to influence them if he so chose is silly.  And since Amazon offers publishers the choice to receive the exact same compensation for e-book sales as for hardcover if Amazon sets the price lower, it also is untrue to conclude that Mr. Follett would lose a penny if the e-book price was not set higher than the hardcover.  The facts support only one conclusion - they are trying to make more profit from e-sales than print sales, despite a lower cost.  For some of you it may be worth it.  My recommendation, having read the book, is it can wait.    I give the content 4 stars and the e-book price 0 stars, but I am assigning more overall weight to the content for a combined rating of 3 stars.
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|For fans, this release has been a long time coming.  A truncated version of the live Nassau Coliseum show has been available as a bootleg for some 30-odd years.  Two of the tracks received an official release in 1992 as part of Rykodisc's Bowie reissue campaign, but finally we have it in its full blown state-of-the-art 2010 remastered glory (and sounding pretty damned good for a 34 year-old recording)!<br />The packaging is outstanding and the liner notes are generous.<br />One minor peeve: I had read that there would be a download link to obtain the full 13:08 minute version of Panic in Detroit with the extended drum solo, but so far, I have not been able to locate that. In reality, I can probably live without it...

How could anyone, mothers especially, who read this book not want to emulate this character?  Donoghue has given us a classic for our time.  Beautifully written.  Oh to be able to write like that!

B002ZG98Z0|4.0|If you haven't already seen Sex and the City 2, the movie offers more than just fun, laughs, and woman-power--it provokes thought on an important medical issue.    In one of the wild storylines, Samantha Jones (played by Kim Cattrall) is going through menopause and using bio- identical hormones as her treatment: estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. Most women don't even know this natural hormone alternative exists since the last word from their doctor (and the news) was that synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT) significantly increases one's risk of heart disease and breast cancer.     What is more, any breast cancer survivor in the audience who remembers Samantha's history would consider her treatment as downright bad medicine.  But, is it?  Is Hollywood so irresponsible?  Should one take medical advice from a movie anyway?     Bio-identical hormones are completely different molecules from synthetic hormones. What is more, they are actually more effective and safer than synthetic hormones for the treatment of menopause.  In fact, Hollywood's decision to raise awareness about bio-identical hormones in Sex and the City 2 is cutting-edge in comparison to Broadway's choice to promote antidepressants and \\"welcome and celebrate\\" menopause in Menopause The Musical.    Sex and the City 2 offers new information about menopause therapy for women to think about and discuss with their doctor.     Shira Miller, M.D.   [...]
0375851569|5.0|I love Dr. Seuss's books! When I was 32 yrs. old I gave birth to my only child/son.  During his infant years and through 5-6 years old, I read him all of Dr. Suess's books and fairy tale books over and over. Through constant repetition of his favorite books, he was able to recite and read out loud an entire book by himself and also knowing when to exactly turn the page of a book. I credit Dr. Seuss for making my son's early years a wonderful and fun reading/listening experience of \\"magical\\" books filled with excitement, adventure and laughter. He is now 27 years old, married and is expecting his first child soon. He still remembers and can recite \\"One fish, Two Fish\\". He claims Dr. Suess's books is one of the best educational tools you can give to a child to learn how to read and still make it fun for them.  I bought this beginner book collection, so his child can also enjoy the wonderful world of Dr. Seuss!
B003YBNREI|5.0|On WORLD GONE CRAZY, the Doobie Brothers have reunited with producer Ted Templeman, and the result is their best studio album since the 1975 classic STAMPEDE. The CD features guest appearances by country legend Willie Nelson and sometime member Michael McDonald, and includes the single \\"Nobody\\", which is a remake of a song from their self-titled 1970 debut album. This album is the one that fans of the early Doobies have been waiting for since 1975.

B003EY7IUY|4.0|I have been a Sophie Kinsella fan for many years.  After \\"Twenties Girl\\" I was a little worried about this book.  I seriously disliked Twenties Girl, and I was a little worried about her stories going down hill.  I was pleasantly surprised by Mini Shopaholic.  I agree with many of the other readers that it is not quite as good as the first three books, but I think it was still a very high quality book.  I've read some of the reviews on here where people were saying Becky's character was getting to be too far fetched, but I think this is right on par with Becky that we know and love.  She does seem slightly selfish for a mother, but all mothers aren't perfect, and I think she does want the best for Minnie.  I would recommend this book to a friend, and to all Shopaholic Readers.  I'm very excited to see what lays in store for the next book.  I was slightly worried that there may not be another one, but I believe with this ending, that we will see more Becky.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|One of the more highly-regarded superhero movies, I feel \\"Iron Man\\" deserves the acclaim. It has some excellent action sequences, but also balances them with a fair amount of drama. The dialogue is witty throughout and the story has a positive message. Each cast member delivers a superb performance, led by the reinvigorated Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.    Taking over his father's company, Tony Stark is responsible for developing and selling modern weaponry to the United States government. While in Afghanistan to show off a new missile system, he is kidnapped by terrorists who want him to create the weapon for them. Instead, Tony creates his first Iron Man outfit. Seeing how the terrorists had been using some weapons created by his company to murder innocents, Tony has a change of heart over selling weaponry and wants the company to cease weapons selling. This doesn't sit well with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who takes care of the company's daily operations and ultimately opposes the change. Tony still goes one step further and develops a more advanced Iron Man outfit to go up against the terrorists.    As for his personal life, Tony Stark is a playboy whose only real constant is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his personal assistant. It soon becomes clear just how much they care for each other. His only other real ally is Lt. Col. Rhodes (Terrence Howard), who helps bail Tony out. The scenes with Pepper and Rhodes include many of the better moments, both dramatic and humorous.    This movie works well because the action is well-done without completely overshadowing the drama and humor. The excellent writing, acting, and effects make it an enjoyable movie which loses little to nothing in repeat viewings.
0393072231|5.0|I have nothing much to add to the other 5-star reviews of The Big Short.   The book is well-written, entertaining and informative.  But I do have to ask, how is it that betting on whether a bond owned by someone else will pay off is legal outside of Nevada?   Or, if one wishes to characterize it as insurance, why isn't it regulated by the state insurance regulators?  And, for all of Burry's, Lippman's and Eisner's prescience, didn't they take a big risk (Burry in particular) by not knowing if the insuring entity would be able to pay out once the housing market crashed?  This becomes an issue later in the book, but isn't it something they should have thought about beforehand? They were lucky--the government bailed out AIG and others.  The loser, it seems, were the taxpayers.
0439023483|4.0|This book was recommended to me. After reading several reviews decrying the authors lack of originality, I decided to give it a whirl because I'd never read or even heard of the other books with which Collins was supposed to have plagiarized herself.<br /><br />Anyone who has the sack and drive to write a book and put it out there for the world to critcize has my respect because most of us wouldn't even make the attempt.So I will not review this book based on her  alleged lack of creativity or compare it to any other work becaue quite frankly, I can't speak intelligently about similar works because like I said, I'm not generally a fan of the genre or author.<br /><br />With that said: It was a very pleasant read. Many of the character were very underdeveleloped so I didn't feel any great loss when they died. I didn't experience the same grief I did when Fred Weasley or Remus Lupin were suddenly and irrevocably ripped from my life (OK! Just one comparision to another book about resourceful kids. I won't do it again!). The Peeta character is of course, adorable, but I got a little sick of him being such a burden even though his unconditional love of Katniss makes me love him more than I can explain.<br /><br />I eventually reached a point where the \\"super heroishness\\" of the female lead became unbelievable to me. I'm a big fan of the strong-willed, ass-kicking, self-sufficient, bow-and-arrow-wielding woman, but does a strong woman always have to mean a weakened and ultimately hobbled man? Even Haymitch, who is supposed to be the mentor and secret weapon is a hopeless drunk. The only man worth a damn is Gale, who's (even though I know he returns in full force in later books) character is dampered right at the beginning. As for Cinna &lt;tear-sniff!>, you can't say a word against Cinna. He is BRILLIANT (keep reading) but with the personal stylist profession and golden eye make-up, I can't help wondering if the author purposely feminized one of the only really likeable, solid male characters to maintain the feminist vibe. Even her father, who seemed to be otherworldly in is heroism is dead before the book starts and only serves as an unseen \\"Spiritual Sensei\\" who taught her everything she knows and inspires her from beyond the grave.<br /><br />All the other men are stupid, burdensome, worthless or savage.

Even Effie is narcissistic and self centered, but she's smart, efficient and well put together.<br /><br />This was just my view of the book and by no means dampened my enjoyment of it.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|My first issue with this book is the price. It's obvious that there is an adjenda against e books from this publisher. This price is a slap at the people who buy all books. It is a poorly thought out counter productive move.     My second issue is how very bad it is. My friend passed me his review copy because I like tomes. This book isn't writing it's typing. Poor plot, no depth. I got to page 282 before I gave up.      Don't buy this book.
B0044430H8|5.0|The score is electronically based, a lot of use of drum machines and warm synths, delicately sprinkled with subtle \\"hot noise\\",guitar drones, and crunchy textures. The sound is succulent and sweet yet aggravated in a highly controlled manner of wear and tear. When listening to the music, I was getting a sense of a corruption brewing underneath all the audio seduction.  Quite unlike anything out there, in terms of scores, and another progressive step  for the creative duo. It is an important album for film-philes, as well as the general electronic music fan base as well.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|Many bands tend to put together a Greatest Hits album and in order to properly convey the band's sound they must include more than just the hits...but the strongest of the band's catalog.  A-Sides was a single disk and did include many great songs but it left off many songs that defined the band's early sound.  There weren't many songs from [[ASIN:B000000M4A Ultramega Ok]] and none from the band's EP's.  Soundgarden's Telephantasm includes all of tracks from A-Sides (just switching some of the tracks for live versions) and then some.  Included is the epic \\"Beyond the Wheel\\" , a version of \\"Flower\\" that might just have been what it would have sounded like unmarred by SST's bad production, and the original version of \\"Room a Thousand Years Wide\\".  \\"Fopp\\" is an awesome cover of an Ohio Player's song in which the band makes a 70's soul/funk song their own, and \\"Hunted Down\\" shows the band was able to write a good song even that early in the game.  There's also a DVD of extras.  Although i am dissapointed that some of the better B-sides (like \\"Into the Void (Sealth)\\" and \\"Blind Dogs\\") weren't included.  I'm hoping on a new studio album sometime in the future...
B00008GKEG|5.0|Astoundingly, at 40 years old I have only recently discovered the Beatles.  I received the USB version of the 2009 remasters collection as a birthday gift, and since then have been voraciously gathering as much data as I can about the group.<br />As part of my research, I acquired the Anthology DVD set.  I had read a few books first so by the time I started watching the videos I was somewhat familiar with the story, but had only seen a few photos.  It has been very nice to have the DVD set to bring the story more vividly to life.<br />I would totally recommend this DVD set to anyone who wants to know more about the Beatles.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again, a great read that I couldn't put down!  I read it in one day.  Great story about a woman fleeing from her abusive husband. I highly recommend this book.  If you've read books on the same subject, don't let that deter you from reading this.  It's a page turner with a great surprising ending!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this adaptation. I loved the novel as well. For the 1-star reviewers that apparently think someone is going to read their reviews and start cutting them a check, THIS IS A MOVIE! If you want the novel, read the novel.
B003PIUC02|5.0|Starz is truly a ground breaker.  Deadwood, Rome, and now Spartacus.  Graphic, 'real', dramatic, and historically accurate, the Starz team of producers and writers have outdone themselves one more time.<br /><br />Spartacus is the story of the legendary slave, set 20 years prior to Rome.  Spartacus, the slave, is captured and fights his way to leadership of his fellow slaves.  Just as Rome built a powerful drama based on politics and personal vendetta, so too is Spartacus fleshed out amidst the gladitorial games.  There is violence, sex, and everything inbetween.  The time was barbaric, and this production spares no viewer an accurate view of that time.  As a younger viewer, I remember Caligula and being offended by some of the scenes, in Spartacus and Rome, Caligula was just a foretaste.<br /><br />Apart from the graphic nature of the series, the casting of Lawless, Whitfield, Hannah, and Mensah is brilliant.  Plotwise, I am awed by the broad sweep of history that we regard as then, as opposed to now.  Sadly, we have not really changed, just changed our behaviours (in some countries and venues).  The official site at [...] is just as spectacular as the series and both compliment each other beautifully.<br /><br />The episodes included are:<br /><br />The Red Serpent<br />Sacramentum Gladitorum<br />Legends<br />The Thing in the Pit<br />Shadow Games<br />Delicate Things<br />Great and Unfortunate Things<br />Mark of the Brotherhood<br />Whore<br />Party Favors<br />Old Wounds<br />Revelation<br />Kill Them All<br /><br />My favorite....Thing the Pit!<br /><br />While there are only 13 episodes thus far, the remainder of the upcoming series and seasons will be spectacular. With any series if this is only a beginning, WOW!<br /><br />In a word, Spartacus is spectacular.<br /><br />Tim Lasiuta
0385528752|5.0|Well-written and presented with intelligence, this book delivers what it promises (for the most part) in a reader-friendly way. However, I was torn between 4 and 5 stars.    On the one hand, applying these principles within a corporate context almost certainly would work well because the book recommends a series of strategies that appropriately sidestep emotionally laden issues. In addition, the proposals may seem fresh and relatively innovative to most of us.    On the other hand, successful application to personal issues (such as addiction or poor eating habits) is less promising. In theory, these hypotheses should work very well. Nevertheless, the unconscious aspects associated with these areas are usually far more compelling (and imprisoning) than this book could possibly address.     Since deeply rooted psychological aspects fall far from this book's anticipated scope, I gave it 5 stars. Yet I wish the authors had acknowledged this complexity/limitation just once.
B002MEW7YY|4.0|I bought this because I had seen the live performance and the HD performance. It's a great performance of Lucia,,,most enjoyable.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|PC World recently had an article about Technology's Biggest Myths.  One of the most outrageous myths was \\"High-Priced HDMI Cables Make Your HDTV Look Better\\".  According to the article, the only time you might be concerned about expensive cables is if they need to cover a long distance (8 meters or more).    I bought this HDMI cable to connect my laptop PC to my HDTV and it works just fine.  I also tried it connecting my satellite receiver to the same TV and the picture quality was excellent.
0060512806|3.0|Long book.  Ending was lame, don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it...but this random dude shows up at the end for no apparent reason (at least to me).    a few parts of the book didn't seem to fit, like when randy was trying to get dental surgery.
B003XU7VM4|3.0|Fact: None of the books mentioned have any history mentioned in Amazon. With amazon's selection, that has to be pretty obscure. About the only thing my dad and I haven't found was an Italian film which inexplicably got removed from most collections. We found Song of the South, which was suppressed for awhile by Disney. But yet supposedly they were bestsellers (because the books in ABC were bestsellers). The same is true of the family.  Sure, it could be based on a real person, but don't you think we'd hear of him before the show?
B003TML0VO|4.0|This set is like his \\"Supernatural\\" and other recent sets in that each song features a different singer. The difference  here is that here, Santana covers classic rock standards. The standards  chosen are very well known  songs and some come off much better than others. Overall, a very high percentage of winners:  Best is the Beatles cover by India.Arie and \\"Riders on the Storm\\" with original Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek although the vocal is not as good as the original. The Stones cover, the Deep Purple song and the Joe Cocker and Jonny Lang pieces all succeed very well. Least effective is Nas on \\"Back in Black\\". The set might have benifitted from with some less overplayed songs but Santana gives them a fresh take, in most cases. When such a diverse guest list is put together, not all will play out as well as others. This CD also offers a chance to hear Santana playing some styles that he normally wouldn't. Overall, I'd say 3.5 to 4 stars and an enjoyable CD.
B00005QGAV|3.0|Now, I'm a pretty big Mj fan and I must admit this album wasn't all that great. Mj had three classic's back to back with: Off The Wall, Thriller, and Bad. All those albums he did with super producer Quincy Jones. On this album he decided to work with New Jack Swing producer Teddy Riley with mixed results.<br /><br />The Pros<br /><br />Mj gets back to his r&b roots on ''Remember The Time'' and gets sexy on tracks like ''In The Closet'' which makes me dance and blush at the same time. Mj never came across as a ''sexual being'' so, while Mj made the song a hit, Prince would have made it a classic. It's a great song but not for Mj. Those are probably the two most popular songs off the album but not the best to me. My favorite song on the album is ''Give In To Me''. I think Mj really should have done more rock songs. Him and Slash mash great together. I also love ''Who is it?'' which is about a cheating woman. I never heard Mj sound so grown and mature on a track. He normally didn't talk alot about sexual relationships of any kind in his music.<br /><br />Other songs I enjoy or ''She Drives Me Wild''. It's very hip-hop/r&b and even features a F-List rapper named Auil Davidson and ''Will You Be There'' which is classic ''stop the hate/come together'' Mj. It's basically the '' Man in the Mirror''/''Human Nature'' of this album.<br /><br />The Cons<br /><br />Once again I love Mj but dude can be very corny. I HATE ''Heal The World'' and ''Black or White'' with a passion. They are two of the worse songs he ever made. They come across preachy and while I see what he was trying to do (make the world better for our children/stop the hate) it's a major fail. I feel like I need crackers for all that cheese. Also he had too many fillers. I don't see how ''Why You Wanna Trip On Me?'', ''Can't Let Her Get Away'', and ''Jam'' even made the album. Those songs are forgettable. In fact the only reason why I remember ''Jam'' is because Michael Jordan and Kriss Kross were in the video.<br /><br />Other misses are ''Keep the Faith'' (another keep you head up things will get better tracks which falls short) and ''Dangerous'' the title track. It's not a bad song but it only sounds good in it's time i.e the 90's. I listen to it now and it sounds sooo outdated. Also ''Gone Too Soon'' (While a great song) doesn't even fit with the album and feels out of place. In fact the whole album is out of order. One minute he's trying to sound sexy, the next he wants to save the world and find God. Too much<br /><br />Overall, this was the beginning of the end of Mj's music career. He never made an album as good as his work with QJ and while I understand why he needed to move on and grow as an artist, this album did not bring the heat. He was trying too many things and sounds and this album is very hit and miss. He can't pull off New Jack Swing. Still if your an Mj fan not a bad cd to own. Just know ahead of time it's not a classic
0575083093|4.0|The story starts a little slowly, but as the various plot lines and characters begin their collision course towards each other the tension builds inexorably. The story is heavy on science, backing off just before your eyes start to glaze over and thus keeping the pacing and your interest. The story elements, characters, and world created are incredible, interesting, and make you crave more.<br /><br />Then in the last hundred pages or so everything just sort of wraps up with a \\"Well, I guess everything's okay,\\" and some characters suddenly reveal they've learned all the intricacies of the plot and recite them aloud.<br /><br />Very unsatisfying end to a riveting story.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Now let me start by writing that I like Thriller just as much as the next person, but Bad is Mj's best work hands down. This is the album where he went from ''Superstar'' to ''Pop Icon''. Some of the songs are catchy dance tracks ( Bad, Another Part of Me) while others are more playful and fun ( Smooth Criminal, Leave Me Alone). But the stand out tracks will always be Dirty Diana and Man In The Mirror.<br /><br />On Dirty Diana, Mj wrote about the groupies he come's across and how they will do anything for money and fame. It's probably the most sexy song, he's ever made. While Man In The Mirror says it all in the title. People see homeless people and children hurt all over the world but do nothing but wish things would get better. Well if you want the world to change as the song says, ''Start with the Man In The Mirror''. Change starts with YOU!<br /><br />The bonus features are ok. We hear Quincy Jones talk about Mj's writing and classic music video's and we listen to songs that didn't make the cut like Streetwalker ( I love that song and think it should have been added) and Fly Away ( It's not that great and I can see why it was left off)<br /><br />Overall, this is a great album. The only song I tend to skip over is I Just Can't Stop Loving You. It's a little to corny for my taste but still this is a 5 star album.
0962477060|5.0|I've had this book for several years and still find myself going back to it as my ultimate reference. Before I had purchased it I had been playing guitar for about 12 years. I was tired of playing other people's music and tired of playing rhythm. So one day I walked into my local guitar shop and asked an associate \\"can you recommend a book for a guy like me who wants to start soloing and know his way around the fretboard better\\"? He pointed me to Fretboard Logic. I bought it and jumped right in.     Wow! The guy who came up with this technique is a genius. I found it really easy to understand the whole CAGED sequence and it really helped me to better navigate the fretboard during improv sessions. Now I am much more confident whenever writing, jamming and improvising with other artists.    I highly recommend this to any player who is familiar with rhythm guitar, knows the basic chords and wants to further their playing.
B0000029LG|3.0|This cd was all over the place but I understand why since this cd came out after that 1st round of molest stuff. He was upset but damn this cd was very hit and miss. The first cd has some of his many classics and the second cd has all new songs. Out of all his new songs only 5 were what I call great.    1 Scream  2 They Don't Care About Us  3 You Are Not Alone  4 Stranger in Moscow  5 This Time Around    Everything else was ok. Nothing special
B000N3ST7A|5.0|I must confess, I'd like a comp with all the Fleetwood Mac Stevie,  along with the solo stuff. I'm not a fan of live performances,  unless they surpass the studio versions, but the live tracks have something to offer for sure.   That being said, I like this comp, and I can even get by the 80's period drum machine, and production, because it's Stevie, and that voice, those words, and the witchy vibe, are what draws us to her.   Pick it up for The Tom Petty colaboration \\"Stop Draggin my Heart Around\\"  and the Great version of Zeppelin's \\"Rock and Roll\\" but hey it's Stevie Nicks. It's all good.
B000VX4X36|5.0|Exactly as ordered. Have been wearing this very same shoe for twenty years. This is my 6th pair.
0316098337|4.0|Told from the perspective of a 5-year-old boy named Jack, Room is the story of a mother and her child held in captivity in a 121 square-foot room. Jack was born in the room and knows no other existence. To him, the small space is the entire world, and he and his mother are its only inhabitants. In an attempt to give her child a normal life, Jack's mother fills their days with invented games and activities using their limited possessions. At the end of each day, Jack must go to sleep in a wardrobe by 9 pm in order to avoid encountering his mother's captor (and his father), who drops by most nights to rape his female victim.<br /><br />Despite this exceedingly grim premise, Jack's innocence coupled with his mother's enduring desire to create a happy life for him ensure that Room never wallows in sadness. Jack's quirky view of his world is often humorous, and he's perfectly content with his confined life. Donoghue does an admirable job writing from the perspective of a 5-year-old, though the limitations of that perspective are occasionally tedious.  Although the first third of the novel drags a bit, after Jack's mother decides to take action to change their circumstances, the pace quickens dramatically.  Given the constraints of her protagonist's young age and limited experience, the fact that Room is such an engaging novel is a remarkable achievement.
B0040YR546|3.0|Recieved product the blu ray case was cracked at the right top corner. Disc plays very well though it was just the case that had damage.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Did my temperatures go way down so I could overclock to 4.2 GHz with ease? No. Did my temperatures go down so that I could substantially overclock without worrying about my PC exploding? Certainly.     For $30 this is a darn good cooler. The 120mm fan is sufficient but I did notice 3c-5c reduction by adding another for push/pull. Installation was difficult but it was easy enough that I accomplished it by myself and did it in under an hour.     I don't know if the design just doesn't allow for much pressure of if I used too much paste but it's certainly not as tight as I'd like it to be.    My temperatures went from 45-50c idle to 32-38 idle and from 72c load to about 64c load. Not ridiculous but I'm OC'ing to 3.5Ghz from 2.8 (Intel i7 930) and I live in a hot area so 64c is just fine.     Overall I'm happy with this cooler. Be warned: It's rather tall. I'd say it's about 6-7 inches tall and BARELY fits into my Cooler Master Centurion 590 Case; I actually had to forgo a side fan because there wasn't enough room.     If you just want a better-than-stock cooler that will get your temps down and maybe even let you Overclock a little then this will be the best $30 you ever spent. I thoroughly recommend this over the Hyper n520 as I experienced better results with this one.     If you want to go past 3.8Ghz then I highly recommend a more powerful air cooler (Noctua, Cooler Master V6 etc.) or water cooling (Build your own, H50's leak sometimes).
B000E41MRC|5.0|This is without question the premier propaganda film of all time. The simultaneous English language historical commentary included as a feature alternative in this remastered edition is a valuable addition.    Riefenstahl's use of visual image to maximize dramatic effect is outstanding. It's not surprising that this film of the 1934 Nazi Party rally was still being shown in German motion picture theaters a decade later.    A comparison of Triumph of the Will with Frank Capra's Why We Fight series of Allied propaganda films, which are also outstanding examples of the propaganda art, only proves the excellence of Riefenstahl's keen sense of political perception.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Rock singer Pink (Bob Geldof) is an angry, lonely and depressed man who use to have a wife (Eleanor David), a bad childhood as a boy (Kevin Mckeon) during the Korean war period, a rotten teacher (Alex McAvoy), a manager (Bob Hoskins), one of his fans (Jenny Wright), a mother (Christine Hargreaves) who cared for him and of course wealth, fame and fortune. But all that matters is his madness through times even by a powerful brick wall that it must be broken even if he becomes a Neo-Nazi that brings hate and all kinds of bad things.<br /><br />A unique, harrowing and exciting live-action and animated musical rock opera drama from Alan Parker and writer/singer/producer Roger Waters of \\"Pink Floyd\\" fame. This movie is about madness and how society effects him even from the days of war as a kid, he draws from the real world to fantasies. I think this movie is a powerful film that uses amazing animated sequences by Gerald Scarfe which are so unforgettable that they are iconic, the film is very faithful to the landmark album and uses medium dialog. It plays to the music of Pink Floyd as it's a surreal movie with terrific artwork and memorability but it's not for everyone.<br /><br />This DVD contains terrific picture and sound remastering like it's new with extras like unreleased film footage, Documentary on the film, commentary, retrospective 45 minute documentary, production stills and trailer.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I have had, and used, this mic for several years, and have been satisfied with it.  Two things I've learned over the years, though.  You really need a windscreen on this mic, even if used indoors.  Why?  The 'ppp' and 'ttt' popping sound from the interviewee.  And, and this is critical, you must make sure the mic is threaded properly on the talent's top.<br /><br />With a lav mic, one doesn't want the mic cord to show.  (I've done it the wrong way and it looks tacky.)  So, you thread it up the talent's top (or, rather, you have them thread the mic up).  Here's where it can go all wrong.  The mic must be positioned so the head (even with the windscreen) doesn't have a CHANCE of rubbing against clothing.<br /><br />I just did an interview, and I used the windscreen to good effect.  However, the talent was a 'mover and shaker' while being interviewed, and the windscreen touched the clothing on and off.  And boy do you notice it!<br /><br />It's a trade-off, then, with this mic.  If you don't use a windscreen, you'll hear disturbing pops from hard consonants; if you do, you have to make very, very sure the windscreen doesn't touch clothing at any point.  And try to discourage the talent from gesturing wildly, or bouncing up and down in his seat.<br /><br />It's a mixed bag, and recommended with those caveats in mind.
0385732554|5.0|I read this book in high school and it influenced the rest of my life.  It was very eye-opening =)
0312600844|4.0|I loved this book, and the negative, nit-picky reviews make me laugh.  sure there are imperfections, yes the terrain of The Corrections is revisited, but Franzen has created something fresh and new, fun and thought-provoking, and characters we care about.  Yes, some of it seems fantastical, unbelievable, but that makes it all the more fun.<br /><br />Relax everybody, buy the book and enjoy the ride!

B003ZK58WM|1.0|How can they justify a kindle version being more expensive than the hardcover?  Save your money.
B000WCBPOG|1.0|I ordered this cd in such hi hopes and of course i didn't get the right cd.  I sent an email to the company telling them they sent me the wrong cd and they told me i didn't order the deluxe edition and to check my account and i would see that i didn't.  So I checked my account AGAIN and sure enough I did indeed order the deluxe edtion that the company advertised.  So insulting when someone tells you that you made the error not them.  Especially when it's so clear to see that it was them.  They did offer to refund my money after i send back the cd at my cost and i will be refunded only the cost of the cd.  Since I have to send it back they should refund my shopping costs of sending it back.  I already paid shipping costs to receive the merchandise why should I have to pay those costs again to return their mistake?  SO NOT HAPPY!!!!
B002VPE1XE|3.0|The bag is of decent quality and not misrepresented, but I am disappointed in two things.    1. the camera is not zipped into the bag, only has velcro flap  2. the velcro belt strap is not as secure as I would like.  Pros:  1.  Has a small ring on the back that you can use a for a hook attachment  2.  Small zipper pocket in front will hold credit cards, etc (I have confirmed this).    These cons make me reluctant to use this bag in a theme park or busy event.  I think it would be fine for every day use, or to store the camera on a shelf or in a car, but I am not too wild about those two things.  The flap makes it easy to get quickly out, but also makes it easier to fall out on a roller coaster or something.  I guess it depends on what you want this bag for.
B003PIUC02|5.0|The Series is excellent, although i hoped for better packaging, and for a blu ray i was hoping there be more features then a simple menu. Overall The Quality Is Excellent. Its amazing how you can see the detail on peoples skins.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|i have just listened to it few times and its great and much better and more rocking then i thought it would be. and maybe its also that good because they know when to hold back. of course sheranian could have done more solos and so on but instead he just puts them were they are supposed to be, but i bet they changed it up a bit and jam when they play live. and saying Dream Theater went donhill after he left them is just stupid, he played on one albums wich is a very good album but most of their albums after that are better. im not gonna go over each song here, but they are all good and the playing is great as you would expect from these guys. and Glenn Hughes's voice a great as always. but i agree you either hate it or love, and thats they way it should be. not like the voices of most famous rock bands of the last 10-15 years or so where most of them sound the same and have no range, just some middle range voice that everyone can like but noone realy loves or hates.    just buy the album and give it a good listen and if you like a good rock album you will like this album.
B00018D44U|5.0|Another example of why Norah Jones continues to be one of the greats.  Destined to become a classic.
0345505387|5.0|I absolutely loved the graphic novel.  It gives Outlander a new dimension.    The illustrations were fabulous and showed so much depth into the characters emotions and thoughts.  The scenery alone was breath taking.  The art appeared to have been painted with brush strokes instead of using a computer.  How is that even possible?  The fact is, obviously, it is possible.      This is a must have for any Outlander fan and for any adult graphic novel fan too.
1416589473|5.0|This book is amazing. Simply that. I've been a major fan of the Guild Wars world and its lore for years. The story given about the past of Tyria and the Charr and Human conflict while still telling the story of the book itself was well integrated. The characters are very accurate in how I'd imagine them to act in the world itself. With the imagery helping it along, you can almost feel yourself watching the events from the sidelines.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|good movie, whiplash was great, black widow was better. if this is the way s.h.i.e.l.d. is gonna progress, im all in. blu-ray is a bit grainy, and then there are super-hidef shots, pretty annoying to me overall. either its sharp as a knife, or dull as my grandpas razor... i dont like that. (splitting hairs). good flick.
B003L77TZI|5.0|This album was really good, I was a little scared when I heard the song peacock, but other than that the rest of the songs were good. It has a funky fresh beat mixed with pop, and even a little hip hop. My favorite track is \\" Cirlce the Drain\\", which really has a good message in my opinion .However  The language in that song is a little out there, so its definately not for little teens or children, I encourage everyone to buy this Album .And try to delete the language out of your head if its a problem.<br /><br />  -N411 Journal !
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This season of Dexter is by far my favourite. Didnt think season 3 could be topped but season 4 is fantastic!
0312360258|5.0|this book is amazing the story is good, the charters are funny like Stevi Rae the cowgirl with the very strong oki twang, is Zoey's beat friend, and then there are the twins (their not really twins just best friends and rommies and are alot alike so they are nicknamed the twins) are funny, boy-crazy and a little air headed, then there's Damien he's like the scholer of their little group as he is always using words the twins don't understand, so he and them get into little scraps here and there, adn then there is Erik Night Zoey's vamp (AKA vampire) boyfriend he is the hottest guy at house of night and he's nice too! I have minor complates about the story    Dislikes  the storey ended to soon witch leaves you hangin' wantin' the next book alot.  I do not really care for so much use of curing in the story but its not that bad.    LIkes  the story was intaresting and enertaning.  1 of the goals was to have the teens in this book talk like real teens and I think they did a very good job with that one.  you can re-read the book and still have it be intaresting to you I have already read it twice I finshed 1 day and re-read the next.  I like Zoey's attiude about smokeing, driking and doing drugs I like that she doesn't like those kinda things and way would some one they turn you into a complete and utter idoit.    I love this book but it does contain cusing, and in some later books as referlls to sex in them, so I would not recomend these books for anyone under 13, and for the people who think these books suck, they are very good they relate to teens very good and I am 15 so I can tell you that this book is writen how teens really talk and if you are looking for grammer do your lookin' somewhere else and stop complaining bout these books because they really talk like teens in the book
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|I think Kelly was going for edgy, but she failed miserably.  She screams her way through most of this album and the music seems too strong even for that.  I think this is her worst album so far.
B003YCI1PM|3.0|Gomez has a good voice and a sweet sound that is attractive to pre-teen listeners.  This album has four or five really catchy cuts, but the entire thing is over-produced to the point that in the middle of a song you are noticing the production more than her voice. She sings every song the same way (it doesn't help that many songs are basically about the same subject of breaking up with a boy) and doesn't seem to emotionally connect to some of the words.  One song in particular is out of place for an artist that appeals to children (Rock God).This is another example of a teen singer with a decent voice trying to grow up too soon.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|The best Book i have ever read...and I have read plenty. Tis is such a moving, sad, scary look into the life of people in Africa, and what they are exposed to through out their life. I could have never imagined that some actualy treat the people of their nation like that. I was shocked and overwelmed with emotion as I read this memoire of Ishmael Beah. I beleive this should be required reading materiel for the 12th grade, so all americans will know just how lucky we are to be a free nation. THIS IS A MUST READ! I could not put it down, I read this book in two days. Ishmael Beah you are amazing for your triumphs and I am so glad you shared your story with us.
B000W4HIXQ|3.0|As i said in the headline, i think this is worst of the first 3 films. Seems like with each sequel, they made less action scenes. I think the first film had enough action, then the second film had a less action, and the third film have much less action scenes.<br /><br />I did not like this development after each film. This film had probably just 10 minutes of action scenes. That is disappointing. I also think they shouldn`t have made Samuel L. Jackson`s character a hostile racist. He evens teach his kids to be racists. I think he has a funny scene on the boat with a gun.<br /><br />Picture Quality: 4.5/5<br /><br />I think it looks more shaper and detailed compared to the previous film. That is good. I think it has enough improvement to warrant a slightly higher rating from 4.0 that i gave the 2 previous films to 4.5.<br /><br />Audio Quality: 4/5<br /><br />Since this film has little and short action scenes, the rears are mostly used when they run in the streets or such. I think the bass sounds good coming from the subwoofer, when we hear explosions and those big trucks. The dialog sounds a times a bit low. I don`t think this is the best film, if you want to show of your 5.1 system.<br /><br />Film: 3/5<br />Overall: 3.5/5
B002VECLVO|1.0|This is possible the worst movie that I have seen in a long long time. I normally like the stars, but the glamorization of gay life is offensive. I don't want to watch gay intimacy and that is what you get here. I never liked any character in this movie. don't waste your time or money.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Slim packaging, everything came in perfect shape.  All the discs played first time, and all three films only cost only a little more than the Bourne Ultimatum by itself.
B00275EGX8|4.0|Some of the negative reviews on here reveal an unbelievable level of stupidity by the general viewing public. This is NOT a documentary. While I appreciate the service-people who have pointed out the discrepancies, I, as a viewer, am fully cognizant of the fact this is a FICTIONALIZED account. As per criticism that the film doesn't have enough \\"story\\", this is simply a stylistic choice by the filmmakers. Like it or don't like it, that's a personal choice, but not an indictment of the filmmakers' competence. I found the film to be plenty engaging and I'm not surprised it received the accolades it did. There are always going to be the clueless who fail to \\"get it\\" or grasp what the filmmakers are trying to do, and there's nothing we can really do about those morons but to put up with them. Furthermore, the lawsuit by Voltage against the \\"fans\\" who were illegally downloading the film is entirely appropriate. Action should be taken against these criminals and they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. These are not \\"fans\\", they're bottom-feeders freely benefiting from the creativity and hard work of the creators of this film who deserve to be compensated for their product. Any criticism toward \\"greedy\\" Voltage is a woefully and transparently misdirected level of indignation that should be turned back on the perpetrators of the crime.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I will not go much into the plot of this or other books since other reviewers already do this better than I could.  I just finished this book last night. I read them because of their popularity, thought I would give them a shot.  I enjoyed the first 2 books very much to my surprise as I am not at all a fan of war related books or movies.  Ultimately, this last book depicts the absolute tragedy of war and how the innocent are also victims.  This book was a lot more graphically violent than the others.  There was more descriptive detail on how victims died than there was of the romance intertwined between the characters which I found somewhat disappointing.  I was very emotionally drained by the end and saddened by the overall outcome.  Without giving away the ending, Katniss does choose between Peeta and Gale in the end, but, I was left feeling incomplete because there was not any real relationship anymore with the one not chosen, and I would have liked to know how things ended up for him.  It explains where he goes and what he is doing as far as a job, but it is assumed he and Katniss have no contact anymore after her choice is made which I feel would not be the case considering how close they all were no matter who her ultimate choice was.  I would have felt better if the author would have added even a little hint that they were all still friends.  I would call this a bittersweet ending, but overall, it was an excellent trilogy.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|Eric's new album \\"Clapton\\" is a rather unlikely mix of old blues songs, original modern songs and standards from the 30s/40s. The record features old pals like J.J. Cale, drummer Jim Keltner, bassist Willie Weeks, guitarists Derek Trucks and Doyle Bramhall (who also produces), with keyboard player Walter Richmond being outstanding throughout. Don't expect any guitar pyrotechnics from Clapton, as with most of his recent records this is very much a band record, where he often leaves solos to Trucks, Bramhall or others but the solos he does play are typically tasteful and succinct. As someone who first came to Clapton with the Yardbirds I love to hear him playing with harp players, and there are few better than Kim Wilson, I liked all the blues tracks here but then again we know Eric can do blues. However, I was worried when I heard the album also featured standards but by-and-large I thought the standards worked OK, with a couple being really nice - although I did think that Eric's voice struggled on a few of them. I was less keen on the modern songs, which in the main seemed fairly ordinary to me.<br /><br />Overall the album is quite a pleasing mixture - rather than going down the route of a whole album of standards (a la Rod Stewart) Eric leavens the mix by including the blues and modern tracks. In particular I thought that the more jazzy tracks worked very well and that is an area I'd like to see him pursuing more in future, with his guitar working along with the horns.<br /><br />Blues - The album opens with Lil' Son Jackson's `Travelin' Alone' a typical laid-back Clapton blues, we also get the old Snooky Prior song `Judgement Day' featuring doo-wop backing vocals and rather restrained blues harp from Kim Wilson. Kim makes up for this with dirty electric harp on a very authentic sounding version of Little Walter's `Can't Hold Out Much Longer', which even features a brief blues guitar solo from Eric. `That's No Way to Get Along' by Robert Wilkins sounds like the Stones `Prodigal son', with Clapton and Cale swapping vocals but leaving the guitar solos to Doyle Bramhall. The final blues Lane Hardin's `Hard Time Blues' is like an outtake from `Eric Clapton Unplugged', a great semi-acoustic loping blues with mandolin and a lovely slide guitar solo.<br /><br />Standards - The standards start with a nice relaxed reading of Hoagy Carmichael's `Rocking chair', with a great, lyrical Derek Trucks slide guitar solo and the whole thing sounding positively modern. `How Deep Is The Ocean' by Irving Berlin and `My Very Good Friend The Milkman' are done very sensitively but for me don't really go anywhere, apart from Wynton Marsalis's beautiful trumpet and (Sir?) Alan Toussaint's piano. I did particularly like Fats Waller's `When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful' with its Dixieland jazz sound, again featuring Wynton Marsalis on trumpet. Finally Johnny Mercer's `Autumn Leaves' is done very traditionally with an orchestra and surprisingly a subtle restrained blues guitar solo that fits in very well.<br /><br />Modern songs - I wasn't so keen on the J.J. Cale songs `River Runs Deep' and `Everything Will Be Alright' which were very tasteful and typically laid-back but which we seem to have heard many times before. Doyle Bramhall's ballad `Diamonds Made From Rain' where Clapton is joined by Sheryl Crow on backup vocals, is the most modern sounding song and will apparently be the single. The rocking `Run Back To Your Side' by Clapton and Bramhall is like something from one of Clapton's Tulsa-inspired 70's releases, complete with backing singers and all three guitarists adding licks.l son', with Clapton and Cale swapping vocals but leaving the guitar solos to Doyle Bramhall.

0451197879|2.0|Very well written and one I hadn't read before (thought I'd read all the Bachman books) and I kept waiting for that \\"Stephen King\\" thang to happen and it never did. The story was horribly depressing and, IMHO, pointless. If I had known it was going to be just another descent-into-madness story, I would never have bought it. It just lacked SK's magic.

0545265355|5.0|The pacing of this book is spectacular. It is written in plain English, so middle and high school students will be able to read this book without searching for a dictionary. I really enjoyed how much this book focused on survival, and what it means to have a survivalist mentality, especially when survival is facing off against morality. It is dark and violent in places, so you may want to read these books before allowing your child to read them.<br /><br />This is the sort of fast-paced, suspenseful read that can be completed in one sitting. Katniss is quite a dynamic character as she grows into adulthood all too quickly. The setting descriptions, and this world that Collins has created, will make you want to see the movie.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study has changed my life.  The science it presents behind the benefits of the plant-based diet is thorough and amazing. The evidence it presents about how the medical establishment, the drug industry, and all the animal-based food industries(milk, cattle, eggs, etc.) significantly influence how nutrition is viewed and studied and presented to the public in this country is truely scary.  And what a society of sick people we really are with our chronic diseases!  Since reading this book and changing my diet to a plant-based diet I have also dropped 10 pounds (and I was thin to begin with) and I feel better.  This book is interesting to read and a total revelation.  I highly recommend it.

Sadly most of the people who starred in it have passed on (Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin to name a few). And it was cool to see a very young Jackie Chan. All in all a very good 90 minutes spent.

0316098337|4.0|Reason for Reading: With this subject matter, who is *not* wanting to read this book?<br /><br />A 26 year old woman has been kidnapped and held captive in a soundproof, escape-proof 11 x 11 foot Room for 7 years. She has a five year old son, Jack. She cares for him fiercely and has created a world for him out of that Room, giving him everything she possibly can that he needs to grow properly, physically and emotionally. They do daily exercises, she teaches him, etc. This is their story, of their day-to-day life, their escape and how they cope on the Outside. A truly fascinating story to start with is only topped by the fact that it is told in the first person narrative of five year old Jack.<br /><br />I'm going to start by saying this is a hard review for me to write. I agonized over my rating. There is not doubt that Room is a wonderful piece of writing. The subject matter is enticing and the reality of the situation has been explored to such detail that one is amazed the author could have thought of some things without having actually experienced captivity herself. The book is divided into distinct sections, each one focusing intensely on a certain stage of Jack and Ma's story. Donoghue has managed to write about a horrific situation without ever actually putting in print any scenes that show the obvious s*xual violence that was perpetrated. In the hands of a lesser author this could have become a much more graphic story thus losing Ms. Donoghue's perceptive touch. The book reads fast, is compelling and is tremendously well written.<br /><br />So why is this review hard to write? I didn't love the book. Yes, it was good. Good enough to keep me reading, and reading quickly too. The second half was better than the first, as in enjoying the story and the characters. I really enjoyed the introduction of Grandpa Leo, Steppa. He was the most real character in the whole book. I often found myself annoyed while reading the book. The child's narrative just didn't win me over. I didn't hate it but it felt detached somehow and thus I felt detached from the characters. I never had any great emotional response to the boy and his mother, which *really* wanted to have. None of the other characters were fully developed, even Steppa , but he at least had the behaviour of a real person and came to life for me.<br /><br />As you can see I had problems with the book, while appreciating it. Now that I've finished it, my immediate response is \\"Yeah, it was good.\\" I wouldn't grab people and say you *must* read this book, but if anyone asked me I'd recommend it with my reservations as noted above. I may feel differently about my rating a month (a year) from now but it's been 6 days since I've written this review and I still feel the same way. Very well written, but only good, not great.ut it felt detached somehow and thus I felt detached from the characters.

B003UPPO3A|4.0|I continue to be amazed by the evolution of Brian Wilson, a musician who I almost wrote off completely after he disappeared from The Beach Boys and continued on a downward spiral for awhile. But he has returned in fine form, not a surprise to fans who have followed his work in recent years. In this particular effort, potential listeners should not expect traditional renditions of Gershwin classics. Otherwise, why would this be titled \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershwin\\"? While the point may be debatable, I think of a reimagined work as different from an interpreted one. Wilson has taken Gershwin as a starting point but trademark Beach Boys as well as Wilson sound is clear throughout - in some parts definitely harking back to Beach Boys days, with lush, full and playful sounds serving as backdrops to the main tunes.<br /><br />Having noted that, this is a work which varies in quality. You're likely to enjoy every song if you are open to Gershwin with a definite Brian Wilson take. Then there are some truly stellar pieces, including \\"Summertime\\". I'm very picky when it comes to interpretations of this particular song and Wilson's version is now among my top choices. However, I found it very strange to hear Wilson singing \\"I loves you Porgy\\" without altering the words to fit a male take. This meant that he sung (in parts) about being handled by a man. It seemed strange.<br /><br />Not all critics have written glowing of this latest offering by Wilson but I liked it so much that I felt compelled to get the vinyl edition. There continues to be debate about the quality of vinyl compared to CDs and I am on the fence about this debate. However, I think this may potentially be collectible. Again, a debatable point, especially for those who can't get into this CD or vinyl album.<br /><br />If you are a strict traditionalist and like to hear Gershwin without the layers added by Wilson's team then you might want to sample an MP3 or two before buying the entire album. But if you are familiar with Wilson's often original spin and unique gifts, you won't be disappointed with \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershin\\" (with a distinct emphasis on \\"reimagines\\"). Even the very familiar songs have a jazzier or more upbeat tempo (for the most part).on's often original spin and unique gifts, you won't be disappointed with \\"Brian Wilson Reimagines Gershin\\" (with a distinct emphasis on \\"reimagines\\").

0307592839|3.0|Jennifer Egan's new novel, A Visit from the Goon Squad, presents a cast of characters in the music business during various time periods in their lives. Jumping back and forth, she riffs like a musician as she deepens our understanding of the lives and times of the characters. Time is the goon. We change in ways that can improve our lives, and in ways that lead to decline and decay. In some ways, the music remains constant, and in other ways, new music emerges from new life experiences. Egan's writing keeps readers engaged, provided one remains patient with the shifting time periods. Any reader who enjoys novels that reveal insights into our human condition will likely enjoy this book.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|The writer of the HBO series, Terence Winter (who also wrote the foreword for this edition of the book), was recently interviewed on public radio and explained how and why the HBO show deviates from many of the facts in the book \\"Boardwalk Empire.\\" Last names were sometimes changed and certain information had to be imagined or created in order to allow the plot to veer away from the events in the book. Hence,  Nucky \\"Thompson\\" in the series is actually based on the real life Nucky (Enoch) Johnson<br /><br />None of this takes away from the entertainment value of the series but potential buyers of the book will get an added perspective and accurate historical detail.\\"Boardwalk Empire\\" is an excellent way to round out the very entertaining cable television series. If you simply want to watch the show, it recreates Atlantic City in its heyday. Steve Buscemi is riveting in his role as \\"Nucky\\" and comes across as a complex person, although when it comes to business he can be harsh and no nonsense. Things go his way or else. Of course, I write this after seeing only the first episodes of the series so it will be interesting to see how his character evolves. There are hints of a romance in the future.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Terence Winter (again, writer of the HBO series) also wrote many episodes of The Sopranos and director Martin Scorcese steps to the helm and directs the first and possibly many more episodes of the cable show ( but guest directors aren't uncommon for cable series). In the show, Steve Buscemi plays Nucky but Winter has admitted that James Gandolfini would have fit the actual body type and appearance of Nucky. But because Buscemi captures the essence of Nucky so well it doesn't seem to matter if he looks exactly like the real Nucky.<br /><br />Nucky Johnson provides what people want, primarily alcohol, gambling and sex. But if the public had wanted other things Nucky would simply have gone with public sentiment. His choices were based on what brought him the most profit -and it was as simple as that, although being in power was not so simple.<br /><br />Having seen the first episodes of the series, I am able to compare both the book and television show. I'd urge you to buy the book. Both the book and the cable series made me yearn to visit Atlantic City in its prime. Women dressed in their finest outfits before strolling on the actual boardwalk. I'd love to have revisited that time - if only to understand the thrills that drew people to Atlantic City.<br /><br />Since I've now seen the series, it is impossible to write about the book without comparing it to the film version. I have to admit that the HBO show recreates Atlantic City's mixture of people and often weird attractions, from side shows to palm readers - and it does make a difference seeing and hearing the combination of sights, sounds and dialogue.<br /><br />There is also a portrayal of the young Al Capone and he comes off as far less confident in his youth. He still takes risks but he hasn't matured into the experienced man whose name became legend.<br /><br />\\"Boardwalk Empire\\" reveals how the area was a place where families came, with children enjoying themselves by day and adults venturing off to enjoy other pursuits at night. You won't get a truly balanced historical take on Atlantic City without reading the book and the series should motivate viewers to want to learn more about the history of Atlantic City's entertainment area.<br /><br /> Reading \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" is well worth the time.

0596522347|5.0|I really found a lot to like about this book. I enjoy books where seasoned professionals attempt to write up their job and pass their wisdom onto others. This is one of those books.    I felt like I was getting private coaching from a high-end designer. I'm an engineer with a good amount of real-world marketing, PR and presentation experience. This was an eye opener because there were several mistakes I was making that I was able to correct, and there were many \\"aha\\" moments where I was doing things but didn't have any of the theory as to why.    My only quibble is that the book is formatted squarely; I had the e-book, so I cropped it to read on my iPad. Buy the print version if you want the full experience.

0061537969|5.0|One of my book-club books.  That being said I was surprised and impressed by the delivery of the story.  Enzo, the dog, talks about his human world from a unique perspective that allows a very visceral understanding of human emotion and impending disaster as well as the frustrations inherent in being mute in a world of complex language.  It allows the narrator to both avoid the clich&eacute;d scenes and present the human world stripped down to its essential qualities: predator-pray, the insidiousness of evil, the inability to save a loved one, despair, fortitude.  Because Enzo is a dog these revelations fall naturally from his mind, without reinterpretation, and the reader is left to worry about the impending disaster that the dog perceives but doesn't fully understand.<br />  Most of the story is told in memory but at the essential point you realize that this did not completely answer the story question.  It is, by its nature internal monologue but I do enjoy these types of books.  I would compare this to White Oleander in that the narrator has a unique perspective and very little actual control over the event that transpire but without the extensively poetic and languid pace of Janet Fitch's novel.  The racing vignettes slowed the pace down a little and if I were writing the novel I would have pulled some of them.<br /><br />My rating scale -<br />5 stars: (Top 10%) - Will re-read and recommend it to friends even if it's not their genre.<br />4 stars: (20%) - Will re-read.<br />3 stars: (40%) - Worth reading, won't buy in hard cover or re-read.<br />2 stars:  (20%) - Regret buying and reading, will avoid author.<br />1 star: (10%) - No story and very poor writing.
B00065MDSG|3.0|\\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" released in 1973 is King Crimson's fifth album. Musically, there have been radical changes since the symphonic debut \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\" from 1969. The magnificent melodic numbers are replaced by complex compositions, where the melodic only in flashes are predominant. It's obvious that the group under its distinctive musical metamorphosis has lost some fans but on the other hand has managed to win others.<br /><br />The fact that the musical changes have been so striking, is partly due to large changes in the group's lineup. Thus it is only guitarist Robert Fripp, who is left from 1969 debut. This is only a part of the explanation, because there is little doubt that leader Robert Fripp, never had any desire simply to repeat himself, but always wanted to explore new musical expressions.<br /><br />Half of \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\" is instrumental, with the two title tracks playing more than twenty minutes. These numbers are pretty complex, especially Part One contains several very different sequences, some of which may be heavy for the ear.<br /><br />Also \\"The Taking Drum\\" is instrumental, and as the title suggests, the number is a showcase for drummer Bill Bruford. It should be no secret that these types of instrumentals are not really my cup of tea, so I must resort to the second half of the album to find numbers that justify expanding my music collection with the album.<br /><br />There are fine things in the short and quiet \\"Book of Saturday\\", though John Wetton never reaches the magic of Greg Lake. The closest you get to the classic King Crimson sound  is on \\"Exiles\\" which has some of the melodic approach that typified the group's earliest albums.<br /><br />\\"Easy Money\\" is more hard hitting, and it can glimpsewise appear reminiscent of Pink Floyd. The group's desire to experiement is also reflected in these vocal-numbers, but they are generally more accessible, and the reason why I still think that the album belongs to a King Crimson collection.

0316067938|1.0|While I fell in love with Edward and Bella and the rest of the Cullens, I believe that Meyer should have made an ending with the 3rd book.     Meyer failed to recognize the age group of her readers. Meyer has always lacked action in her vampire books. Lets make this highly emotional passionate love story, with no physical passion. Hello, I was looking for a crazy sex scene FINALLY in the last book, and all I get is when they wake up she is pregnant. Talk about a good way to get kids afraid of sex! If you have sex children, you will get pregnant and die...unless you turn into a vampire.     I thought that finally near the end of the book, Meyer was going to add action with the Vultouri. Instead of a war, they TALK about it. THIS IS A VAMPIRE STORY! Not tea time!     Jacob imprinted on a baby, that is just....sick.     Does anyone ever feel that Meyer randomly uses a thesaurus?     I could go on, but I was saved. I was saved by the Sookie Stackhouse books. Where vampires burned in the sun, where there was CRAZY hot sex scenes, thrilling action and drama, death, blood, and a twisted ending. If you want to forget about this Meyer let down, try Harris' books, you will feel much better.

I got a couple of wooden sticks at the craft shop for two bucks and they work great! I love the method they describe; it's easy to do. I really appreciated the tips for freezing, mailing and storing. I've made the basic vanilla and chocolate cookies which were really good, with a subtle sweetness--so a nice blank canvas for the other sugar and toppings you're going to put on. I made the dough with pecans as well; it's fine, but a little too crumbly and rich-tasting for me. I just have another pecan shortbread recipe I like better, I guess...
B000MMMT46|5.0|I heard this band played on a local college radio station in Nebraska, and had to hear more.  I was VERY happy to find it on vinyl at Amazon.    This is Good time-Irish-Celtic-Punk-Folk-Country... I think.    I don't know how else to describe this, but it is very good stuff.

B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Thinking I had bought the Vox amPlug AC30, I found this one in the mail instead. But krikey, this thing blasts! No regrets whatsoever. I bought it as gadget really, not regarding it as something serious but it has amazed me quite a bit. Now I can be bring my electric with me traveling and still play the way I want to (rather than being 'stuck' with an acoustic). Of course it is limited to playing clean or heavily distorted, but it does these things very well.    Not sure if Fenders have different jacks (one reviewer reports it won't fit on strat models), but my Squier strat easily allows the amplug to be attached to it. I use it on my bass guitar as well - clean, as with distortion it sounds terrible, and its sounds pretty darn good. Even on my cheapo logitech computer speakers (with woofer) it is quite good.    I highly recommend it. Count your coins though, as some are so enthousiastic they want to get all the amplug varieties. Buy 4 of them and you spend about the same money as a Korg Pandora which is far more versatile.

That being said Halcyon is a natural progression of the band and their shift from visceral ambient punk to what I would call purgatory pop, pop melodies with lyrics that suggest regret and missed opportunities in a very ambivalent way, not hell but definitely not heaven either.  Songs like Revival, Coronado and Memory Boy show excellent song craftsmanship and put a refreshing lo-fi twist on \\"psychedelic 60s\\" sound and with a saxophone to boot that sounds like its going through some of the same distortion as the guitars!  The influence of MBV has always been there for Deerhunter, as well as many others, but they have extracted every bit of beauty out of the wall of sound effect in songs like Desire Lines and Fountain Stairs.  Speaking of which, how great is it for Deerhunter to have two amazing singers.  Songs like Sailing show, to me, the band or Bradford's acceptance of his past for what it is rather than anger towards it (see Wash Off, Cryptograms etc), stating \\"only fear can make you feel lonely out here, you learn to accept whatever you can get.\\" All in all a great lo-fi pop album, but again for those of you expecting a Nirvana, circa In Utero, return to the savage ambiance and punk ascetic of their first album you wont find it here.  4 stars only because I personally like their older stuff better but Deerhunter are among a very select few that are putting out better and better music with each subsequent album.  Looking forward to the future of Deerhunter :)
0670021652|4.0|Committed is a non-fiction book entertwined with Gilbert's personal reflection on how the history, statistics, and socio-economic-political-religious underpinnings of marriage guide her to accept the necessity of marriage in order to stay with Felipe in the U.S. As someone married for almost 40 years and at times ambivalent about marriage, I found that the various strands of research added much to psychoanalysis on why one gets married, divorced, or stays in a marriage and outside pressures that make it that way. My only negative comment is that toward the last 40 pages or so, I began to say to myself, \\"Methinks she dost protest too much,\\" or whine might be a better term for protest. Marriage is what it is, and she presented contributing factors that make up this elephant very well. I've recommended it to a friend burned by marriage and in her early 40s and a man who is 47, never married, happily having new relationships serially every 3-7 years, but both are beginning to feel the loneliness that comes with changes at this point in life (boring jobs, career stalls, not being so \\"cute\\" and charming anymore, family culture-based pressures to get married). I do hope they read it because it actually offers hope once one considers how marriage is part of society-- not just the legitimization of passion expressed through sex-- which won't last forever, anyway.

0718148576|2.0|Just finished the book today.  Great insights, and lots of wisdom about the influence of the ego.    However, I think his philosophy of \\"formlessness\\" has some major drawbacks, which show up most obviously in his writing style.  Reading this book gave me the impression that his confidence in present-tense intuition caused him to the right the book without any thought or effort to restrain himself or organize the material--no planning whatsoever. It's great information, but it's very repetitive, not very scholarly, and uses very little specific examples to illustrate points.     Also, it's all just his opinions, written in a rambling style, without any reference to authority beyond himself, the Bible, and a few buddhist quotes.  This wouldn't be so bad if it was a testimonial or a personal philosophy, but it's not.  It's a treatise on how the world is, and how we operate, and how the terrible ego is to blame for everything from cancer to PMS.    Maybe read his other book \\"power of now\\" first.
0441018866|4.0|Great book, start to finish.  The use of time scale is novel and worth the read in and of itself.    Due to the ending, I did not give it 5 stars, but it's definitely close (maybe 4 1/2).
B000G6R7B8|5.0|excellent, attractive/designer styling, functional watch for work or play, with a sturdy/heavy nylon band.  I love self-winding Seikos. And the price is very reasonable. When the band gets dirty I'm going to remove it and throw it in the washing machine; what more could you ask for.
0385342047|5.0|I've know Becky Bloomwood since her first overdraft and always look forward to \\"spending\\" time with her whether she's tramping up 5th Avenue, climbing the side of a mountain, searching for her half-sister or in the latest installment, being a mum to a tantrum throwing toddler.  So begins Sophie Kinsella's latest in the saga of her popular shopaholic series.      The book opens on Christmas Eve at a shopping mall where little Minnie, now two years old, begins to throw a fit when she sees a toy pony that initially Becky doesn't want to purchase.  In standard Becky fashion, she finds a reason to cave (much the same rationale permeates the entire series - it's on sale, it's a one-off, it's a classic, etc.) and averts disaster, only temporarily.  A hilarious, albeit mortifying, incident ensues at Santa's Grotto where the whole family is banned for life.    This scene opens one of the major plotlines of the novel, Minnie's out of control nature.  Many hilarious toddler problems ensue and Nanny Sue (a TV nanny comes to the rescue, but not before a comical mannequin incident).  With typical Becky flair, she finds her way into a myriad of problems such as planning a surprise party for Luke trying to utilize the bartering system because of the economic downturn.      On some level, Becky is still Becky.  Shopping, scheming, lying and keeping secrets, but somehow she manages to endear herself to you; because you know she's harmless and truly means well.  Like all the novels, everything ties up neatly at the end in this installment also and we are left wondering/knowing/hoping that another tale of Becky shopping till she drops is soon to follow. Minishopaholic is a fun, fast chick-lit read.  If you've enjoyed the others in the series you'll love this one.
B003UERZ88|5.0|Magnificent CD worth its weight in gold. Lots of depth of material here and it's good to see Robs creative side has not waned one bit. Love this CD from start to finish. The opener just kicks and \\"the mower\\" is a nasty rocker that just opens up Robs personal depth and fury. I also think made of metal is a great song that differs to what you would expct. Its good to see Halford are getting better and better as a band both with the edginess of Robs creative direction and the musicianship of the band. Great stuff, go get it.

B000NQRR1Q|5.0|When The Ninth Gate (1999) was released, the critics that expected more than just a good movie from Roman Polanski (1933), a famous filmmaker who made such a brilliant pictures as Chinatown (1974) and Rosemary's Baby (1968), were disappointed. It is not hard to be a good director: made one good movie, made another, found your place under the sun and your fans. But, if you made one great movie, be aware that your fans won't forgive you for crap in the future and critics will gladly stomp all over you for ruining your own standards.<br />  In 1999 every a little intelligent person, everyone who watches TV news or reads newspapers knows Roman Polanski if not as famous director but at least as participant of sexual scandal back in 1974. His movies Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby are world renown and still hold high rankings in respectful tabloids.  But scandal reputation doesn't stand on his way to making relatively good movies, write screenplays, and act himself. If there is an example of the person who magnets bad things, that's Roman Polanski. If there is an example of a person who endures and overcomes tragedy with maximum profit, then that's also Roman Polanski. As you can read on [...], the author of Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, and Repulsion (1965) was born in Poland in 1933; he lived thru terrible Nazi ghetto in Krakow while his parents died in concentration camp. This was just the beginning of the tragedies. Once he finished his movie Knife in Water (1962), after he just married Sharon Tate and moved to the USA with his wife (during the final months of pregnancy), she was kidnapped, tortured and killed by Charles Manson and his henchmen. This event put him out of balance for a long time and in a couple years in 1979 he permanently left the USA because of a lawsuit against him which accused him of violating 13 years-old girl in Jack Nicolson house (he ran away not long before the trial). So by 1999 Polanski is both famous and infamous. His Chinatown (1974) won an Oscar in nomination the \\"Best Writing, Original Screenplay\\" and 18 other wins amongst 22 nominations. Polanski also likes to act in his movies, mostly in episodes in Chinatown and Dance of the vampires (1967). He's also a brilliant writer. Sometimes he'd write by himself (Rosemary's Baby, Tragedy of Macbeth (1971)) but usually as a co-writer of John Browniohn and Gerard Brach (Pirates (1986), Tess (1979), Frantic (1988), Bitter Moon (1992)). The Ninth Gate was also co-written by Brownjohn and Enrique Urbizy adopting the novel El Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte. The Ninth gate is almost European movie. All session were made in Paris, Lissabon, and Spain. Maybe that's why the movie didn't make much in the USA. According to The Art and Popular Culture Encyclopedia, the budget of the movie was 38.000.000$ (probably Johnny's toll). Well USA collections are only $18.000.000. It still sad because The Ninth Gate is not a soup opera, but worldwide was better in collections with $58,401,898 so in the end they covered the budget.<br />  The Ninth Gate is not in the list of top 250 by IMDB as a great movie, which disappoints, but it's in the top 100 of worst movies, which is still something. So what's wrong? In The Ninth Gate Polanski ones again refers to complicated relationship of Human&Devil. It is a hot topic and Rosemary's Baby was a success. But Polanski could not repeat it even thou he took part in writing the screenplay. Not a single critic had anything positive to say about the movie after the release. Some were less rude, like Leah Rozen from People Weekly, who lets us know that The Ninth Gate is the weakest of a genre but is still earns some points for black humor and with Johnny Depp's acting alone he can improve even the silliest of movies; being co-written and directed by Roman Polanski, Ninth Gate adds another page into book of devil after Rosemary's Baby even if not as bright, but still of high rank (Leah 32). Stanly Kauffmann from The New Republic is less patient. He does not like neither Johnny Depp, nor screenplay, nor Seigner, nor anything. Weak character development with no plus to their appearance makes a bad impression of the movie. And his review ends with sentence \\"This picture is stupid\\"(Kauffmann 25). Antony Lane form The Current Cinema says that there is nothing to watch in this movie besides naked Emmanuelle Seigner (Lane 145). Critic from ReelViews also writes the movie is utterly simple and mindless; it leaves no food for thought and looks like a chaotic mix of genres without a proper direction. Next he adds that maybe a bad translation of the novel The Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte which Polanski adopted for screenplay (Berardinelly). It's interesting that in an interview that Polanski gave after the premier of The Ninth Gate in Poland he doesn't see any negative sides to the movie. He says that the screenplay is perfect, special effects are great and that he knowshow to make a movie better than anyone and he doesn't give a damn about critics: they do their job; he does his (Fuchs).<br />  Polanski loves his movies like parents love their children. But what about the watchers? Those people who pay money to see this movie, those who make decision to see the movie. It's been 10 years since the movie's release. Are people still watching it? Yes, they continue to watch it and share their impressions and besides. They do not get paid for that, so their opinion is the most valuable and objective. For instance Patrick Galagan finds that regardless of flaws in screenplay and slow pace the movie still has many positive sides.  But at the same time he doesn't forget to point out that tension rises perfectly accompanied by soundtracks and music throughout the movie, simply charming; Patrick also finds comparison with Good acting by Johnny Depp who acts a bastard who cares only about his reward and nothing can possibly stop him from completing the task and collecting it; also Galagan finds that Polanski is following the old Hitchcock's school of classic thriller (Galagan).  Majority like this movie. According to [...] rating, the movie has 6.6 rating and 120 people from 370 who liked to write releases on Amazon.com and ranked it with 5 stars and only 20 gave one star.<br />  I purposefully haven't read the positive reviews from Amazon because I intended to write a positive review myself. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is frankly successful and slightly arrogant detective book-seller whose specials is selling and buying very rare books. One of his regular clients Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) has a unique library with rarest foliants which are dedicated to Satan and his traditions. One of these books called The Ninth Gate was co-written by Lucifer himself and according to rumors contains knowledge of summoning the devil (to mention book's release date was in 1666). Apparently, Balkan had tried to use this book to provoke Lucifer. That unpleasant subject (why Balkan needs it is for everyone to wonder, but well... who'd resist summoning Satan and chat with him) but he got nothing. Balkan knows there are two more editions of the book somewhere and while he isn't sure his book is an original he gets Dean to take his version and compare it to others. Large fortune is offered for this job and Dean agrees to carry out the task with all due haste, although his regular life of cynical rare book-hunter starts to crumble due to various events occurring around him and the books (such as murderers). But that isn't Devils toll yet. It just happens there are other people who'd loved to dial Lord of Lies on cell phone. In search of two other copies Dean sets off to Europe and finds two other owners. In his investigation he realizes that all three books are originals and differ from each other only in graviours. And on top of that some of them have initials that refer to Lucifer. In order to get a full picture you have to have all three books and all of the pictures in them. But all of a sudden abig fuss starts around Dean and the books where he's being targeted, other owner's getting killed, some green-eye Girl ( Roman Polanski's wife  Emmanuelle Seigner) who is part-time guardian-angel whose identity of intentions remain secret. There is no point telling of what happens further or it won't be interesting to watch the movie, so let's talk about what it looks like.<br />  The Ninth Gate is a very slow movie but it makes a good mystic atmosphere. This atmosphere is the base of the movie. Polanski is a master of tension and in this case he equalized it throughout the movie. Landscapes and the cities around which the movie takes place are gorgeous: couple ancient castles, empty Spain streets with walls on sides, huge mansion. It all supports the atmosphere. And of course - books, old books with creepy pictures, old libraries... What can possibly be more mystic? The Ninth Gate did not become a masterpiece, two hours are a little bit too much for it, but people who like slow detectives and mystic will still like it. It's fairly hard to discuss Roman Pulaski's art. Never in his whole life did he consider basic models of creating a movie. He proves it with his The Ninth Gate yet again. It's good for starters. There is no one in The Ninth Gate who will guide you during the screenplay and lore, exploring the key moments while delivering the main idea in the end. Forget about it. You'll have to force your brain out to guess or understand what is where, whose and why. At some point Polanski is trying to answer questions known only to him and at some points he's just being silly thus makes the movie incomprehendable. It is like a thick fog above the swamp and everyone sees what he thinks in it. I watched The Ninth Gate over a couple times to remember it. But I didn't rent this movie; I bought a DVD because I have a bad habit of buying good movies for my collection. I remember how I went to premiere with my friends and we couldn't buy tickets that evening. We went to the cinema next morning and the movie theatre was full even then. We were very astonished by The Ninth Gate that we've discussed it for an hour after the movie was over. And we saw this movie very differently. Some of my friends said that there is a question of culture development: God or the Devil. Some said that the main character is Dean and that Devil seduces him with money in order to take his soul. Some said that Polanski is parodying famous movies. They all were correct. Each of person will find something he thinks about in this movie and Polanski made sure that the majority of questions will remain  without answers, most answers are on different questions and most characters would pop up from nowhere and late on vanish again for no apparent reason or cause. Movie ending is a complete prank by Polanski. I personally witnessed few watchers who yelled, \\"WTF\\" because Polanski stopped the movie in the meanest way (as musicians say - finished with seventh chord without any resolution) which enraged many. While the other half of the watchers quickly explained, it's all right and is according to what it's supposed to be. Mostly left satisfied, although some people didn't like the movie. But what did they expect? Polanski is Polanski, not a dollar that everyone likes.<br />  The Ninth Gate did not impress me very much but I still enjoyed it. I pictured it as a prank and not an attempt to uncover some secrets. Some of ideas in the movie are great, especially the moment when Boris attempts to summon the Devil (this moment reminded me of the movie Hudson Haw). Yes, there are weak points to the movie, but I only noticed them after reading critics. For example, you can see bad screen work especially when there is a bike ride - the movie wouldn't lose anything without that scene and still you can see that Dean and the Girl are just shaking and not actually driving but my views don't mean that mystic-lovers won't find anything for themselves in The Ninth Gate. As a matter offact there are some analogies with Angel Heart.<br />  Should you watch The Ninth Gate? Yeah, why not? It won't leave anyone indifferent and plus, it is better than Oprah at the very least.den a big fuss starts around Dean and the books where he's being targeted, other owner's getting killed, some green-eye Girl ( Roman Polanski's wife  Emmanuelle Seigner) who is part-time guardian-angel whose identity of intentions remain secret.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I already owned the DVDs for Firefly (and Serenity), but bought this Blu-ray version to see what the picture would look like. I won't comment on the series because like everyone else, I loved it and wish it was still on. But you either like it or don't. As for the Blu-ray, it is amazing. Picture clarity is improved and the space shots are tremendous (yes I know they are not real space shots but special effects). I can't add much to all the other comments except to say that the Blu-ray definitely enhances the experience of watching Firefly all over again.
B003HC8I5M|3.0|This is Phil Collins's new CD release titled \\"Going Back\\" : it's a collection of his interpretation/covers of 18 Motown and 60's soul classics. There was 'some controversy/rumour' in Europe a few weeks ago that Phil Collins is releasing this new CD to help him finance his recent divorce settlement for his ex-wife, but in a recent interview Phil Collins refutes this allegation : he says he has enough money left even after his divorce settlement & that he therefore doesn't need the money and hence a big chunk of this album sales/proceeds will be going to charity!    This is his first CD release since 2002's \\"Testify\\" album : which had predominantly new material & better album overall than this CD. This new CD, \\"Going Back\\" is rather 'ordinary' at best but has a solid/excellent title track/my favourite, \\"Going Back\\" : typical Phil Collins's sound (his interpretation of Gerry Goffin & Carole King's classic), this song is rich in sound, music & vocals! A good choice for the title of this album, but one wishes if there were more songs of similar or better calibre/interpretation in this CD. Other notable tracks include, \\"Some Of Your Lovin'\\" (another Gerry Goffin & Carole King classic), \\"Blame It On The Sun\\" (a Steve Wonder classic), \\"Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\\" (another Steve Wonder & Ivy Jo Hunter classic), \\"Talking About My Baby\\" (a Curtis Mayfield classic), \\"Jimmy Mack\\" (a Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier & Edward Hollard Jr. Classic) & \\"Papa Was A Rolling Stone\\" (has great lead guitar playing, a classic by Norman J. Whitfield & Barrett Strong). The CD is predominated by songs by Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Norman J. Whitfield & Edward Holland Jr.[Nine songs], Steve Wonder [Four songs], Gerry Goffin & Carole King [Two songs]. The overall package of this CD, produced by Phil Collins himself, played by musicians Bob Babbitt (bass), Eddie Willis (guitar), Ray Monette (guitar) & Phil Collins (drums, piano, bass, percussion, glockenspiel, harp, keyboards, guitar, organ,vocals & backing vocals) is a rather not so great effort by Phil Collins in interpreting soul & 60's classics (certainly not at his best)! He has done better with covers before, e.g. \\"Two Hearts\\", \\"A Groovy Kind Of Love\\", \\"True Colors\\", \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\", \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\", \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" & many others/more with amazing/better results. The overall rating of this CD \\" Going Back\\" is 3 stars. It has sparks here & there but these are not enough to lift this CD beyond 3 stars. Phil Collins with his talent, experience & insight can certainly produce/release a better product!
0789318245|5.0|This is a great book. It's that simple. If you're at all interested in classic or vintage tattoos then let this be your first book on the subject, or if you have other tattoo topic books, then you need to add this to that collection.    I was interested in a book on old school or vintage tattoos. My main purpose was to learn a little bit more about Sailor Jerry Collins and his influences. I thought maybe there would be some other interesting tidbits of information on the history of what we now consider \\"vintage tattoos\\" and maybe some cool pictures - what I got was an amazing surprise.    There is so much fantastic and detailed information - none of it boring. The book takes you on an incredible journey through time, style, artists and even equipment.    Even if you don't know how to read, the pictures and old flash of these vintage tattoos are worth the price of admission ... ok, the price of the book, but you get the point.    Whether you're looking for tattoo ideas, a tattoo history lesson or want to have a unique perspective on vintage tattoos - this is a must add to your bookshelf.

As a startup guy and salesperson, I found the ideas and examples presented in \\"Drive\\" powerful, radical, and timely. Businesses that can put in place the findings that behavioral science has accepted as fact will benefit tremendously from Dan Pink's Drive.

044656740X|3.0|This book kick started my interested in controlling your own finance but I realize something is amiss when I finished the book, I am lost. I do not know what's the next step to take.    Luckily for me, I noted down one of the books he mentioned, The richest man in babylon and went to amazon and bought the book. It took me a while before I start reading. Meanwhile, still searching my way to finance success and bought many books which either reinforce his idea or contain really complicated stuff for my still young financial mind. My effort up until then have been much of a waste if not provides little.    Until I read The richest man in babylon, everything make sense.    Robert Kiyosaki failed to consider that his reader are going to be in all kind of financial situation. Young graduate, debt ridden people, financially strained family, long hour working middle class or even the truly rich. But to stir their feeling up and make them take dangerous steps into financial and investment without a good plan is why I took 2 stars away from this book. These step can worsen people situation. Tell people there's a bargain for a certain property and fail to teach them how to locate one is particularly dangerous. There's risk in investing and Robert Kiyosaki might have advocated some of his reader to take too much risk.    In today world where these financial means are available to the general public, authors of financial books have to be more responsible in their use of words.    For people who mind has been open up, I want to reinforce that the learning has just started.    Read The richest man in babylon, where this classic tackle almost (if not all) of the financial situation and teach you how to get out of it. It will reshape your concept and mindset about money and how to earn, spend, save, grow, protect and repay to their rightful owner, freeing you from the grip of money along the way.    As of investment, I suggest start understanding the different type of investment.The major investment type is debt or asset based. Value and growth investing versus speculative trading.    Read The Intelligent Investors and Common Stocks and Uncommon profits can give you great inside on value and grow investing. I do a little of speculative trading which I haven't find a good book about it but if you are into technical analysis, New concept of technical trading system is an excellent book.    I'm not into debt type of investment so I can't recommend on that. Check out investopedia and learn more about investment and discover your own investment strategy along the way.    I'm still on my way to financial freedom and only time will tell if I am discipline enough to ripe the rewards from what I learn and whether these classic book continue to prove timeless.    Wish me luck and I wish everyone luck too.

1416550534|4.0|Ninety-nine year old Grace is in a nursing home when she is visited by a young director who is making a film about a reported suicide that occurred in the summer of 1924 at a party at Riverton House.   The visit sparks Grace's memories of that time.  For years, Grace has kept a secret about what really happened the night of the party and the events that led up to the death.      The story is told from Grace's perspective.  At fourteen, Grace begins working as a servant for the Hartford family at Riverton House.  She feels a kinship with the family's children; seventeen-year-old David, fourteen-year-old Hannah, and nine-year-old Emmeline.   We follow the family as the children grow up and are forced to deal first with World War I and then the societal restrictions of 1920s Britain.      As in Morton's second novel, The Forgotten Garden, The House at Riverton focuses on family secrets and alliances, and how those secrets impact the choices and circumstances of both those who have knowledge of the secret and those who don't.   The novel is also a fascinating exploration of the early twenty-first century British society and the relationship between the upper and working class.      The book was engrossing.  Although I found myself eager to learn the mystery at the heart of the book, the relationships between all of the characters intrigued me and I enjoyed the way in which Morton took time to explore them.  There were a couple of male characters that I never completely understood and that I think could have been better drawn.   Despite that flaw, I found the book riveting in its exploration of how secrets, those both known and unknown, inform an individual's sense of self.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|After I got the disappointing Carlos Santana last week, I was nervous about getting the new Eric Clapton, I needn't worry!  Clapton's new album simply called \\"Clapton\\", is a trip back in time, this really surprised me how good this is after the lackluster efforts for most of the past decade. (best since \\"Riding With The King\\").  Good tracks here include, \\"Travelin' Alone\\", \\"Hard Time Blues\\", \\"My Very Good Friend The Milkman\\", \\"Judgement Day\\" and \\"Run Back To Your Side\\".  This might be old school, but Eric is back home here!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a fun game.  The first time you play it, it is confussing.  Now that we know what we are doing, it is fun.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|This probably the last time I will purchase a book from \\"Oprah's Book Club\\"  The first book that I read that she recommended turned out to be Fiction when it was suppose to be Non-fiction and this book \\"Freedom\\" is one of the most boring books I have ever tried to read.    I'm an avid reader of all types of books and I can honestly say this book was a complete and total waste of my time and money.  The story just rambles on and on about nothing.    I usually finish a book to the end, especially when I pay $12.99 for it, but this story was not worth the effort it took.  I have very limited time to read, so I want the story to be engrossing, again this was just plain boring.
0312600844|4.0|I basically agree with the many other reviews that lament the one-dimensional characters, stilted dialogue, and unnecessary plot contrivances (i.e. Patty's autobiography written in third-person), but I still couldn't put this book down. I enjoyed reading it even if it's not the greatest novel ever written!
B002NWRMVS|3.0|Wow, what a lackluster performance. I expected so much better from Norah Jones. Half of the songs featured here will put you to sleep. It's OK, but nowhere near what she is capable of. Only for die-hard fans.
B003HC8I5M|5.0|Yup--five stars.  Surprises me, too.  I can't stop listening to this album.  I'm a long time fan of Phil, Pete and Genesis, and when I first heard of this, I was disappointed.  But, it really takes me back to Phil's first two albums--there's such energy and spark in the whole thing, the songs are all wonderful, the playing is fantastic--and the production tries to mimic each song's original production.  That scared me when I first heard it would be done that way, but this is wholly successful, and yes, while I have most of the original versions of these songs, this album does them all justice and I enjoy them just as much!  It's so cool to have The Funk Brothers as the band on this--I kinda assumed maybe they'd be playing here and there, but with Phil's usual band--but, nope--they're the real deal and make up THE core band on this!  And, Phil's drumming is fantastic--who knew?!  Overall, this is a wonderful surprise, and since I got mine a couple weeks ago, I've not wanted to stop listening.  LOVE it!  \\"Going Back\\" and \\"Blame It On the Sun\\" are moving highlights.    So, at first skeptical, I'm now very glad to have this great memento, not only to Motown's past, but also to Phil's.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I highly recommend this movie. It was well done and the story is simply beautiful, yet gut-wrenching to animal lovers like myself.
0316017922|5.0|This is a nice book to read and learn that many things we know is not as seen.
0316044695|5.0|Great book by a true Texan and part of a group of legends.  The love for his country is only outdone by his love of God and family.  Great detail about training and battle.  I highly recomend this book.
B0044430H8|5.0|if you appreciate all that trent reznor has done (whether it's nine inch nails or how to destroy angels or the side projects he's done for numerous movie soundtracks and video games), you will love this! reminiscent of his 4-part \\"ghosts\\" album with nine inch nails collaborator atticus ross... this beautifully melodic soundtrack sets the mood and tone for what essentially is, a david fincher film.
0321344758|5.0|This book collects a body of common sense and real-world reality to the web-design world.  In an environment where there is a temptation to create a better shaped wheel, it's refreshing to have an author remind us that wheels are round for a reason.
B00005JLZN|1.0|In the 1800s, this story would have clearly been called \\"a humbug\\", which today means a fraud.  This movie is one long fraud, and a really preachy one at that. A complete waste of my time. The makers of this movie probably don't realize that they just come across as preachy, liberal Hollywood types telling everybody else to become enlightened.     As with other reviewers, I agree that if you want to see a thoughtful film that examines the death penalty, buy \\"Dead Man Walking\\" with Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon - now that's a film worth watching.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|19.99 for an ebook is outrageous. The book is not that great.  They can keep it.
B003HKN52A|4.0|This is the release from the movie limited engagement in Aug and Sept 2010. Elvis on Tour is over 90 min long and shows behind the sceens never released before. Some interesting, some funny. Overall, it is a must for any collector. I enjoyed it with 25 songs from his different concerts.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|A must have if you own the Plantronics Voyager Pro!  Small, Convenient, Durable, Protective, and it has a good strong belt clip!
0316098337|4.0|I purchased this book based on recommendations and reviews.  I was hooked from the first page.  What makes the book so relevant and believable are the stories of real people on the news who have suffered experiences similar to Jack and his Ma.  The author developed the characters with emotion and feeling, but managed to stay away from self pity.  I felt myself thinking about Jack long after I had finished the book.  The story haunted me. That, in my opinion, is the definition of a good read.
0765350386|5.0|What can be said that has not already been stated about this book. While this is Sanderson's second novel and the first in the Mistborn trilogy, it is definitely one of the better in the series. As soon as the book starts there is a great tension that just grabs you and does not let go throughout the rest of the book. I stated that this book had a great magic system, and that was no joke. The magic system is by far one of the best qualities of the novel, and I don't want to spoil it so I'll let you find that out for yourself. The plot too, was great and had the other two novels not come out this would have been a great stand-alone like Elantris. In the end to all fantasy readers looking for a fresh book to dive into, there is no better novel than Mistborn!
B003HC8I5M|1.0|The best that can be said for this album is that it contains competent covers. That is not really a compliment for someone with the career of Phil Collins. There is really nothing added to or changed from the arrangements of the originals. None of the songs are the equal of the originals and most are far worse.<br /><br />It is sad to see this happen to artists like Phil Collins. However, to be fair, his career has been on the decline for some time. I can only imagine his people telling him that noone wants his original music anymore but there is always a market for folks his age returning to the music of their childhood.<br /><br />So Phil has joined James Taylor, Rod Stewart et al for what I would call their \\"off to the retirement home album\\". Good luck, Phil - we'll miss you.
B000E41MS6|4.0|One of the greatest TV shows on. The new invigorated Doctor Who is even better than the original. Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper do a fantastic job facing off against Daleks, The Gelf, The Slathene, and the many other fantastic creatures they encounter. Absolutely recommended for both the hardcore and casual fan.
1592289444|5.0|One of the most heroic stories of our times. The fugitives of Russian Gulag 303 in Siberia never gave in to their Soviet oppressors. Not during the lenghty torture and interrogations, not through the standing room only train ride in animal cars, not through the laborious walk through snow covered vast lands of Siberia. They always kept their God given rights of Freedom and Liberty and pursued their own destiny despite their terrible situation. A true inspiration to all and tribute to numerous un-known heroes who suffered during WWII.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|When is Robert Plant going to cut loose & record a rock album?? I've had enough of this slow, lumbering, twangy, music that for some reason he seems obsessed with. It's been way to long since he has released a energetic, full out rock album. This new release is o.k. But, it's just more of the same stuff we've heard from him on his last 2 projects. Enough already!!! It's time for Plant to get back to true rock and roll!!!
0316098337|5.0|\\"Today I'm five. I was four last night going to sleep in Wardrobe, but when I wake up in Bed in the dark I'm changed to five, abracadabra. Before that I was three, then two, then one, then zero. \\"Was I minus numbers?\\"    To Jack, whom we know is now five, Room is his whole world and his only world. Jack has never been Outside, never felt the sun on his face or the breezes blow his hair.  We quickly learn Jack and his \\"Ma\\" are being held captive in a 12 by 12 foot gardener's shack that's been outfitted with electricity, plumbing and basic furniture.  Jack is the storyteller and we learn about his world through his innocent eyes. We learn that \\"Ma\\" was abducted from her college campus seven years ago at the age of nineteen. We know Jack is her child by their kidnapper, whom they call \\"Old Nick\\" because he visits in the night. Now that Jack is five, his mother decides they must try to escape.    \\"Room\\" was brilliantly penned by Dublin born novelist Emma Donoghue, who wisely chose to tell this story from the viewpoint of a child. By doing that, there is no ability to describe their captivity as anything other than the norm. Jack knows no other existence.  Donoghue's writing captures the essence of the five year old Jack, whose only conversations have been with his mother. He has no reference to other children, no clue about what he is missing, or that his way of life is anything but normal.   Donoghue has woven a believable way of life for mother and child in this trapped situation with the mother doing her best to educate, nourish and keep her child strong through games and homemade toys. While I had a little issue with the ease of their escape, it helped move the story forward quickly.      I was unwilling to put this book down, except when I absolutely had to.  I finished \\"Room\\" in a day and a half. Hypnotic, compelling, spellbinding and fascinating, I highly recommend this book. It's not always easy to read.  The emotional tidal waves created by Donoghue rip into your heart and soul.   However, the stunningly believable ending makes the anguish worth while. IF I gave a star rating (but I don't), I'd give it 5 out of 5 stars.
B003U0AHBO|1.0|I haven't laughed at a film so much in years!  Granted the first half is a bit flat but then the whole thing really picks up in quality.      The carefully interwoven references to other films are genius.  The beach landing scene is straight out of Saving Private Ryan (complete with Medieval Landing Craft and underwater shots of Frenchmen getting shot with arrows), there is a bit of Braveheart in there too.  And then Maid Marion turns up on the battlefield disguised as a knight in a suit of armour, straight out of Lord of the Rings.  Presumably the fight on the beach was inspired by Quodrophenia.  They missed a trick though, the final scene of Monty Python's Holy Grail would have crowned the entire epic had it been used, a couple of coppers turning up to arrest the naughty kerniggots.  Don't miss this wonderful rollercoaster through Medieval legend (or is that a steam train)?      Note to producers, its highly unlikely that anyone could get to Dungeness from Nottingham and fight a battle in a couple of days (forget Harold's epic march from Stamford Bridge - the one up North, not in West London).  Its probably at elast 150 miles. And Kent must have changed quite a bit since the 1200s.  Those white cliffs at Dungeness seemed to have now eroded into a shingle beach.  Surely they could have used the real Dungeness and disguised the nuclear power station as a castle?        Well done to the person who wrote the musical score, the bit where Russel Crowe remembers his hitherto forgotten childhood, I wouldn't have realised that I was supposed to get all emotional without those sobbing violins.  I quite expected a bit of Bryan Adams too but you can't have everything.  At least they all lived happily ever after and King John turned out to be a right villain after all.    Pile of poop.  The one with Costner in it was better than this.  Good grief, did I just write that?  Bring back Errol Flynn and his green tights or get that other one from 1991 with Uma Thurman in it.
0891419063|5.0|Only Eugene Sledge can tell this story properly, a story that came in a small pocket-sized book for further reading when you're on the go, and is in excellent condition! I was impressed with the story told of a young Marine as he describes his training in the Corps and the bitter combat that followed as he served his country and drove away the menacing hordes that threatened it from the beginning. Go, Marine Corps! Sledge rocks the house with this story.
0312383436|3.0|I picked up this book for a good \\"chick lit\\" read as I have read all of Sophie Kinsella's and Madeline Wickham's books, so I thought this one would be a good read.  I enjoyed the book until the last quarter of it, where new plot lines were suddenly thrown in.  The story line between Harry and Isobel is unnecessary and incomplete and Esme shouldn't be in the book at all (what was between her and Harry, it's never mentioned).  I would recommend reading this book if you can borrow it from a friend but I would not pay full price for this book.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|never receive this item but the movie was great. they did refund me my purchase.
1591396190|1.0|The book I purchased was supposed to be new, but it was not new and had highlighting in it which means someone else used the book.  I have written twice complaining to the seller and Amazon that I want a used sales price and to be reimbursed the difference, but nobody has responded.  This is very poor customer service!!!

B002ZG9968|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was funny and light, and my husband and I both watched it.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|This is an all time great movie. It has just the right amount of action, suspense, drama & danger. This is one movie you dont forget and you can tell people about it with excitement.
0545265355|5.0|Awesome books. Can't put them down. Keeps you interested from the 1st book to the last.

B001V7YWTQ|5.0|\\"Blind Faith\\" with \\"Well Alright\\" on it, was released less than 11 years after Buddy Holly's original. It seemed like a lifetime between. Now the reunion, 40 years later, seems like a few minutes later.
B002HFWAXG|5.0|The disc is not 1080p. It's 1080i. But you can upconvert it to 1080p and the pic looks great. I could easily tell the difference when A/B-ing between interlaced and progressive, but the progressive looked as good as if the disc was 1080p because the progressive upconversion just adds more lines to an already great interlaced resolution.    In case you are questioning my observation/expertise, I am a lifelong video/audiophile and my comparisions of the above were observed on a Pioneer 60\\" Kuro Plasma set.    The audio is DTS Master Audio 5.1, but you will have to set the audio to this format because the disc doesn't default to the highest audio rez.    Also, if your Blu-ray player is set to auto, it may default to 1080i, as mine did, so you will have to manually set your player to 1080p. As I noted above, there is a big picture difference between the two video resolutions.    Outside of set up issues, you will probably not be able to tell the difference between the Canadian release and the upcoming US release.    Only the set up hassles are different.    Did I say the price is right?    Oh, as for MovieMars, you may not get a reply, but I just ordered the movie and they sent it to me in a reasonable amount of time. No problems.    You want your stupid questions answered for $10 buck. Give me a break!
0783233477|5.0|I've watched a lot of movies in my time and especially watched the career of Brad Pitt.  If you want to see one of the most intriguing  -- and most likely -- difficult roles he's ever performed, watch this movie.  It is funny, surprising, compassionate, angry and moving.  I've seen it at least a dozen times and it gets me everytime.      I think this movie is a great idea and perspective on life and the possibility of living our last days in a totally different way.  I would totally act like Anthony Hopkins and wouldn't be as prepared as he seemed to be, but would very much welcome someone to accompany me when its time for me to go.    Acted with stunning originality, Pitt delivers, and so does the rest of the cast.  I love the reference to peanut butter and am still amazed at the exchange between Mr. Black and the lady in the hospital. I also feel it could have moved just a bit faster in some scenes, but if that is its only detraction, then I still think its one of the best movies around.
0739319175|3.0|Parts of this book were quite creative and held out great promise, most of which unfortunately was never developed. Noetics? Given that this potentially fascinating tool/threat was flatly acknowledged as not yet ready to be shared and was never put to use, most of explorations into the topic felt like vast and unnecessary asides rather than an active part of the plot. There were also glaring plot holes - strange choices by smart characters that should have known better, long sections of lecturing and academic games between supposedly traumatized and exhausted characters, and an underwhelming conclusion. It was worth reading for many of the interesting historical asides and unusual ideas, but it won't be making my personal collection of keepers.
B000EZ913I|4.0|Being a huge Byrds fan and a huge Mobile Fidelity fan, purchasing this release was a no-brainer for me.  It sounds really good and is one of the best releases by the Byrds, in my opinion.  The songs flow together quite seamlessly and there is not a clunker in the whole set.    My only gripe is having the original album released in mono, as others have mentioned.  It would not have made much of a difference to me, but the bonus tracks are in stereo, so one hears what could have been.  The best example I can give is \\"Draft Morning\\".  The mono version sounds good, but the sound is somewhat shallow and claustrophobic.   The listener really hears the track come alive when listening to the stereo bonus track of \\"Draft Morning\\".  The differences are striking in terms of soundstage and instrument separation.  The bonus track of \\"Draft Morning\\" is an alternate version, but not much different from the official album cut in terms of actual content.    Regardless, this MOFI release is worth picking up if you are a Byrds fan.  However, it would have been perfect had MOFI used the stereo mix for the entire release.
1440503257|5.0|Excellent!! This is the book I have been waiting for since first picking up a Harry Potter book. Food is such an important part of the Harry Potter stories and deserves it's own book! Thank you for taking the time to research and create this wonderful volume; I have added it to my Harry Potter collection!
B003XX2PD6|5.0|I have been hooked to this album for sometime. Brad Cox songwriting is reaching new heights with diverse takes on 60's psychedelia and 70's glam rock. My favorite songs are Revival with its gorgeous hooks and Coronado which gets down and dirty. Please buy this album, you won't regret it.
0451228375|4.0|A good read. Maybe it suffers a little with the plot similarities with his Pillars of the Earth.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers have finally reached deep into their collective musical sould and have pulled out a brilliant piece of blues rock.
1607886278|3.0|Just a warning to anyone who is considering purchasing the audio version of this book. This novel is primaily narrated by a five-year old. And for some inexplicable reason the producers of the audiobook thought that it would be a good idea to have it actually narrated by a child's voice. Not just any child's voice...a squeaky voice that sounds like a Saturday morning cartoon, or like an adult's voice that has been manipulated to sound like a child. The result is absolutely horrid...unlistenable.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|If you have read Sanderson before, you know to expect excellent characters, an inventive magic system which complements rather than overshadows the characters, and an engaging story.    This book delivers a fantastic reading experience on so many levels it is hard to know where to begin.  Sanderson's knack for telling a desperate but triumphant story certainly shines through in The Way of Kings.  For every jaw-droppingly cool concept explained, there are a half dozen tantalizing mysteries left for later books to explore.  Despite the ongoing story arc, there is excellent resolution of some of he major threads and conflicts in the book.  For every twist or stunner one comes across - and there are a few! - others are foreshadowed.      This book puts Sanderson in serious contention for my favorite fantasy author of all time - and I have read a large breadth of extant fantasy over the last 4 decades.      One of the final blessings of this book is value.  This book could have easily been a trilogy.  You pay one time for content that might have been charged for 3 times.  At no point does this story drag; you simply read it with joy at how much you still have yet to read.  The size of this book is not due to lazy editing; there is just so much high end, tight content that it is surprising and gratifying as a consumer.      As a final thank you to Tor and Mr. Sanderson, thanks for leaving Text-to-Speech on for the Kindle.  I didn't use it for this book, but I am always appreciative that you wish to distinguish yourselves from the stingy publishers that block this feature.  I preferentially buy from publishers that do not disable this feature.    This book is a tour de force.  Whether this is your first Sanderson book or you have read all of his prior works, I give this work my highest recommendation and envy you for the new experience of reading it.
0451209338|4.0|The Kill Artist follows Gabriel Allon who is a former Mossad agent on a mission to takedown known terrorist Tariq. Since others have gone into more detail about the plot and characters, I'll leave that to them.<br /><br />As a reader of David Baldacci, Brad Thor and Vince Flynn, I find this novel to be near the top of the genre of spy/espionge/thriller novels. Garbiel Allon is not as dark, gritty and as violent as Mitch Rapp from Vince Flynn's novels but I would say he's more cunning. I would also say that Silva's writting style is more technical and refined than Flynn's, as it the plotting. Still, The Kill Artist isn't action packed like the Mitch Rapp and Horvath novels but it makes up for it with plots and subplots that always keep you intersted and wondering what twist will come next.<br /><br />The Kill Artist is much more of straight forward story than the next novel in the series [[ASIN:0451208188 The English Assassin]] but still very good. Well worth the read if you like any of the above mentioned authors.
0571238343|5.0|This great book is really what it says: a real animator survival kit. The book start from the basics with great refferences, animation examples and its story from the very beginning. This expanded edition is even better, with a lot of new pages and more animation sketches. Recommend to any animator, even juniors and pros, because the book is a real masterpiece.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|I recently purchased the DVD box set containing the original \\"Karate Kid\\" movies and had the pleasure of watching them with my 2 boys, who are 14 and 13 years old.  So naturally, when the 2010 version came to the big screen, I had to take them to see it.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />There's a reason this 2010 version of \\"The Karate Kid\\" has racked in nearly $180 million worldwide--it's even better than the original.<br /><br />I have to respectfully disagree with a few of the reviewers who state this movie is not as good as, or similar enough to, the original: while parts of this rendition are different than 1984's version (the 2010 movie takes place in China and kung fu is practiced versus karate), the key thematic element is the same (a boy struggles and then ultimately succeeds in finding his inner--and outer--strength with the help of a wise mentor).  Thus, the remake is justified and it is a success.<br /><br />The four key players do an exemplary job: Jaden Smith, aka Dre, in the title role; Jackie Chan as Mr Han; Zhenwei Wang as Cheng, the bully; and Wenwen Han as Meiying, the pretty young Chinese girl who captures Dre's heart.  Jaden Smith does an excellent job at balancing the energy and emotion of his young character, while Jackie Chan succeeds with flying colors in acting as the Yoda-type teacher, and does so in a serious, subtle style rarely seen in his other movies.<br /><br />The script perfectly leverages action and emotion, the fighting scenes are well choreographed, and the camerawork and direction are fanstastic.<br /><br />Bottom line: \\"Jacket on! Jacket off!\\"
0486274268|5.0|The book is a real masterpiece. The drawings are great refference to any artist, and includes even some animation. Recomend to any animal artist or creature designer.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I watched this series as they first became available (streaming through Netflix).    Each episode just got better.    Gore, sex, and good drama. It doesn't get any better than that.    I beg that there be a season 2. And soon.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|Is this a lost album from the 70's? It sure as hell sounds like<br />one of the great hard rock bands like Deep Purple, Trapeze, Zep<br />& others! Wow! Maybe finally Glenn Hughes will get the attention<br />he deserves for being one of the greatest singers/bassist/song<br />writers in rock history! British guitarist Jon Bonamassa is<br />not only brilliant on guitar his vocals are also incredible.<br />He should have more attention then MTV prettyboy blues faker<br />over rated Mayer. Jason Bonham [UFO/Foreigner] on drums is<br />as good as his dad John Bonham from Zeppelin & plays with<br />the thunder and rhythm of his father. Keyboards played very<br />much like Deep Purple is Derek Sherinian which I'm not at<br />all familiar with but fits very well. The songs are just<br />classic hard rock sounding but better than say \\"Chickenfoot\\"<br />overblown supergroup. Songs like Black Country, Great Divine,<br />Beggerman & Revolution in me really show the great songwriting.<br />The masterpiece is the 8 minute Song of Yesterday which I think<br />if released in 70's would have been big as Stairway to Heaven.<br />It's that good. This album should get massive radio airplay if<br />things in Rock & Roll were fair but so often great bands &<br />albums never get the credit while others [Mayer, Chickenfoot]<br />get too much! The best rock album in years!
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Not my favorite Beatles album - actually about 5th behind White Album, Revolver, Rubber Soul and Help.  Maybe it's because there is not enough Lennon in it, maybe it's because I've heard some of these songs so much (like the Harrison tunes), or maybe it's because it has \\"Octopus's Garden\\".  However, there is no doubt this is a great piece of work and the remaster seems to have hit just the right tone.  A little richer sound with more bass and a little higher volume, but treble is not so enhanced as to hurt the ears like many remasters.      Here are some random observations that may be useful:    For those who like to mix Beatles songs from all the albums or with other bands and like some of the songs on the \\"The End\\" medley but maybe don't want the entire Medley (I know this is sacrilege to some), the breaks between songs are perfect - there is no nagging millisecond of the previous song being part of the beginning of the next song like the 1987 CD had (check out the beginning of \\"Polythene Pam\\" and \\"The End\\" on the two versions for example).  Thus, each song in the medley, if lifted separately into a mix at least has a clean beginning.  I especially wanted this for the song \\"The End\\".     Come Together - Increased bass, makes a tough sounding song even tougher.  To me this song paved the way for all the blues rock bands of the 70's.  The intro of the guitar at 1:10 is the template for guitar rock for the next 20 years!!     Maxwell Silver Hammer - I can hear stuff in this song I've not heard before.  Totally increases my appreciation for this tune that I have always blown off as a joke.  The richer sound really improves this song and the Moog can be heard in much greater detail.    Something/Here Comes the Sun - Perhaps my favorite Beatles song is Harrison's \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" on the White album but the two Harrison songs on this album just don't do it for me.  Everyone I know thinks they are great but I think I've just heard them too much.  I will saythat the drums and bass on \\"Something\\" sound much better here and add more interest to this song.  I wish they had increased the volume of the acoustic guitar at the beginning of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" which I always thought was too quiet.  The strings, drums and bass kick in with much more gusto than before however and I seem to really notice the strings more than before.  Really meaty - thank you George Martin!!    I Want You - When I first bought this album in 1969, this song sounded like extended junk to me and not a real song.  Now it sounds absolutely fantastic on the remaster.  The abrupt ending, similar to the later song \\"Hellbound Train\\" by Savoy Brown is perfect.  Give this another listen - like Come Together this provided a template for much of heavy rock in the 70's and 80's.  Probably the biggest surprise on the remaster for me.        Because - The Moog really pops out here, sounding like a Walter (Wendy) Carlos concert!!    You Never Give Me Your Money - I don't care that much for Paul's songs but if ever a song epitomized the style and moods of Paul it is this one - the bells are truly astonishing here and Paul's singing actually gave me chills.  Don't like parts of the original mix with drums way over to the right, however (but that's not the fault of the remaster and I'm glad they didn't remix).    Sun King - I actually think the bass is enhanced too much on this song - it seems a little distorted in spots.     Mean Mr. Mustard - A punky song by Lennon that is the sleeper of the album.  Wow - bass on the left is really cranked but it works here.  Love this little one minute song and the next...      Polythene Pam - Opening guitar riff jumps out of the speakers - sounds great!!!  Drums are mixed great and seem to hear a cowbell (or something like that) a little more clearly.    Bathroom Window - Guitar work is like a hot knife through butter. Perfect.  I assume this is George.    Golden Slumbers - great bass but wish the drums had been originally mixed more in the middle like \\"The End\\" instead of off to the far left.  This is not the fault of the remastering but the original mix.  However, I always though that the drum intro at 0:32 should have dominated the mix like Phil Collins \\"In the Air Tonight\\" recorded in 1981.    The End - the first guitar riff after the drum solo (at 0:35) slides down a fret for a split second like I've never noticed before. Very cool!  The cymbals are less prominent after the drum solo.
0739370642|5.0|I've recently become addicted to audio books as my relationship with a man that lives over an hour away in rush hour traffic has become more serious (ie. I drive down there a lot).  This CD set doesn't disappoint as the story is incredibly compelling and the narration is equally impressive.  One of the things I enjoy about audio books (besides taking my mind off the incessant brake/gas/brake motions) is hearing the correct intonations and pronunciation of names, places, etc.  Since the story is set in Sweden, there are all sorts of proper nouns I would have butchered in my head.  But beyond the correctness of the text, the narrator does a fantastic job of telling a story which is sure to keep the listener enthralled.  A high recommendation for commuters and international travelers alike.
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|In many ways, DEVIL is simply a bloated episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE or ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS.  It could easily have been told in a 60 minute TV episode (including commercials).  Apparently this tale \\"sprung\\" from the mind of M. Night Shyamalan...and I like the inclination to tell little scary \\"short stories\\" via a film series.  However, I think I might like the idea even better if this became, let's say, an hour long series on Showtime.  DEVIL is so modest in scale and ambition that it felt a little like a rip-off to pay movie theater prices to see it.      DEVIL tells the story of five people who become trapped together in an elevator in a high-rise building in Philadelphia.  And it tells how all efforts to save them prove fruitless (and even fatal).  As the police get involved, it becomes evident that something supernatural is causing all this.  One by one, the passengers meet terrible ends.  (It almost feels like a claustrophobic, modern-day version of Agatha Christie's novel AND THEN THERE WERE NONE.)    The movie moves along at a brisk pace, but a lot of the action feels unneeded.  The role of the main detective (Chris Messina) is practically unneeded...except for the final couple of scenes.  He's the single biggest character, yet he's fairly tangential to most of what is going on.      The film has been marketed as a horror story, and the title certainly feeds that.  What's more horrible than The Devil, after all?  And yet, partially because it's PG-13 and thus shies away from gore...it feels more like a supernatural mystery.     The film, directed by John Erick Dowdle, who also helmed QUARANTINE (a movie I liked, even though everyone else hated that it was a remake of a Spanish film), kept my interest, was modestly suspenseful and was respectably acted.  Simply put, it is competently put together...but no matter how well it may have been done, the script/story are simply too skimpy.  The film has a couple of twists...but they don't begin to approach thegame-changing impact of THE SIXTH SENSE.  It is not fair to expect every movie with a twist to knock us out like SENSE...but in DEVIL, the little twists made me think, \\"wow, this ENTIRE movie has been made just to get to this minor surprise.  So much work for SO little payoff.\\"    I give the film a VERY modest thumbs up...but only if you're seeing a bargain showing, or better yet, watching it on DVD in your darkened living room.  I think that will bring this to the proper scale.  (And I say again...Shyamalan, please think about bringing these modest efforts to the small screen.)
B003ZK58WM|1.0|The publisher, Dutton Adult, sets the ebook price. The fact that the ebook price is more expensive than the hardcover is a blatant attempt by Dutton to create a chilling affect on ebook sales so they can protect their network of book distributors. It's evil. Things change and Dutton needs to get on board.<br /><br />If we all use the power of the product review to make the cost of over charging for ebooks to expensive of a proposition, maybe they'll sell their e-products at a reasonable price.
B003ODL004|4.0|Zimmer the film composer analogous to the Spice Girls as a guilty pleasure in pop - but it's great!,<br />I can't believe how good an audio experience this soundtrack makes based on practically a couple of three of four note themes throughout! Zimmer is a god.<br />By far the best tracks are \\"Dream Is Collapsing\\" & \\"Mombasa\\", as they provide fresh alternatives to the thematic sequences as well as new sub themes. They're also relatively upbeat and demanding to listen to compared to the rest of the slow developing cues.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it tends to get a little repetitive; while still beautiful, tracks like \\"Radical Notion\\" and \\"Old Souls\\" tend to drag on with the same thing again and again...<br /><br />Other than that, one of the best film scores of the year so far. One of only a couple I've purchased. Far superior to Horner's Avatar.<br /><br />Four stars.<br /><br />N.B. Don't forget to grab yourself the 2 bonus tracks \\"Projections\\" & \\"Don't Think About Elephants\\" by signing up to the /inception movie (dot) warner bros (dot) com soundtrack mailing list!<br /><br />Additionally, the deep brass rhythm from the trailer music \\"Mind Heist\\" by Zack Hemsey is available to stream on his website. It's homaged in the opening of the film during \\"Half Remembered Dream\\" by Zimmer, who uses it succinctly to lead from the anticipation and into the depths of this astounding film, as well as at the end of \\"528491\\".
B003MZ0I84|5.0|If You Can Only Buy One Song: \\"Stutter,\\" \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed,\\" \\"How\\"<br /><br />I have never made this statement before, but here I go: Maroon 5 is the spiritual successor of The Beatles.  Yes, the sounds of different.  I don't make this claim lightly nor do I make this claim because they have a sound that reminds me of the greatest band of all time.  I say this because never before have I heard a contemporary band make so many popular hits while always challenging themselves musically.  I admit I wasn't completely won over with \\"Songs About Jane\\" but there were enough standout tracks to keep an eye on them.  Their follow-up album \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" was a masterpiece, instantly becoming a favorite of mine (minus one track that I leave off my iPod).<br /><br />Now we have \\"Hands All Over,\\" easily their most mainstream effort but still containing their unique sound.  Of course this probably helps when you team up with legendary producer Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lang, who I hear ordered more rewrites and retakes then any other producer the band had worked with.  The result?  Another album that has multiple single potential.  Heck, this may be the first album since Shania Twain's \\"Come On Over\\" (another Lang produced album) produced so many number one hits.  It opens with the catchy \\"Misery\\" and doesn't let up.  With tracks like \\"Stutter,\\" \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed,\\" and \\"How\\" are all lyrically poetic and musically catchy.  These are all radio friendly songs that have pretty deep lyrics for pop recordings.<br /><br />If there is a downside to the album it's the final track \\"Out of Goodbyes\\" with Lady Antebellum.  I guess it's a sweat enough track but it comes off as rather boring in comparison to the rest of the beat heavy tracks on the album.  For those with a couple extra bucks there is a deluxe edition that features some acoustic cuts and a new song \\"Last Chance,\\" which is the song the regular edition should have ended on instead.  But if this is the worst aspect of the album than I don't care.  This is a much needed relief after Katy Perry's \\"Teenage Dream\\" failed to really catch on with me.  Hopefully Lang will return to produce another Maroon 5 album sometime in the future.  He seems to really understand what they are about and how to make them accessible to the mainstream.  And despite what fans of indie music will claim that is not a bad thing.<br /><br />Grade: ***** starsn I don't care.

B0044430H8|5.0|There are two sides to every story. There's 'Broken' and there's 'Ghosts I-IV'. As already stated, this is reminiscent of 'Ghosts I-IV'. Why are you still reading this? If you're a fan of albums like 'Ghosts I-IV' and 'Still', this is for you. Are you still reading this review? Seriously, stop reading and download it already. Don't go try to find a torrent, don't go searching RS or HF, just buy it. Better yet, buy the CD or the blue-ray or the album (or all 3) when they're released too. If we don't support great arts such as this we're bound to lose them. Think about what is labeled \\"music\\" these days and then think of what Trent has provided us over the last 2 decades.

0316067938|1.0|While i never liked the Twilight saga much to begin with as books, i did enjoy the movies. The first three books have interesting story lines, but sometimes it can get distracting when bella goes on for pages and pages about how hot edward is. sometimes i would forget what i was reading about. this book though, it isnt distracting because of the pages and pages of descriptions. its distracting because it jumps from one event happening in the book to the next without any kind of transition or purpose for why it moves on to the next event.   *spoilers*    I can deal with the fact that bella had a baby (because i was expecting that to be honest.) and that she didnt have newborn urges. There is really nothing special about bella so smeyer had to make something unique about her. before the baby and the lack of newborn urges, the only special thing about bella was jacob and edward.  The stuff i cant really deal with (or give this review more stars) is the inconsistency and its useless suspense. Smeyer tries to explain how bella gets pregnant, it makes no sense to me. i tried asking this one girl i work with who loves this book and she cant explain to me how bella got pregnant with edwards child (because from my understanding from previous books vampires cant have children)either. Im already suspending disbelief by bella having a child. and if the author is asking me to accept this there has to be an explanation for this is being allowed. i can understand exceptions, but you need to have some kind of logic behind it for why it is. succubus? i dont understand what that has to do with vampires. i welcome any comments from anyone who can explain this to me.  the second thing that bothered me what the useless suspense. when bella find out something is wrong with her, it goes on and on about how she ate bad food. then for about three pages it describes on how shes looking into a box and shes shocked. so shocked she cant even speak. she cant put any thoughts together cause if this blue box. and then we find out its not a pregnancy test, but a box of tampons. (secondly why even mention that now? should that have been mentioned in twilight or something because it deals with blood? with all the times bella has spent with edwards family she never had a period? jasper goes crazy over a papercut but can resist blood from her menstrual cycle?) back to the haha suspense. now when i was reading certain parts where suspense was being built up, i was let down by how stupid they were resolved. why bother wasting my time if nothing is going to happen?   the last thing i will mention is the confusion in this book. there were so many characters that pretty much had no use other than to build up suspense i was trying to keep up with who they were and what their special talents were. that was stupid on my part because these talents from other vampires were not even used in the \\"epic\\" battle. i also find it weird that not many vampires have \\"talents\\" but everyone the cullens know do have special talents.  if you want to read this, prepare to be disappointed and bored.  p.s. when edward started talking to jazz and em, it took me a second to figure out who they were. when was jasper ever jazz and emmet ever em?
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have had my forefunner for about a year and a half.  It used to malfunction when I sweated, but this has stopped for the most part.  It wouldn't stop working/tracking, but the display would just go back to being a clock.  I find it very accurate for the most part.  The problems I have are when the weather is off - windy or foggy, etc.  When this happens, it has a hard time finding a satellite.  Once it finds one, I have no problems.  I don't use the heart rate monitor.  I found it annoying to put on the strap, etc.  If I have to buy a new one, I won't get one with the HRM.  I really like being able to upload my data to the Garmin site so I can view my runs or send them to my friends.  I'd be lost without my Garmin!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is an amazing series. It is \\"based\\" on the Terry Goodkind books. The series stands alone as an amazingly entertaining fantasy series! So many wonderful aspects that make the series a real winner. The actors Craig Horner, Bridget Regan, Craig Parker, Bruce Spencer and Tabrett Bethell are all really well cast. The storyline is thoroughly entertaining. The scenery is spectacular.  I enjoyed the first season immensely and the second season only gets better. I can't wait for my DVD to be delivered. Definitely worth a look!

B003OWVHVC|5.0|Aloe Blacc's CD was reccommended to me by Amazon and I'm glad for the pointer as I'd probably have missed this otherwise. I love his rich tenor voice.<br /><br />With a retro Soul sound remniscent of Curtis Mayfield or Marvin Gaye, his lyrics touch mainly on social issues. Opening cut is the groovy \\"I need a dollar\\" with darting horns, an insistent piano riff, and lyrics told from the view point of someone laid off. \\"Green lights\\" is organ-driven Soul, while the guitars in the funky \\"Hey brother\\" sound like they stepped out of Shaft.<br /><br />Other standouts are the lilting Reggae \\"Miss fortune\\", the falsetto-sung laid back \\"Life so hard\\" (with theatrical strings, a great echoing guitar solo, and lyrics touching on hunger, war and more), the breezy \\"Femme fatale\\", the bouncy \\"Loving you is killing me\\" (with nice layered harmonies), \\"If I\\" (\\"If I sang a song, would you sing with me / if I shed a tear, would you cry with me?\\"), and the Gospel-tinged \\"Momma hold my hand\\" (with autobiographical lyrics remniscing on his childhood).<br /><br />The production is light and free, perfect  for this uplifting CD. Highly reccommended!
0399156577|3.0|Before I start, I want to note that I am a rabid Nora Roberts  fan. Her books fill the top shelves of my bookcases. Most of them are amazing, but there are some where it seems like she either steps too far out of her depth, as was seen with her earlier supernatural books before she found her groove, or she's just fizzling out. Either way, \\"The Search\\" doesn't even blip on the radar of fantastic Nora Roberts books.     Where do I start? Let's start with the good, lest I be accused of ripping this apart for malicious intent. It wasn't a BAD book. There is a TON of useful dog training information here, the stories of the searches she goes on are genuinely interesting, and her serial killers were delightfully creepy.     The fact that I was rooting for the killer to kill the heroine before the end of the book, however, told me something was very, very wrong.     Let's start with Fiona, the strong female character gone wrong. She comes off very stiff, waffling between overly emotional and excessively analytical, and there's little depth in her interactions with the man she's supposedly in love with. To be honest, the whole relationship felt immature from the beginning, nothing at all like the great interactions we've come to expect from Roberts' great characters.     The hero was, himself, annoying in his own way. He's always very gruff, excessively harsh, but plunges into sappy sentiment on occasion. He claims to be in love with Fiona (our whiny heroine) but in the same breath accuses her of trying to train him. And the constant parallels between humans and dog training-yeah. No.     That said, the plot came in fits and starts between excessive amounts of minutiae. I'm usually interested in things like dog training, but I was praying Roberts would start talking about something else. Soon. Quite frankly, I was bored by the in-depth discussions over, and over, and over again on how to train a dog, and the fact that our heroine rarely discusses anything else. Simon may have found it endearing. I found it annoying.     The bottom line is, I was unable to sympathize with either one of these characters. Her killers had more depth. Am I sorry I read it? No. Will I buy it and add it to my collection? Probably. Will I read it again? With the exception of the occasional visit to some of my favorite parts, probably not.
B003Y7L5W8|4.0|Prior to this CD, I only knew 4 songs by UK synth Pop group OMD; \\"If you leave\\", \\"Forever live and die\\", \\"Sailing on the seven seas\\", and the brilliant \\"Pandora's box\\". my favourite music magazine Q rated their new CD 4 out of 5 stars and that was enough to get me interested.<br /><br />Opening is \\"New babies: new toys\\", a shimmery Pop/Rock number, while lead-off single \\"If you want it\\" is dreamy Pop with a stadium-sized chorus. The title track is split in two with part one bouncy and remniscent of their eighties sound, while part two is more sedate but just as catchy.<br /><br />There isn't a duff track; \\"Sometimes\\" is an enchanting midtempo song, \\"RFWK\\" (which stands for the initials of the quartet) a rather morose ballad, \\"New holy ground\\" a rather hymnal ballad with footsteps for a beat, \\"The future, the past, and forever after\\" a dreamy Dance song with no obvious chorus, \\"Sister Marie says\\" bouncy Pop with operatic female vocals, and \\"Pulse\\" is incredibly groovy synth Pop.<br /><br />From here out are synth ballads; \\"Green\\", \\"Bondage of fate\\", and \\"The right side?\\".<br /><br />\\"History of modern\\" is much more than just nostalgic kitsch.
0345505387|5.0|This book is a graphic novel - lots of the story is in the pictures.  A lot of humor is there and lots of new bits and pieces of information about the original Outlander story.      That said, I loved it.  Not sure what all the critical commentators were expecting. Maybe they need to research what a graphic novel is.     If this author comes out with another graphic novel, I will be first in line to buy it. I would, of course, prefer that she continue the on-going story and complete the next full-length book.  I'm waiting.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|\\"Clapton\\" is Eric Clapton's 19th solo album and it comprises covers and originals ranging in sound from Blues to Pop to Jazz. Sounding as great as ever, he is supported by a stellar cast who never overshadow the real star but ably complement.<br /><br />On the rocking Blues side of things are opening cut the swampy \\"Travelling Alone\\", the Gospel-tinged \\"Judgement day\\" (with Kim Wilson on harmonica), \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\" and \\"Run Back to Your Side\\", while on the calmer side of the Blues are \\"Rockin' chair\\", \\"River Runs Deep\\", \\"Crazy About You Baby\\", \\"That's no way to get along\\", and \\"Hard Times Blues\\".<br /><br />On the Jazzy side of things are the swinging \\"My Very Good Friend The Milkman\\" (with Clapton introducing Walter Richmond and Allen Toussaint on piano, and Wynton Marsalis on trumpet) and the enchanting slow shuffle \\"How Deep Is The Ocean\\". \\"Diamonds Made from Rain\\" is a piano/organ ballad (a new song with Sheryl Crow on backing vocals). \\"When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful\\" is sung in a playful tenor with Marsalis once again on trumpet. Closing is the absolutely spectacular \\"Autumn Leaves\\" sung in a hushed tremulous baritone and with two fabulous guitar breaks, possibly my favourite version yet!<br /><br />Nobody does it quite like Slowhand. Splendid!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Well, as far as *good* coolers go, it's not all too huge, but still in my Antec 900 with M4a89GTD Pro mobo, the fan included rests on top of my first RAM module.    Also, in my personal case, the fan can only be installed on the right side because of airflow from my 120mm exhaust fan (intake and exhaust fans five inches from each other, anyone?)Maybe another could be installed as a CPU exhaust, flowing right into the main case exhaust?    Dimensions and airflow restrictions aside, this is one amazing cooler, brought my temps from a range of 35C to 43C (95-109F) down to below 30C (<86F)-at all times. It's literally never gone above, sans the rare occurrence of ~32C on hot days. It also helps that my room temp averages in the mid-70s to mid-80s.    A truly amazing cooler, affordable, and if you can get around its size, the right one to buy. Also, as I just remembered to include, my fan speeds average in and around 780 RPM

0446560065|4.0|Of course the videos of Simon's cat online are hilarious, and I think the book is enhanced if you have seen those but the book can be enjoyed even if you have never heard of Simon's Cat previously.  It's just that having seen the video you mentally put in all the sound effects and your experience is enhanced.<br /><br />The book is all pictures and no speaking, kind of like the videos in that respect.  The pictures do the talking for themselves.  You get a more in depth picture of Simon's cat and what his inner workings are.  The gnome cartoons are very funny.<br /><br />This makes a good gift for any cat fan, but especially a Simon's Cat fan.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I, like many have been a fan of Eminem since he burst on the scene, showing everyone in the world his undeniable  skill he possesses when it comes to words.  Believed by some, to be the best rapper of all time, Marshall Mathers could retire right now, and forever leave his mark within not only the hip-hop community, but the entire musical world as it stands.  \\"Recovery\\" happens to be his latest release, a little more than a year after his previous effort \\"Relapse.\\"    \\"Relapse\\" is widely considered by fans and critics alike, as perhaps Eminem's weakest output.  Hence, clean off of his addiction, Shady strikes back with perhaps his strongest outings.  With this understanding, I'd like to offer you all with my track by track review of \\"Recovery.\\"     1. Cold Wind Blows - The album kicks off with a pretty tight beat, and Eminem getting us fans ready for what promises to be a sick ride.  A pretty catchy chorus, with Shady doing what he does best.  Overall, a strong track to begin the album and doesn't disappoint.  5/5    2. Talkin' 2 Myself (Feat. Kobe) -  An awesome track here!  Kobe does an amazing job in the background with the chorus.  Eminem apologizes to his fans (and fellow rappers he felt jealous of at the time) for letting elements of his skill fall off due to addiction.  The rhymes are tight, and doesn't stick with one syllable measures.  A sog that flows very nicely throughout.  5/5    3. On Fire - This track seems to be one of those where Eminem just has fun.  He shows his skill here throughout, with a sick beat that flows with.  It did take me a couple listens for it to really grab me, but in the end it holds up and definetly belongs on the album.  4/5    4. Won't Back Down (Feat. Pink) - I have tried to like this track, I really have.  However, after countless listens there seems to be something missing.  Don't get me wrong, I like Pink, and she is strong in the chorus of this song, but I'm not sure if she mixes well with this track.  Also, although Eminemis once again strong lyrically, his rhymes don't seem to go anywhere.  It seems as though he rhymes here for the sake of rhyming and nothing more.  Not a terrible track, but you may find yourself skipping it from time to time.  3.5/5    5. W.T.P. - The party track of the album.  Picture previous gems like \\"D*ug Ballad\\" or \\"C*m On Everybody\\" from the Marshall Mathers LP and Slim Shady LP respectively; add a more mature Eminem, and you get this track!  The beat is hot, and the rhymes and lyrical structure of this song makes it one of the hidden gems off the record.  5/5    6. Going Through Changes - A track dedicated to his daughters, Proof, the fans, and himself as his vows to himself to get up and fight against all that has kept him down.  This is one track you can definetly tell Eminem has matured dramatically in his lyrics.  Structurally, the song also has samples of Hailey's voice from past albums which create an even more intimate feel.  Overall, an amazing track offered to us by Slim.  5/5    7. Not Afraid - The first single off the album.  An amazing track all the way through.  Lyrically, Eminem shows us again just how much he's matured.  This is an uplifting track for any people who may be struggling with things in their lives.  Again, he apologizes to us fans for the way he may have let us down in past albums.  Strong chorus, with great use of a choir as well.  5/5    8. Seduction - This for me, is one of my favorite tracks within the whole album.  There has been much debate as to who or what this song may be directed towards.  Nick Cannon?  Haystack? Is he \\"seducing\\" the rap game?  Hmm??  Either way, the beat to this track is amazing, and Eminem appears to be 100% on his game lyrically as well.  I believe this is a true hidden gem here and wouldn't mind if it became a single somewhere down the line!  5/5    9. No Love (Feat. Lil Wayne) - At first I was unsure about this song because I felt that Lil Wayne and Eminem had such drastically different styles that they conflicted.  However, the more I've listened, their respective styles flow incredibly well together.  An awesome outing here by Wayne who seemingly was on his game for Eminem 100%.  Eminem also kills it here as I literally had my jaw open when I heard his part at first.  I also love the sampling of Haddaway's \\"What is Love?\\"  5/5    10. Space Bound - A complete departure of what we're used to hearing from Em on this track.  An amazing flow here from the beat, lyrics, and a very strong hypnotic chorus that will definitely be stuck in your head for days.  Awesome track overall and much like \\"Seduction\\" is definitely single-worthy.  5/5    11. Cinderella Man - This track is to \\"Recovery\\" what \\"Til I Collapse\\" is to \\"The Eminem Show.\\"  The difference here is again we see the maturity of Shady.  Some of the sickest lyrics I've heard in a song and a flow that is addictive and strong!  This is a bonafide diamond.  Will be sure to have you rapping along all the way through.  5/5    12. 25 To Life - This track again shows a deeper side to Eminem.  The chorus is haunting yet peaceful at the same time.  On top of that, the beat is tight and the flow is just as good.  It makes the listener wonder exactly who or what Eminem is talking about.  A relationship?  the rap game itself?  Either way, with the back vocals done by Liz Rodriguez, makes this a stand-out performance.  5/5    13. So Bad - This is a track similar to \\"Seduction.\\"  Lyrically very strong with a very tight beat to carry the flow throughout.  It also has a very infectious chorus.  Overall, Shady remains strong all the way through.  4.5/5    14. Almost Famous - It took me awhile to really form an opinion on this track.  My first reaction was that thee is so much going on here, everything seems jumbled together.  Although the lyrics are tight, I find it hard to feel how the chorus flows with the rest of the song.  Part of me likes it because it reminds me of \\"Amityville\\" off the Marshall Mathers LP, but againI feel it is a lot of material stuffed into one track, and doesn't really work in the end.  3.5/5    15. Love The Way You Lie (Feat. Rihanna) - The second single offered to us.  Hauntingly beautiful despite the lyrics.  Almost creates a sort of oxymoron.  Rihanna's voice gels so well with Eminem.  The arrangement is very strong, with the strings, piano, violin, and hints of a choir.  Everything flows together so smoothly on this song it's no wonder it fits the radio for a single.  5/5    16. You're Never Over - A track solely dedicated to Proof.  Perhaps the most influential person in Eminem's life.  For those that don't know Proof, I encourage you to read up on him, D12, and his influence on Eminem.  I love this song 100%.  The beat is one of the strongest off the album, and the lyrics are right with it.  Eminem even sings again on this track, and pours his heart into every last bit.  Amazing track!  R.I.P. Proof.  5/5    17. Untitled - A bonus track for us fans.  I must say that even though the lyrics are tight, to me there is no need for this track.  You figure that after an amazingly strong track dedicated to Proof, what would you have to follow on thos album?  Overall, not a bad track per se but there is just no need for it.  3.5/5    Overall, this album is by far one of the best rap albums I've heard in quite awhile.  Eminem show us he has matured to a level that is finally allowing his true talent to shine.  On this album, we don't hear about his mother, his ex-wife Kim in a bad light, and there aren't a lot of shots at pop celebs!  well what does it have?  A grown-up Eminem who appears to be back on top!
B003O86MY8|4.0|I'm a BIG fan of David Garrett, but this CD was bit disappointing.  Certain rock music cannot be translated through the violin simply because of the nature of the instrument.  For example, the music for \\"Live and Let Die\\" lacked the excitement of the song.  (It lacked the oomph-factor, if you well.)  On the other hand, I loved his interpretation of Nirvana's \\"Smells like Teen Spirit.\\"  I don't want to box in Garrett's talent because he is very gifted.  I think it all boils down to the music selection.  He should select the rock music that will accommodate the sound and the spirit of the violin.  Overall, this CD is still worth buying because it includes the classic music from Beethoven and Vivaldi and many others, which he played like no other violinist of our time.  I love the majority of the music from this CD, just not all of it.<br /><br />2/18/11 - my family and I attended David Garrett's live concert in NYC and it was simply AMAZING!  Even his \\"Live and Let Die\\" came alive!  Maybe it was because of the theater's sound system, or maybe it was the pulsating lighting, but his violin worked the magic.  (The missing oomph factor was there, if you well.)  It was definitely better than CD.  I'd gave 5 stars to his live performance!
B003L20IE2|5.0|This movie blew me away in the theater. The effects and the way the film was shot was like nothing I had ever seen before.  If you grew up on video games in the 80s and 90s you will love this movie. Fans of animation and comics will enjoy it as well because the design of the film is like a comic book that has come to life.

B003XWEQ1G|4.0|I don't know why I listened to all the bad reviews when this came out. Scott is one of the best directors alive, I think, and aside from Kingdom Of Heaven I've loved most everything he's done. I should have known he'd deliver a unique Robin Hood, and he did. This director's cut version, while long, gets better as it goes and looks absolutely gorgeous on blu-ray.<br /><br />I saw on the box that it was 2:35 and groaned, but after a decent opening RH just keeps getting better and by halfway I was glad that I had so much left to enjoy. The sets and scenery are stunning, the script more intelligent than most, and there are fine performances from almost everyone, especially Hurt, Von Sydow, Blanchett and Crowe.<br /><br />I can't help but like Crowe in every role he takes on. He personifies the trustworthy honest guy, rarely more so than here. This story is not the normal robbing hood tale, but rather the backstory of how RH became The Legend; it's a more political picture of the Crusades and England vs. France than one would have expected, and Crowe makes Robin thoroughly believable. It's hard not to root for him, and his appropriately edgy chemistry with Cate works nicely. Errol Flynn may have been the perfectly breezy Robin, but Crowe brings a depth that Flynn never essayed. Crowe and Scott hit a peak in Gladiator, and they're not far off that mark here. Not quite there, but still damn good.<br /><br />There's only a small dose of cheese in RH, mostly in the last hour. The climactic battle goes on a little too long, though it's certainly epic; no CGI here. The whole film looks typically Ridley ravishing, and there are some gorgeous shots of the English countryside in full spring bloom that take the breath away. King John is done well by Isaac, and Hurt and the apparently immortal Von Sydow bring real gravitas to their roles. I rarely left the world of this film once I got into it, and that's not easy for a 155 minute flick.<br /><br />So, lesson learned: trust your favorite directors and actors more than your favorite critics!<br /><br />PS The blu-ray is exemplary, marrying a perfect transfer to an hourlong doc that's truly worth watching, a commentary with pictures by Scott, some deleted scenes that are actually as good as the film and could easily have been included, and a few other extras. A film this carefully shot deserves hi-def and it gets it here. This is one film worth getting on BD rather than dvd, no doubt.<br /><br />Ridley Scott: the guy knows how to deliver quality at every step of the filmmaking process.e than your favorite critics!

0545123283|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. You never know what to expect with a follow up but I am glad Maggie made us wait for this installment. It was a fast read and it made me laugh and cry so therefore I call it a success. I can't wait for the next Sam and Grace installment. I would highly recommend this series it is well written and enjoyable.
B001QOGYFO|1.0|There have been many bad comic book movies but few have come from such great source material as \\"Whiteout.\\"  The Greg Rucka comic book is one of the best investigative thrillers out there, but this movie is just terrible.  It's boring, the actors are terrible and even a Syfy Channel knockoff would have known to have some action or something in it to make it watchable.  This tries to be a more serious capital F \\"Film\\" at times like the great comic but just comes off boring.  I could barely stay awake and ended up fastforwarding through most of it.  Though Rucka's \\"Queen & Country\\" would make a great film series and put \\"Bourne\\" and \\"Bond\\" to shame, if it's done as poorly as this I'm glad it hasn't happened.  One star only because there are no zero star reviews.
B0021L8V1G|3.0|I loved this movie when it came out, and loved the first one just as much. I know there are criticisms about the film, but I have none of my own. I'm a bona fide fan.     What does bother me, though, is the lack of features on the standard dvd 2-disc edition. 2 featurettes and a handful of deleted scenes. That's just wrong. I know there is the push for consumers to embrace blu-ray, but this absolutely sucks! I know, I was naive; I thought \\"they won't skimp on extras with this dvd, it's Iron Man.\\" Yeah, right.     In short, if you're holding out on buying a blu-ray player, never buy 2-disc standard dvds of these much touted new releases. You'll be disappointed. Stick with renting, or buying single disc standard editions. As for me, I'm a sucker, I'll be getting that blu-ray player.
0525951652|1.0|I am very sorry Mr. Follett.  I cannot wait to read your new book but I will not pay more for the eBook version than the hardcover.  The only way we seem to be able to get the publisher's attention is to drive the rating down.  My 1 star rating is only targeted at the publisher, not you.<br /><br />To anyone reading this, please do not let Penguin Books, the publisher, rip you off.  Do not buy the Kindle version of this book.  Express your dissatisfaction with their pricing model right here with a 1 star rating.  It is the only way to get Penguin Book's attention.  Many have emailed them directly and Penguin has refused to respond to the issue.<br /><br />Everyone should know that in Canada the eBook version on Amazon is $9.99 and in the UK it is $12.99.<br /><br />Penguin, I will not buy any books you publish until you change you policies on eBook pricing on in the United States.

And the pleasures hold up on repeated viweings- I've watched this 4  times in the last year.<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD- and though I've not seen the truncated and Americanized remake, I know it can't compare to the original.

B001CFLHJA|5.0|I am a jazz pianist myself.  I have been looking for new inspiration for years now.  Aaron Parks makes beautiful and inspiring music.  Everything about this recording (and Dear Someone)is exceptional. The playing, the writing, the production.  He is never indulgent. He is always succinct and well stated. One of the very finest musicians (of any genre)I have ever heard. \\"Peaceful Warrior\\" is a wonderful composition, and \\"Arabesque\\"(Dear Someone album) is perfection that actually touches my pianist soul, in that it savors the beauty and purity of the piano.
1582701709|2.0|Wow. Who buys this sort of stuff? I would never have bought it for myself, but a friend gave it to me as a present. It's a bestseller, but why oh why? I guess it has a certain feelgood factor in a 'When you wish upon a star' manner, but there is nothing else. If you want to get somewhere you need a map; if you want a great future you need to PLAN. This book offers something a little like the NLP timeline principle, which is all about CREATING a future, only in this case there is just mumbo jumbo about vibrations and success coming to those who wish hard enough. 'When you wish upon a star...'.  Are we to suppose that the author alone has access to a higher power? Are we to suppose that the secret has eluded generation after generation, until suddenly it was revealed to the author, to the exclusion of everyone else alive, with the sole purpose of making her lots of money?<br /><br />Now then, this idea might have come out of a two minute study of timeline therapy, which is a technique really worth looking at. This will get you to do tasks such as: 'imagine you're in your ideal place, five years from now. You've achieved everything you want to. See what you will see, hear what you will hear, imagine just how you will feel, and imagine the sorts of things you might be saying to yourself. From this place, look back one year ..., then two years ..., having done this, build a set of steps back to the present you. Now put all those steps in a line, and take a good look at the path you need to take, right now, to get you to where you want to be several years from now.'<br /><br />I'm no expert in this field, but if you want to create a great future, take a look at  [[ASIN:0916990214 Time Line Therapy and the Basis of Personality]], [[ASIN:B0013JFCD2 Change Your Life in Seven Days: The World's Leading Hypnotist Shows You How]], [[ASIN:B000H2REWS Frogs into Princes : Neuro Linguistic Programming]] or any one of the many great books on NLP.<br /><br />Get pro-active. Create your future rather than just passively wishing. Oh, and you'll need a map.<br /><br />Go on, wish hard and feel those vibrations. If nothing happens, you need to wish harder, because you're not wishing hard enough. If we all wish hard enough, all the problems in the world will disappear...I wish. Oh how I wish. If only life were really like that!assively wishing. Oh, and you'll need a map.     Go on, wish hard and feel those vibrations. If nothing happens, you need to wish harder, because you're not wishing hard enough. If we all wish hard enough, all the problems in the world will disappear...I wish. Oh how I wish. If only life were really like that!
0385342047|4.0|Do you like the shopaholic series? If so, you'll like this latest entry in the series. Baby Minnie is now a \\"terrible-two\\" toddler, who obviously has been watching her mum Rebecca very closely, because Minnie is turning into a shopaholic too! And if that isn't bad enough, Minnie's also a willful, stubborn little toddler who has learned how to manipulate her parents and everyone else in her family. But this is just a side issue. Mini Shopaholic is really about Rebecca being able to throw her hubby a surprise birthday party on a shoestring budget. The story is cute and frothy; a nice quick read while on vacation. Check it out just for laughs.
B003MZ0I84|4.0|Years ago I saw a small, relatively unknown band called Maroon 5 open up for the Rolling Stones.  It took less than one full song for my ears to perk up and pay close attention.  The tightness of the band, the stage presence and perfect pitch of Adam Levine was immediately noticeable and without ever hearing them before, my wife and I both looked at each other and said \\"these guys are going to be huge\\".  And little did we know, they became huge.    The abridged version of this review is that this album is phenomenal.  It has pure, melodic pop sensibility in spades throughout.  My only real criticism is that there aren't really any slow songs on it.  The production is a big step up from \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" (there's less synth and an overall much better balance of instruments on this record).      \\"Misery\\" is a great opener and a smart choice as a first single.  It's pop personified and James' guitar playing really starts off the record right.  \\"Give A Little More\\" is one of my favorite songs on the record.  The smooth grooves in the verse are infectious (great bass playing by Micky) and the crooning of Adam really shines on this track.  It's the rhythm that originally drew me into the band's music and this track really showcases it.  \\"Stutter\\" has future single written all over it.  \\"Don't Know Anything\\" shows off Jesse's melodic and tasteful piano, synth and organ playing.  With \\"Never Gonna Leave This Bed\\" you pretty much realize that this record simply has such a well polished and mature sound to it.  \\"I Can't Lie\\" is a brilliant move.  To me, it starts leaning towards a reggae sorta vibe with the signature pop sound that Maroon 5 does so well.  It's a really fun song to listen to and refreshing move by the band.  When you're used to hearing patterns with music, it's nice to hear a track or two take you out of the norm.  \\"Hands All Over\\", the title track, carves out it's own niche with some aggressive electric guitars and vocals.  \\"How\\" is my least favorite song on the record by far.  The repetition on the chorus (especially when the same melody repeats with the bridge) ruins it, but it's a small stain on an otherwise exceptional record.  \\"Get Back In My Life\\" brings you back to the pop sound that's prevalent on the record.  \\"Just A Feeling\\" is another highlight.  It's the perfect slow down song and one of the best songs the band has written to date with a really powerful vibe.  \\"Runaway\\" is a solid song, but nothing that stands out from the rest of the record.  \\"Out of Goodbyes\\" is a much needed closer and to have Lady Antebellum lend her vocal duties is a huge plus.  Not surprisingly, the country vibe comes out on this track and it adds another element to the record.  While this song will be a sleeper for most, it is a very strong track.    Buy the deluxe edition, the bonus tracks are well worth the extra money.  \\"Last Chance\\" fits the pop vibe of the record well and \\"No Curtain Call\\" is another highlight, bringing dramatic violin lines reminiscent of something you'd hear from One Republic.  It has a cool darker vibe that contrasts well with the rest of the album.  \\"If I Ain't Got You\\", while being a cover, is well done and a nice slow song to add to the mix.  All in all, the little diversity added by the Deluxe edition tracks are welcome.    If you're a pop fan or a fan of Maroon 5, you owe it to yourself to buy this record.

B003XQRZ7E|2.0|I am the biggest Bonamassa fan on earth. With that being said, he and his buddies put out a hasty, half-cocked effort.

0316098337|5.0|Donoghue invents the kidnapping of a 19-year-old who we only know as \\"Ma\\".  She's held captive in a shed for seven years by a sadistic rapist she calls \\"Old Nick\\". The 11 x 11 ft. room has some amenities: heat/ac, hot plate, sink, toilet, wardrobe, rug, and TV.  The kidnapper provides enough food to keep her and her just turned 5-year-old son alive.  But when \\"Ma\\" doesn't cooperate, \\"Old Nick\\" retaliates.  The story is told from the little boy's point of view, which turns the novel from a thriller into a joyful loving story of a mother devoted to her child and a child completely reliant on his mother.  She manages to give the boy a terrific childhood under some of the worst conditions you can imagine.    I won't tell any other elements of the story -- because you really, really need to read this book and experience it all for yourself.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Have read every book by the author and thoroughly enjoyed them all. Will not pay the extortion price to download this new book to my kindle. Maybe if many of us refuse to pay, the next book will be about Kindle, and be titled \\"Fall of Kindle\\"
1603580557|4.0|I agree with many of the reviews that this book was very hard to get into.  The writing is rather dry and I couldn't really get into the diagrams. I was required to read this book for a class and I really struggled to get interested (which is why I started looking for reviews/summaries in the first place!).  I also agree with some of the reviews that many of the points she makes seem pretty obvious.     However, the further I got into the book, the more interested I became.  She has excellent real-life examples that I honestly wasn't expecting based on the start of the book. Though I thought some of the beginning portions were obvious I appreciated the simple to complex build up. I don't think I would have enjoyed/understood the ending as much had I skimmed the beginning. I had a hard time putting it down during the last few chapters and an even harder time not regaling my friends with her insights when I finished! Also, important to note that this book is Thinking in Systems: A PRIMER. So in reality, readers should be expecting some \\"obvious\\" points.      Overall, I STRONGLY recommend this book.  I would give it 5 stars, except that it is so hard to get into.  BUT TRY, I promise it's worth it!
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I was not familiar with this band, but I heard \\"Spiralling,\\" the lead track, on Pandora internet radio, bought the album, and fell in love with it. I like just about every song on the album. Creative, literate, infectious, layered pop music. One of my new favorite albums. Will now go out and buy the other albums. I will make no staid comparisons to any songs, albums or bands in my review. I just plain like it.
0312600844|3.0|Spoiler alert. Danger, danger, danger.<br />Finished Freedom. Initial impression is that it's over-hyped, as might be expected. The publishing world needs a book to save Xmas sales and maybe this is the best candidate.  Freedom marks the end of my summer reading season and Tinkers, Europe Central, and the Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet all were more rewarding literary reads.<br /><br />Freedom invites comparisons with Philip Roth's work and I agree with the general comparison, but think Freedom is Roth Lite.<br /><br />With The Corrections, I took away a coherent vision of the thought expressed in the book. There are many interesting thoughts in Freedom - the metaphor of America as a nation of iPods with the freedom to make individual choices is wonderfully spelled out even if it is in the form of a character's rant - but no governing vision or framework that I could make out.<br /><br />At the end, it also seems partially designed for a movie, which often limits a book's literary scope, I think. Franzen offers two endings: 1) the protagonist's mobile phone rings with news of his love's death in an auto accident (auto accidents are the savior of authors who don't know how to dispose of a character they need to rid the story of), and 2) the protagonist and the wife get together after a six-year separation, load up the rental truck, and drive off into the sunset waving to bystanders.<br /><br />In a far less literate way, this is the anti-French Lieutenant's Woman ending, which offered the sugar-coated ending, then intentionally ripped it away from the reader in favor of a far more uncertain possibility going forward. In Freedom, Franzen gives the reader a certain unfortunate (from a literary perspective it can't be called tragic) end, then pours over it the sugar coated icing with all ends tied up neatly and happily, which is doubly confusing given the heavily overcast perspective of the story up until the second end.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|I too refuse to pay the unrealistic price for the Kindle edition. All the reasons have been stated by others in earlier posts. I would just add that for every one person who takes the time to write a comment about the absurd price, 100 others just snicker and pass on by. At this point there are about 30 of us who have voiced an opinion - that would be 30 out of 3,000 who hold that opinion and the loss of around $30,000 in sales if a more reasonable price of $9.99 were set for the Kindle edition.    Someone has made a very bad decision that hurts the readers, our opinion of the publisher and our opinion of the author that he would allow this situation to exist.    Too bad, I might have enjoyed it and would probably have bought the next two releases.    Not at the current stated price though...
B003UERZ88|4.0|Made of Metal is another successful album from Metal God Rob Halford. It's fast, memorable, and probably features the best guitar work I've heard on a Halford album. Rob really is a music genius. Every album he has ever created has its own unique style, and this is no exception. He experiments in all areas of Rock and Metal.<br />  'Fire and Ice' sounds like Rob joined a European power-metal band! It's so refreshing to hear and I wouldn't mind if he made an entire album this way.<br />Some of the songs are sport-based, and I know a lot of Metalheads that are sports fans, so they might appreciate those songs more than I, but they're still very catchy and solid.<br />  I would have liked to hear more songs in Rob's upper register, similar to 'Like There's No Tomorrow,' but where the album lacks in vocals, it makes up for in guitar. Rob still has one of the best voices out there, but the range on this album is somewhat limited. I also would have liked to hear a straight ballad similar to 'In the Morning' and 'Angel.'<br />  Although I would rank this album just after Resurrection and Crucible, I still enjoy it thoroughly and will continue to listen to it many more times.

0767020308|2.0|The relationships between the characters are all out of balance.  We see far too much of Frank, we get a mean and nasty Knightly, an Emma few would love, the Elton's are cartoonish, and the tacked on ending - the Harvest Festival - bringing in the sheaves, we will come rejoicing, bringing...is nothing Austen ever wrote, anywhere! The set piece dance at the end featuring the, here, three couples joined in bliss, Knightly and Emma, Frank and Jane, and Harriet and Robert Martin (Robert Martin? What, you didn't know he was a dancer?) is just contrived romantic twaddle.    Hiss.  Boo.  So NOT Austen.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|I've always seen Avenged Sevenfold as a money-hungry emo-eblematic immatures. Their drummer was great, but overall the band was more about their looks than about making consistent music. This immaturity has abruptly changed! As sad as their drummer's death has been, Mike Portnoy has done an incredible job as subbing for him. He has brought with him all the fast Dream Theater double-bass he's always kept inside and he's let it all out. His drumming, however, is now simply one element in an overall terrific production. All songs are just balanced, with the right amount of vocals, solos, anger, emotions, and everything else that I was expecting from Disturbed, and not Avenged Sevenfold. These guys went even further and threw in a couple songs that sound a little awkward at first (like Fiction), but if you give them a good listen you'll notice their musical depth and maturity. Overall, I thought I will never say this sentence, but Nightmare is one of the freshest, most musically complete albums of the year.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Let me make this very clear. If you are at all squeamish, easily offended by language or sexual situations, or possessed of tender sensibilities, this is not the series for you. Gratuitious and horrific blood and violence, copious, varied, and explicit sex, a large amount of very colourful language (I had to steel my sensibilities here myself; I don't know anybody who uses that kind of language so fluently), and an almost cartoonish graphic-novel approach to Roman history, would tend to weed out quite a few viewers. This is many leagues from \\"I, Claudius\\" - but, on the other hand, you shouldn't watch this series expecting it to be. For those who are willing to forego judgment because of any of the above-listed elements, this series is a huge romp.<br /><br />I went into the viewing of this a relative novice; I don't subscribe to any premium channels, and aside from a little bit of Showtime and HBO enjoyed elsewhere, all I expected was a sort of cheesy rehashing of an old historical tale with low production values. Starz quite vindicated itself with the quality of filming and the great acting by the largely-unknown cast. From the first spurt of blood panned in slow motion across the screen, you know the predominant color in the film will be red; the red of blood, the red of Lucretia's (Lucy Lawless, vamping it up shamelessly) hair, the brown-red of the mountain villa where most of the action takes place.<br /><br />The man we come to know as Spartacus (we are never told his real name), a Thracian little better than a barbarian, is tapped by the local Roman legate to assist in the eradication of an even-more-barbaric tribe that is making a nuisance of itself in the area near Capua, part of the Roman Empire. Events transpire wherein 'Spartacus', the nominal leader of this Thracian band, abandons the Roman interest in favor of saving his own village, which he arrives too late to accomplish. In retribution for his perceived treason, the Roman legate enslaves both 'Spartacus' and his wife - both having escaped the enemy tribe - and the hero sees his wife carried off and himself installed in a remote ludus (gladiator training camp) after fighting free of intended destruction in the arena.<br /><br />The first season is a nonstop, fast-moving spin of battles, training, violent death, sex (mostly by the Roman ruling class), and the conniving of some very witchy ladies. There is also a plethora of bare bosoms, gorgeous physiques, full-frontal nudity of both sexes (yes, that's sensationalism, but then, there it is; and probably not far off the mark of actuality), and blood, blood, blood. The acting is, as has been said, exceptional; Andy Whitfield, as Spartacus, plays his role iron-jawed and full of pride and honor; Manu Bennett, as his arch-rival, plays his role with a wild-eyed craziness that I would be frightened of if I met him on the street. Craig Parker, the legate, (last seen as Haldur the Elf in LOTR), lends the proper amount of slimy superiority to his part, as does his abominable, easy-to-despise wife (Viva Bianca). Lucy Lawless shows she's lost nothing since Xena, Warrior Princess; she plays a more refined, older version of the same woman, surviving by her wits and yet vulnerable.<br /><br />The time period is just as the Roman Empire starts to implode; intrigues and gile are beginning to nibble away at the power of the Roman rule, and those greedy for more standing start to make political moves a bit beyond their grasp. As in chess, it's not the seasoned player that's the danger; it's the ones new to the game, who can introduce a twist unlooked-for. This series is full of sidesteps and plots. Bring an open mind and let yourself be sucked in, as I was.e - both having escaped the enemy tribe - and the hero sees his wife carried off and himself installed in a remote ludus (gladiator training camp) after fighting free of intended destruction in the arena.

B002JIOOB2|5.0|Very satisfied with this item! it was a great deal and overall came   in fast shipping!!!
B002ZG994U|5.0|I occasionally watched the old series, but wasn't really what you'd call a fan.  But I absolutely LOVED this movie!!!!!  So did my 23-year-old daughter.  I don't care WHAT the critics thought, it was a fun, action-filled, laugh-filled movie.  I do hope that they are planning a sequel.  Treat yourself; buy/rent and watch this.
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|Since David Bowie is my favorite artist of all time and this is my favorite album by him I thought I would give my thoughts on it:<br /><br />The album sounds just as good today as it did upon release. The remastering seems to have given the mix room to breathe so to speak. The Ryko release of Station To Station was light on bass and generally sounded a bit brittle. That's not a problem here. I have yet to get DVD-Audio on this but I am looking forward to what they have done with the 5.1 mix of the record. That being said it's an incredible album and the remaster drives that home.<br /><br />The Live Album:<br /><br />After listening to the bootleg of this show a million times there's obviously a change in fidelity (d'uh) and a change in the mix. The audience takes a real backseat in the new mix. They are mixed way down from the original broadcast throughout the tracks, probably to make the individual musicians and Bowie's vocals easier to hear. Where as 'Suffragette City' starts out with Bowie's vocals drowned by crowd noise on the original bootleg you can hear him right out of the gate here. The instruments themselves are much clear throughout. You can really hear George Murry's epic bass work all over the mix.<br /><br />Bowie hit some pretty high and wacky notes during this performance and on this mix they are now burred in crowd noise, under instruments or just mixed out. Most notably during the end of  'Stay' where his loud screeches of Stttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyeeeeeeee are now barely audible. Maybe he was embarrassed, which seems a bit ridiculous considering his odd ramblings during 'Five Years' and 'Waiting For The Man' and the fact that this is his most bootlegged show ever and one of the most bootlegged concerts in the history of bootlegs period.<br /><br />'Panic In Detroit''s nearly 11 minute drum solo is almost completely removed from the track more or less to fit the show onto 2 cd's(?!?!). You'll either miss it or you won't but there was certainly more than enough room to fit it so the decision is once again puzzling. I've read that the full length version of it will be available to download via mp3 but there doesn't seem to be any info in the actual packaging. Maybe there are some instructions or something forthcoming?<br /><br />So overall it sounds pretty great and it's a great show. The remastering went swimmingly and the additional tracks (Waiting For The Man, Life on Mars?/Five Years and a great Queen Bitch) make it finally a complete show. It's no where near as impressive as the remastered/rebuild from the ground up job they did on 'Stage' that made it one of the greatest live albums you always knew it could be but it's still pretty awesome to finally have.<br /><br />A major step in the right direction for Bowie's back catalog.
B0012GMW3Y|5.0|If you want to talk about some of the greatest albums ever recorded, NBB has got to be among the cream of the crop.  Both the last of their final Gene Clark era sound and the predecessor to Sweetheart of the Rodeo, this is some mighty fine psychedelic crafting from these melodic, harmonic, heavyweights.  The album explores everything from their roots sound to a hybridization of raga influenced sound effects that rival Sargeant Pepper and explorations with country and their previous dabblings with jazz.  Decidedly cosmic and trippy, it is interesting how the beautiful, childhood embracing Carole King and Gerry Goffin song \\"Goin' Back\\" still manages to fit in anyway.<br /><br />Best songs have to be the Moody Blues-like \\"Natural Harmony\\" in all its brilliant cosmic glory, the gorgeously poetic country rock of \\"Wasn't Born to Follow,\\" and Crosby's sensuously jazzy \\"Tribal Gathering.\\"  \\"Get to You\\" is also of note, as Gene Clark co-penned this with Roger McGuinn, though he didn't get the credit.  McGuinn has stated this as a fact.<br /><br />Bonus tracks include a rather dated sounding \\"Moog Raga\\" which reminds me of the sound effects from late 70s Atari games, alternative takes on \\"Goin' Back,\\" \\"Draft Morning,\\" and Crosby's disgusting menage a trois piece, \\"Triad,\\" which McGuinn and Hillman were largely opposed to.  Well, who wouldn't be?  This was probably one of many long-term factors that got him fired from the group, and rightly so.  Still, he contributed a lot of good things during his time with the group, and is not to be dismissed.  Check out the hidden track in which he begins a huge argument with Michael Clarke, that escalates to something rather ugly.<br /><br />Despite artistic tensions, this album is nothing short of brilliant, captivating, and timeless despite its dated subject matter.  Beautiful harmonies, lush musical vision, and rapt with poetic lyrics that could melt the Alps, NBB is a great Byrds album that is timeless in its own rite.
0525951652|3.0|I was awaiting this book with considerable enthusiasm. Yet I have found this is small in stature and entertainment compared to the Lanny Budd series written by Upton Sinclair in the 20th Century. So if you really want to insight and understanding of the leaders and social influences of that time written in the form of compelling historical novels tackle that. There are 13 in the series. Not one a disappointment. Start with \\"Worlds Ends\\".
0307454541|4.0|I usually don't write reviews but after reading the ones here I felt compelled to do so. What's odd for me is that I agree with the one star reviews as well as the five star reviews. On the low side; yes, the characters are \\"dull\\" and the writing is sometimes clich&eacute;, and in places unadorned. The author breaks many of the rules for modern fiction.<br /><br />Instead of starting the book with action, or direct conflict and having a compelling hook to keep readers reading, he starts with exposition and continues it for the first third of the book. From the beginning the reader is besieged with so much backstory and details that one begins to wonder if they are reading a novel or a college business textbook. The rule for modern fiction writing is \\"show don't tell.\\" This book, for the first third, is \\"tell don't show.\\" There were times when I wanted to put the book down. I made myself continue reading, however, and was soon swept up in the story, wanting to take the journey with the characters.<br /><br />By the end of the book I realized all the detail and even the \\"lifeless\\" characters made the story come to life for me. The location of the story and history of each of each character made is seem like you were right there with them. Dull or not, I cared about the characters and wanted to know their fate. I also found the plot quite satisfying.<br /><br />For anyone considering reading Girl With The Tattoo Dragon my suggestion is know what you're getting into first. It's a very detailed story that's not in a hurry to deliver the punch line, but once it is delivered there are plenty of surprises and, in my opinion, worth having gone through the details to get there.
044654759X|5.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and loved them all! This book was more suspenseful than his other stories. I could not put it down! I was surprised by the revelations in the end and closed the book smiling! Must READ!!!
0439023513|4.0|I think the perfect sequell to this third book would be \\"The Road\\".  \\"Mockingjay\\" puts you in the perfect mood for the next stage of depression.  That said, I still liked and enjoyed the book.  I was able to, and found it necessary, to put this book down for a few days between beatings, I mean readings.  At times, it did feel like a flogging.  Highly recommended.
0060899220|4.0|Anthony Bourdain is an excellent writer and surprisingly erudite.  I didn't expect his writing to be, frankly, elegant. I guess because when I read this book I knew absolutely zero about him other than what I could glean from the cover.  So, I made some assumptions just by looking at him.  Shame on me, I did attempt to judge a book (and the man) by its cover.  So, I'm thinking...hmm...a chef.  Well, maybe he has some interesting stories but...No matter how good the tale, poor or perfunctory execution won't help.<br /><br />Also, I'm not a foodie.  I'm all about the microwave, making reservations and take out.  But this turned out to be more of a memoir traversing the orgins of his somewhat edgy roots to making a name for himself as high profile chef.  And I do like a good memoir.<br /><br />Though I think the blurb for this book bills it as some sort of expose' of the restaurant business, I think that's overstating things probably for marketing purposes.  I found this book to be substantive, interesting, entertaining, laugh-out-loud funny in spots and Bourdain, here again, surprisingly introspective and self-aware. Like a said: a good MEMOIR.<br /><br />Gina Greenlee, author of [[ASIN:B00X5BJIRC Hush Life]], a fiction debut
B003Y3BMFW|4.0|As we all know today, the Justin Beibers, Rhiannas and the Lady Gaga's are now dominating popular music...it's a shame that nobody saw it coming. These electronic/dance/pop acts have literally stolen rock's thunder-the attitude, the visuals, staging, the unpredictability and wildness-everything. I've listened to hard rock/metal, as well as other types of music most of my adult life, and still get a great charge from it, with the right bands performing it. The '90's bred several major rock bands-Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice, Nirvana, Rage Against The Machine, Pantera, Deftones...the list goes on. Fortunately, some of those bands are now making comebacks. Seems there is a real rock & roll resurgence going on-there are a large demographic of people out there that REALLY don't want to hear or just simply can't connect with these cookie cutter American Idol put together, slick dance/pop acts that have dominated the charts over the last decade-me included.This demographic is starving to hear real unabashed bluesy balls to the wall raw rock music again-the way it used to be. Soundgarden's unreleased/greatest hits/DVD package TELEPHANTASM in my opinion justifies this resurgence. Cornell stated on several occasions he would not particpate in a Soundgarden reunion. Fact is, his solo career wasn't working out, and he must have missed what Soungarden built for themselves. They, like Alice, Deftones, STP and Rage have come back to save rock music. As a true rock fan, it is refreshing to know that there is a resurgence going on, and these new so-called rock bands and dance pop acts should take note. It's a reminder of where rock once was-and again where it needs to be.
1439165645|5.0|This is one of those books you know you are going to love after just a few pages. The author, Richard Morais, wrote for Forbes for years and combines a great fictional narrative, full of deep characters, with the detailed observations typical of magazine reporters. I was especially impressed with how the language could go from florid and beautiful to dirty and raw in a single sentence without losing balance. Morais' ability to capture the essence of places and peoples is absolutely transfixing with such visual and aural descriptions that I remember more of a movie than a book. This cinematic quality is not surprising since the intent was to have his friend, Ismail Merchant (of the Merchant-Ivory producing team), develop the narrative into a film. Unfortunately, the producer died unexpectedly before the manuscript was complete.<br /><br />This exploration of family, personal development and professional relationships, all wrapped in the evolution of various food movements is a must read for anyone who likes to travel, cook, and explore new cuisines.
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|Arguably one of his best CD's in years, with a real variety of styles.  Eric seems to be going even deeper into his 'roots' than in \\"From the Cradle\\".   I personally like the up-tempo dixieland jazz style songs, and the traditional blues ones. He has really stripped away the 'electric blues', and gone with mostly acoustic instruments. One song even sounds like it's from his old 'Delaney and Bonnie' album, with background singers.  another reviewer said:  \\"the emotional core of the record is made up of standards-songs like Autumn Leaves, How Deep Is the Ocean, Crazy About You Baby and When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful.\\"  That maybe, but these songs are real snooze's. Slow and 'dirge like', and the last one on the Cd; 'Autumn', Eric's voice sound awful. (sorry, but true)  At 62 min's long; I'd download the album from amazon, and fill up a 78 min. CD with some songs from his 'JJ Cale' or 'From the Cradle' CD's. They would fit right in.
B003V5PPZG|4.0|And when I say I have never been a huge fan I mean that I have a few of their songs on my iphone, but I don't eagerly count down the days until they release a new album. With that being said, I'm surprised this album has been receiving so much hate. It might be a little bit of a departure from their past albums, but is certainly not a major seismic chance in their overall style. In fact, songs like \\"New Divide\\" or \\"What I've Done\\" would have fit in and sounded great next to the more experimental songs on this album. and maybe the one fault of the album is that it doesn't have that one or two \\"typical\\" Linkin Park singles that everyone expects from their albums. However, there are still some very strong songs. Highlights, at least in my opinion include \\"Robot Boy,\\" \\"Burning in the Skies,\\" \\"When They Come For Me,\\" \\"Waiting For the End,\\" \\"The Catalyst,\\" and the two best songs, \\"Blackout\\" and the sure to be dominating radio soon...\\"Iridescent.\\" so that is at least 7 songs I would recommend, which is far more quality then the average album produces these days. is this a life changing album? No. Is it going to change music like Kid A? Of course not. But is it a good rock album? Definitely. If they had combined the best songs from Minutes to Midnight with this album then it would easily have been their best album. Where does it rank compared to their earlier albums? I will let the hardcore fans debate that one, but I think a Thousand Suns is a worthy addition to their catalogue.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|One of his best western movies! Not your typical Western shoot em up, although the action is still there.  A realistic portrait of what being a gunfighter and a man in the old west was like. Highly recommend.
0765326353|5.0|I think Brandon Sanderson has changed the fantasy genre with this book. Admit it, fantasy geeks, we're still grieving over the loss of Robert Jordan, totally pissed at GRRM for going 5 years between books, and sick to death of Harry Potter and the Twihearts being the face of fantasy fiction. Now along comes Brandon Sanderson, the Stephen King of Swords and Sorcery, to lead us to fantasy fiction heaven. Not only (thank you Harriet!) is he going to end the horror of the unfinished Wheel of Time series, but he is so prolific we won't hate the waiting quite so much. (Who am I kidding? We HATE the waiting!)    I love that the story is clean enough for a young reader but more than enough for adults. The magic does not overpower the characters or get in the way of the story. I think a reader who does not normally enjoy fantasy or who might quake at the page count would really enjoy this book. I LOVE the art, though I don't think my kindle would do it justice. You really need to hold this book in your hands.    This is not typical high fantasy, yet it feels like it is. It is not science fiction, but sci fi fans could compare it to Dune. It is not steampunk but it has the raw edges that made me think of China Mieville. It is not historical fantasy but the back story, court intrigue and battle scenes are nearly equal to A Game of Thrones. If it has a standout flaw it is the lack of humor. It is a very intense book. Wit and Syl are the only light characters, both brilliant, but very mysterious. It really is completely unlike anything I've ever read, yet it seems wonderfully familiar. For me the young guns, or millenials, of fantasy are Patrick Rothfuss, Scott Lynch, and Brandon Sanderson. I love the direction they are taking our beloved genre. Can't wait to read the cage fight between Kvothe and Kaladin.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|Did they really need to try and remake 'Fatal Attraction'?  And why do they think Beyonce is an actress?  Oh, wait a minute...she Executive Produced this so she has to get that credit just like she has 'Producer' credits for Cadillac Records.  Hmmm, so if you back the movie you are instantly considered an actress.  What a concept.  Oh well, it doesn't matter.  This mindless waste of film is not necessary.  Don't waste your time or money.  Thankfully, my hubby and I didn't have to pay to see this. We read enough reviews and heard from our friends that this was a bore.
B0041YI4ZO|4.0|Wing Chun is one of the major schools of Chinese martial arts.  It uses short, in-close movements as its major means of attack/defense.  This DVD has some excellent examples of the style, and gives some idea of what this form looks like.  This  DVD, in conjunction with the other two Ip Man DVD's give a good historical look at the form and its development.
0307454541|5.0|Amazingly enough I've managed to avoid any spoiler associated with \\"Dragon Tattoo\\". I had heard about the \\"Millenium\\" trilogy of course, but had no clue what the books dealt with. When I finally got around to reading this book over the past couple days, I was a bit curious about what I was getting into, but very skeptical about the rave reviews I kept hearing about.<br /><br />For the first 100 to 150 pages it felt as though I was reading a John Grisham novel which happened to be set in Sweden, it was interesting but I failed to see what all the hype was about? Within the next 50 pages or so I couldn't put it down! I was completely invested in the characters and the story, and I could not wait to see where Larsson was taking me with this tale.<br /><br />There are so many elements to the story; techno thriller, murdery mystery, love story, coming of age tale, historical ficiton, horror tale....so many things combined into one fascinating story you hate for it to end...but can't wait to see how things fall together.<br /><br />\\"Dragon Tattoo\\" is a times a brutal read that will have you squirming in your seat, but at the same time it's not gratuitous horror simply trying to shock the reader. There is an actual element of realism to the actions taken in the book....which enhances the horror ten-fold.<br /><br />I am being extremely vague about the actual story in my review for the simple fact that I enjoyed the entire experience so much more not knowing a thing about it. By going in \\"blind\\" I set myself up for a wild ride, with multiple twists and turns, and allowed the author to shock and surprise me on more than one occassion. If you've been able to avoid knowing what \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" is all about as I had....then do yourself a favor. Quit reading the reviews...and simply click \\"Add to Cart\\".
B00006EXDM|4.0|Classic Stones' album. The remaster improved a lot of the clarity of the guitar parts. One warning, this edition included an altered version of Ruby Tuesday missing some of the overdubs in the chorus. If you've heard the song enough times, you'll notice something sounds *off* and perhaps you'll even notice a few missing guitar parts. Overall though, this edition was sorely needed and the songs are much more forceful.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|MAGIC (2007)    Reviewed days after release:         If you've been been along for the entire wild Bruce Springsteen ride, the overwhelming odds are that you  swiftly embraced and wholeheartedly love Magic. I have and do. The hard core fans who anxiously awaited the release of the record likely sneaked a listen via the net  before the official drop date of October 2 and have read more than their fair share of both the media and fan reviews and critiques.  Those opinions (pro/con and in between) are already well chronicled and I will endeavor not to repeat back those writings here or do a song by song breakdown/analysis of the new disc.        Simply put, the record is group of dazzling current and topical original songs imbued with the very type of sound and music that made Springsteen famous.  While Greetings was an audacious debut that flashed extraordinary talent and the Wild & Innocent mesmerized with its gorgeous songs and stunning arrangements, it was the sound of the album Born to Run that ultimately became the signature sound of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band. Magic has that same resonance.  We all know it when we hear it and have reveled in the glow; the instrumental conclusion of Thunder Road following the patented stage leap when the words end, the four part break in Promised Land moving from piano to lead guitar, to sax to harmonica, the pulsating riff of Jackson Cage spearheaded by Roy's tinkling ivories, the steady thunderous flow of Bobbie Jean, the long lost gem Frankie that finally officially surfaced on Tracks, the intense urgency of Springsteen's vocals and certainly not all, but oh so many others from BTR through BUSA.  It is that one of a kind dense, thick, crashing and melodic sound with those consistently amazing bridge explosions back to the verse.         But that sound was featured only during that one decade (75-85) and Nebraska was in there.  Thereafter, that special E Street signature sound went on hiatus as Springsteen moved in different directions.  The sound popped its head out every now and then; one heard traces occasionally before the band reconvened for the Rising.  But there certainly wasn't an album filled with that one of a kind beautiful noise.  That's not to say that Bruce didn't make great records without the E Street Band; he most emphatically did.  Those efforts were different; most were great and that was more than ok.  The band got together and the Rising was a superb effort; it surely deserves the highest marks and all of the critical acclaim it received.  But that special signature sound, for the most part wasn't a major part of the Rising save for a few flourishes here and there.  With Magic, that E Street signature sound triumphantly returns in an updated mode with all of the bells and whistles, both figuratively and literally.       Magic is a batch of serious songs; you won't find the frat rock of Sherry Darling or the twangy rockabilly style that started to surface on parts of the River. Magic is evocative of that grand and compelling musical style most prevalent from BTR, Darkness, Tracks II and portions of the River.  There was a quote from Van Zandt a few years back in which he mused that the stuff on Tracks II was the best music the band ever made. My guess is that he and the vast majority of those who have been tuned in for the duration possess a special fondness for Springsteen's accomplishment in making a magnificent and timeless classic with Magic.

I found myself unable to stand her most of the time and literally rolling my eyes. I was highly disappointed. Her character has gone beyond the usual selfish silliness to bordering on narcissism.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I, too, was looking forward to reading this hefty book on my little Kindle.  The very first book I read on my device was by Ken Follett, and I was anxiously awaiting this one.  I will NOT buy it at the present price, nor will I purchase other ebooks for that rate.  Please tell anyone who will listen that $20 is TOO MUCH for a book I can't share with others.  We are inventing the rules for this world of ebooks, and I don't want to play at that cost.
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|It seems a lot of people that are \\"fans\\" didn't do their homework in that they THOUGHT this was going to be an album of all new studio material... Had they been following along since the announcement that the Knights are riding again, they would know this was a re-fresher comp because the band had been away for so long.    If you've been down since day one you know the crown jewel is the Dvd with all the music videos on it...The BMF era outtake Black Rain(Prime Cornell). Plus there are some cool alternate takes of a few tracks...And it's cool to have the Pretty Noose version from SNL finally.   For those new to the nudedragons there are tracks all the way from the Deep Six Comp to Down On The Upside plus you get Birth Ritual from the Singles Soundtrack. However all 6 Albums are essential also pick up albums by ToTd, Hater & Wellwater Conspiracy as well.    All we're waiting on now is the B-sides box set, Ben Shepherd's solo album and possibly a dvd release of Louder Than Live/Motorvision.    Also Urged to check out Chris' brother Peter's band Black Market Radio(R.I.P)
0312600844|2.0|I really wanted to like this novel, and I guess I can't say it was horrible, because I ended up reading all 500+ pages. But it seems a pity that Franzen spent so much effort and time to come up with characters and a story that are, in the end, so inconsequential. I also thought his use of adjectives was sometimes silly. Phrases like \\"impossibly pale skin,\\" \\"insanely beautiful hair,\\" \\"ridiculously delicious smell\\" and such made me wince. The environmental issues felt stuck-in, forced, awkward. And why does everybody \\"f**k?\\" No one once \\"made love\\" or \\"had sex.\\" I'll have to re-read The Corrections and see if I can figure out why I thought it was so much better.    I concur with the reviewer \\"Zashibis\\" who made the list of things he/she didn't believe about the plot. Much of it just didn't ring true, (like the happy ending of such a dreary story).

However, it wasn't quite what I expected, it was a bit of a surprise. Rick Wright is no longer there. David Gilmour's vocals are almost entirely absent from the record (with the lone exception, \\"Not Now John\\".)  Even Gilmour's distinctive guitar work is relegated to just a few songs.  It became obvious right away that this is almost entirely a Roger Waters solo album.  But, if you look at it as a Roger Waters solo album, it's a pretty great one.<br /><br />There are a quite a few classics on this.  \\"The Final Cut\\", the title track, is one of my all time favorite PF songs, and features a beautiful solo by Gilmour that could easily stand up to anything on \\"The Wall.\\"  I'm not sure why this wasn't the song they used for \\"Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd\\", rather than \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home.\\"  \\"The Gunner's Dream\\" and the aforementioned \\"Fletcher\\" are also standout tracks.  \\"Not Now John\\" was the big single, and it's the only true \\"rock\\" song on the whole album, and is nothing like anything else on the album.  Roger's favorites from the album seem to be \\"Keep Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\\" and \\"Southampton Dock\\", as these are the songs he seems to perform live the most, but these aren't really complete songs, they're more like segues into other, better songs.  \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" is a good closer to the Roger-era Floyd, about the futility of nuclear war.<br /><br />I hope that the remaining members of Pink Floyd can reunite one more time to create a true, collaborative record, but if \\"The Final Cut\\" is meant to be Roger's last PF album and \\"The Division Bell\\" is Gilmour's last, they've still left a pretty good legacy.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Ok, so the Kindle version is MORE EXPENSIVE than the freaking hard cover book?  I won't be reading this book anytime soon.  All they have to do is spew the electrons.  No paper.  No shipping.  And I'll bet the writer ONLY gets the same amount per book sold.  So who is getting fat off the people who don't read the fine print?  I would buy an iPad today if I were not already at the house.  I might just have bought my last Kindle book.  Thanks Amazon.  From the look at the tag suggestions, I can see I'm not the only one.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|This pricing is INSANE. At 9.99 I would have bought it in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Wake up publishers!
0525951652|5.0|Since so many dim bulbs have crawled out of the woodwork to review a book, based on the PRICE rather than the content of the book, I thought that I'd contribute an equally asinine review with FIVE stars. I'm going to judge this book by it's cover. Very nice!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Have always been a Floyd fan & now that I've finally got around to buying this DVD , I figure in my collection now , is the greatest music DVD ever produced. Do yourself a favour and get this. The music is fantastic & the lightshow is mind blowing. Worth every penny & then some.
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|This movie was first released in 1952. I believe it is one of John Ford's better efforts and provides some historical background for several of Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings. If you are a young person and not familiar with his work this provides a quickie lesson on his style and time. If you are older and familiar with his work you should also feel at home. A host of real paintings, borrowed from several sources, are a bonus. The music is the real thing.     The editing is excellent and one scene flows gently into the next. The color is super. Acting by Jose Ferrer and Eva Gabor is very good and convincing. Of course there is a \\"love angle\\" which I cannot vouch for but it's not too sticky. You cannot escape the atmosphere of the Moulin Rouge (Red Mill) night club. The scenes and action fit the paintings superbly. And if you are not touched by the ending, you have been watching too many shoot-'em-up films.    In my opinion, this Moulin Rouge beats the 2001 version hands down and there is absolutely no similarity.
0553805371|1.0|It's tragic that a scientist as renowned as Hawking would so completely depart from logic and the scientific method.  So sad that he would try to pass this pseudo-science as the real thing.    Instead of encouraging people to seek answers on their own (think for themselves), it fills their minds with nonsense disguised as \\"science\\".  In so doing it's not much different from any other \\"holy book\\".
0321127420|5.0|I've had this book on my wishlist for over 2 months. It's one of those things where I wait and see if I can afford it later, and then later turns into 2 months later. Let me tell you that I feel ridiculously foolish for leaving this on my wishlist for more than the time it takes to ship. If your job is in any way related to software development, you need to read this book NOW.    Surprisingly I already knew a lot about what was in this volume, but in hindsight, it was an incomplete jigsaw puzzle with the pieces laying around everywhere. To complete the analogy this book gave me the picture, of the puzzle, so I knew how the pieces should look when they fit together. I will be reading this book a second time just to burn the concepts into my brain.    As far as the literary quality, it's not dry like some references, but it's not overly exciting. If you're accustomed to reading tech ref documents and white papers then any book, like this, is disneyland in comparison. The authors organized it well, and it delivers the information in a powerful way, with lots of diagrams and code specimens to illustrate the concepts.    I'm glad this book was recommended to me, but I get the feeling that most professionals in my industry have read this volume, so it's an important thing to read.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|The Doobie Brothers have put out album after album over the last 40 years.....If you haven't seen them in concert, believe me, it is an experience you won't believe.....from 8 years, to 99 years, EVERYONE is on their feet, loving every note of every song they play!!!!!  This particular CD/DVD shows how they have improved over the last 4 decades!!!!! They haven't lost a beat, their sound is something you can always pick up. The voices of Tom Johnson and Patrick Simmons are as harmonious as always. The band that backs them all are Doobie Brothers. Guy Allison on keys, tears up the title song \\"World Gone Crazy\\" with keyboards like you haven't heard in Rock for decades!!! Outstanding!!!  Marc Russo, on Saxaphone and Clarinet, brings chills to your soul!!!!!! And who would ever forget \\"Big\\" Mike Hossack on drums!!! And Ed Toth on drums as well, between the two of them they kick it!! John McFee, who plays everything I think, does quite a job with his guitar, voice and Violin and Steel Guitar, man, what talent!!!!!!  Skylark on bass, always reaches a place that makes you want to move to the bass line...although recently not on tour with the band, due to an illness, after 15 years as a Doobie Brother, you feel his presence!!!!

LOVE IT!!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|You'd be surprised how much you can fit in this bag. You can also tell it's going to be protected. The padding is very thick and the velcro used to secure the sections is strong. I was able to fit a Canon T2i and Sigma SD15 body with 2 lenses for each plus accessories and there were sections left over. It is completely worth the price and more! Plus it has pockets inside to carry whatever else you don't want moving around in there. Like lens cleaning towelettes or 15 rolls of 120 film. Yes, I had those in there too.
0316069884|5.0|Ammmmmazing. Best book about eating I have read - and I have read them all. The author's viewpoints strike hard and provide great conversation for - you guessed it - the dinner table. Happy reader here. Write more. Now.
B003ZK58WM|2.0|A kindle version that's more expensive than the hardback version?  This is greed, pure and simple.  I'm all for authors making money but this is ridiculous....
B001FB55MG|4.0|I am not usually a fan of Adam Sandler's comedies but I found Bedtime Stories to be cute and very creative. This is a children's movie but pretty much any age group will enjoy watching this flick. I am a fan of Keri Russell and Courteney Cox though, these two wonderful actress' are perfect in their roles. This film is part fantasy, part reality and a whole lot of heart. I'm so glad I gave Bedtime Stories a try, enjoy!
B002LW9ITY|5.0|If ur into collecting Disney Diecast Cars. Then, this item is for worth buying. Just imagine, ur purchasing the DVD Blueray CARS movie w/c includes a Gold Mcqueen (rare) & a Ransburg Mater. Is that a COMBO or What?! If ur going to buy the gold mcqueen in ebay...that's too expensive. Buy it in Amazon. You have a Combo pack.    Im pretty much excited on the upcoming Disney CARS 2 next year (June 2011). I wonder what would be the Combo pack for the DVD Blueray Disney CARS 2....hhhhmmmm    Thanks Amazon...Ur heaven sent!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|\\"Hachi A Dog's Tale\\" paints a  poignant (as in painfully affecting the feelings) picture of the dog/human bond. The saying \\"as loyal as a dog\\" is defined by every frame in this sensitive film. If you love dogs and respect loyalty as a virtue, don't miss this touching tale (tail!) Please notice that Parker's family was too busy and unattached to properly care for Hachi. And Hachi rejected them anyway. Hachi was one of those one-man dogs. In my opinion, given the circumstances, it would have been cruel for Parker's family to lock up Hachi in some isolated garage or backyard to block Hachi's drive to wait for Parker at the railroad station. Outstanding, emotional, and unexpected performance by Richard Gere.
B0025KVLV0|4.0|It was good in sound quality but it was with the paper case which I didn't like very much...  It would have been a lot better with the plastic case  however the the music was great especially across the Universe was the one I could not find elsewhere...
B003YBNREI|5.0|I agree with all reviewers so far, no question in my mind this is the best Doobie Brothers album since Stampede and the album I have waited for since the 1989 reunion of the early line-up.  World Gone Crazy has all the elements that Sibling Rivalry, Brotherhood and Cycles lacked: coherence, evenness, consistency in songwriting, production, etc.  Ted Templeman is a genius--he knows how to put together a Doobies album.  The previous three albums lacked a strong producer who could get the most and best of Pat and Tom and could tell the boys when a song is weak and should not be put on the final product.  I am not yet ready to declare this album on the same level as T. Street, Captain, Vices or Stampede; but on the flip side, I am also not yet ready to say it isn't.  No question, strong material here and a fabulous listen from beginning to end, no weak songs.  Time will tell if this is a Career Album.  In the meantime I am going to enjoy World for years to come.
0316286850|5.0|This book has been so incredibly helpful! I have made changes in my daily makeup application and the result is amazing. He really covers all the basics, and then goes into detail explaining how to achieve a dozen or more specific looks. He uses drawings to illustrate each step of the application process, and I sort of wish that he had used real pictures of the model as he progressed through the steps instead. Overall this has been such a wonderful tool, I would definitely buy it again!
0596805888|5.0|I've only read ~3 chapters, but its been great so far! As a programmer(though I don't think only programmers enjoy this book) the nerd references are fun without being too plentiful. I really like Jeff Potter's approach that we should enjoy cooking, the whole experience, I really agree. :) I especially like that this book answers the 'why' questions of cooking. Like why add salt to taste? etc..    My only 'complaint' for the book is recipes I've seen so far don't include how many they'll serve.    This has become my gift idea for fellow geeks. :D
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|First and foremost, I will agree with other reviews that this movies action didn't stand up to the original. There was a quite a bit more talking and plot formation going on but it DID seem to be because of the introduction of new characters and foreshadowing to future events or even the Avengers movie.<br />The introduction of the plotline that the tech that Tony is using is killing him was a big story arc in the comics and was an interesting way to introduce the new arc reactor (triangle chest plate).<br />The replacement of Terence Howard with Don Cheadle was not a happy thought at first but after watching the movie, Don seemed more like War Machine in the long run. In the extra features, there are some good featurettes of War Machine's back-story and how the Military got ahold of the suit.<br />Someone said, they were upset that the Black Widow only does any action at the end and she is beating up cops. No..She is beating up security guards. There is a difference. It was a very short scene and we would liked to have seen more action from her.<br />Someone said, there was no explaination of why Whiplash (Mickey Rourke) hated Tony Stark. This is very false. It is somewhat explained in the movie that Tony's dad was credited with the arc reactor tech but if you look at the spec's or blueprints, Whiplash's fathers name is clearly on the spec's as a designer and they even tell you that his father was a scientist/physicist and Whiplash was also a very accomplished physicist before his family's downfall. Whiplash himself explains that if it wasn't for his father, Tony and Whiplash wouldn't be the men they are.<br />Make sure to watch the short scene after the credits. hint hint<br />Do not let these 2 star reviews sway you. Although it does not stand up to the action you would expect from an Iron Man movie, I will still give it 3-4 stars for the movie in general.<br />Gary Shandling rules...Watch the featurettes.
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|Clapton needed to make a statement after the well received cd with Cale but decided to just to let his guests do the work, same old song dance for Eric, mostly oldies & a couple new ones all pretty much laid back, tossed in a few old reworked blues just for ol time sake...it's ok but it's far from his best work by a long shot...maybe next time
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Highly recommend for ease of ordering, speed of delivery and a product exactly as advertised.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this along with World War Z and I must say this was and still is a fun book to read. There are parts of the book that are a little ridiculous to try when Zombies arrive if and when they do, but hey its still great to know other ways, even though you would never try them. But if you are looking for a gift for someone that loves Zombie movies and the genre in general, this would definitely make a great gift. I have my book next to World War Z, Patriots, US Army Survival Manual, SAS Survival Manual, and How to Survive the World as We Know It. It is definitely an area on my bookshelf that a lot of people like to browse.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|How can it be imaginable that in this day and age, that the Kindle version of this most likely enjoyable book is MORE expensive than the Hardback? What kind of backward, petty thinking could possibly justify that? What's the message? It's costs less to edit, ship, store and distribute, but none the less it's going to cost MORE than a thousand page book? That I can't sell, share or use as a doorstop...    Grow up, or let yourself be dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century at your own loss. Times are a'changing, and I will not buy this book until the price changes too.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I fear that the promise of the Kindle providing reasonable e-book prices is, sadly, like most promises, something that has been broken.  I will not be a party to feeding publisher's greed.  $19.99 for an electronic copy of a book, with no printing costs and minimal distribution costs, is just crazy.  Especially when you factor in the fact that you cannot loan the book to a friend, nor can you resell it, nor can you even donate it to your local library.  I had high hopes for e-books but those hopes are rapidly being dashed.  The time has come to put the Kindle in storage unless and until the publishing industry comes to its senses.
B001TD1XWG|3.0|There was a time when Lil Wayne wanted people to think he was drinkin the Koolaid, because it was good for his career. Then he started drinking it because he wanted to. Now he's just trying to see who he can take down with him.
0345505387|5.0|I have to admit when I first read that this book was to be a graphic novel, I had visions of Archie and Jughead lol.  Determined to keep an open mind, I pre-ordered and waited anxiously.    As I opened this book and flipped through it, I was simply unprepared for the incredible beauty of the artwork.  It took me straight to that fateful moonlight night and the wild ride through the Highlands.  I felt the moonlight and it was so much more than I ever could have imagined or hoped for.  I could not wait to show my Daughter, her major at University is Graphic Art.  I love that we have the Outlander books in common, that we both are crazy about the series.  She usually leans more to the Vampire books and nothing wrong with that, just not my thing.  It is my hope that people order this book with open hearts and minds and get to experience both a twist from the original book and the simply beautiful artwork.  I applaud the collabration between the author and artist.  They hit a perfect balance and the result is this amazing graphic novel.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Director's Cut maybe not as mysterious as the original but the version give director's explanation and more detail the lacked in the original. Commentary is awesome and extra scenes are great. Can't go wrong owning both versions.
B0044430H8|5.0|Having just read the rest of the reviews thus far I can tell you that the bad reviews are the very reason Trent Reznor disbanded Nine Inch Nails.  He didn't want to be constricted to the type of music that people expected from NIN.    I think this is a beautiful collection of music and can't wait to see the movie to see how it is interwoven with the plot.  (To the person who said it \\"isn't music\\" - wow you must have a very small definition of \\"music\\".)    If you think Trent Reznor is and only can be Industrial, skip it.  If you have an open mind to electronic music with a Trent Reznor flare like none other, definitely buy this one!
B000I2J6K0|5.0|this video is fun and keeps you smiling during your workout.  i was able to do through end of second trimester or so.  really did feel like a workout- i worked up a sweat.
B003PNHW3W|5.0|When Trent Reznor announced that he was disbanding Nine Inch Nails he said he was tired of being constrained with the type of music he created because of the expectations that people had with that name.  Not his exact words (by a long shot!) but definitely his meaning behind them.      It's obvious to me that he was quite inspired by his wife in creating this \\"band\\" if you can call it that.  It is Trance with a Trent twist.  Like early NIN it doesn't quite fit into any preconceived or pre-marketed genre.  As always, he is a musical genius and quite possibly/probably ahead of his time.  It's very chill and relaxing - not what you would normally expect from him!    Personally I think a lot of the bad reviews here were from people who wanted NIN reincarnated.  Mariqueen Maandig certainly doesn't have the voice to do Industrial, but she is marvelous singing this.     If you have an open mind, like/love Electronic/Trance (not just Club stuff) music, like/love Trent Reznor's style of music then give this a shot.
B0044CBMXE|3.0|I agree with the other reviewer that this episode was just not up to par.  I admit that I was disappointed.  However, there was comedy because of Daisy and her Lancelot.  First of all Daisy in her underwear was hilarious and then she and Lance trying to call it quits was funny too.  I never really liked the Daisy character much before this episode, but when she bent over with the Monday across her bottom, that was funny.  I thought the writer tried too hard this time around to make Temperance sound stilted and not normal, it was just overboard, \\"I feel I want to hug you now\\", etc.  Yuck.  And it sure didn't take Booth long to find someone else.  That was a disappointment.  I know, I know, he warned her that he would have to \\"move on.\\"  But still.  Caroline was great-she is a great character.  It was a little lame in the premise of running back to save Cam's job.  And the fact that they couldn't work at the Jeffersonian any more....   Wendell was good and Jack and Angela, but it is going to have to get better than this to keep my interest.
B003600DPI|5.0|As far as spy movies and tv shows I've been a big fan. the Bourne series was my favorite. But this series has taken it to a level that surpases any. Much like Star Wars has done for science fiction films I believe 24 has done for  consperecy films. I've watch all eight seasons of 24 and season eight was a ride i'll never forget. I only wish there were more.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|I pre-order this movie months ago with the amazon prime I get it on release day with two day ship. It shipped with an estimated arrival of the 28th but its the 28th and I don't see my movie. They usually are pretty good about this. I wish they don't ship them with USPS again. USPS sucks.    Movie will be awesome once I get it tho.
B00005O3VC|4.0|At first I didn't think I would actually like this movie. I had never actually seen the film before this year, and a friend recommended it to me. Well when I saw some guy pretending to ride a horse in the opening scene I thought for sure this movie had no chance. I was wrong. The dialogue is clever, funny, and it only gets better everytime I see it. The first time through I thought it was OK. As I've seen it a few times now its better everytime. I haven't seen anything else by these guys. Maybe it time I checked out some of their other work. It is easy to see why many view this movie as a classic. It truly is one of a kind.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|TO ME THE BEST HORROR MOVIES ARE  THOSE THAT COULD HAPPEN TO ANY OF US IN A BAD DANGEROUS SITUATION. I DON'T     NEED MONSTER'S OR KNIVE CARRYING PSYCHO'S. MAN AGAINST NATURE, FEAR, OR THE  MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF GOING THROUGH  A HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE IS WHAT I LIKE. WE ALL KNOW THE PLOT. but what i liked was the character development,  the 3 main character's, and great scenery, with some height scenes which i am always afraid of. i don't know  why so many people did not  like this. i am not gonna analyze and pick apart what is wrong with this movie,  i wnated to sit back, get into it, and feel excitement but at the same time be entertained. i liked this  movie alot. just forget about why did  this happen. clear your mind watch it and you will be amazed that  it is very good
0805092455|5.0|Does your early reader enjoy making animal noises?  Then this is the book for you.  Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What do you hear?  is a book about the sounds that the animals at the zoo hear.  Each animal hears a different animal and mentions the sound that they make. The illustrations are simple, but brightly colored for effect.  I enjoyed watching the little ones at school trying to imitate the sounds each animal heard.  A wonderful book for getting your little one interact with the story.    By Kerri J. Busteed  Author of Will's First Hunt   [[ASIN:1609114833 Will's First Hunt]]
0439023513|1.0|Ultimately? Mockingjay was completely unsatisfying and a lackluster conclusion to what could have been a really great series otherwise. The entire time I kept expecting something to happen, a truly triumphant moment that would make Katniss rise above and show us all the true Mockingjay. Instead, we got to hear secondhand accounts of a war vaguely going on in the background while she filmed propos and occasionally disobeyed orders and got into a fight. But none of this would have bothered me, if it wasn't for the fact that the book - like Katniss - was empty. It was gritty, yes, but in a way that didn't give it meaning, only dragged it down into a mire of pointless death and dispair.    It really seemed as though Collins was preparing for a grand finale, where we would see Katniss lead the rebellion or at least be in her own way useful to it, but the rebellion itself was utterly uninspiring. The message was nihlistic at best, the promises made at the beginning of both the series and the book were not kept, and instead of reading about characters who genuinely fought for what they believed in, I found myself in a story about people I barely recognized who voluntarily left their fate in the hands of others while they did everything imaginable to hide from responsibility.    I didn't expect it to be butterflies and daisies, quite the contrary - I expected a true bloodbath. But the one we got was devoid of any meaning, only meant to enhance the image that war is hell. But it is an image that we cease to absorb when the main protagonist seems to not be present at all. There was absolutely no triumph in this book, no rising above adversity, and even the uprising against oppression that was their main goal was undermined by the dour conclusion that once they ended one form of it, another began.     This book was empty of charm, humor, charisma, Katniss, Peeta, or hope. It was empty of all of the best qualities of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.
B0034G4OVS|3.0|Imagine getting stuck on a ski lift and the mountain resort closes down. This is what happens to the three young people in this film.  It's a long drop if they jump off--which one does, with bad results, to say the least; there are wolves all over the place; no one is around to hear them yell; they lack the strength and leverage to climb up to the cable and try to make it all the way back to civilization; and so on.    You will feel the frostbite on your face as they try to figure out what to do.    Not a whole lot of story here, and quite a bit of R-rated language that gets tiresome, but for what it is, it is fairly effective.    Brrrrr!
0385523386|4.0|Piper Kerman thought that her former, slightly shady past, was behind her and was almost forgotten. Unfortunately, sometimes your past catches up to you when you least expect it.In her early 20's she got caught up in some wild parties, fast friends and finds herself getting involved in drug trafficing.  Eight years later, having cleaned up her life, found an apartment and a new love, the police come to her door to turn her world upside down.
B0042GIRYE|5.0|I loved The Foundation.  I'm not a music critic.  I like what I like and I don't think about it too much.  Zac has a singing style that appeals to me and the whole band seems to work well together.  They are truly great musicians.  I didn't think that there was any way they could outdo their last album, but they may have just done it!  From the first time that I listened to You Get What You Give, I was hooked.  I love every song on the album.  I'm thankful for digital music, because if I had a physical copy of this, it would surely get worn out!
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Great synths, beats, charming strangeness, a pleasant shock to hear it genuinely and newly produced in 2010. Loved tracks 4, 8, and 12. Hope Devo marches into the future with more new beats!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|$19.99 for the Kindle version...Yes I know I'm not reviewing the product, but at this price I will never buy this product.  Why must the publisher encourage me to either buy the hard cover (negating the benefits of my kindle) or obtain the digital version elsewhere?
B002ZG999U|5.0|Only Stallone and a few other action directors ( John Woo ) can make these type of action movies. It is an art. The best parts I think is when they blow up that palace and the port. Wow. I wish I was there to see that. That must have been fireworks.  Don't expect anything but adrenalin rushing action scenes. Bad guys and good guys. If they make an expendables 2 it should be good too.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Honestly, this album is great. I pre-ordered it the second I heard the 3 tracks on youtube, which I think at the time were \\"Autumn Leaves\\" \\"Diamonds Made From Rain\\" and \\"Run Back to Your Side.\\" All in all, this has to be his best work since the Unplugged album in my opinion. His new songs are very reminiscent of the Cream era, specifically \\"Run Back to Your Side\\" which has to be my favorite period of Clapton's career as a guitar player. Even the songs on here such as \\"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\\" \\"River Runs Deep\\" and his flawless interpretation of \\"Autumn Leaves\\" bring a really soothing side to this album. I highly recommend this album and can't wait til it arrives! Hopefully by October first! *fingers crossed*
B000000OUJ|5.0|I picked this up at Best Buy yesterday (yea I know 15 years to late, but I was only 3 when this came out). So yea I picked this up because I saw it was on sale for $8 so I was like \\"Ok, I love Wu-Tang and I want more material and $8 is a STEAL!\\" So I picked it up and listened to it this morning and...wow! Everything about this album is nice. There isn't one bad/alright track on here they are all real smooth and work extremely well together. The mood of the album is very dark, as is most Wu albums, and all the features are amazing and fit their part, but it's all Wu so of course they gonna be nice.  Anyway I don't wanna ramble on so I'ma just say this...If you like Wu-Tang, scratch that, if you like REAL HIP-HOP, then pick this up. You won't be disappointed. And if you are, then you must be a Young Money, Kid Cudi, or Kanye West fan. This is for the hip-hop heads who know their stuff
B002NY731U|5.0|Wow, a lot of fans have been wanting RIP pt 2 (myself included) for years. This is as good, but not a direct comparison. The songs all flow well together. The bands is so tight. The guitarist kicks ass. Dave is very angry but not bitter in these lyrics and his vocals. I recommend this not only to 'deth fans but hard rock and metal fans too. A very pleasant surprise from this great band (notice how I didn't say Dave and the boys).
B002VPE1AW|5.0|It is no wonder that this movie broke all box office records. It provided everything that an audience seeks ... adventure, escapism, love, morality, and a sense of wonder. I have seen it three times now, and it still keeps my attention - that is saying something. I hope that they eventually decide to make a sequel to this fascinating movie.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Brand spanking new. Thanks Amazon. Discs Worked fine and were not scratched. Got through the entire season non stop in one day.
B003UYUR10|5.0|After reading many mediocre reviews, I reluctantly bought Prince of Persia. To my surprise, it was a delightful show. Not too violent, no nudity, and just a wild sense of adventure. It reminded me of the Mummy, good family fun (with just a couple of exceptions). I could have done without the snakes, but I loved the acrobatics and sword fighting. A fun popcorn movie!
B00006BTC7|5.0|When I first heard this album in 2009, I was pleasantly surprised. There is hope for the 2000s music after all. \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" is going to be considered a highlight of the decade for many years to come. Interpol create a driving soundscape and style I believe is all their own.<br /><br />I would like to share a few details on the vinyl release. The jacket is single-pocket, with an art insert that states track listing and production credits. A free mp3 download coupon code is included (valid for one album download). A slightly pink hue plastic inner sleeve protects the record. The vinyl is thick, probably 180 gram, with quality sound. Highly recommended over the CD for the experience (I own both). This is a band you want to hear on vinyl!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Okay, I'll admit that I'm a huge Robert Downey Jr. fan! And he is truly exceptional in Sherlock Holmes. What a talented actor to shift gears and adopt the persona of the famed sleuth. He also makes it his own, bringing unique characteristics. I loved the martial arts aspect to the movie as well. Jude Law was not my favorite Dr. Holmes. I think the writers took a little too much liberty with this character. I envioned a frumpy old guy carrying a doctor's bag, living vicariously through Sherlock Holmes' many adventures. Shortcoming aside, this was a still very enjoyable movie.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This is a must see movie.<br /><br />Actually, every president, all military leaders, and every citizen of this planet should see this movie.<br /><br />This is entertaining, drives a strong warning/point of something that could actually happen in our lifetime.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get this movie.
B003HC8I5M|3.0|Phil Collins' solo career has seemed a 30-year attempt to recreate and update the Northern Soul and pop he loved.  He's hit with covers of \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" and \\"A Groovy Kind Of Love,\\" and collaborated with R&B creative forces like Lamont Dozier, Philip Bailey and members of Earth Wind & Fire's horn section. Thing is, singers who shared the superstar spotlight with him at his 1983-93 peak (Rod Stewart, Michael McDonald, even Seal) released their own takes on Motown's evergreen songbook.<br /><br />But Collins, whose love of classic R&B shaped his drumming and songwriting style, took matters a step further. He brought three members of Motown's legendary Funk Brothers backup group and painstakingly recreated the arrangements and most of all, feel of those Motown hits. The result, \\"Goin' Back\\" is exciting yet disconcerting.<br /><br />Against all odds, even the most discerning ear would find it hard to pick original from copy: the introductions of Stevie Wonder's \\"Uptight\\" and the Temptations' \\"Papa Was A Rolling Stone\\" are precise down to the ominous strings and wah-wah pedal legendary producer Norman Whitfield used on that #1 1972 hit. Things are spot-on until Collins starts to sing.<br /><br />Then you're reminded his reedy voice, effective on the dark, confessional ballads which made him a superstar (\\"One More Night,\\" \\"Separate Lives\\"), pales compared to Levi Stubbs, Dennis Edwards, David Ruffin and the titanic black voices who carried these songs to the top of charts and hearts - including Collins' own. One thin British voice can't cry, plead, accuse, even laugh as those five rich Detroit voices did going back over their dad's sordid life.<br /><br />Collins fares better covering Motown's female artists: \\"In My Lonely Room\\" carries an infectious groove, \\"Love Is Here And Now You're Gone\\" and \\"Jimmy Mack\\" retain their slink and gallop (again, Collins' arrangements are letter-perfect, though he sings sweet where Diana talked tough and changed Martha's protagonist.) Collins' stellar, heartfelt versions of two Stevie Wonder ballads (\\"Blame It On The Sun\\" and \\"Never Thought You'd Leave In Summer\\") recall his string of sensitive 80s hits. Few artists sing anger better than Collins, leading you to wonder what he could have done with \\"The Love I Saw In You Was Just A Mirage,\\" \\"One More Heartache,\\" and had he chosen Frank Wilson's beloved \\"Do I Love You\\" over the Ronettes' 1964 hit with same title.<br /><br />Jackson Browne once said, \\"Motown made those records the way they made the '55 Chevrolet. It's still beautiful and it still drives.\\" Phil Collins' attempt to recreate the music which, to a degree, created him is a cut above crass baby boomer nostalgia for his recreating the full sound of an era rather than its echo. Or, as he sang in the title song, \\" But thinking young and growing older is no sin.\\" Buy \\"Goin' Back\\" if you already have the Motown originals.elt versions of two Stevie Wonder ballads (\\"Blame It On The Sun\\" and \\"Never Thought You'd Leave In Summer\\") recall his string of sensitive 80s hits.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|TOY STORY 3<br /><br />STARRING: The voices of: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Michael Keaton, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Wallace Shawn, Don Rickles, Jodi Benson, Blake Clarke, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris and Laurie Metcalf<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: John Lasseter, Lee Unkrich, Andrew Stanton and Michael Arndt<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Lee Unkrich<br /><br />Rated: G<br />Genre: Animation / Comedy<br />Release Date: 18 June 2010<br />Review Date: 21 September 2010<br /><br />I was only 11-years-old when Toy Story hit theaters back in 1995, and to this day it remains my all-time favorite animated film. It changed the face of animation forever and graced us with some of the warmest characters we've ever known. Toy Story 3 brings all those fond memories and adventures back home for us, once more.<br /><br />Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Time Allen) are still the personal toys of their beloved child, Andy. But Andy is all grown up, and off to college. Whatever is to happen to Woody and the gang? Only a select group of the toys we met in the original film remain in Andy's long forgotten toy box, which is brilliantly realistic, and they are all begging to be played with.<br /><br />When a final excruciatingly, disappointing attempt to gain Andy's attention and affection fails them; the toys begin to accept that they are no longer needed, and this crushes their spirits. It soon becomes blindingly obvious that their near future will be coursed down one of only three lonely and unfamiliar roads: leading them either to the attic, the garbage, or as donations to a daycare.<br /><br />Much to everyone's surprise, including Woody's - Woody finds himself the only toy in which Andy has chosen to take to college. The rest of them wind up by mistake, in a box designated the `daycare' box, by Andy's mom. Woody adds himself to this donation parcel, in hopes of springing everyone free from the no doubt horrible daycare, first chance he gets.<br /><br />Everyone but Woody seems pretty fond of the idea of daycare. And why shouldn't they? None of them were selected to go to college with Andy. The idea of new children in tempered with their youth wanting to play with all of them, is as good as paradise. So Woody leaves them behind to go with Andy.<br /><br />Ned Beatty joins the franchise as the voice of Lotso; a bright pink Teddy Bear at the day care, who's child abandoned him. Lotso is head of a gang of toys new to us, to include a Ken doll voiced by none other, than Michael Keaton!<br /><br />Somehow, Disney and Pixar have taken their divine talents in animation to yet another level here, and Toy Story 3 is neck and neck with Despicable Me for my pick for best animated feature of the year. I was expecting to have fun this time around, but feared the formula would become tiresome and the jokes would be recycled from the first two installments. This is not the case. From the hilarious action-packed opening, to the tear jerking finale, Toy Story 3 was one of the best cinematic adventures of the year!<br /><br />At one point Buzz has his voice-pack changed to a Spanish setting and at another Mrs. Potato-Head is able to see with her missing eye left while it's left back in Andy's room. Oh, and Mr. Potato Head has to improvise by using leftover lunch items to substitute for his plastic body when it's otherwise indisposed! These are just a few of the many hilarious moments the movie offers.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is a treat for kids, no doubt. But it will offer them some insight on their feelings about life, and their relationships with the people in their lives, in addition to just entertaining them. It's a cartoon, sure - but it's written very well and it's gushing with moral substance; enough for kids and adults to both indulge in. You won't find that in too many children's films. And let's not forget the amazingly talented cast this franchise has in tow.<br /><br />What I appreciated most about Toy Story 3, that the first two lacked, was the amount of emotion wespill for these characters. We were getting to know them the first two times around, but as I mentioned early on; now - much like Andy, we've grown up with them.  Seeing them left behind by Andy, and the brilliant ending - ripped me apart. We really care about these characters by the end of the film, and we've enjoyed the hours we've shared with them over the years. But in due time, I suppose we all have to put away childish things. It's a shame, though.s I mentioned early on; now - much like Andy, we've grown up with them.  Seeing them left behind by Andy, and the brilliant ending - ripped me apart.

1401324029|5.0|I will start this by admitting that whoever is actually writing the \\"Richard Castle\\" books is not Doyle or Christie, no.  These aren't mind boggling mysteries, but they ARE extremely entertaining.    I enjoyed [[ASIN:1401310400 Heat Wave]] a lot, but Naked Heat stepped up the writing a bit for me.  Maybe it was just because the characters had already been created, but the author found a better voice.      The scene starts about 3 months after HW, with the fallout from Rook's article about Nikki.  There's a body, then a couple more, and some really interesting connections between them.  The new characters are well formed; the dialog is funny and for the most part not too trite or clichéd, although it does have some close calls.    You will probably end up guessing who the killer is, although the connection will remain a mystery until the end.  And as the saying goes, it's the journey, not the destination.  Even if you've been on the ride before, it's still enjoyable.  :)      Besides, if you're looking at this book you're probably a fan of the show, and how much fun is it to play \\"spot the tie in\\" to Castle?
B003NWS5AO|4.0|Love the song choices and love Plant.  I am a decades long Plant fan and am absolutely enjoying this newest release,  BUT...    A couple of the songs sound very muddy when I listen to them through my new headphones for the studio.  These flaws don't seem to be able to be heard through speakers but are quite noticeable through higher quality headphones.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I agree with the other reviews in that you cannot compare BOB with \\"The Pacific\\". BOB was about the army in Europe,\\"The Pacific\\" is about the marines in that corner of the world. Pacific, well was very close to the books written on GSGT John Basilone, and \\"The Old Breed\\" by Eugene Sledge, and \\" Helmet for my Pillow\\" by Robert Leckie. The statement on cohesion? Where the hell is that coming from? I grew up military, then served myself when I was an adult. Military life tends to lead itself to thoughts somewhat helter skelter. People who survived combat will also tell you the same thing, because this is how life is in the service of your country, pretty much one battle after another, and all that your waiting for is the day your enlistment is up and you go back to \\"the world\\". Then we you come back, things are not the same as when you left, and the friends you had who never went into the military have no reference for any of your experiences.     The last sequence, where all the surviving marines go home, is probably one of the most poinant of the entire series, especially when Eugene Sledge and Sidney Phillips discuss about the subject of why did they come home without a scratch while others gave it all, or came home maimed. The sequence when Eugene goes hunting with his father, and just stops and breaks down in tears....what more could be so real?    I honestly wish my father had gotten the chance to see this before he passed away. I wish everyone could see it, just as it is uncut and as real as it gets. Maybe then people wouldn't be so quick to want to send young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines into combat.    I applaud both Steve Spielberg and Tom Hanks for this special, to me it only solidifies what I already knew, that my father's generation, truly was the greatest, and I thank God I was raised by a man who had been there.
0545123283|3.0|As spring leisurely breaks winter's strong hold on the small town of Mercy Falls, Sam slowly begins to accept the fact that he is not going to turn back into a wolf. At times he's still unable to believe that he's been given this unexpected gift of constant humanity but with Grace by his side, he's willing to accept it. Alternately, the once unflappable, practical Grace is feeling more and more restless with the arrival of spring. On top of the strange symptoms she's been experiencing, Grace's previously non-involved parents have become increasingly more and more resistant to Sam's steady presence in her life. Which is the last thing either want to deal with as Beck's new wolves begin to return to their human form - full of confusion and uncontrollable instincts; ultimately requiring direction and protection from Sam.<br /><br />Even though I adore Maggie Stiefvater's books and her unusually beautiful writing, I resisted picking up her latest, LINGER, out of sheer perversity. Really, let me explain. Hands-down, SHIVER had one of the loveliest endings I've read in quite some time and I just wasn't ready to watch life unravel for Sam and Grace as I knew it ultimately would. Eventually I gave in. And I'm glad I did. Maggie Stiefvater is truly an amazingly talented writer. Her words flow so easily from the pages, full of incredible imagery and sensory descriptions so strong I found myself thinking about particular scenes from LINGER - in detail - days after finishing the book. I also quickly fell in love with the additional narrative voices of Isabel Culpeper and Cole, one of Beck's new wolves. Isabel was a stand-out character from Shiver and her straight-forward approach to life could not be more refreshing. Undeniably, Ms. Stiefvater is unparalleled at her craft but I did find myself bothered by a couple of aspects of the novel.<br /><br />Which leads me to the list of... Things that Bothered Me in Linger:<br /><br />1. Another Absurdly Talented Musician. I get it that Maggie Stiefvater herself is something of a musical genius (I am not, so I will simply bow down to her prowess) but do we really need yet another dreamy boy with a passion for all things music? And then the fact that Cole and Sam never even once discuss their shared interest in music (highly improbably in my experience with musicians) is incredibly suspect. Can we not just find another interest for our characters? Which leads me to...<br /><br />2. Cole. While I love me a bad-boy rocker, I have issues with certain aspects of his character. The bad-boy part I'm totally on board with - especially the whole: I'm jaded, where's my next big high? persona. Love that. It's the tortured genius thing I don't really believe. That whole explanation seemed rushed and basically wound up as a convenient plot solution. Hopefully this is addressed more in Forever, because I really, really like Cole - I just don't think he's been fully developed yet.<br /><br />3. NARKOTIKA. Can someone please explain to me why in heavens name Cole's band is called NARKOTIKA?! And WHY is it always written in caps? I feel like I should be yelling it every time I read it. (Gee, I guess I'm supposed to.)<br /><br />4. Crappy Parents. Yet again. And this award doesn't just go to Grace's parental units (Hello! Can you not tell your daughter is sick here?). The Culpepers, Cole's smarty-pants family, and even Sam's adopted father, Beck, all seem to be gunning for this coveted title. I know Grace tends to envy Sam's upbringing, but Beck has always seemed a little off to me with his whole \\"let me bite and create more unstable werewolves\\" thing.<br /><br />Harsh, right? I know. But it's not to say that I didn't like LINGER. Really, I did. It just isn't my favorite although guaranteed I'll be tracking down FOREVER (which, HELLO! has a gorgeous new cover) once it's released next year to find out how it all ends for Sam, Grace, Isabel, and Cole.elf is something of a musical genius (I am not, so I will simply bow down to her prowess) but do we really need yet another dreamy boy with a passion for all things music?

0714845183|3.0|I expected a lot based on the other reviews, and although I have not read the text, I was dissapointed with many of the reproductions in this book... some are washed out, other's have glare from the photogrpher's lights.  I saw many of these paintings in person on a recent trip to the UK, and I know it could have been a lot better.  It's too bad because Waterhouse deserves a book par excelence.
B003RHCS2Q|5.0|I was a fan of Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis.  If those two series - which were both very good - had only been as well written and compelling as SGU, I'd have been a bigger fan.  For this series, the producers decided to follow the formula established by BSG; focus on the characters, put them in space, and don't distract the viewer with aliens and strange creatures.  And it works.  Very well.

044654759X|1.0|Nicholas Sparks, what happen to you? I am so disappointed in Safe Haven. The truly uniqueness of your writing is you allow my imagination to work. In Safe Haven, you had sexual content and cuss words. You are far much better than this.I am truly disappointed in this book.This book shook me to my core and I had nightmares for 3 nights, because it was so hard of content. Do not become so important that you have to lower your standards to sell a book, you are already selling. I truly believed I would never have to write a bad review on you.
B0002Z9XFQ|5.0|I am rating this high but I as yet, have not seen it. The company, two now, that I bought this from keep sending me the wrong operating system, PAL instead of NSTC. The movies are fantastic, I am sure but I cannot seem to get an NSTC version. Now Amazon wants me to rate it. Well, I give the films a thumbs up and fulfillment by Amazon a thumbs down. I have two copies now of the wrong operating system. Amazon seems to not be paying attention to me now. You know what? I'll try again right now. Three times a charm, right?
0385732554|5.0|The Giver takes place in what is supposed to be a utopian society. Everything about a person's life is decided for them by a committee of Elders. Their lives are regulated by a strict set of rules, where breaking one results in an automatic apology, and breaking three results in a release from the Community. The book centers around twelve-year-old Jonas, who discovers that he is the new Receiver of Memory. Being given this job his entire way of life changes, and he discovers that there may be more to the world than just the Community. Having read this book for the first time at age seventeen, I feel I can safely say that the book will interest a wide range of readers. While reading the book, many people told me that they read it in fourth or fifth grade. However, I would not recommend this book for that age. The book deals with some very mature themes including death, emotional and physical pain, and one scene of nudity. I found the book to be fascinating and I had a hard time putting it down. For me the book provided the opportunity to reflect on some of the things that might need to be changed in society today so that the world never needs to create a community like the one in The Giver.

B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Eric Clapton could easily cut 14 tracks of blues and rock interspersed with soaring five minute solos and delicious blues licks. His ability to stretch out a guitar solo and make his stratocaster sing and cry is legendary. He proves this every time he plays a live show. The last time I saw him play live back in 2006, the the live version of layla performed that night had me quite literally moved me to tears.     There's a lot more to Mr. Clapton than just those moments. In his new release of eclectic tunes, Eric's song interpretation and phrasing are spot on. When Eric does a cover of anything, whether it be Robert Johnson or Albert King, he has a way of making it fresh and interesting. His singing on this album is probably the best in his entire career. Not bad for a 65 year old. He always enjoyed the music that the old blues cats played. Now Clapton himself is an old blues cat, and his vocals and playing are supremely assured and confident. When I first listened to the track \\"autumn leaves\\", I pressed repeat 3 times in a row. The song is just so gorgeous, so beautifully arranged, and the Eric's guitar solo so sweet that it was worth the purchase of the album alone. There's also a healthy does of really great piano playing on this disc. Takes you back to the 30's and 40's, in the best way. Clapton does a great job of reviving a genre of american music that is often ignored these days. Perhaps that's because only musicians like Clapton have the ability to capture its charm.     These are great songs, performed by some of the best musicians of the 20th century (clapton includes some fantastic guests on this release). The album features a guitar trio of Clapton, Doyle, and Derek. What more could you want? Perhaps Wynton Marsalis? J.J. Cale? Steve Winwood? They're all here.     Be on the look out for the amazon bonus track \\"midnight hour blues\\". It doesn't come up unless you search for the song in the MP3 store. Other bonus songs are available from itunes \\"I was fooled\\" and Barnes and Noble \\"Take a walk with me\\". A final bonus track was only available from eric clapton's website, \\"You better watch yourself.\\" That means Mr. Clapton has blessed us with 18 new tracks this time around.     My favorite tracks on this release are \\"Autumn Leaves\\" and \\"Rocking Chair\\". This album most resembles the best parts of \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" and \\"Reptile\\".     One final comment, the quality of this recording is stellar. Audiophiles will be sure to pick this one up. It's engineered to perfection.     An album like this is where Clapton shines as an artist. His best contributions weren't from his Phil Collin's produced pop songs of the 80's. That's what Phil does best. His best recordings didn't come from Cream, which was more of a psychedelic jam band that only vaguely resembled the blues roots it was influenced by. His best stuff certainly didn't come out of his days of addiction. His guitar prowess was most fully on display in the early 90's (see 24 nights and From the Cradle). Eric is now the most comfortable and proficient he's ever been as an artist. This is Clapton playing and singing the music he loves. Perhaps that's why the album is simply entitled \\"Clapton\\".
B002ZG981E|5.0|Inception is another beautiful piece of work by Christopher Nolan. It is a wonderful piece of work that tells many stories in one. I saw this in Imax and was strapped to my seat the entire movie.     Leonardo Dicaprio plays a corporate spy who extracts important secrets and information from whichever target he is sent after. Extraction is something that had been done many times, but Inception is a whole other challenge. It is putting an idea into the head of the person dreaming that they will use. The movie is fast paced and action packed.     The cast as a whole does a great job and it is not just Dicaprio that breathes life into this thing. This is a must see and just when I thought the Dark Knight could not be outdone, I think it has been right here. If you have BluRay I suggest seeing this movie in the most visually pleasing picture quality that is available to you, but I am sure this movie will please you on any screen.

B003UERZ88|2.0|I was never a big fan of Priest honestly until Painkiller, then after that i really was mediocre to Tim \\"The Ripper\\" Owens era but did like the heaviness he brought them. When Halford released Resurrection in 2000 i really enjoyed it and thought i had been missing out on what Priest had to offer. Also Rob's side project Fight was really great back in 1993, but no so much on the second album. So i guess you can say i've been a kinda sorta fan of him for a long time. The main reason i was never into Priest was because of the \\"fight for metal\\", \\"live metal\\", \\"we are metal\\" leather and chains type of music. I was more of the gloom and doom of Black Sabbath fan from the time i was little. Also being born in 1975 didn't help since i wasn't really old enough to be exposed to priest until later. So onto this album. There are some notable tracks such as \\"The Mower\\", \\"Like There No Tomorrow\\", \\"We Own Tonight\\" and \\"Matador\\" all which showcase a more melodic heavy side of the album. The production is great but the guitars are tiny, hense giving it that old \\"Turbo like\\" Priest sound, so i guess thats what he was shooting for since Priest can't really put out anything decent anymore. Most older veterans, \\"Dio, R.I.P\\", \\"Ozzy\\", and \\"Bruce Dickinson\\" have all gotten younger guys to start bands with, and so far it has worked, although on most of this album is just sounds a bit boring and like they are just going through the motions, musically. Robs voice sounds great but a little shakey after all these years, which is to be expected since he has been screaming for nearly 40 years.    So while this is not a the most horrible album i've heard it pretty close and it certainly lacks the energy i had hoped for. Some of the tracks are just plain awful with lyrics like \\"Your the Undisputed Heavy Weight Champion Of The World\\", also with a phrase to Mr.T \\"Pity the Fool\\". To the country laden track \\"Till The Day I Die\\", with its cheesy slide guitar and bad chorus that sounds like \\"There A CatIn The Kettle\\", a comical parody for \\"Cats In The Cradle\\", and no i'm not kidding(listen to it). Also its obvious that we are all \\"Living Till The Day We Die, which is emphasized way to much. So as i said this album just runs through the motions for Halford and the band and the energy of Resurrection and Crucible which were just chalked up full of pep is gone. So R.I.P Rob, or get back with Priest or just give it up, your a great singer, but your song writing days are just over brother. Also the car on the front should be a KIA to represent how poorly made and represents the lack of power this album has. Adios.
B001P3SA94|3.0|Cadillac Records was a bad case of trying to put a lot of events and a long time period into a two hour movie. The music is great if you are into that type of music, but if a great story is what interests you like me then it is hard to stay interested for the duration.     Cadillac tells the story of Leonard Chess and his Chess Records outfit. The movie does a poor job of letting us in on how the record company really got started. The main musical careers that are followed are that of Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry and Etta James. Muddy Waters gets by far the largest story in the movie of the three. They also touch on Little Walter and Howlin Wolf, but you don't want to get involved in their story, as you won't get many answers. I did research on Leonard Chess and various other characters from the movie after viewing and found that a lot of information in the movie is very fictional, which is fine, but they should have refined their focus in that case. I won't give away the ending but it is very anticlimactic.     (Spoiler Alert) One part of the movie I really disliked was the fact that they have Leonard Chess act like marriage is so important to him early on in the movie, but then they have him cheat with Etta James while she is intoxicated near the end of the movie? As I said before, too many confused storylines for trying to cover such a long period of time.     Mos Def is a very interesting choice as Chuck Berry in the movie and is actually a bright spot in the movie. It is unfortunate that he was in and out of the movie so quickly and that they didn't really tie up his storyline. Beyonce Knowles also puts in a strong performance, but her late entry in the movie is a disappointment. Adrien Brody is, well, Adrien Brody and kind of just there. If you like the time period and if you like the music then I would suggest this movie for you. Otherwise spend your two hours on something else. Visit [...] for Technology reviews, news and trends.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Congrats Amazon and Dutton/Penguin. You are ruining the Kindle experience by this shocking digital price. I thought $14.99 was W-A-Y too much to pay for a new release in digital format. This one really takes the cake.  I vow that I will not  purchase this book in any format --on principle.  Oh, I'll read it ....but not a penny of my money will go to Dutton's or Amazon's  coffers. And to those who are getting snarky about price reviews, this is a review page for \\"Fall of Giants\\" KINDLE format. Why have separate pages for Kindle and hardcover reviews if we're not \\"allowed\\" to voice displeasure with a specific KINDLE issue ? That does include stratospheric pricing.
B0044430H8|5.0|As a fan of NIN, of course it was a must. Since it is a score and not and official NIN album, I figured it would be a lot like Ghosts I-IV, which was fine with me. It didn't disappoint at all. The problem with some film scores is that they are sometimes overpowering, or there are multiple variations of two or three recurring melodies. This album isn't like that at all. All tracks are highly imaginative, well paced, and thankfully there are no 30 second snippets or five different versions of the same melody. The best thing about a good film score is its ability to provide atmosphere and let the film exist as a complete thing. I think Trent and Atticus did a great job and will hopefully collaborate on future instrumentals/film scores.
0307454541|1.0|I couldn't even read the book it was all over the place.  Course that is just my opinion.
B003XDUCIG|2.0|Being a geek (and an avid cook myself) I was looking forward to this book, and must say I greatly enjoyed the book -- the author provides a wonderful overview not only of the science (and I mean the DEEP science) behind cooking techniques and ingredients but provides an easy \\"how-to\\" on getting involved with molecular gastronomy.  My disappointment stems from the absolutely LOUSY quality of the Kindle edition itself and the terrible support of the website that not only accompanies, but is a crucial part of this book.  First of all, the pictures in the Kindle edition are so small that there's no possible way you can read the small print in the complex diagrams or figure out what techniques are being used (in butterflying a chicken, for instance).  The second issue is that the book constantly refers to URLs in the website ([...])that aren't available.  So, if the technical issues were worked out this could be a GREAT book -- as it is now, it's at best a buggy beta that O'Reilly has seen fit to release as production code.  Who do they think they are, Microsoft???
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I was Very Pleased with the ease of buying from Amazon. It was my first buy and will not be my last. It was easy to find what i was loooking for and the price was the lowest anywhere. I received the movie in two days from ordering, which was very fast. I would rate my buy 5 STARS.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|A great movie for the whole family! The shipping was fast. DVD in new condition- never been open. Great find!
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Just for trivia's sake, \\"Band of Joy,\\" is the name of the band that he and John Bonham were kicking around in, when they were discovered playing in a club by The Yardbird's Jimmy Page.
1439165645|5.0|Sadly, I lent this book to a friend, so I can't read it again and again.  It ended too soon. The characters are richly entertaining and demonstrate the closeness of family intertwined with a veritable cornucopia of flavors and tastes. As the story travels from Mumbai to London to the French countryside and on to Paris, you can almost taste and smell the foods being cooked in the background. From roadside outdoor cooking in India to the tawny upscale bistros of Paris, this is the story of one chef's personal and gastronomical growth. His mentor comes from a most unexpected place, initially in an adversarial role and ultimately as the orchestrator of his huge success.    A priceless read. I want more, sir!
1577314808|5.0|I read this book years ago and was given it recently by a friend. It went over my head when I first read it. This time, everything seems clearer.     Eckhart Tolle talks about 'the voice in your head' that everyone has and most would think they need to be taken to the funny farm for if they admitted to its presence and how we can go about limiting its dominance in our lives.     One favorite sentence was - \\"Real love doesn't make you suffer. How could it?\\" .... (my addition) and be called \\"love\\"?     When I thought about it, as the book goes on, \\"love wouldn't suddenly turn into hurt and nastiness and then swing back to love again\\" - which most of our relationships behave like. Interestingly, that sort of love is the norm of the world but is it really \\"love\\"?. I don't think so. I think we usually only get glimpses of love between bouts of defence and competitiveness with our partners.    I got that becoming aware of our internal dialogue, the voice in our head that we constantly act upon unconsciously, believing that what it says is \\"the truth\\", and seeing that it generally operates from our childhood experience, our pedigogy, our fears (all of the past), is a big step to giving it a dummy and allowing our real but mostly hidden selves, to step forward in the now to improve our relationships with partners and other people in general.    A book everyone could benefit from reading.  A big task to take on though.
0525951652|1.0|No way....the kindle edition is more expensive than the hardback?  While I'd love to read this book, there's no way I'm paying this much for the Kindle edition.  I'll wait a year or two until it hits in paperback and then hopefully the Kindle edition will be lower.  If this is a growing trend, then, bye-bye Kindle...and the 3 Kindle devices I was going to buy for Christmas gifts!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|The product was as it should be.  Everything was there and in good condition.
0525951652|5.0|I am a huge Ken Follett fan.  I have not read the book yet, but when I do I will actually review the content of the book.  Anyway, I went out this morning and picked up a copy of Fall Of Giants.  I actually went to my local bookstore and paid nearly $30 for it.  I decided to check out the reviews tonight, here on Amazon.  I was shocked to see it was getting poor reviews.  And then I discovered the low rating had little to do with the quality of the book and everything to do with the Kindle price!  I am so sick of people using the review section to complain about the price!  I'm sorry that the price is higher than they would like.  I actually agree that Kindle prices should be lower, but this is not the place to be complaining about it.  People need to contact the publisher.  Or don't buy the book!!    UPDATE:  I just finished the book and it is worth every penny I spent on it.  It ranks right up there with Pillars and World, which are my favorite Follett books.  It is fast paced and easy to read.  Follett sucks you in on the first page and doesn't let you go util the last page!
B0040PYVTW|5.0|Thank you, again, Amazon for your daily deals offerings for without today's deal, \\"I Need a Dollar\\", I would probably never have come across this album.  And, oh how happy I am that I did!  The musicianship is fantastic, the vocals are smooth and interesting, the arrangements pull the listener in, and the album becomes not so much background music, but a listening experience.  Definitely cash spent well!
0525951652|1.0|There are too many wonderful books to read to waste $19.99 on this one for my Kindle.     Shame on the greedy publishers.  I won't be reading this KF book.      12/30/10 Update:   When he Kindle edition is less than the hardback, I will order it.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|The story line is presented with great lyrics and music. I think my only conplaint is that Christine sings of her marriage for him (her son). Difficult to know you are pregnant in one nights time. Perhaps if the lyrics were change in the song Beneath the Moonlit Sky to say \\"on that night a month before you wed\\", rather than \\"on that night before you wed\\".
0143118420|5.0|I started reading a borrowed book and knew right away I needed to see the movie and own my own book.  I applaud Elizabeth Gilbert for her bold courage to be true to herself and search for her inner spirituality, strength and peace.  The problem with the negative reviews is that people are afraid to search for their spirituality and listen to the stillness inside of them.  They are too busy looking to put on false fronts to please other people rather than pleasing themselves.  I have busied myself for 65 years trying to be the best daughter, wife, mother, , friend, employee and waited far too long to tap into my own spirituality and true love of self.  Thank you Elizabeth Gilbert and Julie Roberts for putting this message out there.  The book and the movie were the best ever. It has made a HUGE impact in my life.  I now have my own book and have many tabs on the special pages.
B001LFWVNW|4.0|I'm planning to read Sam Wasson's new book [[ASIN:0061774154 Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M.: Audrey Hepburn, Breakfast at Tiffany's, and the Dawn of the Modern Woman]].  To get there, I first read Truman Capote's original story.  Next up, viewing of Blake Edwards' 1961 film.  Then, on to Wasson's book.<br /><br />The three additional stories here are of little weight and value - it's 'Breakfast' that is Capote's slim masterpiece. Its 119 small, generously spaced pages can be easily gulped down in a single setting.<br /><br />Like 'Catcher in the Rye,' the reader is left amazed that these words were conceived and written 50+ years ago (original publication date: 1958) so vibrant do they feel.  Capote's original incarnation makes much plainer than the book the nature of Holly's true vocation.  And, contrary to Audrey Hepburn's gauzy, iconographic screen beauty, Capote's Ms. Golightly is, while lithe, of coarser and tougher stock.  When my wife asked me my opinion after finishing it, my immediate reaction was that it was sadder and darker than I expected.<br /><br />Capote's writing is a marvel.  As Norman Mailer's cover blurb notes: Capote was - at one point - seen as the best writer of his generation.  It's hard not to read these pages and think of his blazing start as a young writer and juxtapose that against the parody he'd become later in life.  He abused and wasted his talent through prodigious consumption of drugs and alcohol, not to mention a well-honed talent for blowing up important friendships with his thinly disguised literary send-ups.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|I was lucky enough to see Slipknot live on their \\"All Hope is Gone\\" tour, and an impressive show it was, easily ranking in my top 3 for best concerts ever.  So, I was really happy to see this DVD coming.  This is their performance at the 2009 Download festival.  This is easily one of the best Live DVD's that you will ever see.  There's really not much more to say about it.  If you're even a casual Slipknot fan, seeing them in their element, doing what they love to do and excel at is simply incredible.  I'm not really sure what the people giving it low ratings just because it's not Blu-Ray is all about.  First of all, you havn't seen it.  You're whining and giving a review/rating based on format.  Are you people really so brainwashed by popular culture that you can't even buy a concert disc of one of your favorite bands, just because it isn't the latest and *supposedly* greatest?  Sorry, I've done the Blu Ray-DVD comparison, and I don't understand the hype anyway.  Someone said \\"Don't buy this and make a statement.\\"  Make what statement?  Make the statement that you're a tool, and will buy whatever the corporate media tells you to buy.  Get real.  While you're whining about your overpriced Blu Ray crap, the rest of us are watching an awesome concert from one of the greatest Metal bands of our time.
B003LWN8F8|5.0|I'm not given to gushing, but this album is great. Marina arrives by way of Kate Bush's strangest (and IMHO best) album, The Dreaming. I believe Marina when she says she was unaware of most people she has been compared to, including Kate. She's not copying the sound, after all, but it's the same wellspring of weirdness. She chirps, and on \\"Mowgli's Road\\" (my favorite of the lot) she actually cukoos. She wails, and belts out some tunes (\\"Hollywood\\"). She makes perfect sense out of seeming contradiction when she pleadingly asked for understanding that \\"I Am Not a Robot\\" but on \\"Oh No!\\" confesses that she knows exactly why she walks and talks like a machine. I also love \\"Shampain,\\" even with it's painful misspelling. The music tends towards banged-out chords and big drums, but all quite tuneful and melodic. If the vocals were AutoTuned, it doesn't sound like it. There's real warmth here. All in all, there's a lot to love.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|Very nice case, no flashy logos or colors but still stylish in a minimalist sort of way. As a camera case its a little large (at least for small digital cameras) so I would think you should pack in a few accessories to keep it secure. However it fits the Canon HF100 camcorder perfectly, very snug fit. I also like that it has a zippered compartment for other accessories like SD cards. Lanyard strap and belt loop is very convenient when on the go. Overall a good looking and functioning case that covers the basics, highly recommended.
B00164KYV4|3.0|Okay, so I'm usually a fan of these movies with the huge famous cast with interlocking stories, and this one came from the book of the same same.  Most of the characters are shallow or completely annoying or both.  The one couple that remains genuine is Jennifer Aniston and Ben Affleck.  They are broken up for the majority of the film, and no one, including the actors played by Aniston and Affleck, are quite sure why.  As is usually the case in these movies, the plots are predictable.  All of the endings are not happy, but I will say they are at least satisfying.  Worth a look if you're a fan of romantic comedy.
141690977X|5.0|This was an amazingly quick read and completely eye opening.  I had never been single as an adult until this past year and was completely clueless about the whole dating scene.  I was making mistakes hand over fist and reading signs totally wrong!  I found myself nodding along with the book, getting angry at myself and then smiling because it made things so much clearer in the end.  This book doesn't beat around the bush ladies!  If you can't handle the unvarnished truth, it's not the book for you, but if you don't want to waste your time on all the wrong guys anymore, this is definitely the book for you!
0316098337|5.0|Room: A Novel was haunting and beautiful. In Donoghue's capable hands a story that could have been morose and tragic was sweetly nuanced and captivated. I was so engaged that I read it in less than two days. The story has stuck with me and the broader revelations that it inspired about the \\"rooms\\" we create in our own lives and the affect they have on our vision of the world. This book has earned a place on my bookshelf.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|I have heard some great, and by \\"great\\" I mean \\"GREAT GR8 GRAYTE.\\" I've read reviews, talked with people I know. And they Eminem has reclaimed his throne. He is back on top of his game. So, I listened to it with caution (his last album \\"Relapse\\" sucked ass). And every track was lyrically amazing. So, Eminem still can make good music. Who woulda thought he could go a whole 77 minutes without dissing celebrities and his ex-wife?    This album really makes me have more respect for Em. He's really been through a lot the past several years. This album is much deeper than his other albums. Some of the tracks really go deep into what he was going through in his pill addiction and how he felt after his best friend Proof died in '06.    Eminem's back on top of his game. And I must say it's good to have him back.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Best cd i've heard in years!very, very, well made.the voices and music just blend so well.i really love it!! jerry.
B001TM1X0O|2.0|This book tries to emphasize on expecting some man to fall head over heels in-love with you right away or else he's trash.  The problem is, life isn't black and white.  Although it makes it a hell of a lot easier for things to be mutual on both ends if he has some predisposed inclination to desire you to the point of utter infatuation, I find the entire methods to be highly impatient and lacking of optimism to the extent that I think all of the women who follow this book will end up being very hated wives that end up getting cheated on because they are so impatient and lack any understanding or regard for their male counterpart.  This book seems to cover all of the bases necessary for only staying with a man who ends up utterly, creepily, obsessed and infatuated with you--but not love and probably not marriage. If people are in love, they don't need to play all of these ridiculous games and constantly make assumptions about what their love-interest is thinking--they can simply ASK THEM.      I'll make it REALLY simple for all of the ladies who are so confused that they have to read a whole book to figure out if he likes you or not: can you ASK HIM if he's into you?  If not, he's not into you.  There.  Done.  Where are my royalties?    I'm going to read another book (which I will not name because I am not being paid to advertise-- I am writing a sincere review) which is supposed to provide a thorough explanation and a lot of sympathy towards men's situations in relationships to the point to where you can actually understand them and work WITH them, instead of expecting them to bend over and take it from you emotionally.
B003ZPCW0S|2.0|I fell to the scepticism that surely if they made a movie about this book, it must be a great read.  I have yet to see the movie and chose to read the book first.... much to my disappointment!  I have been trying to finish it for 3 weeks now and cannot get into at all.  I can hardly believe it made the best sellers list!  I feel the author is terribly conceded in my opinion.  I am not sure I will even waste time on the movie.
B002ZG9968|1.0|I suffer from chronic illness so I look forward to watching engaging movies that help me cope with my lot in life.  As the movie progressed I kept hoping that it would improve by the end the only improvement was that I will never have to watch it again.  The script - crap, the acting - crap, and the money I paid for this piece of crap well why not round it off - crap.
0671784749|5.0|This mystery is one of Agatha Christie's best, if not the best. On a luxury train, filled to capacity, a murder happens that is not entirely unpredictable, but the solution to the baffling murder certainly is. A snowdrift has stopped the train, and while the passengers wait for the track to be cleared, Christie's little Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, goes to work and finds the improbable solution to the mystery.
B000VI70WM|5.0|I love this album. Now I have to admit I am more of a casual fan of Duran Duran. I know a few of their older hits but don't follow them that closely. Now from the other reviews, I see that some of their dedicated fans didn't like this album because they felt it was too different from their older music.  But to me it still sounded somewhat like their older stuff, but with a modern production. Time moves on, you can't keep doing 80's synths. But you still need great melodies which this has. Generally, I'm not an 80's freak. I tend to like more contemporary music and artists. So for me this was a great album and the way forward for a classic band.
B00290JDPM|5.0|Love my Zoom!!! So many features... Sound is great, almost too good. The mics are very sensitive and pick up a bit more of the room than I would like sometimes. Other times it sounds just right. But don't let me confuse you, This is a great piece!! Recommend using the wind guard pretty much all the time. I was really surprised once I got a file into my computer and touched it up a bit. It sounded incredibly clean and true. Live percussion with a little reverb added, sounds amazing. The effects are cool too. Well worth the price. Incredibly handy to keep in your bag and a whole lotta fun!!! It's simple.... Buy one!

0525951652|5.0|UPDATE:  I finished Fall of Giants surprisingly quickly, and I really enjoyed it.  I have to admit that I skimmed through a fair amount of the political discourse--not my bag.  The battle scenes were great, though--suspenseful, exciting, and heartbreaking. The relationships of the characters were my favorite parts of the book, though.  I loved reading about Maud and Walter, and Ethel and Fitz, and Ethel and Maud, and Billy, and Gus, and Katerina and the Russian brothers, and...and....  Let me just say that I anxiously await volume 2.      Original review: I'm barely a quarter of the way into the book (it only arrived yesterday), but I can't put it down. I keep stealing away to read! As a side note, if you don't agree with the Kindle pricing, you should use another forum to express your displeasure. It's not fair to give a book a lousy rating because you don't like how much it costs. But back to the matter at hand: when I have finished Fall of Giants I will update my review.
0553805371|3.0|According to traditional conceptions of the universe, objects move on well-defined paths and have definite histories. Quantum theories, however, have been needed to explain subatomic existence. Today, M-theory is required - it is a whole family of theories, some only applicable in limited ranges; it is also an attempt to reconcile general relativity and quantum mechanics. It tells us that ours is not the only universe, their creation does not require the intervention of a supernatural being, and each has many possible histories.<br /><br />En route, authors Hawking and Mlodinow provide readers with a progression of physics from the early Greeks to modern theories of the origin and nature of the universe. They also make the important point that interpreting the universe depends on the structure we use, and compare our perspectives of the world with those of a goldfish kept in curved bowls that create (in our opinion) distorted reality.<br /><br />Clearly this book is not about thinking small, and the word 'design' in the title is a bit of sly humor since the authors believe that the fundamental answers have nothing to do with intelligent design, religion, or God. If confirmed, this work would be \\"the unifying theory Einstein was hoping to find.\\"<br /><br />As for me, I'm comfortable with basic atomic theory and the Periodic Table of the Elements. If only Einstein could come back and simplify all this.
0439023513|5.0|Sorry, I'm not into long reviews.  But I thought this was a perfect ending to the trilogy.  The beginning was a little slow, but it quickly built up once it hit the middle and didn't stop till the end.  Loved it! One of my favorite YA lit!

0066620996|5.0|Of all the possible ways that you can make money in your business, only a few will make you truly great. At least that's the theory that Jim Collins talks about in his excellent book Good To Great. My favourite part is his hedgehog concept (stop reading here if you want to read this for yourself!).<br /><br />What he talks about in the book is that those companies that make it to great (and not many get this accolade from him!) do so by having a `hedgehog' concept. The `hedgehog' concept comes from the parable of the Fox and the Hedgehog. Foxes know lots of small things; they rush around with new ideas trying to find ways to eat the hedgehog. Hedgehogs know one big thing and know it well - and that is how to roll up into a thorny ball to fool the fox. Jim Collins teaches us all great companies and great thinkers do one thing, they do it deliberately and with deep insight and understanding, they do it consistently and with discipline and it makes them very successful.<br /><br />I love that he breaks this down for us into three components that any individual or business can apply:<br />Passions - what we love to do; Natural Abilities - he calls it genetic encoding - what we can be the best in the world at; and the Economic Driver - where the company can make money (or where we can add value as an individual).<br /><br />This is a really accessible, well-written, original work. It's one of those books that I come backk to again and again when I need a bit of insipration - can't wait to get on to his next one!
0385528752|4.0|Switch is not your typical change management tome.  There's no 10-Step Plan or Come-to-Consensus moment.  Instead, the Heath brothers present a clear 3-part framework based on scientific research of how the human brain works.  In short, the framework advocates appealing to individual's rational (Rider) and emotional (Elephant) sides, and shaping the change path.<br /><br />The book is broken into three sections - Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant and Shape the Path.  Consistent with their earlier book, Made to Stick, and their Fast Company column, Switch is replete with real-world anecdotes about identifying, motivating and executing difficult changes.<br /><br />One story that stuck out for me was Jerry Sternin's work in 1990 with Save the Children in Vietnam.  Save the Children was invited to Vietnam to combat malnutrition.  However, when Sternin arrived, he was given \\"six months to make a difference\\".  This deadline made the research Sternin collected on malnutrition root causes -- poverty, lack of clean water, poor sanitation and nutrition ignorance -- \\"true but useless\\" (TBU).<br /><br />Sternin didn't have the time or money to address the underlying issues.  He needed to identify a more direct way to make a difference.  Forgoing the typical \\"focus on the problem\\" route, Sternin set out in search of bright spots.  Sternin sought out well-nourished village children to learn how they defied the odds.  Once identified, Sternin studied how these homes varied from the norm, on the lookout for deviations related to nutrition.  Through observation, Sternin was able to identify differences in what and how the well-nourished children were fed.<br /><br />Instead of issuing a proclamation of his findings,  Sternin created a change path.  Sternin instituted a mothers-teaching-mothers community program to change feeding habits.  Making these seemingly small adjustments - number of meals per day, individual servings, sweet potato green and shrimp supplements to rice -- dramatically improved childhood nutrition in the studied villages, and then spread throughout the country, eventually reaching 2.2 million people in 265 villages.<br /><br />Besides the humanitarian aspect, what appealed to me about Sternin's story was the problem solving technique.  Instead of getting lost in \\"true but useless\\" (analysis-paralysis) Sternin identified and exploited bright spots.  In a later example, a similar technique is described as Appreciative Inquiry.<br /><br />Reading Switch, I picked up techniques related to change and solving hard problems.  The latter was a pleasant surprise for me.  If your work involves change, hard problems or the combination, I highly recommend Switch.
B003U80I5G|2.0|This version of [[ASIN:B003U80I5G Jane Eyre]] is one of my favorites. I excitedly preordered this DVD a month ago when I found out about it.  Unfortunately, I can only give this DVD two stars. That is one star better than the last \\"remastered\\" release that I reviewed...the extra star is due to the fact that THIS one is at least not missing an entire scene.<br /><br />Far from being remastered as claimed this release is, if you can believe it, even worse than the other I reviewed.  First, it is dark & muddy--I had to crank up the brightness on my TV up almost all the way in order to see any detail at all.  Second, the picture is almost constantly filled with long scratches (sometimes right through the middle), both white & black \\"drop-outs,\\" and a hair or fiber that appears at the top of the screen throughout the entire front credits.  Third, the color fluctuates several times throughout the film.  Fourth, in some scenes the sound is a bit scratchy.<br /><br />And to top it all off the release company (VCI Entertainment), not content to lie on their packaging, had the GALL to insert \\"This Special Edition motion picture has been digitally restored to its present condition\\" before the film.  There's 'truth in advertising' for you.<br /><br />I can't figure out why it is so impossible to get a GOOD release of this film.  But I am tired of releasing companies lying about remastering it.  Don't piss on my leg and tell me its raining.
0307454541|1.0|My experience reading this felt just like reading \\"The Bridges...\\". Poorly written, full of cliches, the main chararacter was the author's fantasy version of himself and so one-sided as to be laughable, and I felt so out of the popular wave I thought I was reading a different book. The plots are silly and not in anyway connected, the characters are cartoons, and even the \\"sensational\\" parts,(the sadistic sex) is stuff you have read about before or at least know exist. I forced myself to finish it, but I knew it wouldn't get better. I was just surprised I was expecting more, because after books like \\"DaVinci Code\\" and the mania surrounding them, I should have known...`Happily went back to where I left off on page 171 of The Singapore Grip...
0812977246|3.0|I don't want to say too much because I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who hasn't read it yet.  I loved most of the book for the same reasons that the other people pointed out; however, I really didn't like the ending.  I thought that the last 5 pages ruined the flow of the rest of the book in that the story suddenly became very forcibly concocted.  It was a very convenient way to make this detective part of a series, but it didn't fit the tone of the rest of the book. Unfortunately, the ending cheapened the rest of the book for me.
0061433047|5.0|This is the latest entry in Pratchett's four-book sub-series about a young witch, Tiffany Aching, as she grows up and learns, appropriately enough for her trade, to be a wise woman. (There are upwards of thirty or forty \\"Discworld\\" books total, which cluster into subgroups around individual characters). While you could certainly start here if you wanted to, new readers might find it more rewarding to begin with [[ASIN:0060012382 The Wee Free Men]], the first in Tiffany's sub-series, followed by [[ASIN:0060586621 A Hat Full of Sky]] and then [[ASIN:0060890339 Wintersmith]], before proceeding to this one.<br /><br />This is billed as a children's / young adult book, although little sets it apart from Pratchett's other fantasy except for some (very) slight bowdlerizations; primarily, this is a young adult book because the heroine is a young adult, and it deals with issues that young adults have to deal with.  Like the Harry Potter books, the content and tone of the Tiffany series have been maturing ever so slightly with each book to match the advancing maturity of the protagonist, and while this one's still suitable for younger readers, it definitely contains a few jokes likely to fly over their heads (at least unless some other source has educated them).  Tiffany herself is portrayed as very mature for her age - a portrayal deliberate on Pratchett's part, I believe, as Tiffany is exactly as mature as most people that age tend to think they are, and almost as mature as she herself wants to be.<br /><br />Each volume in the series sets Tiffany a particular problem to resolve; here the problem (s) are innuendo, rumour, gossip, romantic rivalries, and pointless mob hatred, things that many if not most teenage girls will identify with (even if in Tiffany's case the \\"witch hunt\\" she has to deal with is somewhat more literal). Tiffany's prior romance with Roland, the son of the local Baron, has clearly ended, and Roland's is about to marry Letitia, the daughter of a (very obnoxious) Duchess; meanwhile, some of the residents of the Chalk are stirring up hatred and accusations against Tiffany, and stalking her is the Cunning Man, a personification of suspicion, envious rage, hatred, mob violence, and the witch hunt.<br /><br />Pratchett's typical mastery is still present here, his wit and his wisdom; the only real sign of his advancing illness is that there's a sense, especially in the novel's conclusion, that this may be the final Tiffany Aching novel and the final novel of his Witches series (if only because it features a cameo appearance from a character we haven't seen since the very first Witches-series novel, [[ASIN:0060855908 Equal Rites]], first published twenty-plus years ago). All in all, it's an excellent book, fully as good as anything else he's written, and a book that will definitely please fans of the series and new readers alike.; meanwhile, some of the residents of the Chalk are stirring up hatred and accusations against Tiffany, and stalking her is the Cunning Man, a personification of suspicion, envious rage, hatred, mob violence, and the witch hunt.

1591841666|5.0|How many of us have been stuck at that crossroads of not quite being sure whether to continue or whether to turn back? I know I have. I found Seth Godin's book a real inspiration because he has a very simple strategy for dealing with that question. He tells us to go forward to greatness where we know that we have the capacity to reach the top. Not everyone (or every business) does and if we push through 'the dip' we will emerge stronger and ahead of the competition. If we know we can't achieve that greatness, then better to turn back. This is such a simple but such a profound lesson that I find myself coming back to again and again - highly recommended!
B001P9KR8U|3.0|First the Good: Acting and character selection as well as the choice of the music tracks. The three main characters (Jamal, Salim and Latika) are each portrayed by three different actors. The transitions are smooth, and they resemble quite a bit, so it makes it believable.<br />The storyline is made up of a series of back flashes that give you the background story of Jamal. A key element that ties the story together is Jamal's undying love for Latika, who he eventually wins over.<br /><br />The Bad: Latika becomes the servant of a gangster, and when she tries to run away, her face is scarred. Women are undermined in this film and treated more like property to be used and abused at will, rather than equal human beings. (Maybe this has to do with the Indian culture).<br /><br />The Ugly: What I found quite disturbing about this film is the over-emphasis on the cruelty shown to children. Displayed is the deliberate blinding of children so that when they go begging they would get twice as much. Additionally young Jamal is shown jumping into a sewerage pit and is totally covered in filth. In another scene, while Salim is sleeping naked, minced hot peppers are poured unto his private parts.<br />The elements of this film are tightly intertwined, but you may find that some of the images in this film can leave you disturbed.
0439023513|5.0|This novel served as a perfect conclusion to a trilogy that was steeped in violence, treachery, and raw emotion.  It breaks you down and offers excellent insight into the horrors of war and the difficult decisions that must be made, as well as the long term effects.  If you were looking for lollipops and unicorns, you came to the wrong place.
B003VOP7J6|2.0|A brilliant album, of course.  But like the notorious vinyl reissue of the first Bungle album, this is not a good purchase.  The mastering is extremely quiet;  I found I had to turn the volume to nearly twice the level that my turntable normally requires, and because of that, the sound distorts.  Some might say that this is necessary because of the way the album was recorded (multi-tracked, full-frequency, etc), but I don't think this is the case.  It's a shame, because this album was clearly destined for vinyl (ten songs in 45 minutes, the 60s-style cover, etc).  Warner Bros. should have done it themselves back in 1999, but oh well.
0525951652|1.0|I was looking forward to reading this 1000+ page book on my Kindle but since it is priced so high, I will get on the waiting list at my local library and read it for free.  I thought Amazon was committed to offering best sellers for $9.99.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I loved Ken Follet's Pillars of the Earth, but some of my reasons for buying a Kindle was to be able to read books at a reduced cost while helping the environment. I will not be shelling out an outrageous price of $19.99 for this book. I was very happy with new releases at $9.99, but the prices seem to keep creeping upward....$12.99...$14.99 and now $19.99 - not me! Has it been Amazon's plan to bait customers to buy the Kindle and then jack up the book prices?
0887307280|4.0|A classic business text and a book (a whole series of books now!) that spawned the well-used phrase that an entrepreneur should be working on the business rather than in the business.<br /><br />I have this book and I have learnt a huge amount from it. I've only given the book 4* rather than 5* because I differ from Michael Gerber in my own personal viewpoint about being in business. Gerber writes that we should treat the business as a mechanical object, systematising every process so that the business owner is the creator and the business can be run by technicians (Gerber's model is to imagine the business as a potential franchise even if this isn't the business model you actually want).<br /><br />I completely understand the logic of this approach but differ from Gerber because I think it's important for today's entrepreneur to bring his or her personal qualities, expertise and values to their business. This creates a place for differentiation from the competition.<br /><br />Nevertheless a seminal business book and highly recommended!

0345505387|5.0|I was very anxious to finally see Jamie and Claire in person, albeit on a page.  It definitely added to the scope and richness of the story for me.  I was pleased to learn new things about the characters and have bits of information to mull over until Diana's next publication.  The art work is luscious!  The colors are so rich that I love looking at the frames over and over.  I think the artist did a wonderful job of capturing the characters look and tone.  The best part is you don't have to have read the Outlander series to understand the story, it serves as a stand alone book.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience with a graphic novel.
B0033DOIHC|4.0|I have read the book both in Swedish and in English and it is a good thriller. I found some strange translations in the English version, why is the translator using the word \\"gaol\\" for jail (f&auml;ngelse in Swedish)? Another oddity I noticed was the word \\"Bear Gang\\" for the robbers that Blomquist helped to catch. They wore masks from the comic book Donald Duck and in Swedish the \\"Bear Gang\\" are the same as the \\"Beagle Boys\\" in the Donald Duck comic books.
0765350386|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have read all three books in this trilogy multiple times, and I love all of them. Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite authors and, in my opinion, one of the best in the genre today. Now, the review:    This is the story of, in Mr. Sanderson's own words, what would have happened had the evil lord won. And yet, it's so much more than that. It's a heist story, about a thieving crew who attempts to steal an empire. It's a coming-of-age tale, about a teenage thief who's lived a hard life. It's a story about trust, and friendship, and, in the end, why we keep fighting even when there's no chance of winning. The author takes some of the best ideas in fantasy and mixes them together, throwing in a brilliant magic system and memorable characters in as well.    The magic system is indeed marvelous. The idea of Allomancy is that you use metals to give yourself different boosts, or to affect the emotions of others, or to move metal. It's so well integrated and well explained in the book that I never really feel confused about what's going on. In addition, Sanderson hints at another two systems of magic: Feruchemy, which is the system Keepers can use, and another that Inquisitors use. Simply put, I feel like his magic is real and comprehensible, which is something you don't see in every fantasy novel.    Next, the characters. Vin is a thief girl who at the beginning of the book at least, distrusts everyone and has no friends. Watching her grow to trust the members of her crew is a joy. Kelsier as well is fascinating, with his shadowed past and his humor. He is one of the best characters in the book. Elend, the only character in the book who is a full noble, makes me laugh every time I read about him. He is quite possibly my favorite of all the characters, and that's saying something as I love all of them. Then we have the backup members of the crew: Breeze, Ham, Dox, Sazed, Spook, Clubs, and Marsh, who add levity to what would otherwise be a dark tale and provide different perspectives and wisdom throughout the book.    Last, I am always astounded by the depth and knowledge of religion Sanderson puts into all his books. He doesn't pass over the issues, showing what can happen when a religious figure becomes a tyrant. But he also shows the power and beauty religion can have, and the religious diversity that exists in his world.    Sanderson is my favorite author, and this book, and indeed the trilogy, are his best works. The beginning engrossed me, the middle made me laugh, and I cried at parts of the end. It takes a truly talented author to do that.
B003L77TZI|4.0|I bought Teenage Dream over a month ago. I have listened to it and really like a lot of the songs. I love Katy Perry's last album  One of the Boys. I haven't listened to this one as much yet so I may be adding to this review later. Warning to parents don't by this explicit version for you kids its got some language and suggestions kids don't need to here. Two of the songs on this album I really like are Teenage Dream and California Gurls. If you like upbeat music with some adult humor you will like this album.
0399534601|5.0|I love Keri's book.  It' s the third book i buy...  They are creative, a wonderfull philosophy and an amazing design.  Everyone should have this book at home: for kids, adults...  It doesn't mind who you are: read this book, use this book!

0810995212|2.0|I have collected and treasured Lyendecker covers and materials for 30 years.  Though I welcome a book that finally deals with the fact of the brothers' homosexuality, I must point out its greatest flaw:  there is already a book detailing ALL of JC's covers for the Post.  Therefore, reproducing them was not necessary.  We need a book dealing with the magnificent Collier's covers and, moreover, a real analysis of homoerotic semiotics in the Leyendeckers' work.  As to dissing Rockwell, he was the dog that bit the hand that fed him, and became the graphic voice for an Amerika who has coalesced around the Tea Party. Much more  and deeper analysis of Leyendecker's utter subversion of cultural images is required. His Arrow Man: his lover.  His cherubs: tempting white babies. His athletes: sexy macho brutes. His ruthless critique of consumerism and Capitalism.  His acute depiction of race relations. Not to talk about he does to the Navy! It's all there. It needs to be brought into the light.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|I saw Avatar in an Imax theater 3D and the effect was extraordinary. Of course, you can't have the same efffect on a TV screen. But looking only about the movie by itself, Avatar is kind of a masterpiece. However, I gave only 4 stars, because the story line is predictable and need more twists. Overall, it is a great movie because it has a positive lesson to learn: respect the right of others even for profit. Be humble! For americans, it remind us the massacre of native americans or the age of slavery. It is easy to see terrorism, but we are not all angels either. We did make horrible things as well. Let people live their life if they let you live yours. it is the golden rule. Also respect nature, because all is connected. You need mother nature. Great film !
B003U0AHBO|4.0|I loved this movie.  Even though it is \\"dark\\" in it's portrayal, it has a more authentic feel than previous earlier depictions.  You must keep your eyes on the screen in order to see and not miss the explanations which occasionally show up on the screen.  One has to get used to this version as it doesn't have the beautiful gowns, bright colors, and clean look  that you're probably used to seeing.  I dare say this depiction is more accurate in the telling.  If you have seen  the other movies you will have to suspend your remembrance and reset the order of events.  Russell Crowe and Cate Blanchett never disappoint.  Together they complement each other so well, as do most of the other actors.    This is one movie you shouldn't miss.
B003A4IFGY|4.0|This is Mike Campbell's baby.  Campbell, if you didn't know, is the seriously underrated shred-capable lead guitarist for the Heartbreakers. Like you've never heard before, he kills with his divine '59 Gibson Les Paul, maybe the most desired guitar in existence.  Please, appreciate: each ripple of reverb, the tonal entirety of this six-string dream's palette.    With Tom Petty finally giving his band its due, the liner notes detail the make and vintage of each instrument, each track's made-on date.  Mojo tries to stick as close to live takes as possible, forgoing excessive dubbing, capturing same-room interplay.  This is their music-for-musicians album; this is their Ur-rock blues album.       Mojo opens with \\"Jefferson Jericho Blues\\"--interesting subject matter, that prez's lustful miscegeny--but it's hard to get past the constant harmonica blasts.  \\"Jefferson\\" is a little goofy, especially to open the album.  They'd have been better off with the second cut, \\"First Flash of Freedom,\\" which melodically sounds like a companion piece to \\"The Golden Rose,\\" the superb finale off Petty's last disc, Highway Companion--but more Hammond Organ flourishes and erupting axe workouts.  It's Campbell that elevates \\"First Flash\\" with his liquid slide-guitar lope, reminiscent here of Pink Floyd Stratocaster master David Gilmour's proggy '70s perfection.  The lyrics, as elsewhere on the album, are the Petty basics--old towns with no name, overdue trains--but the song is suggestive enough.  Does its surrealism amount to nascent drug use, sexual awakening, or something else altogether?      But then with \\"Running Man's Bible\\" we get genre exercise, a six minute chug, with vocals patterned off the old call-and-response verses that have been around forever; likewise with \\"Let Yourself Go,\\" where there's the same pitch drop at the end of the lines.  Enjoyable, but not memorable.  Yet another cousin to this style, \\"Candy\\" is bloodless, bringing nothing new to its 12-bar blues.  There'sno doubt Petty is enjoying himself with some in-jokes, but he's outrun his voice, which was never full-throated to begin with.  A few of Mojo's roots calisthenics come up hokey and half-baked.        \\"No Reason to Cry\\" is a middling pedal steel lullaby, inoffensive as far as this kind of song goes.  Conversely, the album swerves violent on the next number.  \\"I Should Have Known It\\" is hard-shelled, as dirty as the Heartbreakers get, with drums descended from John Bonham and a riff off Jimmy Page's Les Paul reborn--Listen and compare with Zep's \\"The Ocean\\".  Petty's unique inflection/phrasing interacts with this new setting, coming out snarling and defiant.  Still, in spots he sounds tired, for all the blistering fretwork backing him.      Nevertheless, Mojo ambitiously maps out a small universe of the blues and its manifestations.  \\"US 41,\\" where Petty does something distinctly Appalachian with his voice, is almost Johnny Cash-like.  Since every self-respecting bluesman has to have a devil piece, there's \\"High in the Morning,\\" complete with those blasphemous backwards guitar lines.  The cathartic closer \\"Good Enough\\" follows in the line of Zeppelin's \\"Since I've Been Lovin' You\\" and Floyd's \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" brand of apocalypse blues, all musical damnation and wailing, doomed guitar.  An instant classic.         \\"Lover's Touch\\" brings to mind the Heartbreaker's hit \\"Breakdown,\\" with a heavier glaze.  This is where we can see the sense in undertaking Mojo--this stuff is the bedrock of their music.  The dreamy \\"Trip to Pirate's Cove\\" is one of Petty's hypnotic down-tempo tunes a la \\"Night Driver\\" and \\"Face in the Crowd,\\" et al.  And then, well, there's reggae... Yes, the herbal \\"Don't Pull Me Over\\" is, I believe, Petty's first Jamaican-style jam, and not bad if you can get past that.      Penultimately (before the closing statement of \\"Good Enough\\"), Petty serves us a down-to-earth song that echoes \\"Learning to Fly.\\"  Displaying his most natural gift, \\"Something Good Coming\\" is the hopeful fable of which he is always capable, no matter the year of release.  Is TP rock's Hans Christen Anderson?  He seems to create his contemporary fairy tales effortlessly; always familiar and archetypal, always equal parts simple and good.      Mojo is the guitar album the heretofore jangle-pop Heartbreakers have never made.  You're sure to hear Allman Brothers comparisons, valid since both bands share fiery guitar duels sweating out North Florida swamp water.  And certainly, Petty's 2008 resurrection of his first band Mudcrutch had a hand in this.  There may never be another hit-laden Full Moon Fever, but ask yourself, how often do we get to watch a mature band get better?  This just doesn't happen, and it's our pleasure.  It's steroidal Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens turning back the clock--but embrace this one, because there are no performance-enhancing drugs for musicians.  Well, there are, and we celebrate that.  But that's not what's at play here; it's something deeper and more rewarding.  This is their mojo we're talking about.

He is like a fusion of all of my pals into a single personality, and I found the writing hugely entertaining, at turns hilarious, wistful, charming, empathic, playful,and at times heart breaking.  I cannot imagine that anyone who has been a dog owner, and who is not totally jaded, would not love this story. I would recommend it without reservation it to anyone, dog owner or not.

0345505387|5.0|I have to start out saying that some of these negative reviews on here honestly make me laugh! You guys call yourselves fans of Diana Gabaldon? That is just laughable. It's one thing to have a few \\"issues\\" with it, it is 100% understandeable that you may not love it.....But to trash it when you didn't even know what you were buying and don't know anything about graphic novels, how they work and how the illustrations are done?!? It is ridiculous and only shows how uninformed you are. That's like getting mad at a kitten because it meows!     It's a shame that Diana and Hoang put their heart and soul into this and then get a bunch of clowns giving 1 star reviews out of the gate!    As for my official review - I loved it! Every piece of it - the story was a wonderful edition to the series and the artwork was breathtaking. I've been reading comics since I was a child and I was so thrilled to find out this was in the works but then again I'm such a big fan that Diana could write something on a piece of toliet paper and draw stick figures and I'd read it. I think Hoang Nguyen did a great job bringing these characters that we love so much to life.     Thanks to both of you for this and I really do love it and am happy to add it to my Outlander collection!

B003AO1SVS|5.0|The Black Keys gone glam?  \\"Everlasting Light,\\" catchy in its clap-stomp bounce from the get-go, is pure T-Rex redux.  Its falsetto vocals and perfectly dumb couplets (\\"Sun/when there is none,\\") are set off by sexy shushes.  This does not mark a one-tune detour.  On glammed-up \\"Howlin' for You,\\" trebly fuzz guitar needles through a sliding tempo tribute to Gary Glitter and bleachers-quaking rock.  The percussion (Carney's kit drives both the song and album) overpowers anything besides the mindless sing-along chorus, but apparently there's some baseball innuendo in there.       Brothers seems to look forward by looking back.  A Motown/soul revival shows on \\"Unknown Brother,\\" the Jerry Butler cover \\"Never Gonna Give You Up,\\" and the closer \\"These Days.\\"  Period piece gems, each, with strikingly un-Keysian touches: delicate glockenspiel on \\"Days\\"; sleigh bells on \\"Brother\\" that jingle under the radar until the other instruments drop out for a moment of what Weezy would call \\"letting the beat build.\\"       And at that hip reference, I'm reminded of the vertiginous new-found breadth of this supposed raw blues duo--there is even hip hop here.  \\"Too Afraid to Love You,\\" built around a steely, Wu-Tangish harpsichord loop, reveals the influence of Wu producer extraordinaire RZA, with whom Auerbach teamed on the rap-blues experiment album Balckroc between 2008's Attack & Release and Brothers.  The miracle is that \\"Too Afraid\\" sits just fine--maybe even unnoticeably--within this record's 15-track sequencing.    Of course, you have your good old dirty electric blues, too.  The Keys didn't throw out their signature sound with all this aural manifest destiny.  They've got all their swagger on \\"Next Girl,\\" who will be nothing like their \\"ex-girl\\", and Auerbach makes sure to unspool a crunchy guitar lick as the song expires. (Side note, check out this one's awesome viral video--a Playboy grotto's worth of girls poolside and a lip-syncing dinosaur hand puppet.  Just imagine.)  The strong-melodied \\"Ten Cent Pistol\\" sounds like Screamin' Jay Hawkins on \\"I Put a Spell on You,\\"--spooked-out 50s blues.     \\"Black Mud\\" is just that--Zeppelin sludge, organic, thick, stirred by blues guitar as an organ holds séance.  The album's only instrumental, it allows the listener to focus on its chunky texture and swirl of tone colors; offbeat, it's a subtle fast-favorite.  The following track \\"The Only One\\" takes that same sonic mud and shapes it into a pretty-chorused earthwork chapel, but it could probably benefit from truncation--it's basically the same musical phrase for five minutes.  Conversely, though, that repetition is hypnotic--you wouldn't suggest editing down the Beatles' \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy),\\" would you?      And then you've got \\"She's Long Gone,\\" which I can only describe as great filler.  Good rhythm, decent verses, anonymous chorus, overlaying a solid riff: just the (great) boilerplate blues we're used to.  But where Brothers really shines is the few spots they nail the blend of old and new.  \\"Sinister Kid\\" is a Beck-like amalgamation, catchy, weird and smart.  It's a beat that could be rapped over, kicked off with a James Brown grunt; danceable but still musically legit.  There's even a country-tinged solo to put the lid on this mostly funked-up cut.  The other high note is the lead single, \\"Tighten Up,\\" a mix of Sixties pop and Keys blues (guest-producer Danger Mouse).  You're hooked from the first damn whistle of the intro.  Oriental-flavored guitar interludes, customary irresistible clichéd lyrics, and a burbling breakdown tempo shift to the second half will fill your heart with amplifier distortion.          You couldn't ask much more of a white blues guitar-drum duo in 2010--maybe less, as the album runs fairly long.    There's nothing here to rival the pure rawness of 2004's Rubber Factory, but credit the Black Keys for not rehashing their successful formula and instead serving up this alchemy of remarkably fresh retro styles.And they're still your go-to for re-creating the genesis of dirty rock.  As the Boston Globe said of Danger Mouse-produced Attack & Release, \\"Cleaning up the boys won't stop them from tracking mud all over the house.\\"

B000MTOLDG|5.0|This is one of the mighty Motorhead's best albums.  At the time of the release the record label was going under and this CD was very hard to find.  Only years later did it receive the proper homage that it so justly deserves.  There are so many good songs on here, well, basically this is just a classic.  Beginning with 'On Your Feet or On Your Knees', and 'Burner', both which just tear it up with blistering fast riffage and the growling, spit-fire rasp of Lemmy; you know there are only good things to come.  Other hilights are 'I am the Sword', 'Lost In the Ozone', 'Liar', and 'Devils'.  But they're all good.  This is a must-have for any novice or die-hard metal head.  I'm still blown away by how good this CD is almost 20 years later.  I think I'll be listening to this when I'm 77, and hopefully beyond.  God Bless Lemmy, Phil, and Mikkey.

0307577589|5.0|I am an \\"audiophile.\\"  Since listening to my first audio book, I've been hooked.  This entire series is magnificantly written,extremely entertaining and well researched.  Usually, if I see a movie before I read a novel, I'm not inclined to read it afterwards.  This was the exception.  The Swedish version of the movie was so well done, that it made me want to know the characters, especially Lisbeth, even better.  The novel did not disappoint.  The reader is extremely talented and makes the books even more interesting. I understand they're planning an American version of this novel.  It's difficult to imagine that the original could be improved upon.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|This is a review of the KINDLE edition of Game of Thrones, which is a wonderful fantasy novel, a sort of brutal, medieval soap opera.<br /><br />The Kindle Edition, however, has so many typos as to detract from the experience. It is clear from the nature of the typos that they are the result of an innacurate OCR process. (In many cases \\"m\\"s were mistaken for \\"rn\\"s, etc.)<br /><br />Game of Thrones is a 5-star novel which has been given a 2-star Kindle treatment.
B003IWOVN4|5.0|Ben L'Oncle Soul is an artist to watch.  I don't speak French, but even the French songs on this album are a great listen.  The vocals are smooth and oh so cool.  The music is reminiscent of Motown but with a modern approach.  It's a shame the rest of the world doesn't know about this music yet.  I would hope it's just a matter of time.  Since it's only available as an import cd right now, it costs a bit more, but I think it's well worth it.  The cover of The White Stripes song, Seven Nation Army, would make the album worth it all by itself. The rest of the album sounds just as good though.  Fans of the classic Motown sound, buy this album right now.
0525951652|1.0|Being a fan of the previous two Follett's books, I wouldn't buy this one at this price.  Please educate me any reason other than greed that can make an ebook more expensive to manufacture and distribute than a hardcover.  This publisher is now in the hall of shame.
630542828X|5.0|Based on a True Story.  The best legal thriller of all time?  My vote for best film of 1998, and one of the finest of the decade.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I'll never pay $20 for a digital file, not when the book is selling for less....lost a sale and a reader...
1416550550|4.0|Kate Morton has written an intriguing, and haunting book in \\"The Forgotten Garden\\". This is a saga in the true sense, the story of 3 women, all searching for family.<br /><br />In 1913, a tiny girl is abandoned on a ship by her companion, \\"The Authoress\\". Lost and alone she ends up sitting on a dock in Australia, where she is taken in by a dockman and his family. The only clue to her identity is a small white suitcase.<br /><br />In 1975 a woman travels from Australia to England and impulsively buys a small but charming cottage on a large estate. She plans to make it her new home, but she never returns.<br /><br />In 2005 a young woman inherits the cottage and is determined to discover the answers to the many questions surrounding her family history.<br /><br />This was a wonderful book, spanning 4 generations of motherless girls. The stories are woven together so skillfully, I found myself disappearing into them. Secrets are revealed, love is found and lost, envy and bitterness, permeate one life, and in the end, answers are revealed in a very satisfying way.<br /><br />The characters were so richly drawn, I cared about ALL of the women, and I HAD to know what was next. The descriptions were wonderful, a travelogue for me, and it was one terrific trip.<br /><br />This book is from my very own shelf!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I have to admit I've sometimes paid a little more than $9.99 for a Kindle book because of the ease of having it instantly.  I will never pay $19.99.
B00005O3VD|5.0|Glad to update from VHS to DVD so I can watch one of the best movies and sing great songs anytime I want!
B00003CXWV|5.0|Blow is such a great story. I can't even begin to describe the awesomeness of this film. It has a compelling storyline and the acting is wonderful.
0385342047|5.0|This book is a great read.  Once again Sophie Kinsella delivers.  I loved the first book in the series and amazingly, each book is even better than the one before.  Mini Shopaholic continues the adventures of Beckly Brandon nee Bloomwood, family and friends.  I don't want to spoil the fun, so I won't go into details.  I was often laughing out loud at the situations Becky gets into.  One example, is the expedition with Minnie and Nanny Sue.  The book ends with mention of Becky, Luke and Minnie's next adventure.  I hope Sophie Kinsella intends to continue the saga.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This story is great. Larsson really knows how to tell a story. His writing is absoulutely flawless and it keeps you highly entertained. I could not put this book down for a second.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Hearing the music on my Zune everyday makes me wish I could see Wicked again soon!! The music is GREAT!
B003EPPEP4|5.0|First saw Nikki Yanofsky on the Huckabee show.  Was very impressed at how the young lady had such poise and grace singing these \\"old\\" songs.  She has great energy in her delivery and I look forward to more from this rising star.
B0044430H8|4.0|Yes, this album is similar to Ghosts because it's ambient and instrumentals, but 2 of the tracks on this record ARE from Ghosts. \\"Magnetic\\" is Ghosts II-14 and \\"A Familiar Taste\\" is Ghosts IV-35.    This soundtrack is still enjoyable, especially if you are a fan of Trent's work. However, I would highly suggest giving Ghosts a listening to if you've never heard it before and liked this. Ghosts is more exciting than most of the tracks on this album.
030745455X|5.0|This series is absolutely brilliant. Larsson is an excellent writer who knows how to tell a story. These books are so addicting that you won't be able to put this down.
0307454541|1.0|This book has graphic sexual violence. If you want to see how disgusting humans can be, this book gives you an idea. I wish there was a rating system or some way to let readers know what questionable material a book contains.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I received the product promptly and was exactly as advertised.  I am completely satisfied with this purchaes.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I have not read the books in this series, and I was not familiar with the author.  Having said this, I would have reated the movie as a 2+.  I didn't dislike it, but it didn't quite make it to \\"liking it\\".  I don't think, in fact, that I would read the books now, except they were spoken of highly in these other reviews.  My critique:  1. The acting was weak.  Percy was almost credible and that was about it.  2. The story had way too many holes in it (e.g.  Percy & his mom lived with a smelly grotesque bum - is that the best option?  The guy smells and masks Percy's demi-god odors.  That's pathetic).  3. The story line pushed sexuality - it didn't need to.  4. The story didn't flow well.  It was like watching a video game jump from one task to complete to the next.  I got bored pretty quickly and just sped up the DVD to get through it.  e.g.  It never explained why Percy presumably stole the lightening from Zeus and why he was suspect)    Having said all this, I can say it's worth watching if you don't have to pay to do so.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|No way am I going to get an e-book at this price!  I hope to read this book someday.  If I don't that's okay because there's so many other e-books out there for Kindle at a more realistic price.
0596806027|4.0|HTML5: Up and Running doesn't pretend to be a comprehensive exploration of HTML5, nor is it aimed at absolute-newbie web developers.     It serves as a conceptual overview of the new features in HTML5 -- just enough to get any web dev or site designer oriented on what can be done, with just enough code samples to encourage further exploration. Along the way, the author offers handy tricks for simplifying the HTML5 workflow and tips on avoiding conflicts with older, less powerful *COUGH*IE*COUGH* browsers.    If you know your way around previous versions of HTML and you're not afraid of the DOM, this book will get your boots on the ground and ready for more.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|When I first heard the songs I was really disappointed they sounded so different.  After listening to the songs a few times I cannot stop listening to them.  The band is just maturing.  You cannot expect a band to sound the same for almost a decade.  All musicians evolve.     Another recent artist that has matured is Eminem.  His last album sounds completely different from his earlier and and even recent work, yet it rocks!  Give this album a chance, you will appreciate it.
B003NX76BM|1.0|To preface, I want to say that I have enjoyed many Nora Roberts' books.  I particularly enjoy the suspense/mystery ones mixed with romance.  Now, it's clear to me after reading this book that Nora is putting out way too much stuff and either no longer has a decent editor, or is simply allowed to ignore their advice.    If you read this book you will learn a lot about dog training.  Really.  That's what Nora talks about for pages and pages and pages.  Basically she is saying \\"I did a lot of research on dog training and I'm going to put it in my book to sound authentic\\" but it only makes it more fake and as far from a romance novel as you can get.    All this time spent with the dogs is, of course, time we don't spend with the main characters--particularly the male lead who is pretty hollow and not particularly interesting or compelling.  The relationship is overshadowed by the endless dog training and the female lead is far too Mary Sue.  The ending is abrupt and not particularly satisfying.  If the author had spent a tenth of the time writing the ending as she did exploring all the aspects of dog training, it might have helped.    I'm so disappointed with this book as it signals to me that Nora Roberts' no longer cares about a good story and that she will simply keep producing as much junk as possible because people will buy it solely based on the sucess of her previous books.    Nora, you should be ashamed of this one.
