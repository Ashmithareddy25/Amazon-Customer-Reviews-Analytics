B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|This is a cool game. You have to save your friends by cutting the spider's web, but choose carefully ... with each cut, the spinders get closer to getting your friends. Suggest you play this on a Kindle, as a phone display can be hard to work on.

B00ARFEQ80|3.0|Being a huge fan of the 'Resident Evil' movies since the beginning, I started collecting them in Steelbook after 'Extinction' was released. I was happy with the quality and value in the previous titles, but it seems these are going the way that most other products tend to, which means cheaper quality for higher price. I know the earlier titles were much heavier, higher quality, actual METAL covers, which is what the title 'Steelbook' would imply. But this one, and the last also, have been very thin, flimsy sort of covers that do not even feel metallic anymore. Add to that the fact they stopped adding the second 'Bonus Disk' to these, making it just a plain old 1-disk Blu-Ray movie, and I don't think it is worth the $40 I paid at ALL. But, you don't mess with serious collectors, and sometimes we're willing to overlook extra cost just so we can have a 'matching set'...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book I l LOVE this series. Suzanne did an awesome job writing these books and I love reading them
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I would recommend this book to any readers of historical fiction. It gives a great insight into the events of World War One. Looking forward to Book 2
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|Movie: This movie is in my Top 5. It's just so whimsical, imaginative and fun. It makes you cry from happiness and you smile almost the entire film. Am&eacute;lie plays a matchmaker to random Parisians and goes on a journey or self-discovery that she can't stay introverted and alone. You must watch it. I mainly made this review to state some issues on the Blu-ray...<br /><br />Blu-ray quirks: This Blu-ray does not allow you to press Top Menu or Pop-Up Menu (or anything) during any of the trailers, company promos, etc. The only button that you can press is the Skip forward button, which takes quite a while if you Blu-ray player is older like mine. The blu-ray that I purchased from Amazon does have a menu when you finally get to it that does have a Setup menu, unlike another reviewer mentioned... It has the standard Play, Setup, Scenes, and Special Features, but is not intuitive. It makes you press the left arrow to escape out of menus and doesn't have any explanation onscreen. All of the menus move when you move your cursor and it's just hard to use.<br /><br />Blu-ray: The movie is beautiful in HD, sounds great with the dts-ma hd 5.1 French audio. It even has a dts calibration tool and dts-hd trailer that I have not seen on any other Blu-ray. I have owned this on DVD from long ago and now finally Blu-ray. It's well worth being in anyone's library!

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This movie not only has great cast, but includes extra features we enjoyed seeing after the movie. The movie is based on a family with hardships and situations anyone could experience. Funny times and tear dripper times. A movie all should see when age appropriate. Glad we purchased it to see more than once and even again after we have had it a year.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|As a fan of Marilyn it was a must see movie! It tells another view of her life, glad I bought it to see again.
B0055OMBIU|5.0|As a large family, this was an exciting educational building puzzle we did together!  We did not stick the layers or buildings though, in fear we do not know what to do for keeping. It is still out for display after a year and we hate to put it in the box. Look forward to seeing them do a few more of our favorite cities so we can collect a few more.
B004DM0UII|5.0|A very good app. Since it's a premium app, there are no commercials which by itself is worth the money
B00APUQRPC|5.0|In this film lives diverge when a mother dies leaving the father to raise a child alone. It is the epitome of what happens when parents don't communicate with their child and how that can change both of their lives forever.  A must see.

B005EGXNLS|5.0|So many Cornwell books....so little time!  None of them miss for me.  I was introduced to the author by a friend of mine.  His style, command of the subject matter, approach...all make the reading a pleasurable distraction from the modern world awhile helping us to understand the world as it was centuries ago.
0307719219|5.0|I'm not a historian, or an economist, so perhaps it isn't perfect in either of those aspects. I wouldn't know.  I found no inconsistencies with my current knowledge that were great enough to make me head for Google.  The complexities of those intersections traversing four hundred or so years is covered quite well.  I'm also reasonably sure that any book trying to undertake these two massive topics simultaneously in less than 600 pages is going to have to leave a whole lot out.  I read books like this for thoughts and concepts, not accuracy to the last detail so if it does have some historical inaccuracies, they do not put me off. The work is solid by any standards save a dedicated historian or history buff.  This book is absolutely loaded with great things to think about and research.  It presents circumstances and actions in a different light, explains them from a different perspective, and one that feels solid and consistent. I listened to it on Audible but will be buying a hard copy for my library.  It left me wondering exactly where America is today against the ruler of \\"inclusive.\\"  It also made me come to terms with, for the very first time, the true meaning of the concept of slavery - and in that understanding, I realized it's far more widespread than most people realize or give voice to.  The words might not be the same but for all of the history of man, it has always been about exploitation of the many by the few - it's just a matter of degrees.  With my plump bottom nestled into a cushy chair behind my cherrywood desk, it's hard to feel slavish BUT when you realize 3% of the people in our crony capitalism driven world own 97% of the wealth, it's time to re-evaluate. To the human brain, everything is relative.  Must we live exactly as those who built the pyrimids, those in the concentration camps, or those on Southern plantations, to be called \\"slaves?\\"  If you labor but get little from it while others labor not, yet get much, aren't you pretty much there?  Where, exactly, is the United States on that curve.  I'm reading another book on my Kindle called \\"The End of Growth.\\"  These two have been great companions. Those are some of the questions I bought this book to help me answer, and it did exactly what I needed it to do. Out of the 100 - 120 business oriented books I'll read in 2013, I'll be surprised if this doesn't end up in the top 5.  After having read hundreds, perhaps more than a thousand books, most present me with little that lingers.  This book lingers.Where, exactly, is the United States on that curve.

1423136802|5.0|My daughter in law and I have both read this series and we both loved it.  She loved it enough that she wanted a full set so I ordered this for her for Christmas.  She is very pleased with it.  Some stories you just want to read over and over again.  This would be one of them.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I purchased this to help keep my daughter entertained during her brother's swim practice.  It's a great game however it is much too easy to buy extra money.  Without my knowledge, she spent $30!!!!  And all within 10 minutes.  Buyer beware!
B008QMMEOE|4.0|Challenging but fun.  Four stars because the puzzle piece will zip back if not fairly perfect placed when released.  Other puzzles allow the pieces to be moved around and adjusted uuntil perfectly placed.
B00APUQKDG|4.0|Overall I thought it was a good movie. The acting was excellent and they really did a good job of bringing the story to life. The main reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I felt that it lacked the nuance of the book. They told the story, and it was faithful to the book for the most part, but it felt like it sort of glossed-over some of the intricacies that gave the book a lot of depth.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Older animated movie, but the kids still love it.  Heartwarming story, good movie to pop in on a rainy day..
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie made the story line in the Alien series much clearer.  NOW I get the fuller picture. Good movie
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I put this on my new Kindle so my Grandkids would have a game that they could play when we are together.  They love this.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I had viewed this on HBO a few years back.  It has stuck in my mind, so when the price was right I got my copy.  I wish all history had this personal touch.  My husband viewed this for the first time, and really liked it.

I decided that she needed a Katniss Everdeen doll to sit beside the Jane Austen doll I got her two years ago.  She is a literature buff and loves her reminders of some of her favorite books.
B007C3TVNA|4.0|In light of the tragic shootings in Colorado and Connecticut, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is particularly relevant and disturbing.<br />Director Lynne Ramsay pilots an uncompromising film without assigning or denying blame.  Some times the non-linear structure is disarming but by the movie's end, all the pieces fall together.<br />Watching KEVIN is often uncomfortable as we soon realize a happy ending is not in the cards.  KEVIN poses the time-honored debate involving nurture vs. nature:  is Kevin born bad or has his parents lack of proper guidance and alleged abuse created a monster?  This question remains a viewer's perception.  I tend to feel it's a combination of both.<br />Tilda Swinton is deservedly a Golden Globe nominee for her devastating portrayal as Kevin's mom.  John C. Reilly offers an understated performance as the passive father.  Ezra Miller and the two younger Kevins are frighteningly chilling.<br />KEVIN admittedly packs a powerful punch and may be a little too intense for impressionable youngsters.
0307949486|5.0|Haven't read book yet, but will read it soon, thanks for your interest in my review.  Check back with me in a few weeks.
0525423656|2.0|Before I begin commenting on CROSSED, the 2nd book in the [[ASIN:0525426264 Matched Trilogy]] by Ally Condie, I'll preface my review by saying that it's been two years since I read the first book.  And in that time period, I read [[ASIN:B004XJRQUQ The Hunger Games Trilogy]].  I had forgotten what had all happened in [[ASIN:014241977X Matched]] and how it ended.  So jumping into CROSSED, I figured I'd get a little refresher course and everything would come back to me.  Not so.  I remember the basics, but in starting CROSSED, I felt like I missed something between books one and two.<br /><br />In CROSSED, the main character, Cassia, joins a rebellion to go up against the Society.  Sound familiar?  It should.  It's the same awful \\"plot\\" of The Hunger Games' [[ASIN:B0095GSE9E Mockingjay]].  I immediately felt like I was back in The Hunger Games' Panem where the land was divided into districts, the Capitol ruled all, and the people were trying to free themselves of its rule by staging boring protests.  Yawn.<br /><br />What happened to Cassia being \\"matched\\" to her future husband but being in love with someone else?  What happened to her relationships with friends and family?  Like Mockingjay, CROSSED forgoes character development with the hopes of keeping readers' attention by adding \\"suspense.\\"  That is, if suspense is defined as the author's boredom with the plot and the story's characters.<br /><br />CROSSED feels a bit too much like Mockingjay in that the author needed to produce something (anything) to her editor and publisher in order to keep the trilogy (and sales) going.  I was so disinterested in beginning the book that it wasn't until the eighth chapter that I realized that the chapters were alternating points of view!  This is a big change from MATCHED, which was written entirely from Cassia's point of view.  No wonder I was so confused and didn't care what was going on.  Whatever was happening was happening to two different characters!  That meant two boring storylines were going on at once!<br /><br />UGH.  Seventy five pages in, I had to put the book away before I threw it against the wall.  Now, I can't even touch [[ASIN:B007FEFDFQ Reached]], the third book in the trilogy.  It's a shame.  The author could have written something SO much better.  She has the talent to be a decent writer, but she gave that up when she offered CROSSED as a follow-up to MATCHED.storylines were going on at once!<br /><br />UGH.

B000VZYPB4|3.0|The show is great, but I bought season 1 through the PS3 Amazon App for a marathon with a friend. It was slow to load the first episode and had to stop to cache once in the middle, but the next few episodes didn't have any problems. However then episode 8 wouldn't play - I just got the annoying orange circling thing. Thinking it was just taking a long time to cache, I waited 10 minutes before switching back to the main menu. I then saw that episode 8 was listed as &#34;watched&#34; with 10 minutes of the program already passed. So while I had been watching the orange circle, Amazon thought I was watching the show. This happened again with another episode, then the next few I tried refused to play at all. I logged all the way out of the program and back in with the same result. I even switched to something else (Netflix) for an hour, and came back to watch the next TBBT episode, but it still woulndn't play. By being incredibly persistent, I&#34;ve managed to watch all but 1 episode of Season 1. Like I said, the show is great, but the delivery is miserable.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|You have to suspend belief, but this movie equates to an enjoyable, campy popcorn flick.  The 3D is well-done, and the premise of Lincoln as a vampire hunter brings back remembrances of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Not serious, but definitely fun.
B00APUTEBG|3.0|It was not a bad movie; it was not an exceptional movie.  The movie moved at a nice pace but the storyline was not original and somewhat predictable.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|We have lost pictures and documents to computer crashes. I guess everyone has to learn the hard way at least once. We've tried external hard drives, which eventually quit working just like a computer. We've tried loading data onto multiple thumb drives which are easy to misplace. I learned about the cloud drives and chose Amazon because I'm pretty sure Amazon is not going to be going away and taking my data with it. Amazon is just reliable in my mind. I set it up, uploaded some pics from my android phone, then uploaded pics and documents from my laptop. It works like a charm and is not at all difficult to work with. It will be quite awhile before we need more than the 5 GB of free storage space. Can't beat the price!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|What's not too like?  This movie has lots of action and also tickles the funny bone.  Besides Cruise, the cast includes Jeremy Remmer and Simon Peg.  The latter provides most of the funny stuff.  This is a movie lovers movie.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|who doesnt like games like this, a lot of fun to play when you have down time and you are bored
B0096HID5M|3.0|I think this probably worked better as a stage play.  That said, the music is worth sitting through the movie and I can't believe Tom Cruise pulled off this part.  Who knew the dude can sing?  He is Stacee Jax.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|these types of games are always difficult to master but after a lot of practice you can start landing the plane with relative ease
B005K17RU0|5.0|When we are home or gone I love this as I can see the weather all over it is great for driving I can see what maybe up ahead for the weather be it a snow storm or rain
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|I didn't want to rent this movie because I believe the first totall recall was fantastic. Although I don't even like Arnold but the movie was first rate. This one on the other hand and except for the special effects, was very drab! I don't recommend it as a good movie for sure.
B00A3T5CGU|5.0|I've only used this a few times but really liked it. I'm planning on using it again and again soon.
B0091REZMW|4.0|You will like this game if you like a challenge . You may also need to like finding hidden objects. Which is where the mystery comes into play.  It gets addicting.  Which is why I enjoy  playing this game. I've enjoyed playing this game.
B009DT98RK|5.0|Saw Frampton live a couple of years ago and just had to have this when it came out!  Sound and video quality is very good.  Packaging is just a cardboard sleeve instead of the usual plastic BluRay case.
0765325950|5.0|When a great author writes a book it should be for everyone first. Not just the select few who can only handle purchasing for the electronic readers. Most of the world reads books and the publishers should consider that first. Then after this has done is round then it can be published electronically for those who have electronic readers.<br />Please just get used to it as that is what is current in the world!!!!
1423124960|5.0|Bought these for my 4 yr old daughter for xmas...he loves them, and each story is the perfect length for a bedtime story (10mins?). The quality is great, pictures are colorful and well done. All in all a great purchase.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|My grandson had been wanting this game so we purchased it for him for Christmas.  It is now a family favorite!  My daughter<br />says they've been playing it as a family almost every evening now!  Loved by the boys and adults as well.
1452110581|5.0|Oh my stars. I've never read anything as smirk worthy as this. There isn't anything offensive or even mildly challenging in this tomb of wise cat humor. You'll almost grin out loud. This book completely blows away Garfield and reveals him to be unimaginative, negative, and a downright frowny puss. This book shows us exactly how smart we always knew our cats were and brings us into their cuddly fuzzy world of wisdom. They really give us paws to think! You'll die of cute!
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book is the best book I've ever read, it's so well written and made me feel so close with the main character. I am so interested in the lives of all the characters and wish I could know more about all of them. I cried several times, and felt so connected with Francie Nolan.  I now understand why this book is held in such high regard among many people I know.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I love this movie.  It's absolutely hilarious and I got it on a Black Friday Lightening Deal, so it was impossible to pass up!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Oh. my.......&#34;Hopeless&#34; had me breathless.....had me gripping the sides of the emotional roller coaster anxiously waiting for the next curve, the next steep hill, the next twist and all the while holding my breath and screaming for more.  Sky and Holden's fate was written in the stars...Bravo!
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a really great movie and it was on sale for under $2 during Black Friday, so it was definitely worth the buy!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an amazing book, one of the best I have read in a long time. Very sad but still great!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|well written show and good acting.  has a little of everything, suspense; romance; action!  What else could you ask for?
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart & Christmas, what more could a girl want.  He's terrific.  You should add this CD to your Christmas music collection.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the writing.  And the actors who deliver the lines flawlessly.  And the  beautiful costumes and scenery.  Maggie Smith and her one liners are perfection.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|This is a fun bunch of jiggley puzzle pieces that you have to get together,some how, someway, without crashing off into oblivion!
B00993FEUK|4.0|This was a a gift for my 5 year old son.<br />None of us had any real opinion about wanting to see the movie, it was more of an impulse buy on my part.<br />He is a Fan of Lego's monster fighters, was a \\"scary\\" vampire for Halloween, so I know he leans towards liking the \\"kid scary\\" stuff.<br />It has turned out to be a frequently requested watch by my son!<br />I will point out it may it can have a couple of \\"morbid\\" parts that sensitive kids may not enjoy but overall in our house it is a hit.<br />My son was even enamored by the DVD features showing how they made the movie.
0439023491|5.0|Good trilogy. I enjoyed the writing and imagination.. Just didnt care for the concept of children being put into a violent game

B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book starts out a little slow..But wonderful learning alot about zoology & Theology. I did like the ending.. Makes you think..
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game so much! Totally addicted! Need to go and play it now before bedtime. If you have not tried it you need to.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Let me start by saying I like Star Wars everything and I am excited for the new movies 7-9.  I know there are purists out there who don't like the prequels, don't like updating the originals in any way and wish the 4-6 could be released in original form.  I respect and appreciate those opinions but I am not that person, I like the stories of 1-6 equally and I really like seeing the improved pictures on the Blu Rays.  I grew up on 4-6 and I was excited for 1-3 when those came out. I know there must be a few people like me out there or they wouldn't sell many of the Blu Rays.  Picture and sound is really good.  I would recommend these for people who love Star Wars are ok with upgrades and some changes.  *This is the same review I gave for the prequels on Blu Ray and I feel the same about both sets so I duped this review.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|A visually stunning CG world and a stellar line up of great actors just weren't enough to save this clunker of a remake. All in all, a so-so re-imagining of the original with a surprisingly tame and seemingly sudden ending.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I stumbled upon Florence + The Machine only recently and Ceremonials was my first album.  I loved that one so much that I picked up this one too.  I really like Lungs as well, there isn't a bad song on the whole album.  I love when I can buy a cd and the all of the songs are good.  Great sound, I would recommend.
1451695195|1.0|To much about the coma and to little about the experience. If I were not a believer this certainly would not convince me. Have read much more detailed and interesting NDEs.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Let me start by saying I like Star Wars everything and I am excited for the new movies 7-9.  I know there are purists out there who don't like the prequels, don't like updating the originals in any way and wish the 4-6 could be released in original form.  I respect and appreciate those opinions but I am not that person, I like the stories of 1-6 equally and I really like seeing the improved pictures on the Blu Rays.  I grew up on 4-6 and I was excited for 1-3 when those came out. I know there must be a few people like me out there or they wouldn't sell many of the Blu Rays.  Picture and sound is really good.  I would recommend these for people who love Star Wars are ok with upgrades and some changes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read to finish off the series.  Saw the movie and glad I had read the books so I knew what was going on.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I am just getting into Florence + The Machine and this album is a great way to start.  I love all of the songs and I marvel at Florence's strong and beautiful voice.  It's refreshing to have a more unique sound and a great voice.  I would recommend.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters and the story sucked me right in.  All the performances were splendid, making one truly believe one was there!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved it! The characters, the plot, the dialogues, the hints to history and flashes of the story to come: I soon became enthralled by it. I heartily recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Quick read.  So exciting that you just want to finish the book, which is what I did in just<br /> a few days.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I had little expectations walking into LOOPER - the ad campaign was pathetic - but by the time it finished, I was blown away.  This has been a great year for scifi & fantasy and LOOPER's a big reason why.  Mix in equal helpings of BLADE RUNNER, SCANNERS, and TIME COP (plus a little WITNESS for seasoning) and you get a styled, original film that never bores.  While we've seen everything featured in LOOPER before in other films, we've never quite seen it put together quite like this.<br /><br />As written and directed by Rian Johnson, LOOPER never hesitates in it's far out plot - it's set in 2044 and the time travelers come from some 40 years later - so much so that the time travel gimmick becomes very believable (a very hard trick to pull off).  That's partly because there's plenty of other hardcore scifi gimmicks  - rayguns, flying cars, and psychic powers - also make appearances.  Despite all the chances for missteps, Johnson's direction is crisp and never chooses style before story, instead letting the action dictate the camera work.<br /><br />The film's helped by a great cast - Bruce Willis is great of course, but so is Jeff Daniels as a mob boss, as is Joseph Gordon Levitt and Emily Blunt.  Very solid, very professional performances all the way around.  None of them get overwhelmed by a story that could have very easily turned into a farce.<br /><br />Far out plot aside, this movie works quite well as a detective story.  It also plays on our expectations of what we want from our Hollywood stars.  The music, camera work, costumes are all top notch.  Makeup plays a big role, as Levitt wears a \\"Bruce Willis\\" nose that doesn't always work, but that about the worst thing I can say about this otherwise must see flick.<br /><br />4 \\"Sweet! I didn't see that one coming\\" stars out of 5
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Great Movie, a little on the lengthy side but worth the time. The exciting, action filled, and filled with love and real life situation.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Never thought I'd like a sci-fi themed book but this one is so much more!  Great read sorry I waited so long to read them!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author and I have to say she is a great story teller.  I enjoyed this book and couldn't wait to see where it was going. I thought I had the book \\"figured out\\" as to who dunnit just short of the half way point.  Well, that wasn't the full picture, nor the full journey the book was going to take you on.  There were many other layers yet to go to my delight. And it certainly didn't end the way I thought it was going to.<br /><br />The book is about a couple who have been married for 5 years and have already run into the rut of not giving your all anymore. Amy and Nick have gone through some rough spots lately in losing their jobs.  Amy had a trust fund from her parents due to a series of books they wrote based on Amy more or less.  They end up having to give a good chunk of her trust fund back to her parents, and leaving them to move back to Nick's hometown to help with his sick parents.  Amy is a city girl, born and raised.  It's an adjustment for her to move to a small town that is on the decline.  There they use the last of their money to buy a bar in order for Nick to have some kind of job.  Things get even more stale for this couple.  Then Amy disappears....gone out of the blue.  Her disappearance is suspicious to say the least.  From there you will have to read the book to know the twists and turns the investigation takes.  How the story ends up, you'll be surprised.  Enjoy!
B001VLXNLU|3.0|Not too bad, the first four seem okay the authors repeat themselves way too much!  I know who the twins are, every time you introduce them to a new character you don't have to tell me again.. I got it, I'm reading the book! lol!.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|If you are a fan of the old 70's sci fi with no computer generated crap - you will enjoy this movie.  I am a big fan of the 70's disaster/sci fi movies and this is a good one.

B0000039Q3|1.0|Something went horribly wrong here.  As others have mentioned, several tracks have been altered.  Additionally, the packaging does not match the description.  This set does not have a gatefold cover.  Sides 1 and 2 bizarrely have the same track listing.  Is this a knockoff?

B0071XO8RA|4.0|A gripping read, with the plot not entirely transparent. Also, the ending could have been cheesy, instead left me wanting more.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is really great.  It is the best way I have seen with keeping<br />up with the weather.  It shows you quite a lot
B0074AGVWK|5.0|Alway enjoy reading her stories. The clever plots. the wonderful warming stories of human beings.  I always can picture the characters and feel like I'm there too.The interactions of the people is skilfully done. My only criticism is that it ended too soon -I could have gone on and on reading her magic tale. I highly recvommend as a good read -especially curled up on the sofa listening to the wind and rain outside.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Review from Goodreads.com:    ***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!! :D***    I cannot explain how wonderfully amazing this book is!!    I'm always nervous when it's time to write reviews, because I'm never sure I'll adequately express my feelings about it or whatever. But there is one thing that really struck me about this book that I kept thinking about while I was reading it, and that was how it started off so innocent and slowly spiraled out of control.    In the beginning the book seemed like just another girl meets bad boy type story, and I was thoroughly enjoying that. I was wondering how Sky would deal with Dean Holder, the guy who beat up that gay kid, the guy who was sent to juvi, the guy with anger management issues. I was intrigued to find out how their relationship would play out.    By the middle of the book, I realized that that wasn't what this story was about AT ALL. It's about a girl who was taken away from a sexually abusive household, trying to deal with the fact that there was a lot more to the life she thought she was living.    And the secrets just kept on COMING, right up until the very end - we continue to find out some other horrible thing that John has done, that Karen's his sister, Sky's aunt, that he'd done the same thing to Les - it was just continuously BLOWING. MY FREAKING. MIND. And I ABSOLUTELY LOVED every minute of it.    I also loved the way the characters interacted - their humor was spot on, and it reminded me of how I get on with my friends. I also liked that there was no slut-shaming of Six and Sky's \\"extracurricular activities\\" (besides the girls at school, but hey, that's how girls at school are). It was nice to see girls taking control of the sexual aspect of their lives without suffering unnecessary consequences for it.    Speaking of Six, that's just one thing I thought the book was missing - they were such best friends, but they hardly talked (although I can't really complain about this, I hardly talk to my bestie most of the time, so who am I to judge). I just felt Six was missing out, when she was such a constant presence in the beginning - but then again, that goes along with how the book went from \\"typical high school story\\" to \\"OH MY GOD THIS S*** CRAY\\". I guess I just would've liked to see Sky talk to Six and tell her everything. But, I guess those things take time, and that's just me :)    Loved this book!! It was wonderful, and I stopped reading it for a few days because I didn't want it to be over - but alas! It has ended. Highly recommended :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A true look at love, loss, and forgiveness. Learning to love again and start over. I could not put this book down and read it in less than two days. I would recommend this book to loyal Sparks fans and new Sparks fans alike looking to get hooked. A wonderful reading experience.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I actually read the physical book, not on my ereader.  That is what got me started reading the Lee Childs Reacher series.<br />I will say this, He is falling in the same rut John Grisham has. After much success they start to become too wordy in trying to increase the volume written words. I will probably change writers just find and interesting method of telling a story. Seems like when a writer gets a book on screen something happens to his (her) ego and writing skills.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My three daughters love playing this game. Very reasonable price for its quality. My kids don't seem to get bored of it.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I've been a big Ke$ha fan for the last couple of years.  I loved Animal, but I felt Cannibal really fell short.  I guess that wasn't her fault, but I had high hopes and much apprehension awaiting this release.  I was not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />I feel her material has progressed from &#34;full on raging party pop, and the mandatory hangover ballad&#34; to a very sincere, introspective, and gritty style all her own.  When she says it, she believes it.<br /><br />great songs<br /><br />Outstanding.  I was up until 4am last night trying to slap this out of my head.  It's that catchy.  The production is top-notch.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I am an over 60 male who was very out of shape. This serirs jump started my desire to work out. I did the aerobic routine 4 days a week with one of the specific body parts. It works!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|A few times it seemed like this was going to be a fifty shades of gray novel but I found I couldn't put the book down.  I'm so glad I didn't because the story is solid and keeps you needing to know what's next.<br /><br />It's easy to read, and a definite page turner.  I'm really glad I read this and will recommend it to others.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book. Relatable on many levels. Easy to read. Some may find it vulgar, but it is realistic. I didn't expect to like it, because I have high standards for truly liking a book, but I found it to be wonderful. Character depth, great story lines, and resolution.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I am not a fan of repeat viewings, but I do re-watch this every winter at our first snowfall. The soundtrack is so rich - it immediately puts me in a good place. I appreciate the loose graphic style. Sure, the big payoff is meeting Santa, but the focus is on the wildlife and even the parade of snowmen introduce cultural differences. It is beautiful in its simplicity.<br /><br />Meant only for children? Sure, if you say so, since I'm only 52... and a half.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very well written series.  i had to buy the next book immediatley after I finished one it was so good.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I choose 5 stars because I love this show.  Each season gets better and better. I can say that I am hooked!!!
B008XX6J92|5.0|This was collection of previously unreleased songs from 1967 to 2012 (what a career!) was worth waiting for. Such a voice she has ... maybe the only singer who can put a song from 1967 and another from 2012 on the same collection without a huge difference is vocal change. Her version of &#34;Try to Win a Friend&#34; could have been a #1 hit during the era of Linda Ronstadt and country/rock. Great.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 2 year loves puzzles and these are his favorite kind so I would recommend these to be the best on here as I've probably ordered/bought them all from this brand :)

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is currently my soon to be 4 year olds favorite show and is her favorite game it is perfect for her age as shes able to care for her pets on her own and doesn't get frustrated like other games that she would need my help with so this is def a 5 star game to us.. very cute.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book that haven't already been reiterated by others. I cried, I laughed, I was entertained & 100% engaged in the story. Well done!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first read the teaser I knew this could be good or very cheesy. I really enjoyed it. The characters were believable and like able. I found myself remembering what being \\"in lust\\" with someone felt like. A book that gives hope to victims of abuse that they may become sexually functioning adults.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I apologize for this review being similar to the one I wrote for Omnibus.  The stories are different, but the worst of mankind is the same. Review as follows:  In our uncertain world, the last thing I wish to read is a book that gives no hope.  The last thing I wish to read, is a book that blames one political party pure evil.  This is a book that attack your emotions and bring out the absolute horror of a political party that sees itself as the only salvation for a country, while making the opposition appear to be saints by not even being part of the story except to die.  The writer deserves 5 stars for being a very good psychological writer capable of pulling you along with his reality.  The story hardly deserves 3 stars for being so slanted, that a disturbed person, in real life, could point to this book and use it to justify brute force against anyone that doesn't think as they think.  I recommend reading with care and remember that anyone that believes he or she is the only person with the right answers or ideas, is the most dangerously destructive person of all.  Those types of people are not exclusively associated with only one group; one state; one country.  Those types of people are what do the most damage world wide.  It is well written.  If you choose to read it, I recommend that afterwards, you find one of those nice groups on youtube that &#34;mob&#34; and area just to bring a smile to anyone's face.  There are more good people in the world than bad.  I choose to have hope that the selfish bad will not destroy this world.

B00ARAN9JW|1.0|This one was my least favorite of all the RE movies. Not well done at all. Plot was not interesting and I wasn't interested in any of the characters.
B009329ZF2|1.0|Liam Neeson should be ashamed for having lent his name and face to this disaster, even if only for 10 minutes.<br /><br />The CG is great, but that's about it. The plot's not new and there was no acting of any note.<br /><br />I thought the idea of using actual veterans was cool, but then the rest of the movie was so not Navy. I give the veterans 5 stars and the movie 0.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I love this CD and this is actually the second time I purchased it. I can listen from track one to the end in the car, home or office. It's clean, sultry and blusey. Sweet  like a Brittish  Minnie Riperton without the high notes. Corinne is a true talent.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|I got this with a new motherboard and 32GB of memory. I have it mainly to use virtual machines on a a windows 8 OS. I won't get into Windows 8 changes that'll take forever. I can say this chip runs fine while running two vm's and the desktop at once. It is responsive and allows for plenty of power. I do not game so i can't speak to that. I do decryption sometimes and it handles this with easy. Bench marks are solid. I've used AMD for my builds for a decade and for the price it can't be beat.
B0001AP12G|5.0|No matter how many CD's Kanye makes this will probably always be my favorite.  Early Kanye, before all of the money and fame.  The package came fast (I love that) and the product was in great shape, especially for a &#34;used&#34; product.

B002BWQ6H6|2.0|I enjoy a book that has a plot and moves along.  This book was a very disjointed collection of stories. The single thread that tied them together was an illegal high wire walk between the two trade center towers in NYC.  If I had to say what the plot was, I'd say it is serendipity.  I thought the writing was wonderful and the characters believable, but the lack of a plot really hurts this book.
B006X50OPW|5.0|A great book to gain insight from experienced traders with different styles and perspectives. Great if you are looking to learn more about trading, and develop your own style.

0679809015|4.0|I gave this a 4 star rating because the book was way smaller than I anticipated but it's still a fun little book for kids to read and learn from. My son loves animals so this is a good way for him to learn the sounds of each animal and what they look like.

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great read for the WWII air war history buff. It is particularly interesting to get the story from the German fighter pilot's perspective, particularly from one so much a common  man yet so noble by his actions.  The story is disturbing in its subject matter as all war should be but ultimately uplifting in its message of humanity when madness reigns. 5 stars for its readability and realism.

B003WUYRGI|4.0|I dislike the way the book is set up. I would recommend this book to language teachers for s lesson. This book is very interesting.
B008Y6UND6|2.0|It's a lively dark movie with fabulous portrayals of characters who have HUGE meaning for fans and devotees of the book. The rest of us must pay very very close attention to catch what's actually going on, whom to sympathize with, and when it's going to end. It's long and forget the popcorn. It's violent  and ugly.
B009POHHRG|5.0|Great comic, can't wait to read the follow up comics. I enjoyed the illustrations. Great take on getting at the Batman.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|This, the Beatles' 3rd British release, opens with a chord of almost mystical power. So much so one could dub it the \\"Tristan Chord\\" of pop music. Some enterprising folks have reconstructed it from studio notes and other hints and found that more was going on in those few seconds than meets the cochlea. If anyone ever constructs a \\"best all-time album openings\\" list - or maybe someone already has - this harmonic yet dissonant kick to the brain would have to make the top 10.<br /><br />Time, which degrades and rots most things, hasn't seemed to wedge a dent in this or any other of the Beatles' masterpieces. The addictive rhythm, hooks, melodies and arrangements don't let up throughout this unforgettable collection of songs. Beatlemania already swept most of the western world and this album and accompanying film cranked the frenzy up a few more logarithmic notches. As films of the time show, many people writhed and screamed until nearly exploding while experiencing this music live. Just what made it so agonizingly appealing, almost drug-like, to such vast swarths of the population remains somewhat of a mystery. Marketing and media hype no doubt helped, but the music in this case pretty much justified the frenetic concrete-melting hype. Pop music has tried to recreate this hysteria numerous times with varied amounts of success. Though their popularity never really waned, \\"Hard Day's Night\\" arguably represents the absolute peak of the insanity.<br /><br />Like many of the Beatles' early releases, this one has a foot both in the past and the future. It has a lot of the raw rock energy of its predecessor, \\"With the Beatles,\\" though acoustic guitars seem to have a larger and more powerful presence here. They provide solid backbeats for \\"I Should Have Known Better,\\" \\"Things We Said Today\\" and \\"I'll Be Back.\\" Glimpses of \\"Rubber Soul,\\" though slight, emerge here and there. Each album, including their early releases, seem to build on the last. And they never stopped until they actually stopped only nine albums and six short years later.<br /><br />Those looking for the American Capitol release, also called the \\"Soundtrack\\" of the film, will not find it here. Many know that, up until \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" the Beatles' American releases differed greatly from their British ones. When the Beatles' catalog finally appeared on CD in the late 1980s, only the British releases appeared. The far more numerous American releases, split and \\"butchered\\" up for maximum profit, were only released on CD in a two-volume box set, but the Capitol \\"Hard Day's Night\\" was not included. So as of right now, vinyl seems the only option for the American version. And with CDs going the way of 8-tracks and cassettes, who knows if a CD release will ever see the light of day? Perhaps a downloadable digital version will appear?<br /><br />The Beatles of course have now become legend. Well, even more legend, if that's possible in their case. Sadly, only half of the band remains with us. Though whether legends stay legends past their time remains the judgment of succeeding generations, their popularity still hasn't seemed to have waned much throughout the past few decades. New releases still sell and the back catalog keeps getting remastered, not to mention \\"Guitar Hero.\\" Also, many who weren't even born when the band was active listen to them. In any case, whatever the future of music brings, which might include the death of the album itself, \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" will likely persevere as an example not only of pop culture mania, but solid and exquisitely performed pop music. Too bad George didn't get to write one here. At least they let him sing a bit.y actually stopped only nine albums and six short years later.<br /><br />Those looking for the American Capitol release, also called the \\"Soundtrack\\" of the film, will not find it here.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I almost deducted a point from my review because of all of the typos.  This book could really benefit from some editing, and the story is good enough to justify the effort.  There are a thousand &#34;in to&#34;s that need to become &#34;into&#34;, just one example.<br /><br />But I gave it five stars anyway because the story is so good that it doesn't matter that much.  Great job.  Worth reading, and definitely worth buying, at $1.
B009AZZEU2|4.0|After spending a decade helping to pioneer the Seattle grunge scene with landmark albums such as \\"Badmotofinger\\" and \\"Superunknown,\\" Soundgarden underwent a messy and bitter break-up (following the release of \\"Down On The Upside\\") in 1996. Still, the Seattle-bred hard rockers always seemed like a band that was ideal for a monumental reunion. And this is not only because Audioslave (the supergroup involving frontman Chris Cornell and three former members of Los Angeles rap-metal group Rage Against The Machine) dissolved, and Cornell explored a respectable but ultimately failed attempt at a solo career in the late Nineties/early 2000's. Well, following a messy and bitter break-up (following the release of \\"Down On The Upside\\") in 1996, Cornell and the boys did reunite, albeit after a very lengthy hiatus (one that lasted sixteen years, to be exact).<br /><br />\\"King Animal\\" is the group's first album in sixteen years. Therefore, it is perfectly fitting for Cornell to emphatically wail away -- in typical C.C. fashion -- \\"I've been away for too long!\\"over a meaty, staccato, lurching guitar hook from six-stringer Kim Thayil on the set's opener (\\"Been Away Too Long\\"). These thirteen songs may take more than one listen to sink in and absorb completely, but this is not a bad thing -- in fact, it shows signs of long-lasting quality. And sure, Cornell may sound a bit dated, as his voice does occasionally hint at being wrecked, but only occasionally. The vast majority of the time, he sounds great! Thus, all of the usual Soundgarden hallmarks -- Sludgy rhythms, drop D-tuned guitars, natural-sounding drums, heavy, rumbling bass lines, and stellar, soaring vocals -- are most certainly in place here, on \\"K.A.\\".<br /><br />Following the above-mentioned opener comes the surprisingly bass-driven \\"Non-State Actor,\\" which augments its typically glorious, wailing vocals with heavy, grumbling bass lines. And then \\"By Crooked Steps\\" a song that features not only more terrific -- and very memorable - singing,  but also catchy, bobbing, Led Zeppelin-esque guitar slices, an unorthodox and moderately tricky time-signature, and pleasantly surprising, polyrhythmic drumming, drops. Elsewhere, \\"A Thousand Days Before,\\" with its muscularly humming-yet-simultaneously melodic bass throb and irresistibly catchy vocals, and \\"Bones Of Birds,\\" with its warm, infectious, and at times almost soulful-sounding crooning, are both good and catchy enough to be potential hit/lead singles.<br /><br />\\"Blood On The Valley Floor\\" is another standout, on account of it being backed by a heavy, churning, Black Sabbath-esque riff, thus making it the record's heaviest song. And \\"Taree,\\" with its brief but awesome bit of noteworthy, wah-pedal/whammy-bar drenched guitar leads/soloing, also evokes Sabbath. And \\"Attrition,\\" a heavy and up-tempo rocker with deft drumming and really hooky and infectious, sing-song-y refrain (Cornell coos \\"Ooh, ooh\\" over and over again) is another. Other highlights include \\"Halfway There,\\" which is an acoustic ballad, and quite possibly the album's sweetest moment; and the really trippy, proggy, ethereal, and Jimi Hendrix-influenced \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\", and the Deep Purple-reminiscent closer \\"Rowing,\\" both of which have memorable vocal patterns, and plenty of exceptional, wailing, and epic-sounding guitar soloing.<br /><br />All told, \\"King Animal\\" is  not a record that will win over anybody that isn't already a Soundgarden fan; but it is a strong and very enjoyable reunion album, and one that re-establishes Soundgarden's place on the map for becoming a powerhouse force in the world of hard rock/heavy metal/grunge. The boys have, indeed, been away for far too long, but they are back now, and still sound as strong as ever!emorable - singing,  but also catchy, bobbing, Led Zeppelin-esque guitar slices, an unorthodox and moderately tricky time-signature, and pleasantly surprising, polyrhythmic drumming, drops.

B005LAII12|5.0|I was a little afraid to see this movie thinking it would be raunchy.  Not so at all - very funny and good enough to see again and again.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|I have absolutely loved several of Ms. Milan's novels, but for some reason this one didn't do it for me. Normally I can't put her romances down, but I found it all too easy to walk away from THE DUCHESS WAR. I think it's because I'm having a hardtime accepting the hero at face value. He has too much virtue and not enough vice, given his upbringing. The heroine was delightful, and her background has to be one of the most unique creations I've come across in a regency romance, but I wasn't feeling the sparks between the two leads. Still, I'd rather spend my money on an \\"okay\\" Courtney Milan romance than most other books out there. Her writing is always high quality stuff.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This movie is great for the one simple reason. It brings gal pals together for a night of fun and laughter. The plot is not good but that doesn't even matter. The men are hot and the dancing is great. It's nice to have a chick flick with some flair for a change.
0545259088|3.0|I was a huge fan of the first two books in this series, but now that I've (finally!) read the conclusion to the series, I find that I'm a little disappointed. FOREVER was certainly a page-turner, but to me the heart of the story was always Sam and Grace, and they took a backseat to more interesting characters, namely Cole and Isabel. There was also very little action and a whole lot of emo for a good two thirds of the story, and then when the action did happen, it felt rushed and left me unsatisfied with the conclusion. That said, I think Ms. Steifvater writes novels that transcend the YA category, and are equally appealing to adult readers.
B0071T4BVC|4.0|No hint of rock.  I can imagine an upscale restaurant in the 1940s or 1950s using these ballads as dinner music.  Sounds like an album that could have been released in 1950.  Well done and very seriously sung by Paul McCartney as if a time machine brought him back in time and this was his job as a singer of romantic pop jazz tunes.  He could be on a venue with Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I don't think Collins knows how to write unless her characters are in the Hunger Games. It wasn't a horrible book, it was just without any sort of real direction. She tried, but the ending is a let-down. Where did Katniss, the girl who is on fire, go? Having your heroine lose all of her spunk 10 pages into the last book does not bode well for a conclusion.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Unbelievable lack of extra features fom a movie that begs for it! An obvious attempt for another release tomake more money!
B007L6VR12|5.0|loved this movie--and have seen it 3 times--always something new visually.  plus the story line is very cute, very heartwarming...and tells a great story about human nature and mis-estimating people (for the good or bad).
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|i felt like this one did not have that much action in it,well sure the book was cool but we think you can do better
6305132984|5.0|great recording and price enjoyed it.  reccommend it.  had never seen movie before so was worth the purchase.  may try another
1423140605|5.0|We give a book as on e of the three Christmas presents our kids receive at Christmas.  Our son has been wanting this book for quite some time.  He loved it!  So glad we made this purchase.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I got an iPad for Christmas. I wanted to experiment on<br />taking pictures and doing things with them. This kit<br />worked just fine.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put this down! I felt so close to the characters, on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what would happen to them. I'm a sucker for dystopian stories and this did not disappoint, it was so well thought out. I read as many reviews as I can before I buy a book but seriously, stop reading and commit to the series! Every dystopian story has a learning curve where you try to \\"get\\" what happened to these people and this one is so very worth the ride.
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|I first read Something Borrowed and really like it.  This was the same story told from a different viewpoint.  It was not nearly as good.
1589944607|5.0|Battlestar Galactica is my go-to board game. My friends and I played this multiple times a night almost every Friday and Saturday during my senior year of college. It's got a steep learning curve, and you need to have a good 2-3 hours to commit to it, but when you get into a game, it's all worth it. The tension you get when you realize you can't resolve a crisis, or hold off a cylon fleet, without trusting someone you're not sure you can trust is exhilarating. The game is so much fun that my friends and I will often spend almost an hour debriefing and reliving the best moments from the night's epic games. I cannot recommend this highly enough.
8866130915|5.0|This is the second year I have used this book to keep up with appointments.  It is small enough to fit in my pocketbook but, the calendar spaces are large enough to write appointment times and names.  The page across from the calendar page is a great help because it gives extra space for notes.  I would recommend this item for anyone needing a way to keep up with commitments.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I usually loose, but this program gives usable hints. I can loose myself playing this version of solitaire. GOOD<br />JOB
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this app.  I would recommend it to others especially if you cant see well. its big so you can see it easily
B009A882D0|4.0|This is a collection I will feel comfortable leaving to my kids. This is americana at it best. Great packaging!
1451648537|5.0|I gave this as a birthday gift and the person really liked it and of course read it.  Thank you!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A must have app for the Kindle Fire!  Easy to use and navigate and a necessary addition to your app library.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I really like this soundtrack. It definitely means more to you if you've actually seen the movie. The actors don't belt out the songs, like on Broadway, but the music is soo full of emotion it's amazing! My only complaint is how can you have a highlights album without \\"Do you hear the people sing\\"!
B0043WDK2G|5.0|It is so amazing and HILARIOUS!!!!! It is unny with how the drama is between Castle and Dective Kate Beckett!!!
B00051E906|4.0|Simple product which is easy to use. At the same time, don't expect a lot of options and extra features. I give it 4 stars out of 5.
B008458O3S|5.0|This is a great little logic game.<br />It's challenging enough for me, but who loves it is our 6 year old! He enjoys and does really well at mazes and logic games, and this is just right.
B000J025AE|5.0|I love the movie. They did a lot of rewite from the old one. I am going to watch it again.
B005LAIISA|5.0|If it's laughter you're looking for, this DVD will not disappoint.  Like the others in this series, there's much levity and as usual, a nice message to be had.  Can be enjoyed by any age.
0425252868|5.0|This story is terrific. You must read it to understand the level of emotion involved here.  I read the book in one day, could not put it down.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the sounds in this app. I am very pleased that it was free. I still would've downloaded it if it wasn't
B004MWI2M0|5.0|these are all awesome packs and sets. my son got three different ones for xmas, (he's just six years old) and he had them put together in two days and was playing away! **That's not to say they are easy or that all six year olds would do that... he's just obsessed and he'll sit with the instructions and work and work til it's done. The sets are very detailed with fun moving parts and people from the movie scenes. great sets!
0765325950|1.0|When will content owners get a clue?  We want to consume your valuable content via our devices!!!!  Kindle at a minimum.  The shear stupidity of the idea of not releasing a digital (controllable, DRMed, official) version of a popular book is insane!<br /><br />#PublishersGetAClue
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Rush has always been a very private band.  This documentary really chronicled their career as a band and gave lots of insight to their roots.  The interviews from other bands showed how well they are appreciated amongst their peers.  I have a greater appreciation for Rush thanks to this.  A must have for any Rush fan.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Flashback to the 70's/80's.  Awesome combination of different medias.  Great purchase find.  Would highly recommend to anyone who remembers Zep.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son who is very into constructing and designing loved this app.  He has not put it down since we purchased it.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Another great Ken Follett spy novel!  I'm glad I found this author and plan to read many more novels.<br />Nobody can beat the British when it comes to espionage!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved the intense lust in this story.  I have re-read this book THREE times since I bought it last year. I loved the main characters, Abby & Travis.  I admire how Abby responds to confrontation, quickly and without much hesitation.  I am SO looking forward to reading 'Walking Disaster.  Travis' actions are so intense toward Abby it makes me melt!!!!!
B005OP7162|5.0|If you're looking for revenge this show doesn't disappoint!  Emily Thorne is superb and very believable!  Always wondered what the Hamptons looked like!
0553062182|5.0|I bought this book a number of years ago when I began writing [[[ASIN:1622490029 The Introvert's Guide to Greater Success at Work and Home]]...]. Although I am not a strong HSP (highly sensitive person), I discovered that I was more physically and emotionally sensitive than I realized.  Aaron indicates that 70% of highly sensitive people are also introverts.  Since there is often a prejudice against introverts in western culture, I encourage the reader to find a good book that addresses strategies for introverts to go along with this book.  This is an excellent read for those who often feel overly sensitive throughout the day . . . and for those who live and work with highly sensitive people.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The plot is spot-on when it describes poverty, elitism, and the consequences of society gone wrong.  Acting is excellent and I look forward to the next two movies!
B000000OU0|5.0|the entire cd is good but they skipped on song on the cd which is on the dvd is henley's the heart of the matter done acoustically which is so good it's probally the best sounding song on the mtv concert they filmed they cut it because griffeng recourds wouldn't allow them to put 2 of there songs on the cd but they allowed it on the dvd look on youtube and type in heart of the matter and it will pop up all over the place
B0086700CM|4.0|Simple game and easy to play .  It is somewhat fun.  For free can not beat it. I would play.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia continues to lyrically & melodically impress her audience with this heartfelt, genuinely great album - probably her best yet.  Always refreshing to see an artist top themselves, like a fine wine with age.  Kudos!
B0061S073A|2.0|This app is too limited in the amount of customization you can do. While I can set the apps, I couldn't find a way to place my daughter's books on her home screen with this app. I will continue to use the kindle's built in parental controls.
0756686970|5.0|My grandson could not put this down,he loved it. My son had Star Wars stuff when he was little boy and he enjoyed lokking at the book too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Outstanding production from every aspect.  Top notch writing, acting, casting, costumes and sets.  Maggie Smith in particular is delightful but the entire cast is remarkable.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|I loved the Neat-oh. My grandson loves building legos so it came in very handy(better then using my rubbermaid stuff.I will order him more.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This is an ok game if you want to play it out over a few years. It is kinda cool but having to wait for an energy refill is kinda lame
B005H0IW6W|5.0|It was a gift for her from me and she was ecstatic ....just loves it.  She said she'll play it all winter.
0451450523|5.0|The Last Unicorn was my favorite movie when I was a kid, I'd always beg my mom to rent it from the Blockbuster. I'm pretty sure I'm the one who ran the tape bare on that VHS... I had never read the book, so now that I'm wanting to relive my youth, I decided to buy it. It's even better than the movie, as expected of books! The writing style is easy to read, so it's appropriate even for younger readers. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy and unicorns.
B004XZR63M|5.0|one of the most motivating books ever read, if you follow the advice mentioned you are about to change your life
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My mom said she wanted this CD, so I got it for her. She called me after Christmas to let me know that she really loves it. Cello Wars is one of her favorite tracks.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Just what I needed  to charge my new iPhone 5 in my older Jeep. Works perfectly, and coiled cord is extra long
1451695195|2.0|As purely a book about the existence of God, the book has merit. And there are plenty of positive posts already written that speak to it.<br /><br />My concern is that the book is not a Christian message about God.  It is more of a New Age testimonial than the historic Christian gospel message based on sound biblical theology.<br /><br />1.His description of God dwelling in the Core and being called OM have no basis in the word of God.<br />2.The central message of the NDE is that God is unconditional love, which is good, but strongly implies a universal salvation. His guide continually emphasized that he could do nothing wrong. The writer by his own admission was not a believer in God, much less Christ, at the time that he had this experience. And yet he was accepted into Heaven and even God's presence, without ever being told his need for Christ. John 3:16-17.<br />3.His reference to psychic channeling as a positive, and the Authors current involvement in similar scholarly activities is also spoken against in the bible.<br />4.The publications that are pushing this book like Huffington Post, Salon and other liberal organizations, speak volumes.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Never was a fan of DS; I was a kid when it was aired originally & it scared me.  The movie though had a lot of great moments, some dull but overall, the film was well worth viewing.  Helena's performance was lukewarm as was Michele's.  JD was superb with his projection of &#34;innocence&#34; at being dumbfounded by some of the 70's rhetoric.  I enjoyed it, but am glad I didn't pay to go see it at a theater.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This game is very addicting. Everyone in my family plays it. We have even gotten family members outside the household to play. Fun and addicting!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas.  He loves it so much but now son is making noises about how he wants it too...they may have to share.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I can't even get this to download!! You've even denied me the right to tell you what a piece of crap it is, and to complain that I had to pay for additional fonts!!
B00005NTJK|5.0|Of all the music I bought hubby for Christmas, this is the one he listened to first.  He's got other Jethro Tull music on his Ipod but not this one.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We just discovered this series on accident.  My son, husband and I are all depressed that it's over so soon!  Do no advertisers want our money??  I promise I'd even watch some commercials if it would help bring it back!!  And we spend a lot of money on stuff we don't need.  This series had it all -- action, excitement, humor, romance, good soundtrack, great concept, excellent acting.  With all the crap on television, I can't believe this series didn't make it.  What's wrong with Hollywood??
B0067LXQAW|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was so surprised it existed.  Old favorites of his but he was missing some of their music.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|I liked all the Twist & Turns. It's a good movie. Makes you wonder it she'll ever get it, the loop stopped.
0307943232|5.0|It was a gift, my husband loved it. I can't tell you any more I did not read it. Likes John Grisham.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Donnie Yen Is AWESOME. I love this film. His portrayal of Bruce Lee's mentor is great. I see Bruce Lee's moves in this man.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love mysteries and this book by Gillian Flynn is very good.  Her other mystery &#34;Gone Girl&#34; is just as good or better.  Nice to have a new author to keep me interested.
B00005LK94|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. The fun flying in the ultra-light is awesome. I too use to fly this type of ultr-lights. They're a blast. Brought back great flying memories for me.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Characters drive this story and even four books into it there is a connection to characters. The characters in this story grow and change and have real faults. The continuing saga of the warring families could stand on its own, but is richer as part of the series. The story moves locations and can get a bit confusing but otherwise this is a great read while you are relaxing.
B000I0QL82|5.0|I never saw this movie before. I enjoyed all the song & dance. It's a good holiday film. I like Bing & Fred.
B008VBYN80|2.0|I enjoyed this game for a little while but was surprised that they expect $3-$5 to complete some most actions after level18. way too pricey for me.
1451675046|4.0|This is a more accessable version of information and views presented in The God Delusion and The Greatest Show on Earth. It is a great service to those without a background in the life sciences. The Magic of Reality is a good read, although both of those books are more interesting, even delightful. I donate many books to the library. Books by Richard Dawkins stay on my shelf.

0486278077|4.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray<br />by Oscar Wilde<br />Originally Published in 1890.<br /><br />Grade: B+<br /><br />Roughly, this novel can be cataloged as a \\"Transgressional Fiction.\\"  A main character, Dorian Gray, leads a hedonistic life, believing that a life serving senses and beauty is the most ideal way to lead one.  The book mainly focuses on a theme of sin and art, and this review will analyze how this novel treats aforementioned two topics and what readers can gain from such perspectives.<br /><br />Is sin inseparable part of one's life?  No matter how moral or innocent way of life one seemingly leads, does sin work  its way in insidiously to contaminate and destroy our soul?  Oscar Wilde would agree.  The novel is an intense meditation on morality.  Here, As Dorian Gray leads a debauchery life, he is representing the dark side of morality.  Once influenced by Lord Henry, who insists that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it,\\" Dorian Gray's sole purpose in life is to please his senses despite the costs such lifestyle would incur.  His sudden, whimsical wish that his portrait drawn by his admirer, Basil Hallward, would physically age instead of himself, comes true, and for the next 18 years, he keeps his youthful appearance while his portrait grows old.  During those 18 years, he indulges himself in many indecencies (although readers could only glimpse at the specificity of those acts since apparently the press banned a number of erotic references when it was first published), yet he remains pure and pristine outwardly.  His callous attitude toward and apathetic reception of others slowly taints his soul.  One's decisive philosophy on life has huge impact on his moral conscious, as can be seen from Dorian's life.  Dorian seldom visits his attic where he has hidden his portrait and takes a look at it.  The portrait looks more horrific and sinister with the signs of aging everytime he looks at it.  His sin is coming alive and reveals itself in the portrait.<br /><br />Here, Oscar Wilde seems to suggest that we human beings are all sinners since no one is immune to aging of one's physical forms.  We age because we sin.  Sin is one of inextricable condition of human being's life.  As written in the introduction to the novel, \\"it portrays the author's internal battles and arrives at the disturbing possibility that `Ugliness is the only reality.'\\"<br /><br />Then, can we, readers, say that Dorian Gray's sin's are unnatural and abomination?  Can we not conclude that his sin is just different kind of sin from all the sins that human beings commit?  Is his sin greater in intensity than the sins commited by others?  If ugliness is the only reality, then he is merely candid with himself and is living in a true reality whereas everyone else only swims in the pool of illusions.<br /><br />In theology, it claims that God exists because everyone needs redemption.  And we need to attain it through Him.  If everyone needs redemption, then it logically follows that everyone sins.  Although people may have rebuked Wilde's only novel due to immorality portrayed and done by Dorian Gray, they have done so because they were afraid to look at their own ugliness through the reflection cast by this very novel.  Sin is a natural rebellion we all harbor, however unknowably, deep in our heart.  Lucifer and Dorian Gray, they were just more honest with what their hearts were telling them.<br /><br />The theme of art, although seems peripheral to the theme of sin, is indeed an important facet that makes up the novel.  The artist who paints the portrait of Dorian Gray poured his soul in the this very art.  This metaphor becomes reality and the portrait embodies the soul of Dorian Gray.  In addition, Dorian Gray is hugely influenced by the book given by Lord Henry Wotten, he who is ultra-liberal-minded and paradox loving friend of Dorian's.  The latter fact is autobiographical in context as Wilde confesses in his other essay.  Art affects lives exorbitantly.  Art changes lives.  Art roots unrootable philosophy deep inside one's heart.  Art has soul of its own, or the soul of its subject.<br /><br />Then, was Oscar Wilde honest when he claimed in the preface that `All art is quite useless\\"?  Anything that has capacity to change one's philosopy cannot be labeled `useless'.  The very constrast that's shown in the story of the book is that Dorian Gray could not have lived such decadent life if it weren't for his portrait drawn by his friend.  Art, here, gave him a new life.  Art, when applied, becomes indispensable aspects of one's life.  Scholars argue that the saying, \\"All art is quite useless,\\" was written after vituperative remarks Wilde received from his critics.  It was his defense; yet his novels immediately rejects such claim through inordinate life story of Dorian Gray.<br /><br />Like many great novels, The Picture of Dorian Gray is a representation of a certain movement at a specific time.  The movement was called `Aesthetic Movement,\\" and the book remains as a symbol of its era, must as Albert Camus's book The Strangers remains the representation of existentialism in the 50s.  Interestingly, the book is inundated with paradoxes, most of which were conveyed by Lord Henry Wotten, and its purpose is worthnoting.  Dialectic has been a method for a couple millennia to get at the truth, and it seems like Wilde is purportedly using paradoxes to give us a chance to see other side by our commonly dull perspective.  He is suggesting that morality is not easily defined, that the difference between virtue and vice is paper-thin.  Here are some examples of paradoxes narrated by Lord Henry Wotton followed by my own interpretation:<br />\\"We shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.\\"  -God's gifts are not a blessing but rather a curse-<br />\\"It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.\\" -People who use their intelligence and rhetoric for the purpose of arguing don't look smart; instead they look lost-<br />\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-<br />\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\"  -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.<br /><br />===  Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===<br /><br />\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"<br />\\"`Always' is a dreadful word.  It makes me shudder when I hear it.  Women are so fond of using it.  They spoil every romance by trying to make it last forever.  It is a meaningless word too.  The only difference between a caprice & a life-long passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer.\\"<br />\\"Sin is the only real color-element left in modern life.\\"<br />\\"One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details.  Details are always vulgar.\\"<br />\\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing?  I think not.  It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.<br />\\"To define is to limit.\\"<br />\\"Every effect that one produces gives on an enemy.  To be popular, one must be a mediocrity.\\"<br />\\"Their strong passions must either bruise or bend.  They either slay the man or themselves die.  Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.\\"<br /><br />This book is riveting and memorable book, full of paradoxies and deep insights and commentaries on life.  I recommend this book to ones bored by mediocry of general mass and also to those who would like to see liberal-mindedness in its extreme.  Although the main character leads a decadent life, because of censorship at the times, the passages do not contain explicit sexual scenes ordrug usage.  Approximately four movie adaptations on this novel have been made so far, the last one of which stars Colin Firth.smart; instead they look lost-<br />\\"Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.\\" -It seems like the phrase is boasting the wonders and greatness of unfaithfulness, focusing on its dramatic elements-<br />\\"And Beauty is a form of Genius--is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation.\\"  -We generally think that concept of beauty as greatness is fleeting, that beauty is inferior virtue from other types of virtues; yet Lord Henry claims that beauty is the apex among all virtues.<br /><br />===  Forgoing my own interpretation for here are more wonderful paradoxes ===<br /><br />\\"The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.\\"<br />\\"`Always' is a dreadful word.

1449410243|3.0|Like many of the other reviewers posted, there's not a whole lot new material. I knew it when I bought it, but still wanted to have it because I enjoy reading them. It was a tad disappointing to see how much little new material there was, but I still liked it and enjoyed reading it. If you want something new that you don't see on the website, I'd suggest getting his other book How to Punch a Dolpin in the Mouth.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a superb english classic !!!  I got hooked on the series after watching Season 1, and after watching Season 2, I ordered the two DVD box set on amazon.com.  I pre-ordered the Season 3 DVD and I know once this series is finished running on PBS, and Season 3 is released, I will be watching the entire series again.  Only one episode has aired for Season 3, however, the intereactions between Maggie Smith and Shirley MacLaine is definately going to be a focal point with this series.  Dare I hope there will be a season 4?

B00A9X9TIW|1.0|The plot of this movie may sound good on paper, but it's all over the place.  It isn't worth the effort to stay attentive.  Once you figure out what the guy is doing in the future, then you've pretty much seen the whole movie.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard is a fun app that allows you to customize a gazillion news feeds into one easy to use location.  There are literally so many on-line blogs, news feeds, sites and who knows what that a user can select, you could be reviewing these all day and not have a duplicate.  Although some individual articles do appear on multiple sites, it's not distracting.  I guess Flipboard has no control over content.  We have installed it on our Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet and a Motorola Droid both running Android ICS and they work great.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the cast and the story.  I hope it goes on for years.  It seems so authentic to the period.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is exactly what I was looking for!  It is constructed very nicely, the zippers are easy to use and feel sturdy, it has plenty of room for all of my gear, and it holds a tripod with ease.<br /><br />I typically store 1 camera body (D5100), 4 lenses (12-24 f/4, 35 f/1.8, 60mm f/2.8 macro, and 55-300 f/4.5-5.6), 2 flashes (YN-560ii), 4 wireless radio triggers, 3 battery chargers (1 Nikon charger and 2 Eneloop chargers), and various accessories (filters, extra batteries, extra memory cards, straps, flash feet, etc etc) all in this bag with absolutely no issue!<br /><br />The straps are comfortable and supportive.  The bag seems as though it provides good protection for my equipment.<br /><br />I am very pleased.  I highly recommend this product!

B009JBZH54|5.0|I surprised my husband with the Batman trilogy for Christmas and he was ecstatic. We are both super hero movie buffs and these movies are fantastic. I am sad there are only going to be three movies, however that made it easier for me to buy this trilogy set knowing more would not be released. It comes in a nice box to keep the three movies together. I'm not sure of the movies ratings, but I wouldn't recommend them to anyone younger than 14 years of age. There is a lot of violence that children really do not need to be subjected to. This makes a great gift for the movie buff!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight legend ends with this Movie. It is thrilling to the very end. A must have for your digital library.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This product is exactly what it is listed, the complete 5th season. The show is very funny and popular among many age groups. There are some sexual innuendos but it is on prime time TV and I would feel very comfortable watching this show with my middle school aged cousins. While the show builds on previous episodes, if you were to start watching in the 5th season you would not be &#34;lost&#34; by any means. The characters are all lovable and goofy, they use lots of big words and talk about scientific theories, but you do not feel dumb for not knowing what they are talking about. It is more based on friendship and lack of social understandings.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game but the print is to small that it's hard to read and I can't enlarge the print on my mindless.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the twists and turns! If you are a fan of mysteries or just enjoy some psychological thrillers: read this! I found myself choosing sides then switching sides, then getting upset that I trusted the characters lol. You know its a good book when you get so involved and feel like you were tricked. :-)
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great case and extras in the trilogy! The movies are excellent quality no issues with the actual discs. Plus the movies are phenomenal.
B005HP2J66|5.0|What an amazing find and an exciting documentation of its discovery and its riches.  Bought this as a Christmas gift for my mountain climbing and spelunking grandson and his sweetheart.  Herzog is brilliant!

B004UPAIDK|3.0|The horror genre has gotten way too serious.  The Evil Dead series reminds us how much fun getting scared by silly special effects can be.

Reading something like this makes us more aware and appreciative of the valor and dedication of these people.

B000R8YC18|5.0|Taxi Driver is one of the greatest, and most disturbing, American produced movies ever!  Scorsese's perfect pairing of DeNiro and Keitel go from close friends on the Mean Streets to hated enemies in Taxi Driver!  I was excited to have a chance to order this 2 disc collector's edition at a very reasonable price!  However, it was shipped in only a very thin plastic wrap and arrived with one corner damaged.  Plus the bonus disc was loose and a little scratched.  These types of shipments should always be packaged in a bubble lined envelope.

B005IQ39AY|2.0|I was enjoying this app and had over 200 balls left when the game told me I had failed the level and ended.  I played more times and it happened again.  I could not find any rules or why this wad occurring.  Thus, it will be shelved. I would have recommended it if not for that.  The saving grace is that I got it free.

B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Good dialog and eye candy.  If you're a realist and have a hard time with movies that are a little over the top in terms of reality then you would care much for this one.  My wife thought it was dumb.  She couldn't get past the two dudes getting with one chick concept.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book makes you stop and think about your life and why it moves at the pace it's meant to move.  You think about when you wish your life would speed up or slow down.  We need every moment in our lives for a specific reason, it makes us who we are meant to be.  Life is meant to be lived not raced through for the next experience.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|If the first book wasn't enough, the second is the all by heart grabbing, every girls dream and has husband approval. E l James interviews stating she wrote a love story....yes, yes she did. The end gives an unexpected twist leaving you wanting more...

B003JTHXOK|5.0|*spoilers*<br /><br />This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I have read, but felt that the ending with \\"Jo\\" was strange.  I didn't really understand why the plot twist in relation to the book.  I also thought it was almost irresponsible for Alex to put his children in danger the way he did.  In the aftermath, I thought he seemed to calm about the situation.  I expected him to be more shaken for his children, instead of for Katie/Erin.<br /><br />Besides this, I thought the book was very well written, suspenseful, and entertaining.  I enjoyed the three points of view.  I understood how quickly Alex and Katie/Erin fell in love.  I also enjoyed seeing inside the mentally unstable brain of the husband, Kevin!
0783233477|5.0|I liked the premise  the acting was very good  Anthony Hopkins is such a great actor  Brad Pitt was, well Brad Pitt  beautiful and a very good actor

B00632HWOG|1.0|since the new version was released I cant rely on consistently getting email notifications. even when opening the program and refreshing they don't come in on my adroid based devices (phone and kindle fire).  why downgrade from the former operable system to this?
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I currently work at a bookstore where children rave about this series. I promised a young girl I would read it, and although I am in my twenties, I enjoyed it very much. I think it's a great juvenile fiction story and I plan on reading the rest of the series.<br /><br />If you're looking for a challenging chapter book for your child, I would recommend this. Not just for the creativity, but the vocabulary is advanced, with meanings provided by the author in the text which adds to the character of the narrator.<br /><br />For those unaware of this series, it is more on the morbid side, but not in a crass way. It's incredibly tasteful, and the sad parts are represented in a way to be more relatable than downright depressing. The narrator feels more like a friend opening a door to the world around you to explain things than just a character telling you a string of events.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I am loving the wunderlist app, because it's just a simple to do list that's not bogged down with trying to integrate with a bunch of other apps. It's a list maker, and that's it. You just create a to-do item,  add a quick note,  set a reminder or due date, and off you go. There's no working around unwanted features.
0064409422|5.0|I got the Chronicles of Narnia, the boxed set when I was 8 years old. It was a christmas present I believe. I love these stories because I love the idea of being able to discover another world from your home. Whether it be walking through a closet, putting on an enchanted bracelet, or being taken into a living picture! After all, that's what we do when were reading, isn't that why we read? We read to escape! To go to another world!<br /><br />Recently I read another book that reminded me of the Lewis's books. Not in writing style, but in the type of story written. New Author, David J. Eden, recently published a book titled<br />Mirage: The First of the Nascentian Chronicles. In Eden's story, a troubled young man finds himself in great danger. Just before his imminent doom strikes, he his saved by a beautiful and mysterious woman who transports him to another called Nascentia, where together they embark on many adventures together and save her world. If you want to know more, check it out: [[ASIN:B00AY7G2AG Mirage - The First of the Nascentian Chronicles]]<br /><br />I have always loved the Chronicles of Narnia in the way that it is symbolic of certain aspects of Christianity. The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe, teach these principles more clearly than any other book. For Edmund it is a story about redemption, only Aslan can save him from the evil of the White witch. For each of the children, Narnia helps them discover who they really are and I love that about this book.<br /><br />If you haven't read them yet or if you just haven't read them in a while and you've lost your copy, get this book. Get the whole set even. The collectors edition is beautiful and worth having. You children will enjoy it for years to come!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|absolutely love this game. my three yr old cant get enough. the Colorado are great as well as the need for strategy.
B000FCKPHG|4.0|growth or fixed mindset - once you realize the difference, its can have a great impact on you personally, your career, even perhaps how you raise your kids.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is by far the best one out of all three. I love how it has Christian Grey's outlook at the end brilliant idea!
B0053TWV46|5.0|I've always loved horror films of the 80s and its not full of cheezy cgi effects like most are today.  If you've seen the first Creepshow you'll love this one!  It follows in same footsteps.  I like all four of the stories in this one, but my favorites have to be the Raft and the Hitchhiker.  The Raft reminds me a lot of the Blob but out on the water this time.  I won't spoil anything but its all good fun.  The only draw back of this sequel is the number of stories compared to the first.  This is the only worthy sequel of Creepshow and I won't even talk about the garbage that is Creepshow 3.  I recommend checking this one out!
B0042C52VY|5.0|easy to learn, fast to play, and challenging to all ages.  My 6 yr old can play and loves it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Love it it iss amazing and high quality i love games like these and hope you can come up with more
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read in years. The way Suzanne Collins is able to craft her writing can hardly be explained. The imagery that she uses is marvelous and kept me entranced in the story from beginning to end. This book should be on the top of everyone's reading list.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|\\"I'm stranded on Mars. I have no way to communicate with Hermes or Earth. Everyone thinks I'm dead. I'm in a Hab designed to last 31 days. If the Oxygenator breaks down, I'll suffocate. If the Water Reclaimer breaks down, I'll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I'll just kind of explode. If none of those things happen, I'll eventually run out of food and starve to death. So yeah. I'm f----d.\\" - Mark Watney<br /><br />As the two-hundred thirty-fourth reader to review THE MARTIAN by Andy Weir, I have no illusion that I can add anything substantive to the plaudits already heaped on this intelligent work of space sci-fi. Simply put, it's a nail-biter that'll trim your finger nail plates down even with the nail beds.<br /><br />My reading tastes usually don't encompass space fiction because the vast majority of it seems to fall within the realm of extreme fantasy with worlds and ETs of the most fantastical sorts. I prefer my off-Earth stories to have some plausible connection with realistic, albeit extrapolated, technology and situations, and the one book that remains embedded in my memory as simply terrific is from all the way back in 1975 when I was much younger and perhaps more impressionable - Arthur C. Clarke's [[ASIN:0899684491 Rendezvous with Rama]]. With films, I'm the same way; [[ASIN:B001R1DZ4Y Outland]] and [[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]] come to mind. THE MARTIAN is my kind of SF.<br /><br />In Mars mission engineer-botanist Mark Watney we have a thinking man's hero for the ages, and THE MARTIAN is a story that cries out to be serialized for television.<br /><br />THE MARTIAN would be ideal for a lengthy trans-ocean plane flight. If you start the book on take-off, you'll likely finish on landing and not even be aware of the hours that passed or the screaming kid a couple of rows back.<br /><br />You owe yourself this novel. Trust me.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book is great for older kids like 10-14 or 15 year olds. It's just a great book. Boo ya
B000ZLFALS|4.0|I've always been a great Beatles fan and this movie incorporates their music in a great storyline about the 1960s!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautifully written as well as a wonderful story. Amazing unpredictable transformations and turn of events. I highly recommend this book!
B0015519VS|2.0|Lyrics make me wonder about the club life experiences that have passed...understand you grow and have to show your maturity, but we want to get out and dance.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This book is as awesome as... Harry Potter. But it is easier to understand. Most of the time. But you should still read it.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Excellent description of war as hell.  The book got me to feel and think like a marine going through the awful battles that the author was lucky enough to live through.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book Jeff Kinney is my favorite authors he writes amazing books I almost have the whole seiries
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Don't let the \\"comic book movie\\" stigma put you off. The Avengers was a great action movie. It has a decent plot in between the action scenes and the ending is great.  I guarantee you will turn it off screaming like the Hulk.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Very good<br />and be ret tee Der Der Der Der Der Der Der Der Der Der Der Der Der Der
B004SBULWE|5.0|this works very well at keeping apps shut down to save memory when you aren't using them as well as shutting apps down if they aren't shutting down properly on their own.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was such a touching book :) Plus it has a great ending. There was definitely no dull moment  in the book. Enjoy reading it!
1450419895|5.0|The book provides good insight into the proper way to lift and muscle interaction.  I have been lifting for a very long time.  This book provided me with several new ideas and techniques which I now use.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|While this is the best show since the Sopranos, and just keeps improving with every season.  It takes you into a different world, and the character development throughout the seasons just keeps you addicted.  Great characters, great casting, and Katie Sagal is absolutely brilliant!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Can't go wrong with this DVD.  Acting is okay but the dancing is all that is really required.  Its a must have for all ladies over 21.
0345803493|5.0|I am usually all about mysteries and thrillers, but the 50 shades series seemed like a vacation.  I can understand why it is so popular.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|i love this game for my kindle but on my ipod i have a free bling button but not on here. add me fb8d7
B005LAII3U|4.0|I admit I liked the original mainly cause it was so cheesy for a story line...so wondered how this movie would be...and I admit I liked this version..it followed a bit from time to time on the original movie..but not enough to distract from this new one. I would say that I enjoyed this movie.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Clearly an instant disney classic- watched with a grown man and a three year old who both loved it. Amazon streaming is flawless; I will rent from amazon again!
081297381X|1.0|After reading and liking \\"Fooled By Randomness,\\" I was looking forward<br />to a great read in this book, only to be severely disappointed.  It's<br />more of an arbitrary compilation of musings, criticisms, ramblings, etc., about<br />everything from his childhood, to philosophy, to mathematics, to science,<br />but then you get the idea.  I was going to read \\"Anti-Fragile.\\" too but<br />I think I'll pass.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I downloaded this right after Christmas and have a hard time putting down, it's so addictive! My daughter has all of the Angry birds games on both the pc and my laptop, but she's not allowed to play on my Kindle. Why does this game draw me in so much? Thank you Rovio for making a free version of the game that isn't just a few levels, after which you must pay for subsequent ones.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Like the rest of her life, her music is so raw and unafraid. This album is honest but still has the tracks to keep the party going. I love it.
B00APUQH0W|1.0|The movie content was very good.  However, for some reason the audio was not synched with the video.  Therefore, it was very uncomfortable to watch.  Technical difficulties?  Amazon problem or the videographer?
B002XISFGS|3.0|I am a Trekkie. Not a Trekker, but one of those fans who was watching when I was 6 and it was still on the air as a first run series. I wrote a letter to NBC as a 7 year old to keep it on the air. In 1979, as a college freshman, this film came out in theaters. It was a momentous occasion. One of the icons of my childhood that had been solidified in my life through reruns was hitting the big screen! Despite the fact that seeing this movie in Dec. 79 was also the first time I met my ex wife on a blind date, I will try to put this movie in perspective. If you're a real fan, you will love the long, and I mean LONG, shots of the Enterprise in space dock, the sight of each of our heroes, and especially Spock as he boards the ship. You're just glad to have them back. If you can forget that they gave us a few better pictures later, and recapture the awe of seeing them again after such a long absence, then buy this film. It's a bomb otherwise as far as the story goes. As someone has said before me, this is where Nomad has gone before. (only a Trekkie will get that).
B008AWBQGM|5.0|One tune says it all,&#34;Home Grown&#34;! Very good, unlike the earlier years, which were great! A++! If you like southern rock, this is a great album!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Eva and Gideon belong together but they have to work at it.  I loved the up and down emotions I felt from going from a happy, sexy moment between the two to an intense, dramatic one.  What draws me so much to this couple is their love and their devotion to each other.<br />Sylvia Day is amazing. I really enjoyed this series so much. I can't wait for book 3.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Another great effort by the trio! Great, mind your own business tunes! Typical great ZZ form, take all the money, and run! Thanks Billy, Frank, and Dusty!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was so good that it was addicting. I could not put this book down until the end of the book.<br />I enjoy reading books with story line of bad boy/good girl pairing and quickly fell in love with Travis and Abby. Abby has some commitment issues and Travis on the other hand doesn't really know what a real relationship should be like.  Travis grew up as the book progressed and Abby learned to cope with her past while falling in love. I can't wait to read more books by Jamie McGuire.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|Sean Connery claimed he would never play 007 again hence the title of this 1983 Bond flick. 1983 was a good year for Bond lovers it also gave us &#34;octopussy&#34;. Never say never again put Sean one movie ahead of Roger Moore 6 for Roger 7 for Sean. Roger not to be out done retired his bond role after tying Sean 7 to 7 with 1985's &#34;A view to a kill&#34; there is another unoffical Bond movie the first &#34;Casino Royal&#34; starring David Niven as 007, making him & George Lazenby the only two actors to do a one time performance as 007 if you discount the made for T.V. Casino Royal which featured a americanized version of Bond a Jimmy Bond, YUK!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was fabulous! I was instantly drawn in and wrapped up in the story. I loved the characters and thought the book was well written. I usually don't write reviews, but this book is one of the best I have read and felt it was necessary to give it 5 stars. I highly recommend this book!
B00000K0EA|5.0|Everyone was clammering for Pierce Brosnon to play Bond the minute they saw him on the T.V. series &#34;Remington Steel&#34; and now we got him. I like all the James Bond movies being a big fan of the books it was fun to see hollywood formulate this character into a franchise success. Much different from the books are the ever popular gadget's from &#34;Q&#34;. Then there's the Bond Girl's and the cars. Actor's playing Bond will come and go but 007 will never die!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book! It was great, funny, cute and overall a great read!! I hope there is a sequel to this book!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone. I wonder how well the movie is? - jessie
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this for charging!!<br />Tells you how much time to full charge if using a plug or usb cord. Simply amazing
B00APUQRPC|5.0|It was a good show. It had a good ending. I enjoyed it and recommend it. Wish it had been a bit longer with more info at the end
B007U4DIM6|5.0|I watch the movie and it was cute. But this gift is for a friend of mine. And it's for his birthday cause he has the first and second.
B00499LTLM|5.0|It is a wonderful TV shows for detective story. I like it aloooooot and its good that every season only contains three episode cuz I wont giving up doing other stuffs on keep watching it! TOO good haha
B004P2HMNM|5.0|7 year old put this together very fast with limited help.  Still plays with it and seriously enjoyed putting it together.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|I loved it. It was a very good movie, have a Lotta action, and it made a very good drama.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is a really great book<br />And it relates to my life<br />style and I believe a lot of<br />people should read this
B008TMA1LY|1.0|so cute but you have to buy points - real money.  that's stupid.  also for whatever reason i couldn't see any characters, they were white boxes moving around.  it's not fun at all...
B001GTZEZ0|5.0|Loved one and two equally.  It was one of my favorite TV shows and the movies did not dissappoint.  Hope they make a third, will definitely buy that one also.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works well! Quick and lays out well so it's easy to read. Does not seem to have any glitches I've found.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Loved one and two equally.  It was one of my favorite TV shows and the movies did not dissappoint.  Hope they make a third.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I read several reviews before purchasing this book. It sounded like it was going to be great. I would like to start off on a positive note, and say that it didn't contain as many errors as many of the digital books have. It was well written. That being said, however, I can't believe the author wouldn't come right out and state this is a book about teens. If you were expecting a love story about adults, this is not it. I also got a huge Stephanie Meyeresque/Twilight vibe from this book, although it was more realistic, meaning the kids actually had sex, as many  teens would. I should also mention that both kids were human. The dark subject matter will not be for some, and could be quite disturbing and painful for those who have abusive pasts. I don't have anything against the young adult genre, I have read many good titles in that category. My biggest beef with this book, is label it young adult, so readers won't feel tricked after purchase. I would not have purchased the book had I known, but many would have.<br />If you like dark, angsty, teen driven books, then you will probably like this one.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Even though you know the outcome of this movie, it still holds your interest.  A must see for anyone who likes horse racing and a good story.  I have watched it more than once and will watch it again, it is that kind of movie.
B000002JBG|4.0|This classic was shipped very quickly - the only hiccup was a crack in the back of the CD case.  Could have been during shipping, not sure.  Fortunately, the CD itself is what I was anticipating, not the case.  Overall, I'm excited to tap back into my classic MJ days.
B002VECM6S|5.0|A must see for everyone.  Liked that it was based on truth and that I have actually watched him play in real life.  Sandra Bullock is awsome in this movie.  I have watched it about 10 times now and will watch it again someday.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|I guess when the main actor on a film series doesn't appear in the film, that's a clue the movie isn't going to be as good.  I have no idea if this movie was done by the same director, but the movie didn't feel like a Bourne movie at all.  Aside from a similar premise, the pacing and action were very different.  As a $1 redbox rental I still wouldn't have been overly happy with it.  As a $5.99 Amazon Video Rental I'm very unhappy.<br /><br />I should say, the quality of the video served by Amazon was superb.  It's Hollywood I'm unhappy with, not Amazon.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Regarding the message portrayed by this film about the life experience of Mr. McCandless, the film does very well in showing an idea of what both happiness and a happy life are. Although difficult to explain it in words, I agree with the film's idea that one's feelings of freedom, strength, courage, security, and even weakness are part of the equation that gives happiness as a result.<br /><br />Another idea that I would like to mention here is the idea that human inter-relationships are also part of the equation resulting in happiness. I might be mentally inflexible but it is sometimes difficult to find people with whom I can honestly share my experiences.<br /><br />Lastly, it is a bit suprising to me that our (human) survival depends very strongly on eating other animals, in addition to plants. Hope that great ideas always serve for good to everyone. And, that God blesses all, here particularly Mr. McCandless and his family.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My 11 year old bought this with his Christmas money after playing it with his teenaged cousins at Christmas.  He now plays it with me and his 9 year old brother.  The LOVE this game!  It is really a lot of fun.  Kind of like a new age monopoly!  It's something that you can start and come back to another day.  I love that we can play it together!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|The headphones were purchased as a gift. The recipient was amazed at the quailty of sound, it's like being at a concert.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I bought this CD after I saw him win many Grammy awards years ago and found that I loved his music!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I'm the type of person that is not so into reading. I'm a picky reader. Not every book is going to please me. But I love Jeff Kinney's books! It's like the only books I'll read. The series is great I can't wait till his next masterpiece!!
B00005YW4H|3.0|I purchased this CD many years ago and the music is still as wonderful today as it was back then!
B009738XXM|3.0|It is a great album. I enjoy it immensely. The songs are catchy and fun. There is nothing ground-breaking here though so if you accept what you are getting, you will enjoy this album.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Now this is what I expect when I puchase a deisc online No deception This disc was like new. Keep up the good work
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This took a knife that I have had for about 15 years and gave it a new life, I have sharpened it in the past but I have never been happy with edge on it until I ran this on it for about 20 minutes and it came back to better then the day I got it.
B0000C1733|5.0|I'm happy to give a good rating to the chili pepper disc. It was in as good  ashape as advertised.
B00973902K|5.0|I had to buy this in order to have my son try to make one of those videos that everyone from Havard Baseball to the Womens Olympic team made.  We enjoyed the video craze and enjoy this song.
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|This was such a warm and touching movie.  All the characters were great.  The ending was a surprise.  So many stories rolled into one and they were all equally good.  I really expected fluff but was impressed that all the movie was so deep.
B006O3MU96|5.0|very addicting! whenever i have sone free time i start up this game and get jumping! also it was the free app of the day so im glad i got to test it out but i definitely would pay for it now!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|If you love dogs you will love this movie.  Period. It was apparently a big hit overseas but could not find a distributor in the U.S and went straight to DVD--usually a bad sign,  In this instance, however, disregard that as it is a very nice film and very underrated.  Warning.  It will make you cry!
B000ATQYT2|4.0|I absolutely love this movie (one of my all time favorites--not just out of Christmas movies!). I find it weird that there are so many different versions people seem to recieve when ordering from this page, though. As I read through the reviews it seems not everyone got the same product. The one I received lets me choose if I want to watch the full theatrical version or the edited version (I also think that Belle's song is dumb so I watch the edited, typically). But, the disc came without full liner notes or anything like that, which seemed odd. Perhaps I just don't understand Amazon's fulfillment system so it seems a bit &#34;off&#34; to me. Nevertheless, overall happy with this purchase. Glad to own it for myself!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This has been my favorite things show since I first saw an episode. This season does not disappoint in any way.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I watched this movie three times within a 48 hour period. It's definitely one of my new favorites. The humor very much reminds me of Bridesmaids, but caters to the Glee crowd. It's very Gleeish, which doesn't bother me at all. LOVED it and already have a million jokes from it. I definitely recommend!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />I will be right to the point...  Hopeless is a beautifully written story with so much emotion that it will literally take your breath away. I laughed. I cried. I hurt.<br /><br />The way Colleen writes puts her readers right into the story and makes you believe and feel every word that you are reading. The characters are so real you can't help but feel their love, happiness, or pain.<br /><br />The way this story came together had me in complete shock. I had NO idea the story would go the direction it did. I look back at all the details of the story and how they came together to make one brilliant story. I am in awe of Colleen Hoover and her talent.<br /><br />The subject of the book is very intense and serious. It's definitely 17+<br /><br />\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\\"
0765325950|1.0|Any release of a book not accompanied by the kindle version is short sighted.  If the publishing industry really wants to increase sales and prevent digital piracy of works then releasing digital content in a fair and timely manner is key.  Now that I know a little more of the motivation behind this decision I have edited my review to reflect that.  I still give the overpriced hardcover 1 star and stand by that decision.  I won't be buying either the hardcover or digital copy of this book and hope that Tor can realize they lost a sale.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My wife and I have watched this movie several times. It is one of the few that is worth coming back to. It Always makes us laugh. Very well done.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|Liked the story very much a little frightening as it is to close to reality... lacked detail in the end as to what happened to people finished very quickly
B005FUTBWS|1.0|This film just didn't grab me. I gave up on it about 45 minutes into to, never even fished watching the DVD.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I have spent the last 20 years reading about WWII and absorbing, as best I can, the lessons to be learned from those who fought. This book provides not only the technical aspects and physical challenges faced by men on both sides of the European theater, but the emotional demands placed on them by others and, more significantly, on themselves. You can't really ever know how these brave men made it through the horrors of the WWII air war. This story, of two men, their comrades at arms and effects war had on their lives, brings you close to knowing.
0684135051|4.0|This item was a gift. Haven't heard any complaints as of yet. . . I will update if any issues arise
B003O86FMW|5.0|Downloaded to my ipod and for much cheaper than in the store.  It's a great book in the Hunger Games Series.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|AMAZING!!  LOVE this.  Saw them in concert over the summer and this gave me an opportunity to re-live it.  Love the fact that it came with a live cd!  I get to enjoy it at home and in the car! :o)
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Glad I got it. So much faster than regular cables. I am also glad I got white so I can find it easily among my black cables.
0316069434|4.0|This book is another Harry Bosche murder investigation that relates to a murder 20 years ago.It involves a murder of a reporter from Denmark and you must keep reading as the mystery unfolds.Its well written with a fast pace and glues come about with a good flow as not to confuse the reader too much but just to slowly put the Jig Saw together.<br />All will unfold in page 382 but i suggest you not to fast track but to read the book.<br /><br />Great read.Cannot wait for the next book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was better than I imagined.  I read the entire book in a day.  Could not put it down.  Starting book 2 right away.
0765325950|1.0|Thanks for catering to your audience of ebook readers, we really appreciate how the publisher is looking out for us. </sarcasm>  Seriously, a three month wait to get it in my preferred format, just because you want to pump up your hardback sales?  Well, I'm sure there are some other \\"providers\\" that will have it out much sooner than April.
B001ECPJZO|3.0|It would be nice if it came with some graphics or directions for tying a shoe.  It is very small, but sturdy.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My grandsons love anything Angry Birds or anything Star Wars.  Now they have both at the same time.  Too cool.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Combining tremendous violin skill on top of dubstep backgrounds is a genius combination. The music never gets old and when people hear it in my car they are always fascinated and uplifted. It's so much fun to listen to, Lindsey possesses tremendous artistic ability and talent.
B002MW50KO|4.0|So who would have thought this would come to be? A christmas album by Bob Dylan? Not very likely you might say, but still here it is. I bought this album because I like Bob Dylan, and because I like to have christmas albums from different artists. Simple as that. So how is it, this new christmas album of mine? It is probably what you can expect from an artist like Bob Dylan. It's slightly odd,funny,and very enjoyable. It seems to me that Mr. Dylan has taken a liking to musical influences from the forties lately. Just listen to the background singers. It sounds to me like the recordings were done in one big room with everybody performing at once. Making the tracks sound very organic and alive, and if I may say so a little bit scruffy. (It's Bob Dylan for heaven's sake. What did you expect?)<br />I have only given the album four stars out of five, becase there's two tracks I could have done without. &#34;The Christmas Blues&#34; because I think it's boring, and &#34;Must Be Santa&#34;. For some reason I don't like the insistent energy of the track together with the rest of the album. On the other hand, there's tracks I really love here. Just listen to Mr. Dylan perform &#34;I'll Be Home For Christmas&#34;. Unbelieveable!<br />So who would I recommend this album to? Anyone who like Bob Dylan obviously, and everyone who's looking for a Christmas album that are slightly different,yet familiar still. It does not hurt to have a sense of humor about it either. I'm pretty sure Mr. Dylan himself has had fun when making this album, and why is there a picture of nude model legend Betty Page on the inner sleeve, wearing a Christmas outfit? This album is great,odd,and funny all the way it seems. Wait until it's late at night Christmas eve, when the kids have gone to bed, and you're entering that reflective mood. Mix yourself a drink of choice, and put this album on the stereo. aaaahhhh, life is great.....
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app. I enjoy the fact that I can choose a winning hand or random choice of difficult deal.  Also the voices I am given on decks and other choices are nice for a free app. This is really nice.  I do hate the 20 word requirement though. I will state this for the record.<br />Is very nice. Thank you.<br />Scott
B005LAIIS0|4.0|I will preface this review by saying that Liam Neeson is probably one of my favorite movie tough guys working today.  When I hear that there was a movie out there that had him against a bunch of wolves, I was excited for the wold beatdown that I was about to witness.  I imagined Mr. Neeson going Rambo on these wolves, yelling, &#34;they drew first blood, not me!!!&#34;  I imagined him as some type of wilderness MacGuyver, whittling sticks and creating weapons of natural desctruction to take on his enemies.  Hey, I'm an animal lover, but I'm all for some movie magic involving some man versus wolf action.  I was pretty surprised (okay, maybe not THAT surprised) when the film did not turn out exactly like I had thought it would.<br /><br />This movie is actually pretty emotional.  And not in an, &#34;awww, poor guy/wolves,&#34; kind of way, more like a kick to the gut every now and then kind of way.  This was less action, more drama, and I loved every minute of it.  There is a little bit of gore in here, just in case you are squeamish, but it is not too bad.  The part of the movie leading up to the group being stranded in the wilderness is also pretty intense.  I enjoyed watching these people try to survive in this wilderness, and I genuinely felt for some of the characters when they were inevitably gobbled up by the wolves.  I can think of one death in particular in which I wanted to go full Darth Vader and scream, &#34;Nooooooooo,&#34; but luckily for those around me, I was able to contain it.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie if you're into tales of survival.  It is a pretty long movie, at just under 2 hours, but It did not feel like it was that long.  Those are my favorite kind of movies.  The acting is pretty good, even if there are some cheesy tough guy archetype moments.  The tough guy former inmate kind of irked me for a few minutes, but I even started to like him after a while.<br /><br />Go ahead and check this out on a cold and snowy night, and you will feel happy that you are indoors watching a movie and not stranded in some beautiful wilderness somewhere, with trees and mountaing, and wolves, oh my!!!  Actually, if you take away the stalking wolves, it sounds like a pretty decent vacation.  Do yourself a favor and bundle up and watch this flick!!!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|He's real and raw and in your face in the most subtle way. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' album The Heist isn't lacking in any way as far as I'm concerned. From the Tongue in Cheek &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; to the more poignant and honest &#34;Same Love&#34; this album packs not only a musical punch but lyrically - it'll leave you remembering it.
B0086700CM|4.0|The first day I got this game I played for hours. I really sucked at first, but after I got the hang of it I got 20,000 coins the first night.
0399226907|5.0|This book is being read at pk-4 level. 2 & 4 year old daughters love to read it before going to sleep.
B0047Y17P2|3.0|I like that Haller switched sides. Looking forward to the next book.  HALLER HAS TOO MUCH CONSCIOUS to be on the dark side. Besides now he can work WITH Bosch!!
0805092447|5.0|My 4 yr. old daughter read it a lot in Pk-3. She remembered the book and loves it! The edition itself was really small (approx 5x7in), wish I knew this before buying. Still love the book!
B00650SSDU|5.0|This movie is very funny. It has some intense moments and which makes the movie a whole lot better yea
B0015AARJI|5.0|I use this product everyday, its very useful for me, i liked it because of the low price and i really needed it.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|This movie is great. I especially like how it teaches tolerance, respect, self-expression, relationship repair, and conflict resolution. Also modelling.
B0091LS07E|5.0|one  of  her  best albums  yet  albums  yet  girl  on  fire  u  go  ms  keyes i loved this album thanks
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Intense story.  Keeps you guessing.  At times it was hard to read because cruelty is not easy to bear, even when reading about it.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I love country music and this CD has a few really great songs but I find myself skipping through most of them.  you would be better off getting two or three songs instead of spending the money for the entire cd
0765325950|1.0|They decided it would be best to kill a lot of trees than to release the book in any electronic format.  I started the series in 1984 and now will not buy the remaining book because of their arrogance and greed.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER TOR BOOK.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|fun to play with so many veriations but it tends to just close down for no reason..please fix than a five star. enjoyed the winter holiday background and music. maybe new one for sprkng.
B0030B624E|5.0|Hands-down, the best zombie flick ever. Period. Great script, great characters, and great acting. If you are debating, just WATCH IT.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|great android file management for your phone or Kindle!<br /><br />This makes finding files easy.<br /><br />Very useful if you are side-loading apps.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was well written and a great story.  I will be looking for more books by this author!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Anne Hathoway's emotion pours through her songs.<br />Hugh Jackman sounds great as Jean-Valjean.<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne as Marius, though, sounds a bit like kermit-the-frog.<br /><br />Overall, very well cast!
B0053JJLLC|2.0|When I first started reading Chrichton books, I was hooked.  His older books were awesome.  But, once he became more &#34;popular&#34; his newer novels all seemed to follow a standard formula.  After awhile, it made them really boring to read.  It has been several years since I read one, so I decided to give this one a try.  I instantly regretted it.<br /><br />This book is essentially adult version of &#34;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&#34;... Really?<br /><br />I forced myself to finish it and promptly warned my husband to forget it.  He decided to start reading it (against my advice) and walked away from it after the first chapter.<br /><br />Chrichton was gifted writer and truly original thinker.  I will miss him, but I won't miss his newest novels.
B00452J5IW|5.0|Apart from having heard \\"White Rabbit\\" & \\"Somebody To Love\\", I didn't know much about the Airplane/Starship family. I had a neighbor I used to smoke weed with, and Jefferson Airplane was about the only band he liked. Every time we were at his house it was Jefferson Airplane or Jefferson Starship. It wasn't long before I grew to love them, and even snatched up my own copies of their albums. One day I noticed \\"Blows Against The Empire\\" in his collection and I asked him if this was a good album. He played it for me and it seemingly transported my mind to another world! I'd never heard anything like it. I wanted one as soon as possible. The album tells the story of peace loving people who hijack a starship to start a better world somewhere out in space. The idea seems silly now, but it seemed a good imaginary way out of here at the time. This album really made me interested in the rest of Airplane's albums.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. I got involved with each character very quickly &  I felt like I was part of the story. My heart Turkey broke for Sky.<br />I almost didn't want it to end.a must read.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I was really into this book at first. The characters were interesting and the plot kept me turning the page. But about half way through I suddenly got bored with the whole thing and had a tough time finishing it.
B006R1T40I|5.0|This is classic Bonnie Raitt.  Such a stellar musician and singer.  You'll get your groove back on when she's playing. I love how thoughtful the lyrics are and as always she just seems to be on the same life path as me.
1451696191|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations. As a 16 year old girl I was anticipating a love story and I got exactly that but in a way I wasn't expecting. I found this book to be extremely relatable and heart-renching. I had to read it again and again because it was just so good. This book is written in a relaxed tone but it's very emotional. It's a page-turner, not in the way that makes you want to get to the ending, but in a way that makes you want to keep reading because you're enjoying it. I definitely recommend this book.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|I tore through this in about three days after I had surgery. Really fun military sci-fi adventure. Wish it was longer!
B003MC5N28|4.0|I read this book to preview it before gifting it to my 12 year old nephew. I wanted to make sure it is appropriate for his age. I did not expect to get sucked into the story as much as I did. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. My only complaint is that the ending was rather abrupt and didn't really leave me with any sense of resolution.
B003KJF2WE|4.0|Great movie.. a must see Rent it you won't be sorry if your a fan of the hulk.. and even if your not!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was a really great book. I love the series itself. One of my favorite book sets ever.can't get better than.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|A great game with really nice graphics.  Fun to play.  Great conceptually too.  Worth the price of admission.<br />I would make it a &#34;buy&#34;.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game plays really well on the Kindle, just like the real game! Fun for me as well as the kids.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This product does exactly what it says it will. It looks great and functions as promised. It has really kept my kindle in great shape.
8186336141|5.0|Very informative and a good read. Perfect for practicioners and teachers! Very interesting explainations of asanas as well as other daily practices.
0545128285|5.0|My favorite story in this book is the fortune fountain. Strongly Recommend to you. My friend borrowed it from me and she loved it too!
030746363X|4.0|I have to be honest.  I didn't read the entire book.  I was only interested in the quick weight loss.  It worked perfectly.  In fact, if I had not been lazy with my food preparation, I probably would have lost 25!
B002KFJWBG|5.0|A group whose songs are well loved. A group far ahead of their time, America caught on to their wonderful blend of rock and pop a little too late to keep the group going from their initial stage. The Zombies combine the great writing style of the Beatles with the great Beach Boy type harmonies to a sound uniquely their own.<br />Groups during this era came up with epic albums such as Pet Sounds and Sgt Peppers, the Zombie's Oracle and Odessey rates with the best of these!
B009SIE6AA|3.0|large variety of music styles; pretty easy listening; not the best, not the worst. I guess I'd buy it again
B004SEUIXS|5.0|My grandson played this movie for me. I just loved it. Bought one for me and a copy for a friend.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is a feel-good comedy with a lot of leading ladies. Girls can be funny too! Rebel Wilson is hilarious.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|very fun. kids and adults will enjoy.<br />I agree about the peanuts. there should be some way to win them.
141970642X|4.0|This book is enjoyable for fans of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books and/or movies. It was originally published after the first movie was released, and has been updated to include details from the second and third movies. I would definitely recommend it, and I think even kids who aren't into the series but who have an interest in movies or film making would enjoy it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great writing, acting, and story. What could be better? Looking forward to season 3. This is one of the best all-time series ever.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was simply amazing I could not put it down. I would recommend this book to someone who likes love stories.
B007L6VR12|5.0|If you've seen any Wes Anderson movies before, this is the epitome of his quirkiness. It might be too much for some people, but it's also a really fun movie. With it came a free amazon instant rental of the movie (for streaming). This was only active for a certain time after the purchase (maybe a month, but I forget). I didn't really care for that, and didn't think I would use it. However, a few days later with some friends it turned out to be a perfect way to watch the movie! The streaming worked great, and the idea of giving out a temporary free digital rental is a great one.
B009KHCT94|5.0|Pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. Good story, action, and special effects. Definitely worth at least a rental.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Felt quite uncomfortable reading this - the background storyline of Christian Grey is similar to a story I read years ago written by Lesley Pearse although I cant remember the title of the book so I had a large sense of de ja vu all the way though.  Really didn't live up to all the hype and if it werent for the fact I was on holiday and had run out of books then I probably still wouldnt have bothered. I know others have loved it and each to their own but I would label it fluffy kinky escapism and certainly wouldnt put it on my top ten list. Not greatly written; and, if you took out the kinky sex there would be bugger all else there.
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|The whole family enjoys this app. From 3 to 38, it is a fun little hit in our home! Thanks!
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Well written, informative and hard to put down :) First book ever brought for my kindle and well worth it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i have always love Greek mythology. but reading rick Riordan versions is 1000000 times better than what even i could of imagined!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|As usual found it hard to put down. I love the way Lee Child's writes these books; not only do you learn something along the way but they are gritty and give you a  kind of hope that not all is bad in the world..
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My first Stephen King book - I thought he wrote gruesome novels but this one is great!  It's a time travel back to the JFK assassination....
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I thought it was a search engine on it on but its not . deleted of my kindle fire HD within second. JS I do not recommend. :/
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I can't listen to this record too much. I seem to rotate and have different daily song favorites...they are all so good.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|this is a coming-of-age story like you've never read it before. it's funny in places, sad & depressing in others, and then, in the end, ultimately, heart-warming.<br /><br />the thing i loved most about it is the sense of the protagonist's journey you get from the book. you actually get to see how the hero changes, how does his outlook and view of his world change; how people around him change, you get to see for yourself the growing up part, coz Mr. Chbosky has written and executed this beautifully.
B009LA1QW6|3.0|This is really more like a addition to Born to Die (which I cannot get enough of). Blue Velvet is a delicious treat, I love Body Electric and Gods & Monsters is great too.  Yayo is the only track from Lana that I distinctly don't like...but you can't please everybody all the time.<br /><br />Gorgeous voice, great songs, wonderful records.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|people, make no mistake- David Mitchell does not play nice. he doesn't bring what he wanted to say  serving on a silver platter. he tells his story, and we, the readers, are required to keep up. the book makes you arrive at conclusions on your own, it makes you think, analyze and participate. that's what i loved about cloud atlas.<br /><br />don't get me wrong. this is an otherwordly book- the kind that makes you feel fortunate to be able to read. there aren't many books like this; coz despite being profound and thought-provoking, this book reads itself. it's still a page-turner.<br /><br />that's why, five stars.
0736092269|4.0|People actually thought this book was a text book because its so descriptive! It's great explains the muscles and workouts. Good to have
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I was playing  when I was over at my friends house and told her about it and she is almost at the same place I am in 1 hour . It took me 2 days to get there.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've had quite a lot of experience with other goo based building sims (GBBS) software, but World of Goo is quite superior to any other. Most GBBS software gives me too much room to shoot myself in the foot. Allowing multiple connections where I only wanted a few, connecting goo nodes too close to each other. the WoG GBBS has built in settings to keep me from connecting nodes that are too close, and if I happen to really try to, it'll automatically re-size the goo based connection to keep them apart.<br /><br />Also many other GBBS software providers haven't provided the level of automatic support that WoGGBBS provides. While I'm working, what I only assume are workers for the WoG corp (tm) occasionally pop up to talk to me about what I'm building and their opinion on how best to accomplish that task. (Although I have to admit all of them signing off as \\"the sign painter\\" was a bit hokey, but who am I to complain?)<br /><br />The software also allows for in flow communication with social media sites. I was quite surprised the first time I was working and my mother popped in just to say hi.<br /><br />All in all WoGGBBS is the best GBBS out there, and for all of you in the industry, this is the piece of software you've been looking for.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I first tried a sample of the book and after reading it, I knew I had to purchase the whole Kindle edition. I simply loved this book. I loved the intensity and passion of the chemistry between Holder and Sky. Every word that the author used to describe made me feel the emotions between Holder and Sky. I loved the twist of the 2nd half of the book. I loved how it was written so carefully as if the author was speaking to me, speaking out how I wouldve processed the delicate and sensitive events in the story. I loved how at the end of it all, it just gave me the opposite of its title. This book is dark but it is meant so that you would see the light at the end of the story. I will be reading more Colleen Hoover's books for sure!
B004ZNA5JO|3.0|This rating is for the 2011 release - NOT the album !!! I own this in the original vinyl, a cassette, and a 1990's CD issue. A friend dropped the 2011 version by for a comparrison. I used a dual tray player to make the comparison a bit easier and to keep everthing on a level playing field. The first thing that really jumped out at us was the lack of dynamics in this version. It is just not as engaging or as powerful as the earlier version. This is the same issue I had with the SACD of Wish You Were Here. Upon closer inspection, I discovered what I belive is the major differance - the earlier versions were mastered by Doug Sax - the \\"godfather of mastering\\" and supervised by James Guthrie. Mr. Guthrie took on this project without Mr Sax for this issue. WOW - what a differance. My suggestion is to stick with the older versions of these Floyd CD releases, if you must do digital.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|A wonderful read. Jaycee dugard is a truly inspirational woman! She was so brave through all of this and I am so happy she wrote this book. It really made me realize as I was reading that this can happen to anyone and we all need to be as aware as possible. This book was honest, true, and wonderful.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not Grisham's usual thought provoking work. Enjoyable, amusing and not much reality. The pace is quick and ended as expected.
B008M36EEI|4.0|This movie was intertaining and kept my attention. If you are into comedy romance then this film is a good bet.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app makes shopping on ebay way better and much easier. I love that you can save searches.  I like that it reminds me on my tablet when im outbid or if an items ending soon
B0094KF4WG|3.0|I started this book and, to begin with, fairly galloped though it. However, as I progressed I found that my attention slipping and by the time I finished, I had more or less lost interest.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Worst movie I remember watching. Waste of time and money.  I'd give it a  zero if I could.  Wish I had my money back.
B003EYVXYG|1.0|Survival of the Dead (George A. Romero, 2009)<br /><br />Diary of the Dead was, while not exactly a banner moment in George A. Romero's career, his best film in nigh on two decades (longer if you were one of the thousands who didn't like Monkey Shines nearly as much as I did). So, given that, what was his next move? Take a minor character from the movie, who appears very briefly, and make him the star of the next attempt to beat that (un)dead horse for just a little more cash. And I will admit (and I have said this before, specifically about Mr. Romero even) that if this were not a George A. Romero zombie movie, I would probably not have hated it nearly as much as I did. But in this case, I'm not sure that argument applies, because I'm not sure that anyone other than George Romero could have made Survival of the Dead. Which makes it even more painful to say that this movie is, to date, the nadir of Romero's career--and I say this as someone who sat through both There's Always Vanilla and Jack's Wife.<br /><br />Plot: Nick Crockett (Immortals' Alan van Sprang), whom we last saw shaking down the film crew in Diary of the Dead, is leading a ragtag band of ex-military types through the zombified landscape, living off their wits, when they stumble upon a radio transmission straight out of 28 Days Later... advertising a zombie-free island. They decide to check it out and, to make a long story short, find themselves stuck in the middle of a long-standing feud between the island's two patriarchs, Patrick O'Flynn (The Aviator's Kenneth Welsh) and Seamus Muldoon (The Boondock Saints' Richard Fitzpatrick), one of whom wants to eradicate the island's undead inhabitants, the other trying to find a way to restore their humanity.<br /><br />In short: take everything you loved about Dawn of the Dead and elevate it to parody levels. Thirty-five years ago, Dawn's brilliant, hilarious, over-the-top gore sequences were accents that pinned together a story with just enough social consciousness to leave a bitter taste in the mouth, with enough rough edges to abrade without ever cutting. Here, we find that the outrageous gore sequences aren't accents, they've become the entire story, with the social consciousness aspect of the film relegated to one scene at the end that's just painful to watch. We've gone from Ken Foree's immortal \\"when there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth\\" to this nonsense?<br /><br />I hate this movie. I hate that I've seen this movie. I hate that this movie got made. (zero)ousness to leave a bitter taste in the mouth, with enough rough edges to abrade without ever cutting.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love Stephen King so the first purchase for my Kindle had to be a book by him. Love it so far (63% complete) and love my Kindle as well.
B000F9RB8K|5.0|Even though it is a classic movie I really enjoy see in it over and over again. I really got it for a good price
0142001104|4.0|I would start by reviewing Benjamin Zander videos on You Tube. Then you will understand the man behind the message (or half the message I suppose, since his wife is co writer and she adds good substance to the total message). I first came to this book after seeing Mr. Zander live at a conference and I thought he was fantastic. The book seems a bit harder to get excited about without the video support - in my mind. But overall, as a package, the videos, and then the book are worthwile for the really low cost. I plan to buy some of Mr. Zanders classical music CD's which are also on Amazon. D.W.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Even though it is a classic movie I really enjoy see in it over and over again. I really got it for a good price
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome it is so fun but....I can't find any blocks of gold or diamonds etc but it's awesome please help anyone with the gold :)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Even though it is a classic movie I really enjoy see in it over and over again. I really got it for a good price. Now I have the 3 movies so my saga it is complete
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Only the first half is free but it's completely worth it. Puzzle games like this one are good for the brain. At first I was hesitant to purchase the second half of the game, but I eventually did because I can't just leave a game unfinished. It's cheap and worth the purchase. I enjoyed the story line and will definitely be purchasing another as G5 game! This was right up my alley.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|A Most have for all music lovers, Having in Blu-ray is even better, music is cleaner, picture is shaper, like I am there
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This book was so beautifully written, I really enjoyed it.  The differences between the family life of the rich and poor was very well created.  I like how after the accident the guy was humbled but couldn't accept what life had doled out to him.  I think I would prefer to be dead than to live like he was expected to do just to keep his parents happy.  I would highly recommend it.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|I was disappointed that u need a Facebook to save your game or even have neighbors. Im only 13 and don't have a Facebook. But my little brother got on my kindle fire and removed the game from my device! I lost my leap year dragon my blue moon dragon my moon and Sun my apocalypse dragon and many more limited time once every three or four year dragons I had higher expectations for the backup systems. Dragon story has a good system u don't need a Facebook. it saves automatically and has great graphics. This game I would still play it if u have a Facebook. I wish that they can work out the bumps because this is a truly good game but I  don't approve of the system. If u agree &amp; r on dragon story feel free to add me my ID is batmanlovesme
B00992CF6W|1.0|this game is so boring and terrible i  cried on how badand expensive it was worst flippin game ever if i were you i wouldnt get it i wantmy money back
B00AECDDYY|4.0|This is a good and addictive game, but there aren't enough levels.  I finished all of them within a week or so.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I loved how author showed so much detail  and said what day it was and how it was going .
B0037QM8YA|3.0|The movie did a good job conveying the message from the book, while keeping some dignity for Precious. I would recommend this movie to adults.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|There are five main characters whose engaging personalities blossom and change throughout the story.  A delightful gem and unexpected surprise.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|Really nothing to say except that it is a great ending to a great series. Highly recommend to anyone who loves the books.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I already submitted this review.  A film worth seeing for its acting and content, but Neeson's character is over the top!
B0091REZMW|4.0|my kids and I play this game often. its fun for all of us. I just wish you could make friends faster.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A very believable scary scenario. Jack Ryan Jr. Is a beast! I wish JACK SR. was our president, I`d feel a lot better about our future possibilities! Here`s to hoping China doesn't have a real version of Dr. K.K. Tong.
B003O86FMW|3.0|If you liked the style or writing of the first book, &#34;Catching Fire&#34; provided a quick and good read.  The quirky details of fighting the games were easy to skip over lightly in order to read Collins' final chapter.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is wonderful...I<br />would give it 10 stars if I could. I have the UK version and it is the way to go. PBS is pretty choppy on the editing but still good.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. I just finished watching it and totally regret having my 2 hours wasted on a film with illogical story plot, too stupid characters who are supposedly scientists, bad dialog...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love playing this game, I don't like waiting for the coins to regenerate. my husband and I fight over whose turn it is..
B009JBZH54|5.0|Aswome movie great deal for three bluerays love the box it comes with & each movie is in order as you open the box
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is trueley one of the best games I have ever played it is very addicting I can't take my eyes of it and just like Minecraft for the pc
1407130293|4.0|This was the easiest way I have found to purchase the books I like plus being able to ship them to someone else.  So easy.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|oh my god i love this game i can play it for hours at a time. when i got it i was so addicted to it
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the awesomist game ever in the world nothing could beat except for facebook everyone who's reading this buy no mather how much it cost
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Thankfully this game has finally been released on the kindle.  Love it on ipad hopefully it will be better on android.
B004JK61K0|5.0|K-9 mail came to my rescue when I wasn't able to get my current service loaded on my smart phone.  I'm happy with K-9 mail.
B005K2YRVG|4.0|I liked this sleeve, but have switched to the book type because I wanted to hook my light to it for night reading.  With this sleeve you can't do that.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This really is one huge honking cpu cooler. Be aware that if you intend to use this cooler in a non-newer generation gaming case, you may not be able to get the side panel on your case. Luckily I was building a new gaming rig with a wide enough case. I did do the measurements on a couple of other cases that I have and sure enough this cpu cooler would have protruded beyond the width of those cases.<br /><br />Otherwise this is a well built and suitable cooler for some pretty impresive cpu's. It keeps my new quad core running at less than 35 degrees celcius at 100% load with artic silver thermal paste and a second fan added to the Hyper 212.<br /><br />Be aware that the images are missleading. The cooler only comes with one fan. I added a second fan myself...
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this story as it folded, unfolded, took hard left turns and kept me guessing the whole way. This was my first Gillian Flynn novel and I was smitten. Her writing is lots of fun and unexpected, the characters deeply thought out and brought to life. I enjoyed it a lot.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I had only seen the movie before but this book has so much more and better story. The characters more filled out and story less rushed. I understand d now why there was only one movie but this series went on for so very long.
1926778537|5.0|great book ,awesome game the both make the perfect match if your a game art lover. mad designs and great art
B00003CXCS|5.0|My 10 yr old daughter loves musicals!  She was so excited to get it for Christmas! It came quickly and in great shape!
1781164150|5.0|from concept to finish designs ,great shapes and design a great book if you loved the art style and learning animation.
B002MXA7TC|5.0|I keep rediscovering this album each time i decide to give it a go in my car.  I swear I never get bored or used to this album...some really good stuff.  I wanna say a lot more people should know about them but at the same time I have a selfish wish that they don't become too popular since this will inevitably be followed by a decline in the quality of their product (isn't that how it usually goes once a band is \\"out there\\"? *sigh*).  This is definitely one of my favourite albums of all time and has never left my car's disc changer since I put it in there in 2010.
0425263908|3.0|When I got this book, I was excited. It ended up being okay. Now what I was looking for but, I will continue to finish the series since I started it.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed the story line in this HO game.  It was challenging and I must admit I used the game guide frequently.  The graphics were great and I am looking forward to a sequel.
B005LAII12|5.0|Seth Rogen is a genious.  This raucously funny movie will have you laughing so hard that you may very well pee yourself.  I saw this in the theatres when it came out and I wanted to own the DVD, just so I can watch it over and over.
B009C7JS14|3.0|more up to date than your local news --I use it a lot has not let me down--worth the price
B007PVHANM|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this film about Bob Marley.  I'm a Marley fan and also being a Jamaican made me want to check this out.  I have nuff respect for Bob and what he has done for reggae music.  It really takes a hero to have gone through what he has gone through and still hold true to his faith, his religion and his country.  Plus I love the fact that he has some handsome a** sons, lol.
B00A6SZRGS|5.0|i had some small doubts that they would top their last album but black veil brides have proved me wrong.<br />wretched & divine is without a doubt the album this band was created to make,<br />from start to finish wretched & divine has a style that only BVB could pull off with such aplomb.<br />especially shocking was the fact that the single in the end which is a song i love isn't the best song on the album,<br />which just goes to show how well BVB have managed to create this masterpiece that stands as a testament to their talent<br />listen out especially for jinxx's skill with the violin used beautifully in track 10 OVERTURE.<br /><br />to all BLACK VEIL BRIDES fans who haven't yet bought this album get it bought now you will not be disappointed,<br />to all non-fans buy it any way it's a work of pure genius that can never be repeated.<br /><br />just for some clarification the deluxe edition which i bought does not contain the movie as some fans seem to believe<br />it contains a dvd with behind the scenes footage of the making of the album.<br />unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a release date for the movie yet at least not to my knowledge.<br />hopefully it will be soon though.
B009369Z8A|5.0|Based upon the dates of some of the reviews, they were written and submitted before this Blu-ray set was ever released to the public.  Those reviewers apparently reviewed this DVD set based upon the theatrical release of the movie.  I enjoyed Lawless in a big-screen movie theater and appreciated it enough to want to own it on DVD.<br /><br />There have already been so many heartfelt and passionate comments published here about the movie itself, its acting and plot, ranging from \\"love\\" to \\"hate\\" therefore I will not focus on those aspects other than to repeat my review's headline; \\"If you loved the move, you'll like this DVD set.\\"  These disks obviously will not make you like the movie if you hated it in the theater, do not like violence, period movies or do not like having to focus on details and sometimes obscure dialog in order to keep up with the plot and character development.<br /><br />There is graphic violence and a considerable amount of artistry in how the sets, music, sounds and costumes were created and filmed.  Those were reproduced well both in Blu-ray and on the standard DVD.  Colors, details and the visual dynamic range and audio were captured well on disk.  I enjoyed the bonus feature, which included comments from most of the leading actors except for Gary Oldman, about how they worked together to create this movie.  Using foreign actors to play the leading parts no doubt required considerable dialog coaching to make this movie, set in rural Virginia, seem authentic.<br /><br />This movie was based upon real events in America's past during Prohibition and does a good job, in my opinion, of taking you there.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Not a bad overall plot to the movie. I guess I was looking for more action. If that's what you're hoping the movie just drags on and on.
B004EBUXI0|3.0|Well for a use product it works but seem to be sputtering here and there because of being overclocked and the fan did not come with the shipment.

B0033YAU3M|5.0|Got this as a gift for a book lover with very high standards.  She loves it and wouldn't change a thing!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am enjoying exploring Pintrest and I am fascinated by the many things on it. However, becasue of the many things on it the text information is in such tiny print that it is difficult to read. I will have to explore to see if there is any way to correct that situation. There is so much on Pintrest....it is going to consume hours of my time!...Love it!
B001EAWME2|5.0|Black Christmas tells the story of a psychotic serial killer stalking and disturbing a group of college students at a sorority house. Black Christmas is a creepy, unsettling, and atmospheric slasher.<br /><br />The story in this film is creepy, although recognizable; if you're familiar with urban legends, you'll probably be able to guess some of the twists and scenes in this movie; I won't go into detail, so I can avoid spoilers. My favorite scenes in this film involved the creepy and unsettling phone calls; these phone calls are extremely disturbing because of how well-done they are. The wicked, unforgettable voice was truly chilling. This film also effectively uses suspense, especially in the scenes where our disturbed killer is stalking. There is a scene that does follow the same horror formula that some people get mad at; a main character is told to do something by the police (logical), she does the opposite (illogical). This scene didn't really hurt the film because it leads to a suspenseful ending and an amazing \\"eye\\" scene, that I won't spoil any further. It also has some humorous scenes that actually work. The film moves at a fast pace, and had great acting and music.<br /><br />I own the Blu-Ray of this film. The picture and sound quality has definitely been updated from previous versions, so you will see a difference. However, it's not the best upgrade, so don't expect something like the \\"Blade Runner\\" release. It does have some special features like trailers and a few interviews.<br /><br />Overall, Black Christmas is an exceptional slasher; it has has the suspense and brutality you'd expect in a slasher, and has extremely disturbed villain. I highly recommend a purchase.<br /><br />Black Christmas has strong violence and blood, no sex or nudity.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Lemony snicket did a great job writing this book with lots of action and unfortunate events. A great book for kids

This is a big waste of time and money .I really can't understand you miss treating  your fans like this.But buy this bulls*** and you will be so sorry. A big fan of a lot of the sound you make but damn. WAITING ALL THAT TIME FOR THIS........PLEASE CAN I HAVE MY MONEY BACK , I  will never buy anymore music from you unless I can hear a sample of each song first. You  should stop selling this now !.....this is a so so single for $21, come on Prince !!!!!!!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I don't remember Bourne taking any pills in the other movies or having to come in every so often to get new ones so for that reason I found this movie disconcerting. the only thing that saved it was the beautiful scenery.
B003GERM08|1.0|It's the worst thing of my life, for reals it made me cry... Not gonna lie, it's horrible, don't get it.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|As a fan of the show, I had to try one of these books.  The characters are great, like fictional characters based on the fictional characters from the TV show.  Brilliant.  The book was a quick read, that kept me engaged, and came off much like a show (but with a little more that you cant put on TV, so some of the characters are spiced up).  All in all, good book.
B000JML7EC|3.0|Was a great read I enjoyed it a great deal I hope if you haven't read it that you will give it a try
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I would have given this 5 starts (especially for the price reduction) but there were a few songs missing that I wish had been included.  I was shocked when Hugh Jackman and Anne Hatheway were in this, but was amazed by their performance on the screen (and on this CD).  Totally a great buy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book so far. I love having this on my kindle. I can't stop reading it. It keeps you locked in. Thanks

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the story from beginning then the twist made it a fascinating and interesting and addicting tale. It's a tear jerked and emotional story ... I could not put it down!
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|Everything was good. Only complaint I heard is that it did not come with enough bullets to fill up the gun.

B004SIIBGU|4.0|Its now much easier to navigate the eBay auctions. Good application and runs well on the smaller Kindle Fire HD.
B003UYUP58|4.0|I chose 4 stars rather than 5. The history is interesting and well written. Although stories were told of different patients, not enough truth of the suffering in \\"the cure\\" was exposed. Nausea, yes, but nothing about having chemo drugs oozing out of your pores, having infected fingernail and toenail beds or possibly a psychotic brain chemical reaction to chemo. The \\"new normal\\" of cancer survivors was described only in terms of chess play between ones cancer and drugs. No mention of quality of life after treatment with damaged veins, chronic pain, weight gain and neuropathy, to name just a few. Yes, theres a war on cancer. As in most wars the people planning the attack are rarely the people in the trenches.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone. As the author says, \\"We are all touched by cancer.\\"
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|great plot, fun new author, can't wait for the next book in the trilogy. kept me guessing until the end.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Well it was a good kids book full of fantasy and imagination.  I have ser the movie many times and thought I would check out the books.
B009YQJ322|5.0|You're being hunted, outnumbered, you're unable to escape. To make matters worse, your only ally is inexperienced and you have a prisoner whose safety is your responsibility. What do you do?<br /><br />  The majority of the United States is now uninhabitable, thanks to radiation. Those areas are referred to as The Cursed Earth. Mega-City One, one of the habitable areas, is a large violent metropolis containing close to one billion people and suffering 17,000 violent crimes a day. The only bulwark maintaining some semblance of order is the greatly outnumbered Judges. Despite their name, they perform the same tasks as police officers in addition to carrying out the duties of determining guilt and imposing sentence. One such man is Judge Dredd (played by Karl Urban). Dredd (Urban) is well-known among his fellow Judges for his uncompromising nature and stiff sentences. Against his will, Dredd is ordered by his superior to evaluate a young officer who failed her exams but was offered the chance to be a Judge because of her psychic abilities, caused by the radiation and making her part of a societal caste referred to as \\"mutants\\". The young rookie (played by Olivia Thirlby) is named Cassandra Anderson and, while Dredd wears a helmet throughout the entire film, she elects not to for fear that it will inhibit her psychic abilities. Simultaneously, in a 200-story slum referred to as The Peach Trees, a crime boss named Madeline Madrigal, also known as Ma-Ma, (played by Lena Headey) has three men drugged, skinned, and dropped from a high floor in The Peach Trees. Dredd and Anderson are informed via radio and arrive at the scene to investigate. Anderson's psychic abilities allow her to identify one of the perpetrators almost immediately, causing Dredd to take the man into custody so he can be interrogated back at the Judges' headquarters. Something Ma-Ma cannot allow. And the hunt begins.<br /><br />  Now, I have seen the 1995 Sylvester Stallone movie which was inspired by the same source material. In fact, I've seen it many times. I'm not proud of it, but it's true. While this film doesn't explore Dredd's origins or allow the same \\"growth\\", I'd say Dredd succeeded where its predecessor failed. No, it doesn't have Rob Schneider to offer comic relief or Diane Lane and Joan Chen as strong and attractive female characters, but the cat-and-mouse game Headey's character and the illustration of the drug referred to as Slo-Mo more than compensate. It doesn't break new ground or challenge the actors, save for Headey who is forced to appear unattractive onscreen for the first time in her career, but it is highly entertaining and I enjoyed it a great deal.same source material.

1401207529|5.0|I bought this comic book with the expectation that this was the inspiration from Christopher Nolan and David Goyer for Batman Begins screenplay. I will never be dissapointed, Frank Miller really took Batman to the next level. He´s the true influence for the dark knight that we know in the present. This is a very valuable item in my small comic collection, buy i promess it´ll be enormous.<br />  I could note many details taken from this comic that were incorporated in the Nolan´s movie, and it was a passionated quest compare all those facts matching. It worth it.<br />  Now i understand that the comic books are a very important art expression in the culture of the world. This is my favorite hero (Well, he says he´s not a hero), and his origins in the comics always will be a precedent for any animated or real motion picture. I recommend it.

B0000C83YJ|5.0|Culture Club is my very favorite 80's group and this brilliant album still stands the test of time after all these years. Every song is so great to listen to and you will never get tired of hearing it. This is most definitely their very best album. This album is a must have for all fans of Culture Club and fans of 80's music.
B002KKCWP4|5.0|Living in the tropics, I wear sandals quite a bit, especially when out on the boat, fishing, at the marina/docks, or just hanging out. I've gone through all kinds of sandals and Crocs (the clog kind) and have had tremendous problems with durability, comfort and support.  I recently discovered these by accident and and so glad I did.  These eliminate all those problems and are so comfortable that I scarcely even remember they are on.  I can wear them all day long, fish all day in them, continue wearing them throughout the evening and they remain comfortable and supportive.  I love that about these and I'll never go back to anything else.  In fact, I've bought additional pairs since I discovered them.<br /><br />Additionally, the straps on these are extremely secure, making sure the sandals stay in place while also allowing for precise adjustment for maximum comfort.  The soles are thick and sturdy, perfect for wearing in any environment; from ocean/river/backwater bottom, to sand, to grass, to dock, to street, etc.  Very sturdy, very solid.<br /><br />Highly recommend these.

B008R9QAY6|5.0|When I listened to this recording for the first time, words like \\"Stunning\\" and \\"staggering\\" came to mind!! The singing of ALL the principals is simply \\"WOW!\\" Did the castrati sound nearly this good or as good as this?! If so, we really missed being alive in the Baroque era! It would be difficult to single out the best of the principals, so I won't try. I'll just say again - WOW!! And don't leave out the instrumental ensemble: clarity, beautiful playing, and the apparent leadership from the conductor of monumental. All in all, an absolutley TERRIFIC production, one that should be heard by all musicians, from students to professional, who desire to experience Baroque opera!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was so well written and so realistic that the story seemed more fact than fiction. This was an adventure story in its truest form. I was unable to put it down untill the end!
B004132HZS|5.0|Great writing, stories, acting and charachter interaction. Why can't U.S. networks produce shows of this caliber. Cumberbatch and Freeman have a great chemistry as Holmes & Watson. Their dead pan responses to each other are both funny and fit each one's charachter. Anyone who has enjoyed reading the original stories or the Jeremy Brett episodes will enjoy this series immensely.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I read this at a recommendation for \\"What to read after 50 Shades of Grey\\". Had I not read it based on that, I might have a slightly different reaction to the book. This was a poignant and emotional story.  It was well-written and for that I would give it more stars. I enjoyed the story overall.  However, I was very uncomfortable with how descriptive and steamy it was with charcters who were 17 years old.  It just didn't sit well with me as I was reading through this book. If you are reading this because you are looking for something \\"similar\\" to 50 shades, this is not the book! If you are looking for an engaging, poignant and very emotional story, you will not be disappointed.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is very addictive and works wonderfully on my 1st Gen Kindle Fire. Also unlike other games there is actual strategy involved and the same strategy doesn't work for all levels.  Some reviews complain that it is a money chaser... I don't think so.  You can go ahead and pay to unlock levels if you want to, but isn't the point to play the game.  If you win a stage it unlocks the next stage for free.
B001NXDSLQ|4.0|this was an interesting product, purchased it for a school project but still fun to watch, bit of music history
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|great game! the world that we have to explore is very rich in detail. and very creepy to boot. story line is pretty good although in the description it says a young girl is missing which is false. other than that...completely. worth the money awesome game!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Proof of Heaven is a well written and interesting little book about Dr. Eben's experience with what he perceives as a visit to the &#34;after-life&#34;.  But medical observation of a patient from the &#34;outside&#34; doesn't reveal what a comatose patient is perceiving, sensing, imagining or feeling on the &#34;inside&#34;.  After-life remains a mystery if, indeed, it exists at all.

B009CFYRCG|5.0|A great Cohn brothers movie. The characters are each rich in details and storyline is original. Jeff Bridges character of the dude is now legendary.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|You just can't go wrong with the Wimpy Kid series of books.  The movies are hilarious as well although they don't mirror the books, but this is pretty common with just about any book-to-movie I've ever been familiar with.  Safe for the entire family with just a minimum amount of crude humor that my kids are to young to catch on to.

B0086700CM|5.0|My review of this game:<br />Absolutely amazing it's very addictive. And if your a first timer you basically run away  from evil monkeys and you have to go through obstacles throughout the game. But recently I've had an issue with the app the runner won't move side to side. He/she I use both. They only stay in one place like middle or left or right. Unless I handle it manually. But when I do that I bump into one of the obstacles and it sucks any solution? Please help with that. I wrote this big paragraph and I'm only gonna turn 14 on the 12 of 2013.  :D I feel smart and creative... O_o  happy early birthday to me! :D

B003O86FMW|5.0|I do not know how Suzanne Collins thinks of these things but I finished this book in a day. I couldn't stop turning the page. She has a very distinct way of capturing you and not a single page bored me. Also great ending I really did not have any clue that was coming. I really wish the next book was not the last, but I suppose I will have to go read and find out. Simply amazing!
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|In line with pretty much all the movies in this series, Retribution brings the same action and fun sci fi element.  The later films certainly have a higher budget which makes the special effects much better.  My only critique is that most of the action takes place in doors and in tight coradors giving the films a claustrophobic feeling but this doesnt detract too much from the films.  I would recomend this film to anyone who enjoys sci fi horror or who has enjoyed previous films in this series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it. !!!! ! ! !#!#!#! ! ! ! ! ! ! !#! # ! ! ! ! ! !

1455502758|4.0|Too short, too long, not enough on mortality, too much of that, etc. etc.  I don't care.  I was honored to read the final writings of Christopher Hitchens, a great man, great orator and true intellect.  He is missed and I doubt we'll see the likes of him again. I agree the last few pages filled with a collection of random notes and musings was the most moving part of the book.  Here's to you, Hitch.

B007704HO6|4.0|The warmth and caring between James and Bob quite obviously saved both their lives.  This is a lovely book for any animal lover to read and enjoy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played many rounds of Solitaire!  I like this!  I've won many times and I do not like losing over and over, so this game is fun!
B00005QFE5|5.0|This was a gift for our daughter. We also have this movie and rate it very highly. It is a wonderful study in Chinese relationships and is visually beautiful. We would recommend it to anyone.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is my favorite Angry Birds game of them all!  I love the music!  It reminds me of the theme from Mork & Mindy!  LOL  This is fun the way the birds scream as they fly into space across the stars!  LOL
B0072PUC7W|5.0|This was a gift for our son-in-law. He likes it very much, though it probably isn't a style that we would particularly enjoy.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|This reminds me of the actual arcade pin ball games where I inserted many quarters. I think this will be fun!
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This is nothing short of amazing.  The blend and range of music is well balanced and keeps you entertained from begining to end.  Discovered them when I saw the video for Brezeblocks, an incredible journey that keeps you wondering.  Thanks Alt-J.
1603429999|5.0|This is an interesting book as I never thought of using circular needles to make flat projects.  This workshop also lends itself towards instilling confidence in the knitter and the facility and ease of maintaining consistency while all together on one extended length needle.  I found the layout and design easy to follow and will be referring back often for new ideas.
034580404X|5.0|Loved the deal I got on these books!  Can't wait to read them over and over again, lol!!! They are such a good read!
B00005N6KG|1.0|the headphones didn't fit the cd player I bought them for so I can't use them. I'm thinking about giving them to some one who can use them.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I've really enjoyed this book by a new -to- me author.  Ready to but the sequel!  In due Did Baldacci is on his way to becoming one of my favorites.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|Isaw the original movie with KurtRussell and it fell in with how the space ship got their in the first place.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|bought it new.  I've watched it a few times already.  Loved it in the theater, love it more at home.
B004EPYZXK|1.0|It was a lousy movie . It didn't make much sense. I'm sorry I bought it.and I wish I could give it away but know one wants it.
030759565X|5.0|Arrived like new.  Looks in perfect condition.  I'm so excited to have this and be able to use it.  Price was GREAT.  What an exceptional deal.
B000089A06|5.0|Silence of the Lambs was a great flick. The iconic performances, passionate score and excellent screenplay have been praised by everyone from critics to the Academy Awards. It's younger sibling Red Dragon, however, remains critically underrated in my not-so-humble opinion. Tally's screenplay is as excellent as his opus for Silence and the Harris's story is well-paced and told very compelling. Elfman's score is as wonderfully gothic and frightening as the rest of his well-known works. Ratner's directing is very tight and the shots are quite well-done (although I am no expert on cinematography.)<br /><br />Norton plays Graham, the tortured, semi-psychotic, no-nonsense FBI special agent very well (although I may be biased due to my major dude-crush on him.) Hopkins plays a slightly more chilling and horrific Lecter than his previous role in Silence. Fiennes really digs into the tragedy of The Tooth Fairy, playing his struggle against his own personal demons quite splendidly. Harvey Keitel does a great job playing the dude from the National Treasure movies. Emily Watson plays a wonderfully vulnerable and sweet Reba McClane (no relation to the dude from Die Hard.) Mary Louise Parker is a good actress. And Phillip Seymour Hoffman played a great pompous douchebag.<br /><br />If you're still reading this review, you have too much time on your hands. Go see the world, write a book, save a princess, get a life but before you do all that, watch this movie.
B004MYFV0O|5.0|It's very helpful and this is what a beginner wants. Very nicely and logically presented .the author holds your hand through out and it's such a comfort.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case I bought was a fraudulent copy of life proof!<br />When my life proof case broke after only a week, I called life proof to have it replaced they told me it was a counterfeit! So Becareful what your buying.
0345803507|5.0|From: Christina<br />Subject: Thank you...<br />Date: January 21, 2011 14:45<br />To: Christian Grey<br /><br />Dear Mr. Grey,<br /><br />I have had a pleasant time getting to know you and your wife. I am surely pleased to know that you have changed and see more about yourself and your family over the short amount of time have known Mrs. Grey. I am going to miss your story and your control freak ways but even I know people need their privacy.<br /><br />I just wanted to thank you and Mrs. Grey for everything that you have done and shared with your fans. Your story has piqued many people's interest including myself. As you know, time heals all wounds and so does love and I am glad you are able to love and be loved by other people again. Do not be overwhelmed and conscience about your life and please try to control your anger. I am sure Dr. Flynn, even though patient, can get a bit flustered by your errant behaviour and try not stress yourself. I am sure Mrs. Grey will take great care of you and will not see harm come to you as you will not see it come to her no matter how frustrating she is but she means well.<br /><br />Make due with your life and continue on to be a possessive, controlling, protective, stubborn man. But promise me one thing, please do not let anything get in your way. No matter the consequences that come into your life at full force. Push through them and you will be all right. And remember, behind every man is a woman and that woman is your wife.<br /><br />As always Mr. Grey. I thank you again for your time and patience. And oh, stow your twitchy palm for your wife later and do not worry about her too much. Even I can see she is a remarkable, strong woman who loves you more than you know and yes, you do deserve it and think of yourself as much as you think about Mrs. Grey.<br /><br />It is always a pleasure talking to you Mr. Grey and I hope you and your family has a wonderful, fulfilling life.<br /><br />Sincerely, Christina.<br />(P.S. Phoebe is a beautiful name.) :)s a beautiful name.) :)
B005AERS74|5.0|Need some great music then get this. Great to listen to anytime and the sound it great. This is a good value from Amazon. Get you some.
0142419400|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Anna and the French Kiss did not disappoint me at all!<br />First of all, I let my friend borrow the book from me and she said she loved so much also. She wanted to borrow it for a while so she can read it again. And again, and again. I had to wrestle it from her to get my book back but now another friend of mine is reading it and I hope she loves also.<br /><br />Anyways, Anna and the French is about Anna being sent to Paris for boarding school because of her successful author dad. Leaving her little brother and friends was difficult for her (difficult for anyone) especially the guy she likes but all that is left in Atlanta and moving to Paris changes everything.<br /><br />Once in Paris's school for American teens she struggles to learn the ways of Paris, finding the nearest cinema (if Paris has any), and coping with the irresistible St. Clair: perfect, Parisian, and utterly irresistible (sorry had to repeat it because those are the best ways to describe him) but also taken.<br /><br />Dealing with things all Paris things change for everyone back home in Atlanta, all the while, St. Clair struggles to get past his controlling father who wont let him see his mother who is sick. The only way to fix both of their problems is each other.<br /><br />Everyone must read this book!
B003Y3UNZW|4.0|I like Katy's music because it high energy and I can understand what she sings about. I love downloading music from Amazon mostly because it's affordable and they have a great selection. Thanks
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so beautiful. It gives me hope for love. And there's so many twists and turns. I couldn't stop reading it. I felt everything the characters were feeling.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I was prompted to read this book after I saw the new movie previews.  I plan to see the movie when it comes out in theaters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was  a great read! I couldn't put it down! Never a dull moment! Had some very inspiring words of encouragement and love!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really liked the book, and the ending of the series.  I loved the story and how it gave closure to it.  I totally recommend the series!
B000L53D4O|4.0|Fun toy stable for babies just learning to stand.  Babies like the spinning ball on front also.  Encourages baby to take steps.  We found it helpful for our sons development.  It did not inhibit him from walking independently.
0765325950|1.0|I see a lot of people bemoaning the 1-star ratings that are lowering the overall rating for the publishers/writers choice of delaying the eBook 3 months.  Saying ratings should be for the content of the book and not for the choice of delayed publishing of an eBook.  I call that hogwash!  After voicing a complaint to the publisher via their website, what other mean is there of voicing the displeasure MANY feel about the delaying of the eBook format.  If lowering the rating hurts the sales of the Hardcover, and the reason for that is the low rating from people that want an eBook format at the same time of a Hardcover.  Then so be it.  It seems the only way to make a business even think of changing their ways is to hit them in the cash register.<br /><br />So all you eBook readers out there, I hope you continue to give this Hardcover version a 1-star rating!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its useful and has so far improved my relationship with the Lord. I don't really know what is would have done if I wouldn't have the Holy Bible on the go with me.
0765325950|1.0|I've been a fan to WoT since I was a teenager. I've also been a fan of ebooks ever since they came out. This decision, has cost her (Harriet, Robert Jordans widow), my business. I woke up this morning excited to buy AMoL on Amazon. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when I discovered that there was no ebook. I did some google searching and found the release date was set for April. This is unacceptable. I will NOT be buying this book in physical form at all. And to be quite honest, because of this decision, I'm going get it electronically in a few days, without spending a dime. This is the only way I can express my displeasure at this decision. I'm glad this is the last book. I want to finish it, then have NOTHING ELSE to do with Jordans widow, or her prejudices. Let me repeat myself and make sure I'm totally clear, I was perfectly, willingly, and eagerly ready to purchase the ebook version of AMoL this morning. No longer. Money decision? Guess what, you lose. No money out of me. Someone mentioned earlier that it's a NY Time best seller list decision, I call BS on that, since the NY Times has included Ebooks into their metrics for several years now.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game rocks because the games are fun and easy to play and it has a lot of fun games i think this is the best game ever
B007704HO6|5.0|Have to admit I'm one of those who freely skims and rarely finishes a book.  That was not the case with this book.  It is uplifting to see how this special feline lifted his rescuer out of a self-destructive lifestyle.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is written fantastically. I have  absolutely no complaints about it. It's great and wonderful. Charlie, Sam, and Patrick are some of the most well written characters.
0756697875|5.0|Great book w/ bonus exclusive batman mini figure. The photos are excellent resources for building more super hero lego fun.
B000007MVD|4.0|If you liked The Beatles Anthology series, you'll like this. A good listen to the songs the band cut their teeth on as they were coming up thru the clubs. Recorded at BBC in the first couple years of Beatle stardom.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The kids can relate to the characters from the movies and love the games and videos embedded within the village.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|If you are a bibliophile, techno-geek, and lover of puzzles, then this book is for you.<br /><br />The protagonist, Clay, has lost his job at NewBagel because of the recession. He's desperate for new employment. At first, he sets his sights high--he'll only work for a company with a mission he believes in, but he finally settles on it \\"just not being evil.\\" Out for a walk, he finds a help-wanted sign:<br /><br />\\"Whenever I walked the streets of San Francisco, I'd watch for HELP WANTED signs in the windows--which is not something you really do, right? I should probably be more suspicious of those. Legitimate employers use Craigslist.\\"<br /><br />He lands a job as midnight-shift clerk at Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. The store doesn't get many visitors, but those who do come during the wee hours are strange indeed.<br />One thing leads to another and soon Clay is entangled in the mystery of the shop, specifically the mystery of the \\"Waybacklist\\"--what he calls the books housed on the high shelves in the back of the store--and the people who come to check them out.<br /><br />I found the writing to be delightful: cleverly written by someone who is knowledgeable of computer tech and who also loves books and words. There's so much subtle humor (for some reason, I'm not a big fan of in-your-face humor books), I had a smile on my face almost the entire time I was reading.<br />As a used-to-be programmer, I found this riff on computer languages amusing, especially the part about C, since that's the code I most often used:<br /><br />\\"Normal written languages have different rhythms and idioms, right? Well, so do programming languages. The language called C is all harsh imperatives, almost raw computer-speak. The language called Lisp is like one long, looping sentence, full of subclauses, so long in fact that you usually forget what it was even about in the first place. The language called Erlang is just like sounds: eccentric and Scandinavian. ...<br />But Ruby, my language of choice since NewBagel, was invented by a cheerful Japanese programmer, and it reads like friendly, accessible poetry. Billy Collins by way of Bill Gates.\\"<br /><br />I love it!<br />There are so many clever lines and so many, if not big, then interesting ideas presented in the book. Like what the year 3012 might look like, and how it might develop:<br /><br />\\"`Each big idea like this is an operating system upgrade....Writers are responsible for some of it. They say Shakespeare invented the internal monologue.... But I think writers had their turn...and now it's programmers who get to upgrade the human operating system.'\\"<br /><br />As Clay is pulled deeper into solving the mystery of the Waybacklist, he engages the unique talents of everyone from his new roommate, his longtime high-school buddy, who's on his way to making it big in the tech world, and a new girlfriend who works at Google--affectionately called a \\"googler\\"--to help him in his quest.<br /><br />I read a few reviews of this book before deciding to purchase it, and some reviewers were disappointed in the ending. I wish I hadn't read these reviews because I wonder if I didn't have them in the back of my mind. (Should I be disappointed in this ending?) After a little contemplating, I decided I was perfectly happy with it. Because it was a real-life ending--because, while there were mysteries and puzzles and odd secret societies, there were not any elements of magical realism, so why should the end of the novel be something the rest of the book is not?<br /><br />All I can say is I was eager to keep reading this book--something that happens more rarely than I'd like to admit as of late. And I wasn't disappointed in how it ended, I was just sorry it did.uage of choice since NewBagel, was invented by a cheerful Japanese programmer, and it reads like friendly, accessible poetry.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Enjoyed this game immensely. Would highly recommend to everyone. Do yourself a favor and buy this asap oh yeah it's that good. Get the original quell, too.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Although I am only 50% through the book, I can already say it’s a great book; I have been enjoying it very much. It is encouraging to find that I am not weird, just different from all those extroverts who seem to be everywhere, making so much noise. I am grateful for the insights and practical help which will help me to be surer of whom I am and to turn what has seemed to me up to now as a handicap, into a strength and an advantage.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like hidden object games. This game is entertaining; however it does require you to involve other people which is a bit annoying.  Overall, it's worth it though.
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|While I like the True Blood series, I have never been a fan of Paquin. I thought maybe it was poor writing on the show, but nope this movie proves she can not act.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this for my husband who's in the military. He absolutely loves them....as do I. The case came well packaged and the cd's were in great condition. I recommend these dvd's to everyone!! They are so good I have to make myself stop watching them.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I think this is a really good app is a social network app, so it's good for talking with friends n communicating with family members
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire works great! Just what I wanted. Hints are good for learning to play the game. Nice app for killing time.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wholly immersing, engrossing characters, great contextual cliffhangers ... and plot twists that flow incredibly well with the fantastic tale. What is particularly refreshing is the quality of prose - this guy knows how to write. Editing is superb too, unlike much of the self-published fiction on Kindle which is replete with grammatical errors (which drives me nuts!).<br /><br />One of those books that keeps you thinking for days after you read it - a rare treat.<br /><br />Get this book. You won't be disappointed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app loaded without problems and has functioned well. It is fairly intuitive even for this new Kindle user. Had no trouble getting my local weather and setting up other locales. Ads are blessedly inobtrusive, too.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Lovely story exploring the will to survive and the will to remain spiritual in the face of death. Great story to lift the spirits!
B003L77GG0|5.0|This last season is by far the best. Smallville is my favorite television series of all-time and this final season wrapped everything up perfectly. This is a Must own
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a calc app.<br />This one Works great!<br />I especially like the large buttons. My eyesight can't take the smaller buttons.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read a lot of books. A lot! And this book is the best book I have ever read. I burst into tears when it was over because it was that good. I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat and Hopeless was even better than both of them combined. Colleen is a magnificent writer. I'm truly blown away. I will read it again. And again. And again. LOVED IT!
0783222955|5.0|Most movies don't do justice to their novels.  This one comes close.  The acting is superb.  As an English teacher, I always want you to read the book.  I also recommend watching the movie then discussing both with others.  The amount of conversational topics will astound you.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Could have been much better, it's slow, very slow movie with not much of action or soul in it for Bruce Willis fans.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|no white light only yellow ,orange light works tried different times downloads fast just expected to work like a standard  flash light
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book has a lot of excitement to it and it should be read by the ones who likes action or fighting .
B00632HWOG|5.0|I HAVE USED YAHOO FOR YEARS, AND MAIL WORKS GREAT EASY TO USE WORKS GREAT ON KINDLE CAN CHECK ALL THE TIME
B0053O89WY|5.0|Still love this TV series, even in its fifth iteration. Literally can't get enough. The characters are just as funny, just as charming, and just as quirky as ever. Strap on your geek-helmets because it's going to take you for a seriously fun ride!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|FINALLY FOUND THIS APP, SPEND A LOT OF TIME PLAYING ON KINDLE, WORKS GREAT EASY TO USE AAA ++++ AND FREE
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!! This is a great book. I LOVE Holder. Such a good character. Wish there were more books by this author.
B000053GTF|3.0|Okay for ten videos, then freezes and skips.  Poor product.  Won't be fooled again!  Hook, line, and sinker...thank you very much (not)...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The book is perfect for people who enjoy the question &#34;what if&#34;? A very descriptive and well researched book into the life of a man who is pulled into something extraordinary by the local cafe owner. It starts out a bit slower, not at all boring, but the action doesn't appear for the first few chapters. But once it gets into the time travel, past changing, and love story the reader is incapable of putting the book down. I was a little skeptical about purchasing this book, because I am more into his Horror based novels (and of course the dark tower series) but I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone, not just die hard King fans.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Do not get for kindle fire the search is screwed up<br />(; ;) a b c d e f g
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning to the end.. i couldnt stop reading it. I love Nicholas Sparks book
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|I have found most movies made today to be shallow minded, plotless, morally lacking.  But not this movie. Extremely well done and I can only hope more will be produced like this.<br /><br />Without going into all the details of the plot, it is a thought provoking, twist filled, very well written movie that engages you to the last frame.  If your looking for the usual, predictable explosions, gratuitous sex scenes, look elsewhere.  However, if you are looking for something that keeps you guessing, keeps you watching (even though you have other things that need to get done!), then enjoy!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Yes, I would say out of this triology, the was the best of the three.  Fast moving, although good have used a little less detail of history I felt wasn't needed.  A shame the author is no longer with us.
B001706I5I|3.0|I think they made the Grinch a bit too vulgar (fart jokes and such) and maybe too creepy for some sensitive viewers. Its still a fun holiday movie to wrap presents while its playing in the background.
1451638450|5.0|Ivan acted the way I would have wanted him to,in this new possision that he found himself in. A good book that I will reread.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Seeing honest Abe save the union from vampires seems plausible enough for me to enjoy this action packed romp. They made the vampires look scary enough (no sparkles!) and we get to see that awesome gun axe in action.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This movie was in very good condition. This is a great holiday movie that are adult and teen friendly, however should be warned that it is a little mature and best with adult supervision or review.
0307943232|1.0|I have never before written a review of any product on Amazon, let alone provided a brief review of an audiobook I recently purchased.  Yet, just having finished The Racketeer, I feel compelled to contribute my input.  This rambling, run-on-sentence-of-a -book is perhaps the worst fiction I have read in my life.  Mr. Grisham is a talented writer and is capable of producing some fine fiction but this does not qualify.  If the NYT wrote a positive review, so be it.  My reaction, upon completing the book, was to feel cheated.  Not financially, though that was certainly true.  I felt cheated by the author, who is clearly capable of so much more.  Listen to the afterword and the author's cavalier dismissal of research (and plot, I might add) suggest that he was sitting in a beach chair tapping out sentence after sentence on his iPad with no concern as to the quality of his product.  There is no suspense, no depth to the characters, no color to the details, and no intrigue.  Never again, Mr. Grisham.
0800141431|5.0|For being a video cassette, this came in great condition. Also, this came very quickly. I am excited to watch this all the time. Great movie, everyone should watch it once

B005KELQEU|5.0|This sleeve case does exactly what it advertised. It protects my Kindle Paperwhite and it's a lot cheaper than other Kindle protectors.
B004RL9T50|4.0|Nice children's movie that can also be entertaining to adults, especially if you are young at heart. I would watch it again.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Really good, after a certain point things got somewhat redundant other then that I loved the trilogy it was great and loved the characters!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Really liked the story line and supporting cast, I am really big on Baseball movies and this is one of the better ones
0765325950|5.0|How dare you guys rate down the CONTENT of an AMAZING BOOK because you don't get your instant satisfaction now, how you want it. Pathetic and selfish. Give the book its due. #disgusted

1574214276|5.0|I bought this book before any of the others, mainly because the page count was highest. I wasn't disappointed! There are about 100 different tangles covered here, most of which I haven't seen elsewhere. I'm very happy with this book and will look forward to future publications by Ms. McNeill.
1451629184|5.0|I would reccomend this book to anyone who is in law enforcement and wants an insight into the lives of the people who are taken and the ones that it affects. This book is very detailed and not for someone with a weak stomach.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Multiple level of games for me and my grandchildren.  Great fun and easy time spent together.Would highly recommend for all.
B0015DROBO|3.0|starts very slowly with little excitement or action .  Last 3-4 chapters are good. Not sure if I will purchase any more of Trilogy
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was one of the most interestingly entertaining books I have read.  Having the main character continually work at problem solving through out his very difficult circumstances made for<br />an excitingly fun book to read and one I hated to have end.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Great new perspective coming from the dogs point of view.  Makes you stop and think about life and were you are going.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I've read this story in hard cover a couple of times, so when I got my Kindle and saw that there was a free version for download, I downloaded it.  I downloaded it so that my daughter could read it.  My family has the DVD set of Pride and Prejudice Istarring Colin Firth) and they love it, so I wanted my daughter to enjoy the written version.  She did!  As I said, this is a classic tale for all ages and I highly recommend it.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Great album!!!  After watching Idol I knew it would be.  Arrived early.  Listened to it 3 times in a row.

B007RE0SCW|5.0|I purchased this doll as a gift for my niece. She absolutley loved it! She started screaming when she opened it and hasn't stopped playing with it yet.
B005UPOAT2|5.0|I love this movie! Watched it many, many times and enjoyed it every time. Even bought another one to send to my daughter as part of a group of several chick flicks.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great story.  Author's writing is sharp as a razor and witty.  Such an exciting page-turner.  I Highly recommend this book.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was a gift for Christmas, grandson seemed to love it, I was amazed at how small the set was, but apparently he knew it was going to be.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This is one of the most original stories I've seen. Great acting all around, especially a six year old new actor. He was so good that I seriously wondered whether he was C.G. at one point. The best science fiction of 2012.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|While my husband was in the hospital I needed something to do and had no problem downloading this movie plus it is a funny movie and help with the blahhness of being in the hospital.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Does not seem to work really well on my Kindle Fire. I have tried using it a number of times, and then just deleted it.
B009VB97EY|5.0|this was a great idea for a fun girls night with some wine. Make sure the young ones are down for the night so you can enjoy the movie.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|Being at a loss for something to read, I ran across this story and found a very good read. I liked the story overall, though some of the story was a bit of a stretch and drawn out. I look forward to giving her next book a try.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a great purchase.  I got it as Daily Deal and I'm in love. I've wanted to have the entire series since the first movie came out and now I own all of them.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Action packed! It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Clare Danes is great!  I would definitely recommend it!

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book and series is awesome if you are a Harry Potter fan you will love them and all of the other books that Rick Riordan has written.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Beautiful! It was wondrous! The ways each of the demigods creatively killed their enemies is the reason I love Ricks books.  All of the jokes made me laugh so hardly sister told me to be quite and stop trying to get attention. But I don't care. The jokes were better, the monsters scarier, and the conflict of the couple's were better. Wow! RICK ROCKS!!!!
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Leon: The Professional really needs no review. Just watch it. It sells itself.<br /><br />This review is more about Amazon's customer service. It's phenominal. Imagine my excitement to pop this bad boy open and sit down to enjoy Gary Oldman at his finest. Imagine my supreme disappointment when the disc was completely missing! I have ordered literally dozens of movies from Amazon and this has never happened before. I immediately went online to see how to resolve the problem. The return program is simple and geared toward total customer satisfaction. Amazon is one company that is definitely doing things right. Before the end of the night a brand new copy of Leon was on its way to my doorstep. This one with a disc snuggly resting inside. I'm not sure why my original copy didn't have the disc, but honestly, it doesn't matter. What matters is that Amazon handled the matter quickly, fairly and in such as way that has left me totally satisfied with my experience.<br /><br />You keep on being you, Amazon! I'll be a lifelong customer at the rate you're going.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Great sequel to the series. Didn't think they could do it again. Good message and really funny too! Super movie!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game.  I come back to it continually when I need a break from boredom or just to pass time.  I like playing solitaire anytime.  I'm not a card player but love this game.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was entertained through the whole trilogy. It's a very good story. Especially with the way it ended. It's definitely worth reading.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This book can't be beat in any format. The language and energy of the story surpass all other considerations. Bravo!

B009KS4XRO|3.0|i do not play this on my kindle as all of my rooms dont show up which are the levels i am at on bingo blitz. if all of my rooms were available then i would like the game!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was finally able to get my hands on this book after hearing about  it for some time and devoured it over the past week end..I am not surprised  that chivalrous  behaviour existed among members of the Air Forces in the air war over Europe.I found the account of the encounter both thrilling and informative, I was particularly  happy that the two combatants were finally able to &#34;put  the pieces in place&#34; and become close friends in their final years.It took a courageous German to defy the murderous criminal atmosphere  which existed in Nazi Germany. It also took a brave soul to fly over Germany night after night,knowing the sky was full of flack and night fighters who were equally determined to make sure you didn't get home
B00AVPYT8I|1.0|App starts out fine. You can access the books fine until you scroll down past the bottom of first page. Then it ceases to function, every time you try to pick a book past that point it reverts to the book that was in that position on the first page. Does same thing in genre.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Arrived early.  Great movie.  My favorite movie and now my sons favorite movie.  I am so happy to finally have it on blueray
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loved it!  The case holds all of the CD's well.  The season itself was very good for a starting show.  After the first six or so episodes the feel of the episodes start becoming like they are now currently.  It was shipped in a timely manner and in good packaging as well!
B00006RJ59|3.0|The case was badly damaged but most importantly the DVD was in good shape didnt have any scratches on it.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|One of the best pictures I have seen in awhile. Good actors and good acting. Take the time to see it.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|We can't wait for the sequel to this one!  Thanks for delivering it so quickly, and selling it at such a fair price.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I didn't expect this little sharpener to work as well as it does.  Well worth the money, buy it you won't be sorry.
0451213092|5.0|This book is so timely. I read it many years ago, and my husband became interested after seeing a program about the hostage<br />situation in Iran documentary. I remembered this book, and he is so happy that I ordered it for him You will find that you cannot<br />put this book down once you start reading it. I have reread it and enjoyed it again
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love the character of Agent Pendergast.  This book continues to expand and extend his story and opens new doors for the future.  The writing is excellent and I am already anxious for the next, since I read this one in about 4 days.  You won't be disappointed!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|have had a lot of fun with this game. Loaded easyUse up the battery quick but is a lot of fun
B004JXXKWY|5.0|Compulsory reading for anyone who wants to truly understand the GFC.  Even if you don't get all the technical stuff, a rollicking good read!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|This would not load. Am still having problems getting on my tablet. Will stay away from this companies programs. Rally was looking foward to using it.
B002DPRLEI|5.0|have been looking for these old movies! I remember watching them when I was little late at night. I brings back memories. The service was fast and I loved getting this in the mail.
B008XG1X18|1.0|Unable to put on tablet. Would love to have on there as an app. but went to web page & booked marked it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is probably my favorite book of all time. I laughed and I cried. The best $4 I've ever spent on a book by far. I read it all in one day and was very satisfied with the ending.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|It is a great tale of how Greg survives trapped in his home with a low amount of food. I love this book.
B005VPRET4|5.0|Cool gift - Scenery & products are quite realistic<br />Note from our daughter: The cupcakes were challenging because the circles don't stay well in the cupcake wrapper.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I had heard so many good things about \\"Gone Girl\\" that I wanted to read others before that one. I was not disappointed! I thought this book was fabulously written. I was able to easily follow all the different storylines of all the characters and that's not always easy to do. I'm looking very forward to now reading \\"Gone Girl\\" and others by Gillian Flynn.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Great game, fun for all ages, who doesn't like stick figures you get to draw, name, and play in a game drawing all sorts of things to help you.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I chose this rating because I liked the book. I think it's a really good resource for kids in high school with English classes that have work to do with vocabulary and root words. So, I would recommend this book to those kids.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I wish we could give half stars because this actually would have gotten 2.5 stars in my mind. I enjoyed the plot but this movie was better suited to a science fiction channel release, sans Willis. Bruce Willis was a supporting actor in this movie who did a mediocre job. The best acting came from the mother of the child on the farm, she consumed her role and made the latter part of the movie better in my eyes.<br />Ok, to the nitty gritty. I follow plot lines very well and of course we suspend belief in reality for a movie such as this. But, there are 2 failed plot issues in the story line. The first might be classified as a double flashback in the style of Momento. However the first flashback/time travel sequence in question is self annihilating and makes no logical sense as a viewer. We can make assumptions but in reality the sequence were the young looper meets Bruce Willis his old self takes a viewer on a time loop that actually has no closure. The first loop the younger Willis dies which would close all future possibility,  then they throw a couple flashback time travel loops that somehow replay this moment and redo the loop. Unfortunately this section allows no actual closure in the time loop.<br />The final climactic scene in the movie has the younger looper do something when all he had to do is resolve to himself in the present not to do it, simple as that. The writers of the movie try to explain this away through botched dialogue where Willis talks about possible realities and probabilities. This was failed because anything that happened to young loopers in the present automatically happened  to their older selves.<br />Neat concept, bad writing and execution for people who follow timelines and plots. Stop here if you havent seen the movie, the main story isn't spoiled but a major gripe I have is shared.<br />One little spoiler that actually made me think really?... they tell us this whole time how looping and time travel works and then suspend it for the leading up to the climax. The whole presupposition of Bruce Willis coming back is that the girl who got him off drugs was killed, for this he wants to kill the main evil character as a child. His younger self is weened off drugs by another women. Regardless of how which way the plot line runs the writers really needed to make this work.<br />Two and a half stars for concept and genre, but a look at the plot and the majority of the acting is why this movie was almost straight to DVD.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and I highly recommend others to read it. Nicholas sparks has done it again, I couldn't imagine a better ending!!!
B003L77FYS|5.0|When you buy something over the internet, you always take a risk no matter how well the company is rated. The best you can hope for is that the product is right. In my case, the product was right but would not work properly. With dread, I sent an email with very little expectation. What I received however was the best customer service. This company went out of their way to make it right. This is a good company and I would trust them again.
B007SNMYNS|4.0|Overall, this is worth a read. It does get a bit repetitive in places, but there's still lots of interesting content.
1400049628|5.0|Loved the ideas for surviving a ZOMBIE event! This is a great read<br />for anyone who is into the &#34;walking dead&#34; faze.
B009HELT3C|3.0|the movie was just ok.  I think it is time to end the MIB series.  Rented this movie, would not buy it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The  hunger  games was a great book. I just love the story. Some parts in the book make me cry. Great book please read.
0802473156|5.0|Would definitely encourage any couple considering marriage to get this book. Has been great for me. This is on my list of books I give for pre-marital counseling.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Good app for checking in on Ebay purchaces at a glance. Keeps from having to scroll through multiple screens in Kindle browser.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book gets you reading and continuing to read because it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I could not put it down until I was done reading.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Couldn't have enjoyed this season more. Fascinating characters with intriguing flaws. Disciplined story telling, a plot full of intrigue and motivations that made sense.
B004LROUW2|3.0|Wow.... 900 pages.  Glad I got the kindle version.  Anyway, the first part of the book was good.  It was all so interesting because we didn't have any idea what was going on.  The middle added a lot of action but not a whole lot of explanation.  The ending left me full of questions and rather empty.  I felt like the entire novel was building up to a climactic ending, but in the end it just did not culminate.  At all.  The last couple hundred of pages were incredibly disappointing.  I didn't understand the importance of anything that had happened in the lengthy book.  And that's not on me - I love poetry.  Trust me, I have no problem getting the meaning from a piece of fiction.  This piece just did not have much meaning, if any at all.<br /><br />The whole thing took me about a month to read.  The first 300 pages or so only a few days, but after that I had to make myself go on because of the commitment i had already made.  It felt like a waste of my time.  Gave it three stars because the writing style itself, ignoring the actual content, was a welcome breath of fresh air from the fiction I usually read (contemporary/classic english literature).  900 pages was a bit much of it though...
B009H442DG|5.0|A great compilation of songs and is well done...Love it  I have nothing bad to say about it and would order it again or recommmend it to anyone..
160459201X|5.0|this is a great book it was a great price it shipped very quickly and it was just as expected
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|This is a pretty fun game.  Playing the AI is a fun experience and can get pretty difficult.  Playing against another human player is a bit difficult on a smaller device, or a device that tends to slide around.  Overall, a fun little game to have when you need to kill some time.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a really good movie. I have loaned it to family members to watch and they all like it as well. I would recommend this to buy.

B009VB97EY|3.0|Eh, okay movie was hoping for more of Matthew - Would still recommend to ALL!  Thanks Amazon for a great site and the total ease of purchasing videos.  I have to admit though that EVERY time we pause a movie it gets locked up and there is a major delay.  Please fix this issue.  Thanks much!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|The Google Play store doesn't offer an ad free or premium version of Angry Birds.  This is the version to purchase to be add free. Graphics and sound are great.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!  Would recommend to ALL!  Thanks Amazon for a great site and the total ease of purchasing videos.  I have to admit though that EVERY time we pause a movie it gets locked up and there is a major delay.  Please fix this issue.  Thanks much!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was hard to finish, a bit heartbreaking.  Katniss lost so much. I guess heroes always do.  \\"Mockingjay\\" didn't end like a typical fairytale.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|Buying this is a no brainer.  I was just reaching concert going age when John Bonham died.  I saw Plant on his first solo tour and also was at Live Aid in Phili in 1985 when they reunited for 3 songs with Phil Collins and Tony Thompson on drums.  I've always wanted and hoped for a full reunion tour of these guys with Jason on drums but have to respect them for not doing it just for the payday.  I believe it is Plant who is the holdout and can't blame him, he wants to move forward.<br /><br />With that said, I was so psyched when the release of this 2007 concert was announced and I put it as a no brainer on my Christmas list - my kids got it for me.  Yea!<br /><br />I've listened to the CD's a lot more than the video, only watched that once.  It is really a great set to buy with just a few minor complaints from my perspective. Most of the reviews are gushing with praise.  I still give this four stars so take these for what it is worth:<br /><br />- I respect the setlist they put together, but as a fan I would have tossed out a few of their choices for some more uptempo songs.  Those are the songs taht really make this collection worth it.<br />- I would have dropped these songs: For your life-with a collection like LZ's do you really need an obscure song here?  Since I've Been Loving you just drags, as does the first half of Dazed and Confused.<br />- Where they really rock is on songs like Kashmir, Black Dog, Whole Lotta Love, etc.  The uptempo songs!  If they wanted some mellow songs how about someting like Going to CA?<br />- My one complaint about the DVD is the audio and video on my setup seemed to get out of sync.  Only time this has happened on my system so I have to feel like it is the DVD and not my system.  I even have an audio delay feature where I can get them to sync back up.  But then it goes to the next song and it is out of sync again.  This is part of the reason I only watched it once so far. Frustrating for them to be out of sync on some of the songs, couldn't they have edited this better?  I haven't seen this in other reviews so maybe it is just me??<br /><br />Otherwise, this is great, Jason really kicks it on the drums.  The audio mix is really good, the drums sound great, almost too great as they standout.  John Paul Jones is really a great musician and Plant is such a great front man.  Nothing more can be said about Page, he's like a character out of Lord of the Rings here, he looks so much like a master.<br /><br />Despite my minor complaints, this is very  much a recommended purchase.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose to read part two of the hunger games because i absolutely loved the first one. In this book youll be trapt to the very end not expecting what would happened next. I recomended to everyone who has read the Hunger Games cause if you liked it you will certainly love part 2. Im ready for tve third
030759565X|5.0|As a follower of Ms. Perelman's blog, I was very excited to find out she was publishing a cookbook.  Her recipes always have that extra something, that makes you just want to stop what you're doing and start cooking.  Lavishly illustrated (and mouthwateringly, too!) there are recipes for all seasons/reasons.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It is amazing what he  finds in a women he has only known for a night, before marrying her. Then when he loses her, he realizes what he has lost and makes it a goal to get it back and he achieves it. I love the romantic twist to this book.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|I love this movie. Nothing more needed to be said about it. It is funny and should be a Christmas staple.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game. if you like temple run you'll love this. it gets harder and harder the more your score gets higher.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is the best one out there - no skipping- great sound choices- puts me to sleep and keeps me asleep!!!
0061692042|2.0|While well written in places, this one really plods and is repetitive to the extreme. Since I am a big fan of coming of age stories, I was sorely disappointed. Really hard for me to see what all the critics were so excited about. Actually worth 2.5 stars. Would have made a good short story if the excess were trimmed!
B0061QD88S|5.0|We don't have a Blu-Ray player so we didn't need the &#34;special edition&#34; that was available in stores.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Wonderful movie and it looks just lovely.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I throughly enjoyed the movie.  This was a great bargain at only $5.  While not the entire soundtrack of the movie, almost all the major songs are in the highlights.  I have the soundtrack of the Broadway production and saw a production of Les Mis in San Francisco, and this \\"Highlight\\" disc is just as enjoyable as the full soundtrack of the Broadway production.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I related so heavily with this book. In fact, I think that I even fell in love with the main character, Charlie, in the process. Chboskys unique \\"letter\\" style really made this book alluring. Because you get so caught up in the story sometimes, that you have to just stop and remember that these are intimate letters, and there's just something so beautiful about that.<br />There's not much to say, except that it's something that I think a lot of teenagers who struggle through their youth will be able to identify with.
B009WJ14FA|5.0|California electric blues. One of the best new artists on the scene in some time. Heard them play on one of the late night talk shows and had to buy this.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|From start to finish, Stephen King has painted one of the richest stories in any novel for quite some time. Don't expect it to be horror, but do expect his literary prowess to be on full display here. The journey is absolutely worth it, but that ending...prepare yourself for some heartbreak.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Castle is a great show because it use witty dialog to convey the story line. Very entertaining! I love watching it.

B0037B6QSY|5.0|A great book to learn the importance of experiencing every moment you are alive to the fullest. I have bought this book numerous times and always ended up giving it away to a friend in need.

B007R11DKQ|1.0|Great actors, not a bad story...but very poorly written, very disappointing. All the women were angry and snarky. Too many immature references about breasts...and a cross dresser pirate, really? It could've been so much more. Even with the beautiful scenery, costumes, good acting and creative flying ship I still give it two thumbs down.

B003NFM3JU|4.0|The 3D effects are fantastic, this movie is very well done.  The only thing missing is the reason for Christmas - Christ himself.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|My kids wanted to watch this show and with nothing else going on, I succumbed.  I didn't have high expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  My kids enjoyed this movie and so did I.  It made me hope for more of the story someday.
0307951529|1.0|Not a bad basic business book, some thoughtful bits<br />BUT very short on specifics and effectively nothing on any $100 start-ups<br />(getting a $43 dollar business license doesn't make a business, what about stock, a place to sell, etc, etc.)<br />think i'd enjoy a meal with the author, but the title is WAAY misleading and in fact a promotional lie<br />-- with a different title, would come a different expectation (and then higher rating)
B004GJYR7I|5.0|One of the funniest movies ever. I would recommend this movie to everybody. We don't get comedies like this any more.
B005R5U5B2|5.0|I succumbed to the purchase of this CD after much heart-felt pleading from my ten year old daughter, who faithfully promised that she would pay me back out of her pocket money; anything, anything to have this album. Meanwhile my heart was sinking with the vision of future car journeys accompanied by another run-of-the-mill boy-band producing frothy anodyne pop; musical wallpaper which would quickly drive us mad.<br /><br />We got in the car. The CD was excitedly anticipated by some, dreaded by others. Oh yes, I sort of recognise the first track, must have heard it before, it's ok actually...Hmm, the second track begins in quite an interesting way...<br /><br />And so on. The 4th track's my favourite and I look forward to it every time, but then I like track 3 too. And 7, and of course track 1 is great.<br /><br />I feel I know the boys now and I like them. I even know their names. I've started reading news articles about them.<br /><br />My elder daughter has gone from deriding her sister's favourite as \\"rubbish\\" to downloading the album onto her phone so she can listen more often.<br /><br />In short it's a hit, an unexpected and wonderful hit with all the family. It's feel-good music, full of hooks and with shifts of harmony which engage even the most resistant of listeners. The lyrics are teenage, yes, but heck we were all teenagers once.<br /><br />And secretly I now look forward to car journeys. Though I can't let on.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|cute game!  still has a few glitches though.. but over all a game that will keep your attention for hours.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Exciting, suspenseful and a good lesson about what damage too much government can do. No profanity is always a treat too.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I think a movie is supposed to take you away from your own life and give you something to think about.  This did both for me. I'm getting older and it showed me what I've been dealing with in my life. This movie also took me away from my troubles and let me have a fairly happy ending.  After all we all need hope!  I think this movie gives you hope.

B009NPA3Q4|4.0|He's hot.  He's an amazing singer.  I would love to listen to his voice to sing to me every day in my bedroom.
B004G600A4|5.0|I've seen this movie numerous times and loved it each time. I bought it for a movie night at an RMH where the kids and adults alike thoroughly enjoyed it. Funny, cute, Disney.<br />The DVD behaved well, too. No skipping, no blurring.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|It was a fun movie just like the others, though starting to get too many main characters. Glad to see more use of the squirrel.
6305229449|3.0|The movie was listed as new but I am honestly not sure if it was or not. It was very evident it was not in manufacturers packaging at least, it had probably a good 6 in. of extra plastic wrapping hanging off of a very loosely wrapped movie box. My daughter is happy and it plays fine so that is why I gave it 3 stars instead my initial thought.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I love this book. At times I cryed a little. And at times I cryed a lot. Jaycee is very strong. I am so happy she decided to share her story with every one. Because for one, she was able to let it all out and by doing that it helped her move on a little bit sooner. For two, it told every one the truth. and instead of letting people say things that weren`t true.  I highly recommend this book for anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|You cannot put this game down. Love it! Trying to knock the towers over is so amazing. The kids be begging to play.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent!!!  Watched one episode and instantly addicted!  The online stream is great quality with absolutely no hiccups.  Can't wait to finish the season.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|great movie, great characters, love that we see a different side of anna kendrick! also great to see brittany snow in something fun!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What a great series- thought-provoking! Good, easy read. Found myself reading instead of sleeping several nights to find out what was going to happen. Fell in love with the characters and their story. Bet you will too. Do yourself a favor, read the books before you see the movie.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Khaled Hosseini gives us an insider look at the impossible life of women in Afghanistan and shows how lives can twist and turn and become something very different than we might expect. An entrancing read - well worth recommending!
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Some of my favorite movies of all time, helloooooo Harrison Ford at his best! Witty, adventurous, romantic, funny, thought-provoking.... Good price too. My only complaint and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars, I ordered back in March, didn't come until SEPTEMBER! Wish I would have known it would take so long to arrive.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I like Mitch Albom's writing and have read his other books. This one is more of a fable than his others. It is quickly read. As usual, food for thought about how we live our lives - in the present, past or future.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|While I find Will Ferrell over-the-top and slightly annoying in several of his other movies, in Elf he is spot-on as Buddy, the loveable goofy wannabe. This is now a mandatory Christmas family viewing at my house, as well as a quotable laughfest whenever we pull it out of the box. Suitable for all ages. Worth the $!
B009MO57H6|1.0|Im so glad i rented this movie because it really does suck. The last one was bad but this one is a thousand times worse.
1609611543|5.0|I saw Dr. William Davis on the Dr. Oz show and was interested in finding out why he called wheat &#34; Frankenfood&#34;.  I read the book and found it so informative.  We are not eating what we think we are eating.  The wheat our grand parents and great grand parents ate had 22 chromozones; the wheat we are eating today has 44 chromozones because it has been genetically modified and not for our good.  It's all about big business and making money.<br /><br />The wheat is a poison to our body and causes many diseases and lots of weight gain.  I stopped eating wheat and all gluten foods and the gas, bloating, IBS, etc. ceased.  Dr. Davis, MD is a Cardiologist and has helped thousands of patients heal from heart disease, auto immune diseases and numerous other problems.<br /><br />I thought going gluten-free would be very difficult, but found that there are many gluten-free products in almost any store . . .  I recommend this book to all who are seeking truth, health, happinest and a better life for us, our children and grand children.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jet pack joy ride is my favorite game when I need something to do for a few minutes or I am just bored!
B000002KGT|5.0|Oldie but Goodie - have tickets for this year's tour - refreshing memories and diggin' out the jukj box vinyl
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Thus game has been lots of fun. I recommend it to any one. Young or old you will enjoy it.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I am a huge Robert Pattinson fan! The movie was fairly priced and was an awesome watch. I highly recommend buying this movie
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I have read over 250 books since I acquired my first Kindle.  This is the first book I have gone out of my way to recommend.<br />-Friend:  \\"Hey Bill, what's new?\\"<br />-Me:  \\"Dude!  You have totally got to read this book.  Here, take one of my spare Kindles.  Give it 2 chapters.\\"<br />-2 days later, Friend:  \\"I call it my lucky rope.\\"  Hilarity ensues and those co-workers who haven't read the book eye us suspiciously.  Those who have read it join us in laughter.<br /><br />Why is it so much fun?  Why do I think it is a great book?  There is a basic recipe in this book: a) state the situation, b) list possible solutions, c) list how each solution can go terribly wrong and end in death, d) state the solution and detail the method used, and e) list the unexpected and life-threatening consequences from the so-called solution.  Repeat.  Add liberal amounts sarcasm and engineering humor with a high degree technically accuracy. Result: Awesome and entertaining story.<br /><br />While we were together as a family during Christmas, I got my Dad and both of my boys to read the book.  Rolling their eyes, they agreed to try it.  10 minutes later, laughter was heard throughout the house.<br /><br />I especially recommended this book for anyone with a technical background.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I loved it so much then I had to have a copy in my collection.  Mark Twain is one of America's best writers.  Not only is this an excellent story, it will teach you about the life and times of a young boy on the Mississippi in the 1800's.  Adults and children will love these storiues.  JCG
B008476HBM|5.0|This is my favourite book of all time. It is truly a timeless classic. I recommend it to anyone who is old enough to comprehend what the book is about.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|You cant beat Rudyard Kipling.  And this is one of his best.  Kids and adulkts will love these stories.  JCG
B008D1LVRY|5.0|I liked the diversity of the first two albums. This album gets back to the power groove metal that has been a big part of the roots of each of the members former bands. This is some good old melt your face metal, go see them live, they don't disappoint!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Started it three day ago, and I didn't have  work I would have finished it in a day...this is a true page turner and a legal thriller in true meaning of the words.....
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Came within the time it said it would, and it's just really great. I watch it allll the time :)
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|not very good instructions to play on the kindle. Would think twice before purchasing additional games Others have had the same problem
B005LAIIHG|5.0|ang lee, director is a genius. life of pi is the best movie i have seen this year. must be seen in 3d. it is so much more than the<br />story of a boy with a tiger in a boat. i cried, i laughed, and i left very moved.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Explain this experience is difficult but you can enjoy this band as legendary as is Led Zeppelin live is absolutely brutal and presented beautifully and remember all these issues that were once a part of our life
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was unexpected. I thought that this was going to be just another fluff movie but it actually had heart. Two thumbs up!
B0074JODP8|5.0|Como siempre este sr no defrauda y acompañado con estos musicos increibles como Beth Hard,el Sr Paul Rogers hacen de este dvd brutal.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Looper was a big surprise. I usually don't like these kind of movies but when you watch this you go on a thrill ride of emotion! It was amazing!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|One of the best concerts I've enjoyed leaves one speechless accompanied by his position and his great band the best of the world ecenarios surrendering to the amazing Joe chords.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|very cute! My daughter got a lot of laughs playing this app.  I would recomend it, but keep the volume down
B003XMKMTQ|5.0|An amazing concert bringing together this incredible musicians that make guitars tremble and this DVD is highly recommended for fans of the Blues.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A fun alternative to the real version at the arcade.  My son is 9 and enjoyed playing this.  Frustration gets started when coins are exhausted and you have to wait for more coins to continue play.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The first movie was great and well thought out.<br />This was a series of unrealistic storylines that made no sense to me.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|If you can't make it right, don't do it !!<br />Will Smith has no energy, T.L. Jones's face looks like a rubber mask. Only Josh Brolin shines.<br />Aliens looks so fake and I know they tried to make them look like monsters in 1960's sci-fi movies.<br />But totally backfired in this age of super advanced CG era.. just look ridiculous.<br />Story is boring. Don't bother to watch it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fans who like suspence would enjoy this author. All of his book will keep you wanting to read more.  Very good author.
B004LX0DHC|5.0|I think the idea in this book is very powerful, it is something worth reading and I definitely will be trying it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love the 'Story' games but I like this ALOT more than DragonStory.  Easier to play and make money, pass levels and even load.  I wasn't sure if I would like this game, but I'm really enjoying it!
B0055Q5F36|5.0|otterbox makes the best cases for phones ever.  no more cracked screens because this think is freaking invincible. love it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed book...kept my interest...great sex and an attentive and passionate companion can always make other things seem trivial...looking forward to reading more from author
B003VANOFY|4.0|Great sound. the 7.1 really adds to gameplay experience. the bass is extraordinary.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this headset is the software is CRAP. terrible difficult to make work the way it was intended. even for a computer savvy person like myself.
B009AVCAJ4|2.0|The transition to blu ray for this version of Ninja Scroll is very poor. It is not 16x9 and not in 1080p. The audio quality is also poor on this version of Ninja Scroll. I played my DVD version and the quality is better than this version. I would avoid purchasing this until a better version comes out.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|TI best ablum. He has creativity and a strong present with words to make listeners know he is back. Despite everything that happen to him, TI  makes good music. This album makes you GO GET IT. Haha!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoy these types of games! I love the challenges of some of the puzzles within the game. Be warned; after going so far in the game, you will have to purchase in order to continue.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Although it was an excellent movie, right up there with the other Bourne movies, it took a while to get used to not seeing Matt Damian. Hopefully there will be other Bourne movies, they keep you on the edge of your seat, the action is second to none, it's a movie I would highly recommend and will watch again!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book drags a bit compared to the other two .  The characters spent too much time sloshing around the Capitol.
B004UJAOLM|1.0|I disliked this book thoroughly--it was completely different from what I thought it would be.  I couldn't even find a character that LIVED that I liked and was rooting for.  By the end, I really disliked them all.  If you are looking for a nice romantic read like Jane Eyre or Emma or Persuasion then DON'T read this book.  I am sure it is classical literature and makes a nice commentary on society, but as I was not reading this for an English class, I wouldn't know about any of that.  I was not analyzing it, I wanted to read it for fun but didn't enjoy it at all.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Needed this for my Kindle Fire HD. I didn't know that you couldn't install APK files without having a file browsing app on your Kindle. This is a helpful tip for anyone looking to install outside market places. Easy to use app, simple, clean, and works great.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I just finished, certain that the next Pendergast novel will be awesome. No pressure, guys! But please hurry this time; don't let the publisher hold back the next release date.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|How do you review a masterpiece? The story is so beautifully written and so heart<br />wrenching you can't put it down. Why can a man be persecuted for so long for escaping<br />jail for stealing a loaf of bread for his starving family? This is a very good story but so<br />sad. It really is worth reading.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a really fun game.  it was recommended by a friend. I would definitely recommend this game to a friend.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|The story dragged and did not hold my attention. it started off with promise but got bogged down.  I understand it is about the relationships of the people and how they changed and little they really knew each other but that was not a strong enough storyline to be satisfying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The whole family has been playing this game. Get it. It is funny. You have to move and jump fast. Good to kill some free time without thinking too much.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I became aware of Orson Scott Card by reading his articles and opinion pieces in a locally published newspaper.  As time went on, we had kids at the same schools and he was frequently asked to talk about the life of an author to our school children or other civic groups.  Middle Schools assigned Ender or Bean stories to classes.  I have worn the cover off my paperback copies, read by two students and repeatedly by me on long trips in the family van.  He describes houses, ponds, trees, bugs, smells... of the area I have lived for 50 years.  Add in waiting in carpool lines behind his large sedan with the obvious license tag...and you know you can ask for an autograph or tell him how much you liked his latest release.  My husband likes to crank him up on the most recent stupidity from the school board or the city counsil.  He is a deep thinker, and that is reflected in all of his books.  I am a fan for life.  I support our local artists, and he is one that makes it easy to do.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Great, easy to use app.  I use it all the time, as do my kids while researching for homework. Highly recommend it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|A great little knife sharpener.  We have one in our house and one in our motorhome.  They make great gifts as well.  One of those things you didn't know you needed until you get one and love it!
B009PAETCG|3.0|It didn't work on my tablet very well.  Probably a result of the tablet, but I cannot give it a real test.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i can play this game by myself or with my kids on car trips..  the whole family enjoys it.  easy to share and play.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Just started watching and we're hooked! The problem is...it keeps getting better, and at some point in the night we have to cut ourselves off and head to bed.<br /><br />Hope this show has a long run!
0765325950|5.0|I love to download books as much as the next person, but to deliberately tank the ratings of this book because it is not yet available on kindle is a misuse of your power as a reviewer. We have all waited years and years for this conclusion. If your bookshelf is too full for the hardcopy, it won't kill you to wait a few more months.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I laughed and cried throughout the entire story. Great book, quick read. I definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone
B001AGXEAG|5.0|i love this movie th a n x i  w i ll  s  h op  a ga in g r e a t
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is a great little app for checking your battery strength.  The Kindle Fire HD doesn't have anything to show you the battery strength and this fills the bill.<br />Dwain R.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|The author was very honest about the way she raised her children and the consequences of her actions. There were times when I thought she was way too hard on them but honestly this was a great read for me. With with two young children I think this book drove home the point that it's important to be involved in the lives of your children. Work ethic and perseverance are important for every child and are honestly sadly missing in so many people.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Movie looks great in 3D<br />Delivery was on time<br />I read all the books and the movie didn't do them justice - it was still entertaining.
B0007KS7D0|4.0|+++<br />Optical quality is very good.<br />Mounting is quite easy with the clip-mount system.<br />Price is decent for the optical quality.<br /><br />- - -<br />Depending on the focal length of the lens, vignetting can occur. Be prepared to zoom sufficiently, or to use a long enough focal length to get away from that.<br />The plastic box in which it is packed is way too big for throwing into a bag with limited room. It takes up too much volume for what it contains. A small fabric pouch to protect the glass/mount would be helpful.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Delivered on-time.  My daughter has been listening to this since she first opened it.  Good for young girls.  Safe lyrics for her too.
B0011MZOEI|4.0|Nice combination of action and humor. With Willis and Olyphant in the movie you can't go wrong. Both actors are dynamic.
B001IAME78|5.0|I loved the Hulk used to watch the whole series when I was a kid.  I like watching when I want to watch the avenger.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|If you cannot open pdf files on your device this is a must! However it is nothing special above the regular pdf reading apps that come standard on my kindle fire. I also couldn't edit pdf files from it which is what I was after.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I loved this movie.  I didn't get a chance to watch it at the movie.  I first saw it in Chicago on a vacation in my hotel room.  Loved it so much had to buy it.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game doesn't take much though but does require quick fingers. I know some who love it but its not the greatest game ive ever played. Try it out and see if you have the speed. Or don't. How fast can you run? :)
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. I caught myself laughing out loud on several occasions. The characters are witty and likeable. I highly recommend this one!
B002ZG994U|5.0|I began watching the series in 1983 with the original cast - George Peppard, Mr. T, Dirk Benedict and Dwight Schultz.  And of course directed by Steven J Cannell.  And enjoyed every minute of the show with all the crashes, explosions and crazy things each character would do to complete &#34;the job&#34;.  When I heard that a new A-Team was coming out, I couldnt wait to see it!  Of course, Liam Neeson as Hannibal Smith and Bradley Cooper as Face and then Quinton &#34;Rampage&#34; Jackson - MMA fighter - as B.A. Barracus and finally Sharlto Copley as Murdock made the movie just as good as the series.  Lots of explosions, fighting, humor, etc really makes this movie one to buy for the video library.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Unless I'm missing something. this camera is unlike any camera I've ever used.  Without a view finder or lens on the other side, the only way to take a photo is of something behind me.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|One of my most favorite comic book characters to be brought to the silver screen for all to enjoy is really a treat.  Starting with Christian Bale - plays a great Bruce Wayne.  During the series, it was a joy to see from director Christopher Nolan how dark Batman is.  The previous Batman movies were all, dare I say, &#34;Hollywood&#34;?  I mean, George Clooney, Uma Thurman, Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Arnold, Michael Keeton, Danny DeVito - all wonderful actors, to protray Batman or his villians was just over the top.  Batman is a very dark soul with having lost his parents so violently and then having to take on all villians to keep Gotham safe is very trying for him.  And then to lose his love interest?  Come on!  Though, I will say that Michael Caine as Alfred was a terrific addition.  So overall, this final movie by Nolan - The Dark Night Rises - was awesome!  It really showed how a superhero is so vulnerable and surprisingly fragile against Bane.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great romantic book and so easy to breeze through in just as couple of days. I loved the characters and their strong personalities.
B00003CXA2|5.0|One of Tom Hanks best movies overall!  I am so glad that I was able to find the Two Disc Special Collectors Edition to add to my movie library.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|21st Century philosophical  insight in living.  Fun and laid-back.  The puzzle of the story reads exactly like the writing, layered but easy to see.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Paul Giamatti as John Adams?  First, I was skeptical since I had seen Paul Giamatti in lots of other movies not based on history but I was pleasantly surprised at how much of an accomplished actor he is.  His protrayal of John Adams as one of the USA's Founding Fathers, its second President, and his role in the nation's first 50 years was dead on. And Laura Linney's as Abigail Adams was just as great as Paul's role.  And then, to see David Morse as George Washington?  Wow!  The makeup, etc was amazing!  Overall, it is a good series of movies to watch to fully understand what transpired with a significant part of our history.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show, actors are superb! Will probably watch it over and over.  Excellent scenery, etc. Thank you for this!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Ordered all the Son's Seasons except first one through Amazon. Was very pleased with the service. I ordered on a Pre-order. Waiting on Season 5 to be available. All dvd's were reasonalbly priced.
B00005R23S|5.0|It was for my husband for Christmas.  We watched it around New Year's Day, it was delivered on time and it was great!  Would recommend this DVD if you like Bruce Springsteen!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|...Great game a lot of the mini games were chalenging and the graphics and story line were awesome.  Looking forward to the next G 5 game.  I have played more expensive games with a lot less satisfaction.
B002WCLG48|2.0|There's maybe one or two decent stories, otherwise, the rest are pretty much garbage. The animation is poor and some of the stories are forgettable and goofy. I know one is meant to be as a joke, but it's a waste of space. It should've been on the extras or bonus material, instead of mixed in with the rest. Overall, I was looking for something that would add to the Halo Universe or just bring some new life to Halo. This did neither. I gave it two stars for the two introduction episodes and the last one. And even those weren't THAT great.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Everything That I order was what I expected. Got it on time. Love the product. No problems with the order
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is breathtaking.. just when u think u have heard it all, there's more. It is so intense and amazing! I did not want it to end, but love it. It's a must read!!!
0670451495|5.0|\\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" should be gifted to every baby by its fairy godparents.  I remember having it read to me when I was little and the clothes & cars of the illustrations were contemporary.  I read it to my sons, who loved the story of Mr and Mrs Mallard---that careful and competent mother of eight---and the compassionate policemen who stopped traffic right by the Boston Commons.  I ordered a copy from Amazon a few weeks ago for my great-granddaughter, loving it just as much as ever.<br /><br />Why does the book---the story and the illustrations---hold up so well over so many years and generations?  The story tells of a kindly world, such as would make a child feel secure, warm, and happy: the loving parent ducks, the island in the lake of the great park where the swanboats still glide, and the police who care enough about little ones to stop traffic so Mrs Duck can lead her small family across the streets and into their new home in the park.  The story tells also about a city, Boston, with the old squares, the state house, details from which the reader can take off with more stories for the little ones nestled close.  And the illustrations in brown crayon (I think) are magical, individuating the ducklings, catching the quirkiness of the good citizens of Boston, bringing to our today the life of one spring day long long ago.<br /><br />May you and your next generations delight in \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" too!
B006LSZECO|4.0|i enjoyed reading this book and would like to read some more of this author's writings.  I will check some more out later.
0525953728|5.0|A  Great book for reading, would recommend this to anyone interested in reading about Osama Bin Laden Raid. . .
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|I received order quickly, but when we played the disc, it was flawed both audio and visual near the half of the movie.  It last about 3 to 4 minutes, then continued with no other problems.  I was disappointed because I ordered a new disc.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept me intrigued to the very end.  I couldn't put it down once I started it.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but it certainly caught my attention.  I can't wait to read the second book, and then the third.  What a great series!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|An interesting, deep, thoughtful read. I'd definitely advise anyone to read it. I was glued to the book up until the end!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Not usually a young adult romance fan but decided to try it because of all the reviews.  I certainly was not disappointed.  Very good book with adult situations.  Loved the characters.
B00A9X9VAI|1.0|The film is very poorly directed and does not connect from segment to segment. The entire plot plan is flimsy. Very weak film - a waste of acting talent.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I LOVE Christmas movies and these are some of my favorites! I always bring them out when I am decorating and start enjoying the holidays!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really never review books, but I had to for this one.  This was just a wonderful book.  I was interested from page one and couldn't put it down.  It is one of those books that I will remember.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love  it!  Keeps me entertained especially  when I am sick!  Constantly challenging.  My son even enjoys playing Spider!<br /><br /> They should come up with a multiplayer version.
B007XC9BSK|4.0|Our grandson loves anything related to &#34;Cars&#34;, and we gave this to him for Christmas. I haven't really examined the thing. It was a lot smaller than I'd imagined, but I haven't heard from my daughter of any problems. It stores the teeny little cars that it was designed to hold and does provide some incentive for keeping them picked up and put away. I gave it 4 stars; the kid would probably give it 5.
0765325950|5.0|Everyone needs to quit rating this book badly just because it's not in e-form.  From what I have gathered from Brandon's website, that is not his choice - it's Harriott's and the publisher.  Personally, I'm just thankful that Brandon finished this series that I have been reading since 1980 something.  I pre-ordered the book on Amazon and received it today (1/8 the release date).
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This is not a funny movie, even for a viewer that practices graphic language. The humor seems to be the foul mouth of Ted. Not creative entertainment.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I bought these for the price and got what I expected.  Lightweight, good running / workout headphones but sound quality sucks.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Our whole family is addicted.  LOVE this show! This is the only show that has made my husband and I consider taking the leap and paying for satellite!!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I decided to give the reacher series a try because of the movie coming out. The killing floor was poorly titled (don't judge a book by its poorly titled cover). The book was way too long made it seem as though there was only one town in the whole country Margrave Georgia. No one else in the country could help the heroes no logic existed outside the writers imagination. I probably won't watch the movie because Tom Cruise isn't 6'6.
B002PE0HCU|5.0|What can I say about a classic?  My 10 and 12 year old found it very interesting and exciting too!
B000SW16NU|3.0|The movie was listed as the &#34;Directors Cut&#34; and was not. It turned out to be the original version which was good when it first came out, but after the real Director's Cut was released, the original version was missing so many scences that made this version only fair. The movie with the Director's Cut is excellent and I'd recommend that version and would advise anyone not to waste their money on the original version.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I always wondered about this book.  It got so much press and I finally had to read it.  Very BDSM, but nothing like I feared - more erotic.  Now I'll have to read the other two books to find out what happens to Christian and Anastasia.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie was funny, not hilarious, but funny.  I was a little disappointed.  But this might be added to my list of guilty pleasures.
1606995359|5.0|Beautiful reproduction! Vivid color! Made me relive my childhood (I learned to read by puzzling my way through Uncle Scrooge comics)
0765325950|1.0|I've been waiting for this book forever and now I have to wait longer. I'm sure I'll like what Jordan and Sanderson have accomplished but I'm giving it a bad rating until I've read it. I'll change it after I've read the book.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I wished there was less foul language, but the storyline was very good.  It was entertaining throughout!  It would be beneficial to have seen the previous MIBs.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|If you have read any of Jodi's other books, you will like this one.  It is a book that tugs at the heart of young love and friendships between both family and teenagers.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Lots of fun love it great game. Even the kidos like to play easy or hard 1 to 4 suits
B004MC8CA2|2.0|not very good for what it is its not what i had hoped for i would not recamand this bible to anyone
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Loved it. Really funny. I would watch it again. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it- made for a fun Friday night in.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|He did it again! I love Nicholas Sparks and how he writes! I can feel every emotion the characters feel!
B001UHOWXI|4.0|Great family movie, enjoyed it with my kids two days before christmas and its a memory my kids will never forget. Best of all timely delivery and cheaper than other retailers.
B003ITZBVI|3.0|Entertaining plot, the animation is great... but the drawings and designs of the characters, not up to what I expected. Anyway, you'll have a good time if you like good old bats...
B000KJT8IG|4.0|One of the best Chevy Chase films. Found it cheap in blu ray delivered in three days and enjoyed it multiple times since I received it.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|This was so beautiful. I cried, I laughed and cried some more. Tim Burton has a return to form after a period of staleness. The Blu Ray picture quality is stunning, pure reference quality, nothing tops this. I was treated with ParaNorman, now I am delighted with Frankenweenie. This has been a good year for stop motion fans. I only wish the film was a little longer. It is a horror enthusiasts dream wrapped up with a Disney wrapper.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Not awesome, but solid.  Some moments that seemed very low rent, but still had a good story line. I will probably watch again when this is free on Amazon Prime.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|You should get this game because it is awesome and entertaining and you can pass time and its fun to try to beat your family's scores.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|With such great actors I expected it to be a humorous fun adventure to India.  It was dull and rather depressing.  I bought it as a gift (unseen) for my father-in-law who just entered an assisted living home.  I finally got around to watching it and was so disappointed and worried it would depress my father-in-law.  I advised him NOT to watch it.  It may appeal to some, but if you are looking for  light humorous fun then I would suggest you skip it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is an experience.  Perfect for any and all age groups. It is extremely honest and doesn't try to be anything else but a fantastic read. I wish I had read this book while I was in high school for it provides insight into other people's behavior and comfort in knowing everyone has their own battles. Perfect!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Was pleased overall with the game, good story line, would have liked to have had more puzzles to solve with a little more action to do puzzles would have been good also.  Just seek and find apps are starting to become boring.
B003K15INU|2.0|This is absolutely the worst edited/formatted Kindle book I have read. It was clearly converted with OCR and then not edited by hand. There are an enormous number of errors in the text (wrong letter, mispunctuation, numbers instead of letters), possibly working out to one per page, but there are a couple sections where I was so frustrated that I almost stopped reading the book. Most of them are minor errors, but sometimes it seems like entire words are missing. Regardless, it's an unacceptable  number for a professionally released product from the publisher.
B004UID2LC|3.0|ok so I got this app it worked great at first then I removed it and it was still there but when I try to delete it is says it is not installed so it just sits there now
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Unfortunately, you see too many of the good bits when you see the trailer. Entertaining, but I don't think I would want to see it again.
0520224787|5.0|There is a great TV series on the You Tube, for folks interested in this book, the TV series can be a very good companion.<br />The acting and period set and costume are all excellent, the war scenes may be a little bit cruel by current standard. Overall an excellent TV production based on this book.<br /><br />You can search youtube:  Three Kingdoms (2010) Episode 1
B0089AD8IO|5.0|Discovered the Ninth Doctor after first starting watching Doctor Who during David Tennant's run.  He is an interesting character and really enjoy all Doctor Who episodes so far.
B004WE01YA|5.0|This is a classic!  My little princess loves it!  It has the dvd, blu ray, and digital copy, so we are never without it!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Do agree with other reviewers, G5 should indicate trial or demo version.Still, I liked<br /> enough to purchase full version. Plays well on Kindle Fire
B0042KA5EK|5.0|Great action and gadgets!  Very entertaining.  Great ending to the shows and there are some real surprises.  Really worth watching in order.
B000SGRONM|3.0|Not a badly written book, it just didn't hold my interest. Some humorous episodes, but a bit too much rambling for me. Simply a matter of taste
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a Good, funny read,,,waiting for a sequel, the book leaves you wanting more. Don't leave us hanging E. L.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Great dvd features. Great Movie!!<br /><br />It's amazing how Cameron includes, social, political, military, environmental and visual effects that are the best so far!
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Bought as a gift.  Great price and perfect condition. I have watched it and I really enjoyed it.  My friend loved it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think you need to be ready for what's inside this book. Every page was shocking and thrilling. I could never tell my mother to read this book! She's not a fan of this type of work... however I could not put it down! Read it in 3 days... would have done it sooner if I didn't have other things to do.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing! Kept you hanging on even to the last page! This is a forbidden must read! If you liked the hunger games your will love Catching Fire

B005LAIIQC|5.0|Item was received on time and I got this for my dad for Christmas/Bday gift he was so excited he loves it!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The song selections are great and the duet choices are excellent. This is  a great CD to get as the songs are  across the board favorites of anyone who has ever heard or attended a Broadway show. Susan Boyle sings as beautifully and as youthfully as ever. Her duets with Donny Osmond and Michael Crawford are fantastic.<br />This CD goes on my Favorites pile.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Item was received on time and I got this for my dad for Christmas/Bday gift he was so excited he loves it!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Funny Very Funny Laughed from the beginning to the end.  One of the bears funniest movies ever. Don't think he could have been any funnier.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|this game is just like mario but it needs more levels&hellip;my 2 year old loves this game. very addicting to play
B008OHV5HS|5.0|I jumped on board as a Threshold fan with their Dead Reckoning album & haven't looked back.  As I have moved backwards thru their catalog to include Subsurface, Critical Mass, & Hypothetical, each & every album has been a pleasure to listen to & I've often wondered how I missed out on this band all these years.  Needless to say they've become one of several favorite progressive metal bands for me.<br />March of Progress is my first exposure to Damian Wilson as the singer for Threshold & pretty much in general & I am truly impressed.  Great range, strong command of the songs and a wonderful clear tone without sounding operatic or overdone.  Enter the album itself, it is yet another extremely satisfying Threshold album with nods to the sounds of their entire catalog.  I was especially happy to see that the band did not try to out-heavy themselves from the last platter (a theme that far too many bands are doing nowadays).  Opening tune, Ashes, cuts right to it, upbeat with that catchy Threshold sound, a great mix of guitars, keyboards & lyrics.  Onward we continue without any letting up until we get to my favorite album track, Liberty, Complacency, Dependency.  Superb lyrics, really flowing melodic guitar work & a nice fast/riffy section in the middle of the song that makes its point then loops back around in the end to close out as started.  In essence there are no filler songs on this album, it is just a nice mix of up tempo, mid-paced songs & a ballad-like cut(Thats Why We Came) leading up to the most \\"progessive\\" sounding song on the album, Rubicon, being my 2nd favorite track rolling in at 10 minutes long.<br />After such a long hiatus I wasn't sure what to expect & didn't want to \\"fanboy\\" this review due to the jubilation of a new album, but the album is just superbly written and structured from beginning to end.  If you are already a fan you likely will love this.  I know after a good 15 spins of this CD, I'm not mistaken at the overall quality.  And to think Damian is also singing on Headspace-I Am Anonymous(another fantastic album) amazes me even further at how busy this guy has been & the quality output in one year.mian is also singing on Headspace-I Am Anonymous(another fantastic album) amazes me even further at how busy this guy has been & the quality output in one year.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I reallly like this app it helps and is really fun to use I think that if u need to do math fast it the right app
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|I like the fact that all the people seem like real people and not cardboard cutouts (Including the women!)  The pace was good and the situation of the ending unexpected.  Sometimes gloomy, but rational and with bright spots to keep you going.  Very believable hero
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the game is so tough it they came out with a second one I would totally buy it now bought about ti
B0055OMBIU|5.0|Got this for my parents-in-law, who are puzzle fanatics, and they loved it!!  Great Christmas gift, or whenever gift. I wish they would make Seattle or Portland, but probably not enough history to build on.
0765325950|1.0|Kindle version delayed for three months means I will borrow it from a friend and NOT buy it. Or I'll find where to download a free copy and still NOT buy it.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|I'm a Nintendo/Monopoly geek and I love this game!!  I've been playing Mario since I was 10 and now my kids enjoy Mario and his cast of friends as well.  Bringing it to life in Monopoly made me go SQWEEE!!! :)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This movie set was brand new at a decent price, even though Warner Brothers has these on lock down in the vault for now.
0545265355|5.0|This was what my daughter wanted for Christmas...she got it!  She loves this series, and so do I.  Great books!
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This was an unexpected pleasure.  The acting was solid, the story line had great humor mixed with very good special effects.  Almost believable. Look forward for the sequel!
B003EEMIV8|5.0|This is a great toy.  Well made, lots of neat features that are easy to view while in action, like the gears for the compactor.  My kid spends a lot of time pushing this trash truck across the house.  I knew this was a big truck, but was just surprised just how large it is when seeing it in person.
B008H6GHL0|5.0|Great story. The story combined elements from several of the Resident Evil game series. Having Leon S. Kennedy as the<br />protagonist of the story, with Ada Wong there, as usual helping Leon, to some extent, along the way. A very good story for<br />any Resident Evil fan.
B000000WFZ|1.0|What a disappointment! Nothing but a series of very short snippets of music, with the entire CD running well under an hour in length.<br />I purchased the CD based in large part upon the glowing reviews, as well as hearing some of the composer's other film music.<br />After listening, I cannot comprehend all the praise; this score left me cold and uninspired. I will never listen to it again; wish I could return it to Amazon for a refund.<br />Much ado about nothing, and overpriced to boot. I would give it zero stars if I could.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a really cute movie. I laughed out loud at Rebel Wilson.... Good rental choice for anyone looking for a few laughs.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked this one. There was some timing and spelling errors, but other than that well done. The graphics were pretty good too.
