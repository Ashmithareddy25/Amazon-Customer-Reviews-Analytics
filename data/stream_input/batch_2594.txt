0802473156|5.0|This was an easy, quick read, but don't confuse that with meaning it was casual in it's content.  The message is applicable to all.  I am trained as a scientist, so I need some stats and studies in self-help books, which are supplied here in just the right amount. I can't imagine this book being Inappropriate for anyone.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This has been a very useful tool. Not only is it a simple application to use but also very attractive.  Would recommend this to all.
B0091REZMW|4.0|easy to follow directions. quick start! enjoyed the story line. kept my attention and was never boring! I could easily hand it to my partner without a lot of explaining!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Goes on any droid.  Works well and allows you to look up words while you are reading.  A good way to borrow library books
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|awesome!!! now i remember those days. as robin williams once said,  if you remember the sixties you were not there&#34;.
B009M2T7K6|2.0|If you are going to use this in a lake or pool or the ocean, it would be fine.  But I bought it for my granddaughter to use in the bathtub and it doesn't work there.
B002GIBVV6|5.0|Movie came during shipping window.  Package and condition was as expected. We were actually headed on a road trip.  I passed it to the back seat where the kids promptly put it in the DVD player and watched the whole thing on our car ride.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|every time I open it it just closes out and goes back to my home screen! this is really annoying now I cannot even play the game! someone needs to fix this!!!!!!!!!!!
1416972242|5.0|OMG I LOVE THIS BOOK SO MUCH!!!!!!! CITY OF ASHES IS SO DELICIOUSLY GOOD OMG!!!!!! FANGIRLING SO MUCH OVER JACE!!!!!!!!!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I've had this game since it was the FAOTD and have played it a lot. Love puzzle games like this. Only drawback is pay-for-cheats offering screens. With many online walk-throughs, you dont need 'em.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie right here is one word: AMAZING. It gave me tons of feels though and made me cry a lot.
B0087GF8ZG|2.0|The light goes out quick. It also is not very bright, does not serve much of a purpose because it is not bright.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Omg i love harry potter and this movie made me cry a lot. It's amazing though. You should buy it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I always disliked the &quot;can you escape?&quot; kind of games because I would never be able to actually escape. But this game is slightly challenging but nothing extreme. its a good way to pass the time. :)
1416972250|5.0|THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER!!!!! OMG FANGIRLING OVER CLACE SO MUCH IN THIS BOOK!!!!!!! OMG THERE ARE SOME TWISTS IN THIS BOOK THOUGH
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and entertaining. Downloaded and played while my daughter was napping and had a nice relaxing time. Would definitely recommend to others!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|It really went with the book ideas! I can't wait for another characters point of view! They really out did themselves
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|Good quality recording, and music arrangement is beautiful.<br />Creative, talented performer musicians, they keep classical and popular tune together, I enjoy the music very much.  If anyone don’t know them, try you tube to watch video first.  It’s very touching and very artistic.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|This is Kanye's most polarizing album ever as he has taken on a new approach...he made a album for himself, not the fans and it features all kinds of different styles from punk hip hop to electronic to auto-tune. I dig it, the production is great, however the lyrics are lazy and the albums seems rushed probably cause Kanye re-did the album with Rubin a week before its release. Critics are enamored with it and fans either love it or hate it. I expect it to get 3 1/2 stars or 4 here on Amazon, I am also getting to read all the criticism, as those are always entertaining.A note: do not get over aggressive with all the 1 and 2 star reviews, just cause you love it does not mean others will. Overall a solid effort..best tracks include the club banger 'Send It Up','Bound 2', 'On Site'.
B000AV2G3I|5.0|Everything you remember & love about John Lennon's post Beatle musical career is covered here from the iconic song Give Peace a Chance through his posthumous release of Grow Old With Me. This is a great collection of music and a must for any Lennon fan to add to there music collection.
B00AFZ86BA|5.0|Several other reviewers have said that these CD's have been re-mastered but this is not the case. This is simply the first 5 (well, excluding the RATT EP) RATT albums, put together in one package for resale. If you are like me, and have lost most of your RATT CD's over the years, or have had them scratched by your kids borrowing them, then this is a great way to re-purchase them all for a low price, and have them all in one nice, neat little package. There is no extra material here, no re-mastered tracks.<br /><br />I think this may be a primer of sorts because the original surviving members of RATT are now back together (A first in 22 years!), and are rumored to be in the studio recording a new record.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Too much repetition. Is it me or is Ana getting dumber? She started off as a bright, intelligent, young lady and now...I understand we all have that need to want to save someone but Christian has too many issues and she never gets a moment to herself to just think. He's exhausting and reading about him made me exhausted.
B002KKCXTE|5.0|This Fathers Day, my girlfriend presented me with a beautifully wrapped, nearly perfectly square cube.<br />I unwrapped it, and found this exact item underneath! I do not know where she got it from, or how much she paid for it, but my boxed set IS this exact set - with all 10 feature movies (excluding the 2009 \\"Star Trek\\" and 2013 \\"Into Darkness\\" releases)! As far as I can tell, these Blu-ray disks are region free and have a VAST number of different language subtitle options (about 15-20 languages).<br />This set also includes a Bonus disk with the Captains Summit, and other bonus material. Every single disk has bonus material that I've never seen before such as behind the scenes making of the films, set creation, cast and crew interviews, very in-depth coverage of the finale of \\"The Star Trek Experience\\" at the Las Vegas Hilton, and much, much more.<br /><br />As for the quality of the movies themselves, they are ALL sharp and crisp, colors are vibrant and sound is spectacular if you have a decent 5.1 or 7.1 setup!<br /><br />I wish I could say where my girlfriend got this and what she paid. If I can get it out of her, I'll update this review.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|DanielDay-Lewis is a British born actor who, as far as I'm concerned is the finest actor alive today. He doesn't get the publicity of guys like Matt Damon, Brad Pitt or Denzel Washington, but he outshines them by a mile. In my opinion, he is the finest actor in movies today. You can have your Matt Damons, Brad Pitts & Denzel Washingtons; I think when all is said<br />& done he will be in a class with the great Sir Lawrence Olivier.<br />Having said that the plot of the movie is about a man who becomes an oil baron after he strikes his first well in 1898, probably in Texas. I don't want to give it away but for various reasons, but he is a driven man. You'll want to see this one. Highly recommended, and thanks for reading my short review.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Intriguing story about the dark side of a person's psyche and how much we really know each other.  If you want to read a book that will give you something to really think about, this is the book for you as there are quite a few discussion points that are open for interpretation.<br /><br />Being from Massachusetts and understanding the society in the town the story is set in made this book a little easier to delve into, but I'm sure that town could be any suburb of any city.  It was very easy to identify with both the mother and father of Jacob, and Landay writes in a way that made me truly understand the internal conflict they were experiencing.<br /><br />My schedule does not allow me to always be able to read for long periods of time, so there were times that a few days (to a week) would pass before I could pick the book up again, which made reading this book a little more difficult.  It is not a book that allows you to come back to it later, due to little details you may forget.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good story and will get you to think.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|This book is very accurate and helpful. I suggest this book to all people. It has factual writing and is entertaining. Buy this book now!
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Ok, this movie totally deserves 5 stars. It is hilarious. Funny from start to finish and has some awesome characters. If you haven't seen it yet and have no issues with drugs, sex and laughing then don't read another review. Just rent it or buy it and love Wanderlust! Oh, then come back here and write another 5 star review, so we can get the stars up on this one. Do it...you know you wanna...
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|It's an amusing twist on a classic puzzle game, but it's not quite what I expected based on all the rave reviews I've heard.
0307720950|5.0|Read it in 2 days.  Easy read, author uses his personal story well and the information is right up to date with today.  If you are in product development or design, read this book.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|Though others have said much about this product already, I will add to their praise and say that as a long-time fan of Conan the Barbarian and Basil Poledouris' inimitable score, I was quite pleased to at last get my hands on this collection. Though I have long loved the original 1982 release of the soundtrack, there were many tracks from the film not released on the album. Happily, the 3-disc complete score has them all--or at least as many of them as I am able to perceive. I do not doubt this set will be in my regular rotation for many years to come.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Once again Gillian Flynn has written a novel that was all consuming. Her capacity to create unexpected twists and turns through the story line is excellent.  I don't like reading books where events are predictable and hers are definitely not predictable. She also has a wonderful skill of twisting reader loyalties from one character and then the next as she shares their viewpoints.<br />Read it, but only if you don't mind finishing it realizing you have done nothing else all afternoon!
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|So very proud of this band and their accomplishments. GREAT BUY!<br />This album truly shows their growth over the years. WAY beat out all expectations.<br />Been a fan for many years and will be for many more.<br />Must check it out, you will not regret it.
1608955702|4.0|Very pleased with examples which he calls plates, and the text so far. I have yet to finish the book but it looks good to me.
0385349947|5.0|I am a career woman of 30 years. This book holds true for me. Most women are much better than they believe themselves to be.  Sheryl Sandberg has done an excellent job of conveying the message. Hold self confidence high and reach for more more than we believe we are capable of achieving.<br />Excellent read and a book to go back to many times.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Best simulator in my opinion because it has awesome graphics and sweet guns and the look real my personal favorite is the Browning.
B00797MB0O|1.0|The good news is that it does end.<br />The bad news is that i continued to watch this thinking the ending would somehow redeem the time I wasted watching it.  It starts out with a sad girl full of regrets when she gets a really bad Idea and acts on it.  Now if this were played by Jim Carey in drag it could be funny as hell but sadly it is not comedy.  Not funny, not entertaining but if you are considering suicide this could help you make up your mind for sure.  If you were a cheer leader in high school.... I would opt out of this one.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Nothing short of great work, I loved it. This will remain in my kindle,phone as well as my deaktop well worth it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a firm believer in life after death. This book let's me know I'm not the only one out there who believe but the writer do to. Without giving details of this novel be prepared to feel and think outside the box. Everyone isn't fortunate enough to have love every after the first time around. Sometimes it the second and /or third time around.<br />TS
B000002O4X|5.0|My mother loved this movie, partly for the music. I don't care for the movie that much, but the music left an impression on me. So much so, that i began accumulating John Barry soundtracks anywhere possible, from King Kong to Dances With Wolves.<br /><br />Now, his ST music is my commute listening. Can't get enough!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A very book couldn't put it down. I like happy ending s. But this one really surprised me. A must read.
0307346617|5.0|I read Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide first and was surprised how much i liked this book! Its a true genre-bending page turner. It hits the right balance on 'retrospective', action, zombie, human interest and much more. Each vignette is so believable: chinese village, south african ghetto, army units, black market surgeons...<br /><br />You're not likely to be disappointed!
B00CX1TSSO|2.0|It was such a great preview but such a let down. I am really bummed that i bought it and really wish they had it for rent and not to buy cause i was not worth it.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|So many people recommended this book to me, but I just couldn't love it. If I don't like the characters I have a hard time liking the book (same problem I had with Gone Girl).  It wasn't for me.  The characters were flawed, the science of a murder gene was flawed, the plot was flawed. I cannot defend this book.
B00006AG5N|5.0|My friend enjoys it immensely!!! A lot of good music for the money..well worth it. Thanks for the good deal!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Would make an excellent movie I didn't want to put it down, can't wait to read more of the Silo Saga.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show is amazing!  It is funny and witty!  I love all of the different quirks that the  characters have.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a very fun game but be careful it can be quiet addictive. Overall, though I recommend it to you. It is fun, and better yet it is FREE!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love puzzle games like this. You have to figure out all the clues to get the keys. Not too hard but not too simple either. have fun and good luck. Keep the levels coming!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It needs more levels, maybe harder ones as well. It's fun and it passes time. Hope you enjoy. Great game
1433502410|5.0|I got this for my son's graduation.  Very pleased with both quality and content.  I personally like my NASB Thompson chain reference because it's neutral, being free of commentary and great for in depth searches.  But the commentary in this Bible is as close to neutral as you can get with commentary.  That combined with the ESV translation I think made it a perfect choice for a young man's first heavy-duty Bible.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good book I really loved how intimate and romantic the relationship of the two characters really is. I would re comment
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I always am inspired at the journey the human soul takes. We never stop evolving unless we choose not to.<br />I only purchase movies that I can pass on with my friends. This is a keeper. Not only watch it but dicuss your part in your journey with others. It will make a difference. Thank you Matthew Settle for the movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked it. I had me guessing every step of the way.  It is a good way to pass time.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the show and wish I knew where I could continue watching and do they make the show. It makes me happy and helps me to relax.  Love the characters and the writing.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game has been a good way to fill time while I'm on break. It's easy to get into, but it still gives you a bit of a challenge.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is really fun sceptically I think there should be a final quest or game before you win it is a bit inaptopriate with all the sec stuff don't combine human human or sec sec sec really is s e x but it is a good game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm not one to get excited over any video games or anything super techy but this game has helped to keep me busy. It could use some digital upgrades but other than that it works very well! I highly suggest this game for young kids who have a side with a love for animals! :)
1567184855|5.0|Yes we will be more alive, in spirit, when we shed this old body.  Why we ever wanted to experience this life is beyond me.  As humans we think that we know it all,  far from it.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 had great characters and the traditional SMT fusion system. If you are a fan of any jRPG, give this a shot.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Beautiful. The flow....the magical realism...the Zen...the sense of different cultures and histories and generations and shape shifting all made for delectable reading.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app. to help me sleep or relax. I have tinnitus and can't sleep without some type of white noise. Plus with tinnitus this app. is the closest I get to silence if I want to meditate. If you too have tinnitus I recommend external speakers as they provide a fuller sound that distracts me better than the kindle fire speakers. I use computer speakers: CREATIVE inspire T12. I have not had any problems with this app. as some other reviewers have mentioned.
B003PHJLR8|5.0|First of all, this has always been one of my favorite movies. When I saw that it was on Blu-ray I was so excited! Then I realized it's a region B disc. I had to google what that meant and then realized I'd need a special DVD player for that. So I got one (An Orei, which works nicely if you were wondering). Played beautifully and the picture looks fantastic on Blu-ray. Really makes the experience better.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game. My granddaughter and I take turns to see who can get the farthest. Poor fells never stands a chance with me.
B0053O89U6|5.0|If you love this show, you will be satisfied with this, obviously! This was a great season in the show and it looks great on blu-ray. Go for it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is not a waist of time. great game for my kids. they get along everyday. but not the way they do when they play this game.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This was a gift. I got this for my dad. He couldn't find it anywhere so I got it for him on here. The price is right for a relatively rare DVD and I was informed the remastering and overall quality was great!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love this movie, been a big Marvel fan since I was a kid.  The dvd case was wrapped in plastic and it was in very good condition.  I would recomend to anyone interested.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so fun!!! My friend loves minecraft and I didn't know what minecraft was at the time so i got minecraft pe. It was the best game ever! I think its great for kids all ages. Its your creation. Though i need to figure out how to update mine. Do they have wolfs cuz my friend said they do in updated version?
B009186JYI|4.0|Very entertaining music; love the Stones.  Just wish there could have been more concert footage showing the guitar work of Keith and Brian, but what you do get is exciting.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I really enjoyed the game it get addicting but the flying gets repetitive after awhile but its cool and it needs more stages and takes forever to unlock and build suits if you choose not to spend money which I ain't gon do.and u should be able to store more suits than 4!and this game desperately needs more stages!! overall it was good if your a fan of the movie but if you love the comic like me it is a lil dissapointin!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love Kindle for Android don't need to carry a book every where now always with me on my phone. It's great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game... its easy enough for my 6 yr old to play with me but challenging enough for me to enjoy as well .... just wish their were more rooms!
B00DE0RQM8|5.0|Britney can do no wrong, this is such a fun summer song! Perfect for the Smurfs movie. Make sure to buy it!
030788743X|5.0|I rarely buy books as I have run out of shelf space. I bought this book. If you grew up in the 80's, if you like games, if you were/are a nerd, this book is for you. I loved it!
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I enjoyed this book of essays. Enjoyed is actually too mild a word ... I loved Me Talk Pretty One Day as much as I love dark chocolate and good wine. This was th we first time I had the pleasure of reading David Sedaris's work, and I can't wait to delve into his other books!
B004RUMZ2U|5.0|There are folks who are big fans of Agatha Christie and there are the folks who are not. This is okay because everyone has their own taste when it comes to just about everything from soap to cars to dogs to food and of course books. This wonderfully wide range of interests and tastes makes the world a more interesting place. Now I fall with the camp who admires the writing and stories Ms Christie churned out consistently for many, many years. To be honest, I have not read a Christie mystery that I did not like; on one level or another. This book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is no exception.<br /><br />Most Christie admirers will know that, if or no other reason, this particular novel stands out because it was her first published novel and it is the novel where her most famous character, Hercule Poirot is introduced. This work was published in 1920 and has actually been a best seller since that day.<br /><br />There are many publications, many versions of this book available. The particular publication I am reviewing here is from Black Dog & Leventhal Publishers, a publisher who apparently is attempting to reissue all Christie's work, one volume at a time. This is a good hardcover version of this book. I can tell you right now that I have several other version of this book in my library; all are adequate with the exception of the Kindle version which is sort of wretched.<br /><br />The story takes place in an upper middle class home during WWI. It is a typical Christie novel with the locked door scenario, poisoning and a nicely done mixing of the English classes prevalent at the time the book was written. Here are plenty of logical red herrings present and a very complex plot to pick through. There is also the famous Christie surprise ending.<br /><br />If this novel is read closely, the reader will find that the setting, characters, lifestyle and attitudes are taken straight from Christie's own life. You can catch glimpses of Agatha's own life throughout this entire novel. One thing about it, even though this is her first novel her genius shines through on each page and it is a good first novel by any standards.<br /><br />Younger readers may at first be put off by the author's syntax and writing method. It is different than what we find today. Of course this work was written over 90 years ago so that is to be expected and to be quite frank, treasured. I recently spoke with a number of teen readers who had read one of this author's novels as a class project. Several of them were dismayed at the lack of graphic violence, lack of sexual situations and two were devastated that there were no vampires or werewolves involved. That is all fine and good...I know tastes change over the years, but to the frank, I wanted to cry just a bit.<br /><br />One side note I would like to make. Many people miss the humor in Christie's writing. A good example of this is the fact that over the years many have noted that Hastings, the narrator of this story (He is a sort of Dr. Watson to Poirot) is incredibly \\"thick,\\" to the point of being down right stupid. Christie did this on purpose and admits to it in several delightful passages in chapter 8 during a conversation between Hastings and Poirot...subtle though it may be, it is hilarious.<br /><br />I enjoyed this read and am sure I will continue reading it as I slowly sink into my dotage in years to come.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkstire novel.

0062255657|5.0|The Hempstock farm is a special place -- a pond is an ocean, monstrous things lurk in the forests, and an old lady may have lived longer than the world.<br /><br />Welcome to \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane,\\" an exquisite short novel that shows anew why Neil Gaiman is one of the best authors alive. Part fantasy, part horror and part coming-of-age tale, this bewitching story is made even more beautiful because of Gaiman's clever use of magic, mystery and a villain who would seem silly in any other story.<br /><br />As a child, the protagonist was shy, bookish and didn't really have any friends... until he met Lettie Hempstock. She was a strange girl living with her ancient grandmother and mother, who claims to have an ocean on her family farm -- and when she takes him exploring in the woods on her property, they encounter strange and sometimes dangerous creatures.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of those is a monstrous ancient being made of canvas and rotted wood, which follows him home. And once she takes the form of a human woman, she begins to torment the young boy and tear apart his family. His only hope may be Lettie and the Hempstock women -- but the solution for the monster may be even worse.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of Neil Gaiman's storytelling is that he never shows you everything. There are glimpses of other worlds, ancient creatures, strange magic, but he never kills the magic by overexplaining. There is just enough magic, horror and timeless mystery to stoke your imagination, but not enough to bog down the story.<br /><br />A lot of that comes from the Hempstocks, whose true natures and powers are never truly outlined -- all we know is that they are ancient and powerful, particularly the grandmother. And their farm -- including the mysterious \\"ocean\\" -- is a place of magic that both enthralls and terrifies. Gaiman's prose is exquisite (\\"The silk filled with candle flames moved then, a slow, graceful, under-the-water sort of a movement\\") and sharply descriptive.<br /><br />He also has a rare gift for getting into the mind of a child -- the unnamed protagonist is young enough to still accept the strange and weird, but old enough to realize the enormity of what is happening. He also grows up as the story proceeds, learning to defy the cruelty of the adults around him (like his emotionally-abusive father) and gaining the courage to fight the canvas-creature.<br /><br />And despite their weirdness, the Hempstocks are pretty fun characters too, especially the doughty grandmother who may be older than the universe. Lettie is a particularly intriguing character, both an ancient power and a sprightly little girl, as opposed to the rotten, malevolent Ursula.<br /><br />\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\" is a magical book in every way -- a coming-of-age tale about horror, enchantment and a farm that is not what it seems. The best book (so far) of 2013.rply descriptive.<br /><br />He also has a rare gift for getting into the mind of a child -- the unnamed protagonist is young enough to still accept the strange and weird, but old enough to realize the enormity of what is happening.

I had already saw the movie a while ago and thought it would be interesting book. Both the movie and book is interesting.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome. I love trying to find the clues I would recommend it to all my friends.  I really over did it the first night I downloaded it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game. It's really simple to play. But, it's very hard to collect gems, even when you try to save them. When I first started out, there were no ads, but now they pop up after you do a mini game. All in all, I will take the ads, and keep on playing, because it is free, so what can I complain about. :) I highly recommend, especially if you love horses.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was really challenging. and kept me busy for about 2 hours.  can't wait for more levels.  hopefully they are created soon.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|You need to listed to the entire album this is a great album, is something new, this is ART, innovation Kanye dit it again.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Kanye West has completely fell off he has gone POP and doesn't do a good job at it what happened to the soul samples??? What's with the crappy club music?? This is one of the worst albums I ever heard in my life I think I liked 1 song on Yeezus which was \\"Bound 2\\" the last song on the album that actually sounds like vintage Kanye West smfh if you thought Electric Circus, UMC, Blueprint 2, Kingdom Come, Vol. 3, Nastradamus, Curtis, 808's and Heart Break were terrible well guess what this is even worse how can you not come up with 10 classic tracks??? Wow just wow Kanye you just lost a fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play it all the time and I saved up to $600000 because I got 300000 just from a super mystery box!
B008QTVNUI|4.0|We cannot stop watching. It is an amazing and contemporary story with some traditional features (villains, heroes, friendship, treason, love, etc). Highly recommend it. Not for kods though.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|It was well written and it went fast.  Unfortunately I read it in two short sittings.  Worth every minute of it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas sparks has once again stole my heart with his novel, Safe Haven. It is an amazing story, and really reminds you of what true love really is. As a 15 year old, I can only hope that one day I find true love like in this book. I recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a good love story full of romance.
0440238609|4.0|I loved the series and was really wrapped up in it, but the ending left me feeling pretty empty. It was so beautifully set up and imagined, I guess it couldn't live up to my expectations. Still great concepts and imagery though. Will need to reread to reevaluate.
0140177396|3.0|I had to read this book for school. I didn't hate it, but it certainly wasn't my favorite book. I especially disliked the ending (which I won't spoil).
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Wonderful book. Wove together common British folklore and mythology beautifully with a seemingly mundane memory. A nice, quick read with a satisfying bittersweet ending.

B00AESN8XY|1.0|I spent a dollar on the game and I bought the necora virus. I restarted my Kindle an  now it wants me to buy it again.
0061801313|4.0|Not to sound cliched, but my daughter thinks these novels are better than the TV series.  While, granted, a novel usually has the ability to include more details and build characters and plots better than a 20min episode on television does, she also thinks the books and TV series compliment one another well.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Hansel and Gretel are alive and well and they're living in Berlin. She is a cocktail waitress, he had a part in a Fasbender film. And they sit around at night now, drinking schnapps and gin. And she said:<br /><br />Hansel. You're really bringing me down. And he said<br />Gretel? You can really be a bitch.<br /><br />He said I've wasted my life! On our stupid legend. When my one and only love. Was the wicked witch.<br /><br />(Ah, Laurie Anderson is freakin' amazing for that) Sorry. on to the actual movie review...<br /><br />This is a really cool movie that was action packed from start to end and didn't have any slow points really as it told the \\"What if this happened?\\" tale of Hansel and Gretel. Love, Love - LOVE Jeremy Renner. He's amazing in every role I've seen from Dahmer to Hurt Locker to this. Not really for kids below 13 and some of the bad witches are pretty scary for kids perhaps. Teens and young adults are probably more the crowd they were aiming for. The weapons are bad ass, as are the costumes and actors. It's good vs. evil & a twist I won't spoil your movie with revealing here. Worth a rental for sure and even a repeated viewing some rainy day though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game.  It allows you to create and use your mind to build almost anything.  Plus you can take it on the go.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|First of all, Jennifer Lawrence is great in this. It's an alright movie but? Academy? Ok... I guess if you say so. Then again, I despise The Hangover and look at how well that does, so perhaps Bradley Cooper pulls 'em in. It's about a rather unlikeable guy and his incredibly OCD father who obsesses over sports. Maybe that is also why I didn't care for this film and I'm being biased? If you are looking for a rom-com, I would say this fits that bill. If you like a guy who seems prickish for a good 3/4ths of the movie before redeeming himself in some manner - by all means add this to your queue. In fact, if that is your type of movie, watch Buffalo 66 it's 100 times better than this one. The one redeeming thing about Silver Linings Playbook is Jennifer Lawrence's character. Well acted and brilliantly pulling the other characters in the movie together while helping Bradley Cooper get his head out of his 4th point of contact - she brings a lot to the table and made watching a sports movie with grumpy, typical guys more bearable. Not really one I'll clamor to view again anytime soon.
B00C2IPB66|5.0|This steelbook of Gladiator is as good as you can currently get.<br /><br />Perhaps the first two reviewers would prefer the old release of Gladiator on blu ray where so many people complained about the Digital Noise Reduction and Edge Enhancement that this remastered blu ray was produced. Perhaps they would prefer the DVD.<br /><br />Gladiator was shot on 35mm film. Film has grain. I much prefer to see the film grain than to view something that has been excessively processed and treated, but some people would prefer all blu rays to look like they were shot on digital HD cameras. And some people like to find fault with everything.<br /><br />Just look at the amazon reviews for the 'regular' Gladiator blu ray and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />This steelbook rates as 5 stars. You get a two blu ray set of Gladiator, including the Theatrical version, the Extended version and a disc full of special features.  All this in a very nice steelbook package, that at the time of writing is $9.99, less than the regular 'Saphhire Series' release.  Only the German steelbook artwork looks better.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I wanted to like it, I really did. I like Tom Cruise and action movies are fun. Trouble is, this isn't really an action movie. It wants to be one. There are a few moments here and there. It's almost like they followed a formula. Insert fight scene here, now maybe a car chase, ah gotta have a gun fight or two and another fight scene & DONE. Yawn. There are definite lag points in this movie & I don't wish to give away what will happen in case you are still committed to finding out if these are going to be two hours well spent or if you're going to be like me and wish you had that time back in the end. But the one scene with Werner Herzog and the baddie henchman was laughably ridiculous. Hmm, now on second thought the movie may be worth it just to laugh at how ridiculous that whole part of the movie was in fact. Sort of how Gothika was a total bomb except the one scene where Halle Berry is driving and turns around to laugh hysterically only to turn back around and scream. Collateral was a better Tom Cruise as a bad ass movie. This one needs to keep reachin' for some more action scenes to fill in things.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|One of my favorite movies of last year. The blu-ray transfer is perfect. You won't be disappointed. The best sci-fi movie since empire strikes back.
1596680296|2.0|I recall only finding one type of heel construction explained in any depth in this book, which was severely disappointing since I had bought the book to learn more about different techniques. This book came off kind of 'cheap' somehow, like the type of book that's hastily churned out as a holiday book. The information is solid, just only really talks about one type of construction. I wish I could return it.<br /><br />This is probably a very good book for a beginner, but for someone looking to learn more, I recommend Charlotte Shurch's \\"The Sock Knitter's Handbook: Expert Advice, Tips, and Tricks\\" -- which I found to be a far superior reference and general learning book.

B008UZ7MUI|3.0|Although the movie was decent it was a huge let down.  The story line was just....boring.  The 3D wasn't very good either.  I never read the books so I don't have the real thing to compare it to.  So I am basing this off the series.  The last two movies didn't even leave me wanting for more.

140123769X|4.0|The Fables are back again in a new collected volume and up to plenty of antics.  Willingham is still putting the pieces together for the next big saga of Fables and the blossoming full story isn't clear yet, but readers are having a lot of fun along the way with the different subplots.  Snow White and Bigby wolf have always known that one of their cubs was destined for a great role, and its seems like it's been filled when Winter begins training for the role of the North Wind, but each cub has a prophecy and some are fulfilled in this 18th volume, Cubs in Toyland.<br /><br />Therese is an easily confused child, and when she finds herself a toy boat that talks to her, she is more than gullible.  The cub is led on a journey to a river, where the toy boat enlarges to a real-sized one.  She hops on and is taken across a great ocean through storm and sea until she reaches an island of broken and discarded toys, the misfits of toy society who all have voices and personalities.  They want little in life but to have a new queen to love them.  Therese thinks she might be this person, but soon discovers there is no food on the island, and begins to starve, while the incessant toys turn her into a dark and twisted person as time passes.<br /><br />Darien is the leader of the pack and has always known he is the hero and must do everything he can, no matter what he takes.  He follows the clues about his missing sister and crosses the great ocean to find this distant land of mutated toys and knows what he must do to save his sister.<br /><br />Cubs in Toyland is a great stand-alone story of the Fables universe, exploring some of the roles that the cubs of Snow and Bigby are destined to fulfill, pushing and pulling on the emotions of the reader, as they are ultimately just children, even if they are fables.  Included in the collection is the story of Bufkin in the Land of Oz, illustrated by Shaw McManus.<br /><br />Originally written on February 11, 2013 ©Alex C.

1401224792|4.0|Fables is back once again with its next installment, this time with a standalone graphic novel that has been rumored about for some time, in Werewolves of the Heartland.  Taking a little break from the goings on of Fabletown, The Farm, and the other worlds, we focus on Bigby traveling through America's heartland.    Bigby Wolf is on a big new mission: to find a new town, a new place to house all the fables in the mundy world, because after everything that's happened with Fabletown, they can't stay there much longer.  Traveling through the great state of Iowa, he finds a small quaint place called Story City, what better name for a potential future home for all the fables?  But Bigby detects strange scents on the air, some that are familiar, and others that just don't seem right.  Cautiously, he ventures into Story City.    The first thing Bigby notices about this town is that all of its inhabitants are werewolves, and what's more they all seem to know who he is, as well as about his great legacy.  But then he is suddenly imprisoned, and begins to learn that not all are fans of him; some want his hide; some want him dead so that they can gain his powers.  What none of them seem to realize is that Bigby is also the seventh son of the North Wind, and possesses powers they can only imagine.    Werewolves of the Heartland shows Willingham at his best, as he draws you in with interest, and then blows the plot wide open with back story that goes deep into the past when Bigby was fighting in World War II and revealing his forced part in a terrifying Nazi experiment that has now led to the werewolves of Story City.  Readers and fans will not be disappointed.    Originally written on January 7, 2013 ©Alex C. Telander.    For more reviews, check out the BookBanter site: [...]
B004WR125O|5.0|Simple setup, never an issue or problem with it.  Really enhances our TX-NR616 with all of the web-based capability, channels, etc.  Would've been great if it had been built-in, but it's a great, simple addition -- and not TOO pricey for what you get.
B000E6EGXM|3.0|I first encountered Britten's \\"War Requiem\\" in 1970 while still in high school, and through this very recording, which may well have been the only recording of the piece available at the time (though I seem to recall another recording being out there on some indie label). Interesting to consider that the War Requiem was barely 8 years old when I first heard it.<br /><br />I was bowled over by the piece and it became one of my listening staples, at least until my repertoire knowledge went into overdrive when I moved to NYC. I had quite the Cambrian explosion of music in those years, which fostered a lifelong love of Bruckner and Verdi, among others.<br /><br />Britten's magnum choral opus didn't get listened to that much by me during that period, but neither did many of my other youthful favorites. Still, I'd pull the recording down off the shelf every couple of years, give it a listen and feel satisfied in encountering an old friend. When CDs came around, I replaced my London LPs immediately. I replaced my CDs once again when a 24/96 remix came out back in the late 90s or early 2000's.<br /><br />In the meanwhile, I heard the piece performed twice: the first time at Carnegie Hall with the Cleveland Orchestra and Chorus under Lorin Maazel, and later with the NY Philharmonic under Kurt Masur at Avery Fisher. I hate to say it, but hearing the piece live had the effect of putting me off the thing. It all seemed so overwrought and overwritten, bordering on kitsch, in fact. Let's face it, there's nothing worse than music that from its very inception seeks to be profound. It only gets worse when the performers involved employ their own \\"profound\\" gestures and poses to let us know what a deeply moving experience we're all supposedly having.<br /><br />My reaction was to bow out of attending live performances and to stick to listening to recordings of the piece, where one could at least avoid the \\"meaningful gestures\\" of the principles.<br /><br />As the years rolled on, the War Requiem stopped coming down off my shelves with any frequency. It got to the point where I had so stopped having an interest in the piece that I eventually divested myself of the multiple recordings I owned (this one, Hickox, Shaw, Rattle) and plunked the trade-in money down on sets of Sibelius & Bruckner symphonies. Mind you, I still had plenty of Britten operas and choral works in my collection. But the War Requiem? Not anymore.<br /><br />Then on Sunday, I read a review of a Simon Rattle performance of the piece in Berlin, and I got a hankering to hear it once again, even though the review was hardly glowing. I went to the shelves where a recording was nowhere to be found (obviously, I had forgotten that I had culled the piece entirely from my collection a few years ago). Went to amazon and found this latest repackaging of the 24/96 mastering for a mere $14.75 - and, it included rehearsal excerpts from the original recording session. I ordered this set on Monday, had it in my hands Tuesday (today).<br /><br />I took down my full orchestra score, lit up the discs and sat back...only to be disappointed once again. Only this time it wasn't just the piece. It was the remastered sound as well, which was bass-shy, a bit brittle and, well, foggy. Not at all what I remember from previous issues of this set that I've owned. I always considered this to be a demonstration-quality recording. My opinion has now changed - it isn't.<br /><br />As far as the performance, it's basically what I remember. There are a few early entrances in the chorus in the 7/4 sections that weren't so noticeable before. Messy ensemble in the orchestra is also fully on display. Very noticeable is the fact that of the vocal soloists, only Galina Vishnevskaya actually sings all of the written notes. Fi-Di and Pears fake their way through any number of spots. That, or their pitch is so indistinct as to make one aware that they are only approximating some of the written notes. Hearing this recording again reminded me why I so dislike most of Peter Pears singing - his strangulated vocalism is painful to hear, and it's REALLY strangulated here.<br /><br />So, hard to recommend this recording because I have a hard time recommending the piece itself.<br /><br />Britten's absolute masterpiece remains his opera \\"Peter Grimes.\\" Were that the only piece of substance he had written, he'd still be considered a great composer. As to the \\"War Requiem,\\" while it's not quite on the kitsch level of Bernstein's \\"Mass,\\" it's a lot closer to that than it is to the B-minor Mass.<br /><br />Three stars.<br /><br />On edit - 8/2/13: I see that Decca has remastered this recording yet again, and will be releasing it as a 2-CD, 1 BluRay Audio set on August 12 in \\"HD 24-bit sound.\\" Perhaps that issue will address the problems with the sound I have noted in this review.ng again reminded me why I so dislike most of Peter Pears singing - his strangulated vocalism is painful to hear, and it's REALLY strangulated here.<br /><br />So, hard to recommend this recording because I have a hard time recommending the piece itself.<br /><br />Britten's absolute masterpiece remains his opera \\"Peter Grimes.\\" Were that the only piece of substance he had written, he'd still be considered a great composer.

0385342071|5.0|My first audio-book experience: highly entertaining and not too demanding to keep up with in the car. Since so much of the plot is based on phone calls and text messages, less experienced authors might struggle to keep things moving, but Kinsella pulled it off well. The wedding scene was perhaps a little improbable, but that's all part of the fun in this genre. Poppy was a fun heroine to follow.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved all the stories of each character and how they were all intertwined, from the very beginning it was hard to put it down, wanting to know what was next. I found if I didn't keep reading and left it for a couple of days l had to go back and review , it was easy to get a little lost, but as the story unfolds and comes to the end you see it all unfold, such a sweet and also sad ending. I have read all of Hosseini,s books and have loved them all.

0060899220|4.0|I enjoyed this book and learned a lot about the restaurant business.  IN fact, I learned enough to make me never want to follow my dream of owning my own restaurant.<br /><br />Tony Bourdain is funny enough and a pretty decent writer, but his snark and NY attitude put me off a lot.  Some may find that entertaining.  Overall, a good book to discuss in a book club.
B0087ITBPC|1.0|Ok, first of all I thought this movie was a comedy based on the trailer. It is not so be warned. This is 100 percent drama with only 2 or 3 brief funny moments. It isn't even a good drama. I found the movie to be both depressing and boring. They could have done so much more with this movie.

B008QE9XD2|1.0|Surely no director with so much talent has wasted it on the drivel Tim Burton has.  For the past ten or so years he has done everything in his limited power to demonstrate his total lack of imagination.  Yes.  The man noted for his unorthodox style hasn't the imagination to make a movie unmarred by lack of structure, by characters who are hopelessly one dimensional, by stories that are absurd in the pejorative sense of the word (rather than the Beckettian sense).  The only film he has made that might be considered great is \\"Ed Wood\\" which is ironic as Burton may soon be closely identified with that talentless hack.  His \\"Alice\\" film was an insult leveled against not only Lewis Carroll's fertile imagination, but also of every child who wondered at the story of Alice's adventures.<br />\\"Dark Shadows\\" is a abortive remake of \\"Beetlejuice\\" and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\".  You'd think by now Burton would have made more than one film that might join the ranks of his contemporaries such as Tarentino, the Coen Brothers, or Wes Anderson to name a few.  The Coens' also are stylists, but not at the expense of substance.  They mine every genre for all they're worth, sometimes mixing them superbly as in their masterpieces \\"Raising Arizona\\" and \\"Fargo\\".  Burton simply has nothing to say cinematically (or any other way for that matter) in this he is akin to Depalma who has never had an original thought, cinematic or otherwise, instead preferring to wallow in interring ideas that worked when he was still cutting his teeth.  Burton's once lauded \\"Batman\\" films are horribly dated.  Style alone can take one only so far - one gets the feeling he has no feeling for the craft to which he has devoted his life.  Sample dialogue: \\"I'm a werewolf.  Deal with it.\\"  And it boasts a montage while Karen Carpenter warbles \\"Top of The World\\"Avoid this film.  It is as empty, as heartless, as soulless, as bereft of intelligence as a turtle's shell without the turtle.

B00BTHWFBK|4.0|The true measure of greatness originates in something that music has lost - originality. It's difficult to be original in 2013. When Buddy Holly used drums for the first time on a recording it was groundbreaking. You can argue that the first mosh pit formed when Jerry Lee Lewis played his piano like Dave Lombardo of Slayer plays drums. That was around 60 years ago, and since that time many genres of music have come and gone only to be brought back to life. 43 years after \\"Paranoid\\" was released, Sabbath has a #1 album on the UK charts. Call it nostalgia, call it luck, call it Ozzy's popularity. Whatever you call it, it's nothing short of a miracle.<br /><br />\\"13\\" was an album in the making for perhaps the past 13 years. The obstacles to actually getting the boys into a studio at the same time have been well-documented; contract disputes, Ozzy's reality TV show, Iommi's cancer just to name a few. What amazes is that the result is an astounding tribute to what Black Sabbath has always been about. They are able to create music that has a basis in blues and jazz while making it sound as original as original is these days. Sabbath's first album was truly groundbreaking, and 43 years later they managed to remain above the fray and put out something of quality.<br /><br />The 8 songs on the album are pieced together perfectly. The art of song sequence lives with this release. Bonus tracks are just that...tracks that didn't make the album for one reason or another. That being said, the bonus tracks are better then most album tracks out there now. However, the album itself is near-perfection. The songs are epic. In a word, they are \\"Sabbath.\\" Iommi's signature is all over this. You get the feeling that if he was able to, he'd put out an album that has two 25 minutes songs on it. The transitions, bridges, time changes, and tempo shifts make the album feel like it has 12 tracks. Iommi did some of this on his solo effort \\"Fused.\\" I thought that album was one of the best of thedecade, and of course like most things Tony Iommi does, it fell under the radar.<br /><br />Geezer's bass sounds like a repetitive anvil bouncing off of Iommi's riffs. You raraely get bassists who shread; that's not the case with Butler. It's a unique way of playing and serves as the undertone and foundation for everything Sabbath does. Bill Ward is missed, but Wilk does a good job keeping to the swing and move tempos that Ward would have provided.<br /><br />When you consider the available music today, it's hard to imagine that 3 senior citizens can put something this solid into the marketplace when the winner of \\"American Idol\\" is what's considered the next best artist. I hope this isn't the final chapter for Sabbath, but if it is what a way to go out.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I have been interested in tryin this show out for awhile and ended up watching the first 2 seasons in a 24 hour period!
B004ZN9OTG|5.0|What more can I say? It is not DSOTM but is an important period of transition between the Syd Barrett years and what we nw know as Pink Floyd. A very good album as is Ummagumma which was part f this order along with Booker T. and the MGs &#34;Green Onions&#34;. I include this info because though the albums are great, Amazon's packaging is in the toilet. I got &#34;free super saver shipping&#34; Amazon threw the two PF CDs in a 7.5&#34;x10&#34;x2&#34; cardboard box with absolutely NO packing material. Since the CDs were packaged in paper cases rather than the old &#34;jewel&#34; cases they arrived bashed in on the corners and one had a nick in the cover. When i buy something NEW I expect it to arrive in NEW condition. If Amazon continues to just throw new CDs in a box with no packing material I will not be buying from them. I am very disappointed with this. I am going to keep them but be aware, if you care about how your CDs look... make sure and tell Amazon to package your shipment properly. If this had been LPs I would be returning them. Anyway... the music is good.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|We love Dixit, but we wound up needing more cards nearly immediately. Dixit 2 fits that need perfectly, and even better, given that this doesn't come with a board/etc, it adds-on to the other Dixit games very well. What's more, we found that this is a perfect travel pack, being compact, with just the cards, so that when we're traveling, we can use pen and paper to substitute for all the other game elements, and with just the cards, we're good to go.<br /><br />If you already have one of the other dixit games, and need an expack, this is the one to go for.<br />If you have a large boardgame collection, where cupboard space is at a premium, and do not have any of the other dixit games, but have played it with others and are okay with using pen&paper to track points and the guesses, this is still a great first dixit to get.
B00AH8FTT2|4.0|I like the author. It is along time since Clifton two but it was OK.<br />I do not like reviews
B00CISC2DA|3.0|I'm very confused by this album. I have no idea where you would listen to it. It's not something you can dance to, it's not something you can listen to while driving a car at night on a deserted road. It's just dull. It doesn't seem to have a spirit or convey any emotions. Maybe if you're a fan you'll give it 5 stars. But I don't think it's something for a casual listener, or for someone who wants an introduction to the band.
B00D5RJTQ6|5.0|Love this release, can't wait to hear FIR playing the new songs live. it is catchy, and slightly different. even Charlie gets to be in a song!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have enjoyed every episode very much. It is the best I have seen in years. Buy all three seasons now!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Stella is so week.I also like angry bird toons.you should get this game you will like it a lot by
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Enjoys this last book by Blake CROUCH. SOME TIMES IT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING BUT IT JUST MADE YOU KEEP READING.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The DVD came in time, it was very well protected, came with no harm, and it's a great product, I recommend this product to everyone.
B00CFSWMYM|2.0|If you want to buy this album, make sure you listen to the clips first! Things have changed.<br /><br />First off, the song \\"Home\\" which I love and they're promoting this album with, is not representative. The other songs don't have the same level of drama and don't showcase the vocals as much. Something has happened between her first (amazing) album and this one. Elements have been added to the music, but they aren't helping. They're turning exceptional music into generic music.<br /><br />Some of the professional reviews I've read have been praising the new techniques Austra has been using. She's collaborating with people, there's live music. But I wish she would ditch her collaborators. I think they're holding her back and this album would have been better without them.
034554398X|5.0|\\"A Storm of Swords\\" continues the epic fantasy series of George R.R. Martin.  Book 3 of a planned 7 volume series, this novel definitely keeps the moving parts of the Westeros Kingdom rolling along.  Coming in at almost 1200 pages, this book continues the storylines of the War of the 5 Kings, the Wall and above it, and the Dragon princess in the Eastern Kingdom.  The book begins with events around the Battle of Blackwater, and the ensuing fallout of that victory by King Joffrey.  Martin covers all areas of the map with viewpoints from Catelyn, Arya, Jon Snow, Jaime and Tyrion Lannister, Sam, and a few more.  From each character's viewpoint, we see the events unfold of hard fought battles to new and unexpected weddings, to the inner workings of the King's and their staff and bannermen.<br /><br />  Besides the human characters of the series, Martin also has many non-human's that affect the various storylines.  With Dragons, Wights, Dire Wolves, Mammoths, and the dreaded Others, there are many creatures that are either assisting or terrifying our characters.<br /><br />  For fans of Martin, this book does not disappoint.  It was an engrossing read, and the final third of the book is very difficult to put down.  The only thing I was a bit disappointed in, was some of the typos I found.  Regardless, this book was awesome, and I look forwards to reading book 4, \\"A Feast For Crows\\".
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very entertaining. The best show I have seen in years! I highly recommend buying all three seasons! You will not be disappointed.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game.Who ever says bla bla I uptadeted it and I had to start all over.Ignore them it would be fun starting all over again because there's not that much levels.People go crying to there mom about.  a GAME.Its very fun!Enjoy the game!:-)
B006P96PAO|4.0|I liked there only movie to hit the big screen, but i have seen them all. Its not some fancy big budget film but a good moral movie.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Story was bland as was the acting. Too much hype about dance routines and &#34;hot&#34; male bodies that didn't amount to anything you don't see in a TV commercial. Save your coins.
B00C6XBESQ|5.0|This is a great album with great music. French pop trends to be hokey, but Zaz works with that without going there. It helps that she's a talented vocalist.<br /><br />The album is light and fun, but always seems tasteful. There's a lot of variety in the songs, and even though I don't speak French I was still able to enjoy them. (Zaz can easily convey emotions with her voice over a language barrier.) Many of the songs have an intimate feeling, and listening to this music is like sitting at a live performance.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially if you need something to brighten your day.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game always works and is fast paced. I never buy anything i just stay patient and come back the next day for free coins.
B004LROUNG|5.0|The Litigators was a great read.  The book had a great storyline, the characters came alive plus the introduction to the drug business and mass torts was very interesting. Thank you,<br />John Grisham!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this!whoever said blablabla it wont open their just rating their tablet not the app because its the tablets falt.Its fun you get to make red bird eat lollipops and make the pigs get the eggs and you get to cook them while red bird is lazy eating potato chips in front of the TV.Red bird got a award for taking a piggie in his car to mcdonalds redbird paid for his burger and got 5000 points cool game! I also recommend you to eat your vegatables at dinner meat eaters!:-)

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My grandson likes to play this ... by watching him,  I am not too keen on the movements of the game.

B002ECN4P0|5.0|If you like the rolling stones or just care to listen to some of there music, you will like this album.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I'm not going to tell you much about the plot of Neil Gaiman's latest, The Ocean at the End of the Lane.  It's a slender book, under 200 pages, and his first novel for adults in eight years.  Here, however, is a brief exchange that happens early in the tale:<br /><br />*****<br />She shrugged.  \\"Once you've been around for a bit, you get to know stuff.\\"<br />I kicked a stone.  \\"By `a bit' do you mean `a really long time'?\\"<br />She nodded.<br />\\"How old are you really?\\" I asked.<br />\\"Eleven.\\"<br />I thought for a bit.  Then I asked, \\"How long have you been eleven for?\\"<br />She smiled at me.<br />*****<br /><br />That exchange occurs between the unnamed seven-year-old narrator and his new friend, Lettie Hempstock.  However, we first meet this narrator about 40 years later in the novel's prologue.  He's returned to the rural English village of his youth to attend a funeral.  After the service, he takes a drive and finds himself strolling down not only the lane of his childhood home, but down memory lane as well.  And what this visit unearths are some long-suppressed memories of extraordinary events.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman has been candid in admitting that the bookish protagonist of the tale is a stand-in for his younger self, and that the novel has autobiographical elements--though I think it will be clear that they are merely a jumping off point for the fantastic.  And fantastic it is!  In all senses of the word.<br /><br />I read The Ocean at the End of the Lane on Father's Day, which somehow felt appropriate.  And I read it travel-woozy and jet-lagged.  Also good, I think.  I was halfway into another world already.  What I can tell you is this:  I read the book in one sitting.  I did not eat, drink, or take a bathroom break.  I did not move.  It's possible I did not breathe.  But I did get chills.  The book opens with what I gather was a true incident from the author's childhood, a tragedy that is the catalyst for all that is the come.  And as the tale grew darker and darker, I began to truly fear for these characters Gaiman had brought to life and made me care about.<br /><br />The story is a heady combination of fantasy, horror, nostalgia, and coming-of-age tale.  Like all of Mr. Gaiman's work, there is much subtext to be mined.  One could discuss the fascinating Hempstock women at length--their mythic origins, the various legends and cultures from which they may have derived, and their relationship to other Hempstocks in the author's catalog.  Or, you could concentrate on how the author examines adulthood from a child's perspective and childhood from an adult's perspective.  Or, you could identify the influences of numerous other writers on this work, and explore the importance of literature in our lives and the power of story within the tale.  The narrator asks, \\"Why didn't adults want to read about Narnia, about secret islands and smugglers and dangerous fairies?\\"  (Some of us do, Neil, some of us do.)  What I'm saying is, that while The Ocean at the End of the Lane may be short on page count, it's quite long on substance.<br /><br />The writing is evocative, eerie, and very, very good.  Dialogue and dialect bring characters' voices to life.  (\\"Right, my proud beauties,\\" said Ginnie Hempstock, loudly.)  The tale moves quickly.  At that length, there is nothing superfluous.  More than anything, Mr. Gaiman is a masterful story-teller.  When he tells you, in the guise of a pre-adolescent old soul, that a duck pond is an ocean, well, you WILL believe it.and darker, I began to truly fear for these characters Gaiman had brought to life and made me care about.<br /><br />The story is a heady combination of fantasy, horror, nostalgia, and coming-of-age tale.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The second read in this trilogy is a no nonsense, fast paced thrill ride that you can't put down. Although I generally don't like books written in the first tense, for this series I am making an exception.
1483934772|5.0|I normally wouldn't read this style of book, but I'm a great believer in getting out of comfort genre and reading new books. This is terrifically written for starters, and growing up I had an interest in Native American culture so I found this quite good,reminding me of my youth with stacks of books on Crazy Horse and Chief Joseph. I was intrigued by the use of native mythology and medicine(Shaman). After completing the book I went and looked up the tribe, their myths, land and lives. If a book that is fantasy can also be grounded in reality enough to lead the reader to further educate themselves I think its marvelous!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I was really excited to get this app untill I clicked install....&quot;sorry, could not process your download.&quot; meaning that its basicly not compatible! I'm pretty sure I have a kindle fire right?!
B00AEFXOWC|5.0|Very good movie,, kept me at the T.V. I do like a bit of action, which this had plenty. Thanks.
B00006EXDM|5.0|Good assortment of the Rolling Stones music. If you like the Rolling Stones or just like some good music this is a good buy.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book as much for the mystery and suspense as for the incredible amount of dog training information.  I hope there will be more of this series to come.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It's poor made ,thier no thing that tells u how everything works,players suck hard sometimes u should off die But keep on going.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|When my husband first got this game, I laughed at him.  But then I started to play it, and quickly was running down the battery.  We even got it for the PS3.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Good game.  You have to be patient to play.  They try and get you to buy things to speed up play.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love drawing. It's one of my favorite hobbies. But, I always needed inspiration. The dress styles are ADORABLE. Hair styles olare gorgeouse and I've had so much inapiration llaying this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Hidden objects plus puzzles equals hours of entertainment. The game challenges player to solve puzzles by finding objects and codes to open doors to find more objects or codes to find key to open elevator doors and escape the floor. Lots of fun!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A liberating refreshing book about spirituality and what it means to live, really live your life. An essential book if you have any kind of doubts as to how to keep going and what is really important when comes down to decision making, excellent book.
0670023329|5.0|I heard about this book on Fresh Air on NPR one evening and immediately went home to order.  It's an amazing story of struggle and an interesting look into the psychology of an internment camp survivor.  You may read the whole thing in one sitting.  Hard to put down.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It's not long before the reader realizes where the story is going.  And what a terrible resolution to the problem.  I think the author got lost somewhere along the way.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie and it's great that it includes both regular DVD and Blueray so we can play on any of our electronics.
B000YDI9UG|5.0|My husband loves these boots. They are casual but nice enough to wear with a pair of cargo pants. They fit well along with nice leather.
B00CA9Y6Q8|4.0|This is an amazing album that I am so glad Amazon carried.  I was able to download it the same day that it was released and I am so glad to have stumbled upon her as an artist.  A very soulful artist and similar in sound to Adele with a few differnt styles of songs.<br /><br />I look forward to more of her albums in the future.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Bought this for my man for his birthday. He was too thrilled. He loved all the extra stuff it came with also. Good deal
B00AVF8USS|4.0|Story line is ok. Interesting how media likes to portray military always trying to start a fight no matter the cost. This part goes too far.  Special effects and creativity of the native people is excellent.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I grew up watching Star Trek on television (off and on) and I even saw some of the motion pictures. However, I am actually a big fan of Star Wars, as I was just 7 years old when I saw it on the big screen. I saw Star Trek Into Darkness in 3D and I just loved it so much that I turned around the next week and saw it again. This now leads me to the first Star Trek - this is a great movie and one you have to watch before seeing the current movie. Some parts of the story make more sense if you watch this movie first before seeing Into Darkness. I mainly saw this for Spock because I have always liked watching Leonard Nimoy play the role as Spock and I did not think anyone could match up to the role as well as Zachary Quinto did in the current movies. Zachary's role as Spock was spot on! If you are a fan of Star Wars and like a lot of action packed excitement, then you won't be disappointed with this movie or the next one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|all I can say is it works...... it does its job and it works. If I said anything more, well i'd have to say it works.
B0080M3OGW|4.0|It's a fun pic. Great acting, but a formulaic plot. If you're a budding film critic, pass. If you just want to enjoy a movie, watch.
B00973902K|5.0|Loved it the first time I heard it, and I still love it!  I'm glad to be able to get music on my Kindle!
B00271DNP4|5.0|In my opinion POA is the best of the bunch.  Waiting until all the &#34;new&#34; editions of the movies stop coming before I buy.  When I do, this will be the first one I purchase.
020530902X|5.0|This review must be at least twenty words.  Strunk and White would have argued that a writer can convey their point in fewer words.  This is the minimalist writer’s bible.  It covers grammar in a simple, direct, and authoritative approach.  A must read for everyone who enjoys the craft of language.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|/<br />had a great time going through the mazes. cant wait to play the next one.  daughter would enjoy this game also.
0062255657|4.0|Gaiman is known and loved for his writings on the topics of magic, myth, and fantasy. Ocean completely touches on all of those topics. Originally, this idea started out a short story that Gaiman was writing, but turned out so well rounded and filled out that it had to be made into a short book, in lieu of cutting top quality material. Ocean is a fun book to read, but at times it can drag on. Considering it started as a short story and evolved into a short novel, some details throughout the book might come off as unnecessary. Most of the action and plot movement happens in the first 100 pages, with the remaining 80 picking up only trivial details that could have been closed out in fewer pages.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a novel for all ages, despite being targeted mostly at young adults. Throughout the book, the reader will encounter a story about love, loss, death and frightening situations; all emotions that readers of many levels can relate to. Fans of Gaiman's previous works like American Gods and Coraline will enjoy the level of mystic fantasy that he injects into the story, while new fans might just find themselves a new favorite author with his fresh, invigorating storytelling.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was a very creative game that made you think. I enjoyed playing it!! cant wait for more unlocked levels..:)
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|The term &#34;family movie&#34; gets slapped on a lot of junk, but this is really a movie the entire family can enjoy.
B000065V42|5.0|I started buying movies that were related to childhood memories.  This is definitely one of them.  It is a little corny, but it is better than watching negative and R rated movies.  I love it!  I would saw this is a movie that teaches a great moral!  Happy Watching!!! Great price too!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have a Kindle with keyboard,  wi-fi and 3g which is the best e-reader one can own. I had to reorder another cord as my original just seemed to not charge the unit. It was always questionable and came suddenly. I am very careful handling the cord but things happen. The cord is price  very inexpensive and works top notch. My Kindle is the same. I have owned it 14 months and the battery life is fantastic- lasts over a week or more with heavy reading. I bought the extended warranty. This is a quality cord and glad to know where I can purchase these type of products with Amazons name on them. I will know I will get a good quality product.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|I ordered this DVD as a used disk.  Watched it with grandchildren and it was like a new DVD.  Very pleased, will order from this place again.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Must keep track but overall a very pleasant journey through time and space...too bad we can't all travel like that....forever a classic!
B00181JGI2|5.0|One of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I originally saw it when we were both a bit younger, but it still holds up. AND - I also figured out how it got it's cult following: what is NOT cool about a guy in his fourties, living like he's fifteen? AND - he's getting away with it! (This is why girls hate it!)
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This item is a little pricey condisering the size of the product.  However, the delight on my sons face when he opened it was worth every penny!!
B00000JPH6|4.0|Disc seemed to be used, when I ordered a new one.  Came with the shrink wrap.  Just good condition. Great movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|very good fun love it makes me think just so fun and awesome I play It all the time amazing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very fun. But, there is one bad thing :( NOTHING!!! :) I recommend this to all people who have androids, phones, etc
B007IXWL2C|3.0|A fun read but nothing outstanding about the story line. I have never liked the character of Ana. As much as James tries to force feed her strength to you, she is anything but. Christian on the other hand is outstanding. What woman doesn't enjoy a dominant headstrong sexy man?
1451695195|3.0|Interesting book though I felt that many points were rehashed and just added to the length of the book unnecessarily.
B003VWU2WA|2.0|Don't recommend to use with PC.<br /><br />Device regualry disconnects (3-4 times a week), turnes on again only with plugging out and in again.<br /><br />Use device mainly for Windows volume altering. Native software is of a very poor quality and capabilities. Altering is too abrupt, no on-screen display for volume. Soft is just very-very old and now new versions were issued from 2010.<br /><br />Must mention a good craftsmanship of the device, though if I were a designer I wold add a notch for fingertip on the top.<br />Good-looking too.  Added 1 star for this.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Who knew I would like classical music, but I do.  I love listening to these Guys everyday.  I workout to them.  I relax to them.  There music is worth buying!!!  I listen to them more than my regular playlist of music.
B00BESCJII|5.0|One of our new favorite movies. We've watched it a few times and love it every time. Great soundtrack as well!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|wasn't opening after i played it about two times on my kfhd so i shut it down and since it came back on its been great!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a sequel and everyone of these books are so good it keeps you wanting more. Sylvia Day has you wanting to find a Gideon in your life.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|Kanye West has set a new bar with this Versitile Hiphop album. From start to finish every song is quality. I thought J. coles Album was a hiphop classic until I heard this album Yeezus and it's just on another level, the production, the raps the arrangements. If you are a fan of good music you are gonna love this album.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Last week I use this to give my first group meeting talk of my research. It works so well during the whole time.
B0049IHX2C|2.0|I love the Men in Black movies.  I was disappointed in this one.  The only thing I liked about this movie was that Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones starred in it. They make a great team! Again, I ordered a new disc and got a used one, yet playable.
B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|If you like action adventure movies or comic books this has the best of both.<br />Great actors, effects, cool story line and really cool weapons.<br /><br />I really hope they do a sequel to this. To good of an idea to let it not be explored.<br />The directors and producers should be really proud of this movie.
B004LROUNG|4.0|A fun quick read, slightly different format than other Grisham law thrillers. I enjoyed the characters and read it in three sittings. Grisham seems to enjoy people as they are, flaws and all, and celebrate the carnival of life.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder.  This was truly a wonderful book. It was heartwarming and such a great experience with all the characters.  I would recommend this one to all ages.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|If you like action then this is a movie for you! you never get tired of this movie, its got a really good cast in it.
0679805273|5.0|Read this to my high school students in their last class before graduation. One of my students used a quote from it in her graduation speech. Very fun book for all ages!
B000W4D94I|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  New disc!  Great price for blu-ray.  I love Hellen Hunt and a lot of the actors in this movie.  Blu-ray really is better.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|More general advice but really focused on management theory, which I liked although my entire background is in software engineering.  Great lis of resources in chapter 14
B001IYCMNA|5.0|This wireless access point is an N-Type, and is backward compatible to a, b and g.  Following the instructions should be easy enough for the average person that has a home or small business network to setup and integrate this unit into your network.  I have this setup in my home and have excellent coverage throughout the home, and slightly beyond.  It's always a good idea to setup a security code for accessing your wireless devices such as: laptop computer, TV, iPhone, iPad, etc., so as to insure that unknown others don't access your internet capabilities and personal network.

184661578X|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2NY5BJV8II20K]]TO THE IMPORTANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />The all too recent scandals and upheavals in the financial services sector -- like LIPBOR and PPI -- and others too numerous to mention here -- have had a profound effect on the economy too complicated to mention here either.  Suffice to say, changes had to be made, of which all financial and legal practitioners should be aware.  So thank you to Jordan Publishing for bringing out, as one of their most recent titles, `Modern Financial Regulation.'<br /><br />This timely first edition comprehensively covers and explains the changes in the regulation of financial services brought about by the Financial Services Act 2012.  The best known is of course, the replacement of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, a development which seems to have resulted in a more robust regime of regulatory, civil injunctive and criminal enforcement.<br /><br />`The Financial Services Act,' say the authors, `ushers in fundamental structural change, a modern era in financial regulation.'  It replaces, one hopes, the former and obviously ineffectual `light touch regulation' with `greater intervention, enforcement and sanction for the banking and financial services sector.<br /><br />The book is actually a collective work which brings together the insights of a number of expert contributors and authors, with the intention of providing a precise guide to the structural and regulatory changes that have taken place and the institutions that have been recently created.<br /><br />Over 11 chapters, the book discusses clearly and in detail the ways in which the Financial Services Act 2012 has affected other areas of financial regulation, from consumer credit and hire, to payment services, to money laundering, to electronic money and market abuse, as well as insider trading and cartels.<br /><br />Over half the book, however, is taken up quite rightly by the two appendices which include the Financial Services Act itself, reproduced in all its majesty and might in almost 320 pages, plus the three statutory instruments pertaining to the Act in Appendix Two.<br /><br />Produced in handy paperback format, the book is therefore a convenient research resource and reference book, as well as a practitioner's guide to the current regulatory landscape which affects the financial services sector.  Also note, for example, the extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and European materials.  And for enhanced ease of use, there is a minutely detailed table of contents and useful index at the back.<br /><br />If you are involved in any way with the financial services sector -- and most people in the City of London are -- you will definitely need a copy of this important new title.  The law is stated as at 26 February 2013.arket abuse, as well as insider trading and cartels.<br /><br />Over half the book, however, is taken up quite rightly by the two appendices which include the Financial Services Act itself, reproduced in all its majesty and might in almost 320 pages, plus the three statutory instruments pertaining to the Act in Appendix Two.<br /><br />Produced in handy paperback format, the book is therefore a convenient research resource and reference book, as well as a practitioner's guide to the current regulatory landscape which affects the financial services sector.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This book had me turning page after page. It was absolutely addictive. I infiltrate it four stars because there was some explicit content on a few pages. It didn't bother me, but others it could possibly offend. Overall, this is one of the best books I've read in a while and would definitely recommend it.
B00C7D3TRO|5.0|Fall out Boy comes through again With another great non stop album. The songs deliver a classic fob feel and leaves you wanting nothing.

B009AMANBA|5.0|GOOD MOVIE. I WANTED TO GO THE MOVIES TO WATCH LINCOLN BUT I NEVER DID.  GOOD CONDITION ALSO.  THE LIBRARY DID NOT HAVE IT. COULDN'T KEEP IT LONG ANYWAYS.  LOVE SHOPPING WITH AMAZON ITEMS ARE ALWAYS GOOD.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Harry Potter is such a wonderful story.  I still find myself watching it and loving every minute of it.  This 8 disc collection has a large amount of extras for each movie.  The price was also worth buying.  I paid a little under $50.  Brand-new and each movie in super great condition.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|l absolutely love it! gets your mind to really think but not to hard. i can't wait for more levels
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Thank God for those who use their voice to speak for the voiceless.  I absolutely loved this book.  A triumph.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Its a good app but the videos load way too slow and it buffers every three seconds. Needs speed improvements.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|Not that fun, push notifications that won't shut up, ads, and when you reach level 4, the next time you exit, you'll be back to level 3 and loose anything you did. Really annoying and not a good app all in all. And there are a HUGE amount of in-app purchases that like to pop up and annoy you.
1780721676|5.0|I've seen Dr Mosley's special on PBS and decided to read his book. The program is flexible and be followed easily.  I would recommend this book to all people interested in controlling their weight and staying healthy.  Joe Rabidoux
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Do you enjoy Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Billie Holiday, Elis Regina, or Dinah Washington? Me too. If you're like me, you will adore Cécile McLorin Salvant. She is the most important female Jazz vocalist to emerge in the past 40 years, in my estimation. I am so impressed with her challenging and risque song selections on this album: very bold. Her technical abilities are unparalleled. Her backing band is also top notch. I will be following her career with much interest!
1401941893|5.0|I read this book from cover to cover.  You can feel how beautiful Miranda is from the inside.  If everyone in the world had her outlook on life, this world would be a better place.
B005PWPUW6|2.0|Sturdily built, and functions how it is advertised.  I use it to create a dual-output from my HTPC.  No complaints from me.<br /><br />UPDATE:  2 years later, and it only outputs out of one channel now.  Food for thought.
B003TOMAPC|3.0|f you are shocked by swearing children then don't watch it. This little girl says things even a modern woman may not be willing to say in public
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|I chose this rating because it was not entirely how it was described on its description, the very last disc of the season was very scratched when it arrived and would not play most of it! I did not like what I had received because of that reason. I would recommend this product to no one in the condition it was in, but if taken care of this is a wonderful product
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|fun game just like on FB syncs up nicely to the phone and it's a great time killer! Fun for all ages!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|If you like Lee Child's books, you will like this movie. May be Tom Cruise's best movie that he has been part of to date.

B0000A5BTV|1.0|I LOVE this story and was sooooo looking forward to watching with my husband and adult daughters. ... however the dvd would not play in either of our machines:-(  don't want to have to buy another, but i might. Very disappointed! ! Seller should have made sure dvd would pay. Its used and scratched the disk. That's the reason for 1 star.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I would recommend this book to any kids that like to read or have read other diary of a wimpy kid books.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Purchased it and wasted a dollar.  Apparently waited too long to try out the game and realize it doesn't work on my phone - so no option to return it.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Very nice game for a freebie. Would love to see some ww2 bomber style game in the future.  Get it, you won't be disappointed.

B00AEFY5TI|5.0|the movie of the hit broadway show which cemented John Travolta as a bankable star also stars Jeff Conaway Stockard Channing and Olivia Newton John
B00ARIO7PO|2.0|Mike Oldfield is a genius, even if he never produces another high quality piece of work.  This is not a high quality piece of work.  The first and last tunes are good, but the rest just sound like outtakes from The Millennium Bell, or rather, they all sound like the same outtake.  I've bought everything he's ever recorded ... and then I quietly got rid of both Amarok and The Killing Fields.  This one will end up being jettisoned, too.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|Sooooo good! Emma Thompson's performance when her sister was about to die had me sobbing too! Grippingly good portrayal of the this classic book.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The story of the shepherd boy who follows his dream is written in a deceptively simple style. For It contains spiritual insights upon which the reader can ponder long after finishing the tale. A buoyantly satisfying book.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I love this case! It shows off all the beautiful features of the iPhone 4 while protecting it in good, sturdy plastic.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|Well, at least now we have Strikeback and Homeland! I can't wait for the 24 movie that's on the way. 24 is a great series; season 8 is no exception.
0765342294|5.0|Captivating and interesting all at the same time. Definitely recommend this book to anyone to read throughout the summer days.
B000J4QWMC|5.0|I am watching the 80's re runs, but this is a great updated version. Great music, women, cars, and action.
B002APU580|2.0|The only redeeming thing about the this movie is the beauty of the pictures themselves. Keira Knightley is NOT a good Elizabeth. However they did get Jane right in this one compared to the A & E version. The story telling from the director was flawed and left much to be desired. No NO No.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|Kiedis does an amazing job keeping the reader entertained, and a big shout out to his writing, he is a gifted author.  I really loved getting some behind the scenes angles of the band's albums as well! Awesome read!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this book.  Very informative, interesting and funny.  Kept my interest with the awesome experiments.  It is very helpful in my day to day thinking process.  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Actually, I already have!
B0001MIQHQ|1.0|I'm not to happy with my experience with getting the right Region for this movie on DVD. When I ordered this from RAREWARES-IMPORTS I sent them an E-Mail asking if this was a Region 1 DVD because their details were vague and didn't include where they were located or anything about the DVD. I found out the hard way that they are located in Europe, the DVD was already sent and it was a Region 2. When I finally got the DVD, my daughter opened the package, I had to spend an extra $9.50 to send it back to them first class. When I was refunded, they only gave me back the money I spent on the DVD, $5.63 which didn't include the $3.99 S&H I paid in the first place. So as you can see, I'm not a happy camper about this incident.
0671027344|5.0|Captivating and interesting all at the same time. Definitely recommend this book to anyone to read throughout the summer days.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I give this 4 stars, but only because it has a lack of content compared to the pc version. Minecraft (pc) is my fav game and this is well worth the $7. I would recommend it to anyone that has a drop of creativity or survivor in them.
B008BM9L72|2.0|like most other over 40 women, i was looking for a little tantalizing soft porn, and although that part was good, the plot (well there wasn't really much of that) was boring and transparent.  not worth the money.  on another note i purchased the trilogy on my kindle and purchasing it was fun.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|It's a very fun game it seems to lag every once and a while other then that I would say it's a good game as far as a tablet or phone game.
B006FE83UE|4.0|DVD works well and arrived without any damage or problems.  It is exactly how it was described without any undesirable surprises.
160459201X|5.0|Hope my kids get as much out of this as I did. Great book for everyone.  Words are a little deep, but good read.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Wow, what an amazingly revealing read of a persons' need for something to believe in beyond themselves. The journey through is not so much the brutality that occurred,  but rather a how and why of those who did survive. Frankl then explains how these same styles of thinking perpetuate today and a feeling of meaningless can be transformed into hopefulness.
B002OSY2T6|5.0|I had this for my now 2 year old and it didn't survive being in the basement in storage and a move to a new home so I purchased a new one for my now 11 week old. He loves that he barely has to touch it and it makes sounds and he can look at himself in the mirror.
B000UX6THK|4.0|as i never actually saw this series when it was on tv, i surprised to see how well it had stood the test of time.<br />kyle mc is fantastic in it, and the journey to the killer is suburb.  good packaging also
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app. It will keep you entertained and u will never get board I highly recommend this app
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire, the second book of The Hunger Games, leaves you wanting to know what is next for Katniss. If there is no District 12, where is everyone or are they dead? What happens to Peers? I can hardly wait to start the next book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game because it is very challenging but fun! Its a a very very fun way to waist time... :)))))))
B003QTUQGU|5.0|Great movie, easy formate to download and watch it on, good picture quality, all that stuff.  I have not seen a Depp movie that I have not liked though, nor has my wife, so that makes us a bit bias in our review.  It is the only Alice in Wonderland that I really have enjoyed.  Actually, all of the other players in this movie did a super job too, well done end to end.  bravo.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a very addictive game. If you play it once you want to play it a thousand more times.It is also kid firendly. If you have a lot of time on your hands this is the game for you.
1427229201|4.0|good story...stars to get a little soapy towards the end.<br />But still good. He does write a very intriguing tale.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|It his game is about sec I let my 5 year old play with it because I didn't know she ask me what is that hot dog on tv
1601251556|4.0|It's a cheap dry erase mat with 1&#34; x 1&#34; squares that don't erase.  This is exactly as advertised and surprisingly helpful.  My only complaint is that it is folded into smaller rectangles and the creases never fully disappear (but if you put books over them and wait overnight, they flatten enough that they aren't any hindrance).
B0061PEAUY|4.0|It took a bit to adjust to the differences in characters between this book and the TV series, since I've been watching that for years. Once I got the TV expectations out of my mind, I very much enjoyed the characters and the story, and I plan to read more of Reich's' \\"Bones\\" books.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy this game it really helps puts your mind to test. please bring on more levels as I am almost done with the game already
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is great it was one of the first apps I ever got and I still play it!!!!!!!I think that everyone should get this game!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Its a challenging game,  but not so challenging that you want to quit before finishing. I enjoyed playing this game and recommend it if you have a few minutes to kill.
B000EXZI0A|5.0|Love the RAMONES, they were very professional when going on stage live, & yes, they were all strung out, but, once they got on stage live, it was an entirely different entity.<br />This is pure PUNK, nothing can match this or anything the RAMONES did.....<br />VELVET UNDER GROUND ALSO, BUT, I'M SERIOUSLY INTO 60'S, 70'S & VERY EARLY 80'S, 80'S BROUGHT UIS BIG HAIR BANDS, QUEEN WAS OVER, JOHN LENNON WAS ASASSINTED, THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR GOOD MUSIC.......ZEP, WAS OVER, JOHN BONHAM DIED, JIMMY PAGE WENT UNDER GROUND FOR 3 LONG YRS., .I SUPPOSE I JUST HAVEN'T MOVED ON FROM THE MID 80'S, GUNS N ROSE WAS GOOD, AXEL ROSE, WROTE SOME BEAUTIFUL SONGS, I COULD LIVE WITHOUT SLASH, SO, ZEPPELIN, JIMMY PAGE, CREAM, DERECK & THE DOMINPOS, SO ACDC, BLACK SABBATH, STILL TO THIS DAY, THERE IS NOT ONE BAND THAT CAN MATCH WHAT THESE GREAT, GREAT GUITARISTS DID......<br />JOE BONAMASO&lt; TE]DESCHI TRUCKS BAND, GOVT MULE, ALLMAN BROTHERS, CAN GO ON, BUT.....IF YOU LIKE PUNK,  THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM, LET'S NOT FORGET JOAN JET, PATTIE SMITH.....
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|I truly like this game, the graphic designing is by far one of the best I've ever seen, the only thing holding this back is a stable server connection, its hard to get a game but it's totally worth that wait, maybe an update will get things going, well done.
B003XQM2YU|1.0|I get so tired of the download problems.  We can never watch a movie our tv.  we have to watch it on our laptop.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Totally Addictive and FUN!!<br /><br />You can &#34;cheat&#34; and buy your way to a win, but it is so much fun just as it is I have yet to purchase any additional helps.<br /><br />Great game!
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I am a big Kanye West fan, of his music I mean, but even I found this album rather testing when I first listened to it. All the songs sounded alike; stark and minimal, or so I thought.<br /><br />Provocatively titled, with provocative lyrics to match, the sound is dark, jarring, minimal and heavy on auto-tune, somewhere between \\"808s & Heartbreak\\" and \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\", with a few tracks so skeletal, they border on the tuneless (\\"Send It Up\\").<br /><br />Opening the album is the sketchy \\"On Sight\\" (produced by Daft Punk) juxtaposes stabbing spare synths with a slowed down break. Also produced by Daft Punk is \\"Black Skinhead\\" which sets fuzzy effects to martial beats (which progressively get frenetic to match his delivery), the abrasive \\"I'm In\\" has Dancehall flourishes and a falsetto-sung chorus, and the stark \\"New Slaves\\" featuring Frank Ocean on harmonies, has a lovely guitar coda.<br /><br />My favourites are the haunting \\"Hold My Liquor\\" which features Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) and quietly trilling guitars, the Nina Simone-sampling \\"Blood On Leaves\\" (with a nice piano intro, and lyrics some will consider sacrilegious considering the subject matter of the sampled \\"Strange Fruit\\"), the sublime swirling \\"Guilt Trip\\" (featuring Kid Cudi), and \\"Bound 2\\" (featuring Charlie Wilson singing a hook, a nice retro-sounding Soul sample and the line \\"I know I got a bad reputation\\" which many will agree with).<br /><br />Simple yet complex, I'm sure fans of Hip Hop will be averse to this with its heavy Industrial/Rock/Trance leanings. Definitely requires repeated listening to fully embrace, and while not his best work (as is being over enthusiastically touted by numerous reviews), is an album that will be talked about for a long time. Kanye ups his game yet again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love games where you have to find the clues then put the pieces together! Fantastic game! Looking forward to future levels!
0062255657|5.0|There are times when being a grown-up is not all it's cracked up to be. When to be able to take a step out of time to go back in time would be a gift. To see where it all went wrong, or could have gone wrong. To remember.<br /><br />That's part of what happens in The Ocean at the End of the Lane, the first novel for adults that Neil Gaiman has written in several years. Whether classified as fantasy, fable, horror, or magic realism, the slim novel (which, really, is a novella at 178 pages) is a literary look back to a time the narrator doesn't seem to recall. And then he does.<br /><br />The middle-aged man, an unnamed narrator, takes a drive after a funeral in the part of England where he grew up. Seemingly without meaning to, he ends up at the end of the lane. It's where the Hempstock farm is. Where Old Mrs. Hempstock, her daughter Ginnie and her granddaughter Lettie lived. The place where, as a seven-year-old boy, the narrator nearly lost his world.<br /><br />He is a lonely child. The flashback that takes up most of the book begins with no one coming to his seventh birthday party. He doesn't feel all that bad about it because well, he's got something better. \\"Books were safer than other people anyway.\\"<br /><br />Fantastical things happen to the seven-year-old boy after he goes on a jaunt with Lettie, who seems to be about 11 years old. He tries to handle things himself but things soon get way out of hand. It takes the help of the Hempstocks to try to make the world right again after things come that should never have been let in. Sort of like when a child discovers things he believed in like Santa are not real, or things like his parents' marriage cannot last.<br /><br />The boy's reactions, and the way the grown-up man looks back at how he felt as a boy, make this a far more serious work than an entertainment with fantastical elements. When things first begin to go wrong, the boy doesn't even think of going to his parents, who he loves, for help. But he will need Lettie and Ginnie and Old Mrs. Hempstock.<br /><br />Gaiman uses his tools in The Ocean at the End of the Lane to tell a story that started with the real-life memory of a man who died in a car at the end of the lane where he grew up. The story has much in common with his brilliant children's novel, Coraline, in which the world is not always steady, creatures from older places want to come in to play and adults cannot be relied upon. Searching for home, or to make something else go home, are at the heart of both stories. And, like Murakami, there are trustworthy cats in both books. This story is one that won't be up for the Newbery children's literature award, which Gaiman won with The Graveyard Book (this is definitely a book for adults with horrific ideas about a father's power and weaknesses). But The Ocean at the End of the Lane should win everything it is eligible to win; it's that good.

B00CELB94E|4.0|Beady Eye's sophomore album \\"BE\\" beats their debut by miles, probably due to the Input of producer Dave Sitek (who is one of my favourites). He's introduced enough electronic flourishes and arrangements to make this interesting.<br /><br />Opening is the thumping horn-peppered Beatles-esque \\"Flick Of The Finger\\" ending with a theatrical quote by Kayvan Novak. This is followed by the soothing \\"Soul Love\\" with a woozy coda.<br /><br />\\"Face The Crowd\\" is a jangly rocker, while \\"Second Bite Of The Apple\\" is groovy and a killer, as is the bouncy \\"I'm Just Saying\\" which has an incredibly catchy riff.<br /><br />\\"Don't Brother Me\\" is a woozy ballad stretched to epic proportions at 7 minutes, with Liam Gallagher seemingly offering a half-hearted olive branch to his estranged sibling Noel, while the jagged \\"Shine A Light\\" reeks of The Rolling Stones. Closing the album are a pair of acoustic ballads; \\"Ballroom Figured\\" and \\"Start Anew\\". \\"We've got the whole world in our hands, go on take a chance, start anew\\" sings Liam on the latter, and they do.

B002361MLA|4.0|This book describes with imperessive clarity the problems we face as individuals -what we think of ourselves, our relationships, and the world.<br />Not so convincing is the solution presented: to surrender to &#34;what is&#34;, stop thinking all the time, and start living in the Now. Even when this was my initial feeling (a stretch-out solution), we should all try it, believe in it, and see what happens. Great book... Enjoy your way to enlightment!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Perfect condition (got it new), but it seems that Game of Thrones just keeps getting better and better! I'm not surpised that his is almost #1 (ranks #2) on IMDB.com!!!!! If you haven't seen this series yet, watch it! Its totally worth looking into. :)
B001AITH50|1.0|A good horror film should make your hair stand on end.  \\"Interview with a vampire\\" made my flesh crawl instead.  All those long lingering looks between the protagonists and the homoerotic subtext, made it unwatchable. If you want to see  good vampire movies, watch the old Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee films ,especially, \\"The Horror of Dracula\\". They were well directed, well acted, atmospheric, and at times, had that tragic element which characterize the best horror films.

0385342039|5.0|This is my 2nd Kinsella book.  I'm an official fan now. I absolutely fell in love with the Sadie character, and I loved how she turned pathetic little Laura into a strong capable woman.  The plot was interesting, gripping, funny, emotional and brilliant.  I haven't read another book like it.  Being a fan of ghosts, 1920's and learning family history, this was a slam dunk for me, but it wasn't all of that influencing that it was just well-written and entertaining.  I recommended it to my reading friends.  My only criticism, if you want to call it that, is that the climax of the story was a bit premature.  There was still a lot of wrapping-up that maybe wasn't necessary, but I'm still glad she did it.  Well done, Sophie!  Also, I listened to the audio version of it.  Rosalyn Landor did a fantastic job reading it.  Her voice of Sadie put a vision in my mind of Lady Mary of Downton Abbey.

B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann is as unique in his own way as Pavarotti. Not to make a comparison because there is none, but to reward uniqueness. The album is excellent collection of Wagner and more a celebration of the music as opposed to being just a showcase for vocal. Nobody has conveyed Wagner better than him in decades, and if you don't believe me, ask the renowned Renata Scotto (Youtube). There is a dark hollowness in Kaufmann's voice that I have not heard from anyone, It fit's these pieces like a glove. He is clearly not the typical top of the line tenor. I could imagine that Wagner would have appreciated the quality of his tone, and undoubtedly hired him immediately.

0307730700|5.0|I love to read military books. I recently read the memoirs of Major Dick Winters, leader of Easy Company during WWII. After reading that book I began looking for another great story of heroic courage in the face of great adversity, and I found it.<br /><br />Unlike the stories of WWII, where man faced great adversity in battle, Fearless by Eric Blehm tells the story of the adversity faced by one man, Adam Brown, long before he ever faced any adversity in battle, the adversity of life.<br /><br />The story of Adam Brown is an amazing story of mistakes made but grace found. It is a story that could be the story of many of us yet it doesn't end the way we might think it does. In fact, it ends quite differently, and Eric Blehm does a wonderful job telling it.<br /><br />From the crazy exploits of a high school athlete, like jumping from the interstate bridge from a moving vehicle in the dark, to the low points of finding himself in dilapidated crack houses, to some of the highest levels of the Navy SEAL teams, Fearless covers the life that Adam lived, and ultimately gave in the service of his country. But the story isn't found in the heroics of the night he lost his life, but it is found in the heroics of the daily choices he faced when all of life seemed to be against him. And the story is found in the people who loved Adam despite the failures and successes that made up his life.<br /><br />One soldier said of the writing, \\"You need to tell the whole story. There are enough books that show how tough SEAL training is, there's enough Tom Clancy fiction. What there isn't enough of is the humanity. When you start digging, you are going to find a whole lot of humanity in Adam Brown.\\" And that is what you will find in Fearless.<br /><br />I think Adam's life, and this book, can be summed up in a quote from Major Winters. When asked by his grandkids if he was a hero during the war he replied, \\"I wasn't a hero in the war, but I served in a company of heroes.\\" Adam Brown's life and story echo that statement. Read this book and you will learn so much more than what a SEAL does, but you will learn who Adam Brown is and what he left behind.<br /><br />I received this book from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for an honest review.
B0001I561E|5.0|I love this movie. It was my favorite movie as a child and now my daughter loves it as well.

1594487154|3.0|I am a big fan of Pink's earlier works. Drive is one of my all time favorites. With that said, To Sell is Human did not live up to my expectations and will make me seriously consider reading anything else he puts out. It felt like a compilation of his earlier publications and other books. I could not find the value of new information that I expect from a book, especially one from an author as well known as Pink.<br /><br />I agree with the underlying premise of the book that the world has shifted and we are all in sales type positions. What I expected from that viewpoint was reasons why it has shifted and how we can utilize our knowledge of the environment to better communicate with those around us.<br /><br />If you want the knowledge, listen to one of the podcasts or interviews he did to promote the book. It isn't worth your time to read it.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I came across this by accident, read the blurb and was fascinated. The book itself didn't disappoint in the slightest. Gladwell writes in a very engaging, readable manner. Fascinating topic...how does success occur? Where does it come from? With compelling research and intriguing stories, he makes a clear case for nurture over nature.<br /><br />Interested now to read some of his other works.

B00BRBIA6C|5.0|It was great to hear Agnetha singing again! Growing up I loved listening to ABBA, and Agnetha (the blond one) was the reason why. Amazingly, her voice sounds as good as it did back then, she doesn't disapoint. This is her first new material in almost 10 years, and at 63 now, this might be the last time she will record. The songs are all original, and will definetly tug at your heart strings. This CD is a must if you are a fan of Agnetha!

030759565X|5.0|I ordered the Smitten Kitchen Cookbook from Premier Book Dealers, Inc. located in Kingsport TN on a Friday Night and had this used book in the mail waiting for me after work on Monday! Premier is indeed a premier quality company...and this used book that was sent to me doesn't even appear to have been browsed through by anyone else's fingers.  They sent a letter with the book asking me to write a review of their services, but also asking to rectify any discrepancies and satisfy the order to my satisfaction.  There were no problems but it is great to know that this is a company that cares about their customers, especially in a world of indifference.
1451695195|3.0|This book is easily accessible for the non- or less-scientific reader. The author reviews other's near death experiences and relates them to his own NDE. As a neurosurgeon he analyses his own experience both in terms of the &#34;neurological realty&#34; but also as a human being (husband, father...) attempting to make sense of the nearly nonsensical. His interpretative schema is interesting but not necessarily persuasive; furthermore, his conclusion that he experienced heaven (or nearly so), while authentic from his point of view, ultimately is not conclusive (at least for me). The reader can draw his or her own conclusions.
B000062YAY|5.0|It's a shame that they never released a concert video of this show, but I just have to let my imagination fill in the visual aspect. It's fast, it's furious, it's Slayer playing some of the best songs from the period when they were at their best because Seasons in the Abyss was their last great album. Decade of Aggression is 90 minutes of intensity.

0316077046|3.0|So I've pondered Beautiful Darkness for over a week and I'm still not sure how I feel about this book.Part of me really enjoyed it and part of me, well, part of me was less than impressed.  If you remember, my feelings on Beautiful Creatures were also all over the place, though that had more to do with my comparing it to the movie version (bad habits die hard!). But despite any reservations that I may have had with the first book, there's definitely a good foundation for the story so I decided to continue on with the series. Andeven  after reading this book, all hesitation aside, I probably will pick up Book #3.<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness is exactly what the title suggests --- it's dark (much darker than its predecessor) and in it, both Ethan and Lena explore the sinister sides of Gatlin. And, consequently, themselves. The story takes place during the immediate aftermath of Lena's 16th birthday as she struggles to deal with the loss of Macon. Basically, she feels like Macon's death is her fault and her belief that she's doomed for darkness leads to a surprisingly gothic transformation. I really enjoyed seeing Lena-gone-bad, although, at times it got a little too emo. And of course, there's the inevitable romantic tension between Ethan and Lena. Unfortunately, this causes the beginning to drag as Ethan's constant brooding takes over. Enter Liv (a keeper in-training) and John Breed (the mysterious loner dude) to amp up the ambiguity in their already strained relationship.<br /><br />The story didn't really pick up until about 100 pages in with the appearance of an old fan favourite, Ridley. And let me just say, the mischief that her and Lena get into is well worth the wait. Ridley has quickly become one of my favourite characters. Honestly, where I loved Ethan in the first book, the side characters (Link, RIdley and Liv) really stole the show here. Each of them becomes central to the story, serving an integral purpose. Their choices all have life (or death) altering consequences. Garcia and Stohl flip the script on what we think we know and we quickly learn that people are more than what they initially seem. Especially Ethan.There's a reason he's so deeply bonded with Lena and he learns just how much his destiny is irrevocably intertwined in the caster world.<br /><br />Again, the pacing starts lacking until Ethan, Liv and Link team up on a hero's quest to save Lena from the clutches of evil. During their journey, there are many anticipated and unanticipated helpers along the way. However, the problem I had with this was in the too-convenient timing and in the identities of some of their saviors. I dunno, it felt too easy. I never really felt scared for the characters in the way I should have been, rendering the shock-value ineffective. Justice is never really served so there's no sense of loss or vindication. There was an emotional disconnect for me as a reader. And like the ending in Book #1, we're left with yet another non-ending. You can tell how Garcia and Stohl are setting the story up for future installments.Needless to say, it was somewhat frustrating.<br /><br />Beautiful Darkness is a book full of deceit, jealousy, love, loss, confusion and sacrifice. It's one of those stories that reveals many new truths that were previously unknown to key figures in the story. We're  driven deeper into the underbelly of the caster world and shown a darker sort of magic. Just about every character experiences some sort of transformation.<br /><br />\\"Lena and I would never be the same. Link and Ridley were so supernaturally altered, they weren't even in the same universe..\\"<br /><br />Can I just go on a side rant for a second regarding Link's big change --- umm, why? Can anyone tell me? Because it comes up out of nowhere and then they act like it's all a big joke. What was the point of that?<br /><br />I digress.<br /><br />By the end of the journey, many revelations are made, albeit some were more effective than others. Where therewere things I liked (like their quest), there were plenty of things that offset the good. While the story wasn't predictable, it didn't leave me on the edge of my seat. I found it to be amusing in some places and contrived in others. I had kind of hoped that writing all of my thoughts out would help me to sort my feelings more definitively, but it hasn't so I'll leave you with this: I liked the book enough to want to finish the series, but I thought the first one was marginally better (again, probably due to its wayward charm).<br /><br />Food for Thought: Beautiful Darkness is an amusing follow-up to Book #1 in the Caster Chronicles. While the pacing is uneven, the story is magically intense. Featuring some unbelievable appearances from an unlikely band of misfits, it's a dark journey into the bowels of the caster world and not everything is as it appears to be. The book, like Ethan and Lena, has its ups and downs but if you're like me, and you dig the foundation, it's definitely worth a read.were things I liked (like their quest), there were plenty of things that offset the good.

0767847431|5.0|That says it all. IF you saw this as a kid, you remember it. If you love sci-fi type flicks, it's one of the classics and you probably own it already.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I love the actors. Good try on the extra bits added to the story to make it fit the trilogy. But I would rather have all that imagination used to illustrate the world that JRR was trying to build in our minds when he wrote his adventure story of the hobbit. I probably will not buy the next two installments if the story continues to deviate like this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game I reccomend. it so fun plz send an update soon! so cool thanks a lot mobigrow!
B008EEBBIY|5.0|Lovely sound and feel to this music.  Reminds me of Coldplay before they went into the dance/electronica scene (which I, for one, think they did with Mylo Xyloto).  Musically (not lyrically or vocally) it's got the feel of some of John Mayer's songs, in terms of lightness, although I haven't heard enough of John Mayer to make a true comparison.  Anyways, I think it's a great album and I'm hoping for more.  After just a few listens, the tracks that stand out for me are:<br /><br />The Stairs — The sample gives an accurate impression of this song, so check that out and see if you like it.<br /><br />St. Croix — Definitely faster paced but not overdone or harsh (like some bands are with electronica or heavy percussion or whatever).<br /><br />Buried — A bit silly, very fun song, very nice lyrically and musically.<br /><br />Hero — So far in my view, the most poignant/emotionally potent song.  It's not that it's &#34;deeply moving&#34; or something—just very good music and evocative, for me at least.<br /><br />Probably some further listening will open up my views on the rest of the songs.  These are just songs that, if you're going to get a single, would give you a good impression of the album.  (Good as in actually good, and probably good as in accurate also. :)

B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood's performance in this movie is absolutely wonderful and unforgettable. I have to say this movie really surprised me. I expected to like it a little and maybe get a few laughs out of it based on the trailers I had seen. Well I ended up liking it a lot, and I laughed so hard I thought I was going to pee my pants. This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in the past decade. Eastwood plays Kowalski like he is just having a hell of a good time with it. Pulling all the stops out, laying back, and just letting it all hang out. Clint is so good at the role of this irritated pissed-off rachety old bigot that you can't help but love every second he's on screen. Line after line will keep you laughing out loud. Some very funny moments. If this is Clint's last role as an actor I must say he put a nice cap on an incredibly impressive and lengthy acting career. And just when you think you have laughed till your face starts hurting things get seriously powerful and touching. The ending will come as a total surprise. It does not end at all the way you expect it to. I have to say this is the best film I had seen in that entire year of it's release.

B00B671W6W|5.0|It's obvious, from the first track, that Anthrax is full of Rush fans.  They nail Anthem wonderfully!  Of the other covers, my personal favorite is Jailbreak.  At first glance,I thought it was going to be AC/DC's song, so it was a great surprise to hear Thin LIzzy.  The other covers are all good, with Keep On Runnin' being a pleasant treat.  Crawl is great, although the remix mightnot have been necessary.  Guys that was space that you could have placed another cover in...but that's a minor quibble over a great EP.  The stars say it all!
B000GWE44U|5.0|With out a doubt Stephen King's book get's the royal treatment in this superb Stanley Kubrick film, and The shining turns out to be the best film ever made from a Stephen King novel. Stanley Kubrick was for certain more than your average director. His films are often undeniable masterpieces. But even more so, I don't think anyone knew just how truly dangerous it was to put Stanley Kubrick and Jack Nicholson in the same room together. It certainly seemed like an odd pairing, but it worked very well. Stanley Kubrick allowed Nicholson to ham it up with all he had to muster and for that we as the audience are forever thankful. Nicholson's Jack Torrance is one of the greatest performances ever put on film. In fact every actor in this movie was cast so perfectly the movie just overflows with some of the best performances and memorable characters one could ever hope for. Shelly Duval turns in the best performance of her career as do numerous other actors, especially Scattman Crothers who is simply brilliant. Kubrick fills the movie with so much atmosphere that the audience can feel it all. You feel the sense of isolation. You feel the dream-like and creepy mood of the movie. And the creation of the Overlook hotel was a masterful achievement. One of the best performers in this movie is the hotel it's self. Of course Nicholson and King fans are the ones that wanted to see this movie the most when it was first released, and what they got is a dream come true for any fan of either of the two. There has never been a horror film like The Shining and there never will be again. It is a powerful, operatic masterpiece. It was also a very nice surprise to see the superb actor, Philip Stone who played Alex's Dad in a Clockwork Orange in this film as well in the small but memorable role of Delbert Grady. From beginning to end The Shining is by far one of the three best Horror movies ever made. It is not to be missed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this. Gave our family a lot of conversation time as we all read the three books!  Great read but definitely for more mature readers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is the perfect thing if you like  strategies or a challenge and its such a fun game to play
1451695195|3.0|The title could be misleading . . it should be called &#34;Let me talk about myself then eventually get to the main subject&#34;. If the author had simply wrote about his experiences while in a coma instead of going on and on about his life this book could've been a pamphlet. In other words, there's a lot of filler here that you have to wade thru to get to the crux of the book.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Of anything Daft Punk could have put out, this really wasn't what I was expecting at all.  Bewtween the robotic techno of Human After All, and then the orchestrated semi-robotic music from Tron: Legacy, the lush, gorgeous sounds on Random Access Memories are just stunning.  Get lucky, the single, is a fun, scrumptious taste of updated 70s disco, featuring Pharell Williams of N.E.R.D. fame.  I mention N.E.R.D. because, less than two days after getting R.A.M., I found N.E.R.D.'s album Nothing at a pawn shop.  The second track on that album, Hypnotize U, would fit on R.A.M. perfectly; coincidentally, it was co-written with Daft Punk.<br /><br />The only track I'm a little less than fond of is Georgio By Moroder, and that's only because I feel that the narration kind of throws off the music.  Maybe that's just me...<br /><br />Other highlights: Give Life Back To Music, the best Chic song of the last 20 years, and featuring Nile Rodgers, no less!  He pops up a coule of times.  Another standout is the Strokes-sounding Instant Crush, where Julian Casblancas sounds like he's trying to add range to his voice.  I'm loving Paul Williams popping up on Touch.  And last but most certainly not least, Contact, the closing track.  Slap this together as an EP with High Roller from the Crystal Method, Space Oddity from David Bowie, and Major Tom (Coming Home) by Peter Schilling!<br /><br />Long live Daft Punk!
B000OV85AW|5.0|Papillon is one of those movies that just sort of drifted into cinemas during a period when there were a lot of highly praised movies in the running, and unfortunately the film was greatly ignored and it drifted away far too quickly. 1973 was one of the biggest years ever for movies. Papillon had to stand up against a movie like The Exorcist. the film that smashed all time box office records. There was also American Grafitti, High Plains Drifter, The Sting(best Picture), Magnum Force, Enter the Dragon, Serpico, Mean Streets, Live and let Die, Walking Tall, Jesus Christ Superstar, and The Way We Were among others. All classics and all hit big at the box office. Most of them are still considered timeless classics by many and Papillon is less remembered, which is very unfortunate, because Both McQueen And Hoffman deliver superb performances. Some of McQueen's finest acting of his career is seen during the solitary confinement portions of the film. Though the movie is said to be based on actual events, some have complained that the movie doesn't accurately tell the story as the book did. IN short Papillon is simply a brilliant adventure film about one man's unswerving desire to be free and what he has to endure to finally have the freedom he has suffered to get. life in the penal system for Papillon would make an inmate in Chino feel like he's at a picnic. Incarceration in Papillon's world is tough and brutal. Franklin J. Shaffner director of Patton brings this story to life brilliantly. And as far as I am concerned Papillon is a timeless classic adventure story unlike any other. Well worth seeing.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Fun game but got an update. Since then, one of the powerups can not be used. It says the coin magnet is available at level five and I am already at eight.
0670022705|5.0|I believe I learned more per page reading this book than any I've ever read. A tour through all of history using objects collected (stolen?) by the British Museum, this book is a bravura execution of material culture and archaeological studies. In fact, I used several entries with my Advanced Placement Literature class in order to expose them to effective and interesting \\"close reading.\\" MacGregor does with objects what literary critics do with a passage of poetry: he describes the object (lovely pictures ARE included), he gives a fascinating context of the period in which this object was used, and finally, provides an analysis of what the object \\"says\\" about the people, nation, and region that used or owned it. I find this method of historical explication incredibly engaging. Rather than begin with abstract concepts like democracy, Federalism, or ethnic cleansing, MacGregor begins with the concrete--a vase, a coin, a flower pot-- and says here's what this culture produced, here's what that says about them. This also dovetails nicely with what I teach in class regarding advertising; that we can come to understand the ideals of a nation by studying its advertisements. Interestingly, the objects MacGregor chooses also function as \\"advertisements\\" for their respective milieus. A testament to how well this book is written and constructed is that I read it incredibly quickly. Before I knew it, I was on object 56 at the 300 something page mark and I had no mental fatigue. The fact that the book is organized in 100 3 to 4 pages \\"chapters\\" helps a lot because I found myself reading a few objects here and there whenever I had some spare time. I recommend this book highly to anyone who has even a fleeting interest in archaeology or cultural materialism; your efforts, and the rather hefty price of the book will be worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a fun game and the update put lava buckets and cakes in the game get this game now its cooooool
B00CSSRPGY|5.0|This is the first cd I get from Eliane. She reminds a lot to Diana Krall. Probably Eliane has a deeper voice which gives the songs a different sound. I enjoy her music swing and how she sings good old Chet Baker's repertoire.
B0015FML06|2.0|\\"U2-LIVE, WITH RED LINES\\" This legendary concert is so good that it is hard to think of any other live performace by any band in their 20's that could create this much excitement and electricity other than U2. I once owned the video of this show and consider it a classic event. So why the 3 stars? Well, the good news first. This performance is remixed in dolby 5.1 surround and it sounds just great. But here's the bad news, and it isn't the end of the world. This performance suffers from some poor original production quality. At times the image does look a little grainy, but that I can deal with. The thing I had a difficult time with is that through-out the concert there are red lines everywhere. This looks literally as if some child took a red crayon and drew meaningless lines all over the camera lenses. This appears to be a temporary burn-in that was captured with the cameras that were used for this 1983 concert. It appears Bright stage lights seemed to cause this problem, as the camera panned red trails or lines followed it. Now these lines would remain sometimes painting red squigglies everywhere. The problem is that I didn't see this as far as I remember on the video version, but it is distracting and you will notice it without a doubt. Also for reasons unknown a small section was deleted from this presentation during 'The Electric Co.' track. Originally The Edge finishes his solo then goes Bono into singing \\"La, la, la, la- America. Two, three, four...\\" Instead this version is missing this portion and Bono is back in the chorus before The Edge even finishes the solo. This was the track where Bono takes a white flag and moves off in the distance. It is one of the highlights of the show and it is a shame it is missing. So visually this DVD is not so great, but the sound is excellent.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|I love the cd.  I love tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, and 14.  Buy this cd.
B002AF4Y96|5.0|If you love Tarantino movies ( He wrote this one), you'll love this movie! Juliette Lewis is at her best in this movie as is Woody Harrelson. you also get a glimse of how great an actor Robert Downey Jr. is early in career. Great story. Great acting. Great action! What else could you want?
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was my first Ken Follett book and I couldn't put it down.  The descriptions bring the story and characters alive for the reader.  As soon as I finished Fall of Giants I bought Winter of the World so I could continue to follow the families throught the next geneation.  I'm not much of a reader but Fall of Giants hooked me into Ken Follett.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Cain offers excellent examples to support her assertions.  This book got me thinking about friendships, family and workplace relationships, and my own life experiences.
B000ID37SQ|5.0|Brain De Palma creates a truly heart stopping crime drama. Scarface was one of the first films to introduce audiences to a completely new level of violence that had never been seen in cinema before. The film released in 1983 was so violent that De Palma had to fight for months to avoid getting the film slapped with an X rating. In the end he settled for a judgement to have warning messages placed in tabloids and theaters instead. Al Pacino sets the screen on fire as the Cuban criminal Tony Montana. Despite the fact that at times Pacino doesn't quite get the accent just right it is easy for the audience to forgive him, because otherwise Pacino breathes passion and evil life into Montana. Tony Montana is considered undesirable and is sent out of Cuba by Fidel Castro on a boat to America. Once Tony arrives he decides he isn't going to settle for the existence of poverty and will stop at nothing to become one of the richest men in the world. Tony Montana is the sort of man that is self absorbed and brutal. No other human life means anything to him, and he kills anyone that stands in his way. Pacino's character represents the most vile and inhuman of people. The audience watches as Tony uses violence and greed to rise to be the head of an empire that is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But his greed and violent personality are also the weaknesses that lead to his downfall. Brian De Palma directs Scarface with furious passion. Moments of the film are lavish and exciting. Others are freightening and depressing. Buckets of blood abound as the body count rises. This 1983 remake is gritty and realistic. Also an interesting side note is that the TV series Miami Vice was inspired by this film. Scarface is an all out assault on the senses and the stomach. The end result is a powerhouse film about one man's violent rise to power that is unforgettable.
B005HSL626|1.0|i had this game on my ipod so i knew i liked it already, so when i got my kindle i just had to have it. well i cant play more than ONE single game without it freezing on me. its SO annoying i deleted it from my device AND my cloud games. very annoyed. fix this problem and i will be glad to download it again.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|A bit redundant in vocabulary and action but still a great, can't put down book! I am looking forward to starting on the next!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'm a slow reader but I finished Winter of the World in a matter of weeks.  I couldn't put it down.  A great story of multiple families heavily peppered with actual historical events.  Definately read this book AFTER you finish Fall of Giants.  This book is #2 in the trilogy.  I'm waiting for Mr. Follett to publish the third one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like app it is really fun. Some of the levels were a bit hard but it was fun to try and over come them.
B00AYR2FOI|2.0|Very weak album by a great singer and guitar player. Boz, this was a very weak attempt. The last four albums were so much better.
0307341550|5.0|This book was great. All her novels I enjoyed and read thru them fast. Her writing style is very unique and creative. Would recommend this
B0019N95IK|5.0|The first season of a great series. If you haven't watched them before, now is the chance to own and enjoy them. If you have watched them before, now is the chance to revisit.
0345529057|5.0|A must read and definately a must watch. Getting the 5th book. Very enjoyable and quite a thriller. Cant wait to read the next one.
B001H5X7JS|3.0|My roommate loves this movie, it's just not my type of humor. The extras, except for the deleted scenes, are mostly boring as hell.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Excellent history and input about the second greatest band in history. I have seen them live six times and it is always great to learn more about this amazing band.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Once in a while you find something that just works as it is suppose too and this one does. Nothing fancy about it just plain and simple does what it is suppose too.
B0083I90HU|4.0|What a stunning and poignant story.  I never knew this happened in France during the war, well at least not to this degree.  The author started off just right with the balance between Sarah's real time story and Julia, the journalists current story.  She hit just the perfect amount of sympathy for me without being overly soppy.  I started off reading it and not wanting to put it down as I wanted to discover, so desperately, what happened to Sarah and her brother.<br /><br />It did lose it's way a little for my in the last third of the book and some of the endings were overly convenient and a bit contrived for me.<br /><br />I gave it 4 out of 5 but do feel guilty about dropping that one star, given that I still think it is a must read for everyone.  I am now looking forward to watching the movie which has one of my favourite actors in it, Kristin Scott Thomas.
0790733226|5.0|Some folks got upset when this movie was different than the book. But if you look at the history of the whole project, you realize the author was as intimately involved in the movie as he was the book. So this IS the author's vision.<br /><br />Jodie Foster is her usual amazing self. The characters in this movie are all well thought-out - you feel like you know them after just a few minutes onscreen. The extras are interesting - from commentaries to &#34;how-they-did-its&#34; on the special effects.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Occasionally, when I find it hard to sleep I turn to these ambient sound apps to get me relaxed. I've used dozens of different ones (all the free kind) on both Android & iPhone.  The problem I've run into with all the other apps is that either the sound quality is terrible or the selection is very limited (or both).  I know that you can't expect a whole lot when the apps are free but aren't free apps supposed to signify what you're going to get with a paid version?<br /><br />That's when I found this app. This app has EXCELLENT sound quality for a good majority of their selection, meaning they sound realistic. What's more impressive is that there are dozens and dozens of sounds to choose from. You can even combine sounds to play simultaneously.  For example, want a campfire sound with the sound of the forest? How about crashing waves, the wind blowing, and the sound of rain and thunderstorms? This app can do this!!<br /><br />I love this app!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is really fun I think every one should should try this it is made for all ages if you don't like this game it is really weird it is a opportunity to run from something with obstacles you can play this when ever. I play this all the time and you can also buy things that will help you in the game like buy other people and don't be afraid to try temple run 2
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Enjoyed the game and hoping there will be more rooms soon. Was disappointed it ended so fast. I liked that the scenes were not distracting with loud  and obnoxious background music. The rooms were simple but the puzzles were challenging enough.
B000SL1Q2C|1.0|I really love this movie, but they did not said, that the DVD is coming from ITALY and that it takes almost ONE MONTH to ship it to my house. The Outside of the DVD was broken and now is use less. Had the buy me a new one. They should say something and/or pack it a lot better!!! :-(((
B002CNK1MK|4.0|Recently saw Jerry Maguire again and I got a kick out of the coincidence that Jonathan Lipnicki (Renee Zellweger's son in movie) was also named 'Ray' (Hoffman's name in 'Rain Man'). Talk about polar opposites who share the distinction of bringing out the 'heart' in Tom Cruise...no small feat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game! it really works your mind and the puzzles are always getting harder. i really love this game and it's challenges !
B004GYY714|5.0|id never live without it.Actually I agreed to trade my kidneys and my sister for the paid version...plus a pig
B0072GPQNG|5.0|when i first saw the cover, i really thought, that must be another okay movie. But when i start watching it, i could not let go of it
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|I have a Nexus 10 and this gamepad would not pair with my device. Not worth the money. Try again Nyko.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I enjoyed this fact filled novel about A disease that scares many of us. This story told through the victim of the disease puts you very close to how your life changes.
B00BHBBSZ2|4.0|This is a good app. You can choose to use a stylus or the keyboard. You have color options as well as the basic word processor choices for Bold, Italic, etc. . Very useful IMHO.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|this movie is great for the hole family. for sure we loved watching it and was laughing a lot. great
B008HJGPVO|4.0|this item works very well with my 8.9 kindell fire hd. also works well with my galaxy 3. i like it
B009NY43NY|2.0|It's a slightly better ending than I expected, but I expected 1-1.5 stars.  There are apparently a lot of, ahem, issues between Miss Harris and her fans (enemies?).  I've avoided seeing it until now (yes, I live in a cave to avoid spoilers).  Everything from things she did with characters to just the overall  quality to things fans have said to things she has said to threats from said fanemies (hey, if frienemies is a word now...).  I must admit, I have been disappointed -- greatly so -- in the last several books, but this is just out of hand.  Threatening harm to yourself or others if something doesn't go your way is just OMFG crazy.  Crazy threats that would make someone afraid to leave their home = not cool.  If you're one of those people, the ones that devoted to a book series that you'd go the threat route?  Time to put down the book or e-reader and do some yoga or something.  Chill.  That said, I do think fans should not be afraid to admit when their favorites have fallen.<br /><br />When Charlaine Harris does what she does well, she does it very well.  She makes you want more more more.  Likewise when she drops the ball, she does it so well that he ball deflates - pops even.  There is no saving it.  That is what happened with this series.  I cannot even remember exactly when that happened but it did.  I spent a fortune on her work.  When I started to get disappointed I learned my lesson - stop pre-ordering and wait for reviews.  This time around I was already so burnt out that I didn't even bother, I waited for my library to get a copy.  I made the right choice, Dead Ever After simply wasn't worth getting all worked up over.<br /><br />It felt like it was an attempt to squeeze in everyone that hated, loved, lusted after, felt neutral about Sookie for one last hurrah (at least the last one we'll see - I will not spoil the ending but I think it is at least safe to say that the world did not end).<br /><br />For some people the biggest question, before reading this book, is: Eric, Bill, Sam, other?  While not everyone will be happy with the answer, the answer did arrive.  Sort of.  This is Sookie, nothing is ever permanent in her love life.<br /><br />Will she become a vampire?  If I am not mistaken, Miss Harris did state early on whether or not this would happen, maybe?  Either way, this was answered.<br /><br />What happened to _____?  There's a good chance you at least learned something about anyone you were curious about, if they were still alive.  As I stated already, basically everyone connected to Sookie showed up in one way or another.<br /><br />How about the sex and violence and action?  It's here, it's just rather forgettable compared to earlier books.<br /><br />More backstories before we leave everyone?  Not so much.<br /><br />The only other Charlaine Harris books I read were from her Harper Connelly series.  I loved those.  I also felt that she didn't know how to end that series.  Maybe her problem simply comes with saying goodbye to her characters.  As the time to end it gets near, she loses her groove, or something.  Maybe this one just went on way too long.  Whatever the problem is, there is a problem.  For people curious about the series, I would actually recommend it - I loved it enough to buy the first five books or so in print, then when I switched to Kindle I had donated those to the library and re-purchased the set that was out at the time (I think through book eight).  Then my sister wanted to read it so I also bought another hard copy  to send to her.  When I did the libration donation, I gave them the Harper Connelly series and decided to re-buy that too.  I really do like CH books when done well.  If this genre is your thing, you won't be disappointed - at first.  I'd just recommend that you stop at about book eight or nine and let your imagination fill in the rest.  Or, if like me, you have some sick need to finish up once hooked, at least just finish up with library copies or copies borrowed from friends.rom friends.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I LOVE her music =)) And her singing voice is so dreamy, beautiful, poetic-like =)) It's a great cd to listen to when its raining outside =)) I would write a whole review on each song but, its just a cd you've got to listen to, take it in and I guarantee ya'll will want to listen to her over and over again =)))
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and challenging. I just wish they had more rooms because this only lasted two days. Great concept though. Really makes you think.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This soundtrack is filled with gorgeous, authentic Hawaiian music. It's relaxing, calming and even spiritual. I have played it to a crying baby who went right to sleep. There are lots of different artists, some vocals, some instrumentals, but it all comes together very nicely. If you are not familiar with Hawaiian music, this is a lovely introduction.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|Title: Choose Yourself!<br />Author: James Altucher<br />Publisher: James Altucher<br />Pub Date: Unknown<br />Reviewed by: Jennie Bev of BookReviewClub.com<br />Review Date: June 18, 2013<br />Rating: Recommended (3 of 5 stars)<br /><br />James Altucher is a brave man. Very brave. He's a confident self-made entrepreneur who was ready to make a change in his life. And he did. He was unsure, but he has passed that period and is now enjoying being in his own skin.<br /><br />I have a similar life and business philosophy: creating my own pathway and making my own mark. I don't wait for someone to pick me and make me a CEO. I started my own company and produced the products to be sold.<br /><br />Being an entrepreneur is like driving on a freeway. It is fast and furious. Sometimes you'd need to accelerate so fast that the view becomes blurry; sometimes you'd need to slow down so much that you'd stop. Either way, it takes courage and acceptance. To maintain sanity.<br /><br />Both Altucher and I have similar thoughts and ideas. Perhaps we can even be good friends. For sure, I can learn a lot from this curly-haired geek. Choose Yourself! is a good book to read.[]
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I am in love with her music, the music is beautiful and almost movie soundtrack quality to it... and that voice so beautiful!! I love her lyrics as well =)))
B008CP6RWU|4.0|Mini games are beyond silly (frankly weak sauce) but Flower and Journey are amazing.  Flow's controlls are enough to make me not want to play it though.  The whole everything is backwards use the motion control thing just isn't fun.  You lose because you can't control the thing instead of losing for actually lack of skill.
B004EPZ06Q|4.0|I had heard rumors about this sequel before seeing it, it seemed to be dragging out somewhat compared to the first one, but still enjoyed it!
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|I refuse to call this movie anything other than \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" but nonetheless, it's a fun campy movie.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|My son really likes this movie and we got it for a great price. We received it in the mail pretty quickly as well.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Cool game but not very hard enjoyed all the details and dialogue. Maybe you can make them a little harder
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I ordered this without seeing the movie first and loved it. I thought it was a great movie! I hope you enjoy it as well!
B00BWC1UZE|3.0|I'm not a big fan of &#34;boy band&#34; music but had seen a couple of the pieces from this album performed on TV and was interested in owning it.  Not at all disappointing, but not as new and exciting as I'd imagined.  Justin Timberlake has a good voice and the production values are pretty high, but this album, after all, a very commercial undertaking.  I'll keep it in the mix when entertaining, but I can't say I'd sit and listen to it as closely as I would to an artist such as Esperanza Spalding, but I admit that's trying to compare apples to oranges.  This is a good CD to put in a background mix.
0425263924|5.0|OMG!! Hooked on this series, I cannot wait until the 4th book comes out!!  Literally cannot wait.  I wish there was a release date already for the 4th book.  I started re-reading the series again.  My family and I have a mini book club because of these books.  Thank you Sylvia Day!! Keep up the good work, making the readers desire MORE!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very well done read. Felt like I was watching a documentary film. Enjoyed it right to the very end. Highly recommended.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This is SOO romantic and classic, I loved it from the start! If you love Sinatra or Dean Martin, etc. , you will love this CD!
B008P76UKE|4.0|I could have easily given this five stars except that as good as it is there were some transitions that weren't as smooth as I would have hoped.  Lorin Mazel is definitely a world-class conductor and has produced many fine recordings with many different orchestras - he has one of the more solid reputations, to be sure.  The Berlin Philharmonic remains one of my absolute favorite groups and their playing was stellar as usual.  It's just that Maestro Mazel's personal arrangement from this massive operatic opus wasn't always as smooth as one might hope - some of the transitions from one operatic section to another were a bit on the abrupt side.  It's a disc I enjoyed watching and definitely continue to watch over the years, but it's not my favorite - as good as it is.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed trying to figure things out. Some were a little tricky. But I like the challenge of it all<br /><br />.
B0018OHFK0|5.0|C'mon it's the first furious - I can't count how many times I've watched this through the years.<br /><br />Awesome. Really.
B00ASQSYI6|1.0|I've been looking forward to this series for some time its supposed to be a really great series but I can't even navigate the menus they are all in some sort of asian Text I can't read. Any one else have this problem? Going to obviously return this box set.
B000Q66Q06|4.0|When my old laser disc player died I wondered if I'd ever be able to replace some of my favorite discs in DVD or Blu-ray format.  I was delighted to see this DVD available through Amazon.com.  The Argerich performance is reason enough to search out this performance and watching the visual interplay she and Abbado establish is particularly exciting.  The sound quality isn't up to current standards although it is actually more than good enough to enjoy this great concert disc.  It's well worth adding to your collection.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was texting my friend and feel asleep and woke up 30 mins later cause the timer went off and saw that my iPhone had 13 messages ,also good for mad or sad moods to sleep to even bored. No more trouble sleeping for me hahaha!
0060581808|5.0|Great book, we bought if for our granddaughter not that makes a difference who we bought it for. Its a good book.
B0087HT36U|4.0|This is an enjoyable game of lobbying things at sitting targets to knock them down. It's good for insomnia late at night.
B008KYWM90|4.0|I love these shoes.  I have very small feet, and have a really hard time finding shoes in my size that stay on my feet and don't give me blisters.  These are a great fit for my size 5 feet, and cute, too!  My only negative is that the little flower button rubs my ankle bone a little bit.  It doesn't rub enough to hurt, but I can see it becoming bothersome if wearing them for a long period of time.  Otherwise they are a great pair of shoes and I will be getting a lot of use out of them!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Well written in detailed average man terms, meaning we can all enjoy it without being dazzled by someone's colorful vocabulary. This is a must read
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Don't make us wait for ever to find out what happens next in this sexy series.  Highly recommend this book.
B006Z7XNVK|4.0|The film manages to create a particular atmosphere and haunting quality that is palpable. While I'm not much for scary films, this one is ok because it's more about the suspense. Well worth the time to watch it.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I've been a fan of the series since Clash of Kings was first published. My bookcase was just about ready to collapse under the weight of the all the series I've read in my life. This is a much easier way of keeping the longer, bigger (hopefully better), series in one place without damaging my furniture. Just one detail, I'm using a new Kindle Paperwhite. Now, about this Kindle edition.<br /><br />Firstly, is it easy to navigate through 5000 pages of text? Yes. Using the go to function on the tool bar makes it easy to switch from book to book, chapter to chapter. Maybe earlier versions just has this as one MASSIVE tome, but the one I purchased was neatly broken down by book, chapter, and page. All the most recent cover art, the ones proudly bearing HBO all over the front, were all there in gray-scale beauty. Some 1 star reviews complained that they couldn't navigate the books easily. I haven't had a single problem with that. And this was the first thing I purchased for my Kindle.<br /><br />Next up, is it worth it? For me it was, yes. I hadn't purchased the A Dance With Dragons yet, my copies of Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings are somewhere between Chicago and Colorado Springs, and my copy of Storm of Swords and Feast for Crows were given to my neighbors. I reread any book I like at least once a year if not more. Having the five published ones on hand for less than the paperback price? Worth it. If you've already got the actual books, and have recently switched over to a Kindle, maybe just buy the individual books.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? Call it sentiment. I like having a collection of books on a shelf I can show off. Also, on a nitpicking level, I'm never a fan of cover art that ties into a movie or television adaptation. I can never be sure the price I'm paying isn't being slightly inflated for the privilege of showing the HBO logo. But this is nitpicking and highly personal. If you don't mind that, and I know I really shouldn't, just go with the first two points of this review.<br /><br />Hope this helps.ts of this review.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

0812550706|3.0|I felt the end was predictable. The battle room game descriptions became repetitive a third of the way through the book and the action just did not keep me particularly interested. The book was ok just not great. So much so that I have no interest in the other Ender books. Perhaps younger readers would like it better.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Hanson's \\"Anthem\\" has a great Motown, retro feel to it.  This band evolves with each album, and Anthem is no exception.  The first few songs start off strong as high-energy, rock and roll tunes.  There are a couple of ballads as well - and I think these have the most power of any of their previous ballads.<br /><br />I would venture to say this is their best album to date, although it might be neck and neck with \\"Shout it Out.\\"
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If you enjoy Zombie novels you are in the right place. If you also enjoy documentary story telling, whether in print, television, movie, etc you will enjoy the styling of this novel. The story is set in the stories of the participants who survived to tell their stories  surrounding the great Zombie War sometime in the present to near future.<br /><br />I felt the book was slow to get going but once you got in a ways the pacing and story telling style fit well and made the story enjoyable. In some ways it felt more real to be led through the story through the individual stories and plot lines set all over the world. Each of the pieces joined with the others to give you the full story but also allowed the author to focus on a large number of specifics. A novel set in one location or with one smaller group of people would have had trouble telling the story. By spreading the story into the large number of smaller parts you could be taken all over the world and see so many of the issues we would face if a true World War Z ever happened.  It also made it easy to read a section or two at a time over lunches and spare time here and there.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great zombie tale that also looks at the logical issues of how do you survive and win a Zombie war covering the entire Earth this is a great one. If you would rather focus on a small group trying to survive look elsewhere. The Walking Dead TV series for example. I throughly enjoyed this novel though and it will stick with me for a while.
0547572298|5.0|Wow! Ubik was a wild ride, even by Philip K. Dick's standards. Or perhaps a better way of putting it is the book meets the high standards he creates for his works, and then some!<br /><br />As the book begins, we meet Glen Runciter, head of the world's top anti-psi agency (to combat all of the psi organizations that have arisen now that it is 1992 -- heh!), located in New York City. He confers with his late wife, Ella, who is dead and buried in a Swiss moratorium, where she is in a suspended state of &#34;half life,&#34; through &#34;cold-pac&#34; --- something like our cryogenics. The world's top psi's are disappearing, and Runciter wants his wife's opinion on what to do. She thinks they should advertise more.<br /><br />We then go off to met Joe Chip, Runciter's top man, who is dirt poor and in debt. A Runciter scout has brought a young woman named Pat by to meet Joe. Pat has an unusual ability to nullify events before they even happen. Her psi tests are off the charts, and Joe marks on her report that she should be watched, that she could be dangerous.<br /><br />Runciter has a visitor from a businessman with a business on Luna (the moon?), in need of immediate anti-psi help. Runciter agrees to overlook some typical preliminaries, since it's an emergency, and soon he's leading Joe, Pat, and nine others to Luna to save this company. Where they're sabotaged. A bomb goes off in the room in which they're gathered and Runciter takes it the worst. He's pretty much dead, and the team rushes to get him into cold-pac in the spaceship so he can be saved and consulted with his wife. Joe starts planning on how to get back at their enemies from that moment forward. And from that moment forward, things start unraveling. It gets really PKD-like as alternate realities are discovered and time moves backward. Joe starts receiving odd messages from Runciter while members of the team start dying off, decomposing quickly. Soon the surviving members find themselves back in 1939 in Des Moines IA -- Joe has to get there by bi-plane. They're there for Runciter's funeral, but by now, Pat is under deep suspicion for being behind this, plotting with their enemies, and Joe's really ticked. Soon the reader doesn't know who is dead and who is alive!<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, but I'll just let you know that it's a typical PKD mind-f*** which is immensely satisfying while still being a bit confusing. It's a lot to swallow at once. Ubik rears its head at the beginning of each chapter in the form of an unusual ad for an unusual product, and Ubik plays a real role at the end of the book, but it's a bit mysterious at that. Suffice it to say that it's a miraculous spray can that is Joe's only way to stay alive.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick's eye for minutia is especially good in this novel as he highlights magazines from 1939 (real ones), early cars, etc. And this book is a fast paced thriller too. I read it in less than a day. I couldn't put it down. No wonder Time magazine chose it for inclusion as one of their &#34;100 best English-language novels!&#34; No argument there. I don't know if this is my favorite Philip K. Dick book, but if not, it's close. It's got the usual PKD themes like unreliable and alternate reality, time running backward, precognition (Minority Report, anyone?), telepathy, paranoia, hallucinations, and even spirituality. It's got a fantastic ending. It's a great introduction to Dick, if you're unfamiliar with him, and if you're a fan, it's a must read. You won't be able to put it down. Highly recommended.Moines IA -- Joe has to get there by bi-plane.

B00992CF6W|4.0|I didn't give it five stars because my house just randomly set on fire I had no fire or lava around the area.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is so much fun.  I love being able to play against other people.  This game can get addicting.  Once you start it's hard to put it down.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|The ditched the director that brought the book to life in the first Move.  Cheaped out on the musical score  and figured the teeny bopers would not notice...... But teey bopers grow up......... and remember
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Anyone who loves this saga won't be dissapointed. Everthing looks great, I just hope that I didn't jump the gun, cause 3D would be rediculous.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I like all of these. They have many historical elements and the characters are very well developed. The actors are terrific.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|A very amusing story but a lot of heart soaked in every page. As a fan of Craig Ferguson, I found the journey he went on to get where he is to be one of the bravest  things I have read about in recent years. I found myself, at one point, wishing he would have gotten to rehab sooner(in the story) but it would have taken a lot away from the story. Worth the read, even if you're not a fan.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie  to one of the best jobs converting lit characters to the screen.  Most every episode is a delight.  Worth having it oh the shelves.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Finally! This book celebrates and reinforces that introverts are not weird! They are not doing anything wrong. It is not a state of non-conformists and outliers. It is absolutely positive reinforcement for those of us who are not interested in excessive stimulation and attempts to pretend we're just like those who love to be in the spotlight. It is complete permission for us introverts to enjoy this character trait and value how we positively impact society and the workplace!<br /><br />For the first time in my life, I embrace my introversion. I really value how Susan Cain helped me accept, moreso embrace, my introversion. I've spent WAY too much energy trying to make it go away. It is what it is, and there's nothing wrong with it!<br /><br />Thank you, Susan Cain!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I like all of these. They have many  characters that are very well developed. The actors are terrific. Keep em coming

B00338QENI|3.0|It took me more effort to finish the book than I normally take. My wife loved the book, and I kept trying to love it but found it not that interesting. I kept looking for something earth shattering, and never found it.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game ... Can't wait for new rooms.  Challenging enough ... Without being to difficult. I like a game that makes you think.
1401923127|5.0|This is a book worth rereading.  Draws together the physical and spiritual work in a reasonable manner.  Worth the read!
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I absolutely loved the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy. Maggie did a fantastic job like always.<br /><br />However I felt like there were a few unanswered questions.<br /><br />--SPOILER ALERT--<br /><br />I didn't feel a lot of emotion coming from Sam when Beck died. I also didn't like how Isabelle suddenly had to leave back to California, it was very sudden and abrupt but that's just my opinion. Another thing would be how Grace, Sam, and Cole didn't exactly find the cure, even though the meningitis seemed to be it, it wasn't a 100% cure and they were thinking it was without being exactly sure. Even though Sam could still be a wolf thanks to Cole, it wasn't the cure I was thinking of. I still wish we could have met more of the teenagers that Beck and bitten in Shiver. I may need to reread the series to make sure I knew who got bitten. I know that Cole was one and I think Victor was one as well, but I think there was a girl too.<br /><br />However I LOVE how each chapter is another character's view, I really like that. However this is a fantastic series! Too bad it came to a end!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I felt challenged and it  gets your brain thinking, it's a great exercise for your thinking skills.I would recommended this game to anyone who likes puzzles.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved playing this game! although they could make the rooms a little harder as you go up levels, but none the less its a very fun and enjoyable game to play.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|One heck of a good series. Is it accurate?  Heck no,  but it holds your attention and you might want to find out what really happened and  gasp! read about it!
1402210086|4.0|The missing star is just for the look of the cover: it's scribled on front and stickered on back.  It's the book I loved in the far past,and decided not to take with me to college on the grounds that it just wasn't cool enough.  I don't know where it is now but it's nice to see Heyer still has an audience`
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Where was the editor? Who gets turned on by a tooth brush? Wtf did I just read? I kept reading to see if it got better and no it didn't. And why does the main character refer to her pussy to her sex?
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I has good songs, would recommend it highly.Wasn't always a fan of her music, but she is changing my mind..
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Kirk Douglas has Spartacus covered  but if you want MORE Lucritia and Batiatus.... the real power houses of the series.  THIS IS THE SERIES FOR YOU!!!!
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|fun, just plain fun. Don't over think it... it's Die Hard in Russia with lots of cars blowing up. NUff said.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I was surprised when I played this game. The graphics r impressive it reminds me of the Spider-Man one game for PlayStation two
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I was looking for a good read and purchased this based on the reviews. I'm glad I did since it kept me turning the pages while ignoring everything else that I should have been doing! One minute I suspected one thing and the next, something else. It's nice to read something you aren't quite sure of the ending for a change.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Good actor, great visuals but..... we all know how it ends.... and they are dragging it out to 3 movies.... that takes......hutspah
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Great beat & vocals, catchy melody which demands playing over & over again. Perfect song to enjoy at this summer's parties
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After I watched season one, I couldn't wait until I got some alone time to start season two.  I was not disappointed, it has some historical teaching, a little passion, some drama, and was overall very well done
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|Another movie which should be under CLASSICS!!! Should be in everyone's collection of movies!! If you haven't seen - buy this !!
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This is my favorite of the HP movies.  Complex and exciting.  I often watch the first one and this one and feel......happy.
B00000G3I2|5.0|The Big Chill (15th Anniversary Collector's Edition) Classic Film & great Actors & story many can relate to, great buy to add to my DVDs love to watch
B0021L9ME6|5.0|I watched the movie and it had a good story line 'if you love cats then this movie will fall  right into your wheel house.Yes it's not the regular cat woman story line but it does have alot of historic cat aspects of the history of the cat coming to america and how independent a cat really is, plus halle berry play's cat woman perfectly! It's a movie you will get into if you just realize all super hero's are fictional and just like the avengers dvd you fall into the action and the theme of the movie and have fun and enjoy the cast and actors as the way the script was presented!
B008OM0EDO|2.0|Sacha Baron Cohen made a name for himself putting together elaborate characters in unfamiliar situations.  This film was a collection of bad sketch comedy strung together and poorly acted.  Skip it.
B00BSO2U1Y|3.0|If this is what Bellini intended, then that is indeed very interesting to know as well as experience.<br />However, I feel that by being \\"authentic\\", this recording, with its very underplayed acting, paradoxically imparts a very modern sensibility to Opera in general and to this one in particular.<br />I find it hard to believe that this is what early 19th century audiences relished. It could work as an intimate Chamber / Concert affair as one reviewer suggested. An amusement for kings and such...<br />Norma is a very flawed, volatile and capricious but ultimately noble woman. Every angle of this comes out in Callas's handling of the role. In Bartoli's, I feel the attempt at imparting an authenticity has merely diluted the tremendous and frankly quite implausible drama that is the very essence of this larger-than-life legendary opera heroine.<br />I won't get into all the other aspects. Overall an enjoyable experience. But I dug out the 1960s Callas version and listened to the finale again. That was magic. This...this is an interesting diversion.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I love puzzles and these r good and challenging. I'm having a blast.  my kids like it too.  you will enjoy this game
B007DIQC90|5.0|I am more of a harder played music, but enjoy listening to the newer music now a days. Of Monsters and Men have come out of no where and their sound is amazing. If your thinking about buying this CD, and are skeptical, don't be. They have a sound that separates each song so they don't all sound the same.<br /> I have CDs in my collection that are ones in which I can put it on and listen to the entire CD from start to finish and not skip one song as each song is enjoyable, I have heard most of the songs on this CD on Pandora or on Sirius and I can tell you, this CD has the sound like it may join that part of my collection<br /><br />Proud Amazon.com worker<br />Robert H.<br />San Bernardino, California
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Khaled Hosseini is an amazingly talented writer who captivates his audience and does a wonderful job of relaying his many different characters voices in his latest novel.  He also does a fantastic job of creating beautiful imagery, as always.  However, I must admit that I feel that there were too many characters and too many storylines to follow in this multifaceted book, which for me prevented me from sinking my teeth into the plot. I feel he branched off in too many directions and left me with too many unanswered questions with too many loose ends left at the end of the story.  He did manage to weave the stories together well and perhaps this was the challenge he set for himself.  I loved “The Kite Runner” and “A Thousand Splendid Suns”.  Keep writing, Khaled.  I look forward to reading your next piece.
B000FJGWBC|5.0|I really like this movie and had it on the prehistoric version called div-a-da (aka DVD lol), and just had to upgrade to blu-ray! Still gets me that they say your dvds up-convert. Un-convert is NOT as good as blu-ray!!! IDC how much they were smokin' when they made that claim. I call their BS!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good compared to most apps like this. The one thing I didn't like was how much you need the gems to continue in the game, which cost REAL money
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The only reason this book gets only 3 stars from me is because it's way too short, just like book 1 - 6.  I bought every series for $2.99 or close to it, each book.  Making it over $20.00 for a book.  I say a book because every series is so very short which makes all the series \\"one\\" book.<br /><br />What a scam shame because the story is a great story.  Just too bad I will not be purchasing series #8.<br /><br />Seriously author?  Taking advantage of your readers?
1400052181|4.0|This book took me a little longer to read since I needed to get the full understaning of what really happened to this family.  I recommend that it be read by as many people as possibe-to show that the poor has been exploited from way back, and it still continues today.  This lady did so much for the world and her family got little or no recognition.  This was a sad story, but it is a piece of HISTORY, in this case it is- HER STORY, a legacy that needs to told continuosly.<br />EN
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Works great but will not update. This has been a, needed improvement over swype.  More accurate and better predictions. I would recommend this keyboard and will gladly change my rating once the issues are fixed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. You find clues in the room to help unlock the elevator. Tests your observation skills as well as your detective skills.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I got this game thinking my kids would love it.  They do, but I ended up liking it more. It is a lot of innocent, cute, and sometimes complex, fun.

B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love this game! Keeps me on my toes... it's a good time waster if you have free time. I totally recommend this game.
B00BY8DIT2|3.0|I love love love Beth Hart and immediately bought this album when I saw it was out.None of the songs stand out and I don't think it is good as some of her older albums.I would have preferred more blues to rock and roll.
B003XE1DG0|2.0|I was very disappointed with these..had the same shoes about 6/7years ago and they fit perfect and were great rain shoes. The new crocs seem to be made much more narrow and do not stretch as well.
B0058YZ2KG|5.0|These shoes are everything you need! They are comfortable with no stink after you wear them with no socks. Awesome!!!
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|I rented the movie.<br />I watched about 15 minutes of the movie and then Amazon locked up.<br />I got to watch a bunch of dots run around in a circle and that was it.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!<br />Go to another service.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun yet challenging game. Good graphics. The game could use some better music and some more challenging escape scenarios.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Once you start his series, The Camel Club,&#34;  you can't stop reading them until you have gone through all four!!  Each one is better than the predecessor.  Baldacci is a master at painting visual pictures in a verbal world.  His characters' personalities are masterfully developed to the point you feel you know each personally, and are led to react to them as if you were in each action packed scene.  Wish he'd do another!!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Pos. Good graphics,you can talk to your team with out Skype,it's team fortress 2 but better .Neg. nothing negative. Now if you excuse me I have a game to play.
B00005N6KG|5.0|They stay on the ear indefinitely without constant manipulation and with no feeling of weight. They are without doubt the best and easiest to use.
B004XZR63M|5.0|While I may or may not agree with everything in the book, it provided for me a very conscious mindset shift on how I view money and business. I highly recommend this read from an educational stand point, even if you think it's crap, as a way of questioning what and how you think about money and working.
B00338QENI|5.0|It is important to be aware of Henrietta Lacks life and legacy. This is an important piece of our history.

0937381888|5.0|Very informative. A good read if you are just getting into homebrewing. A great resource to keep around for future reference.
0547884591|5.0|I bought the kindle version and found it a little hard to follow (just with how things lined up etc) but I love the printed edition. Filled with many useful things, helpful pictures and direct links to what I'm looking for. Great book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A beautifully thought out page turner that will leave you wanting more. John Green, captured these characters so well. I would highly recommend this book.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Has a lot of good information<br />Students who would like to fulfill a good education ,and people who like to read
0316776963|5.0|Very funny and insightful. I think we can all relate to alot of what happens in David's novels. The next book I read will definitely be a Sedaris book
B005R32L66|5.0|FREE CALLS Worldwide you can NOT beat it! Of course I downloaded this for my tablet and I am having a little problem with it, I tried to send a message and it has NO &#34;SEND&#34; button and it does NOT work to just use the &#34;ENTER&#34; key, so I do NOT know what i don't know what is going on with it.<br />I have been using Skype for over 10 yrs. on my computers or laptops and it is very easy to download and start using.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Big fan of Myst so I loved this game, can't wait for the next installment.  Worth the small price tag
B005HSG3TC|2.0|It is to flimsy and will not hold the kindle as I expected it to.  Went and bought a different one.
0143116738|4.0|One aspect of this type of book is when the author has one new idea or technique, that they merely keep repeating throughout the book. One can usually get most of what one needs by reading the first couple of chapters. I think this is why so many people give up on them, at some point.<br />The Element is different, it is more of a journey that you take with the authors.<br />I especially liked the chapter &#34;finding your tribe&#34;, as a person who is very artistic and with an attention deficit, I have often found myself on the outside looking in.<br />They are kinda name droppers, but i guess that is the connections that they have made.<br />I recommend this book to anyone, who is struggling to find their place in the big picture.
B00B6QXN56|4.0|This is a very good album. I rated it the way I did because I prefer electric guitar more. This album is great if you prefer or like acoustic guitar. As with most albums it has some songs from other albums. All are good but like I said I prefer electric.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Yes, it's great. Yes, it's classic Clutch. Yes, if you love Clutch, you will love this one.<br /><br />That's it. Buy the damn record
0440246008|4.0|I am a Jack Reacher fan so I always enjoy these books.  This one seemed \\"stand alone\\" so if any of you read this one first, I would encourage yo to go back and read them in order.<br />My only complain about Lee Child (or his publishing house) is the price of the kindle edition...why should I pay more for the e-edition than for the paperback when they don't have to print it or ship it? Also I cannot loan it to a friend so it is a one per person sale for them.  Until they get with the 21st century, I will continue to get these books from the library!<br />Sandra
B000255LNE|5.0|This is great CD. The arrangements, specially the one live, are exceptionally good.  It is a romantic, poetic and nostalgic all in one CD.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I have been a Joe fan for about the last year or so. I feel that his guitar playing is the best of today's blues players. I have most of his albums and I feel that this is the best so far. If you like good clean sounding blues I think that you would love this album.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Ms. Sandburg has a wealth of experience, and compliments it with diligent research to create anecdotes which convey important points.  A must read for women and men who want to work in true equality.
B007REABAG|5.0|This 14 disk set is a tribute to one of the United States best bands, and hardest working bands CHEAP TRICK!  While some comments on this box were critical, not me, this set is great.  The sleeves are cover reproductions done in glossy format, there is a booklet on what is listed on the CDs, it is very hard to read the actual sleeves, not surprising, but the booklet sums up everything for you.  The first 4 studio CDs have bonus material and all of the disks have been remastered so the sound on all the disks is very good.  The set is nicely cased in a small box that will be easy to store.  The set also features the double disk recording of Budokan, the rarely seen Found All The Parts EP, and the band authorized release of Next Position Please.  Could the book been better, yes.  Could there have been more freebies, sure.  And the price would be in the triple digits.  But since we are buying the music, the price fits for a 14 disk set.  But if you are like me and a huge CT fan this set is fantastic,  many of the middle era disks I didn't have on CD, example the Jon Brandt era, but they are still really good and I'd forgotten how good this band has been since their first album.  However, The Doctor is still a bad CD.  Get this set!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm still reading this at the moment. It is the first book I ever purchased for my Kindle Fire. I do love that I can also read it on the Kindle app for my phone too!
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|There's nothing quite as wonderful as sitting down with a cup of tea and a good book. Well, to my delight these books are not only good, but also contains a startling amount of textual tea-drinking, so I feel as though I made a good choice.<br /><br />The writing is witty and sweet (if sometimes repetitive) and Alexia is a delightfully self-reliant heroine full of dry wit and propriety. The antics of the werewolves and vampires of London, including their wildly varied sartorial choices, are entertainingly light and swiftly paced. Honestly, if you're looking for deep and hard-hitting steampunk this really isn't the series you should be looking at--nevertheless, it's highly entertaining and a fast read.
1781162646|2.0|I can see I am in the minority with all these great reviews for Joyland but did I miss something? I have read all of SK books and this one just didn't do anything for me. What the hell was this book about? There were so many characters in it that I was getting dizzy. I could not get into this book until the last 20 pages. Definitely not one of my favorites by SK. The greatest book in my opinion from Mr. King was \\"IT\\" That is one book I can actually read over again.
B0051HNMTI|2.0|Nice easy to use app. Great layout. I already had all five daily  apps that are included in this app plus daily ball app, I believe they are all updated to v2.24 in May. I decided to get the Daily Workouts to clean up the clutter and guess what? IT'S ONLY v2.20. New version offers in app purchases.<br /><br />Just seams silly to go backwards in versions. I would rather have the updated clutter then an outdated app.<br /><br />I am un-installing until they get the new update
B0041KKYCY|5.0|Hmmm! after watching the first I Spit On Your Grave back at a local drive-in early 70's, i was a little dubious that a remake would come even close to a classic revenge film.. But i must say that this remake may be even better than first film staring the most beautiful camille keaton. I and some buddies of mine left the drive-in holding onto our manhoods hoping that they were still there?? The 2010 remake surpasses the first one by far. the most beautiful and talented sarah butler did a fantastic job with her acting in the newer version. A lot of the scenes in the newer version were a little hard to watch as to what these scumbags did to this innocent girl, but when she takes revenge on these lowlifes, they finally get what they well deserved. the sheriff in this film was equally just as bad gets what's coming to him also. Seeing this cute and innocent girl being molested and stripped was enough to make anybody squirm in their seats. You can tell she is traumatized by what happens to her when she wanders through the woods half naked in a stupor. but when she regains her mental state of mind... ahh revenge comes quickly and deadly. i found myself wanting to yell at her.. cheering her on when she takes revenge on these sick scumbags. considering the perverse storyline and graphic nature of the film, i think all male and female actors did a quite remarkable job portraying their characters. I can really say that after watching this movie it sticks in your memory and makes you wonder about what people would do if presented with the same sort of circumstances. after watching this remake i now am interested if there will be a newer film with sarah butler and some of the same actors, maybe with a little less graphic stuff. overall a great film, and one sure that will long be remembered.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|first off, get the deluxe edition, the extra songs are great. The album is the dark, doom metal we've all come to love. Tony's riffs are great and catchy as ever, with song like God is Dead?, Age of Reason, Damaged Soul, Zeitgiet. Ozzy's Vocals are as great as ever and it seems like his age is never going to show. Geezer really stepped on this album. His thumping, thick bass lines are prevalent and heavy. Bill's drumming is what any fan of Sabbath would expect. Just a really great, old school heavy metal/doom album all around and is as lyrically great as ever. This is one of the best Sabbath albums ever.<br /><br />End of the Beginning - Dark and Heavy. Classic Tony Iommi riffs. Geezer's bass lines are awesome and I particularly liked his fills during the bridges and verses.<br /><br />God is Dead? - Great song. Love it. starts off slow and dark with Geezer's bass lines going for a walk behind Tony's melody. at the half way mark of the song, Tony kicks in with another epic blues inspired metal riff like the ones from the early days of Sabbath.<br /><br />Loner - great hard rockin' tune with, and I know I keep saying this, a crushing bass line. it reminds me of a more upbeat lord of this world.<br /><br />Zeitgeist - This song is very pretty. It's very remnant of Planet Caravan. It's tranquil, calming, employs bongs for drums and a slow swelling flanger guitar effect that, like the lyric says, give you the feeling that you're falling through space.<br /><br />Age of reason - A nice and heavy tune that you can't help but bang your head to. A few minutes in the mood switches and becomes darker with a very evil sounding Tony Iommi riff.<br /><br />Live Forever - This song almost feels like it belong Master of Reality with songs like Lord of this World.<br /><br />Damaged Soul - Dark and bluesy. The melody is haunting and downtrodden. Tony's leads are from a true blues man. I can't talk highly enough about this song.<br /><br />Dear Father - They decided to end the album on a song Doom song. Good riffs, exception drum fills and driving bass lines.on a song Doom song. Good riffs, exception drum fills and driving bass lines.
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|If you like stone sour you don't need any reviews.  this is the best stuff they have put out yet.  More specified in approach yet somehow even more &#34;raw&#34; then when they started out.  Great albums, both of them.
0316044938|5.0|This is one interesting form of writting from a different angle. It was hard to put the book down. I am not going to spoil it. Let you decide..........
B000EJ9VV6|5.0|This stellar album was reissued on vinyl under the radar.  I've been looking for it for years, so that's the only way I can explain missing it upon release.  Regardless, I am thrilled to have this iconic album in my collection finally!
B00BKBCF38|5.0|Everyone was worried that this album wouldn't stand up to their great, and loved first album. I love the first album, amazing album, but this album stands with it and leaves nothing to be desired. Every aspect of the album is fantastic and Just as good as the first. I think the reason some people didn't like this album as much or said it was a let down was because there was less doom metal, while the first was all doom metal. While there is less, there is still some of the Doom metal I've ever heard, and all the music on the album is just fantastic. The awesome and heavy doom songs like Per Aspera Ad Inferi, Secular Haze and Year Zero are great, and some of my favorite Ghost songs. Songs like Ghuleh / Zombie Queen and Monstrance Clock are beautiful and captivating.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I downloaded this application &amp; gave it a spin. Navigation was a little awkward and the ability to do dome tasks was limited. By the time I was through with my personal test drive, I was frustrated enough sign the overall experience I thought I would only use this appears on a very limited basis. However, upon exiting the application, SPYWARE SHIELD gave me the first alert for a dangerous app thst it has ever given me.<br /><br />Perhaps I just don't understand what is going on, but I do have many dozens of apps of all kinds onmy 32 GB drive and this has been my only warning. Perhaps Amazon or the developers can explain to me why this would be a &quot;false positive.&quot; Until  that happens, I prefer to err on the side of caution and trust SPYWARE SHIELD over the Facebook app.It does give me pause to consider that this might be a case of the app allowing Facebook to do what it normally does and SPYWARE SHIELD senses such actions as obtrusive to my privacy!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I am a huge Eagles fan.  I have only watched the first disc, but it was so cool seeing all these guys when they were so young.  You won't even believe what Glenn Frey looked liked in his younger years.  What a stud.  I have now bought tickets to their History of the Eagles concert, so I hope to get through the discs before we go to the concert.
0525478817|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I read it in a single sitting until 4.30am because I just couldn't stop.<br />If you don't think you need this book in your life, you're wrong.
B00BX3KZAS|5.0|The album is everything we want from Bodom. It's melodic, fast, heavy with hints of black metal all thrown in. Alexi's leads with blistering, as always, and there was great use of neo classical and some almost bluesy styles. I see people saying that this the best album since hatebreeder or deathroll and while it's definitely one of the best, I have a problem with those statements. Deathroll and the earlier albums are great, but I'm way more of a fan from everything deathroll and up. Are you dead yet was amazing, blood drunk is epic and there is some really great shit on relentless, reckless forever. Point is, this album is great and it stands with all the albums, be they old or newer.<br /><br />Waste of Skin - Very fast, very old school Bodom. Alexi's solos tear through the song and harmonize perfectly with keyboards.<br /><br />Halo of Blood - The production of this album was helped by a member of the black metal band, Hypocrisy, and it shows. It's dark, brutal, and very black metal, both musically and lyrically. The drums really stand out because they take an extreme black metal approach.<br /><br />Scream for Silence - Bodom always seem to put out one or two really great, slower and melodic songs like angles don't kill and banned from heaven and with this song, they have done it again. This song is full of great melodies, my favorite being the evil sounding verse riff.<br /><br />Transference - This song is nice and heavy and really reminds me of stuff off are you dead yet.<br /><br />Bodom Blue Moon (the Second Coming) - This song is nuts. Crazy fast guitar/keyboard melodies, heavy and inventive riffs, shredding solos and it's very old school neo classical Bodom. Love this song.<br /><br />The Days Are Numbered - Very fast and heavy.<br /><br />Dead Man's Hand on You - Interesting song for Bodom. It's the slowest song they've ever done and it's full of clean guitar and keyboards. The song builds towards a very great solo before ending.<br /><br />Damaged Beyond Repair - Heavy, heavy heavy. This is probably the heaviest and best songs on the album. You can't help but head bang and love the epic melody.<br /><br />All Twisted - This song sounds straight from Deathroll. Great track.<br /><br />One Bottle and A Knee Deep - Great riff and it reminds me a bit of stuff from hatebreeder. Crazy solo.Repair - Heavy, heavy heavy.

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I don't think this game deserves one star, not fun if you actually want to do something other than fly around. its basically a retarded iron man themes temple run.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Its a good game, I love that you catch your own animals, and the setup is cool. keeps me entertained when I'm bored.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Jay Cole will be KING one day! His last album was great this album is 10 steps closer to the thrown. Amazing artist, Amazing album and Jay Z is just keeping the thrown warm until he hangs it up and it's in my opinion going to go to Cole or Kendrick.
034580404X|5.0|Other than the fact that Anastasia Steele's personality is copied from Twilight's Bella Swan, this is a magnificent love story. You have to be open to an abundance of erotic encounters, but it is tastefully done. I couldn't put it down.
B007REV4YI|1.0|What movie did you people see? Casino Royal was brilliant. Quantum was a sad attempt to be Bourne like. Skyfall was dull, dreary and dank, with out a shred of fun, but most of all, ridiculous. Moneypenny accidently shoots Bond in the upper chest with a high powered rifle , he falls a hundred feet into an ice cold river, is last seen descending 15 feet below the surface, unconscious with nobody any where near him. Bond inexplicably survives and to be politically correct, sharpshooter Moneypenny is promoted so they can track down Javier Bardem`s over the top effeminate villan. Lucky for Bond, who looks and acts washed up, he doesn`t have to face Bardem`s far more menacing character Anton, from No Country for Old Men. Add State of the art, for 1985 Komodo dragon effects,and a haggard looking Daniel Craig forced to sport a boot camp hair cut emphasizing his rather pronounced ears. At least they terminated the sour Judy Dench character. Time to retire Craig, and the producers.

B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Kanye West get's together with Rick Ruben and creates a master piece of a album that in my opinion has pushed the envelope the way rappers used to do. Now a days all the beats sound the same and people are settling for radio singles and moving on. This is a amazing body of work crushed into only 10 amazing tracks. Most of the time 10 tracks is not near enough for me to judge a artist or album for that matter but this album leaves my ear drums satisfied. Kanye has a ton of haters so people are going to go into this album with there minds made up already but I'm a fan and I can't stop listening to this album.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|J.Cole will never get into that elite level until he lets someone else make a beat for him. All the beats sounds the same to me, and it pisses me off that I know he has more potential but he is in that comfort zone of making beats for himself. I cant give him 5 stars on this album honestly, not even close to Kanye as far as production but every album he is getting better
B00006JU7T|5.0|I watched this on DVD and I think that Al Pacino gave a stunning performance as Frank Serpico, an honest NYPD officer who gets mistreated by other officers who bribe him money that were taken away by criminals. But, Serpico keeps saying \\"No\\" to them, which is a wise thing to do. I am also happy that Serpico stopped at nothing to bring the bad NYPD officers to jail and restore order.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am a big fan of science fiction, but for some reason had never read this book. It did not disappoint. It was fantastic. It is a terrific book for young adult readers, but even though I am out of the target demographic, I had a lot of fun and thought provoking moments reading this book.<br />This is also the very first book I read on my Kindle. I am a huge defender and lover of the printed page. I love all the tactile sensations of a paper book, and was extremely skeptical about reading an ebook. I finally was convinced to try it because of the convenience factor of being able to bring several books in my bag without having to lug around several books. Ender's Game was the first ebook I read, and it made me see not only that ebooks are not the horrible invention I thought they were, but also that they can offer a benefit over an actual live book.<br />I will not reveal any details of the end of the book to those who have not read it, but let's just say that the ending is one that you don't see coming if you don't know how many pages are left at the end of the book. With an actual book, the physical presence of the pages you hold in your right hand while reading, help indicate how much of the book there is left, and thus affects your perception of when the ending is coming and how that might relate to the plot of the story. When I read Ender's Game on my Kindle, I did not know how many pages were left, and thus didn't see the turns the plot was going to take. It was an experience in reading that I had never had before.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved this book very well written could\\"nt  put it down  very good story told my mom to read it she loved it too.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I strongly dislike this update. I don't like that you have to sign up. I could not connect with others.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I heard one of the songs on this album on the radio and felt like playing the whole album.  I was sure I had it in my collection and when I went to look for it,  to my surprise,  I couldn't find it.  It was an immediate purchase.  8 great songs.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved this game!! I hope there are more to come soon!! I only wish it had been longer so I could play more!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Love the special effects.  Thanks for having it free to watch on Prime.  About to make another selection to watch.
1616550414|4.0|The quality of the paper and the cover is top-notch. It's really a must-have for all Zelda fans that love to look deeper in the process and the making of the games. The manga section also expands a bit the story before the Skyward Sword event.
B0073ODRKG|5.0|A wonderful collection all easily accessable in one place.  Has many songs that were not big hits, but totally great songs.

I also realized I am playing a good game and I don't need my cc right next to me lol ... Most def recommend app - might even consider paying for a Great upgrade... MTC
B008NIS2SS|1.0|I should have known that $15 for 7 albums was a bit suspect. Only two of these albums have the complete tracks, that's the only reason I didn't return the whole set to Amazon. Some albums are missing one track, some several. To make it worse, some albums are split between two CDs, so even when you have a complete album you can't necessarily listen to the whole thing without changing CDs, the albums are worthless unless you're going to put them on your iPod. If that wasn't enough, there is absolutely NO indication on any CD of what's in it -- it just reads &#34;CD1&#34;, &#34;CD2&#34;, etc. Buyer beware!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. I don't like the pop-ups trying to get me to log into Facebook but that's what you get for a free game.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Not only very well written and researched but quite different and unique.  You can't help think about how we take our freedom for granted & how difficult it must be to live in a dictatorship.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|He has issues!!  But, the story was hot and intimately sexy! Although it is graphically erotic, I thought it was a great love story.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Well, it did not play out how I expected and maybe that is why I liked it. However, I found myself upset and frustrated many times throughout the story (I would say more, but it would give the story away). But in the end it is rapped up the way it should. However, it seems there could be another book about what happens next in their lives and their society, but I probably wouldn't read it.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|In my opinion the best album,he ever did,and with the dvd included of the,videos for Billie Jean,Beat It and Thriller and it even better.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh my God.this is so not the end! Please tell me the 4th book is coming out in the next two months ... I can't keep waiting for the amazing ending of this story..
B00395ZYVS|4.0|A good story filled with lessons of life.  The author tries to insert too much emotion at the end with mixed results, however.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Book had everything I wanted except a cliffhanger at the end. Nothing at the end to keep me begging for more.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Great book, funny and smart. With lots of twists, unpredictable ending (really, you'd never guess how it ends even after the first half, believe me on that). It just soaks you in. And I'm not a big thriller fun, quite opposite. I'd never go for thriller normally, its a bit shallow.  But not this one. Totally worth it!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|If your wife/gf likes chick flicks, then you can earn some brownie points here. This movie had some actual suspense, a decent story line, and the actress is actually pretty hot. My wife wanted to watch this, and I was surprised that it wasn't that bad. After watching The Lucky One with Zach Effron, I was expecting the worst. This one was MUCH better, and I have to say I enjoyed it ok.
B000FA57US|5.0|You can't get films these days that can compete to the horror films from back in the day. It is all digital and it does not look real. Even the new Halloween movies are lame. But I will say that this one is a must see. It looks better in DVD than it did in VHS. You are scared throughout the whole movie.

B00BNPWBOO|5.0|In the 90's Primal Scream were just untouchable, releasing groundbreaking album after another, but then the quality started to dip, perhaps the band had burned themselves out, or they'd settled down to raise families & there priorities had changed.<br />Whatever the reasons, PS released a series of, not bad records, but just a little disappointing (there was a time when the release of a new PR was a mayor musical event) compared to albums like \\"Xtrmntor\\" or \\"Vanishing Point\\".<br />So we arrive at \\"More Light\\", that sees the band completely rejuvenated, creating an epic & eclectic masterpiece.<br />Mixing a whole load of styles & moods, from soul to swirling densely packed psychedelics, Moroccan drone, a bit of David Lynch & the obligatory Stones track (obviously!), although after the \\"Screamdelica\\" tour I thought the album would be a lot more dance orientated.<br />Theirs is quite a lot of sax played throughout the record that adds a little bit of depth & atmosphere to the music. Gillespie's vocals (he sings on every track) are pretty strong as well, which can't be said for every PR album.<br />This album certainly maintains your interested throughout, & by the end your certainly feel your been on a fascinating musical journey.<br />As for the deluxe version of the album, the extra tracks are good, a little looser & atmospheric. None of they are quite strong enough to make the original record (which is probably why there extra tracks!) but are defiantly worth paying the extra for. The Andy Weatherall remix of \\"2013\\" is a bit pointless, you would have thought he'd had a stab at \\"It's alright, it's OK\\", perhaps he didn't think lightning would strike twice after the success of \\"Loaded\\"<br />So believe the hype, this is PR's strongest record since \\"Xtrmntor\\" & an early runner for best album of 2013.<br />Although I don't know what type of flower Mr Gillespie would make, quite a grumpy one me thinks.
B00005O438|4.0|This is a classic horror film. I was watching critters and I remember that Cujo is referenced in the movie. I had not seen it in a long time and you can't get it at blockbuster anymore. Believe me, I tried. I would recommend this movie. It is suspenseful to where you are trying to yell out to the characters if you know what I mean. ; )
B00CWY76CC|5.0|bring on more and keep the challenges coming. Keeps your interest floor by floor. Could play for hours if it kept going.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Quirky, with a few pop culture and boomer references.  Light and harmless.  Requisite kick in the crotch scene.  Good enough.
B00CELB94E|4.0|You could argue that this is Beady Eye's first proper album, as most of the songs on \\"Different Gear..\\" were written while Oasis still excised. So it is defiantly interesting to hear their new songs, without the influence (all be it however small) of Liam's Brother.<br />It's interesting that the band complained that they rush released their first record, with a lot of the songs needed more work, but sometimes that's not such a bad thing, it gives the music a much more spontaneous & breezy feel to it.<br />Which could be one of the problems with \\"Be\\", perhaps the band have over thought some of the music, instead of going by their gut feeling.<br />So what you hear is a bit of a mixed bag, there are some great tracks on this CD, such as \\"Flick of the Finger\\" & \\"Don't Brother me\\" with Liam delivering a more restrained vocal performance. But there is also some songs that you've heard Oasis do quite a few times already & you get the feeling there're treading water just a bit.<br />The extra tracks are fine, highlights being the ballad \\"Off the next exit\\" & the Oasis-Be Here Now-period \\"The World's not set in Stone\\".<br />What I enjoyed so much about \\"Different Gear..\\" is that the record built up a great momentum that didn't let up till the album was done, but with \\"BE\\" there are some strong well crafted tracks, it just a little hit & miss.<br />I get the feel that Beady Eye have hit there creative ceiling, don't get me wrong it's quite a high ceiling, but I think this is a good as it's going to get.<br />So a good solid Indie rock album, it not going to turn the music world on it's axis, but it will do.

B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Yes, you must see this movie if you're wondering which movie to pick.  This is how Oz became Oz the wizard. Cute flick.  No nit-picking this film.  Great casting, HD & audio effects crisp to sight & sound. Renting film was without a digital hitch. Stream from phone's hotspot.  Did prior have connection issue's,  in the past. Replaced battery & bought a wilson cell signal booster,, Watching with max signal connection makes a difference.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Released in Bond's fiftieth year, SKYFALL contains all those elements you'd expect from a Bond film - car chases, really bad baddies, witty ripostes, the obligatory sex scene and exotic locations.  To be honest, the locations are a little spurious in this film - Istanbul, Shanghai, Macau; the Istanbul scenes, in particular, seem orientalist in conception (after two decades of living in the Republic of Turkey), I've yet to find scenes of daily life with the continual strains of the muezzin in the background accompanied by arabesk music).  However the film is redeemed by a close focus on characterization: we learn a lot about Bond's relationship to M (Judi Dench), and how the bad guy (Javier Bardem) finds that he has no choice other than to kill her.  There's also some interesting material on the nature of family: M is considered a 'mother-figure' within the British Secret Service, suggesting that work and leisure are inextricable.  Daniel Craig is a rugged Bond, making no secret of his advancing years: the film has an interesting side-line, as it speculates on whether spying these days is a young person's game.  All in all, a very satisfying piece of entertainment.

B000VSAEYI|5.0|First off I want to say I spent several hours researching kiddie pools and this one seemed to have the least negative reviews so I took a chance... We bought it for my daughter's first birthday knowing we'd have a bunch of young kids to entertain and it ended up being a huge hit!! We had five kids playing it it who were around a year old. They LOVED the sea animals on the bottom of the pool and the inflatable toys that come with it are fun even out of the pool! The water depth is just right for young kids and the little water spouts on the sides (which you can turn off or on) made the kids giggle! We had two older kids playing in it after the babies got out, and although they weren't able to use the slide properly they did lounge on it and have fun anyways! We used an air pump from our air mattress to inflate it and it is also easy to drain this pool also which is very important. With the reviews I was nervous about finding holes but we have not had any problems, it is still very well inflated after 3 days! I would buy this pool again if something ever happened to it. GREAT BUY!!!
B00514HDNW|5.0|I wish I could give it more stars.  I can see why it was made into a movie multiple times.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very good read.  You feel like you are living the story through the father.  Praying it will never be your story.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I always get lost in Hosseini's characters and this is no different. The disjointed story telling left me with less of a connection than previously, but it was nonetheless an enjoyable read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|awesome game i really want to get more games like this. i like how it is super mind boggling and trick
B000VDDDY6|5.0|It came in a great condition and it was cheap for what I got. I would recommend this to anyone.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is a cute game. Easy enough for young children, but still fun for adults. I like how easy it is to earn money. You also need acorns for some stuff, they can be purchased with real money. However, you don't have to. You are given several  chances each time you play to earn them on your own. I play these games a lot, and almost all of these kinds of games force you to spend money or you can't proceed.  The great thing about  this game is you are not forced to buy anything.  Also, this same company makes the game Epic. It is  very fun. One of my favorites!!
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|The multiplayer mode is decent other than guns being outrageously expensive and there's always one player who dominates a game.<br /><br />My biggest issue is the campaign. The dialogue is cringeworthy. All the characters are cliche, overdone a million times in other things. I got halfway before calling it quits so that I wouldn't break my Kindle in frustration.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Love the funky feel of this, and Nile Rodger's guitar... Pharrel's voice is excellent too. My favourite track so far this year.
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|Let me start by saying I am happy that AIC are back for more and that they are still making music, I've been a fan since the band emerged over 20 yrs ago.<br />I am a Diehard metal fan, but always enjoyed the \\"Grunge\\" aspect of AIC who were very influenced by Sabbath and such. I find this album to be more \\"Matured effort\\"<br />a mix of \\"Jar Of Flies\\" and some of the heavier sounds. A nice combo if you asked me. And I dont see the problem with the mix of the album the production seems fine to me?<br />anyhow some of the standouts on the new album are as follows:<br /><br />Hollow<br />Stone<br />Voices ( This song could have been on \\"Jar Of Flies\\")<br />The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here<br />Scalpel ( Another Acoustic Gem)<br />Phantom Limb<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and give it a few spins ( yeah I know im old) I think you'll appreciate the album .<br /><br />May AIC Live on another 20 yrs!
1583334386|5.0|Kelly McGonigal's \\"The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do To Get More of It\\" explains both the psychology and physiology of willpower.  McDonigal uses clear language and vivid examples for translating powerful, research-proven, empirically validated concepts into comprehendible language and applicable exercises.<br /><br />With her enjoyable (often conversational and entertaining) writing style, McGonigal informs our brains and also endears our hearts with sufficient knowledge and enthusiasm to nurture our self-confidence that we can master our willpower and change ourselves to become how we want to be.  Beyond developing our own willpower, McDonigal presents many concepts that are the fundamental underpinnings of Behavioral Economics.<br /><br />While an interesting book, \\"The Willpower Instinct\\" seems more intended for actual application in our own everyday lives rather than simply reading and understanding.  In reflective \\"Under the Microscope\\" exercises, McDonigal challenges us to look at how the described concepts already play-out in our current life experiences.  In direct \\"Willpower Experiments\\", McDonigal challenges safe exploratory exercises for integrating Willpower Tools into our behavioral repertoires.  \\"Notice how you're struggling now, consider what you could be doing to succeed more\\" ... consider reading \\"The Willpower Instinct\\"  and start your journey toward greater satisfaction and fulfillment.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|I chose this rating because of the extraordinary way it is written. I liked everything about this book. I cannot wait to read the second one! I would recommend this book to anyone twelve years or older.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book because the author does an excellent job of making the characters' points of view so clear. I felt the emotions that they were feeling, and I was able to see their situation from theirs eyes instead of my own. That is such a difficult thing to do. I love books that are able to achieve that. I have read other books by this author that I did not like as much, but this one was very powerful! I couldn't pout it down.
0345472322|4.0|Carol Dweck's very interesting \\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\\" could be both required reading for MBA programs and also prerequisite reading for all parents.<br /><br />Dweck's examples, from extensive research, show that much of what we've previously (and conveniently) grown to believe about intelligence and motivation is simply misguided ... and perhaps inadvertently debilitating.  Though perhaps a challenging read due to the extensive research details, often we need reliable proof (as provided by research) before we will entertain considerations of changing our deeper beliefs.  (One of Dweck's earlier books, \\"Self-Theories: Their Role in Motivation, Personality, and Development\\" describes in greater detail many of the research initiatives that are foundational to her theory of Mindsets.)<br /><br />While Dweck's concepts of Fixed and Growth Mindsets are initially about Intelligence Mindsets, these Intelligence Mindsets also underpin concepts of external and internal motivation as well.  If you're leading adults in the workplace or children in the home, if you're working to master your own life or supporting your friends in their pursuits, \\"Mindset: The New Psychology of Success\\" will give you powerful tools to help you with your challenge.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was great! Puzzles were creative and fun. I only wish it was longer. Too less then a day to complete but for the quality of game play, it was well worth the price. I hope they make a sequel or game update asap!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|My son loves these movies, and this was a great deal for all three!  The packaging inside is good, but my son has already squashed the outer packaging.  No big deal, they were rarely inside it anyway.
B0041KVV8U|1.0|Great music by the Beatles, but, record executives don't get it. We don't want analog music converted to digital and then back to analog for use on vinyl LP's. It defeats the purpose of using analog tapes and the results on vinyl  sound just like a CD. All the 3 dimensional, warm, rich sound of analog vinyl is gone. These executives must be the like the executives in the 1970's who thought it was a good idea to use cheap bendable vinyl and then shrink wrap it, guarantying warps right out of the package. They almost killed the medium in the 70's, a medium that has far better sound than a CD. Apple and other manufacturers are out of touch with what their customers' want. If they want to digitize why not put albums (music only) out on BlueRay? At least then some audiophiles might then be happy with digitized music. Instead record companies continue to use the lowest medium for digital music: CD's. Why don't people buy CD's? Sound matters. ADDENDUM: In 2014, Apple/EMI issued Mono Masters that are not digitized in any way. I bought them all and I am extremely satisfied with the all analog sound.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|After being a Hanson fan since 1997 I've not LOVED everything they have ever done.  In fact, I was not in love with \\"Shout It Out\\", but being a fan, I always manage to like enough to continuously support this amazing, underrated band.<br /><br />I'm still floored at the obvious growth and change that I see in \\"Anthem\\" from the last album.  The lyrics have improved (my biggest problem with SIO). the music is infectious...still Hanson, but better, louder, rockier.  This album will sound AMAZING live, and I think they put a lot of thought into that when they were making the album.  I can't wait to experience some of the new music at a concert either, that is where I feel they are absolutely at their best.<br /><br />I don't think I've loved an album THIS MUCH since TTA, but here we are with Anthem where I just can't imagine skipping a song! It's been years since I've done that!  Of course there are some songs I don't love as much as others, but I can still appreciate aspects of every song. For example, songs like \\"Scream and Be Free\\" just misses a little something for me, but there is a lot of the song I do really like.<br /><br />One thing I have always loved about Hanson is that I do see them pushing themselves as artists, but still holding true to the essence that has made them great for so many years.<br /><br />Some Favorites: \\"Lost Without You\\", \\"Juliet\\", \\"Tragic Symphony\\", \\"Already Home\\"<br /><br />I'm proud to be a fan.

B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Terrible action sequences, completely boring and uninspired villains, wooden lazy acting by almost everyone, and cringe-worthy dialogue.  This makes Die Hard 2 and 4 look genius by comparison, and shouldn't even be mentioned alongside the wonderful 1 and 3.  Awful.  Awful.  Awful.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|A marvelous film superbly acted. I often stop watching a movie long before the end, this one I couldn't turn off even to use the bathroom. I might add that I am around the age of the characters in this film, and while I have no desire to retire to India, I could and did entirely sympathize with them. I didn't hear a single false note and thought every character entirely believable in context. Maybe Maggie Smith overdid the insular Brit bigot early on - her attitude in the initial hospital scenes would not be accepted in any English hospital today - but she came around nicely as the film progressed. Highly recommended.
0783240287|5.0|OMG! I love this movie. It is so much fun and I can't stop smiling when I am watching it. My husband and I have seen this movie at least 10 times or more and some right in a row. If you have not seen this movie you need to get it right away.

B00DF0POXA|1.0|Aside from the obvious arrogance that is part of his persona, this music is difficult to listen to. It's not because of delicate sensibilities or because of the language he uses, it's the awful tracks themselves. Definitely more annoying than I was ready for, and the beats are off putting.

I think there's something about the wonky-wonk of the ragtime trumpet that cuts into the smoothness of unmistakable tracks of his like &#34;do the strand&#34; and &#34;virginia plain.&#34; In watching the film, it was like putting something knowable like Beyonce's &#34;crazy in love&#34; into a 20s dance party, it's not that it's totally out of place, it's just that it triggers memories not associated with the set piece it's in. so with Ferry.
0062255657|4.0|I'll start by saying that I'm not hugely familiar with Neil Gaiman's work. I've read [[ASIN:B000FC13Y0 Stardust]] and watched his two [[ASIN:B005M2A4D4 Doctor]] [[ASIN:B00C6ACVLI Who]] episodes... and that's it. At first I wasn't sure whether or not to absorb more of his work before tackling \\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\", but decided against it for the sake of a fresh perspective. So consider this a review from someone who has very few preconceptions about Gaiman's style and themes.<br /><br />Our middle-aged protagonist (I don't recall if we ever learn his name) recounts to us his movements after a family funeral. Instead of going to the wake he drives through Sussex to his childhood home where vague memories begin to stir. Going down a little country lane he arrives at the Hempstock family farmhouse, certain that he used to play with the family's young daughter Lettie. At the back of the property is a pond that Lettie once claimed was an ocean, though this never made sense to him as a boy. But now, standing there, he begins to remember...<br /><br />This prologue leads into the story proper. We're taken back to the boy's childhood, on the day when his beloved kitten was run over by an opal miner, learning through his narration that he has few friends, a rather distant relationship with his parents, and spends most of his time reading books. But the suicide of the coal miner begins a domino effect of strange and often frightening supernatural occurrences that throw our young narrator into grave danger, within his home as well as without. He can only be saved from his horror by the three mysterious women living on Hempstock farm.<br /><br />To be honest, I don't really want to go into too much detail regarding the plot for fear of ruining some of the surprises in store. I read it with no foreknowledge whatsoever about what it was about and enjoyed the story all the more for it. It's better to talk about how the book made me feel.<br /><br />\\"The Ocean at the End of the Lane\\", more so than any other book I've read in recent memory, really recaptured what it was like to be a child. Gaiman expertly encapsulates the wonder, the terror, the powerlessness of what it is to be a seven year old; how adults can be care-givers but also jail-wardens, how things that we take for granted as an adult make absolutely no sense to a child, and how anything bizarre can be taken in stride but everyday things such as relationships and careers and finances can be utterly terrifying.<br /><br />It actually brought back memories of my own childhood: the way food seemed to taste so much better, the joy of being warm and dry after being cold and wet, the absurdity of taking the main road to get somewhere when I knew a dozen short-cuts, and of course the wisdom and knowledge and comfort that could be gleaned from books. This really is a book written from a child's perspective, for we are shown things through the boy's eyes that make no sense to him, though we understand exactly what they are. Alternately, the framing device of the adult narrator also means that he can provide plenty of insight into the way children think. For example: \\"small children believe themselves to be gods, or some of them do, and they can only be satisfied when the rest of the world goes along with their way of seeing things\\" or \\"my parents were a unit, inviolate\\" or \\"she was every monster, every witch, every nightmare made flesh; she was also an adult, and when adults fight children, adults always win.\\"<br /><br />Gaiman isn't afraid to portray the dark side of childhood as well as its delights, and the supernatural qualities of the storyline emphasis this theme. Also explored is the mutability of memory. Because the entire story is told from the point-of-view of a grown man looking back on his childhood several questions are raised about the accuracy and nature of his reminiscence. How much are we shaped by what we remember? Who do we become if we forget things?<br /><br/>Finally, what I loved most about the plot was the way that several bizarre occurrences and arrivals took place without any immediate explanations. It really hooks the reader and gives the entire story a sense of depth and mystery and terror (after all, the most frightening thing in the world is the unknown). Like peeling back layers, only with each layer being more expansive than the one before, we learn more about the source of all the trouble only gradually. It reminded very much of the way Diana Wynne Jones writes her stories ([[ASIN:0006755283 Black Maria]] in particular) and of Hayao Miyazaki's ability to instil the portrayal of an ordinary childhood rife with unexplained creatures and diminishing boundaries between us and another world.<br /><br />It's definitely a must-read for me, and will no doubt spur me into checking out more of Gaiman's work./>Finally, what I loved most about the plot was the way that several bizarre occurrences and arrivals took place without any immediate explanations.

B004V7EXO2|4.0|I've always enjoyed Paul Simon's work. My parents played Simon and Garfunkel often growing up, I found the Graceland CD purely by accident once and it's one of my favorites. After hearing &#34;The Afterlife&#34; on my local indie radio station, I picked up this album.<br /><br />I never fully understood what drew me to Paul Simon's music until reading a Rolling Stone article about him. He said &#34;It's all about the sound&#34;. The way he uses different instruments, the differing production sounds, it makes for a unique sound. Think about &#34;You Can Call Me Al&#34;? Yes, Graceland was a different kind of album, but the musical styling and sounds from the album are somewhat present in So Beautiful. Not every song is a winner, but the title track, &#34;The Afterlife&#34; and &#34;Getting Ready for Christmas Day&#34; are good examples of the rather eclectic Simon sound.<br /><br />I'm no critic, I just like what I hear. And I like this album. If you like Graceland, you should get this one too.
0812993292|4.0|I admit, it started slow and i had a hard time wanting to keep picking it up to continue.  But somewhere midway it just engulfed me.  This was more a story about a man and wife who realized before it was too late how much they meant to each other more than a story about a walk, in my opinion.  Even though I loved his journey - his pilgramage - and it was a delightful way to keep my interest since I am very respectful of people who can do long treks like that on foot and it fascinates me -  It was more about a depiction of two people who had become so bitter over hardships that they simply stopped living life, until Harold decided to take his journey that is.<br /><br />Not a cliff hanger, no frills to keep you turning the page, but a delightful novel that I am very glad I decided to buy and read.  Near the ending I was so moved I had to keep tissues nearby.  Perhaps it was seeing myself so close (well about 20 years away, so not very close) to their own age and knowing full well that the sort of misery and sadness that they experienced is far too easy for any couples to experience made me rejoice in the fact that they learned to laugh again. For me that was the sweetest part of the book. Harold and &#34;maw&#34; laughing together again like they did when they first met.  Harold Fry was such an ordinary little older man that is probably living in every little neighborhood in not only england but the US too.  I am sure there are many Harold's and Maureen's in many households in similar debacles.  So many fathers who were quiet in word and never really spilled their heart much like Harold in familial situations-certainly a familiar thing for many men.  But Harold was able to overcome his woes and did it in such an endearing manner all who read upon him must have felt affection for this loveable little guy who decided to DO SOMETHING other than wasting away on his couch.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars for the slow start, but even that wasn't that bad. Not all goodbooks that I have read started off incredibly strong.  For me, ending incredibly strong makes it very forgiving.
0425263924|5.0|I had pre-ordered this book to arrive at my holiday destination on it's release date...and I was happily surprised that it arrived 1 day early!!!  Amazon rocks!!!  I finished the much anticipated Book 3 around 5 am the next morning.  Could not put it down!!!  The evolution of Gideon and Eva as a couple was refreshing after the anxiety of Book 2, and the good news is--- the author still has many stories left unfinished for a Book 4.  Amazon AND Sylvia exceeded my expectations!!!

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I have loved these books- even reread the first 2 before this one ready to finish this series only to be left hanging once again!  There was soo much focus on other characters in this book made me think author was priming for a spin off series.  And what was done to Eva in this book- she loves Gideon but you make her seem like a heartless slut with the Brett thing- REALLY!  And Gideon with his ex- the man can't tell her to take a hike really? I feel like it was drama just for the sake of filling pages<br /><br />I left to assume that we will have to wait another 6 to 8 months for the next book- and we can only hope it really is the final book of this series.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Well written - well acted - well done movie.  Based on Lt. Col. Hal Moore, his US Air Cavalry unit, and a journalist in the Vietnam war.  I liked this movie very much as it came across as a realistic telling of the true experiences of soldiers and on-the-ground combat in Norrth Vietman - sobering and to be remembered.  It wasn't too Hollywood and seemed without polical slant.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is a totally awesome game!the thing that intrigues me the most is that you can discover all kinds of different dragons! And they're all basically based off of the basic ones! So all you have to do is raise those and then you'll have a totally awesome rare Dragon for a smaller cost instead for a ton of gold. But it take time. it's very hard to describe this game so I suggest you try it out for yourself!I hope this review helpful!

B00D2HTRVQ|1.0|We have all the panda games and love them, but this one appears to have a problem when it tries to do the 'high five' part. The panda and his paw flicker but aren't really visible, so there is no way to continue the game. Sometimes if you touch the screen where the paw should be the game continues ok, but you have to be quick. Please fix. This one looks really cute. The iPad version doesn't have this problem.<br /><br />Update: As I tried to play with it more, I got to the point where the game would flat-out crash every time even when there was no \\"Panda high-five\\" involved.  There is no way I could give to to my kids to play with, which was the whole reason I bought this game in the first place.  Then I noticed that while the Amazon version is 1.1, the version on Google Play is 1.3 from 6/18.  WTH?!?  Interestingly, before the most recent update, most of the reviews on Goggle Play say it doesn't work.  Hopefully one day at least one of these updates will make it to Amazon so I can improve my rating of this game.
B000IEXVCC|4.0|At the end you will see that this movie was never what you expected. Excellent film noir. Good addition to my collection.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I adore Stephen King and I've read most of his books.  This is my favorite one by far.  I couldn't put it down.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|A psychological thriller that pulls you in and doesn't let go.<br />Until the unpredictable end. Wowee, I never saw that coming.
0545265355|5.0|I love all three books and I just bought this to add to my collection. The story is depressing in general but I enjoyed the progression of the story. Without giving anything away, I feel that the heroine behaved as well as a teenager could in such a situation. The story was haunting and moving. I couldn't put the book down. Love it! I hope you enjoy all three books just as I did. But so sad.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|This band continues to blow me away. I was introduced to Sigur R&oacute;s only a year or so ago but quickly became a fan. Their music is phenomenally innovative and every time I listen to them I simply get lost in the beauty of it. It's not often you find an artist whose \\"sound\\" can move you emotionally. Sigur R&oacute;s already has a very respectable back catalog, but this release proves they have a lot more to offer and will only get better.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I LOVE this show.  I think my husband and I watched all the episodes within three days.  Will watch again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Great game, very fun and entertaining! Challenging and and makes you use your brain. Fun for all ages...Great to work with others on!
B001223BLU|5.0|This album is full of hits and very reasonably prices for the number of songs it includes. I loved it and the memories it brought back.
1932100660|5.0|After reading the book I was convinced. I had to change the way I was eating.<br />The so many questions I had were answered in this book.<br />I am now a complete vegan, and I do not do it for the animals, I do it for me, for my health. I feel great.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I love the actors and the plot twist. I actually watched it twice in a row since I rented it.  Now I want to buy it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This interesting film. Are there going to be films for the other books?  I would really like to see the complete series.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I absolutely love this app I play it everyday I can't praise it enough it is one of the better apps that I have gotten
B001TH16DI|5.0|There are some good extras, but nothing really spectacular. There needs to be an ultimate edition set put out, much like the Star Wars set.<br /><br />The extra disk with interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart and Frakes is awesome.
B00B10DZQE|5.0|Loved it and I am glad I bought it so we can watch it over and over! Really great movie!
B001KZG99A|4.0|Mr. Downey is a good (fun to watch) actor.  This is an adventure flick, I realize, but there are action flicks where the acting is not worth mentioning.  I found Mr. D and Ms. Paltrow very winning (even when they are obviously winking at us).  Movie quality is as good as expected.  Much LOUD effects and fantastic feats -- but, thankfully, not too too much gore nor graphic material.  This is my second experience using Amazon Prime and it (processing/delivery) has been quite nice.  Thanks much.
0399132635|5.0|I feel one of Koontz's best works.<br />I bought it because I wanted a hardcover copy having previously<br />read it.
0375842209|5.0|I was asked to choose a book to read for a book club in my high school English class, and as soon as I heard the description for this book, I knew I wanted to read it. However, after ordering this book I'd forgotten the premise, and as I started reading I was confused as to who the narrator was. The unusual choice of narrator created an intrigue and I wanted to keep reading. The story flowed pretty well, with just a little backtracking that wasn't annoying, just a little difficult to keep up with. The character development was great and made me feel like I actually knew each character (which made it that much harder to read the ending). I liked that the books gives a perspective on what it was like for both children and adults living in Nazi Germany, Jewish or not. The Book Thief is excellently written; it's a page-turner. I probably wouldn't re-read it, but I rarely do with any book. However, it does leave me wanting more! I really recommend this to anyone 13+ or younger advanced readers. Great read!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This app is awesome. This app makes it is so easy to make your pictures look beautiful and professional. I highly recommend it.
B004GYY714|4.0|This app does what it is supposed to for me, a simple user that just likes to listen to on-line music in the morning. As with many Android apps, there does not seem to be a way to close the app. Perhaps it happens automatically. Also, the programmers should make the deleting of stations easier. For some reason, many apps never consider users that would like to eliminate things.
0307888908|5.0|This book is a jump start, the CPR for anyone in todays' work force.  My husband and I pick it up from room to room. Terrific read - has been highly recommended to new graduates by us.  Thank you Mr. Hoffman.
1591396190|5.0|Kim and Maugorgne's Blue Ocean Strategy is an enthralling book about how to break through to a blue ocean market from the competitive red markets of today.  It uses several examples to explain each point provided. It provides the reader with Out-of-the-box ways of thinking.<br /><br />Blue Oceans are explained by comparing them to red oceans. Those red oceans are the competitive markets of today that are cut throat where as blue oceans are untapped markets and are created by using untraditional thinking.  Blue Oceans are created when both cost and structure of a company change to favorably affect its buyers.<br /><br />Kim and Maugorgne use examples such as NetJets, Cirque du Soleil, Starbucks, and Apple Computers to explain how people create blue ocean markets. They do not just focus on the competition in their markets but other leadership and innovation strategies that will help set them apart from other like companies. They offer things that others have not, focus on the customers rather than profits and use specific strategies to figure out how to set themselves apart.<br /><br />Blue Ocean gives descriptive and easy to understand directions on how to recreate your business strategy to better serve customers while increasing profits. It is insightful, an easy read, and captivating.
B005PWPUW6|3.0|My son said I needed this---I have no idea how it is working, or what it does.  Good I guess.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|No words can describe how much I liked this book. Just amazing and how many emotions you feel for these characters.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love this game...play when you can at a leisurely pace. Dinosaurs are great with graphics every time you evolve. If you're look looking for a fast paced, complete missions fast then not a game for you.
193700788X|1.0|I wasted my time and my money!  I been following this serie for years and I enjoyed all the books except this piece of s*** ! I am so fraking mad . I'm gonna burn it .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|....Really good. If you have the original you should get this. The funny thing is if you play this and you play the classic,it's weird. I'm an 11 year old boy and this interests me. You should get this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this game and my friend showed me it. It was so cool I had to wait a while till I got it it was hard for me at first but now im really good at and love the new update it has CAKE
B001RTSPVY|5.0|The first season didn't last long since it consists of 8 episodes so of course I had to order this one with it so I can see what happens. I have borrowed the first three seasons from a friend and downloaded the fourth (awaiting for the full season of 5 to come out now).<br /><br />What can I tell you about this show without ruining what happens to someone who has never seen it? I would explain it as the extended season of the first one. Walter White (the man on the right) and Jesse Pinkman (the one on the left) get kidnapped by the local drug lord, DEA gets on the ball on the search for the blue meth, and disputes of the family arise. All I can say that happens at the end is a valued turn of events as a person is introduced that covers throughout the next two seasons. From them cooking in a mobile home to producing a large quantity, this is a show where you want to get the next season halfway through watching the previous season since so much happens in a short time.
B004Y1WCDE|2.0|Play store version has been up to date for a while. Why can't you bring the amazon store in line. Bites to be using the old version just because I bought it from the amazon store.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Great book. Love the plot, characters and the magical land. It is very hard to put down. It keeps to guessing about what will happen to all the characters.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I wasted 30 bucks on this book! It was draggy and there were too many repetitions going on. Eva had been scared to accept his proposal and then, BOOM! Whatever happened to standing on her own feet and making it on her own? There was no ending. Yup! Left hanging! The cliffhanger wasn't even a cliffhanger. It ended poorly. Corrine reminded me of Christian Grey's sub from FSOG. There wasn't anything in this book to brag about at all! I was expecting something as good as the second book but was left with disappointment. Too bad I only finished reading the book yesterday and can't return the book! I've learnt my lesson. 30 bucks is a big deal for a book full of repetitions and no substance! No more Crossfire series for me!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The 2 things I really like about this app are: 1) the large clock display and 2) the white noise function. I don't really need an alarm clock or even a clock for that matter with this app. 5 stars from me

B00DF0POXA|4.0|Kanye West became famous for his tongue twisting rhymes, bombastic beats, and can't miss samples. Listen to \\"Slow Jamz,\\" listen to \\"Gold Digger,\\" listen to \\"All Falls Down\\" and the sounds just come at you. In \\"Yeezus\\" the 2013 album from Mr. West, he strips himself from the cloak of his production work and we are left with pure Kanye: petulantly arrogant, self-destructive and self-aggrandizing, recklessly hedonistic. \\"Yeezus\\" is all of those things, with the barest of production work behind it. In effect, it is a brutally honest Kanye Twitter rant.<br /><br />This is Kanye at his most profane. I definitely can't print the Top 5 vulgarities in an Amazon review - he talks about nuns, civil rights fists, and Sweet and Sour sauce in ways that would make Dr. Ruth blush. His last solo album, \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" overflowed with features. On \\"Yeezus\\" there are only a few other voices: the Nina Simone sample on \\"Blood On The Leaves\\" is touching and complacently nihilistic Chief Keef is a perfect fit for \\"Hold My Liquor.\\"<br /><br />Kanye is still Kanye. He's brashly contradictory, the guy that hates the excess even as he asks for more. And the excess is mostly what he raps about - the luxury cars, the success, and the women. This might not be the album you expected of him, the album with the singles and the booming samples and the radio hits. But the clever wordplay is still there, and the \\"I can't believe he's saying that\\" honesty. This is not the Kanye album of old, and some will say that Kanye rushed this, and that the stripped down tracks are an excuse for poor production work. For me Kanye has earned the pass where I will trust his vision and try to enjoy each album for what it is.<br /><br />Kanye has both been bashed and complimented for changing his vision. For me, this album feels like a confession. He pours out his worst emotions. While \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" had the same theme: that I'm here and I'm an jerk, it was adorned with epic beats on almost every track. The music behind \\"Yeezus\\" is much more primal, and so are the emotions.<br /><br />On \\"Yeezus\\" I feel Kanye is pouring everything out to work it all out. Why's he doing this? The easiest answer is because he was about to become a father (he does say \\"Got the kids and the wife life/But can't wake up from the night life\\" on \\"I'm In It\\"). A more complicated answer is that he is ready to put himself out there. In a recent interview with Jon Caramanica Kanye talks about how every album he's put out has been partially compromised with fulfilling a perception of what the album SHOULD be. He also says when you walk into an old man's house you see that the old man going at 100% - not holding anything back. That's what \\"Yeezus\\" is all about. Kanye West at 100%. It's \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" without the shine; it's just \\"My Dark Twisted Fantasy,\\" I guess.<br /><br />This album is summed up for me in one line on the album closer, \\"Bound 2.\\" He says he doesn't remember where he met his new woman. But after all, \\"Admitting is the first step/Ain't nobody perfect.\\" This is Kanye West, at 100%, admitting all his faults, and I trust Kanye enough to enjoy the ride because hey, ain't nobody perfect.

I love being a detective and figure or trying to anyway who is the culprit and when they will open their eyes and figure it out.  It was a very good movie and for a change not too much bad language and blood.
B000009EAD|5.0|Since the singer Matt Barlow enter in the band they started a solid collection of great HEAVY METAL albums, and this one is my favourite.... DARK SAGA, BURNT OFFERINGS and HORROR SHOW are great, but SOMETHING WICKED got my favourite ICED tunes like BURNING TIMES, DISCIPLES OF THE LIE, STAND ALONE, REAPING STONE and MY OWN SAVIOUR.....If you like METALLICA and IRON MAIDEN you should check ICED EARTH!!!!!
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I know this is suppose to be for season 4 of NCIS, but I have to say every season is not disappointing. The cast do a great job playing their characters and the characters are well written. My favorite is Mark Harmon and his character Gibbs. If you are like me who started watching from the middle go and rent or even buy NCIS from season 1 and you'll be hooked.

0399246665|1.0|This book has split pages so it's a matching game. That's a cute idea I suppose, but it doesn't work at all! The pages have been cut crooked so you cannot even turn the top page to the matching bottom page (and vice versa). Maybe if these were made with more quality control it would be a decent product, but as it is don't waste your money.

B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Kanye West is considered one of hip-hop's modern geniuses.  Why, because he continually surprises with each and every album.  His highly anticipated sixth solo effort, [[ASIN:B00DF0POXA Yeezus [Explicit]]] continues that consistent evolution.  Perhaps aside from [[ASIN:B001FBIPFA 808s & Heartbreak]], Yeezus is easily West's most unexpected and experimental album.  Many will be off-put by West's direction this go-round while others will find it triumphant and creative.  Ultimately, Yeezus lies somewhere between those two extremes.  It has its exceptional moments and while other moments lack some of the lyrical depth of past releases.  Regardless, Yeezus is another fine addition to the West discography, even when/if it falls short of the 'glory' of his best offerings.<br /><br />\\"On Sight\\" is the first signal that the listener is in for some kind of trip.  With 'in your face' electro production, the sound itself is completely unexpected.  While it makes you raise an eyebrow, given West's loft self-confidence and over-the-top personality, it actually suits him. After all, \\"Yeezy season [is]approaching\\".  \\"Black Skinhead\\" leads a trio of three juggernauts, all possessing a share of controversy.  The rock-n-roll drums are unexpected, but definitely suits the message and sentiment (\\"If I knew what I knew in the past / I would've been blacked out on your...\\"  After screaming \\"God\\" at the close of \\"Black Skinhead\\", he calls himself a 'god' on \\"I Am A God\\", taking nothing away from 'the man upstairs.' Aggressive and riled-up, West's rhymes are potent, not to mention some wild screams.  On the minimalist \\"New Slaves\\", Wests alludes to a bad place in history, making modern references (\\"You would've thought I had help / but they wasn't satisfied / unless I picked the cotton myself...\\") It's 'uncomfortable' perhaps, but shock value is right up West's alley.<br /><br />\\"Hold My Liquor\\" doesn't have the same latch as its predecessors, with West only sporting one verse (Chief Keef and Justin Vernon guest).  It's not 'bad' per se, but it doesn't feel like vintage West.  Things are better on \\"I'm in it\\", even if the subject matter is pretty simple and self-explanatory.  What makes \\"I'm In It\\" special is it is 'all over the place'.  Crazy, yet interesting, it makes perfect sense - for West that is.  \\"Blood On The Leaves\\" outdoes nearly (if not) everything else. West drenches himself in auto tune, but it works.  \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" has more of a signature Kanye West edge - employing a killer sample, emotional rhymes, and sick production work.  \\"Guilt Trip\\" follows, but has the near impossible task to follow-up the spirited \\"Blood on the Leaves\\".  It falls short, but it's ok.  Penultimate cut \\"Send It Up\\" is more notable, even if West's message isn't profound (pleasure).  \\"Bound 2\\" is a bit more traditional West, anchored by a sample and jubilant guest vocals by Charlie Wilson.  It can't touch \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" mind you, but it is an appropriate, solid closer.<br /><br />Is [[ASIN:B00DF0POXA Yeezus [Explicit]]] overhyped? A bit, but it shows that West doesn't allow himself to be boxed in as just one type of musician.  It doesn't reach the heights of his previous masterpiece [[ASIN:B003X2O6KW My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]], but face it, it would be difficult for anyone/anything to top that.  \\"Black Skinhead\\", \\"I Am A God\\", \\"New Slaves\\", and \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" are my favorites, as they standout the most.  Not perfect, but interesting, there is still plenty of magic within Yeezus.  4 stars.and Justin Vernon guest).  It's not 'bad' per se, but it doesn't feel like vintage West.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great series. While watching season 3 my teenage sons started watching and became fans as well. Gotta love Maggie Smith!
0763644765|4.0|I thought this book was rather cute, and my child was nearing 2 years. I didn't expect it to be an in-depth how-to for my toddler, though apparently some reviewers did. I expected what I got: a very simple book to amuse my child about a topic we've been talking about.<br />This book is now kept in the car, as it's one of his favorites to look at during short car trips around town. We have many books for him, ranging from picture books to full stories, and his dad reads to him nearly every night as their part of the bedtime routine. This is the only \\"potty book\\" we have, as it's not exactly something they'll learn from a book, but it's amusing and entertains him.
B00CU8OVIM|4.0|J. Cole made the release date of June 18, 2013 even sweeter by releasing his highly anticipated effort [[ASIN:B00CU8OVIM Born Sinner (Deluxe Edition)]] the same day as Kanye West and Mac Miller's new efforts.  While West's [[ASIN:B00DF0POXA Yeezus [Explicit]]] is receiving the most buzz, perhaps J. Cole should be receiving equal, if not more 'love'.  Born Sinner is an exceptional follow-up to J. Cole's debut effort, [[ASIN:B005C9WA20 Cole World: The Sideline Story]], one of 2011's best album.  Intellectual and bold throughout, Cole's lyricism shows growth; he was already 'killing it'.<br /><br />\\"Villuminati\\" opens, chocked full to the brim with allusions and brainy rhymes.  It may be a bit heady to open, but it successfully shows Cole's skill.  Criticizing what Cole considers falsehoods of televangelism (and perhaps the church itself) is \\"Kerney Sermon (Skit)\\", in which pastor Kerney Thomas advertises a Prayer Package meant to 'heal' hardships, etc.  He follows up the skit with \\"Land of the Snakes\\", a cut in which he reminisces on his past, particularly his own hardships and a regrettable one-night stand.  Remaining focused, Cole does not disappoint in the least.  On the ubiquitous promo single \\"Power Trip\\",  Cole continues to impress, as he suggests his girl has \\"Got me up all night, all I'm singing is love songs...\\" Overt about his feelings, Cole claims \\"...this has gotta be the longest crush ever...\\" while his partner in crime Miguel just 'wants you to want him.'  After the love is gone, \\"Mo Money (Interlude)\\" proceeds, with J. Cole rapping about his previous lack of money and his 'come up'.<br /><br />If \\"Mo Money\\" causes problems, then the superb \\"Trouble\\" is the reaction and effect.  The MC is all about real talk, accompanied by a relatively simple buttressing beat and a soulful sounding gospel choir.  On \\"Runaway\\",  Cole claims \\"The devil got his hands on me...\\", again alluding to his sins/vices, which seem to be women, as he brags about the 'notches on his belt' compared to teen heartthrob Justin Bieber.  His issues continue on \\"She Knows\\", featuring Amber Coffman, in which he alludes to MLK, Jr.'s 'womanizing,' going so far to acknowledge Coretta's knowledge of it.  Maybe it's insensitive, but as Cole suggests at the beginning of the album, \\"it's way darker this time.\\"  He's angered on \\"Rich N****\\" claiming hardship will make you do things you don't want to or shouldn't do.  He misses choir practice on \\"Where's Jermaine? (Skit)\\", only to partake of the \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" with standout colleague, Kendrick Lamar.  Jazzy, magical, and completely distinct compared to his previous work, \\"Forbidden Fruit\\" begs for repeated listens.<br /><br />On \\"Chaining Day\\", while the 'obvious' impropriety that Cole raps about is his overindulgence for Jesus pieces, the bigger picture is materialism in general.  While he claims his current Jesus piece is his last, he 'back steps' on \\"Ain't That Some S***\\" (\\"OK I lied...\\"), in which he commits every perceived sin he can.

B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Amazing and unique band. A great varietry of metal that is well written as well as produced. Don't think just buy it.
B008220C38|1.0|So many have agreed with me.  Keira Knightly does best in the other roles she has had...&#34;Pride and &#34;Prejudice&#34; was outstanding!  She played well with Johnny Depp in &#34;Pirates of the Caribbean&#34;.<br /><br />But not Anna Karenina!  It was horrible!  She did not look right in it and the acting was awful.  A better actress for this movie would have been Katherine Zeta-Jones.  She would have brought the right amount of passion and desperation that the heroine in the novel actually possessed.<br /><br />Bad choice.  Nothing against Keira...but she was mis-casted in this movie.

B000EWD1KK|5.0|This is a great old movie! Really showcases Danny Kaye's MANY talents.  Hard to find old Danny Kaye movies as his wife has limited the releases and many are out of print. Such as fun movie with Virginia Mayo getting in on the fun - Danny plays Walter Mitty  - a book editor who is constantly in trouble for daydreaming as he puts himself in the middle of each book he is reading - naturally as its hero! But things get interesting when reality intrudes with daydreaming and he actually ends up in the middle of a great and mysterious adventure. Of course it all works out in the end. Best scene: the hatmaker!!!

0553801473|3.0|I'm too deep into the series to stop now, but this book is exceptionally long. Nothing really compares to the earlier books. A lot of Dance of Dragons is tedious, drawn out traveling between, or various endless cycles of kidnappings. If you made it this far, I can't stop you, but there's nothing very thrilling about this entry.

I found this a great read and it was the fastest I've read a book in a long time.<br /><br />It should have a 16+ rating though as I wouldn't let my 9 year read this book as I know lots of her friends have which I find a little disturbing.

B00CU8OVIM|5.0|Call me silly but this album is outshining over the hype that was Yeezus.  I'm a fan of both of them but this is hip hop.  The lyrics are telling and they are relative.  It's not juvenile like the lyrics Kanye decided to spit on a lot of the Yeezus tracks.  Also the production value of the tracks were manicured showing an integrity to the value of the music and the emphasis to the lyrics to the track.  It's not trashy or degrading but speaking in a smart mannerism to the prose.  Been a fan but this album is making me a believer of the future of hip hop.  Also, this LP needs to be put on vinyl.  It needs to be in my elitist collection.  Damn.

0345803485|1.0|Okay, I honestly try to give books a fair chance.<br /><br />However, Shades of Grey made it really hard for me.<br /><br />I only read two chapters and I wanted to read more, I really did but I just couldn't. The problem? The main character.<br /><br />At first, I thought I was going to like Ana but she has a big problem: she's shallow.  Half of the first two chapters is her talking about how handsome this Grey person is.  I get it! He's a modern day Adonis! Change the subject please!<br /><br />I might try again but if you're a person who needs a bit more in a book, I suggest trying something else

B00007GZR5|5.0|This film is a most fascinating depiction of the possible reality of life beyond this life. While I do not personally believe in an after life of any type of hell, I do see the truth of the hell people create for themselves and others on this planet now.<br />Jesus Christ himself said that &#34;The kingdom of God is within you.&#34; It stands to reason that so is Hell.<br />My favorite scene is when Robin William's character finds his wife in her hell and tries to connect with her. The dialogue that comes out of his mouth is absolute truth!<br />In our world culture, men are taught not to feel anything that is less than wonderful.- with the exception of anger. The sad result is the frustration of inability to connect with others, especially the opposite sex, emotionally.<br />When Robin's character decides it's better to live in hell with the one he loves than live in heaven without her, he takes the plunge, the risk of being doomed to hell forever, only to find that that is the only way his wife can FEEL his love, which empowers her to come out of her hell.<br />Oh if every man could watch that film and wake up to the meaning and abiltiy to connect with others on an emotional level, they would find that they can leave hell and enter into heaven in their relationships.  Not everyone is willing, nor necessarily able, yet many could have a much different life experience if they learned the lessons that Robin's character was able to learn.<br />I could go on and on...... Excellent story. Very much true in the concepts depicted. Robin is an excellent actor. So are the others.

0143122916|5.0|I saw a story online about this topic and knew right away I would be interested in the book.  It is a short book but it gives alot of insight into the backward way North Korea operates.  The first half of the story talks about Shin's life in the labor camp, his relationships (or lack thereof) with his family, his daily life, his jobs, his mistreatment.  So the first half is kind of what I was expecting.  The 2nd half of the book deals with his escape and struggle to fit into a free society that is totally foreign to him.  This part was interesting because it didn't have the typical happy ending you might expect.  It's unexpected because you would assume anyone who escapes North Korea would act like they're living in paradise once they get to a free country.  However Shin, like many ex-North Koreans, has a difficult time adjusting life once he escapes.  He has trouble holding a job, he can't support himself, he has trouble developing relationships with people, he feels guilt about all those he left behind in the camp who are still suffering and those his snitching on resulted in torture or worse.  And as the book ends, Shin is still on his journey, not sure where he's headed, kind of drifting around South Korea and the U.S. aimlessly and never feeling comfortable.  There was alot of interesting information in the book, but one thing that sticks out is how South Koreans are pretty indifferent to the suffering in North Korea because they feel pushing for re-unification would basically be very expensive for them.  So they more accept the situation in the north and don't push for reforms and more freedom there.

B008JFUPFI|5.0|Henry Cavill is Superman and Superman is going to catapult Henry Cavill into mega stardom. This latest rendition of superman is nothing short of superb. A colossal visual extravaganza of modern day technology, artistry and very strong story telling. The film begins very syfy, I was thinking \\"Star Wars for several moments\\" while watching the set up, but quickly turns into the comic hero, action adventure with lots of heart. The action sequences were bombastic and goosebump inducing. The fans who have been following the many editions and evolution of this superheroe saga will find this film a bit darker, more serious than previous versions.<br /><br />Unlike the final two renditions from the early eighties starring Christopher Reeve, thankfully there are no signs of this superhero ever going the comedic route. You may find that this Superman is pose to break many expectations specially from skeptics. Carrying the film with great elegance, character and charm and as a perfect fit is Henry Cavill. He conveys enough sensitivities to swoon the viewer yet he has all the powers it takes to crash through many buildings as he fights his nemesis General Zod and his bad guys from Krypton.<br /><br />The clever part of this story is that the bad guys are not the usual bad guys we have come expect, because they too have their purpose and noble agenda as well, so its not too difficult to empathize with their plight of survival. Their arrival onto earth is understandable. The stellar cast who accompany Cavill on this latest journey will leave you wanting an additional two to five hours more of \\"Man of Steel\\". But fear not, clocking in at almost two hours and a half you are sure to leave the theatre with your expectations fulfilled and you may very well treat yourself to repeated viewings if only to revisit the magnificence and scale of this spectacle. It is safe to say, this latest superman is so far the event film of 2013. The film you are not soon to forget. It's hair raising emotional content in conjunction with some very real and well done action sequences will keep both men and women coming back for more. The ending does a great job setting the tone for the upcoming sequels. Without question, this latest version of Superman brands Cavill into the hall of fame of superheroes and cements \\"Man of Steel\\" into a new, fresh longstanding franchise. 10/10<br /><br />Entertainment Film News review

0142418471|2.0|as a queer adult, i love reading LGBTQ YA literature because there was NOTHING like this when i was growing up, and it both heartens me and gives me ideas for book recommendations to teach the young people i mentor acceptance and empathy, as well as opening up worlds for the LGBTQ kids i work with.  this book really, really missed the mark.<br /><br />1) the fatphobia in this book is really disappointing- i am always disappointed when books about acceptance and love treat fat characters this way. tiny is the most beloved character in the book, yet the characters who 'love' him use dehumanizing slurs about his weight on every page, including his boyfriend.<br /><br />2) the book touches on serious issues without delving deeper, which is confusing and frustrating- for instance, gary's internalized homophobia (telling more 'flamboyant' or flirty gay characters they aren't 'helping the cause'), or the APPALLING thing that maura did to will grayson 2- i felt this was just treated as a prank (with people urging will to TALK TO HER and apologize to her!!!!) rather than a really abusive, sociopathic action.<br /><br />3) the ending was so abrupt and unrealistic, and if the authors had taken just 2-3 more pages to flesh it out, it could've been beautiful. after enduring being called 'fatty' and 'a whale' by his BOYFRIEND, tiny deserved a more thoughtful ending.<br /><br />i've read several books by john green and by david levithan, and am almost always disappointed by the fact that they *almost* get it, but don't quite get it.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Engrossing and captivating! I started this boxed set after falling in love with the HBO series Game of Thrones. In truth, I was going through withdrawal after each season ended, leaving me wanting more while knowing I would have to wait for the next season to come around.  Now I don't have to wait! The characters are multi-dimensional and as raw & real as they come, the story lines numerous and multi-faceted. This is not your typical fantasy story with a romantic notion of Medieval life and its predictable heroes/heroines & villians.  Here, villians can suddenly grow a heart, which is both confusing and compelling much like people are in real life. AGOT will pull you in and cast a spell, from which you will not want to awaken.  Pure Magic!
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I looked forward to reading K.H. s latest and was very disappointed in the book and struggled to finish it.  The book has to many characters, spans 60 years, and lacks character development. The beginning of the story is intriguing and the bottom falls out midway and it becomes uninteresting. K.H. wrote one of the greatest books ever written when he wrote A Thousand Splendid Sun's but he didn't hit the mark with this one.

I am glad I chose that movie.  It was Very Funny!<br />The issue of aging and parenting and being married and interacting with family all at the same time makes for one funny movie.  I have to say my favorite scene is the discussion on I love you and this is how I'd kill you. That was a hoot!<br />Bad financial decisions, no communication and overreacting are combinations for comedy.  ...and Mellissa McCarthy is my heroine!  I'm sorry I missed this film while it was at the theater, but I'm glad I caught it on Amazon Instant Streaming!
1400168252|5.0|By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.<br /><br />Three o'clock in the morning is an hour for young boys.  Their parents fast asleep in their beds, it is an hour for explorations, and secret things.  Thirteen year olds William Holloway and Jim Nightshade are no exception, but on one particular three a.m. excursion in the month of October, also a magical time for boys, the two adventurers find that some secrets are better left undisturbed.<br /><br />It is on this particular autumn night that the Dark and Cooger Carnival arrives in their small, Midwest town on an ancient looking steam train.  Unable to resist, the two boys follow the carnival train to an empty field just outside the town limits, the wind howling through the exposed calliope like a siren song to their young ears.  It is on this night that the two friends get their first look at the mysterious Mr. Dark, also known as the Illustrated Man because of the tattoos that cover much of his body.  Their curiosity far from sated, they vow to explore the carnival more thoroughly.<br /><br />Over the next few days and nights, the boys learn that this is no ordinary carnival: the hall of mirrors where barely glimpsed figures seem to beckon you ever deeper, the wax museum where the statues look a little too real, and the unusual backward running carousel that literally unwinds a person's years as it spins.  Unfortunately for the boys, their secret, late-night excursions have not gone unnoticed; Mr. Dark knows what they have seen, and he knows their names.<br /><br />It is young William's father, Charles Holloway, who begins to shed some light on the matter, although even that light is dark and poses more questions than answers.  Rummaging through the old archives at the town library, where he is head librarian, Charles uncovers newspaper advertisements for the Dark and Cooger Carnival, newspaper articles from 1910, 1888, 1860, and 1846, same ads, same names, Dark and Cooger, Cooger and Dark, and always in October.  Charles is a middle-aged man who often feels feeble and useless, especially where his young son is concerned, but when Will and Jim are captured by Mr. Dark and imprisoned in the carnival, he will have to face his fears and enter the beast's lair to save them.<br /><br />In my lifetime, I have read a small handful of books that just scream \\"Halloween!\\" to me.  The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is one, and Ray Bradbury's classic Something Wicked This Way Comes is another.  Bradbury captures some of the magic of childhood masterfully in this book: the kind of magic that young boys find late at night, and especially in the month of October.  I don't know what it is about October; maybe it's the way the earth seems to be preparing for along sleep that really makes you feel alive.  Whatever it is, Bradbury knows about it.  It seems like a lot of his stories occur in October.<br /><br />I love the relationship that Bradbury crafted between Charles Holloway and his son Will.  Charles married and had a child much later in life than is usual, and has always struggled with his relationship with his son, often feeling that he has nothing to offer the boy.  Will struggles with it too, seeing other boys with their young, active fathers, and wondering what went wrong in his own situation.  It is the Dark and Cooger Carnival that finally draws them together, giving the two a new respect for each other in the ways that they both handle this new evil that has entered their lives.<br /><br />I can't think of anyone better than Stefan Rudnicki to read Something Wicked This Way Comes.  His dramatic, deep voice lends something of a spectral flair to the spooky tale, and anyway, he's just one of the better narrators in the business.<br /><br />I can't say that I'm a huge fan of Bradbury's work in general, but he really nailed this one.  This is a story about the magic of youth, and the frustration of age.  It is about facing your fears and coming to grips with them, andit is about bridging the generation gap.  Something Wicked This Way Comes is a beautifully written story, and a must-read for your Halloween reading list.it is about bridging the generation gap.

0307938905|3.0|I waited a pretty long time to read The Night Circus.  I really wanted it when it was released last year but other books kept coming up and this one got pushed aside.  So I was pretty excited when I finally got the opportunity to sit down with it recently.<br /><br />The Night Circus started off great, and it's clear right from the beginning that there is something very odd, and something very special, about this particular Circus.  There are tents and tents everywhere, rather than just one big top and instead of reds and golds and other bright colors, they are all striped with black and white.  And of course there's the sign at the main gate, also white on black, that reads, \\"Opens at Nightfall, Closes at Dawn.\\"  You can't help but wonder, along with the crowd gathered at the gate, what kind of circus is only open at night?  In those opening paragraphs Erin Morgenstern draws the reader into the story, talking directly to us as she describes the scene, and she does it very effectively.  Her descriptive phrases and uncanny choice of words are almost a thing of beauty.  Just a few minutes into the story I'm already expecting something special, something along the lines of Something Wicked This Way Comes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it was kind of downhill from there.  Throughout the audiobook, Morgenstern's descriptions continue to tingle the senses but there's just not much happening in this story.  There is a plot, of sorts, revolving around two magicians who compete with one another and another plot involving a boy who falls in love with one of the circus performers, but these plots are pretty thin and don't do much to drive the story.  One of my fellow audiobook reviewers described The Night Circus as \\"all icing and no cake\\" and I think that sums it up pretty well.  Morgenstern's well-sculpted prose kept me interested for a while, but with no substance to back it up even that failed to hold my interest indefinitely.<br /><br />Most of you probably already know Jim Dale, the famous narrator of the Harry Potter series.  In The Night Circus, Dale is his usual brilliant self, bringing life to the characters in a way that very few narrators can.  His narration doesn't seem quite as magical (pun intended) as it did in Harry Potter, but I believe that's only because he didn't have as grand a story to work with.  At any rate, Dale is one of my favorite narrators and I believe that any story he reads is worth a listen.ale, the famous narrator of the Harry Potter series.

Filled with researches from all of the most important scholars around, Kahneman goes right to the point with straightforward visions of what he thinks that matters. A must read for all people who like to know more about human thinking.
1402593872|5.0|Every hotel has its history, and its ghosts.  The Overlook Hotel, a posh mountain resort in the Colorado Rockies, is no exception.  Built in the early 1900's, the Overlook's history is long and colorful.  A child dies of asphyxiation on the playground, a spurned lover leaps from a third floor window, a rich old woman commits suicide in a second floor bathtub, three men are slain in a gangland murder in the presidential suite.  Is it bad luck, or is there some deeper meaning to the Overlook's tragic past?<br /><br />Dick Halloran, the hotel's head chef, knows a little of the Overlook's history.  Dick has what some people would call a \\"psychic twinkle\\", but what he himself calls \\"the shining.\\"  Whatever you want to call it, what Dick has is the ability to see things that others do not.  Sometimes he can see what people are thinking.  Sometimes he can catch glimpses of the future, or the past.  For people like Dick Halloran, the Overlook Hotel seems to come alive.  The mask slips aside slightly, allowing a glimpse of the true face beneath, and the true face of the Overlook is not pleasant at all.<br /><br />Enter Jack Torrance.  Jack was once a young up-and-comer in the literary field.  With several published stories, a post at a prestigious New England prep school, a beautiful wife, and a young son, his destiny seemed sure.  But Jack has a couple of problems: alcoholism and rage.  The two problems combined have proven too much for Jack, costing him his job, not to mention the prospect of finding another one, and nearly costing him his family.  Luckily, Jack has friends in high places.  Al Shockley, who happens to own a controlling interest in the Overlook Hotel, sets Jack up to be the hotel's caretaker during the winter months when the Overlook is closed.  It is the perfect opportunity for Jack, Wendy, and Danny.  A positive mark on Jack's resume, and plenty of solitude for him to finish the play he has been writing.  A cooling-off period if you will.<br /><br />There is just one small problem.  Jack's son, five-year-old Danny, has what Dick Halloran has: the shining.  And when Dick meets the family, he is amazed to find that Danny shines stronger than anyone he has ever met.  Dick tries to warn Danny about the Overlook, but the boy is only five after all.<br /><br />The first couple of months at the Overlook are among the happiest that Jack, Wendy, and Danny have shared as a family, but the longer Danny, with his unusually powerful senses, spends in the hotel, the livelier the hotel becomes.  Danny is the winding key that starts the Overlook Hotel in motion.  Danny with his powerful shine.  The Overlook wants Danny so that it can run forever and ever, but to get Danny, it must first get Jack.  Poor Jack, who is already half-mad, is the perfect tool for the hotel to get what it wants.  And Jack is a willing tool.  The Overlook represents his last, best hope for getting the train-wreck of his life back on the rails.  It is a conundrum that can never be solved.  Jack must save the hotel to save his family, but the Overlook Hotel has plans of its own.<br /><br />Jack Torrance's slow decline into madness is as heartbreaking as it is inevitable.  Even after reading The Shining half a dozen times or so, I still find myself cheering for Jack, urging him to straighten up, to get away from the Overlook before it destroys him, always to no avail.  I can think of no other author that invokes such a strong commitment from his readers, for his characters.  Stephen King's ability to make the reader care about his characters has always been his strong point, and I can think of no other audiobook where he did it as well as he did with Jack Torrance in The Shining.<br /><br />Campbell Scott is kind of a no-frills audiobook narrator.  He does little to differentiate between the voices of the characters, but somehow that's okay.  Maybe I'm more lenient because The Shining is just such a great story.  I had no trouble finishing this audiobook as Ido with some of the more boring narrators.<br /><br />The Shining is for all of us who have suffered addictions or other personal demons, and tried to overcome them.  King's own personal experience is evident throughout the audiobook.do with some of the more boring narrators.<br /><br />The Shining is for all of us who have suffered addictions or other personal demons, and tried to overcome them.

1597801585|4.0|I enjoyed reading this, but the Science is horrible.  If you are into hard Science Fiction, this book will make you cringe.  This is more of a Future Fantasy.  But it's entertaining.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game can definitely keep you busy for house, hut is lacking a few details from making it a five star game. other than prospecting every 24 hours and getting possibly one cash, there is no way to get game cash without buying it. I feel this is a significant flaw in the game. It would jot he such a huge deal if some parts of the game or some quest could.jot be completed wihtot cash. There is even a required quest that uses cash. I agree that cash should be rare, but there still.should he some conversion possibly.to get cash I.e. $10,000 coins to one cash. Beyond that, this is definitely a patientence game. The game appears to be designed not for you to play for hours, but for you to play 20 minutes every couple of hours throughout the day. I would still recommend this game to anyone that likes a challenge.
B00CBKXGPI|1.0|Based on the good reviews I wanted to try this.<br /><br />Well it installed fine but then nothing works.  I get a picture and find an object and nothing happens.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I know folks were upset, we all waited so long for this book, but I on the other hand thought this book was amazing and cant wait for the next two, in fact this book was so good I am glad their relationship is still going on and there is so much more for them to build on. So much more for us to really understand who these two people are and follow how they are falling so deeply for each other. I am so glad it is continuing as I dont want it too end, there is still too much going on in their pasts and in their healings that this book could not get through it all so I thought is was beautifully done in introducing us to them getting closer.<br /><br />I like the new characters to make it interesting and I think we are going to learn so much more that looking back at all three books hit on and now we are going to know all the answers.....soon.<br /><br />The only complaint is DONT make me wait so long for this story, I cant wait I want know what is going to be the final!<br />I love you Sylvia Day and I cant wait for the next two books, I hope they are all just as wonderful!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Waited almost a whole yr for this book to come out and found it some what drawn out and boring. Now on top of this only to find out there will  be another book that we will have to wait for to find out the answers I thought I would find out in this book UGH!!

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I recently upgraded my cell phone and learned the vehicle charger that I used with my old phone did not have adequate output to charge my new phone, my battery would go dead even if I left the charger connected, it just took a little while longer.<br /><br />After reading other reviews I decided on this charger.  What sold me on it is the output, the rugged design and the fact that it doesn't have an annoying LED.  As for now, I have no dislikes.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|So, I Woke up This Morning To An IUpdate.  I Thought, Hey, Maybe This Will Fix The Small Video Glitches... No Luck.  It Has Made It Worse, Hanging Up For 3+ Minutes Trying To Connect To Any Network.  The Game Is Now Totally Unplayable.  Fix It And I'll Upgrade My Review.<br /><br />RAZR M<br /><br />Updated 7/12/13 - So they did fix the video problem, but now I've run into what a lot of other reviewers are talking about.  250 gems for one pony that you have to have to continue the game, and it's not even a main one!  It's just one of the Skybolts.  So I thought, hey I'll support a good game, and Gems just went on sale.... well don't bother.  I have tried twice to purchase gems, and the purchase goes through on the Amazon side, but NOTHING comes through to the app.  So I'll just continue to plow through what I can play and when it gets to the point I can do nothing more then I guess I'll stop playing...
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I can't stop playing, I love it. However, despite being a free game they get money out of you still. Some prices are ridiculous, like $50 out of your own pocket if you want a T-Rex or you can try to save up a lot of cash on the game to get one. But good luck with that since they don't give you much cash  on the game at a time unless you charge that too.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy most (if not all), Solitaire games. This is the first one I learned from my parents. Love the challenge of getting 'er done!
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Some spoilers:  Clark Kent (Henry Carvill) discovers his destiny while recalling how he was brought up by his human parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). While reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) wants to tell the whole world what she learned in the artic and the Kent farm about Clark Kent.<br />  But just as she's deciding to expose his secret of not, enemies from his home planet arrive led by General Zod (Michael Shannon) and demand that Kal-El/Clark go to them or they'll hurt humans. Kal-El has DNA sacred to their race that Zod is pissed about it being given to him by Jor-El (Russel Crowe). So Kal-El must fight for the planet and people he learned to love.<br />  The film is picked on by critics that know nothing due to the dark tone, being too serious and Cavill hardly ever smiling. Richard Roeper even said the film lacks joy when the action we do get is a lot of fun and the very end is kind of cutesy but in a good way.<br />  Cavill shines and shouldn't be compared to Christopher Reeves since he does have plenty of charm when the script by the Nolan's actually allows it. Their Batman Begins like script with all the flashbacks to Clark's childhood didn't work as well for Superman and slowed the film down too much. While Clark actually having to be pushed out of the way by fisherman so a cage wouldn't fall on him didn't work since wouldn't Clark heard it falling ? He does have super hearing.<br />  While we still think of Terrence Stamp when Michael Shannon doesn't get to do much but yell and look angry as Zod. And Amy Adams plays a tough Lois but didn't really become the role the way Erica Durance did in Smallville. Laurence Fishburne is a great actor but so far him being cast as Perry White seems to just be for the hell of it and not because he was perfect for the part.<br />  I am a fan of the Nolan's but they need to realize that Superman films need to be a little whimsical and have some humor. Director Zach Snyder (Watchmen) and the Nolan's did a good job giving us the human side of Superman but they also over did that in a way. I enjoyed the film a lot but it also didn't make me excited about a future of DC films with Christopher Nolan is charge. He needs to lighten up, we don't need a Wonder Woman film with flashbacks of her with a beard in Alaska arm wrestling big muscular dudes, while she also recalls how she found the invisible jet.g us the human side of Superman but they also over did that in a way.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is a disturbing and provocative story. It is full of unlikable characters and secrets yet keeps you reading to learn more. I really enjoyed this book.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Still intrigued. Beautifully written (of course) and easily understood. The points he makes are simple and concise and you don't feel like he is talking down to you.<br />A great read.

B00CL50LEC|3.0|I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie, I thought it would be dumb. I decided to give it a try, after seeing an interview with the two leading actors. I rented it on amazon. I was surprised, it was a good movie! There's some  good music, decent acting, and some funny scenes. Its a different kind-of love story.  I recommend giving it a try and renting it.;)
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|Cute movie but could have been more action. Other than that solid acting and funny/romantic plot line. Good graphics too.
B005JABSB6|4.0|First of all, I gave these glasses 4 stars instead of 5 strictly because of the price. The 3D quality is amazing but I think Sharp can create the same effect with cheaper glasses. We have an 80&#34; Sharp Aquos tv (in the family room) and a Vizio 40-inch (in our bedroom). The Vizio uses regular 3D glasses (the ones you bring home from the movie theater - so no extra cost!) and the 3D is great. The Sharp tv uses these (the others won't work - we tried) and the picture is quite amazing in 3D(though I'm pretty sure it's because of the tv itself - picture and size) but, even at Amazon's less-than-retail price, they're too expensive. Plus, they're too big for children to wear so it is hard to watch a family movie in 3D because the kids can't wear the glasses. I just think Sharp could do better at manufacturing something that is more versatile and cheaper. Everyone else seems to be able to do it.  However, aside from the price, the glasses work very well and are very light to wear. Combine these with an 80&#34; tv and you have your own movie theater!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's decent<br /><br />Good laugh easy to use, can waist hours on it ! Paying for things is rubbish however<br />And needing to do tasks like this is a bore
B00499NHLC|5.0|The writers are exceptional, great plot and dialogue, moving classic stories into the 21st century.<br />The main characters are acted well but some of the minor villains could be more developed.

B00DF0POXA|2.0|I was anxious to hear a new offering from Kanye, but I am very disappointed with this album. Since the \\"college\\" trilogy, Mr. West has experimented with his sound, in an effort to \\"evolve\\" I guess you would say, but this in my opinion is by far his worst album to date. I don't know what direction this album was supposed to take, but it is nothing at all like any previous material. As others have stated, it sounds like he's been influenced by Death Grips and Odd Future, but this isn't Kanye at all. This album sounds like it was thrown together at the last minute with half-effort.<br /><br />I feel like he's steadily falling off as an artist, and was hoping this album would resemble his earlier music, when he was still raw, new, and a breath of fresh air, but this album just leads to the decline Mr. West has been on since the Twisted Fantasy album. I hope this low point will bring back a new focused Kanye in the future...

B00DF0POXA|4.0|First off I really dislike Kanye West as a person beacause he tries to hard to be different and seems like a diva. But I can appreciate good music. He is so far gone from Graduation album Ive come to accept this its my favorite album. He now makes more dark and highly produced to be cinematic sounding songs. People hating on this album are really just Kanye haters or plainly are too commercialized (unsophisticated) to listen to the music and appreciate production and lyrics.<br />On Sight- Is def a house song that should be danced to in club. Love the sample at 1:17 to take a break from song<br />New Slaves- Is a heavy song with a serious subject matter but still a catchy entertaining song.<br />Hold my Liquor- is VERY Cruel Summer sounding Chief Keek on the hook its a nice slow song nothing to go crazy over.<br />Send it up- Is another song like On Sight very dance heavy.<br />Black Skinhead- Is another song like New Slaves has a nice beat and lyrics dark song but still catchy and entertaining.<br />BLOO ON THE LEAVES- 5 STARS BEST SONG ON ALBUM even though Cassidy sampled this WAY before Kanye. Great song great hook great beat great Sample.<br />Bound 2- Is somewhat close to Late Registration type song with a good hook sample.<br />Im in it- Is a pretty forgettable song somewhat filler its still not bad just nothing special.<br />Guilt Trip- Slower song more mellow song.<br />I am God- Another good song very dance house sounding song.<br /><br />All in all a great album don't come in expecting usual rap BUT I DONT KNOW WHY YOU WOULD KANYE HASNT HAD A NORMAL RAP ALBUM SINCE GRADUATION. Very heavy dance techno sounding like some songs Kanye imagined being played in a club or on runway in Paris.

She takes a simple joke and then keeps going with it, rendering it even funnier. It goes from simple funny, to corny-on the verge of not funny anymore, to even funnier because it's so far gone by this point. I am in the Army and I love Ellen Degeneres!

B0036G8IQS|5.0|I've read this before and really enjoyed it, and while looking for something to read saw it again- a great re-read! Riordan does a wonderful job building characters and incorporating some light hearted humor throughout his tales. His books are fresh, easy reads and leave you wanting more! I was glad to see Percy come back in the new series and am excited to see tie-ins with the Kane chronicles as well. If you haven't read any of Riordan's stories and you are looking for a good, clean, light hearted tale start here!

0920236162|4.0|This book was higly recommended, but I found it to be written for a very young child..maybe 2-3 years old. It was short with only several lines per page. The story was good, and engaging. The illustrations were good. I guess because it was rated so highly, I was expecting more.

B005LAIH2W|4.0|Those who have read Edgar Rice Burrough's books will probably hate this movie since it stray far from their storyline: the characters are there (for the most part) but some have been altered significantly.<br /><br />If taken as a sci-fi film on its own, this movie was quite enjoyable: plenty of action, fascinating special effects, delightful characters.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is entertainment and distraction at its best. I find no particular merit other than using the time that it fills.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Finally we learn the outcome of years of antagonism between Harry Potter & his mortal enemy Valdemort. Plenty of magic action & greater involvement of secondary characters. Very enjoyable. Surprise conclusion.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is good for developing special concepts.  It becomes quite challenging at the higher levels.  Hard to put down.
0393338398|5.0|Moneyball is an amazing look into the world of major league baseball, baseball executives, baseball statistics, and decision making.  Michael Lewis has crafted a wonderful account of Billy Beane and his use of sabermetrics to fashion a baseball team with fewer monetary resources than 99% of major league teams.  The indepth analysis of sabermetrics such as on-base percentage (OBP), slugging percentage, and on-base % + slugging % (not two equivalent statistical measures but used anyway...have to read the book) and the background information on Bill James - the &#34;king&#34; of sabermetrics - give great insight into the mind set and decision making of Beane, Paul DePodesta, and others in the Oakland A's camp.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Guillermo Del Toro is truly a genius and he is the sole reason why I was so looking forward to this film. The film is actually great. There is a lot of suspense and drama. Del Toro delivers a great film as producer. However, the ending could have been a lot better. it does not ruin the movie, but I wish they had gone in a different direction. All in all, it's still definitely worth a buy.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like it, maybe make it so people can design their own player and surfboards, other than that the game is really good. VERY ADDICTIVE!
B0053O89XI|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is the funniest show I've seen in a long time. I already had seasons 1-4 and knew season 5 would be great. And I was right. If you enjoy The Big Bang Theory, you will surely enjoy season 5!!
B000SEHJGQ|1.0|too vulgar  no plot  good for juveniles  kept hoping it would get better.  it did not.  i gave up on it
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Truly Tarantino's best film to date. Django Unchained is an amazing film. Historically accurate? Not really. But who cares. The action, drama, suspense, comedy, and even the romance are flawlessly executed in classic Tarantino style. Christoph Waltz delivers yet another amazing performance. Jaimee Foxx was perfect for the role of Django. And Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic and despicable as the plantation owner who owns Django's slave wife.<br /><br />Worth every penny. You won't regret buying Django Unchained!

B000PMLFRA|4.0|As I read the reviews, I was convinced to purchase the copy with the blue cover with Vader's helmet taking up about 95% of the cover. Unfortunately, this wasn't the one I had intended. This one has some of the extra scenes and graphics like Jabba talking with Han at the Millennium Falcon. I didn't care for the extra scenes and the fact that there are no Extras or Special Features definitely was a letdown.<br /><br />Still, the original Star Wars trilogy is fantastic. Just not sure if I can even get the original trilogy on Blu-ray without Lucas mucking it up.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game! Can't wait for more! Well worth the money. Try not using the clues for an extra challenge. Couldn't put it down!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I just ordered one of these.  Rather than using the CD in the box, since my MBPr has no way to read it, I downloaded the latest driver from http://prolificusa.com/pl-2303hx-drivers/ which supports 10.6/7/8.  My MBPr is currently running OS X 10.8.4 (June 2013).  It was easy enough to install the driver but does require you temporarily disable the security setting of don't allow apps from unknown sources.  Install, reboot, plug in and good to go.<br /><br />I've tried it at 9600 to 56k speeds with mostly Cisco and Brocade network equipment and it worked fine for all of them.  It also shows up under the network devices list so if you actually did have a serial modem it should work fine there as well; fortunately my last modem went away a long time ago.

B00CTSDDVO|3.0|OK I know this has a more plotholes than Swiss cheese but it is still worth watching. If you are a diehard member of 'JJ has spoilt Star Trek' crowd don't watch this movie you will have a fit. If you enjoyed the Star Trek 2009 you will enjoy this one, even tho the 2009 film is better. Sadly they did go down the TWOK route. Some fans love it, some do not. I am the latter, but it did provide me with good laughs at its absurdity. Maybe the next plot will be 100% original, since its an alternative reality/universe as they said and not an alternative timeline or do they plan to name it 'Star Trek: The Wrath of the Humpback Wales'?
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|the characters are engaging.  The story concept is interesting. Though nearly three hours, I was not ready for it to end.

B00B5HQKNI|1.0|This film was a disappointment and it really shows as a product of its time. The problem for Cdr Bond and his colleagues is that there is no natural enemy, the Soviet Union is long gone. The film opens in Turkey with a rather inexplicable series of action scenes after someone dies in a flat. There is no obvious reason to put so many innocent bystanders at risk, and the film makes it hard to sympathise with Bond and his fellow bureaucrats, who seem to regard themselves as above the law, as you might if Bond were real.<br /><br />The rather mysterious villain turns out to be a psycho-babbling Spanish-accented villain with a Portuguese name with a childish grudge. He has no clear means of support, and operates remarkably freely given his past, but his actions seem pitiful rather than threatening. The film also has a bizarre theme of MI6 struggling to argue for its budget with daft scenes involving a committee of politicians. Bond's main task seems to be to protect his employer's budget from 'cuts', which is a rather precious approach, even if it might be true to life.<br /><br />The film has Bond retreating to his ancestral home in Scotland, not to find a lost Scottish accent. Bizarrely, he has virtually no back-up to help him, and his ancestral home has, for unexplained reasons, a Priest Hole, which is a purely English phenomenon, not a Scottish one.<br /><br />There is a nod in the film to the unsavoury people trading in Macau, but at one point you might wonder if the femme fatale is going to turn out to be a Ladyboy.<br /><br />Overall, the plot is weak, the action scenes formulaic, the whole film feels as if it was written by a committee appointed by the BBC.
030758836X|1.0|Two things are important to me in the books I read.  Characters that I can have some feelings for or about.  A story that I can believe or at least about which I can suspend my belief.  This book had neither.  The two main characters were so repulsive that I kept wishing one would at least do away with the other so that I would only feel half as bad.  The story was woven together with infinite care, but none of it rang true.  The story kept trying to convince me that Amy could create these foolproof circumstances to baffle everyone around her.  It only convinced me that she had to be surrounded by total fools to stumble around in such nonsense.  I'm a reader who is very easy to please.  I also finish every book I start.  Gone Girl almost made me forsake that last habit.

0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is master-storyteller Neil Gaiman's new book for adults. It's short (less than 200 pages) and straightforward: a man just past middle aged returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. He wanders his old streets and awakens memories long forgotten.<br /><br />I'm not going to talk about the plot here, because it's amazing and fun and I don't want to give anything away. Just go read it.<br /><br />As our narrator relives some of the darkest moments of his childhood, the story becomes a meditation on the nature of growing up. Anyone who has kids (or who can remember the magical bits of your own childhood) will recognize the boy who finds The Ocean at the End of the Lane.<br /><br />His world is dangerous: inhabited by monsters and wonders and oblivious, unhelpful adults. If you'll permit me a short tangent, this is the quality of Neil's writing I love most (probably. They're hard to rank). In Neil's books, kids are in real danger.<br /><br />To a kid, the world is a scary place, and too often we adults don't take their beliefs and fears seriously enough.<br /><br />Neil takes us back into that world, where everything is magical and that's not necessarily a good thing. A child's world brims with possibility and - because of the perceived danger - real stakes. Ocean at the End of the Lane somehow manages to paint a picture of this fantastic children's world without condescending to us.<br /><br />Neil's story invites us into the person of the narrator in more ways than one. We feel like visitors to this world. It's clearly well-crafted, wholly thought-out and beautiful. But the setting never supersedes the story. We're left with a lot of questions, an ache to return to the Ocean at the End of the Lane. We hunger for more of this world that keeps slipping through our fingers, not because the world is unformed, but because it's not our world. We don't live there; we're only visiting for a little while.<br /><br />The story summons up all the wonder and isolation of childhood while at the same time touching on home and friendship and sibling rivalry and sacrifice and so much more. But these never overtake the pure wonder of the story itself.<br /><br />Ocean at the End of the Lane is a love song and lament for the innocence of childhood.<br /><br />Too often we lose the sense of wonder and awe that permeates the life of a child. To read a story like this both thrills and haunts us, as we recognize the children we were, the world we lived in, and acknowledge that we've lost it.<br /><br />As he always does, Neil gives us a story that reminds us there's always more to the world than meets the eye. We need more stories like this to call us back to the magical, wonder-filled world we left behind when we grew up.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Ocean at the End of the Lane recaptures the wonder of childhood without patronizing us. It's short, sweet and magical.<br /><br />YOUR TURN: Are you a fan of Neil Gaiman? What did you think of Ocean at the End of the Lane?<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free for review purposes from the publisher. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: \\"Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.\\"<br /><br />- See more at: [...]ame time touching on home and friendship and sibling rivalry and sacrifice and so much more.

B000EQ5HSK|5.0|For some Canon L lens, such as the 17-40mm and 24-105mm the OEM lens hood is optimized for full frame DSLRs, but do not work well for the crop frame DSLRs.  This hood provides the needed shading for the crop DSLRs.  Well built with a high quality finish and felt type material on the inside to absorb stray light.

0800177975|4.0|Ok welcome to this, this is a review for a movie that either came out 10 years ago or 20 years ago & this review is for Last Action Hero a movie that doesn't get a whole lot of respect cause back when this movie came out nobody got it & it was competeing against Jurassic Park & Cliffhanger. I believe had this movie came out about 5 years later during the time period when movies with in movies like Scream & movies that were self referancing itself like Austin Powers I believe this movie would've done better or been a hit. Plus Arnold would've had to avoid Batman & Robin cause that movie did hurt his drawing ability for a long time. The Nostalgia Critic called this a boring action movie. This isn't a staight up action movie it's a movie with in a movie honestly there are few of The Nostalgia Critics reviews I agree with most of the time he bashes innovative movies or harmless family movies. I mean would this movie get the hate it does if it was released in the late 90's. If you remember my review last year I did for Cool World I know those are 2 different types of movies but both were trying to be innovative & have a fun factor to it but 1 was done right the other was done wrong. This movie was made on a budget of $85 million made only $15 million it's opening weekend so it did bomb at the box office. Made $50 million in it's entire run in The US it made $87 million worldwide but it was still a failure. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he felt that it should've been released later in the year. Directed by John McTiernan he directed Die Hard & Die Hard With A Vengence & the 1st Predator movie. Stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater he also makes an appearance as himself. Austin O Brien as Danny Madigan, Charles Dance as Denedict, Tom Noonan as The Ripper he also makes an appearance as himself. Bridgette Wilson as Whitney Slater & Anthony Quinn as Tom Vinaldi. This is about this kid named Danny Madigan who is a huge fan of action movies & this series of action movies known as The Jack Slater at the beginning he is watching Jack Slater III & in this movie Jack Slater's son is killed by The Ax Ripper. At school Danny is learning about Shakespere but Danny finds it boring which leads to this awesome scene where he day dreams about how Jack Slater would handle it. Danny's Mom isn't happy that he is skipping school to go to the theater & watch movies. There is this guy that breaks into their apartment & there is nothing valuable there so he leaves some kind of key & leaves. This burglers only reason is to leave a key for Danny. Danny tells The Police & goes off to see Jack Slater IV. The old man who runs The Projector gives him a magic ticket & he ends up in Jack Slater IV where Jack Slater is in a car chase with some bad guys. You also have nods to other movies like Sharon Stone is coming out of The Police Department & Robert Patrick as The T 1,000. Slater is always yelled at by Lietenant Dekker who is the cliche by the book Cop. Danny tries to convince Jack Slater that he's in a movie when there is a cartoon Cat that is a Detective working there. Slater had a cousin that was killed early on in the movie. Danny tells Slater that these 2 guys Benedict & Tony are behind it he goes to Benedict's Mansion Benedict is suspicous of them when he hears what Danny is talking about so he sends some of his men to follow them. Danny wants to show Jack that this is a movie so they go to a movie store where everything is messed up T2 stars Slyvester Stallone. Slater goes to see his Daughter Whitney & leaves her to take care of Danny while he looks for Benedict. Benedict & his group break into Slater's house & Benedict gets a hold of the magic ticket you also have Whitney hold her own against Benedict's thugs Jack Slater returns to the house kicks some a  s  s Bededict escapes Slater chases after him Danny doesn't want to miss all the action so he steals a girls bike he's almost ran over cause he thought he was the good guy & he is & he flys up & passes thge moon which this movie parodies ET. 1 of these dumb Cips find a glass eye & accidently activates an explosive device & Jack Slater's house is destroyed. Lieutenant Dekker fires Jack Slater & he's about to give up until Danny helps him discover that something is going to happen at this funeral cause Benedict & Vinaldi have nerve gas put into this body. Slater goes there meets up with a friend from The Department & he  betrays him but Danny pulls a gun out on this guy but Danny has a gun pointed at him by Benedict & Vivaldi's men. The Cat Detective saves them. Then you have a real funny scene where Slater goes to get the body & he yells that he is a doctor & this man is still alive then you have all these people at the funeral pull guns on Slater & you alos have Danny controlling a crane & he knocks those people out of the way. You have a lot of great stunt work with Arnold on the crane. 1 thing leads to another Slater & the body land in a tar pit & they prevent the nerve gas from spreading. Whitney shows up with a change of clothes. Danny is like isn't this convent. Benedict has found out that the magic ticket has the power to take him to our world. Benedict kills Vivialdi. Then Jack Slater shows up when he throws Benedict into his body guard played by Professor Tou Tanaka they go through the wall they follow after them. Where Tou Tanaka  is killed in a car crash. Danny goes home & introduces his Mom to Jack Slater. Meanwhile you have Benedict on the streets of New York City he shoots some random guy for attention. He decides to pull people from the other Jack Slater movies he gets The Ripper from Jack Slater III to go after Arnold Schwarzenegger at The Premier of Jack Slater IV. Later that night Danny spots Benedict Slater chases after him unfortantly Benedict used the ticket to flee to the premier. This scene is hilarous where all the celebraties are there like Little Richard, Tom Noonan, Jean Claude Van Damme & Arnold Schwarzenegger himself are there. Slatergoes into the theater after Benedict Danny spots The Ax Ripper he goes to warn Slater. Danny is grabbed by The  Ripper Slater goes for the shot but he is stopped by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold follows Jack around he tellls him that he is the best looking celebaraty look alike he's ever seen he even tries to make a business deal with Slater. Slater tells Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't like you. You ruined my life. He gets to the roof & this plays out just like Jack Slater III cause Slater's son is killed in that movie. The Ripper throws Danny over the roof Slater takes The Ripper's Ax cuts a power line down & electocutes The Ripper & saves Danny & rights the wrong from Jack Slater III. You have Benedict show up & he starts shooting at Jack Slater & Danny. Slater thinks that Benedict has ran out of bullets but he tricked Slater & shoots Slater in the chest. Danny jumps on Slater's back tosses Slater his gun then Slater shoots Benedict in the eye which contains an explosive Benedict's head is blown off & Slater says no sequel for you. Slater is being taken to the hospital Danny wants to take him back to the movie but the paramedics don't know what he is talking about. Danny pulls a gun on them they get out of there somehow Danny knows how to drive too he takes him to Nick's Theater. Ian McKellen shows up from The Seventh Seal. He tells Danny to find the other half of the ticket. He is told by Death that he isn't here for him cause he will die an old Grandpa. The ticket opens the portal where he is taken back to his movie & his gunshot wound is gone Lieutenant Dekker is yelling at him but Slater tels him what's really going on as Slater drives off into the sunset. Wrapping my review up Last Action Hero is a lot of fun & funny as well. The self referancing is great. Characters that I like. A script that has a brain behind it it is smarter that it's given credit for. Really good directing by John McTiernan. Arnold Schwarzenegger was good. Charles Dance does a good job.Anthony Quinn is pretty good. Bridgette Wilson was fine in more than 1 way. It's been 20 years so if you saw this back in the day & hated it give it another shot watch it with an open mind.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Considering the very large number of pop boy bands from the 90's that burst onto the scene, pushed out a few hits, and vanished it's really something that Hanson, a band that many have known and still do know primarily for MMMBop is still going strong! They remain true to their musical roots with Anthem and also pay homage to the bands and music that they love. That's what is nice about this - their obvious hints at influences such as U2, Queen, and Michael Jackson. As is the case with their last few albums, Hanson has branched out again and hired a horn section, viola and violin players, and even an accordionist! Anthem is one of my favorite albums Hanson has ever put out, and I'm thrilled that they made it so awesome. This album has a bolder rock n' roll sound than say This Time Around or Underneath. These boys deserve all the glory that comes their way. Long have they toiled, perilously did they fight, just to bring their fans the highest quality music they knew how.
1591845556|5.0|Josh takes on the multi-billion dollar per year self-help industry by giving you the tools to actually help yourself! Our minds work more effectively with positive reinforcement. Our spirits are bolstered by successful re-creating effort. Learning something new, especially something that's caused you trouble before, makes you a better person and you know it.<br /><br />Josh opens the scene with challenges many of us face. Time is a precious commodity that flits away when we are not paying attention. Josh shares the crucial points on how to improve life by improving self. None of it is esoteric! You don't need a neuro-chemistry lexicon or a bunch of alembics to learn a new skill. Unless, of course, your new skill is chemistry! What you do need is a drive to make your life, and the lives of those close to you, better.<br /><br />Often, we see the basics but get bogged down in figuring out how those principles apply to our particular situation or task. That's why Josh spends most of the book giving practical demonstrations of how the basic tools apply to a very wide range of topics. There's a semi-experiential bonus in watching the applications of fundamentals to diverse issues.<br /><br />Almost twenty years ago I took a C programming class in college. I passed the class but have forgotten most of it. Even worse, I never really did get pointers. Actually, a lot of programmers don't get C pointers; it is a common problem. Since my goal is to become an OS Systems Programmer I really need to understand pointers. Passing a class does not define understanding! Being able to use a skill easily, without having to refer to a book or a web page, is more a mark of an acquired skills.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this if you want to make your life better.
B002Q63JEU|4.0|I've been a paramore fan for a long time, and ignored the drama surrounding the whole band problems, thinking it was the media trying to pick apart this band. With the first Listen of brand new eyes, I noticed a little tension coming from the band. The lyrics seemed really angry, bitter, unapologetic, blunt, but most of all they showed real raw emotion. Riot! Was a poppy punk rock album, and this was like its mad dark brother. Ofcourse it struck a cord with me because we saw paramore in a different light, and the album produced one of my all time favorite songs, All I Wanted.<br />Overall paramore created an album from a therapeutic session, that ultimately split the band,but it was needed to create the amazingly awesome self titled album \\"Paramore\\" in 2013.

1781162646|5.0|This is a great Stephen King story, especially for folks that find much of his stuff overwritten and a bit too ghoulish. Nice linear story line, quick read, interesting characters. A bit of schmaltz but that can be a good thing - nice to have a writer who can bring tears to your eyes. Appealed to me since I enjoy coming of age stories and the innocence of times past.<br /><br />I find it ironic that he was one of the early and avid promoters of e-books and yet he will not release this one in that format since it is supposed to be \\"retro\\" in content and format. Evidently that led to a lot of 1 star ratings which is a shame since it has nothing to do with the quality of the story or the writing.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book was actually a very good book. I think people who read this book will like it very much.

1594484805|2.0|The book has a frustrating pattern, making a logical case for changes in the workplace to give workers greater autonomy and motivation, while failing to provide any evidence that the proposed changes actually work. Doesn't the author realize the technology business world is fairly small, and that employees talk to each other?<br /><br />For example, one company is praised for not caring when people are in the office, but people I know who actually work there say all that means is they're forced to be on call 24/7.<br /><br />Another company is praised for not counting vacation days, but again, a person I know who works there says that just means people are afraid to take vacations, and even if they do, with no formal procedure for being \\"on vacation\\", they're forced to handle calls and emails while on vacation, so they can never get away from work.<br /><br />If the author wants to present a new way of managing employees, then he should have actually measured the effects of the changes he's proposing instead of trotting out unverifiable anecdotes. As you can see, I can easily come up with anecdotes that contradict every point he makes.<br /><br />For example, if he wants to propose that companies not track vacation days, then he should actually do research and find out if employees of companies with such a policy take more or less vacation days than companies with defined vacation policies.<br /><br />In general, the push to give everyone more autonomy is a great idea, as long as every person is highly motivated. Unfortunately, as a parent and manager, I can assure you that motivation varies widely from person to person. For every motivated person who does best when given free reign, there are several who, when left to their own devices, will do the bare minimum to get by. The later type of person can, however, be productive when given structure and guidance.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Unfortunately, Breaking Benjamin is breaking apart as they are now down to only the lead singer, Benjamin Burnley. Both guitarists were fired over legal issues and the drummer left for personal reasons. Fortunately, they were able to still put this record together and amaze everyone. While maybe not their best overall record, it's definitely in the top two no matter what. While some may say that many songs sound the same, there is still enough variety to make this album very memorable.<br /><br />1. Fade Away- this is a very strong opening track that sounds a lot like the rest of the songs, but Burnley's cooing and desperate voice reels you in as soon as it starts. The chorus is one of the best on the album and it has a pretty cool solo mixed in the middle. While this song seems like the \\"Breaking Benjamin formula\\" at work, that is not a bad thing considering the end result is a very good song. Grade: 9/10<br /><br />2. I Will Not Bow- this song is supposed to be the best song on the album, and I have to agree. It's everything that a top song should be with nice verses and a really good, sing-along chorus that all mixes in with a good message through the lyrics. It also features an aspect that they tend to use that I really like; the first chorus is not the complete thing, but the second chorus has an extra part that seems like the song is progressing. Just an all-around stand-out track. Grade: 10/10<br /><br />3. Crawl- I really love this song too. The verses are really dark and depressing, but if you listen closely, so is the rest of the album, so it's fine. I think the verses are actually the best part, with an awesome hook. I also really enjoy the chorus, which includes the first use of Burnley's characteristic growls. Grade: 9.5/10<br /><br />4. Give Me a Sign- the album begins to slow down with this song, which acts a lot like a ballad. Actually, pretty much every song on this album is about love or a relationship, so that isn't really surprising. But it actually delivers on a high level with another great chorus. It's a sad one, but it's still good. Grade: 8/10<br /><br />5. Hopeless- the album picks back up here with a song filled with angst. The chorus features a back and forth of growling and singing, making it possibly the most fast-paced song on the whole album. I actually like this combo of voices that he uses...it's too bad he doesn't use it more often. It's one of the few songs where he doesn't just sing the whole thing. Maybe a little more variety would have drawn in more listeners. Grade: 8/10<br /><br />6. What Lies Beneath- the beginning of this song is what really makes me like this song. The verse then adds to it and the somewhat slower chorus. The second verse is even better than the first and makes this yet another strong song. Musically it doesn't stand out much from the rest and often sounds like others, but it's still a good song. Grade: 8/10<br /><br />7. Anthem of the Angels- this song is just way too slow for me. When he gets into his really slow voice like he does in the verses, I just lose interest. It's still a cute song and has its moments, including the use of the shorter first chorus and longer second one, but I just never seemed to like this one much. It's the weakest track on the album in my opinion, although I'm sure many people would like this one the most. Grade: 6.5/10<br /><br />8. Lights Out- this always reminds me of a filler track, no matter what I think. Even though it's still a pretty good song, it's not as good as the rest. If there was a need to label one filler track on the album, this would be the one. The chorus is not my favorite although it still is alright. It has a good solo which is an added bonus, I just wish it was longer. Grade: 7.5/10<br /><br />9. Dear Agony- sometimes I wonder if this is actually my favorite song on the album. I remember the first time I heard it, I didn't care for it much. But after listening to it more, it really grew on me and I realized that this song was a masterpiece. The hook in the chorus is phenomenal, and the way the song builds up emotion to the point where Burnley seems like he's actually begging the lyrics instead of singing them. It's all just wonderful. Bravo to them for making a song like this. Grade: 10/10<br /><br />10. Into the Nothing- I used to like this one a ton, thinking it was one of the best songs they'd ever written. It still is a really strong song, but it has lost a little of its greatness after a bunch of listens. At least it's a little faster and sounds more upbeat (even though the lyrics are nowhere close to that). I think the chorus is my favorite part of the song even though it's pretty simple. This song probably should've been featured higher up on the album. Grade: 8.5/10<br /><br />11. Without You- here comes probably the saddest song on the whole album. It's a good song to be the clincher, and sometimes it makes me feel legitimately bad for whoever he's talking about in the song. The chorus is one of the strongest on the album, and the way the song ends just sounds like the way an album should. \\"I am with you, forever, the end\\" is a really cool line and sometimes gives me chills with the way he says it. The instrumental ending is different, but it's fine since it's the last song. Grade: 8.5/10<br /><br />While this album sounds pretty similar when you look at each individual song, it still has a lot of positives. He may use some of the same rhymes a lot and talk about eyes in every other song, but it still has two of the best songs they've ever made. I highly recommend this considering it will be their last album that sounds like this, and maybe their last album ever... Overall grade: 8.5/10
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A good story with a high level of detail. The story is suspenseful and fun. The characters are well developed.
B0011ZYLOE|5.0|When I think of dark, heavy albums, this is the first one that comes to mind. It's definitely the heaviest album that I've ever heard from a metal band, which includes being heavier than all of those extreme and death metal albums. Iowa's calculated, pummeling attack makes it Slipknot's best and most complete album, and one that will never be recreated by the entire metal scene.<br /><br />The album starts out with a strange, but haunting instrumental track in which the word \\"death\\" is repeated over and over. If that doesn't set the stage for a heavy, twisted album, I don't know what would. It then perfectly transitions (one of the best intro-to-first track transitions I've heard) into \\"People=S***,\\" one of my favorite overall songs by the band. And, keeping with the overall theme of the album, it's probably their heaviest song ever created. Not only does it pack seemingly infinite emotion, but it has actual meaning by calling out all of mankind and how awful some humans can be.<br /><br />The third track, \\"Disasterpiece,\\" is another standout cut that continues the demolition. The opening lines are purely sickening and cannot be repeated in this review. The album shows no signs of slowing down until the next track, \\"My Plague,\\" which manages to utilize a sung chorus without screams. Including this one, the album then follows a cycle of three heavy songs and one slower song until the final song, the title track. It's a fifteen minute epic that has very slow parts, but all culminates in a couple of quick outbursts by lead singer Corey Taylor that make the song truly emotional.<br /><br />Overall, this is my favorite record from Slipknot because of its completeness and raw emotion, and continues to keep the moniker of the heaviest album on my iPod.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game keeps you engaged the graphics are great and the fact that it's a free app makes it even more fun
B001202LRM|5.0|When Slipknot came onto the scene in 1996 with Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat. they were met with a lot of rejection. That is, until they found a few people that liked them enough to give them a chance. After releasing this album, I was glad that those few people gave them a chance to prove their greatness, because they certainly did so here.<br /><br />This self-titled album starts out the same way as do all of their albums with an instrumental track, except this one has two people constantly repeat \\"The whole thing I think is sick.\\" until the first real song, \\"(sic),\\" kicks in with a killer intro of itself. The drums of Joey Jordison are excellent throughout this album and prove why he's one of my favorite drummers.<br /><br />This album contains a little bit of everything, from an insane chorus of \\"Eyeless\\" to a perfect sing-along song in \\"Wait and Bleed\\" a sick and disgusting story in \\"Prosthetics.\\" All of them combine to create both a strange and heavy first album from clearly one of the weirdest bands of all time. One cannot forget though two of the most famous concert songs in \\"Spit It Out\\" and \\"Surfacing,\\" both of which are sure to find their way onto the set list somehow. The latter is known as the \\"People's Anthem,\\" which seems like the perfect song for an angst-filled teenager ready to rebel. The final song on the regular version of the album is \\"Scissors,\\" which is about a man who cuts himself to death with scissors and has more emotion packed into its eight minutes than any song I've heard.<br /><br />This album has almost nothing wrong with it, but it's not a perfect 10/10. If I could give half ratings, I would, but for now I'll give it a 9.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I love this album and this band so much. They put their heart and soul into everything that they do. This album has great guitar riffs,drums and piano. I especially love for your love. An Isaac ballad with so much heart. Juliet is a great song as well. Love Zac' s vocals on this song. Lost without you by Taylor is so heartwarming. All of the songs are great. A must have for a hanson fan and for anyone who loves wonderful music.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|When you first see that Bruce Willis has the starring role, you know that this movie will be action packed.  The movie has a story line that can be followed easily.  There is moderate violence so you may not want young kids to be in the room when you are watching.  It is worth watching.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game. FIghting is pretty cool. The only problem is its hard to get aircraft without using real money. Still.a.great.game though.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|The story follows OZ instead of Dorothy.  This movie will keep your attention because you are not sure how the story will unfold.  You are following Oz's journey through the city and as he meets new people along his path.  The movie is a nice fairy tale with humor, drama, and choices that Oz has to make about what his true character really is.
B001C1066E|3.0|Bought this for my daughter who loves to cosplay.  This coin purse is flimsy and already has a hole in it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's an awesome game. You should get it. It's fun to play because you can swing on a rope and you get cased by a huge monster.
B008RXYOKY|3.0|This product works as described, I have a Western Digital hard drive connected to my iMac without any problem. A little overpriced for just a adapter thats why im nos giving 5 stars.
B00BWRKVVS|3.0|The movies are cute and entertaining and have great dance songs and Eartha Kitt is legendary.<br />However, my review is just for the Blu-ray release. There is nothing other than the 2 movies in this release. I think the newest Blu-ray releases should AT MINIMUM have all of the features before released on DVD. This has NOTHING. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Nada. It only has a menu to choose between the two movies. Really Disney? The other two movies released at this time do (Atlantis 1&2 and Lilo and Stitch 1&2). So what happened? So if you already own these on DVD, maybe you won't want to upgrade to Blu-ray.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Nice mini game. Fun looks. Fun music. It reminds me of the quell games. Just the right amount of strategy. High quality game.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I did not really enjoy this story as much as I thought that I would. Talk about a dysfunctional group of people!

B0085RQLXK|1.0|Not the Aerosmith I grew up with.  I really tried to like it.  Didn't like a single song on this CD
B00BSWMITK|4.0|I like the band a lot on this album. They have a good sound and sound live, like the Satriani self-titled album. A few out right classics, and one song that feels so out of place, I skip it almost every time (TWOTW). If you are a fan, you will like the album, and want to hear several live. if you are new to Satriani, this will be a nice introduction.<br /><br />Songs to love:<br />Unstoppable Momentum<br />Lies and Truths<br />Jumpin' In
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Terminator 2 had to be one of the coolest movies I saw as a kid in regards to special effects.  I loved it then, and even as an adult, I still enjoy it.  Now, it's on blu-ray, and I'm no audio/video nut, but I have to admit, this looks beautiful.  I can't believe how well the special effects held up on this movie.  Everyone should own this on blu-ray (and considering how cheap this movie usually is on Amazon, there really isn't much of a reason not to buy it, unless you don't like Arnold's acting...then I would say stay away from this cause it's bad...REAL BAD)
B004NELBPC|5.0|Perfect for up to date info and is my top source for my articles. With many categories to choose from, i'm always satisfied.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|Call the genre whatever you want (art-rock, post-rock, experimental, ambient, downright tasty), Iceland's Sigur R&oacute;s is one of the best bands of the current generation.  Big claim, I know, but Kveikur only solidifies the band's stature as one of the genre's best.  If you like Sigur R&oacute;s, go ahead and pick this record up.<br /><br />In past years, Sigur Ros has been criticized for having a \\"formula\\".  If you're a fan of the band, you probably have some idea of what this formula is: soft, atmospheric music, swelling chord changes, and a gigantic build up that leaves the song on a massive crescendo.  Perhaps the band has been aware of their critics.  Since 2008's Með Suð &iacute; Eyrum Við Spilum Endalaust, the band has retreated from their past \\"slow-burn to explosive finale\\" tendencies.  Their 2008 record found the band attempting to write more conventional pop songs (well, what would be pop for Sigur Ros, I suppose), and 2012's Valtari was an exercise in decrescendos.  Valtari (a record I love), was created around music starting somewhat big and working its way down - the album even ends on a 3-song streak in which each proceeding song is a bit softer and a bit more minimalist than the last.  For this reason, coupled with the loss of multi-instrumentalist Kjartan Sveinsson, I was prepared for a minimalist exercise with Kveikur.<br /><br />Earlier in the year, the band released \\"Brennisteinn\\" as their single to promote Kveikur.  This feels a bit misleading (not dishonest though) - the single doesn't really represent what the album sounds like, but rather, it indicates that Sigur Ros is still tooling around with their sound.  To put another way, the rest of Kveikur doesn't sound like \\"Brennisteinn\\" - instead, it seems to be an assurance that we aren't getting another Valtari, or another ( ), or another Von.  Because this song leads the album, it starts Kveikur off with a near-industrial crunch.  At almost 8-minutes, it's one of the most unexpected turns for the band.<br /><br />Similarly, second-released single \\"&Iacute;sjaki\\" isn't as representative either.  &Iacute;sjaki is busy in ways that most of Kveikur isn't, and Jonsi's vocals constantly keep the melody moving along.  But these two singles together tell the story of Kveikuer perfectly - many of the moments on Kveikur are characterized by poppy melodies thrown against a jagged backdrop.  The title track for example has Jonsi singing incredibly catchy vocals over distorted electronics.  These moments give the album's cover (a boy holding an old gas mask over his face) some context.  Other tracks like \\"Yfirborð\\" and \\"Stormur\\" try to strike a similar balance, with Jonsi staying squarely in the spotlight this time around, rather than letting the music play on without him like we've seen in past releases.<br /><br />The band continues toying with its sound, so there is plenty of new things to hear here though.  Musically, this record feels like a mix between Með Suð &iacute; Eyrum Við Spilum Endalaust and Valtari - these songs are perhaps a bit more straight-forward than the Sigur R&oacute;s we are used to, but every song is loaded with a healthy dose of atmosphere.  By the time the closer \\"Var\\" comes around, it feels like we can finally rest.  It's a quiet, ambient track that gives listeners a chance to reflect - so much of Kveikur is loaded with business, it feels somewhat relieving to have this moment before circling around back to \\"Brennisteinn.\\"<br /><br />If you haven't liked anything you've heard by Sigur R&oacute;s so far, you probably won't find much on Kveikur to change your mind.  For fans of the band though, this album is a must-hear.  Don't let the lead track \\"Brennisteinn\\" scare you away - there's plenty here of the band you know and love, but there's also plenty that you've never heard from them before.  This might be my favorite of their's since 2005's Takk...<br /><br />Notable tracks to download/sample: \\"&Iacute;sjaki\\", \\"Yfirborð\\", and \\"Kveikur\\"

B009KS4XRO|2.0|It was ok at first but once you ran out of tickets you would have to buy more. You could win lots of coins but they would not let you buy tickets for more cards to play, you could only use the coins for power ups and keys to earn more tickets. But they don't give much of the tickets away. So I really don't like spending my money to just play a game.

B000002E5J|1.0|I bought this disk because I read that Shakira produced it.  I was anxious to see how her musical decision making in the studio changed the tunes as opposed to the decisions of a major label producer, who is just in there to create another marketable product with no concern for the INTENT music.  Certainly she would present her music framed exactly the way she wanted...?!<br />What I found was she made NO decisions...  No choices of interest at all..  No interesting arrangements, No real drummers (not a single one available in Columbia??  Not even a young one with something to prove...??) worse, no decent drum machine programming (If she can't program them, she didn't bother to find someone who could), no interesting backing vocals, no interesting instrumentation (where are the South American instruments and players?!), no killer studio musicians, nor up and coming players full of fire, no risks, no ANYTHING!!!<br />NONE of the hundreds of choices available to a music producer were actually MADE!!??  Not just bad decisions, but NO decisions of any kind...<br />The record is lifeless and boring... no musical texture, no scintillating performances, no anything...<br />It is like buying someones cake that they made before they went to work for Betty Crocker, so you could taste their product without the corporate influence, and the cake had no flavor and was like eating a crumbly sponge!!!!<br />This record has NO flavor... it isn't GOOD or BAD... it just is...<br />There are NO strong and not many weak choices on the entire record!!  The SOLE artistic choice she made was to yodel more...  not a big game changer.<br />I bought this to hear Shakira's musical creation without the corporate music influence and all I got was Wonder Bread with yawnable lyrics...<br />Horribly disappointed...<br />Boring and lifeless in a soul hurting way!

1478978082|5.0|Really good book, it was very intense and brought out the best of Bosch.  He sure does get pushed around a lot, could it be his cowboy attitude in solving crimes all by himself?  Who cares, this series is a favorite of mine.  This is a must read.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|I never hesitate to pick up a new Joe Satriani album, as he is one of my favorite guitarists of the last two decades. This one delivers well enough, but it is probably not his best work. I enjoyed listening to it, but it didn't leave me with anything truly memorable. Definitely better than \\"Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock\\" a few years back, but probably not as good as the late 1990s and early 2000s albums. If you're fan, then you should add it to your collection.
1600240003|5.0|When I get to the end of the series I do not think I will have one favorite I like them all.  Still have a few more to read but so far each one has been the best one.  Awesome series, I think Bosch must be a real detective somewhere.  These books are so realistic and very hard to put down.
B00C9U9YOW|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age is, in my opinion, one of the best rock bands ever, and I eagerly awaited this new album, especially the return of Mark Lanegan and Dave Grohl. I have to admit to being a little disappointed, though, with the final product. No question that it is a strong album with good songwriting, but it just doesn't have the punch of their earlier works. It definitely doesn't stand as strongly as \\"Songs for the Deaf,\\" \\"Lullabies to Paralyze,\\" or \\"Rated R.\\" I had wanted them to rock hard on this venture, and they didn't do so quite enough for my tastes. Still, it is a quality album, and I'm glad to own it. I was happy to see it ranked so highly on Amazon, too, since even the \\"worst\\" song by QOTSA is way better than almost anything on rock radio these days.

014241722X|1.0|Listened to this with my boys (ages 9 - 15) as a book on CD. Terrible!<br /><br />By the 4th and last disk, they were groaning and yelling at the narrator about how unbearable the book was. I was banging the steering wheel and biting my tongue to keep my audible feedback family friendly.<br /><br />The main plot was initially intriguing but got lamer and lamer. Grisham insults the intelligence of his readers, even child readers, with unnecessary repetitiveness and the most shallow of character development.<br /><br />Subplots were worse. Characters were introduced that were implied to be menacing and add suspense... THAT WENT NOWHERE!<br /><br />The real crime here is publishing such a lame series-starting book without putting a plot in it first. Reader beware!
