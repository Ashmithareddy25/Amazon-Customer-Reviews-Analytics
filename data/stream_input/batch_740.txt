B000K15VSA|5.0|Great set, really sets the bar for special editions. I ve had a good look around the special features including some of the commentaries and have been excessively pleased. The transfer and sound are stunning. A real treat.
B000TEUSJU|1.0|I saw this \\"film\\" in its original released and it haunts me to this day.  I remember some major cinema chains refused to show it and they were correct.  The only intriguing part was the idea that the cast made up a late seventies all-star team of British film actors who proved that money is truly everything by agreeing to be part of this thing.    I recall the review in the Boston Phoenix at the time which, if I am paraphrasing it correctly, said something like: Garbage over time equals swill; swill in great quantity equals poison.      Run away...
B000TUXL2A|4.0|this one requires a little longer attention span, hence the bad reviews by some of the people here who needed to get back to their IPods - programming and consuming more music.  I took me a while to get drawn in.  Shangri La is so perfect, MK might have peaked and knew it was hard to top with the same setup.  Or maybe he is working on another one of that magnitude....  So why not go a little folksy?   The songs are subtle, blunt and beautiful.  Less is more works perfect here. And it's not really less - just sounds like it the first couple of times~  4.5 Stars, close to 5./
B000VBJEEG|1.0|My family and I sat down and watched the entire movie but it was a waste of time.  We couldn't get past the fact that rats were preparing the food, YUCKY!  It was boring in the middle and could have ended better.  Not a good pixar movie.
B000002GK1|5.0|used to have acces to this cd when I lived with my brother, he left and so did the cd :-(  a few years and a few dollars later and I'm sure glad to have it back
B000K7VHQE|5.0|This will become a classic. It captures the struggle and dysfunction of the American family. Very funny.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|[[ASIN:B000VBJEEG Ratatouille]]<br />I bought this for my grand daughters, thinking this was another kids' movie. This is a surprisingly poignant and adult-pleasing gem. We will repeat-viewing this new piece in our DVD collection. Even a good \\"date movie\\" choice!
0195145925|4.0|I find many of the reviews useful and well considered but there are a number where it is obvious that the reviewer either didn't read the book or didn't understand it.    Today there are two major schools of physics; quantum theory and relativity.  In quantum mechanics space and time must exist on their own.  One example is the neutrino.  In the standard model (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model) there are the electron, muon and tau neutrinos.  For years physicists have tried to study the sun by the neutrinos it emits but there were way fewer than predicted.  Last year that problem finally got resolved by the discovery that neutrinos act much more like waves than expected.  They change from electron to muon to tau depending on the phase of the wave instead of staying electron as theory predicted.  To do this space and time must exist separate from the neutrinos.    In General Relativity time and space dimensions only exist as metrics--that is to the extent that they measure relationships between things; be the things sub atomic particles or galaxies.  They have no independent existence.    This dichotomy is why when physicists try to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity they come with silliness like particles traveling backward in time from the edge of the universe. (This to try to reconcile Stephen Hawking's application of quantum mechanics to black holes and finding that they radiate mass to eliminate spin and to decrease their mass.)    The author takes on the one real remaining problem with time and that is time asymmetry.  IMHO the  explanation he gives is a valid one although conceptually difficult and not again IMHO complete.  I could wish that Feynman had addressed the topic as he had a excellent talent for getting complex concepts across.  But he refused to have his views on time attributed to him or have them published. Considering the beating Fred Hoyle took over \\"Symmetric Electrodynamics in Arrow of time Cosmology\\" he was probably right.Overall this is an interesting book and a good read although hard going conceptually.  Luckily the math is simple trig.
0300108834|5.0|Since other reviewers have hit most of the high points of this book -- its comprehensiveness, its accessible style, its suitability for reading aloud, etc. -- I'll focus on one little-discussed aspect: its respect for religion.  Gombrich has no interest in proselytizing his readers; you will find no arguments on behalf of any particular religion in this book.  Yet he appreciates that without \\"cult\\" there is no culture, and that religion has been the driving force of all civilizations.  The world's major religious figures, e.g., Christ, Buddha, and Mohammed, are discussed in detail and presented fairly.  We've been reading aloud a few chapters a week for about a month, and my children, especially the sixth-, fourth- and first-graders, have profited enormously from it.
B000UJ48O0|4.0|Most people know all about the show (which is why they're looking at this product in the first place), so I'll get right into discussing the presentation. For more information on the case, you can see the pictures I've included above.    Inside:  - Each season is color coded.  - Each season has every episode listed, along with the writers and directors of the episode, the date aired, and a plot sypnosis.  - Also included are promotional cast pictures for each season.  - Each season has an \\"extras\\" DVD which has all the gag reels, sneak peaks, introspectives, etc., that correspond to the season. However, some season discs have additional content that is not included on the extras DVDs. -- For example, the 1st disc of Season One has commentary by the creator, \\"A Look at the O.C. Music Guide\\" and \\"The Model Home\\" as extra features which are not found on the extras disc.     Discs:  - There are several discs for each season.   - There is a little pocket for each disc to go into in the cardboard case. However, I find this to be not very intuitive. First of all, I never had the problem of discs falling out -- in fact I had the opposite problem! Some discs are jammed in so hard, that I can't pull them out. Secondly, sliding discs in and out of cardboard (however smooth it may be) worries me. The pockets are not coated with anything soft, and I'm afraid that my discs are going to get scratched if I keep pulling them in and out. Aesthetically it's appealing, practicality-wise it's not.  - However, everything is organized beautifully despite that, and it's very easy to flip back and refer to each episode written inside the case.    The Content:  - The gag reels are hilarious, although the music seems to drown out the dialog on some of them.   - Subtitles (French, Spanish, English) are available.  - Everything is nicely presented. Menus are not complicated. I've had no audio problems (aside from the gag reels), blurry pictures, frozen menus, or anything like that.    Overall,this is definitely a good collectors set, and has a lot of extra content that should keep you occupied for hours. My only problem with this set was the disc storage, and for that it loses 1 star.
B000EULJLU|5.0|They definitely stepped up their use of technology.  I find that their singles that are on the radio are my least favorite songs on the album probably. Not their best album but it's great.
B000HBKCDC|3.0|Very pretty, atmospheric tunes, but I wouldn't recommend if you're feeling down. It'll just depress you even more. Too melancholy if you're prone to winter blues. Otherwise, listen up and enjoy. Lovely for background music while wrapping gifts or hosting a small, mellow party.
0684865130|4.0|A group of my friends went to Stockton State College to see a theater presentation of Catch-22. We all decided to reread the novel;all of us had read the book in high school english.  The times have changed. There is a very pro military culture in the United States today.  I think Heller's satire is probably closer to the truth about the efficiency of the military. The people who 'liberated' Iraq will be postal workers in about ten years. And not very good ones either.   There are good wars that must be fought, one must concede. Most of the time,however, it is just male ego and ambition run amok. You might say, what if everyone felt that way?  Then I'd be a damned fool to feel otherwise.
B000VS6QTK|4.0|Excellent sound quality, and a great concert. Picture quality as good   as one can expect from a concert from the early 90'. If you are an AC/DC fan and got a PS3 / blue ray player this is a must have..
1595141715|5.0|It's been quite a while since I've read something that stayed with me long after reading it. THIRTEEN REASONS WHY is this kind of book. If you're interested in reading a literary novel that gets you thinking, put this one on your shopping list. And like many others who have reviewed this book, I, too, found it very hard to put down.     I'd love to say more about the plot and characters, but I'm not going to be accused of giving anything way. You simply must read it for yourself.    Kudos to Jay Asher for delivering an unforgettable, high-quality novel for teens and adults alike.
B000SZZIH2|5.0|I don't care when it was recorded. I don't care who recorded it. Nor how it compares to the Beatles. Pet Sounds is a perfect recording any way you can measure it. I didn't appreciate it when it first came out, but years later, I again heard it and could not believe what I was hearing. Could this really be the poppy Beach Boys? This essentially solo Brian Wilson recording is so superior in so many ways: melody, lyric, arrangement, production, that no other album/CD comes to mind to equal it. Many have come very close. But Pet Sounds holds together so tightly both musically and emotionally that it has no peers. It really is the greatest popular recording to date.
B000YPUF9W|3.0|The Resident Evil games, developed by Capcom, is probably my favorite franchise of the \\"survivor horror\\" genre since they were actually fun to play whereas series like Silent Hill or Fatal Frame were just simply fun to watch someone else play. The Resident Evil films, largely overseen by Paul W.S Anderson, are probably the only real decent videogame adaptations since you can enjoy them with your brain turned off whereas ones like Doom or Dead or Alive don't make the movie any better. The third film, Extinction, is just as polarizing as the 2 before it as a lot of it doesn't feel like the games yet it mentions stuff from it yet it's somehow enjoyable. Why that is, I'll never know.    Despite the destruction via nuclear missile of Raccoon City, the T-Virus escaped and infected the rest of America and the rest of the world, leaving many turned into zombies and the lands barren wastelands. Alice, on the run since the Umbrella Corporation can track her whereabouts via satellite, is roaming the lands trying to help those in need and she comes across Claire Redfield and Carlos Olivera from Apocalypse, travelling via convoys for supplies, ammunition and a haven. But Umbrella and one of its scientists, Dr. Isaacs, wants to contain the virus and the only way to do that is by killing Alice and using for a vaccine. With hopes of an isolated haven, Alice and the others try to stay alive in the harsh heat and hunted by more deadlier enemies.    Let's face it: the films tonally just never meshed with the games. Whereas the game franchise was built on eerie, creepy atmospheres, the films have heavy metal music, over-editing and big action scenes. But like when you were a kid and you got those cookies in the shapes of your favorite characters, it doesn't really matter what they are as long as they had familiar faces so when Carlos and Claire pop up, it's more cooler but then again the basic feel of the films feel different from the game so there's the issue. From plot holes to barely-written characters to flimsy dialogue, there's stuff to like but it's nestled right alongside tons of stuff to loathe.    The first film is probably one of the better made of the series (again, saying the series, not film in general) but Apocalypse had more familiar fanservice nods to the games such as Carlos, Jill Valentine, Nemesis and the Ashford family and Extinction is similar and acting-wise this is never meant to be actor showcases of talent, we just need faces for our story and with Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr and Ali Larter playing Alice, Carlos and Claire, it's easy for fans to get attached to it; it's just what the film does with it and how much you like it or hate it is the key. The effects are more seamless, the scope is more bigger, and thankfully there's more action so for the most part, if you liked the other 2, it's a good chance you'll like this one as well.    Included with the film is a commentary as well as trailers for the games Umbrella Chronicles and Devil May Cry 4, the CG film Degeneration (which looks awesome), deleted scenes and a decent making-of on the film. It's not as stacked as most high-profile releases but it's not as barebones as most are so at least there's more stuff to dig into. As for the film itself, like a lot of videogame adaptations, it's fun to a fault and with flaws galore, they're still fun to watch...if only you could figure out why that is.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I bought this when it was only $20 so it was a steal!!!! 9 discs so much stuff I don't think I will ever watch it all.  Please note I am not a huge Alien fan so this could be a bad collection, but  it works for me.  I haven't watched them all but it is nice that some of the versions had their sound reformatted.  It stinks watching a movie in Stereo.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|Well . . . . it's not a throwback to \\"The Bends,\\" as the early critics raved.       I think that threw me off on first listen.          It actually reminds me of Beck's \\"Sea Change\\" -- quiet, thoughtful, and melancholic but not angry.  Like Beck, Radiohead changes gears from each song being a different experiment to each song being a quiet variation on the last.  Both albums are like one huge song or a symphony.       Also, like \\"Sea Change,\\" \\"In Rainbows\\" follows a heavily experimental album that was an amalgam of the artists' previous albums.  Instead, we get a stripped down, almost completely acoustic album.  I know \\"Sea Change\\" disappointed Beck fans, and I almost felt that way about \\"In Rainbows,\\" but 20 plays later, I'm converted.  I'm not sure this album will ever get as much play as their others (I usually choose another Beck CD over \\"Sea.\\")  It is a need to be in the right mood album.  And I'm in the right mood right now.
B000IOM0WY|1.0|I'll keep this short.  The movie itself is fantastic.  However, I would surmise that this Blu Ray was ported back when Sony thought that MPEG-2 was the best codec for HD video.  Now that they've had to fall in line with HD DVD and use VC-1 for most of their transfers, the quality of this movie is poor at best.  I've compared this version to both the DVD and the HD DVD version and both are superior to this version.  The artifacts and quality in general is atrocious.      Unfortunately, this is the problem with BluRay right now.  They have hundreds of great movies out there that were encoded using MPEG2 and they look terrible.  They need to go back and remaster all of these movies because they are not even on par with DVD quality.
1573229725|5.0|I've read Fingersmith three or four times in the past month.  Sarah Waters's plot is elegant in the way that Brian Greene says the universe is elegant.  Her characters are believable and intriguing, and quite far removed from the cookie-cutter characters seen in so many novels today (especially of the mystery/suspense persuasion).  While Fingersmith may not typically be billed as either mystery or suspense, it is.  Waters's plot twists make it so.  Indeed, the word \\"twist\\" is quite appropriate to describe the hairpin turns the plot takes at key points.<br /><br />The lesbian aspect of the novel is a subtle, yet necessary force.  Not as underplayed as it is in Affinity but not the singular force it is in Tipping the Velvet either.  The descriptions by each narrator of the consummation of the relationship are poetic yet well within the voice of each character.  Waters's talent and her ear are evident throughout the book.  As lesbian novels go, there is no comparison between Fingersmith and, say, Rita Mae Brown's Alma Mater.  Both tell of young women falling in love, but Fingersmith is rich, textured, surprising; Alma Mater is flat, pedestrian, predictable.<br /><br />Finally, after reading Fingersmith, you might enjoy watching the BBC production on DVD starring Sally Hawkins as Sue and Elaine Cassidy as Maud.  Both women are excellent in their roles as is Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake; Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix).  As with any dramatization of a book, it is not as faithful as one might like it (e.g., Cassidy is dark where Maud is supposedly fair) but it manages to capture the essence of the book quite well.  Better, I think, than the BBC production of Tipping the Velvet did with that particular novel.
0385340559|2.0|I have enjoyed reading the fantasy world of the fictional character Jack Reacher; ex-military cop tough guy & investigator. To my knowledge I have read all of the sequels to date.  This latest book was a bit of a disappointment (and likely my last purchase) as the author chose to add to this fictional character a seemingly unnecessary hostile attitude toward anything biblical as well as adding plugs for the controversial PETA organization (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). For this reader the series is fantasy entertainment only - the politically correct content was a surprise and disappointment.
B000VSBX34|5.0|After the overnight success of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", there was just no stopping the \\"runaway train\\" known as the Beatles. But instead of giving us AHDN knockoff, director Richard Lester & the boys aimed for something different: A footloose adventure delving into \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" surrealism, wrapped around a James Bond-like spoof. And in COLOR, no doubt!   Ringo--the \\"quiet\\" Beatle--is the centerpiece of this film, having the misfortune of wearing a sacred & valuable ring sought after by a religious cult, mad scientists & other assorted characters. But this movie is more significant than people realize, for it preceded the zany antics of Monty Python by a few years (witness the off-the-wall \\"intermission\\" plot break that could've been easily used by Python!). For four musicians, the Beatles solidify their status as \\"the English cousins of the Marx Brothers\\", living in a zany, surrealistic apartment, shrinking Paul down to gum-wrapper size (you have to see it to believe it) and poking fun at all the so-called \\"danger\\" around them.   And of course, there are the musical interludes in the film, hinting at what would come with the music video revolution.                        The film's carefree exuberance is another example of why John, Paul, George & Ringo are so-much loved all over the planet.   The DVD restoration of this film is simply remarkable; it looks as if it was just filmed yesterday. \\"Help\\" is going to be a real keeper for generations to come!
B000TLTUL0|5.0|This movie has everything, drama, angst, suspense, tragedy, and even humor, though it be very dark, it's still funny. Lots of blood that's more symbolic than anything that's supposed to be real, at it's heart this is a story about passion. Passion for lost love, revenge, and longing. Depp is at his best, Burton is at his best, Carter is pretty good, and the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. A must see. I'm going to reserve a copy of this ASAP so I can get it and watch it over and over again.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I finally did it.  I got him to watch a chick flick.  Despite Mr. Bronson's constants groans of pain and disgust, he watched the whole thing (and survived!).  This is one of my favorite movies of all time so it really meant a lot that I was able to share it with him.  After 7 months of horror flicks, a little change was nice (i love you honey).<br /><br />There's not much I can say about this movie that someone else hasn't already written.  I love the music, the dancing is awesome, and the story is well written.  For the longest time, I'd always cry at the end of the movie because, gosh darn it, I wanted my happy ending!  Finding it (my happy ending) with Mr. Bronson made me look at it in a completely different way.<br /><br />I'm done be mushy, I promise!  I'm making myself sick with the immense sappiness of it all.
B000VR824S|4.0|This is truly a fantastic concert DVD. Sound and video are all great quality. Extras are extremely interesting for those who attended and those who did not. I would have liked to see/hear more songs included but what is there is powerful stuff. Seeing Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton on stage together after so many years was a wonderful sight to see! I would recommend this DVD to fans of Blind Faith, Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton along with Johnny Winter who does his fabulous rendition of Highway 61 Revisted (the man's still got it!). It is so great to see/hear Rock, Blues, Country, and Folk all in one show and enjoying every minute of it.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|\\"Warchest\\" is a great example of knowing your audience. Most, if not all Megadeth fans already have all the albums, so it's not a compilation of every studio track from A-Z. It includes highlights from each record, but is also stuffed with previously unreleased live songs, studio demos, outtakes, and even an entire 1992 DVD show from London.<br /><br />In-between A-Z, you get a complete, well-rounded Megadeth timeline through the years, in and out of the studio, concert stage, and even interview clips. If you own other boxed sets, you know that not many bands can pull this off without scraping the barrel. Megadeth does it effortlessly.<br /><br />One of my favorites here is the demo version of \\"Five Magics.\\" The song is stripped down from an overdub standpoint, and doesn't have the incredible solo at the end as it appears on \\"Rust In Peace.\\"<br /><br />Instead, you get the powerful backing riff laid bare front and center, over and over, sounding like a musical speeding train. The rhythm guitar underneath the solo is strong enough to to stand on its own as a lead, and it's a template that repeats itself throughout their catalog. These are solid, densely-crafted songs from start to finish, and almost nothing is disposable.<br /><br />Another highlight is the furious, gritted-teeth guitar tone on the demos for \\"Holy Wars\\", \\"Architecture of Aggression\\" and \\"Breakpoint.\\" Incredibly raw, and different sounding than the album versions.<br /><br />There's a picture in the booklet (which is also impressive) of the \\"United Abominations\\" lineup, with both Drover brothers. I'm sure at the time \\"Warchest\\" was being put together, Dave had planned for that lineup to be around for while. But now that Glen has left the band, I wonder if it was really necessary to include that picture, especially since there are no songs from that foursome on any of the discs.<br /><br />Given Megadeth's history of revolving-door personnel, it's kind of amazing that the Mustaine/Friedman/Ellefson/Menza lineup stayed together for almost ten years. That's the ensemble that makes up most of this collection.
B000002LLC|5.0|madonna is always great no matter what. This was a great album and is full of swagger and class. LISTEN TO IT.
B00092ZMDY|1.0|I had seen this prior to ordering - Awesome concert - however, I purchased 2 DVDs for gifts from Amazon and neither worked.  I have shipped back for refund and re-purchased them from Best Buy, which I will do in the future.  No more DVD purchases from AMAZON.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|At the time, people thought Madonna went too far. This album was still great and way ahead of its time. Listen, to it and I know you will agree. However, this album was great because it had dance appeal and a lot of rhythm and blues music. If you notice, it has some influence of music on the last song and some other songs of we call neo-soul of next generation soul music. Get the album for true Madonna fans out there.
B00005JPFH|4.0|While I didn't think Spider-Man 3 (SM 3) was as good as the second film, it still was very good and met most of my expectations.  The action sequences were amazing, and the franchise really outdid itself in this respect.  The acting was also very good.  Maybe not quite as good as the second film, but still good.  The villains in this film were cool, but not quite as nasty and intense like Dr. Octopus in #2.  As a big Venom fan, I was disappointed that Venom didn't receive more screen time.  To me, it would have made more sense to focus more on the Venom story rather than Sandman since fans of the franchise love Venom a lot more than Sandman.    I think the hype leading up to the showing of this film hurt it in many ways.  The second film's pacing was different in that it started out quickly, then slowed down, then sped up again.  It was kind of like a rollercoaster in terms of what was going on.  In contrast, this film starts out slow, while its audience is ready for some hard core Spidey scenes right away.  SM 3 took a different approach where the pace gradually picked up as the film progressed, which I think hurt the film's reviews.    Overall, SM 3 was not quite as good as #2, but it is still a worthy addition to the franchise.  I had a feeling this film would not be able to match the quality of the second film, considering Spider-Man 2 was heralded by many as \\"the best superhero movie ever.\\"    Bottom Line: Buy the DVD and watch it again.  You'll probably like it more than you did when you saw it in the theater.
B00005JPNW|3.0|I saw the movie of \\"The Golden Compass\\" before reading the book, though I had read news articles about the controversy over the making of it.  I wanted to like the film, being impressed with the story's highly original ideas, and by its strong young heroine as a champion for freedom of thought.  Yet, I was bothered by a number of things.      One was the all-too-obvious CGI effects, which made the alternate universe in which the story is set look less realistic and more cartoonish than it should have.  A more skilled director than Chris Weitz(Alfonso Cuaron for instance) could have worked wonders with some of the visual set pieces that the book provides.      Another was knowing that some of Weitz's deviations from Philip Pullman's novel were made, not for cinematic reasons, but as self-censorship.  His  attempt to make the story less offensive to religious groups, who were opposed to the novels, made the story less coherent, and the religious groups came out against the movie anyway.     The big surprise coming in a way that's very close to a very famous scene in a very famous film.  (The book reveals the surprise much earlier and in a different, though, admittedly, less cinematic way.)    Then there was the awkward non-ending, which left people in the audience I saw it with feeling cheated.  It also violated one of the prime directives of screenwriting:  show, don't tell.  We're told what happened to Lord Asriel instead of getting a climactic scene with him.     Not so, in Pullman's version, which I just finished reading.  The final scenes of the book are astounding, and they end with a cliffhanger more cinematic than anything in the movie.  By failing to incorporate these scenes into the film, and cutting off the story where he did, Weitz effectively cut his movie off from its daemon.  \\"Just a little cut,\\" one might say.  But this cut was fatal.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Product was exactly what i wanted. Came in a new case with disks that were not scratched. Arrived on time. What more could you ask for? David Attenborough kicks a**!
B000BW7QWW|3.0|\\"Serenity\\" refers to one of two things - it's the name of a run-down space-going freighter captained by Mal. Reynolds.  It was also the name of a valley where was fought the final battle against The Alliance for control of space.  In the distant future, with Earth being a vague memory, The Alliance is dominant.  Control of planets and interstellar travel is almost entirely within the Alliance's domain.  Serenity and her tight-knit crew spend much of their time in that realm of \\"almost\\".  The only other possible contender for domination of the stars is the \\"Reavers\\" - a mysterious group of monstrously violent humans who treat their victims with unspeakable brutality, sort of like a cross between Klingons and the Evil Dead.  outwardly, Reynolds seems dispassionate about interstellar freedom - with his crew, he takes on \\"jobs\\" that straddle (at best) the law, and he's not up to fighting another losing battle with the now all-powerful Alliance.  In this feature film, Reynolds must now take on The Alliance, forced to protect his passenger - River Tam - from them.  Augmented by Alliance technology, River is something of a super-being intended as some kind of weapon.  Rescued by her brother from an Alliance lab before the original series began, River is now the subject of this flick.  Pursued across by the Alliance, Reynolds's only hope is a mysterious world that the Alliance does not control - one deep inside Reaver territory.    I really wanted to like this flick, which displays some pretty crisp dialog for a sci-fi flick, but never really comes together.  Gina Torres and Adam Baldwin rock the action better than they did in \\"Alias\\" and \\"Chuck\\" respectively, but \\"Serenity\\" doesn't suffer from a lack of \\"rock\\" - rather it's one of those flicks that people want to make, but never actually put together.  The story gives us a disarmingly sinister character called \\"The Operative\\" who's assigned to recover River Tam for The Alliance.  The problem is, we never get a sense (in the movie anyway) as to what The Alliance really stands for - we just sort of assume that they're some authoritarian outfit, the type seen in countless TV shows, films and video games.  Mal & the Operative share some interesting banter when they first meet, but the Operative is smart enough to recognize stalling-for-time when he hears it, and tactless enough to clue us in.  Their next face-to-face meeting is a fight, which debases the film into a kind of video game, an RPG where meetings result in either conversation or combat.      The story's biggest weakness is that it seldom feels like it's going anywhere - a plot-thread about River becomes a thread about the Reavers, glued together by the angst of the crew and (ineffectually) by a shared fear or hatred of the Alliance.  These threads would have been best served by arcing plots on a running TV show (yeah, we know it WAS a show, and that it was cancelled while inferior and over-hyped shows and reality TV survived, but don't blame us - it's not our fault!!).  These same plot threads feel awkwardly compressed in a feature film, like an overstuffed suitcase.  Worst of all, the script bathes itself and its characters in a form of sentimentality that deservedly rewards fans of the show, but just confuses those like us who were hoping to discover it with this flick.  Most of the time, the characters have this fun and easygoing rappaport, (the best lines go to, are aimed at or are about Torres and Baldwin, natch), but then get serious and heroic, even though the script doesn't really establish why these guys care about anything or how they can embody such a range of morals and emotion.  In short, the flick appeaars to pick up where the series left off.  I'm going to give the franchise the benefit of the doubt and just guess that what's missing in this movie is simply included in the episodes of the show - so if you are going to get into \\"Serenity\\", it probably helps to have watched at least most of the show that it's based on.  I'll leave it to the bloggers to decide whether a stand-alone movie is too much to ask, but in this case, it's more than you can expect.
1400063515|5.0|I happen to work with software project estimation. Taleb's latest book has a special message for estimators in general and I found it entertaining, intriguing, frightening, and useful at the same time! Chapter 10, appropriately titled \\"The Scandal of Prediction\\", reminds us that predicting anything remains a hopeless task for most of us. Yes, we may do quite well on the average, but now and then a Black Swan (an improbable event) will come out of the blue and get us. Starting with the Sydney Opera House construction project originally estimated at AU$ 7 million that ended up costing AU$ 104 million, Taleb reminds us that we should be very humble when prediction of any kind is involved. Some of his controversial ideas about prediction: someone who has less information may be a better estimator than someone who has more;  experts have a very poor assessment of their ability to predict - they tend to believe they are much better than they really are; and more. Taleb provides explanations and references for most of his peculiar ideas. He may convince you, or not. But it is worth reading.<br /><br />Taleb lists the excuses used by forecasters when caught (most of the time they are not - few people actually compare actuals to estimates. Do you?). Some say they were \\"playing a different game\\", meaning some \\"exogenous\\" event took place. So if you are, say, a social scientist you may put the blame for a poor prediction on economic factors, since they are outside your domain of expertise. If you are a software project estimator like me you may blame the budget overrun on the project leader who left the company without warning (how could you predict THAT?). Alas, that does not fix the problem.<br /><br />Also, as Taleb points out, projections usually do not come with a \\"possible error rate\\" attached to their scenarios. Not knowing a projection's variability rate is like trying to cross a river four feet deep on average only to fall into a seven feet hole. The average depth is still four feet... but that does not change anything once you're in the hole, does it?<br /><br />How would you solve that problem? Taleb tells estimators to get another job. He adds, \\"Anyone who causes harm by forecasting should be treated as either a fool or a liar\\", period. If you do not mind shaking your beliefs now and then, brace yourself and dive into this book. I did and loved it. Good luck.... but that does not change anything once you're in the hole, does it?

B0000025H0|3.0|Marathon shows Santana in pure pop/rock mode. It's such a departure from their earlier albums that if weren't for Carlos Santana's guitar and the occasional percussion and keyboard break, you wouldn't even know it's a Santana album. Having said that, Marathon isn't terrible, it's just not up to their previous high standards. The best song is the hit ballad, \\"You Know That I Love You\\", an excellent track that barely grazed the U.S. Top 40. The dramatic \\"Lightning in the Sky\\" is also pretty good as is the instrumental \\"Aqua Marine\\", which would have fit in well on the band's fusion albums (Caravanserai, Welcome, and Borboletta). The remaining instrumentals; \\"Runnin\\" and the title track, are also decent albeit way too short. The rest of the songs like \\"All I Ever Wanted\\", \\"Summer Lady\\", and \\"Stay (Beside Me)\\" are okay but are so distinguishable that you could say they were recorded by another band and not know the difference. Overall, Santana have released a lot of albums better than Marathon but at least it's better than the \\"Carlos Santana & Special Guests\\" albums he's been putting out for the last decade.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|The most poetic, hard-hitting, melodic and harmonically engaging songs he has written sabotaged through audio engineering. I assume it is over-compression that has taken the definition and fidelity out of all the instruments, doing a great disservice to these brilliant musicians. I can't understand why this recording has not been recalled.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I can't see what the big stink is about this flick.  It stink, stank, stunk!  I have never been depressed in all my 44 years. In fact, I didn't even know what people were experiencing who took anti-depressants, but after I saw this movie, I not only understood depression, but I understood suicide as well. I simply don't see what the point is. We ALL know that drugs are bad for you, why would anyone want to watch 2 hours of people going down the drain, when all you've got to do is turn on the evening news for 2 minutes?  After Pi, a very strange but captivating movie in its own right, I had big expectations for this one, but no, no, no, no, no!  This is a huge pile of garbage, don't waste your time, your money, or your sanity!

B00012FXB8|4.0|Alien 3  DVD<br /><br />This third entry in the series has Ripley, Newt, our surviving Colonial Marine, and Bishop in pretty dire straits after escaping LV-426.  They have a little problem in with the crash landing. This kills two of the three residents in their stasis pods right away and trashes the synthetic Bishop beyond salvage ability,<br />This leaves Ripley sitting amongst the residents of a prison planet that has been tucked away and forgotten. Still, she's safe because there aren't any creatures on this rock, right? Unbeknownst to her or the residents of this unarmed rock (unless you call a few flares, some flammable liquid, and some hand tools having weaponry), however, she did bring a little bundle of joy into the fold here and, more importantly, she herself finds that perhaps, in this big misadventure, that she has finally managed to step into a pothole of gargantuan proportions.<br />As far as the Alien series (or Legacy, as the box set indicates) goes, this movie is oftentimes cast off as something that is worth forgetting. In many ways this is because it is a reversion toward the die cast in the first movie and forgotten in the second, where only one alien menaces a group of people instead of an armada of them and where the people find themselves without enough \\"heat\\" to \\"pack.\\" Still, being a fan of the idea and of the furthering of the Alien concept, I didn't exactly see it in that light. Instead of seeing it as a reversion in any sense, I saw the storyline as something that explored the outskirts of the society that they had landed within as it explored how the people managed to get along and the power structure involved therein. This touched on their belief system, the fact that even a hairless (because of the little Lice problem that the planet has) Ripley can be considered a supermodel amongst a colony of forgotten \\"lifers,\\" and that they find someone shouting \\"Xeno\\" much the same as anyone else would. Further, it explores the way the Alien adapts to its host, showing you the body difference in the beasties that come from the atypical human model vs. something that manages to come from an animal like a dog. With the dogburster this requires a little creative ingenuity and it looked pretty good, holding the characteristics of its kind and its host's body type quite nicely.<br />The only problems I had with the whole thing was that Newt, someone we had to watch salvaged from the jaws of a Queen in the 2nd installation, is dead on arrival and doesn't really give while the giving is good, and that the Alien's view is sometimes shot through its eyes. Personally, I thought this was something of an insult to the people that watched Ripley trudge through the depths of LV-426 for what amounted to futility, and I wanted to see something tragic happen besides drowning in a stasis chamber. Also, the view of the alien, while interesting when it's running up walls, is something that you have to be in the mood for. It does add an odd prospective to the viewing, but I'd sometimes like to watch the man and monstrosity meet in an awe-inspiring puddle of fear-driven demise.<br />This is a movie that I like in quite a few ways, but that I know isn't exactly the most embraced chapter in the storyline. It doesn't involve the dripping of acidic blood in most of its chapters, the alien decides to check in and say hello when it feels the need, and you really don't get anything like you did in Aliens. So, saying that you will or won't like it is something of a rocky road. If you were a fan of the first two then you should get this one,also.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of Sigourney Weaver, the slimy reptillian creature and the alien quadrilogy.<br /><br />Gunner  January, 2008t, showing you the body difference in the beasties that come from the atypical human model vs. something that manages to come from an animal like a dog.

0143038583|5.0|This book was more intriguing, more interesting, more insightful, and more entertaining than I expected it to be.  I thought it would be a completely out-in-left-field book full of impossible suggestions to things I didn't even consider problems.  Instead, the author went about exploring in a very informative way, merely offering observations without being self-righteous or preachy.  It did change the way I look at, if not food itself, the way it gets to me, and thinking of things I can do about that.  My family got a little tired of me starting conversations with, \\"in this book I'm reading...\\"  Definitely recommended!
B000XCZGVI|5.0|david fincher has made the two best serial killer movies of all time.  Seven was a masterpiece of urban depression and the pathological tendencies that can arise from living in such a miserable place.  Seven was filled with \\"cool\\" images and methods of killing people.  It was a fun movie.  Zodiac is the flip side.  it is a serious movie, methodically told about how hard it is to find the identity of a serial killer, especially in the days before DNA testing.  it is a beautiful movie and can be haunting and exhilirating and frustrating all at the same time.  this will be a movie that will be long remembered.  all the big budget movies of 2007 (spiderman, shrek, transformers) will all be forgotten in a few years.  Zodiac will live on for years because it is an intelligent movie.
B000UX6THK|3.0|My one and only complaint about the set is that Discs 4 and 6 have factory defects in the episode menus.  Everyone should be made aware of this.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no recourse for the consumer to rectify this either.  So, if you are ok with some minor menu defects, go ahead and buy it..
1594200823|5.0|This book is fantastic!  I read it about six months ago, and I still quote it and think about what I learned all the time.  A must read!
B000ZJTPLG|4.0|Got this for Christmas, and it is  a lot of fun. The sound is very warm an tube-like, unlike the old compressed-to-death SRD Rockman tone of the 80's. The gain can be turned down for a clean tone, but when turned up, it has a very nice distortion. The only feature missing is reverb, as it only delivers a studio dry tone. One drawback is that it swings around  in the jack, but I'm not sure how it can be avoided. Also, it was actually refreshing to see \\"Made in Japan\\" label- as opposed to some of the shotty Chinese made products. If it had reverb I would give it 5 stars. Pretty cool to walk all over the house and be able to jam, and a nagging spouse is easily drowned out! :)
B000I2J0VK|5.0|One of the best Tom Cruise movies !  If you love thrillers, mysteries - this movie has it all.  All of the other actors are fabulous.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Having shared a similar experience during WW2 in Holland,I found this movie really outstandig in every possible aspect!  The story (based on true facts)is filmed in a most reallistic manner and the multi language utillization makes it even more so especially for an ex  Dutchman(presenly Israeli)like myself being fluent in all 4 languages used.  The acting of all major characters is superb and needless to say that I fully reccomend this film to everyone!
B000AMJC2K|3.0|I ordered this LCD Arm for my new 22\\" Samsung monitor for Christmas. The monitor arrived in time for Christmas but I was shocked when I inspected it. The arm was scratched and scuffed and almost all the screws were stripped. Almost as if the people assembling this thing had no idea the arm was meant to be ADJUSTABLE. Frustrated over the appearance and poor assembly I called Amazon and they promptly sent me a new product.    Unfortunately, while the new arm did NOT have the scuffs and scratches, I suffered the same issues with the amount of force the people assembling this arm used on the screws. To give you an idea of how much force I'm talking about, I broke the allen wrench that came with the monitor stand....IN HALF...trying to loosen one of the screws so I could adjust the monitor angle. The wrench began to bend and warp until I literally twisted the end off. Thinking the included wrench was inferior, I moved on to my trusty Craftsman wrenches and successfully ruined 2 of them as well (I'm counting on that lifetime warranty to reimburse me). I still havent gotten it off, and even if I do the screw is ruined because its so stripped.    What I dont understand is why the arm is assembled at all. The package includes instructions on assembly so it would make sense that I just got parts. I guess somebody thinks they're doing me a favor.    Thats a lot of detail for a simple conclusion. Mine was assembled by the World's Strongest Man or possibly a very weak man who felt he needed to compensate for something. This LCD arm is useless if my monitor is stuck at a 45degree angle to my desk. I bought mine directly from Amazon. Hopefully other vendors have done a better job of assembly - and if you're lucky - its not assembled at all.
B000UDJS2S|5.0|Ghost Rider might not be to some peoples liking, but for me it was great.  I love Nicholas Cage, Peter Fonda and Sam Elliott.  I was so involved with the special effects that I had to see it a second time before I knew what the plot was about, and good beats evil is always a good plot.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|I love Scifi it's my fave genre.  I'm into anything that's cyber, fantastic, space faring, laser guns, aliens - whatever - as long as the storyline is good.  For those who enjoy the tame fare of Star Trek, Eureka, Kyle XY, Babylon 5, BSG to a degree (although edgier and darker)and all the other family favourites (which I do totally) and you want something darker, different, adventurous then you've got Far Scape, Firefly and then go totally whack and you get Torchwood the fantastic Doctor Who spin off.  And Doctor Who rocks big time.  I grew up with Doctor Who, Blake 7, Red Dwarf and other British fare so it's great to see this type of show.    Don't take it too seriously, just enjoy it for what it is.  Yup there are a few holes in the first season, all the series and movies have them but I love the series and all the characters, the aliens, the interpersonal relationships - looking forward to Season 2.

0812975219|1.0|This book contains approximately two hundred pages of the author bragging about himself and perhaps 30 pages of insights into the role of chance in life and the markets.<br />Much of the book reads like an autobiography of the author, about how well travelled and how well read he is, along with some gloating about other traders who lost their shirts due to inferior trading strategies.<br />He is quick to point out how other people's trading strategies, if successful, can normally be attributed to luck, but fails to point out that the same could be said of his own methods.<br />Wherever he does provide some insights into randomness, there's really nothing that hasn't been written many times before by other authors.<br />If you really want to read a fascinating account of this subject, check out Peter Bernstein's \\"Against the Gods\\". There you'll find plenty of insights into Gambling, Capital Markets, Probability Theory etc, without the self-obsessed, elitist rambling which you'll find here.<br />Other recommended books on the subject :<br />Capital Ideas (again, by Peter Bernstein) similar in content to Against the Gods, but focussing more specifically on financial markets;<br />Fortune's Formula by William Poundstone
B0001HLVS2|5.0|If you are a fan of the Aubrey-Maturin series written by Patrick O'Brian, then this movie will delight you.  A faithful adaptation by Weir, the movie accurately captures the essence of all of O'Brian's books.  O'Brian's masterpiece is more about human relationships, with a sprinkling of action and not the other way around.<br /><br />While some may find the movie \\"slow\\" or \\"boring\\" it is because this is not really a so called war picture.  For those anticipating a high budget action film like Pirates of the Caribbean, it is certainly not at all like that.  Rather, this film focuses on the customs, language, history and culture of the time and involves a clever cat and mouse game between Crowes's Jack Aubrey and a French Frigate Captain.<br /><br />For those who may consider passing up this film because of a lack of action, the film opens with a brief but extremely intense battle scene that shows the horrors of early 19th century naval warfare.  The film also has a dramatic ending and features many intense moments that will leave the viewer eager for more.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing because of the wonderful directing and acting alone.  While a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it was truly a shame this movie did not garner more awards.  On a good TV with a good sound system, the opening battle sequence is hard to beat.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I was pleased that this was exactly what I wanted and it came in great shape!
0393307050|5.0|I went to see Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World mainly because I liked Russell Crowe in his Gladiator role and Napoleonic naval warfare is the subject I find interesting.<br /><br />Be warned, these books are not simple reads or written in a way most would be familiar with. What makes them so great also makes them difficult and can turn a lot of people off of them. O'Brian uses language from the day not only among the characters, but in his narration as well. This creates, I my opinion, absolute immersion because one is forced to always read the language used in that period.<br /><br />Another difficulty is the strongly pervasive use of naval jargon. Many people, myself included, have begun reading the series and turned towards the rear for a glossary of the terms O'Brian uses throughout his books. You can turn and look, but you will not find one. The only clue you will get is a small picture of a ship at the beginning of every book that lists which sails are which. That's it, a small picture as a guide and you are immediately transported to the beginning of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />My advice is that if you like to read, you need to check these books out. You will not understand a lot of what you read for a while but it only gets easier as you go. By comparison, Milton's Paradise Lost or Dante's Inferno are much harder to get accustomed to than this series. Interestingly enough, as time passes you will begin to comprehend almost as a foreign speaker begins to understand a language when surrounded by it for long enough. On my second time through, I am reading it with a fluency achieved by many months of nightly readings in the recent past.<br /><br />More than anything else, these books are about a friendship. The complex and sometimes strained relationship between the two primary characters, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, serve as the foundation upon which all other plot points are laid. Maturin, the small, well educated, scientific and rather unattractive physician is as perfect a foil as I have encountered in literature. His presence amplifies Jack's clear role as the tall, blond, strong and dumb-except-in-naval-matters hero. Although polar opposites in many ways, their one similarity (love of music) binds them together in the unlikeliest of friendships.<br /><br />As I have lengthily stated, this series is driven by the characters and specifically by the two main ones Jack and Stephen. By series end, one almost feels like they are a part of this relationship. You can almost feel the heave of the ship beneath your feet as you sit in Jack's cabin strumming along on the latest Bocherini piece with he and Stephen. It is this intimacy and immersion that makes these books so great. Every turn of events is meaningful because it feels not as if it is befalling a mere character in a novel, but rather, one of your closest friends. Any who are curious should certainly give these books a try. You'll find yourself totally immersed in no time, or black's the white of my eye.perfect a foil as I have encountered in literature.

B000YXMMAE|4.0|I'm gonna be honest, us Radiohead fans are really spoiled. For years we've been showered with great album after great album. Yet, for some reason, at least me personally, I always get this fear that the next Radiohead album will be a disappointment, and this legendary band will finally come back down to earth and actually make just an average record. Fortunately, my feelings have been totally wrong every time, and with this latest release, In Rainbows, I can once again have no worries. The album kinda picks up where Hail to the Thief left off as far as the overall sound goes. Tracks like \\"15 Steps\\", \\"Reckoner\\" \\"Body Snatchers\\" do remind of Hail to the Thief, especially \\"Body Snatchers\\", which makes me think of a heavier version of \\"Go to Sleep\\" for some reason. But don't get me wrong, this one definitely has its own unique feeling and sound to it. I'm just using that album as a reference point. Its just so hard to categorize this band and their sound. Each album is different, but it seems to work every time, no matter what they do. As for In Rainbows, its a brilliant album. Yorke's vocals, Jonny Greenwood's guitars, Selway's drumming, all mesh so well and seemlessly that it feels like you're listening to a soundtrack to a dream, with Nigel Godrich's production being superb as usual. My favorite tracks here are the 2 already mentioned tracks, \\"15 Steps\\" and \\"Bodysnatchers\\", as well as the melodic, yet upbeat \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\",the beautifully crafted \\"House of Cards\\", and piano driven finale \\"Videotape\\". A lot of critics are saying that this album is the best thing they've released since OK Computer back in 1997, and this may be the case. If I did have to say something negative about this album, it would simply be that it is too short. With only 10 tracks and not even 45 minutes in length, I would have liked to seen a couple of more tracks on this one. (But it is nice to see that the price is much cheaper than usual new releases, though) Perhaps an added track or two from the  Discbox release of In Rainbows, which included 8 additional tracks on a second disc. And speaking of which, it would have also been nice to have had a cheaper 2-disc version of that discbox that more people can afford so fans could get those 8 songs. But to be honest,I have really downloaded those tracks (yeah, ilegally...sue me!) but to actually have them on a professionally made CD would be much better. Nonetheless, these issues have nothing to do with the record itself. This album is just like all the other Radiohead records, in the effect that it's utter brilliance. Of course, this album is a must-have for any Radiohead fan, and its a great introduction to the band if you're just getting in to them.two from the  Discbox release of In Rainbows, which included 8 additional tracks on a second disc.

B000RG1NW6|5.0|The fly cover of On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan describes the book as \\"a short novel of remarkable depth by a writer at the height of his powers\\". On Chesil Beach was recently short-listed for the Man Booker Prize, but lost out to Anne Enright's The Gathering. I have read both books and, for me at least, what is so amazing is the mere fact that two such utterly different concepts could have been considered for the same prize. It is reassuringly astounding that the \\"genre\\" of literary fiction can be home to every style, every emotion, every approach, every outcome, everything imaginable and much that is real.<br /><br />Those who write book blurbs are often prone to hyperbole. The greatest, the best, the most, the biggest, the most superlative are terms of mundane commonplace. The term \\"best selling\\" is usually an empty platitude. \\"Real\\" often signifies \\"very\\", but without the latter's imagined meaning. So what can we make of \\"a short novel of remarkable depth by a writer at the height of his powers\\"? In the case of On Chesil Beach this blurb is an understatement, but it is essentially accurate and justified. If I were to write a blurb for this Ian McEwan novel, I would use a single word: masterpiece.<br /><br />I will offer only the merest summary of the plot to provide context, because the book effectively deals with just one event, a newlywed couple's wedding night. What happens to them is the book's crucial point, so to reveal it would render the reading less rewarding. Suffice it to say that Edward and Florence are newlyweds and they are in a Dorset hotel for their honeymoon. This is the early 1960s, an era when sexuality was not discussed or even approached in the manner of even half a decade later.<br /><br />Edward and Florence are products of their age and of their upbringing. Ian McEwan tells us much of these aspects of their characters in asides and cameos throughout the narrative. When I reviewed the same writer's Saturday, I described the book as time turned inside out. In that book, across the span of a single day, an entire family is presented through its past, its aspirations, its identities. On Chesil Beach accomplishes a similar feat across a smaller canvas, but in a much more concentrated form, replete with comment, detail, analysis and observation.<br /><br />Florence is solidly middle class, Edward less so. She is a violinist from a musical family. He likes Chuck Berry. They are deeply in love and they marry, but they remain children of their age, and there is the rationale for the book, an examination of their private ideas on how to cope with adulthood, alongside an account of the practicalities.<br /><br />On Chesil Beach has limited objectives, lives mainly in the events of a single evening, but, like Saturday, turn its time inside out, so we have beautifully detailed pictures of both of the nuptials' families. Coping, or not, is what characterised the age. On Chesil Beach is a masterpiece, beautifully conceived and executed.

It's not exactly four stars as is so I am being nice, but only for the reason that the movie has suffered so much backlash. The assembly cut shown on this version has more character and attitude. There is a great deal of courage and faith, displayed throughout the movie in a somewhat elegant manner, as well are the many vices of humanity given due time in the killing/chase sequences.<br /><br />Alien 3 reminds me a lot of Predator in space, which is not a bad thing when you have the talented David Fincher directing; he would go on to make a couple first rate classics and a couple clunkers as well. I don't get why people act as if this movie is merely trash, when in reality it's certainly better than his Panic Room. I am not saying it is a masterpiece but it's decent for being an abandoned project.<br /><br />The colors and interiors are grimy, slick, and dark, almost eerie in the sense that you feel very isolated as the characters traverse the sewers and broken infrastructure. The prison system is very believable, and though, this movie is different from its prequels, it should be judged on its own merits.<br /><br />Going off the new cut, this movie is a solid entry in the franchise. It leaves one with the impression that all that fuss on theatrical release was about nothing. I can also say that I understand that people didn't want everyone to die. Literally, from this movie and the others, just about everyone goes....<br /><br />While we're on the negative, that crappy computer Alien needs a CGI makeover BADLY, if it wants to catapult the movie into the better action films.... Too many of the shots are shiny and plastic looking PS2 quality and they mar the picture somewhat.<br /><br />But the acting is for the most part spot on, and along with the locations and costumes, is well done, professional, and detailed. The carved alien is generally frightening as ever, and the music evokes fear and dread well.<br /><br />Fincher himself does not like to be associated with this movie, so we can only hope he comes back sometime to make the definitive cut, even if they don't do much to alter things. I really don't see why they can't do a few things to spiff it up. The CGI alien ruins the immersion that high-res models could easily portray. It takes a couple of weeks and would make the film so much more believable. I certainly think Blade Runner was massively improved, and though that film is an absolute masterpiece, there is no reason someone can't put a few dollars behind this movie.<br /><br />In the end, as it is, kind of unfinished or just not polished, I give the film as a whole a 3.5, on note that people realize it was never as bad as some would have you believe.c evokes fear and dread well.<br /><br />Fincher himself does not like to be associated with this movie, so we can only hope he comes back sometime to make the definitive cut, even if they don't do much to alter things.

B00005ASIL|5.0|Jethro Tull was one these bands that one might denominate as heralds of the Rock. Indeed, they established new paths and ways of expression through the wise employment of the flute and a smart support on the basis of the folk tunes of Irish airs.<br /><br />So the final outcome was an accurate blend of power and original musicality that became them as one of ther most innovative bands at the end of the sixties.<br /><br />After them, there were many other bands that inspired by them, intended with minor success to repeat the formula. But as you and me are aware about the historical transcendence of a immortal band that signed with golden letters a well deserved place among the great ones.<br /><br />To my mind the cream of the cream tracks are Teacher, Aqualung, Living in the past, Cross eyed Mary, Thick as a brick, Minstrel in the gallery, Bouree, A new day yesterday, Nothing is easy , The whistler and Heavy horses.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|Taylor Swift's debut album is awesome.  I put it in my CD player a lot.  Impressive stuff from such a young artist, especially considering she wrote much of the album as well.  I hope to see more of her.  An excellent choice for fans of modern female country.  Really good songs:  Picture to Burn, Should Have Said No, Our Song.
0553582038|4.0|I had not read Mr. Martin before this series.  I am amazed at his character development and how he immerses you in his world.  He writes in an unhurried  manner and while the books are lengthy, they don't seem overlong.  I have become attached to the characters, flaws and all.  All in all, it's a great read.  I would recommend Martin to anyone mature enough to appreciate him.
B000148KK2|4.0|Just discovered Diana Krall, but love her voice!  Just like going back in time to the golden days of jazz/blues.  Her CD, \\"The Girl in the Other Room,\\" is just terrific.  We'll be purchasing all her CDs from now on.
0446577391|3.0|David Baldacci is a second tier fiction writer, but at the top of the second tier.  He tells a good story, but lacks a concern for the detail and character development that really draw you in.    I enjoyed this book - I read it on vacation and breezed through it in a couple of days and appreciated it in the same mindless way I appreciate an episode of 24.    In fact, the book reads like a screenplay - fact-paced, lots of action, very predictable, meaningless dialog.    A fun read if you are trying to rest your mind, not grow it.
B000002AH9|1.0|Old and great fans of Billie Holiday, but this sound track is scratchy.....voice sounds bad, as if the singer is attempting to relive the golden years, but the voice is just not up to it.  Did not enjoy listening, and could not even listen to the entire CD it was of such poor quality.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Astounding! This film, based off of the bestselling novel, is highly enjoyable and fun. The director was faced with the heavy challenge of translating smell onto the screen. He uses color and brilliant Tim Burtonesque effects that work very well. The story is also very original and intriguing. Luckily, the ending was not changed for the movie. While many will find the ending weird and unfitting, but I walked away completely satisfied. A+
B000003N8R|5.0|Outstanding!  Better than even anticipated!  If you like John Coltrane, you'll love this CD.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|after reading a few of those reviews it became obvious that most of you are just conservatives who are bringing in ur political beliefs into this film and judging it based on such. I'm guessing that you guys and gals are either ultra sensitive, ultra patriotic or have a hand in using ideals to gain power (of any sort.) The rest of you might be correct- this might be a bad adaptation of the original (I didn't even know this was a novels adaptation.) On the stance that I wasn't aware that this was an adaptation or have any idea how the original version was fashioned I must say that this is of the best films- could count them in one hand that I have ever seen. Those who have been exposed to the novel might want to heed or keep the warning given by those that have seen it in mind. The rest of you should watch it and then decide- thats just my opinion though. Also, keep in mind that this is not an attack on the Bush regime (though in certain aspects it can be applied) if there is something that we in this country can bank on (no matter what tactics are used to discredit the truth or opinions that are seen as menacing- and I'm just speaking in general not regarding any political affiliation) thats our right to free speech.
B000002H6C|5.0|Speed, melody, intensity and meaningful, creative lyrics have always defined metallica, but never before have they created such an angry, pissed off protest that hammered home some serious messages. ...And Justice For All does this with an intense flair that will leave you exhausted from the wicked-intense rhythms and aggressive vocals. It's amazing to see Metallica hammer their instruments for 7 to 9 minutes without letting up for a second, it makes music special. Outstanding effort by the Metal masters from the Bay Area.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Simply stunning. I liked the S. Weaver US edition, but the UK version is really sweet. David Attenborough still is the best.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I'll never understand why people get so stuck on Frank Sinatra when they hear Michael Buble sing an older song. First off, a lot of Sinatra's big hits weren't his originals. I think people that have this problem must have some type of OCD. I'm very glad Buble has given new life to the older songs and for me, has made them his own. The older songs and artists is what inspire Michael Buble. And lets face it, nothing is wrong with that. You can appreciate the music of a bygone era as most of us do, but open your mind to a great entertainer because that is what Michael Buble is. He exceptionally talented and this CD is amazing. The song \\"Always On My Mind\\" is beautiful and for me, it's the best version I've ever heard. Matter of fact, I believe this CD proves he can take any song and make it 100% his. I'm You Man\\" has to be his sexiest song yet. The song \\"Everything\\" was written by Michael, it has a old era vibe to it and is a fantastic love song. If you enjoy a beautiful voice and great songs, this CD is a must buy.
B000LPLTX6|1.0|I don't know where to begin. . .    I hate the actors, especially the main character. I have never seen a character so stupid until now. He's also very annoying.    Who gives a s**t that he's have short term memory loss??
B000YCLRBA|4.0|I saw this in the theater when it was broadcast live and was blown away by the performances of Renee and Dimitri.  The set was minimalist yet wonderful!  I was hoping this would come out on DVD. I just wish it would come out on Blu-Ray disc so I can watch it in Hi-Def at home.  Watching it on standard DVD just doesn't quite compare to watching it in Hi-Def.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Played this game for the first time over Christmas break with family and really enjoyed it. The game is different every time and everyone has a great chance every time. In a world where WII's and PS3's are the new \\"thing\\" it's nice to play a gmae that is enjoyable for the whole family and makes you strategize around the dinner table instead of in front of a TV. Hours of fun!
1401308201|5.0|This book does a spectacular job of explaining \\"the road to Wicked.\\" It had every little detail you ever wanted to know! Apart from it's attractive and loyal cover, the book is filled with testimonials from many of the people involved in getting the musical to where it is today, as well as several of our favorite cast members! This book is definitely a fantastic buy for any Wicked or Broadway fanatic!
0440238609|5.0|It's been awhile since I've been captured by an author's writings. I will be honest ~~ if it weren't for the movie and the fervor that accompanied the movie, I would not have been bothered to pick up these books. My husband and I took advantage of a rare evening out and saw \\"The Golden Compass\\" at the movie theater. It was done well enough that I just knew that the book would be better. So for Christmas, my husband presented these books to me. I read them all in a week and just finished the last three chapters this morning before getting the kids up for school.     This is an incredible series. I personally don't care what the author believes because he's free to believe in what he believes in; last I checked, he is free to write whatever. As long as the stories are compelling, I am happy. If he opens my mind up to new thoughts, then he has done his job as a good writer. The writing itself is wonderful even if it is dark, especially the last book in the series, \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\" Since I am very much aware of the dissatisfication of the Christian right regarding this series (believe me, I've been personally attacked by three people that are very much against this book), I kept reading it to see what was so offensive about it. Not a whole lot. I definitely did not feel like I was being preached against by the author against the totalitarian church or the Christian beliefs. The stories flowed so naturally and wonderfully, yes, I did see where he mentioned that the Christian church is like the big brother and is a mistake; but  he described the church in his books the way history has proven it to be. But like I've mentioned in other reviews, I am confident enough in my personal beliefs not to be threatened by a writer's point of views.     I enjoyed this very much,there were a lot of different themes tied into it, such as alternating worlds, different types of people, good vs. evil (which is always my favorite theme), love and sacrifice, personal redemption, globalwarming, end times and so on. It was fantasy tied in with the supernatural. The story line, of Lyra and her daemon, Pan, flowed naturally and wonderfully. I could see everything that was happening to her in my own mind. However, I will say this, if my boys were to want to read these books, I would strongly recommend them starting it after the age of 11. It is not a series that you can just give to your kids and expect them not to have any questions. It will challenge their way of thinking and open their minds to different ideas, (which, in my opinion, is the whole reason for reading!) and this series is perfect for those times of discussion. The last book itself is very dark and more complex than the first two books. And yes, I was reminded throughout the entire book of C.S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" as well as Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Ring\\" series. However, the one author I kept thinking of the most while reading this series is Madeline L'Engle's \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" series. I love that author and her ideas, and was constantly reminded of them while reading this series.     Now that I've read it and plan to give it to my dad next to read ~~ I will be scrounging around for something else to read that will capture my attention like this series did. That will be a challenge in itself, that's for sure.    1-3-08
6302212529|5.0|The only thing that I don't like about these Disney DVDs is that they're all SO expensive!!!<br /><br />Some new DVDs are [...], but the Disney ones are always [...] +. I don't understand it. Can't a kid buy a Disney DVD for 15 or so bucks anymore? Guess that answer is NO.<br /><br />Disney's \\"The Little Mermaid\\" mostly takes place in the sea.<br /><br />Ariel, who is 16, is very stubborn and headstrong, and disobeys her Father, King Triton at every opportunity.<br /><br />She's lovely though; smart, curious and representing for the pretty, red-heads. :P<br /><br />She meets the dashingly handsome prince, Eric, and falls head over heels. She even makes a \\"fatal\\" deal to give up her sweet, uplifting and downright beautiful voice to the treacherous Witch of the Seas, Ursula. But that in turn, gives her a chance to love a human...But was it worth it?<br /><br />Once she gets legs the story seems to lag (just a bit) but one of the highlights was how excited she was to see Eric's world she's been dreaming of for a while. She gets to command a horse and carriage, gets the wear a dress for the first time and embarrasses herself many times. For some, this part will be a true highlight.<br /><br />The movie is more or less enjoyable from start to finish.<br /><br />I'd recommend any kid to watch this unless they have a short attention span.<br /><br />Not as good as The Lion King or Shrek, but better than Pocahontas, Toy Story and Ice Age.<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />End note: Part Of Your World is a breath-taking experience and alone boosts the score considerably. Very moving and emotional.
0743298039|5.0|In addition to being very well written this novel is filled with twists and unexpected turns that are at times quite subtle. It is well worth the time it takes to read it.
B00005NGAK|2.0|Bought this for my dad for Christmas since he loved Riverdance, Lord of the Dance. I was disappointed, it was very much like Lord of the Dance and the spirit of the Irish dance that was there for Riverdance was not there for me. Very showy. Michael Flatley had to have it be the biggest outdoor event EVER and in Hyde Park no less. So for me the focus seemed to be on how outrageously huge it could be with the set and the number of dancers. Most of the numbers we had seen before, some new ones added including the finale by Michael which frankly didn't wow me. Overall, felt like I had already seen it. Also did not appreciate the sexuality that has been added. The talented dancers carry the show, not the sex.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD.  Makes me want to go out and beat down someone.  :)
B000E6UWE4|2.0|I didn't enjoy Gardens of the Moon half as much as any George R.R. Martin or Robert Jordan book.  Here are the problems I found with it.    1.  Needs a prequel.  It's easy to get lost and have no idea what is going on since no background is given on the many names, races, places thrown at you.      2.  Poorly described topography.  I felt like everything was taking place in a barren desert wasteland.  I struggled to grasp what kind of world this was.      3.  No reason to care for the characters.  It was like watching a football game with two teams you know nothing about playing against each other and each having a role to play, but that's it. There was very little personality.  Where Martin excels, Erikson fails completely.  I couldn't have cared less who lived and who died.  Most were expendable in my opinion.  Only Kruppe stood out as an interesting character with any kind of personality.  The rest were as flat as the pages they were written on.  You rarely get into the characters heads.  It's mainly following them from point A to point B with very little emotion.  Tasks are completed and then it's time for the next one.  Also characters could be described in more detail.  I had a hard time keeping them straight and imagining what they even looked like.  Erikson is the anti-Jordan here.    4.A little too much magic.  Sometimes less is more as in the case with Martin's series.  Martin knows how to make magic count.  Magic is so powerful and so frequently used, it becomes too commonplace here.      I am over 350 pages into of Deadhouse Gates and it still doesn't get any better.  Once again Erikson gets an F in character development.  When you don't know much or care about any of the characters, nothing really matters much.    I just hope Laseen will kill everyone so maybe Erikson could start fresh with some interesting characters.
B000000H57|5.0|This album is hauntingly beautiful.  Few are the albums such as this that can bring me to tears.<br /><br />Fantasic!
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Finally, something to really sink my teeth or ears into as well as mind! I've only previously owned the 1982 faux soundtrack.It is the BR orchestrated and jazzed up version which could stand on it's own merit as a pretty good album for background evening-dinner music. Yet,it falls way short in length and in capturing the futuristic electronic sounds that Vangelis originally created.If it captured any semblance to the film, it did it in a very,very different way that us fans were luke warm about but accepted because it was the only release at the time.Seven years later,some of us Blade Runner Original Soundtrack seekers were even mercilessly teased with three tracks that officially appeared for the first time on Vangelis' 1989 Themes compilation(actually, the song Memories Of Green came from his 1980 album \\"See You Later\\")!Then,I purchased the 1994 version when it was first released (twelve years after the film's initial release).I was blown away with it.Loved it---still do.Sure, I realized that there were some \\"vital\\" musical passages or score cues missing and what so many,such as myself, wanted from the movie and bootlegs to be included ,on that release, were not.However, I was satisfied with what Vangelis did release and even welcomed and highly enjoyed the tracks not in the film such as Wait For Me, Rachel's Song, Blush Response and Damask Rose. Over the years, I've  listened to a multitude of sci-fi film soundtracks that have tried to imitate Blade Runner, such as The Fifth Element(and I am a fan of French music composer Eric Serra). Numerous other soundtracks as well have tried to duplicate that Vangelis magic.Yet, I always come back to the soundtrack of Blade Runner. Vangelis is unique and a one of a kind musical artist;There is no other like him!     I can say that Disc 2 I have listened to with the lights low,and with my eyes closed most of the time in a quiet room;The mental imagery,the nostalgic feeling, the overall mood that Vangelis created with this second disc is pure genius.In sum, it is amazing material.One word, and it may be a bit overused and a bit cliched, but is the one that fits is melancholy.Tracks like One Alone, Desolation Path, Empty Streets,and the \\"re-mixing\\" or insertion of wind effects for Fading Away really seal this disc's somber and rich ambient mood,yet,also maintains a very desolate and introspective feel(the music makes one think and conjure mental visuals--either of the film itself or whatever comes to the mind of the listener---it's cerebral music).The other tracks on disc 2 have a sort of menacing tension(At Mr. Chew's,Deckard and Roy's Duel,Leon's Room).Either way,the second disc makes one think!Some have complained about the bleeps and bloops and \\"gimmicky\\" sound effects added;They are anything but gimmicky and do serve purpose in enhancing the music without coming across as stereotypical sci-fi tacky sound effects shlock.    Disc 3 \\"BR25\\" was just an excuse for Vangelis Papathanassiou(say that five times real fast) to release a wonderful new album without selling or offering two different packages at the same time to buyers.Disc 3 is the \\"hopeful\\" and \\"slightly uplifting\\" part of the Blade Runner realm that somewhat contrasts with the dark and brooding,moody,stark and somber feel of the rest of the film's soundtrack(there's a bit of useage of the sax).Anyone who has ever heard or owns Vangelis' 1990 release The City or 1988's Direct will see where he is coming from by infusing spoken word and a sort of jazzy swaggering feel to some tracks on BR25. This disc really has a noirish nature or vibe with a slight/faint/hint of pop-techno lilt or twist(but not enough to shove this disc into mediocrity or sell out status)! Some may find the spoken words to be distracting.For me, they only add or enhance.Overall,with Disc 3, whether one is tranpsorted into the future of BR or any future or anywhere else, one thing is for sure;You will be transported to an imaginative and visual destination. I agree with another reviewer who said that Disc 3 takes the listener to what may be another part of the Blade Runner Los Angeles area that we did not get to see on film;Another part of the 'hood---away from Deckard,Rachel,Roy,Pris and Dr. Tyrell.It's the \\"meanwhile -in -another- location- of- Los Angeles 2019\\" extension to the BR world;It could even be another city entirely such as San Francisco(as in the actual novel by Phillip K. Dick),who knows.It could even be events that happened after the film ends and another Blade Runner detective has his own adventures.I digress.    NO tantrums thrown here towards Vangelis for not releasing what so many, myself included, thought was going to be the absolute and definitive holy grail of the Blade Runner soundtrack(the one that would have finally put all those bootlegs to shame---however, I really don't want to hear the John Williams film company logo/movie trademark tune at the very beginning that some of the bootlegs have---jeesh).As I write this, another thought came across my mind---a sort of semi-comical one, though to the die hard fans, it is anything but;What if Vangelis said to himself,\\"Alright, so there are bootlegs that have been circulating all these years---I'll really show them. Now I'm  NEVER gonna release the entire score! That'll teach 'em!\\"Basically, makes me wonder if Vangelis thought or said, \\"Eh,s---w 'em!...\\"-------I'm counting the blessings (other unreleased material,bonus tracks,new album) and not the omissions with this 25th Anniversary Edition of Blade Runner.    I can only reiterate what other reviewers have mentioned or noted;If you are a Vangelis fan or music collector of his works,ESPECIALLY his soundtrack releases, then you know how he releases,edits, and even re-mixes his material(I have a couple of his soundtracks where the same song has been altered or remixed for the album release from the film version). He's never been one to succumb to the masses or what the public wants.Is that a selfish artist or artistic genius? You decide. This sheer musical artistry comes from a man that neither reads nor writes music!There are a number of soundtracks over the years that he has not released \\"officially\\" ;The Bounty, Missing, and Bitter Moon come to mind.     By the way,do I wish that Vangelis had given us \\"Deckard Meets Rachel\\", the stark and minimalist haunting drum and keyboard intro at the begininng of the opening credits cues or the uber extended versions of Blade Runner Blues,End Titles,Wounded Animals,Dangerous Days? You bet. Am I steamed or feel cheated. No way. I have heard on YouTube the missing cues(Deckard Meets Rachel,Opening Credits, etc.) and original extended versions ( Blade Runner Blues , End Titles,Wounded Animals/Dangerous Days)  that are not on the official release and do understand how remarkable those tracks  are.However, now owning this 25th Anniversary Blade Runner Edition,I am glad I did not pass this up based on certain score cues missing or two minutes missing from this track or five from that track!    Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary is absolutely worthy of the five golden stars (I only wonder how long the digipack cd case will hold up since this release will receive a lot of listening sessions from me)...
1881273156|5.0|My husband, who is a minister requires all couples in pre-marital counseling to read this book.  Saves a lot of marriage counseling later.  This book not only works for married couples, but for any 2 or more people in a relationship.  Parents/children, student/teacher, friend/friend, etc.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|I am sorry for the Blade Runner fans who were expecting a complete score.  I myself was hopeful when the press release announced the \\"complete music from the film\\" would finally be available.  Still, this is Vangelis we're talking about, and as others have said, he never releases a complete score.  So I wasn't surprised in the end.    This is a fantastic box set and I'll tell you why--it is the only legal, high-quality box set of any Vangelis music ever to be released.  I am a Vangelis fan first and BR fan second, which I think is what divides the critical and positive reviews here.  It does seem redundant to include CD 1 in this set since all of us who care already have it, but the other two CDs are wonderful.  CD 2 includes the full cues to music which were only heard in small bits during the film.  This music takes fans back to an earlier era of Vangelis music, an era in which many of us first discovered him.  CD 3, though new, is also nostalgic in one sense, but fresh in others.  There's something in his blending of synthesized and acoustic sounds that has never been replicated elsewhere.  Most composers are limited to the instruments of an orchestra to create sound for their themes and images.  Vangelis can find a sound in anything and for anything.  Anyone can find something to like in his music, though some of it I'll admit requires an acquired taste.    This set along with any Vangelis album is worth purchasing.  Fans of music in general will be pleased to discover a new kind of music.  This isn't New Age; it's hard to categorize.  It's familiar in some ways without holding to convention, and exotic in other ways.    Also highly recommended:  1492: Conquest of Paradise, Antarctica, and Chariots of Fire.
0143038583|3.0|Michael Pollan's book is actually little about the dilemma of being an omnivor and in fact I ignored this book for some time because without prior knowledge of the contents I assumed it would be focused on what the title states: an analysis of the various trade-offs and advantages inherent to any animal that is omnivorous.  But in fact Pollan's book is actually about the problems that arise from the industrialization of food production, which is a totally different topic and a rather more interesting one.<br /><br />Pollan uses the by-now standard approach of \\"first-person folksy\\" journalistic writing that is sadly the typical lazy style of the vast majority of American writers today.  It includes accounts of his sojourn down on Polyface Farm, his various treks across America to witness for himself the growing, harvesting, and use of industrial corn, trips to fast-fod joints, and so forth.  It's all rather predictable but despite the tedium of the approach Pollen makes many important points, the main being that the way we grow and consume calories in the USA is essentially insane.  All the exogenous costs of the inputs (namely fertilizer, water, petroleum, anti-biotics, pesticides) are born outside of the price of the food as actually delivered to the consumer.  So while that corn-fed slab of over-fatty hormone-addled beef may appear to cost only $9.99 per pound in the supermarket, its actual cost - as born by the taxpayer indirectly through a plethora of government subsidies - is perhaps two or three times that amount.  And the quality of the resulting food is abysmal and its health impact is atrocious.  In other words, American food is literally disgusting.<br /><br />Some reviewers have suggested that any book that proposes people should pay a little more in order to secure higher-quality (and healthier) food is essentially elitist, but that's a foolish argument because it likewise overlooks the total cost of production.  The fact is that Americans are taxed far too heavily by the government so that the government can prop up insane policies with huge quantities of cash.  If more rational (and healthy) farm policies were adopted the total cost of food would fall even as the nominal price appeared to rise.  In other words, instead of paying $350 in tax per every $1,000 earned and then buying disgusting beef for $9.99 per pound, the average American should be paying $150 in tax for every $1,000 earned and thereby be able to afford beef at $29.99 per pound.  But as this can't be achieved overnight (or, indeed, over the course of several decades, because once a stupid idea gets started it takes an inordinate amount of time and effort to undo) it's down to the individual consumer.  And what is elitist about proposing that we care about the food we consume?  Surely a cell phone or an iPod or a TV is not more important than what we eat?<br /><br />Pollan makes some very useful points about soil quality and the terrible over-use of artificial fertilizers (and the resulting soil depletion that results).  He makes useful points about the superior flavor of real food in constrast to the cardboard food found in supermarkets.  But by the end of the book the intelligent reader will be left hoping that a more adequate writer will tackle the subject, because many of the important conclusions that should have been drawn are left unstated.<br /><br />The most fundamental flaw in the book is the fact that it is really two halves in search of a whole.  One half is all to do with the madness of industrialized food production, while the second half lurches unpreparedly into a kind of philosophy-of-eating-101 in which Pollan tries to cover various of the topics associated with the omnivorous condition.  He correctly rebuts what might be termed the \\"Disneyland room-service mentality\\" of animal rights activists who know appallingly little about the reality of animal existence but the entire thing is a kind of paper argument: neither the strongest anti-meat arguments nor the strongest rebuttals are presented.  We meander through a half-hearted discussion rather than really get to grips with fundamental issues.<br /><br />Worse, Pollen's championing of the \\"food shed\\" concept reveals that he's an economic illiterate.  For thousands of years humans have been moving things around the world in order to ensure everyone involved is better off (although he's misunderstood and unfashionable, Ricardo was right nevertheless) and food is no different in this regard from copper or oil.  What matters is to capture all costs, not make arbitrary distinctions.  Pollen seems to feel it is wrong for people to eat certain foodstuffs that have to be transported over distance.  But he totally fails to follow where his argument would lead: that people any distance from the ocean would never have fish, or even salt; that people worldwide would have to give up sugar and pepper; that, in fact, 99% of what we eat these days would vanish from our parochial menues.  This aspect of Pollen's book is the least satisfying because it reveals him at his laziest: a middle-class, well-fed complacent journalist content to meander along his course without undertaking the necessary intellectual preparation required to equip him to undertake his work more adequately.<br /><br />Pollen's \\"first-person folksy\\" style is equally utterly inadequate to pull the various strands to their logical conclusion - but perhaps a more erudite and thoughtful book would not have succeeded in achieving a place on the NYT best-seller list.  After all, the quality of American writing is much of a piece with the quality of American food - but that's an irony Pollen naturally does not choose to explore.strongest rebuttals are presented.

0143038419|1.0|I do not know what book everyone who is praising it is reading.  Her ego wrote 80% of the book as I find the autobiography to be VERY wordy about her own emotions & lacks depth not to mention information on her lessons from mentors.  If you are looking to read about an emotionally immature person in her later thirties, this book is for you.  I have seen better insight from  persons in their teens & twenties.

B000YENUI6|4.0|I went to watch Promises at the London Film Festival in October - it opened the festival. As many have said before, Mortensen is at his best - I don't think I'm stretching out my neck too far by saying his best so far.    I found it a gripping story - beginning to end, though the pre-ending (kiss scene) was IMHO absolutely unnecessary and there are some scenes in there that were too long.    A lot was said about the steamroom fight - yes it was frightening and gripping and certainly proving a point - but my question is, why are so many (journalists, fans) focussing on that scene? - it's not Mortensen's first (full frontal nudity - The Indian Runner) and apart from that, I personally found the brothel scene (Semyon's favourite stable) more intriguing and revealing much more about Nikolai... but maybe that's just me.    All in, certainly a movie I'm going to watch again and catch more of the subtleties in it. Apart from Watts, whom I didn't find very convincing (but maybe it was the role itself)- the cast is great and next to Mortensen, Mueller-Stahl and Cassel did a fab job portraying the characters.

0525950079|3.0|Historical novels about the Middle Ages will appeal to many demur and conservative readers. The bad news is that World Without End will dismay, even horrify most such readers. First, this is a novel in which soldiers, brigands, and royal intrigue are not important, but which nevertheless contains a surprising number of altercations ending in gruesome murder, some perpetrated by women. The people killed often deserve to die, but still, graphic descriptions of violent deaths are not something I prefer to dwell on.    A convenient quick description of the second shocking aspect is \\"gratuitous sex.\\" Now Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (written a few decades after the time in which WWE takes place) makes plain that our medieval ancestors could be downright lewd (the Wife of Bath gives Erica Jong a good run for her money). And to honour the vow of chastity in the breach was not rare in those days. But gratuitous is not the adjective that WWE brings to mind, but rather \\"relentlessly graphic in a masculine way.\\" Time and again, characters are lifting skirts and dropping drawers. 3-4 such episodes in a novel this long can be humoured but no, Follett sees fit to mention the genitalia of his characters dozens of times, including homosexual encounters (despite their being punishable at that time by death, a fact which Follett rightly mentions).    Even though this is a very long novel, the writing is brisk and economical. There is a lot of dialogue, but its crispness and directness feels anachronistic; some characters feel like contemporary people in medieval dress. Other historical novelists often employ quaint and courtly language to distance their characters from the present day, usually to good effect.    Follett has done his homework on the economic history of the high middle ages, the oppression of serfdom, the conflicts between the aristocracy and the emerging middle class, the dawn of civil and mechanical engineering, the difficulty in grasping the most elementary medical concepts (women, using common sense and everyday experience, were more likely to be closer to our truth than male doctors with university training), and the impact of the Black Death (by far the worst disaster ever to strike the European world).    The time of the novel is when the English people began manifesting the abilities in business and technology that eventually flourished into the global civilisation we see around us. We know how it all ends: democracy, equality before the law, due process, less violence in day to day life, a vast rise in technology, economic freedom, and the standard of living, a splendid scientific medicine, a smashing of the monopoly that was the medieval church, and daily showers and flush toilets for all. It was always good to be reminded of how medieval Europe was the crucible in which this happy ending emerged.

B0002KQNL8|5.0|This movie will always hold a special place in my heart as being the first zombie movie I ever saw. I used to be really scared of this (I was five or six at the time) but now I just find it to be a cheesy slice of 80's zombie goodness. Some of the cast from the first film returns (along with the girl from the cult classic Killer Klowns) in a story similiar to the first but (in my opinion) better and more enjoyable. I liked the zombie FX and the over-the-top gore funny scenes. The dialogue was cheesy as hell but I assumed that was the point.

When I ordered it Amazon first told me it was out but then a day later said it was on its way.     I have only had the book long enough to read the introduction and look at a few of the chapters. The book and the pictures are beautiful in their simplicity.     I am elated by the potential that I see by implementing these ideas in my own presentations yet depressed by the comparison I see in my slides versus Garrs.    In high school I along with many others were petrified to get up in front of a class to give a speech. If the tools that are presented in this book were available then I would have welcomed the opportunity to share information.    This book is not just theory but a \\"how to\\" or as the title says \\"Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery.\\"    Thanks Garr for sharing your passion.

0143038583|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, to the point that I purchased five additional copies to give to my friends.  This is a well-written book on the industrial food chain that dominates the American food supply, and the less dominate methods of organic, \\"beyond organic\\" and \\"hunter-gatherer\\".    Where does your meal come from?  Pollan's subtitle, \\"A natural history of four meals\\" suggests a drier topic than what is actually presented.  This is a well-written book that is appears to be well-researched and also something of a personal journey for Pollan.  He gets involved in his story.  As part of his research into the industrial food chain, Pollan buys a steer from a cattle rancher and follows the steer into the feedlot.  Researching alternatives to the modern organic farm, Pollan spends a week working at Polyface farms, gaining an intimate perspective on management intensive farming.  For his final meal, Pollan goes hunting for wild pig in the foothills of northern California and goes diving for abalone off the northern California coast.  Each section of the book ends in a meal -- the final result of the food chain.  A meal from McDonald's (industrial), an organic meal, a meal based on food from Polyface and finally a meal he acquired \\"from the wild,\\" hunted, gathered and cooked by Pollan himself.    I was intensely interested in all aspects of this book, but especially the discussion about the industrial food chain, remarkably all based on corn.  It was my first book of its type that I've read.  Other books that have been recommended to me include Fast Food Nation and Harvest for Hope (Jane Goodall).

B000YXMMAE|5.0|For many fans, waiting for a new Radiohead album is like being a seven year old on Christmas Eve, with the anticipation stretched across nearly five years. For the most obsessive fans, this interim period marks a distinct chapter in life, making the stakes high and leaving a lot of room for disappointment. Fortunately, Radiohead's In Rainbows does not disappoint.    Rainbows starts off with a bang, as Radiohead albums do. \\"15 Step\\" is Radiohead at their most joyful, its combination of tribal beats and Jonny Greenwood's subtle but melodious guitar line make this track infectious. Next comes \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" a relentless interplay of scathing guitars growl while Thom Yorke's urgent, paranoid vocals struggle to assert that \\"he's alive,\\" that he's \\"seen them coming.\\" This song will literally push you backwards    After \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" the mood of the album changes dramatically in the direction of masterfully crafted and intimate beauty that is simultaneously sparse and lush. Yorke's delicate vocals on \\"Nude\\" and \\"Arpeggi's\\" slow-burning drive will trigger your endorphins and send shivers down your spine. The crescendo of \\"All I Need\\" is exceptionally strong, even for Radiohead who has made a living off of unconventional rising song structures.    There are two wholly new songs on Rainbows and both tracks stand out. \\"Faust Arp\\" is a mesmerizing two minutes reminiscent of Elliott Smith or the Beatle's \\"Julia.\\" \\"Reckoner\\" contains some of Yorke's best falsetto, beautiful orchestration, and a hypnotic guitar line. It is a fan favorite and one of the Radiohead's most impressive moments.     The weakest track on Rainbows is \\"House of Cards,\\" a reggae influenced pop song which drones on for too long and drenches Yorke's otherwise pristine vocals in heaps of reverb. But where \\"House of Cards\\" falters, \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" triumphs. This rock song, though tamer than \\"Bodysnatchers,\\" rounds out the album nicely. At the climax, Yorke's voice and his intriguing lyrics switch from collected to clamorous, leading into the haunting funeral dirge that is \\"Videotape.\\"    \\"Videotape,\\" though different from the lauded live version, perfectly encapsulates the mood of the entire album, best likened to reconnecting with an old friend, or recalling a lost loved one. The experience doesn't always line up with your expectations, but it is warm and pleasant with a tinge of sadness. Rainbows represents Radiohead's strongest collection of songs since OK Computer, and their most cohesive album since Kid A.

B0001XAPZ6|2.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (Hayao Miyazaki, 1984)<br /><br />Now I have to say that I'm a big, big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's stuff, usually. But every once in a while he does something that I just can't wrap my head around. Everyone but me is insanely fond of Princess Mononoke. I saw it once, and have had no desire to see it again, even when I've seen Kiki's Delivery Service more times than I can count, and Spirited Away probably a dozen times more than that. Then there is Nausicaa.<br /><br />What should have been a great story is turned into a political polemic. Nausicaa (voiced, in the American version, by White Oleander's Alison Lohman) is a princess in a post-apocalyptic world, living in the Valley of the Wind, one of the last remaining outposts of humans in a world ruled by the Ohmu, huge insects who protect the Toxic Forest from human encroachment. Nausicaa wants to find some way to bring the humans and the ohmu harmony, but another faction of humans, the warlike Tolmekians, want to revive the Flame Giants to destroy the ohmu and allow humanity to rule the planet again. Along the way, we're treated to knee-jerk environmentalism, pacifism, and various other isms that are quite popular until people actually start thinking about them.<br /><br />While, technically, it's just as fine as any other Miyazaki film, its syrupy sweetness and staunch refusal to treat the subjects it addresses with any depth whatsoever are hard to choke down, like cake that's little sponge and much frosting. The token \\"victory pulled from the jaws of defeat\\" ending is just the poisonous berry that tops it all off. For Miyazaki completists only. * ½
B00005JNJV|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but it may be a touch overrated. Adequate if not good performances by all members of the cast, especially Christian Bale, who comes across as interesting, charismatic, and likeable.  The imagery may have been a bit run of the mill compared to a Tim Burton rendering.  Nonetheless, the Batman franchise seems to still be alive and well with this latest edition.

B00005V9HA|4.0|Re-Animator (Stuart Gordon, 1985)<br /><br />While Re-Animator is probably best remembered now for starting the mini industry of Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna films based on H. P. Lovecraft works, whose quality has been steadily in decline ever since, that shouldn't diminish your enjoyment for this first, and strongest, example of the subgenre. This is both Stuart Gordon and Jeffrey Combs at their respective bests.<br /><br />Herbert West (Combs), after some trouble in Switzerland, has been relocated to Miskatonic University to continue perfecting a serum which will reanimate the dead. He immediately clashes with his anatomy professor, Carl Hill (David Gale). Meanwhile, he's taken a room in the house of the University's star med student, Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott), which adds another complication: Hill is obsessed with Meg Halsey (Barbara Crampton), Cain's fiancee and the daughter of the Dean of the Medical School (Robert Sampson). Cain finds himself drawn in through guilt-by-association to Hill's attempts to persecute West-- though it doesn't in any way help that West is more than slightly off his rocker, and worse, very close to perfecting his serum.<br /><br />While these days it may seem rather tame (though one notorious scene still stands out as a testament to the need to shower we all felt after watching the movie twenty-odd years ago), when it was first released, Re-Animator's blend of humor and gore was, if not unique, one of the finest treatments that particular subgenre had ever received. Gordon's budget was far higher than any Herschel Gordon Lewis had ever worked with, and the movie looks a great deal better as a result; the other great horror-comedy hit of that year, Return of the Living Dead, was far more interested in making the viewer laugh than grossing the viewer out. Gordon wanted to do both in spades, and he succeeded. Re-Animator is sick and twisted and funny and disgusting and all the wonderful things a gore comedy should be. That it no longer pushes the envelope is irrelevant; it's still a damned fun movie. ****levant; it's still a damned fun movie. ****
B000VWYJ8Q|4.0|What a movie Bourne Ultimatum turned out to be. Sometimes the third movie can be a hit or a miss, or you feel it's being dragged out too long. Apart from very slightly starting to drag towards the end, I felt Ultimatum was a brilliant, quite possible finish to the Bourne movies.<br /><br />Apart from being visually stunning, I felt this was the movie where things were finally wrapped up, all the loose ends, all the things viewers had been puzzling over. I particularly the small and annoying revelation that Bourne & Nicky knew each other before his amnesia. Nicky's character, played by Julia Stiles, has always been a major quibble of mine in the previous movies, as she wasn't around enough, and you know they wanted to do something with her character. With a lot more screen time - even if they were determined to make her look like Franka Potente's character, and even give her a similar storyline - Julia Stiles might finally make it big in the adult movies.<br /><br />The only other major problem with this movie I had was the camera angles used. It takes a lot for a camera angle to irritate the hell out of me. But there a few times in this that you're seeing a conversation from two people, and the camera stays behind actor one for example, with their back taking up most of the screen and just seeing the other actor's head over first actor's shoulder. Not a good shot, and I'm sure there's a technical term for it, but I don't know what it is.<br /><br />Once again, there's some stunning car/motorbike action, and also a towel comes in extremely useful during a pretty intense fight. Also an amazing scene in Waterloo station, which made me feel like I was looking at a Where's Wally picture. Won't ruin it for you, but it's certainly shocking.<br /><br />I have a feeling there's going to be another Bourne movie - what next after Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum? I hope they leave it alone, as it tied everything up quite nicely. I would like to know more about Nicky & Bourne's relationship, but it seemed quite appropriate the way they did it.uite appropriate the way they did it.

B000HA4WTS|5.0|Why are people being so ignorant towards the 3 fast and furious movies?  I can understand your hate for street racing or even bad acting, but you cant hate the fact that all three of them broke records in the box office, and DVD sales are no joke either.  Majority of people like these movies.  Yes, number one had car related comments and descriptions that made absolutely no sense to a gear head like myself, and of course number 2 had stunts, that not even EVIL himself would attempt but the third one (tokyo drift) is as realistic as you can get.  Stunts were ALL performed.     I catch myself watching these movies majority of the times not for the story line, or plot or even the acting, but for the  cinematic features involving the unique cars pretty girls and stunts that i \\"dont perform\\" but envy.        So, if you want to waste a written review, go do so on the regular DVD.  When i read reviews for movies in the HD format and the BLU RAY format, I am solely looking for     1: Audio reviews (1 through 5 stars with reason)    2: Video reviews (1 through 5 stars with reason)   3: Extra feature (1 through 5 stars with reason)     and finally i would like to see an overall opinion and if it is worth purchasing for BLU RAY OR HD or just keep my original DVD . . .

B000TGCR38|4.0|Well, this film certainly got my interest since this is the same director who made \\"Basic Instinct\\".  So, Paul Verhoeven has returned to his roots after his good streaks in Hollywood.  You probably have seen his Hollywood hits like \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Basic Instinct\\", \\"Starship Troopers\\", \\"Robocop\\", etc.  Don't get me wrong that I am a snob to pop culture since I am equally guilty for following it, too.  But, it did strike me odd that Verhoeven decided to go back to his roots with this Dutch war drama epic.  After watching the DVD special features, you realize that Verhoeven has a eye for detail.  The interviews with the cast are interesting, but the making of the film is particularly worth watching.  The entire cast is wonderful and the storyline never slows down.  Also, it's refreshing to see a new face of Carice van Houten who Paul Verhoeven decided to cast in this film.  Well, I hope that Verhoeven continues in this same vein with this film.

B000OCY7JE|4.0|Hopefully, you have not read the above editorial review from Amazon.com.  Frankly, the Amazon.com editorial review gives away too much from the film which is part of the pleasure in discovering the plot as it unravels.  Anyways, this Danish film was nominated for Best Foreign Picture in 2006 but lost to an equally well-done German film, \\"The Lives of Others\\".  However, I feel that this film deserves credit with its writing/direction and wonderful acting cast.  It is a surprise to see Mads Mikkelsen who you probably recognized from the latest James Bond 007 Film, \\"Casino Royale\\".  He actually shines quite nicely in this role.<br /><br />It's difficult to describe the plot without giving too much away.  But, I must say that there is a lot of care in slowly revealing the relationship between the main character, Jacob, and the other characters in the wedding.  The film presents the happiness, despair, dreams, acheivements, failures, etc. in life which is pretty much like everyone's life in general.  We are faced with tough decisions in life and deal with it just like these characters.  In the end, we just appreciate what we have and continue living.  That's the real charm of this movie which I think that everyone can appreciate from this film.  No one is immune to life's obstacles but we learn to deal with it one day at a time.
B000957O82|4.0|Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens (Will Smith) is the \\"date doctor\\" who helps men get to first base with the woman of their dreams. He isn't a sleaze who teaches them to lie and con their way forward, he helps build their confidence and form a plan so they don't look like fools. His latest challenge is Albert (Kevin James), a portly tax accountant who lusts after a glamorous heiress. While Hitch is coaching Albert in the toughest assignment of his career, he also pursues a reporter for a New York tabloid. As one might expect in a romantic comedy, misunderstandings ensue and both Hitch and Albert will have to struggle if they want to capture true love.<br /><br />Will Smith is one of the most likeable personas around and he exudes his usual easy charm here. The ethics of his profession had the potential to get dicey, but it's made very clear that he doesn't help guys score, he helps men looking for love. Just as most shrinks seem to be emotionally damaged, so too the love doctor is suffering the long-term effects of a broken heart. Hitch is charming and witty with a woman but letting her inside is a bit too scary. Albert is the opposite, of course. A big teddy bear who would declare his love for the heiress before she knew his name (with disastrous results) if he didn't have Hitch to advise him. The training sessions with the two of them are probably the most enjoyable of the whole movie and certainly enjoyable.<br /><br />If there was a downside to the movie, it was the character of Sara, Hitch's love interest. She is so judgmental and shrill that I found myself wishing that Hitch would find someone a lot more pleasant to pursue. Alas, the poor man was smitten and so can look forward to continued verbal maulings for quite some time.<br /><br />This is an easy movie to watch and an easy movie to like. Hitch is funny, entertaining, and has a good-hearted feel. Will Smith is as good as expected, but Kevin James plays a critical role in providing warmth and vulnerability in a movie that could otherwise have come off as slick and cynical.have come off as slick and cynical.

B000Y7U98C|5.0|This movie is nothing short of brilliant!  It is painfully beautiful to follow this movie to its bittersweet climax.  The film is very well acted and sports deeply moving characters who grow a little, devolve a little and feel almost as real as the pseudo-science the plot so cleanly takes for granted.  I can tell this movie won't appeal to a wide audience, but like 2001 and Blade Runner, I do believe its audience and respect will grow with time.  Like Stardust (2007) and Hairspray (2007), this movie (to me) is a surprise gem.  With great depth, flawless effects, and a perfect cast I would like to congratulate Danny Boyle for stepping in to science fiction and delivering such an unexpectedly top notch movie experience.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you want to know what happens, see \\"Most Helpful Review\\" and others following it--I'll save you time by skipping any recounting of the plot.  I love a good romance more than most. But let's get beyond the romance to the nitty-gritty.  SALIENT POINTS:   CASTING--The production is perfectly cast--one comes away with the conviction (as with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"--(Firth/Ehle version) that no other actors could possibly have filled any of these roles half so well. Whoever cast this should be knighted.  STANDOUT PERFORMANCES--Others have commented so thoroughly on the portrayal of Margaret and Thornton--and Mrs. Thornton--nothing more need be said.   I want to highlight--   (1.) actor Brendan Coyle's portrayal of Higgins, the mill worker.  His family's painful poverty make the Cratchits in  Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" appear flush by comparison.  Coyle brings Higgins to life with a melding of gritty determination, mischief and wit--see if he doesn't remind you of Bruce Willis (yes, Bruce Willis) in \\"Armageddon\\"--going up against impossible people in authority, yet outwitting them all. Coyle gives Higgins layered dimension.   In so doing, he makes the workers' plight all the more affecting. The viewer confronts the painful truth that these people on the bottom of society have much to offer, but being locked into their station in life, their gifts and talents are lost.  Higgins will become one of your favorites.  (2.) With a score of characters of such depth, it might be easy to overlook Higgins' daughter Bessie. Played by the actress who endeared herself to everyone as \\"Esther\\" in another BBC standout production, \\"Bleak House,\\" she gives another heart-wrenching performance.   SPEAKING OF \\"BLEAK HOUSE\\"--Steel yourself, this production is bleak. But the subject matter requires it to be exactly that. In Pride and Prejudice, no one dies.  N& S isn't as bad as the death scene in Hamlet where almost no one is left standing, but by Episode Four, one begins to wonder who'll be next. I'm not surprised to learn of the close professional relationship the author had with Charles Dickens---her book is truly Dickensian in theme, characters, setting and mood.  I felt his influence in every scene. This is not a criticism--her purpose, much like his, was to expose the tragic non-life of those who went unnoticed, almost unseen, by the upper classes in England.  NO, IT'S NOT P&P--But buy it anyway, as I'm about to do, since my college-age daughter, who brought it home this Christmas claiming it was the best thing she'd seen since P&P, wouldn't let me slip it out of her suitcase when she packed to return to grad school today. (sigh) I must now buy my own.  COMPARISONS--You will be tempted to compare N&S in almost every aspect to P&P. Those who are P&P purists (I am one) will find the comparison to be unfavorable--but also unjust.  The subject matter is so much darker, such comparisons are apples and oranges.  If P&P is the Rolls Royce of period novel productions, N&S comes in at least as a Bentley.    You have a serious (no pun intended) treat in store.
0143038419|5.0|If you have never had a \\"spiritual quest\\" of your own, you probably will not like this book, because you will have no basis of reference to the subject. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could hardly put it down. I admire people who are not afraid to look inside themselves and strive for improvement. I especially admire people who can write about it with humor. We can all improve ourselves, and this book may shed a little enlightenment on your own \\"quest\\".    Elizabeth Gilbert writes as if she is sitting in the room with you having a casual conversation - and she does it with a delightful personality, flaws and all. Her sense of humor comes through all the time, no matter what she is facing in her life. It felt good to read and to reflect on this book. My quest continues!

B00005JLR2|5.0|Although this adaptation is not the most accurate, I truly enjoyed it. This movie came out when I was twelve and I loved it. I still love it today and I think it is one of the most under rated Disney movies ever made. I like how it takes the classic story of Treasure Island and it gives it a different twist. Disney takes the classic story and makes it their own. If you are looking for a good reproduction of Treasure Island you might look elsewhere, but if you are looking for a really good movie that deals with pirates, treasure, flying ships, and a heart warming moral about growing up, then this is your movie. I give it five out of five stars.
B00078XGRO|4.0|The crew of the Enterprise-E pursues a Borg ship back in time to foil their plan to change human history by preventing mankind's first contact with another species.  This adventure is the best of the generally underwhelming Next Generation films, with good solid action and a fast-moving plot.  Still, my general criticism of these films remains--they all feel like expanded episodes of the TV series.  I really wish they had taken the opportunity to take these characters into new territory like the Original Series films did.  Even if they split up the crew, I'm sure that a talented writer could have devised stories that would have required them to come back together every couple years or so.

0307236722|5.0|this is one of the best baking books i have found. i like that there is a picture for everything..so you know what the final result should look like. i have had to tweek some of my recipes here and there, but all have ended in delicious results. ingredients and equipment do make a big difference; and test kitchens usually have higher quality equipment than the average home owner, so if i have to bake for a shorter/longer time, i just make note in the book. this book offers more recipes that are not found in many cookbooks, and it is a welcome addition to my collection. i highly recommend this to anyone who loves to bake and entertain. if a recipe does not turn out to your satisfaction the first time, evaluate and make it again. the results are always amazing!!!!!!!!!!
B00009V7P8|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  I listen to it almost every time I pick up my iPod or need to just relax.  It's so calming; I used to listen to it every night before I went to sleep.  Definitely an amazing buy.  :)
B000002LCK|5.0|This album I first heard in the late 1990s at one of my neighbor's house. The songs I love are \\"True Faith,\\" which I remembered the words for the longest time, and \\"Ceremony\\" and \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" are great as well. The songs are longer, but if you like dance music/techno this is an album for you. There are some vocals and some parts of the songs are instrumental.
0439813786|3.0|Kudos to this author for the unique concept of telling part of a story with pictures and part of the story with text. I wish that I could rave about this book, because I think the concept and art are magnificent!  The storyline...ok. This amalgam of a picture book and a children's story and an enhanced biography is definitely worth the read.  A clockmaker's son is orphaned and lives with his uncle minding the clocks of a large station. When the uncle temporarily disappears, the boy sustains himself by stealing and does the uncle's job to avoid being noticed by the authorities.  His main motivation of remaining in the station is to repair a damaged machine to retrieve a message his father may have programmed into the automated robot-of-sorts.  The boy continually escapes trouble narrowly and then ends up discovering a someone's secret identity.  Lots of questions were left unanswered, the concept of stealing being inappropriate was eventually minimized, and the relationship between his father,the \\"missing person,\\" and the robot were ultimately confusing.  It finished up too quickly at the end and, in doing so, left some loose threads.<br /><br />Do not be intimidated by the immensity of the book.  The majority of the book is fantastic drawings that tell the story far better than the text portions.  The expressions are very communicative and the scenes provide suspense and emotion.  Five stars for the concept of intertwining a word-less top-notch picture book with a child's text story.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Imagine all those times you chased that particularly annoying sibling around the house and finally came to the realization that perhaps all the running was for naught and that the best resort was to instead come up with some comment that would verbally slice through their persona so much that they would never bother you again. Perhaps it was a comment like, \\"You will never amount to anything\\" that quickly brought any sibling rivalry to a complete halt.<br /><br />But as is usually the case, the transgressions of our youth when it comes to fights between siblings are typically smoothed over as time goes on. We learn that our sibling(s) might actually not be as bad as we made them out to be and perhaps they have grown from just a sibling into a friend.<br /><br />However, imagine for a moment that as time goes on you start hanging out so much with your sibling that you now revert to smelling up a good ole fashion tour bus with them. Though it perhaps is not the reality that most of us live, for Meg and Jack White the return to sharing almost every day with a sibling is the life that they now are reliving. As The White Stripes , Meg and Jack have taken the world by storm and now have platinum albums, sold out concerts and all the other benefits of being true rock and rollers under the belts.<br /><br />With their album Icky Thump , The White Stripes have proven to music fans that they are in fact the real deal. With copies of this album simply flying off the shelves in record stores across the globe, The White Stripes have solidified their place in the current rock world as being perhaps amongst those who are at the top of the list.<br /><br />The White Stripes are Meg White (drums/vocals) and Jack White (guitar/vocals).<br /><br />The title track of the album is a well produced song that warrants having the album's good name rest upon the shoulders of this track. The song is a perfectly highlighting of the rest of the album and the music of The White Stripes and brings an important focus to the recognizable instrumental sounds The White Stripes have brought to their music. The vocals of Jack White are quickly established as being perhaps a bit out of the ordinary but remain impressive at the same time.<br /><br />St. Andrew is a rapidly paced song that truly toys with the musical emotions of the listener. With a sort of horror-infused vocal component to the track the music brings in a fast paced and cacophonous sounding bagpipe sound that changes so sporadically it is hard to gather much from the track. The track is a hodge-podge of sounds meant to serve as a break from the rest of the album but perhaps it is not given enough credit. Truly what The White Stripes have done on this track is create a uniquely bizarre sound that is certainly not like any other.<br /><br />The album winds down nicely with the track Effect and Cause . This track is a well produced and perhaps most musically well polished track on the album. The acoustic guitar holds together the track well and the vocals on this song take a much more lyrical approach than the other tracks of the album. The song is a true performance song and does not rely on heavy studio sounds and would be the ideal concert song to hear done cleanly live. Though the rest of the album adequately does justice to the music of The White Stripes, this track is the best glimpse into the true musical brilliance that serves as the backbone to the group.<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />1.

0140157352|5.0|In the fields of negotiation and mediation, one small book has had a tremendous impact.  Published in 1981, Roger Fisher and William Ury's book, Getting to Yes, introduced the concept of \\"principled\\" or \\"interest-based\\" bargaining.  It is difficult to find a negotiation or mediation course that does not reference this landmark text.  It is one of the most well-known works in negotiation literature and has been the focus of considerable commentary by legal scholars.  Some of the book's strengths are its discussions on separating the people from the problem and focusing on interests, rather than  positions.  This book introduced the term BATNA, your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement, the standard against which Fisher and Ury claim any proposed agreement should be measured.  It make sense, because using your BATNA as a standard, you can protect yourself or your clients from accepting terms that are too unfavorable and from rejecting terms it would be in your interest to accept.  The lessons on principled negotiation are well worth the short amount of time it will take to read this book.<br /><br /> Principled negotiation, as espoused by Fisher and Ury, is an approach to bargaining that expands \\"the pie\\" rather than just dividing it as with distributive bargaining.  Principled negotiation is the win-win approach that is also referred to as integrative bargaining.  In contrast, distributive bargaining generally assumes a zero-sum position where plus one for me equals minus one for you.  Both approaches, distributive and integrative have a place on the bargaining table.  Having a clear understanding of both approaches enables an attorney to be more flexible when representing clients' interests in negotiations and mediations.  It is not uncommon for a party to take an integrative approach at the outset of a negotiation and switch to distributive bargaining sometime during the process.  This is usually when the interests are being explored early on, and then actual negotiations regarding money become the focus at the end.  When dollars are being discussed, distributive bargaining is most common.  Sometimes a party will take the distributive approach when the negotiations commence and then become more integrative when a deal or settlement is not reached with the competitive method.  The successful attorney prepares for negotiations and considers which approach, or what combination of approaches, makes the most sense for the matter at hand.<br /><br /> The classic example many mediation and negotiation trainers use to illustrate the differences between distributive and integrative bargaining comes from Getting to Yes and involves two sisters quarreling over a single orange.  Each sister's position is she needs 100% of the orange.  Using a distributive approach, for one sister to gain some of the orange, the other must lose.  The mediator or negotiator using a distributive approach may come up with a solution as mom did when she entered the kitchen and found the two sisters arguing over who should have the orange.  Wanting to be fair to both of her daughters, mom the mediator proposed this solution.  One daughter would cut the orange in half and the other daughter would choose which half she would receive.  Over all, this seems like a fair and reasonable solution, and in fact, this is how many disputes are resolved and how many negotiations play out.  Each sister gets 50% of what they wanted.  The result achieves fairness and arguably a win-win solution.  But can we do better?<br /><br /> Using Fisher and Ury's principled approach, the focus is shifted to the sisters' interests rather than their positions.  This time, rather than just proposing a solution, mom the mediator seeks to understand and find out why each sister wants the orange.  Mom discovers that one sister does not really even like oranges, but she wants to bake a Christmas cake which calls for the peels of one orange.  The other girl wants to eat the fruit and plans to toss the peels into the garbage.  Learning the interests of each person, rather than just knowing their positions, allows for creative and often much more satisfying results.  By giving the peel to the first girl, and the fruit to her sister, each girl receives 100% of what she wanted for a truly win-win solution.<br /><br /> If only all problems were that easy to solve!  If they were, many of us would be out of jobs.  Real problems are often much more complex, and very rarely can you get 100% for each party, but many times you can do better than 50/50.  It takes some effort learning interest based principles and incorporating them into negotiations and a willingness to look beyond the distributive solutions and expand \\"the pie\\" based on parties' interests rather than positions, but the solutions and results obtained are well worth the time and effort.<br /><br /> For the person who wants to expand \\"the pie\\" of negotiation skills to better serve clients, Getting to Yes is a quick read with useful insights and techniques.  The book has been criticized as neglecting a significant part of the negotiation process (distributive bargaining) and oversimplifying many of the troublesome problems inherent in the art and practice of negotiation.  Nonetheless, it contains useful techniques and valid criticism regarding negotiation and should be read by every practicing attorney, especially those involved with mediation.  It is especially useful for those who tend to only negotiate with a distributional or distributive approach.  I encourage everyone to read this small negotiating gem and incorporate the problem solving techniques in their negotiations and explore mutual profitable resolutions in their mediations.<br /><br />Reviewed by Alain Burrese, J.D., author of a regular column on Negotiation for The Montana Lawyer.the garbage.

B000MNP2KI|1.0|If you are looking for a exciting 007 movie, you will be very dissspointed. There is no action in movies but some stupid fights where Daniel Craig gets all beat up. Daniel is a fair actor but he is no way a James Bond, give me back Sean Connery, or even Roger Moore. Daniel Craig is NOT a convincing Bond, he even got rejected repeately by Evan Green (she is hot though). The ultimate was Daniel Craig was caught by his nemesis, got his cloths all riped off and tied naked to a chair. Then got tortured with a rope hammer hitting his posterior. Give me a break, this is not James Bond. It is SO embarrasing seeing James Bond tied naked and tortured. I give up.  The movie has more twist than a Hitchcock movie but no action. James Bond gambling movie??? Come on, Bond never loses in a Casino.  It deserves half a star for Evan Green being hot.

B00003CXXS|1.0|Now I absolutely love `Jurassic Park' and even though it falters in areas I firmly defend `The Lost World' but truthfully there is nothing I can say to defend the mess that is `Jurassic Park III'.  Sadly this film is lacking in every area, from script to acting to (god forbid) special effects, which actually look like they have gotten worse as apposed to improving since the first installment.  From the moment Grant dreams of the raptor on the plane I knew that I was in for a disappointment, but it wasn't until actor Trevor Morgan threw his first smoke bomb that I realized just what a GIANT disappointment this film was going to prove to be.<br /><br />`Jurassic Park III' (they didn't even come up with a catchy name for it) reacquaints us with paleontologist Alan Grant.  Grant is approached by the Kirby's who want him to escort them to Isla Sorna, yet another island infested with dinosaurs.  They want his expertise as they `fly' over the island, someone to point out the sights, but that isn't their real intentions at all.  No, they intend to land the plane, something Grant did not sign up for, and this sends the group into a dangerous journey to find and rescue the Kirby's young son who happened to crash land on the island in the first few moments of the film.<br /><br />I'm getting a headache just thinking about reviewing this mess of a film.  The problem is that the script is so haphazard, so NOT thought through at all.  To think that this young kid would survive on his own, let alone defend himself and others against hunting machines such as raptors is beyond ridiculous.  The acting is horrendous.  I loved Sam Neil in the first film but you can tell that he is board with this venture.  Tea Leoni and William H. Macy must have been mentality unstable when they signed on to do this film, it is so beneath them.  Sadly, what should have been the best part of the movie was the worst.  Yes, the god AWFUL special effects make this the worst installment of the `Jurassic Park' franchise.  The scene where the newer, bigger dinosaur rolls over the plane is enough to make you want to vomit.<br /><br />So, it is clear that I loathe this film.  It is a pointless dip in the cash cow that was `Jurassic Park' that proved to be a nauseating cinematic experience.  I'll never, I repeat NEVER, watch this film again and I advise any who have not seen it to stay far, far away.  If you have seen it, well then I feel your pain.The scene where the newer, bigger dinosaur rolls over the plane is enough to make you want to vomit.    So, it is clear that I loathe this film.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Before tampering with prehistoric predators, Spielberg gave us a giant fish.  That giant fish proves to this day to be one of the most horrifying and successfully bone chilling creatures in movie history.  I stand by the belief that `Jaws' is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It has all the components of a good thriller and satisfies the moviegoer from start to finish.<br /><br />The plot is simple.  Amity Island is being terrorized by a great white shark.  The new police chief Martin Brody is working very hard, despite the contempt from the town's mayor, to keep the beaches empty and the body count minimal.  After some heavy persuasion and a few lost lives the mayor, Larry Vaughn, finally agrees to hire Quint, a shark hunter, to kill this great white.  Accompanying Quint on his hunt is Brody as well as shark expert Matt Hooper.  The film really takes a turn for the superb as these men soon realize that they are indeed being hunted by the shark.  The madness sets in slowly and the film's finale is jaw dropping.<br /><br />I think that everyone who has ever seen `Jaws' can attest to the fact that the opening sequence with young Chrissie Watkins decides to skinny dip in the dangerous waters stands alone as one of the most heart racing and all around gut wrenching scenes in motion picture history.  I was a young boy the first time I saw `Jaws' and for what felt like years I was unable to swim in the deep end of my pool, always fearing I'd be tugged under in the same manor as young Watkins was.  This is the reason that `Jaws' is a classic.  It stays with you.  Sure, the shark looks fake when we finally have the chance to see it full on, but to be completely honest it's not the shark that scared us in the first place.  It was the idea of the shark, the undeniable knowledge that he was on his way to devour you.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is a masterful director and he turns out yet another brilliant picture in `Jaws'.  The mood created by the lighting, the music and the camera angles (I know the whole `shooting from the sharks perspective' was done on account of the mechanical shark being `out of order' half the time, but it was brilliant) helps terrify the audience.  While not technically a `horror' film, `Jaws' sends more chills, more realistic and meaningful chills, than many quote-unquote `horror' films that litter our cinemas today.<br /><br />The cast is all at the top of their games here.  Roy Scheider manages to make Martin Brody relatable and real to the audience, and Murray Hamilton captures the pompous selfishness surrounding Larry Vaughn perfectly.  It's Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss though who take the cake so-to-speak in regards to electric performances.  Shaw is magnificent as Quint and Dreyfuss breathes so much life into Hooper.  I just love Dreyfuss and this performance is yet another reason why.<br /><br />`Jaws' may not be your favorite film but there is no denying its powerful presence.  Anyone who has ever seen this film must admit that it had a huge impact on how they viewed a leisure swim.  And who can forget that commanding score.  I still hear that fear inspiring composition every time I get in the water.I know the whole `shooting from the sharks perspective' was done on account of the mechanical shark being `out of order' half the time, but it was brilliant) helps terrify the audience.

B0009S2T0W|4.0|Oldboy is a great movie, and it may even deserve a full 5 stars, however I just can't bring myself to give it a full 5.<br />I loved this movie, it had all the elements to be a 5 star movie, great script, great acting, and lots of unexpected twists & turns that keep you guessing til the very end! However, (and maybe this is just me...) once I got to the end of the movie, (despite the fact that it left me in awe) I almost wished that I hadn't...<br />Oldboy, in essence, is pure genius. But the utterly revolting incestuous sex scenes took off a star for me. It may be unfair, because those scenes did have a point, and because they added to the overall shock value once Oh Dae Su found out that Mi-do (his lover) was actually his daughter and that his captor had orchestrated the whole thing, their meeting, their friendship, and them falling in love. It was pure brilliance...<br />So why did I take off a star? Because of Dae Su's decission to forget the awful truth about Mi-do, the woman that he loved so much, being his daughter through way of hypnosis. It was tragic, it was brilliant, but it's simply not the sort of thing I would've done if I were in his shoes...<br />The verdict? 4 out of 5 Stars. It was a great movie with a tragic yet brilliant ending. However, incest is just gross... And Dae Su's decission to forget the truth in order to stay with the woman he loved is what stopped me from giving it 5 Stars.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|I first saw this film on videotape and was amazed at the way music; videos, interviews, and great pictures of art can be brought together to make a movie. I can watch this over and over and still enjoy its magic. It shows the cross over to Dark side of the moon. It shows how each artist shines on their part.   The DVD has more footage than the original cut. The quality of video and sound is excellent. Every Pink Floyd collection should have this in it.

B000RJO58M|5.0|I guess I should start by saying that there are a few gory scenes (campy and not excessive, but there), but even people who close their eyes during those scenes will be delighted with this movie.  Its clever and relevant and the twists will surprise you.  Its wonderfully well cast (the creators are also the stars, but they are excellent in those roles).  The script is funny and there are some great quotables (for those who like that sort of thing).      My boyfriend and I saw a lot of movies in 2007 and we both think this was one of the best.  It doesn't have any sweeping period romance or dramatic scenes, so you may not see it on the award nominations but I would feel confident that just about anyone familiar with popular culture (specifically regarding action/cop flicks) over the last 10 years or so will love it.
B000VR824S|5.0|one can't help but compare crossroads 2 to its predecessor. though  initially i was a bit disappointed but after seeing it a couple more  times i'm more than satisfied.    sonny landreth the slide guitar maestro opens the show with a bang. in  his second song he even invites clapton for a duel.    john mclaughlin who recorded the best performance in the first crossroads,  disappoints slightly here.    doyle brahmhall is hardly impressive and seems to me to lack confidence for he seems to often looks towards clapton for approval. his slide version of cream's 'outside woman blues' is not too bad. but that's the best you can say.    susan tedeschi performs a traditional blues number and is competent. her husband derek trucks follows her with a rousing version of derek and the dominoes \\"anyday\\" which lyrics clapton on the sidelines could be seen mouthing. derek is a major talent seemingly comfortable with both the bottleneck and regular lead playing.    what follows is imo the highlight of the show - johnny winter's rousing version of 'highway 61'. yea, this is the old bull of the woods, all right. old and bent he is - but that doesn't prevent him from giving a spirited performance. the mini-humbuckers on his gibson firebird literally growl with his deft slide playing. derek trucks supporting him can be seen in one instance leaning over to get a glimpse of the albino's slide work.    robert randoph is great - but imo they could have invited jeff healy who too plays a similar lap slide and is a great player - this time.    robert cray in contrast to the earlier crossroads gives a mediocre performance.    jimi vaughn and hubert sumlin play ok sets.    bb king delivers way more than the previous time. he repeats \\"rock me baby\\" which he played at the texas crossroads but his signature vibrato is on full display here and he plays lick after delicious lick.    i'm not a fan of country music and so can't really comment on vince gill or albert lee or willy nelson. sheryl crow looks pretty and this seems to be acknowledged by everybody from albert lee to willy nelson to clapton and apparently to the chagrin of vince neal.    john mayer has matured as a guitarist from his previous performance at texas and it clearly shows here. and he has a great slide guitarist supporting him as well. atlast i am convinced enough to check out some of his music on cd.    los lobos give a rousing set. they have two great guitarists in both the lead singer and david hidalgo.    jeff beck and his young bassist tal wilkenfeld literally amaze. jeff is quite different from other guitarists and this show clearly shows why - he uses every dynamic in the guitar to express himself. i thought tal was actually his daughter as he seems to be so proud of her. and that she's 21 is surprising as she looks 12! but she is a great player with a dazzling touch. but it is a pity that they did not include jeff beck's interpretation of the beatles 'day in the life' - i would have loved to hear that.    robbie robertson gives a great interpretation of bo diddley's 'who do you love'. clapton can't but resist playing along.    this seems to be a show for clapton to remember the good old days. he gives a rousing performance of derek and the dominoes \\"tell the truth\\" ably supported by derek trucks.    then he joins steve winwood and they do the old 'blind faith' tracks - 'had to cry today' (with winwood playing seconds lead) and 'presence of the lord' and cream's 'crossroads'.    next winwood goes solo and does a fantastic version of traffic's 'dear mr fantasy'. he plays some very melodic lines on his guitar.    buddy guy, the local chicago \\"authority\\", opens up with 'mary had a little lamb' and also does \\"damn right i have the blues\\". he is old now and it shows in the rigid movement of his fingers. but still buddy is buddy ...    \\"sweet home chicago\\" with everybody participating winds up the show.    i can't help but wonder why they did not invite warren haynes who is probably the best guitarist in america today. also joe bonamassa who is a phenomenal new talent. dweezil zappa also could have provided a different flavour to the music. also no metal representation this time as with steva vai last time. the exotic element as represented by the indian slide guitarist vishva mohan bhatt last time is missing. they could have invited prasanna, the guitarist from southern india who fuses  rock with classical indian carnatic music. those interested in such music (ala mahavishnu orchestra etc) should check out his \\"electric ganesha land\\" - a carnatic guitarist's tribute to jimi hendrix!    a final note about the guitars used : the best looking guitar is the tangerine burst (?) single cut used by susan tedeschi. not sure what the make of the beauty is - guild?. mclaughlin is seen sporting a godin. derek trucks plays his usual gibson 61 reissue sg. johnny winter  his trademark gibson firebird and bb king his lucille. david hidalgo plays a tele, but strats rule! the great majority of the players - clapton, buddy, jimi vaughn, mayer, robbie robertson, jeff beck, winwood - all play fender strats.     a must for anybody who loves the guitar.    wonder where the next crossroads festival will be ... nashville?
B00000294R|5.0|When this album first came out it received very little press and was not commercial success but as time went on it became a underground hit and now is receiving more than in 1995.     Big L was only 24 when he was shot in his Harlem neighborhood but was considered one the top lyricists, he ranks with 2pac , B.I.G. His style is a mix of several things. He uses humor and punch lines to amuse his fans on songs like put it on, size em up but also uses a gritty and disturbing style too in songs like all black, street stuck making him a very special lyricists. Like 2pac and Biggie was not a rapper he was a poet.
B000000WG4|1.0|I looked forward to buying this for a very long time.  Every comment on CD Now or anywhere else not only looked favorable but also portrayed this album as a \\"must have\\" classic.      Unlike others who experienced the same disappointment with this recording, I didn't mind the long instrumentals.  I even found them relaxing, but the raging voice track that appears in the second and last song is just weird.  Why would you do that to a song?  I remember Iron Butterfly did it with a song on their Metamorphosis album I listened to when I was a teen, and although it was strange, it worked somehow.  This didn't do anything for me but make me angry that I wasted hare-earned cash on this crap.    You do not want this recording unless you are a rabid fan of Mike Oldfield.  Personally, I will never buy anything else he created.  If you want this CD because of something written by an adoring fan who loves Tubular Bells, first, take a look at anything by Pink Floyd--a band that made fantastic music worth five stars.      I gave this one one star, because I couldn't choose a lower option.
B00007LTIC|4.0|A Yes album, what next?<br />I admit to being stumped by this 'prog' thing; it's not something that keeps me awake at night - but I do worry.<br /><br />For a start my cred hones in at just below Baked Beans at the mere thought of a (HORROR!) Yes album. Even as I scribe I can hear the mocking ghosts of my 'alternative' past; jeering the act of placing a Yes album in my cd player.<br />The restless spirits of a hundred obscure indie groups rustle in the ashes of your humble narrators previous musical preferences, calling  me away, away from the madness.<br />I feel somewhere in an unforeseen future, I will pay for this transgression.<br /><br />But for now, 'Going For The One'.<br />A fine album.<br />Did I really just write that? Have I fallen so far? What happens now? Does this represent ultimate dismal failure in the field of rock reviewing?<br />The answer to all these questions is Yes.<br /><br />Apart from the title track, which is a bit bland for moi's honed hearing -'GFTO' is indeed a fine album.<br />'Turn of the Century' and 'Wonderous Stories' are superb ballads, while the scorching 'Parallels' is a pacy rocker, driven along by ludicrously loud church organ and fearsome guitar.<br />Impressive, and rewarding if you are in any way a music fan.<br />Ah, but what about the self-indulgent 15 minute saga at the end? Well, it's excellent as well. Builds to a rousing climax and lets face it, it wouldn't be a Yes album without a self-indulgent, 15 minute saga somewhere in its rucksack.<br /><br />A typically cynical 'old' Ess doubt:<br />Did Rick Wakeman REALLY need to go to Switzerland to record that fabulous cathedral-organ sound?<br />Didn't they have one in Swansea or Swindon ?<br />In the storming context of 'GFTO', he undoubtedly did and there's something comforting in that ludicrous indulgence; something cheery in the thought that he probably had to bung the incumbent a new roof or buy a mini-bus for some orphans in order that 'Parallels' can sound as good as it does.<br /><br />It's a clich&eacute; but 'GFTO' - despite all my cynical misgivings - makes a strange kind of sense.<br />It's very much a complete work, a sum component of all it's parts. A totality in rock sensibility, and is slightly subversive because of it.<br /><br />After listening to it 6 times in a row, I don't feel I'm any closer to  understanding its ideals and philosophies, just like I'm no closer to offering anything in the way of explanation of this 'prog' thing.<br />In fact, the Yes album further muddies the water.<br /><br />To my mind, and 20 odd years of throwaway sensibility have engraved this in granite - it's about the music ultimately; and on that score 'GFTO' isn't found wanting.<br />Now, Grateful Dead did you say?gs - makes a strange kind of sense.   It's very much a complete work, a sum component of all it's parts. A totality in rock sensibility, and is slightly subversive because of it.    After listening to it 6 times in a row, I don't feel I'm any closer to  understanding its ideals and philosophies, just like I'm no closer to offering anything in the way of explanation of this 'prog' thing.   In fact, the Yes album further muddies the water.    To my mind, and 20 odd years of throwaway sensibility have engraved this in granite - it's about the music ultimately; and on that score 'GFTO' isn't found wanting.  Now, Grateful Dead did you say?
B000003TA4|5.0|I love this album and listen to it a few times a year since it came out. Why? Probably for a different reason than what Kurt and company intended: I love the melodies. You can have the lyrics (OK Ok, I'm odd), but give me the music. Each song has a complex melody behind it (a string quartet recorded 'Nevermind' very artfully), that keeps me listening to this year after year.    Back in the 80's Peter Buck described his band, REM, as being \\"the acceptable edge of the unacceptable stuff\\" (melodic pop enough for the masses while still maintaining some punk attitude--\\"Radio Free Europe\\" for example). I think 'Nevermind' has this same effect. Pop melodies with punk energy and full mid-high range distortion and lyrics that even a dissolutioned teenager could relate with.     This album works on multiple levels and even though Kurt didn't think this was their best, I disagree with him. For me, 'Nevermind' has a Beatles like quality and longevity to it. (Kurt was influenced by the Beatles wasn't he?)    So buy this record. Also, if you like this, pick up the string quartet 'Nevermind' CD and you'll see what I mean about the tunes.
B000LC55F2|3.0|The good:<br />it wasn't boring - it was one of these where you don't want to run to take a pee because you worry you will miss something important.<br /><br />I've seen the other magician movie: \\"The Illusionist\\" (twice) and found it magical in every sense.  It had a great ending, satisfying and a great surprise.<br /><br />  The bad:<br />Prestige had more magical tricks but lacked... magic.<br />Someone described it as \\"pointlessly macabre\\" and I cannot agree more.<br />I won't go over all ridiculous twists and turns becuase almost all movies can be taken apart by analysing them, but Prestige has one of these super-contorted plots.<br /><br />Interestingly, to all the heap of BS the Tesla subplot was surpisingly well researched,  and rooted in reality (other than his \\"ultimate\\" machine).  Even Tesla's historic feud with Thomas Edison, his stay in Colorado Springs, etc.  It was almost as if two different screenwritters wrote the movie: one doing the Tesla part and the other one everything else.  The movie was a strange mix of facts and fiction.<br /><br />And yes, I did mention it already, it was macabre - needlessly so.  The ending was depressing.  Entertaining while we watched but left a bad taste in our mouth...
B000W07EKW|4.0|Five years after the first in the Bourne Trilogy, came the last in the trilogy. So it was then that I decided to sit down with all three for my first look at each.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00023B1LC The Bourne Identity]], [[ASIN:B0002ZDVEU The Bourne Supremacy]] and [[ASIN:B000VWYJ86 The Bourne Ultimatum]] all tie together nicely. Is it necessary to view them chronologically to comprehend what's going on? Probably not. Does it help? Most definitely. So this collection is perfect for anyone like me that has never seen the first two of the three films.<br /><br />Writer Tony Gilroy adapted all three films to the screen from three Robert Ludlum novels of the same name. Identity has a different (little known) director than the (little known) director of Supremacy and Ultimatum...but you'd never know it; all three are as hectically paced with fight and chase scenes that will blow viewers out of their chairs. So kudos to Gilroy for putting together 3 scripts that each director could easily translate onto film.<br /><br />Getting chased is the story of Jason Bourne's life. Fighting those who dare to chase him is Jason Bourne's game. Bourne is a government agent with an 'identity' crisis. And if there was ever a guy who could say, \\"the world is out to get me,\\" and mean it, it's him. These three action-packed movies will keep you on the edge of (if not knock you off of) your seat for a good 6 hours.<br /><br />Great entertainment in one package for viewing at your convenience. Buy it up.
B00122O34O|5.0|I have listened to this soundtrack about 10 times now and thoroughly love it.  I have since gone out and bought the Moldy Peaches album and highly recommend it as well.  This soundtrack goes right along with the best movie soundtracks ever and you will still be listening to it for years to come.
B000K15VSA|4.0|...except, as noted elsewhere on this page, hardly anything about the matchless score by Vangelis. A few minutes of stills of Vangelis, while Ridley Scott and others comment on the music, is all we get. Among the fans of Blade Runner, the music is inseperable from the film - and an interview with Vangelis would've seemed mandatory to me.<br /><br />In the first few minutes of the movie,when Gaff's spinner is climbing up through the canyons between bldgs, and the Vangelis score takes over the soundtrack for a few moments - that is the moment when most people I know began a hypnotic freefall into the story. The music tells us this is a future of both progress and decay, just as poignantly as the equally matchless production design does. It looks like a future many of us have privately feared, and here it is, coming at you, like a \\"post-modern cocktail of ecstasy and dread\\", as William Gibson described cyberpunk in general.<br /><br />Beyond that glaring exclusion (thus only 4 stars), the information and insights available here are great enough to interest even a non-BR freak. The featurettes all had me glued to the screen - seeing the actors as they look today, interspersed with various of their scenes from the film. (As others have pointed out, I can't understand why Joanna Cassidy isn't a much bigger star) The segment on the correcting of certain continuity errors for the Final Cut version was absoulutely fascinating. If you just want to learn a lot about movie making, these DVD's are required watching.<br /><br />The story behind Rutger Hauer's iconic death scene, the smoky ambience, the lighting challenges and the numerous production design details that never made it onto film are all covered in the extras, and enable you to relive some of the movie's magic, that may have dimmed for you after multiple viewings over the years. Blade Runner is re-presented to us with flourishes and awe and affection from its creators,  that we've had to largely piece together for ourselves-until now. As I watched the interviews and documentaries, I found myself with a lump in my throat more than once-the same one I felt the first time I watched Roy Batty die.rselves-until now.

0743486285|5.0|This book is EXCELLENT!  Every single page of this book is like a work of art.  Each page is slick and has drawings, or poetry, or lost lyrics.  I've never seen a book put together so well.  The brutal honesty Nikki Sixx shares with us in this book is.......addicting.  I literally had a hard time putting it down.  I burned through it in just a few days and as soon as I was done, I flipped back to the start and started it again.<br />I would recommend this book to ANYONE.  Although I don't know if it would be as riveting if you weren't a Motley Crue fan.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Dublin guitarist/singer-songwriter who makes a living by fixing vacuum cleaners with his Dad in a repair shop and singing and playing for money on the Dublin streets by night. A Czech girl (who sells flowers and cleans houses) happens to listen in and they get drawn together while they share their past lives.  Enjoy great music weaved into a plot (which was fully expected to be predictable but turned out not to be exactly so).  Movie beautifully portrays simple, at times awkward, but warm relationships between Father and Son, between Czech girl and mother/daughter and of course between boy and girl.  Light inspirational story of underdogs dreaming big.  Beautifully shot in Ireland.  Loved it...
0061122416|1.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" is the kind of book that some will love and others will hate. It depends upon how much you are grounded in your own belief system, how much you embrace pop new age philosophy, or how open you are to anything that just \\"sounds good.\\"    Much of \\"The Alchemist\\" is redundant, and a re-packaging of many different philosophies, proverbs and sayings. Most of these things are obvious truisms, such as the idea that in pursuit of one's dreams or goals there are obstacles along the way that need to be overcome (\\"if at first you don't succeed, etc....\\"). As such, \\"The Alchemist\\" doesn't offer anything particulary brilliant or new, so the popularity of this novel is itself a mystery.    Part of the trouble for me is the telling of this story in its \\"dumbed-down\\" style. The simplicity of the telling might appeal to some but I like something with a bit more meat to it. Once the cosmic philosophy is removed, there is nothing left but a children's fable that is rather bland at best, since none of the characters have any depth to them. They are mere props being used for Coelho to impart his own philosophy.    Perhaps from a philosophical point of view, the most disturbing aspect of Coelho's novel is the lack of any moralizing over good and evil. Individuals trying to pursue their dreams may sound like an innocent enough theme, but in the real world, the goals/dreams (or pursuit of one's \\"Personal Legend\\") of many people are selfishly effected at the expense or sacrifice of others. This apparently doesn't matter to Coelho's indifferent universe. One gets the impression that Coelho's universe will conspire to help you regardless of whether what you are seeking is the good, the bad, the materialistic, or the spiritual...the important thing is that you are persistent and are adept at reading the omens along the way.    Coelho's contradictory belief system is made evident in the interview of the \\"Plus\\" version of \\"The Alchemist.\\" He describes himself as a Catholic, yet not tied into believing in the religion's espousing to be the \\"Ultimate Truth.\\" The problem is, that is what Catholicism teaches, and if you do not subscribe to that, then you really should not call yourself a Catholic. The notion that all beliefs point to the same truth is itself a contradiction, since most belief systems are exclusionary by definition.    This illustrates how sloppy Coelho is in his thinking and writing, and if you are going to try and enjoy \\"The Alchemist\\", just don't think about it too deeply.
B000V6BE6M|4.0|For LOR fans and collectors, the Trilogy's Complete Recordings seem to be Perfect, with their features, the quality of sound recording and everything.  Only, in my opinion, what make them not absolutely perfect as it should be is the colors of the boxes which are the same colors of the special extended DVDs', but the items are color switching. Set 1 box should be green, not red, Set 2 should be red, not blue, and Set 3 should be blue, not green. If the colors of the soundtracks box sets are match with the DVDs', don't you think it Absolutely Perfect on your shelves?
B0006IIKS0|1.0|I was first introduced to these guy's back in about 1996, when a few high school buddies kept saying this band was so great and everyone loves them. Well, I could never stand anything from their first couple of albums, and I disliked them at first, but then the Black album grew on me and by the time \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" came out, I was kind of a fan of theirs.    Many fans criticize the 'load' and 'reload' albums, but i liked alot of the tracks from those albums. They came to my city to play a live show, and we were all pumped up, ready to rock out. We walk into the stadium and see that the stage they used for every show was not there. They (sellouttica) did not bother to set it up, because it was easier and cheaper for them to set it up in the next city instead of paying out someone to set-up the stage here... then they where 2 hours late coming to stage, and even being 2 hours late, they still put the support band on first, and everyone booed them for the 40 minutes they played.    Then, finally, James \\"Cowardly Lion\\" Hetfield walks out on stage... no introduction, no reason why the show was delayed, nope, just four guys, walk out, and 5 mins later eventually start. No intro, no fancy way to start, just 4 guys like, \\"lets get this over and done with, and get the heck out of here\\".    They played a song or two, and then James is screaming at security to get some camera off someone who had taken a picture of the band with flash photography. When we first entered that stadium, everyone had to go through metal detectors, not to find guns or knives, but cameras! It made me sick that you pay so much and wait so long to see a band you love, especially when you're the reason they are even in business, and they (sellouttica) have the nerve to not let you take pictures for personal memories?    Then later in that show, I was sickened at these guys performance. They didn't look like they where having any fun, and looked like they didn't want to be there, yet the crowed was going nuts for them. If they (crowed) had have stop bobbing their heads around and looked up for a second, they would see 4 guys on stage thinking, 'we could play arvey maria and just fart into the mic and these suckers would still pay to come see us... thanks for the money you have given us, losers'    They (sellouttica) had informed security to confiscate any camera found, and eject those people from the building. They where being kicked out all night, and James even stopped the song and said something like if they see another camera go off, they would stop playing and leave.    So, the show did come to an end on it's own and not prematurely. A friend of mine knew their set-list and said that the song they where playing was the second last song, after it was the last song... so we headed to the exits of the stadium, just so once the song was over, we could get a head start on the crowed to get out of there quicker. So we are standing there near the exit and 2 security guys start hassling us about what we where doing...just standing there.... we said the real reason, we didn't lie, and he's like, \\"no, you're going to try and run on stage\\".... run on stage??? we where in the very back row of the stadium, it would take an hour to make our way through the crowed to get to the stage, and there is one song left to go?? they made us return to our seats or leave.    Oh yeah, and another thing, when the show started, the crowed where doing that mosh-pit surfing-trampoline-thing where the crowed throws a person up in the air and catches them like a trampoline... well, this one chick is being thrown 10 to 15 feet in the air, and then eventually SMACK!!, right into the ground. You could hear laughter in the mosh pit. Security is all over it and she is stretchered away, I heard snickers from someone who had a mic from the band, but they wouldn't look in that general direction of that incident, they just kept on playing like it was not happening, and didn't look like they could care less about it either. The next day in the paper it said that girl is now crippled. Sellouttica wouldn't even acknowledged it to inform the crowed to let the paramedics through to get to her.    After seeing that show and experiencing Moneytakia for myself, I did not like this band much any more. I had little respect for them and would always say \\"I like some of their music, but as people, I can not stand them\\"    Then they released S&M & Garage Days and I thought to myself, \\"This band isn't even trying anymore, they're just in it for the money\\"    I disliked the band from that point on, but when the whole Napster thing came around and Lars is sulking on MTV when they gave the Napster kid an award, I saw nothing but selfishness from guys who just want money, the more the merrier, and if anyone takes some away from them, then they throw a tantrum.    By the time St. Anger came out, I hated this band. I still have never listened to that album, and I never will.    So, I thought to myself, maybe I'm being to judgmental? Maybe I should watch this documentary about the band and I might find some redeeming quality for them I did not know about.... pfffftt, BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA    So, this thing starts and I'm thinking to myself, \\"Is this Spinal Tap?, am I watching the right thing here?\\" even the manager or whoever the guy was in this looked like Michael Mckean (singer for Tap). The band is having \\"problems\\", \\"emotional issues\\" and need to find their \\"zone\\" to be \\"deep\\". All being discussed with the band therapist, who wants to be the 5th member of the band. Annoying.    Kirk and Lars are like \\"lets rock man\\" and James is like \\"I don't wanna\\" and Lars is like, \\"James, you're a pooh pooh head\\" and James is like \\"NO I AM NOT\\" *door slams and runs to mommy*    Geesh, these guys wouldn't know a real problem if it rented space up there %$#@. So James is depressed, the alcohol is getting to him, and we're supposed to feel sorry for a millionaire who made his own choice to drink too much? Then Lars is crying away about how James is a douche-bag and his bands falling apart and then for no reason, they add this hilarious scene of Lars selling his paintings at an auction and saying he doesn't care how much they go off for, yet has to get drunk during the auction to take it...mmmmk yeah... or how about James saying he doesn't like attention or tries to bring any attention to himself, then is seen driving down the freeway in his hotrod waving at everyone.... yeah... okay, not much attention to be sought out there!    Their therapy is a joke... you either keep that ^%$# private, or expect people will think you are now practicing alternative lifestyles. Then they start communicating to each other like the therapist does to them and they discuss their feelings with each other now. You will either roll your eyes or die laughing.    Overall, the most hilarious thing about this movie is it's the recording of what became St. Anger. And the movie ends on a note saying that the album was released and went to #1 in 30 countries blah blah blah... doesn't mention how it didn't stay there for very long! Fails to mention its the worst album the band has ever put out. Avoids mentioning how it sealed the deal that it was the first proper album since RELOAD that the band has done and so many fans said \\"to hell\\" with this band, they can't come up with decent material anymore.    All I know is, after watching this group of spoiled rock stars who winged and wine about everything and sell out their music... and are money hoggers, I expect a sequel to this documentary that starts with the band realizing how damaging to their career it was to show their real life, in which they have all lost touch with reality. And the band sit around and say, \\"Right, we thought St. Anger was going to be great, but it bombed, it was worse then Garbage Days, and fans say we can not cut it anymore, and i feel this deep emotional roller coaster on a sea of anxiety that is invading my comfort zone man, why don't we just quit making albums, and release that bootleg of of ours and sell it for the same price as the bootleg, ya know that ummm, live s48645 binge and purge thing? yeah, lets make it an official album and DVD and sell it for the same price, no, 3 times as much as the bootleg! That way we make our money back on it and get back those people who made bootlegs of it, yeah, that will show them! (only it's going to create better quality bootlegs now) Then maybe we can shut down kazza, and limewire, and torrents, or lets shut down the internet all together and ban computers and we will be rich beyond what we already are\\" - \\"but that would DISAPPOINT our fans\\" - \\"whats fans? oh the guys whose money we scam, dude, as long as fans have an IQ under 28, we will always be able to scam their money!!! We should now call the band KissTellica\\"  - the end
038572179X|5.0|I read this before the movie came out, and I'm so glad I did. Plot details are easily available and much-discussed already elsewhere, so I'm just going to talk about the impact of the ending of this book on me. The entire novel is a page turner until the very end, but when I got the the second-to-last page I couldn't move. I was in complete and total shock; tears were rolling down my cheek and I didn't even realize it at first. And then after taking easily five or ten minutes to absorb the ending, I immediately got on the phone to tell my family to read Atonement. Rarely if ever has another book had an impact on me like that before. In the space of two days - which is how long it took me to read this - Atonement became one of my top five books of all time, and Ian McEwan, who I'd never really heard of previously, one of my favorite authors. If you haven't seen the movie yet, even though that's excellent as well (heck, I've already seen it three times in the theater), I urge you to read the book first so that you can experience the ending the way it's meant to be experienced.
0891419195|5.0|An amazing view of the war in the Pacific. It's horrific, not in the language but in the details of life on the front line. Digging a fox hole though a battlefield graveyard, yuck!<br /><br />And I'm currently reading \\"Ship of Ghosts, The Story of the USS Houston, FDR's Legendary Lost Cruiser, and the Epic Saga of her Survivors\\" and in that book the Admiral complains that the men have been driven to their limits by a 21 hr on watch detail with only coffee and ham sandwichs for meals! The marines of the 5th would have killed for a ham sandwich and stone cold coffee! Weeks in the mud & rain, not a measly 21 hrs on watch! I guess it's all based on your perspective, still though they come off sounding like whiners.<br /><br />Another good reason to read this book is as an uplifting perspective on your own life. How good you really have it, even living under a bridge in a cardboard box would be better than the hell holes those fox holes were.<br /><br />What also comes through loud and clear is that while there is no pity for the soldiers he kills, there is respect. And in someways this is an anti war book. No one dies in glory for their country in this story. And with the ratio of deaths of the Japanese vs the Americans, it's amazing that they held on to the last man.<br /><br />The other clear message, is that this war was won by killing the enemy one at a time. Yeah occasionally they shelled some group of soldiers but most of them died with a last single bullet finding it's mark. What a dirty business.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|The Michael Moore movie Sicko may not be for everyone. But for those of us that appreciate a good documentary and are of liberal minds, this is an excellent film. This was purchased to be given as a gift. The person receiving it was extremely pleased.<br />There are parts of this movie that are to be taken with a grain of salt. But for the most part, Michael Moore gives you something to think about. There are alternate ways of providing healthcare for people of the U.S.
B00027JYLC|5.0|Freaks is a terrific thriller and a true classic in every sense of the word. It was too bad that they had to eliminate 30 minutes of the original movie before it was released. This is a must-see and I enjoy it more every time I watch it. Behold the wrath of the mighty midget!!!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This movie is much better than I ever anticipated, even with my high expectations. The scope of the higher budget than a regular episode is clearly visible.    Everyone shoud do as I do, and buy a DVD, in order to prove to everyone in the business that Stargate SG-1 isn't dead. The series must go on, in any form possible.
B00122O34O|1.0|holy jesus. i loved this movie but the soundtrack blows huge chunks. i hated every song that came on and i almost started laughing because it was so dreadful.   great movie though.

B000SFJWLU|2.0|Alright im not one to be negative on a website to review a CD, but I feel its necessary given all the hype behind this CD.  I feel if i dont some poor kid will buy this thinking its something its not.  Point blank, you want this CD, please listen first, i dont know where this site gets off saying if you like this you will like devildriver, static -x, divine heresy, throwdown, and everything else, not to mention the tag says thrash, heavy metal.  Plain and simple its Nu Metal we've all heard it a thousand times back in the ninties, and what makes it worse this album has been put out at least two other times, Motograter, Ghost Machine, although ill be th first to say yeah Ghost machine was definitely more unique, same damn formula packaged under a different band name.  Honostly i loved it when this cd came out the first time with Motograter, and ill admit this album isnt the worst either, however if your gonna sell a turd, make sure there is a big ole label on the front that says turd.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|In some respects, Danny Boyle is Britain's answer to Steven Soderbergh - a filmmaker who moves effortlessly from independent to studio films and works in a variety of genres: gritty drug drama ([[ASIN:B0001XALTG Trainspotting - Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)]]), kids film ([[ASIN:B000AP04GK Millions]]) and edgy horror ([[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]]). Like Soderbergh's [[ASIN:B00009ATIX Solaris]], Boyle has tried his hand at science fiction with Sunshine. It was critically lauded in England as a thinking person's genre film but was met with mixed critical reaction in North America and lackluster box office.<br /><br />Sunshine starts of as an intellectual science fiction film a la [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and then shifts focus to an engrossing mystery involving the Icarus I and shifts again to a slasher film reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000E1NXAY Event Horizon (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]] for the last third. This last shift has drawn the most criticism from reviewers and does test the film's credibility. Do the filmmakers really need to add even more danger for the protagonists to face? Isn't the fact that they are heading straight towards the Sun with limited resources and crew challenging enough?<br /><br />This is also a visually impressive film as Boyle not only shows off the usual iconography of the genre - spacecraft, spacesuits, etc. - but doesn't fall into some of the more tired clich&eacute;s, like aerodynamically-designed spacecraft and evil computers. He also doesn't telegraph who lives and who dies which gives the film an edgy unpredictability. At times, it feels like Sunshine wants to be the 2001 for the new Millennium but then the slasher film elements creep in and it resembles a more traditional thriller. It's too bad because up to that point, Boyle's film is a very smart, thought-provoking piece of speculative fiction.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Danny Boyle. He starts off by telling the genesis of the film. He also talks about how he got the actors to react convincingly to CGI effects that, of course, were not present on the set during filming. Boyle talks about the contrasting colour schemes of the inside and outside of the ship. Boyle speaks passionately about his film and packs this track with tons of information and observations.<br /><br />Also included is an additional commentary by Dr. Brian Cox from the University of Manchester, who was a scientific consultant on the film. He talks about how he got involved and how the filmmakers wanted to get away from the typical scientist stereotype. Cox talks about the plausibility of the film's premise and the psychology of people in long-term spaceflight on this very informative track.<br /><br />There are 11 deleted scenes and an alternate ending with optional commentary by Boyle. There is lots of little business by crew members doing tasks around the ship. Boyle talks about what he likes about this footage and why it was ultimately cut.<br /><br />Also included are 13 Web Production Diaries that are brief and cover all kinds of aspects of the film, from space suits to VFX. The cast and crew gush about working with Boyle in slightly tongue-in-cheek fashion, at first, and then speak genuinely admiringly about him. We see the cast experience zero gravity. Cillian Murphy talks about his character and some of the research he did for the role.<br /><br />Finally, there is a theatrical trailer for the film.telling the genesis of the film.

B0007XT87G|4.0|I'm a new fan to Porcupine Tree, my only exposure has been Arriving Somewhere... their live DVD. (Which on a side not is mind blowing.) I would really suggest you go on youtube or another site and listen to their more popular songs, such as Open Car, Shesmovedon, Trains, Blackest Eyes, and Lazarus. Listen to those songs (or whatever you find your favorites are) a lot, and get a feel for a band. Realize that this is a different band than you are probaly used to. They have parts that aren't always melodic or catchy, and if you need music that his always entertaining, I'd stick with the songs I listed above. However, if like me, you find the stuff they put in between the main parts of the song really cool, then I would start out with this CD. Deadwing is a really good song, buy you could never imagine it on the radio, however the next song Shallow, sounds like a perfect radio song.   Porcupine Tree, in my opinon are great, because they can be radio friendly, but the bands that are always radio friendly are seldom are rarely good for an album. I personally like listening to albums more than just singles, and Porcupine Tree has some awesome ones Go for Deadwing first, see how you feel about all this ambient and progressive stuff, and then consider another purchase (In Absentia my personal preferance).  I would also reccomend buying the bonus track version, Shesmoved on is an amazing song.  The only problem I really have with this album is the metal-like riffs, not to crazy about them, but it won't stop me from enjoying their music.
0553573411|1.0|I picked this up hoping to see the main character, Fitz, grow more interesting.  At least one might hope that the main character would stop wallowing in self pity and actually DO SOMETHING.  Instead the author maintains her interest in having her protagonist be railroaded by contrived circumstances and then complain about them for over six hundred pages.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|Let's face it. I kept telling myself that this album is great, all 10 tracks (that in itself is scraping the barrell, only releasing 10 tracks, when they cancelled their UK tour recently to continue their creative writing drive, you would expect much more than that). But on closer listening, it turns out that Avenged have fooled us all. The last 2 tracks have trumpets and country music - not something a self professed savior of metal should be doing. In fact, I can't remember ANY metal or heavy rock band using ANYthing other than guitar, bass, drums and vocals.  I will still support A7X, but I'm going to have to really turn a blind eye on these \\"progressive\\" tunes.
B000000WFZ|5.0|One of the great movie soundtracks of all time.  Big, stirring, complex, and soulful.    Just buy this.  You wont be sorry.
0375847227|4.0|First off, as a Christian I too am concerned about Christians who deplore this trilogy and the first film without ever reading it, and warning all to avoid simply because it is anti-church.  I disagree with them on these matters.<br /><br />It is well done fantasy writing, especially the first book.  For this reviewer it truly lost its collective steam in the third and final book.  The author there chooses to openly, without any literary or fantasy devices to attack his views of Christianity.  This is mentioned not just to my own personal bias on theology, but just from a literary point.  C.S. Lewis does no such thing.  It also is so weak in its portrayal of God as ancient of days being carried around on litter with psalms being sung, and only such a brief appearance and then gone.  It also left me lacking in its ending, with going back to separate universes to live lives with no real meaning, other than glorification of matter which is eternal and nothing else.  That seems to be Pullman's worldview, which if so, not sure many others of us truly want to buy into.  This ending coldness should be wake up call for many.<br /><br />Not sure at all what level a child could and should be reading this.  Found that some young teenagers cannot engage with Narnia books, so not sure they would with this, but will leave that up to experts, children themselves and their parents.  They too will have to make decisions about  allowing children to read this series.  Not up until the final work is there disputable things.<br /><br />Tony Watkins has provided wonderful resource (his book:Shedding Light on Philip Pullman's Trilogy) for the interested delving into possible motivators for Pullman's thrust, i.e. as his own father being taken at early age, interest in parallel universes, literary influences, etc. By the way, Tony is a fan of reading this trilogy!  His website is also good and balanced perspective on such: Damaris Trust.  Also, some might want to check out the interview with Tony on Issues, Etc.'s website, searching their archives for such.<br /><br />Informed readers will also see that Pullman adds material to his quote from Genesis 3, as well as takes liberties with describing Christian faith in way that most Christians will not relate to, i.e. that church wants to control all behavior, rather than followers of Christ.<br /><br />Interesting to see if this film series will continue, given the poor showing thus far of The Golden Compass.  Compare this with excitement over upcoming Prince Caspian release.'s website, searching their archives for such.    Informed readers will also see that Pullman adds material to his quote from Genesis 3, as well as takes liberties with describing Christian faith in way that most Christians will not relate to, i.e. that church wants to control all behavior, rather than followers of Christ.

0767020308|4.0|I really enjoyed this version, there were just a few annoying things.  The dreams or whatever they were Emma was having. Strange.  As others have said Mark Strongs anger was a little over the top. Whoa settle down about the haircut already! He just never seemed like the Mr. Knightly in the book. And Kate Beckinsale's Emma borders on wickedness.No compassion there. I still really enjoy it - Jane Austen wrote a great story with Emma.
B000YPUFA6|3.0|The quality of this Blu Ray is acceptable in most scenes. I'd give it 4 (just!) out of 5 for that. However, the story is weird and borrows a lot of ideas that I have seen or read in other science fiction, fantasy and horror movies or books. There's nothing that new about it, the zombie attack scenes are quite boring and two characters have psionic powers! Hmmm!? The gore level is quite low too. Zombies tear people apart - these zombies wiggle their heads over people pretending to bite - it looks like a pantomime at times LOL!<br /><br />I felt that it was a blend of Mad Max (surviving the wastelands and finding fuel), Alfred Hitchcock (our feathered friends), Fantastic Four (lets give them special powers so it's easier to write future scripts), Doom (the computer game that is, for bodies skewered on poles \\"Attila the Hun\\" style and hanging from ceilings) and Ultraviolet (check out the excessive face foundation on Milla Jovovich - what's that all about?).<br /><br />It's worth adding to your collection, when it gets cheaper, but it's not going to blow you away. This is short term candy borrowing \\"trusted\\" ideas and concepts to earn a modest living. There's no innovation. A classic movie built for marketing rather than story.
B000SZZIH2|1.0|Pet Sounds is OK.  Not close to being the greatest album at all.  The only really good songs are Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows and Sloop John B.  I do not see the impact nor the hysteria that some Beach Boy fans see in this album.  A lot of the other songs seem to be a throw together of random melodies and dreary rhythmic structures.  If one continues to compare the Beach Boys to the Beatles, stop it... There is no comparison; Lennon and McCartney still rule in the composition arena of popular music.     Carlos
B000VBP38C|1.0|This movie was raved by so many critics that I am at a loss as to what they see in it. The movie works only if the viewer knows nothing about Jane Austen, has never seen the BBC classicc (I highly, highly, recommend this), and likes Keira Knightley. She's not an awful actress, but she is so entirely wrong for Elizabeth Bennet that I cringed through the entire movie. Her Oscar nod in unexplainable
1905236042|5.0|We are still trying to fit a set time for this yoga with our crazy schedules, but we have already worked on it some and my husband and I and our two girls one five and the other three all love it.

B000002LTU|2.0|Seems like Miles was reaching a bit on this one, and he should never have hooked up with this lame rapper (Easy Mo Be or some such); you'd think if he was gonna do this thing, he'd have found a unique rapper or one with a style that was less inane and brown-nosing to collaborate with. But a big part of it is probably that Miles died before the thing was even halfway finished, and this assclown got put in charge of the final mix and track selection, at which he is hopeless. And what the %$#*^% is with that title? When you mix Hip Hop with Be Bop, you get Be Hop or Hip Bop; seems Easy Mo Beeyotch got confused with Doo Wop. Sheesh.<br /><br />There's some mildly pleasant mixes with a good trumpet and some punchy backing tracks, but they're usually the ones with little vocalizing; when B steps in, it slides hard.
B00003CXC6|5.0|\\"Rashomon\\" is one of the great movies for the ages.  It challenges us to think about what \\"reality\\" might be, and leads us to wonder if we can truly comprehend \\"reality.\\"<br /><br />Let me begin this review with a fragment about postmodern perspectives.  One key point here is that subject and object cannot be separated.  We cannot \\"get outside\\" ourselves in order to objectively observe the world around us--including the world of human affairs. This is oversimplified, of course, but it provides one lens through which to consider Akira Kurosawa's great work, \\"Rashomon.\\"<br /><br />This 1950 film, starring Toshiro Mifune as a bandit, is based on what seems to be a straightforward event. A samurai is killed and his wife raped. The movie starts with three people seeking refuge from a heavy rain under a decayed gate in 12th century Japan.  The three: a woodcutter, a priest, and a peasant.  They begin talking about the incident just noted.<br /><br />Then, we see the murder and rape through the eyes of the three people involved--the samurai, his wife, and the bandit.  And each version (the dead samurai's version is provided through a medium) differs remarkably from the other two.  In short, we have three eyewitnesses telling of a fundamentally different event.  So, what is reality?  That is the question at stake.  And, to make matters even murkier, the woodcutter finally mentions that he had observed the whole scene himself--and his view was different still!  Thus, four very distinct interpretations of a single event.  The woodcutter's version might seem most plausible, but then he trips himself up by revealing something that raises questions about his motives.<br /><br />Why speak of a postmodern perspective earlier in this review?  Because postmodernists argue that it is difficult for people to step outside themselves and  their unique perspectives and biases to observe \\"objective reality.\\" And contemporary psychologists tell us the same: humans are remarkably able to distort reality to protect self-image and make their motives appear to be good (and competitors' to be not so good).  In that sense, there is a great deal of human nature, psychology, and philosophy at stake in this movie.<br /><br />Things sound pretty bleak, but the movie closes with an event that actually provides some hope that humans can produce value and make positive things happen.<br /><br />All in all, a wonderful movie.  Effects are pretty simple (the budget was unbelievably small).  In the end, though, this is a movie well worth viewing, in large part because of the difficult questions that it raises.stort reality to protect self-image and make their motives appear to be good (and competitors' to be not so good).

0525950079|5.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth (read it twice) and I loved this book just as much.  While it is true that this book follows the same formula as Pillars and can be predictable at times, I couldn't put this page turner down.  I was a little stressed out that the library only gave me 2 weeks to read 1014 pages, but I finished it in 5 days (while neglecting the house and my kids). I'm a big reader and no sooner do I put one book down do I pick up another.  It is a rare book that can hold my interest so strongly.  The intertwined lives of all the characters and the way the story is woven together throughout the decades is amazing.  I looked up black death online and learned a little more about it which mad this book even more interesting.  Follett did an expert job of weaving in the history leading up to and following the plague.  Even though this book was sort of a repeat of Pillars, it still deseves 5 stars.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Thank you, Ridley Scott and everyone else involved with the creation of this DVD set.  Amazing.
B000XA5K48|1.0|This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever thrown in my DVD player.  Bottom line.  It lasted only about 30 minutes before I shut it off.  Thank goodness I only rented it and didn't buy it.  It's a stupid, tasteless, boring, annoying, trashy shoot 'em up flick.  I gave it one star, because I had to.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|I always did like Zeppelin. I grew up with them,but it was hard getting some of the songs after my vinyls wore out. Now most of them are here. It was really nice to show them live in their day when everyone enjoyed seeing and hearing them. My hat is off to Atlantic Records for putting this gem together
B000VWMUMS|5.0|This is a concert with Eric Clapton on lead guitar, with Pete Townsend (of the Who) and Ronnie Wood (of the Stones and Faces) backing him up. They play at near top-form. That should be enough for you to want to get this Right Now! If it isn't, you need to go to the ear doctor and get your hearing examined. (Though it may be tempting to blast this loud enough to need your hearing examined later on!)
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I can hardly believe Amazon's review and customers review of this movie. While the casting of characters like Elizabeth and Mrs.Bennett was exquisite, it is contrasted poorly by pitiful casting, for example, Pike as Jane.    The thing with novel adaptations is that character's image will be different from one reader to the next so no movie will ever satisfy, in the regard, every audience member. But the characteristic is unquestionable and so is the mood of each scene. The director poorly captured certain mood and disposition of minor characters such as Mr.Bennett and Jane.     I give up. Forget expalining every minute detail on how the director butchered a masterpiece. Everybody please, stop watching movies....
B000UBMSB8|4.0|The great thing about this DVD set is that it contains the original theatrical release!  This one disk is the earliest and best version of the story about the future detective tasked with running down a band of renegade replicants.  The replicants are purpose-built beings, almost human and in some respects super-human, and tracking them down raises questions about the nature of humanity and the self.  The bad thing about the product is that in order to get the real Blade Runner one must also get the disks for the re-edits, which all have unsatisfying endings that go against the grain of the basic story.  The reason for the peculiar history of Blade Runner DVD's is that the director and producer grossly overextended their budget and went bankrupt.  The completion company took over the mess, completed the film, and released it theatrically.  The film became a classic, but the original creators were miffed because the released film did not quite match their original vision (it was actually better, but they did not see that).  What ensued was a protracted fight about ownership rights.  The original director later produced and released significantly re-edited versions on DVD.  Because of long-lasting fights about ownership rights, the original theatrical release has been previously unavailable on DVD.
B000TLTVRS|5.0|This is for certain the most unique and refreshing film I can recall in quite some time.  Initially a 19th century urban legend, the story has been applied time and time again in different mediums, including of course the hit [[ASIN:B000CRR3P6 Broadway musical]].  There was a commendable recent film adaptation made for television of the story with Ben Kingsley starring in the title role as well.  Tim Burton's version titled Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is a direct adaptation of the musical and stars long time Tim Burton collaborator Johnny Depp as the legendary anti-hero.  It also stars Tim Burton's real life girlfriend Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett.  The supporting cast is absolutely outstanding with Alan Rickman playing the film's horrible antagonist Judge Turpin and Timothy Spall playing his toady.  Sacha Baron Cohen ([[ASIN:B000MMMT9G Borat]]) is a hilarious stand-out as one of Todd's early rivals in the film.  Newer names to look out for in the cast include Jamie Campbell Bower, Jayne Wisener, and especially Edward Sanders.<br /><br />Suffice to say, there is much to reveal in this film and so much is better left unsaid for the sake of surprise, especially for those not familiar with the story.  It's a gutsy production for two reasons.  First, it's a musical and second, more throats are slit in this film than any I can recall.  Those two facts really seem to narrow the gap in terms of audience appeal.  On one hand, it might be fair to assume that the demographic marching like zombies to see shallow gorno like the Saw movies would, for most part, not be the least bit interested in seeing a musical.  In fact, I went to see this film with my police officer friend who wanted to see the new [[ASIN:B001451HX4 alien vs. predator]] movie, what a shame it was sold out as that may have been a far less challenging review to write.  On the other side of that coin, the people who may typically be drawn to a musical may find the violence a bit off putting.  I was surprised first to see that the film was a musical (shame on me that I didn't even know) and next that the film was a heavy R-rating due to excessive throat slitting or as they say in the marketing initiatives for some films today, pervasive sequences of violent bloody gore and constant maiming.  The music actually adds well to the expressions of the characters and is used as a tremendous advantage while the blood, albeit certainly less important, serves to make the film visually shocking and surreal.  Nevertheless, the two worlds come together and click together.  However, it is a fantastic film for many reasons far beyond its generally unique existence.<br /><br />Firstly, Depp and Carter are both incredible and deserving of their recent Golden Globe nominations (the film has four in all including also Best Picture for a Musical/Comedy and Tim Burton for direction).  Many will say it is just Depp's time to win an Oscar and I would imagine he will be nominated for that as well and he may even win, but it won't be because of his lack of the award despite a consistently engaging and unique career.  In other words, this isn't Depp's [[ASIN:0783226845 Scent of a Woman]]. His turn as Sweeny Todd is absolutely his very best performance.  His facials expressions are mean but inviting and he helps to make you sympathize with his character despite the horrible acts of brutality he commits.  Todd is played as if his one and only goal is revenge.  He also sings surprisingly well. He is like a crooner with an attitude.  And to think that Carter almost upstages him as Mrs. Lovett, seemingly an equally wrought character who finds love in the eyes of a man driven by bloodlust alone.<br /><br />However, Tim Burton's direction is the train and the cast is just along for the ride.  Depp and Carter's performances are fueled in part by the depth to which they understand or trust Tim Burton's robust imagination and actually try to exist within his demonic and stunning vision of London.  The scenes that rain blood during happy songs gave me this unique sort of feeling of fear, disgust, and satisfaction that Todd was able to finally release his welled-up anger or that Mrs. Lovett was able to finally make a decent meat pie.  All I could do was muster up a nervous laugh and think a little bit about what I was actually watching.  I will say with definite certainty that Burton had an immense passion for this story and to tell it on his terms.  He has only strayed from that perspective a few times in his career and it is nice to see him do work like this.  Burton is shaping up to be one of the greatest directors of our time and in my view among his many films, Sweeny Todd is the tallest tree in a forest of trees taller than most.<br /><br />I found great pleasure in watching this movie.  It is relieving to see a film that cost $50 Million be so uniquely twisted and surreal.  It is a risk and I hope it pays off so we can see something as equally beautiful and experimental get the resources and care behind it again.  If there is a flaw here it is the same flaw that exists in all of Burton's movies.  He always prioritizes style over substance.  This is a visual movie first and foremost but it isn't by coincidence that the film also has heart.he scenes that rain blood during happy songs gave me this unique sort of feeling of fear, disgust, and satisfaction that Todd was able to finally release his welled-up anger or that Mrs. Lovett was able to finally make a decent meat pie.

0810993139|3.0|This book, \\"A Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\", was okay.    The humor, though nonetheless funny, is not that appealing, and somewhat crude and mean. I don't think that this book was sending out a very good message, and I actually think adults would \\"get\\" the humor more.     Another thing I disliked was that it was totally off on what middle schoolers are like. The kids these days are actually more mature than what the book is making them out to be. Instead of hating each other, there's more going out and liking each other in real life between girls and boys. Instead of having so many elective choices and safety patrols, we have one elective in real life.     However, it was funny and parts of it you just had to laugh out loud!    FOR PARENTS: (Scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest\worse)  bad language - 0 there was no bad language  sexual content - 2  1. one example of sexual content is that the main character's little brother takes a magazine with a girl in a bikini on the hood of a car in it to school.  2. another example of sexual content is that one boy says he kissed a girl's friend behind the lockers.  violence - 5  1. one example of violence was that the main character, Greg, and his friend Rowley play violent video games.  2. another example of violence is that Greg and Rowley try to make a HUGE snowball and roll sledders in it.  3. There are several references of bullying.  4. The school has a wresting class and Greg gets a benchpress for Christmas.  5. Many throw apples at a girl and break her glasses.  adult content - 5  1. one example of adult content is that there are mentions of kids smoking and the are drawings of smokers.  2. another example of adult content is that high schoolers toliet paper a house and make Greg and Rowley eat year-old cheese on the basketball courts.  3. There is no cussing in the book, but it does say that the kids make a list of cuss words.  4. Greg hints that church could be more interesting and that a \\"Bless This House\\" sign would not be an ideal gift, which may come off offensive or confusing.  5. Greg listens to his older brother's rock music with a \\"parental advisory\\" sticker on it.    Overall, this was an okay book.
B000OLX4SU|4.0|The previous review says it all.  \\"Frankenstein\\", however, is the name of the scientist (Victor Frankenstein) who created the monster, not the name of the monster himself.  The monster is nameless.
B0000024T3|4.0|This is possibly Barbra Streisand's first experimental recording, in which the songs recorded are sung in French and/or of French origin.  While it was not an experiment that paid off initially (Barbra even joked on her latest tour that it only went gold about 40 years later), the end result is a beautifully sung album.    Almost all of the songs are sung with a great passion, that makes even those of us ignorant of the French language truly feel what is being said.  This is especially true on \\"Ma Première Chanson\\" (notable for being her first songwriting venture), a swinging version of \\"What Now My Love,\\" and \\"Clopin Clopant,\\" where her enunciation of the syllables alone can make your hair stand up.      Admittedly, this album will need time to grow on you.  It isn't a Barbra Streisand essential by any means, but any fan will appreciate her beautiful voice and phrasing.  All fans will want this.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|Great old movie. Received quick & no problems with CD. Highly recommended for your collection.
B000TXG3YA|5.0|I bought Baroness' Second album and was so impressed that I was looking forward to their next effort, The Red Album.  If you like the fierceness of Mastodon and the drone of Isis, then you will completely love this record.  It creeps into my head all the time.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes stoner rock.  Two thumbs up!! Way up!!
B000000OQF|5.0|They took the best elements of 70's hard rock and made it harder, all the while keeping melody and sophisticated elements intact. Even if you're not a fan of Axl's voice (it will grow on you, if you give it a chance), the music is so compelling that you can't help but enjoy it. From radio staples like Sweet Child O' Mine to the no-holds-barred testerone filled Welcome To The Jungle, there is something here for everyone (with the exception of a ballad - but this is a 100% hard rock album).    It's already been 20 years and this album remains one of the greats. Timeless indeed. It encapsulates all things rock - the music, the style, the women, the drugs, the crowds, the sex, the debauchery - it's all there in the lyrics, the tempo, and artwork on the album sleeve. This debut album put GnR on the map, and we're all the richer for it.
037582913X|5.0|This is a fantastic book, and my favorite as a child.  Its a great combination of humor and suspense followed by a happy ending.  Grover spends the entire book trying to protect the reader from the monster lurking at the end of the book.  He builds walls, etc and the reader just keeps on pushing... and of course, grover himself is the monster at the end.  You won't be disappointed, this book is fun for adults and kids!  (There's another version out there for \\"older\\" kids which is interactive, with wheels, things to pull and flip (all made of strong paper--nothing high-tech) which may make it even more fun for your child.)
B000TGJ80I|5.0|A fantastic movie, largely under appreciated, with a superb storyline and amazing action! Blu Ray transfer looks great and the PCM sound is likewise, especially if you have a good surround system to give it extra life. IF you like this movie, go ahead and buy Underworld: Evolution NOW as it's just as good and a worthy sequel to this flick. And by the way, with Warner Studios going over to Blu Ray exclusively, say GOODBYE to the inferior and now lifeless HD DVD format...finally. Anyone on the fence over the format war can now go ahead and get a Blu Ray player as the war is OVER!!
1596680296|5.0|I had never knit socks prior to opening this wonderful book.  It is clear, concise and easily understood.  I had always feared trying to knit socks because I did not understand how to turn the heel.  This book was so straight forward - turning turned out not to be any big deal!  Highly recommended.  I plan to buy Ann Budd's other books.
1401307787|5.0|This is the best self-help book I have ever read.  It is easy to read and provides clear and concise methods to gain the wisdom to cope with the stresses encountered in everyday life.  The author's language, writing skill and ability to provide examples in nature to explain Mindfulness are beautiful. Telling us to pay attention to our breath to keep our focus and get back on track he talks about sitting with dignity and paying attention to the things around us.  He gives many examples that include standing, walking, laying down, and doing everyday things while practicing for a minute to 45 minutes depending on our life circumstance at the time.  My favorite analogy is that of the mountain.  He state: \\"Mountains are quintessentially emblematic of abiding presence and stillness.\\" \\"By becoming a mountain in our meditation, we can link with its strength and stability, and adopt them for our own.  We can use its energies to support our efforts to encounter each moment with mindfulness, equanimity, and clarity.  It may help us to see that our thoughts and feelings, our preoccupations, our emotional storms and crises, even the things that happen to us are much like the weather on the mountain.  We tend to take it personally, but its strongest characteristic is impersonal.  The weather in our own lives is not to be ignored or denied.  It is to be encountered, honored, felt, known for what it is, and held in high awareness since it can kill us.  In holding it in this way, we come to know a deeper silence and stillness within the storms, mountains have this to teach us, and more if we can come to listen.\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is stressed, angry, and unable to escape or deal with their unpleasant environment.
0385522401|4.0|On Chesil Beach is McEwan's latest venture into fiction, and it is an extremely fine, though thin novel about a disastrous honeymoon between a young couple. McEwan's prose is undeniable elegant and provocative, perhaps even reminiscent of the stark and cold beauty of Andre Gide. However, the book's weakness is really that it is merely a short story in terms of scope. We are offered little in terms of the history of the characters and the world that they have come to occupy together. Most of the work is devoted to the creation of the subtle tensions and misunderstandings between the protagonists, which finally culminate in an excellent scene of abandonment and heartbreak. A fine work, though a bit superficial and obviously stretched thin.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is such a breath of fresh air from the typical Hollywood programmatic, canned theme style.  The reason it has gotten more interest lately is probably because it is easy to relate to.  This film is very simple and has no big budget sets or halos on the characters.  Sometimes you need to escape into fantasy and sometimes you need to see hope in the everyday challenge of living and being broken hearted.  This is the latter of those two.  A great film if you like seeing something real without the predictable bedroom scenes and dark alley stuff where the nice people get hurt.  Great music! A film with substance yet no pretense of depth.  If you hated the ending they added to the US version of the recent Pride & Prejudice, I predict you will really like this film.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Wasn't made on a big budget ,that's pretty obvious   But hell if you have an hour and a half to kill you could do a lot worse  With the rate of remakes being done now it won't take long to be re shot
B000VEA30W|4.0|i think it has more pop sound in it. i like the guitar in \\"city of evil\\" better. buy it if you like the way they play metal.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I saw another reviewer wonder why they got Sigourney Weaver to narrate the version we saw on TV (at least in America) -- I would trade in this Attenborough version for hers any day -- she speaks crisply and clearly, annunciating well. He is older and garbles his words as if he has food in his mouth, and with the British accent on top of that he is much more difficult for my children to understand. That is the only reason I don't give this one 4 stars. If you can get the Weaver version, I recommend doing that. Otherwise this is a WONDERFUL documentary that my whole family LOVES. So well put-together and such amazing cinematography. Just disappointed not to hear Sigourney's voice -- nothing against Attenborough, who is a pioneer of nature documentaries, he just doesn't have the voice anymore. :)
B000VDDDY6|4.0|As a fan of the Original Star Trek, I was very skeptical when I found out they were remastering the special effects. However, I thougt they should have restored the prints long ago, the episodes have been looking quite crappy for years, more than anything all scrached up, worn out. But \\"Leave the old visual photographic effects alone!\\" I thought, and guess what? They replaced them all with CGI. The big surprise is, they actually help the narrative. They don't always work, sometimes looking too cartoonish, but other times the effects are awesome, allowing the viewer to see what's going on outside the Enterprise in a way that has never been seen before(in the original show), and at the same time, they managed to keep it looking within the style of the old effects. And better yet, the show itself looks better than ever; vivid colors, great contrast and almost no more scratches. Plus, although few people know this, the real reason they upgraded the visual effects is because they wouldn't hold up in HD; you could already see wires holding the models on standard DVD definition. So give this one a chance, sit down and enjoy what was actually improved. And bring on Season 2!
0156030306|2.0|This book is not actually as bad as everyone say it is.  It's juts that SOOOOO many schools make this required reading, and only a small percentage of kids would actully find this book engaging.    The plot is pretty cool, it's a very interesting thought: what if an operation could make you a genius?  The format of the book; diary entries; is engaging also.  However, the book goes into too much detal about pointless things...and that's why so many people don't like this book.  It drags on and on, never getting very exciting.    I love to read.  I really do.  I just don't like being forced to read horribly boring books by my english teacher.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|thats what I was thinking when I first saw this CD and deciding whether to buy it or not. A cuban piano player and a gypsy flamenco singer NAAA I don't think it's gonna work,I bought it any way..... I was familar with most of the songs Inolvidable, Lagrimas Negras and had heard them done by other artists many times. but this combination works and what is created is a haunting beautiful version of a song that will change you forever because these are the versions of the songs that will stick in your mind forever and when you hear them again being done by other arists they will not have that special tragic magic that will haunt you forever..... No other version of Lagrimas Negras will ever be good enough to compare....curiosity almost  killed the cat but the magic in this CD will surely bring any cat back to life..
B00065MDSG|2.0|I really like King Crimson´s first two albums. And \\"Islands\\" is pretty good too. But this one is way too odd and freaked out, more like avantgarde. Not really my thing, I prefer KC when they´re a bit more melodic.  Let´s see how many \\"Not helpful\\"-votes this will get...
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I love the show.  I thought the Cirque du Soleil stuff was just over-hyped because I've never seen one.  Now that I have, and one based on this sound track...  I was wrong.  This show is quite an experience and this CD is a wonderful companion for those who have seen the show and absolutely love the Beatles.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|\\"North and South\\" : a BBC miniseries.  Magnificent.  Not what I first thought when I opened this gift for Christmas. Having never heard of the series, I raised an eyebrow at the handsome man on the cover and put it among my other gifts.   Tonight, my family and I watched the complete series without interruption. How else could we have watched it?!   After each of the hour long episodes, I was literally screaming in frustration/agony at the happenings in the episode.   Well-crafted with a deliciously dark reality concerning cotton-filled air of the Industrial Revolution's cotton factories in England and the cultural, occupational differences that can divide citizens even of the same country.  Certainly makes \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" seem a walk in the park, not to demean that wonderful series at all.  Character development: excellent. It was both terrifying and relieving to see what turns the plot took for the characters. The soundtrack added immensely to the series, the soaring theme in the background reinforcing the action on the screen. I'll be looking for that one to add to my collection.    Though it may seem that Miss Margaret and Mr. Thornton will never be together...the implications and growing romance (and outright refusal of such feelings) are tantalizing. The series keeps you  twisting in painful suspense up to the very end, which elicited applause and general joy from my family members watching.       Definitely, definitely will re-watch.
0767817664|4.0|Released in '85 `Fright Night' is a wonderfully campy, contemporary vampire tale that was one of the first films to bring the vampire mythos into contemporary times, preceding the classic `The Lost Boys' by two years. `Fright Night' is a bit uneven in the beginning but during the last thirty minutes or so the storyline really comes together and make it all worthwhile. Chris Sarandon makes a great vampire as is Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent, late night host of Fright Night, a weekly television show where he masquerades as a fearless vampire hunter.<br /><br />This one is lots of fun and stands up well to repeat viewings!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie was visually, musically, and emotionally beautiful! If you want to see a movie that will awe and inspire you, watch this movie!!! I love the Beatles and was somewhat skeptical on how it would have turned out, but this film definitely blew my mind. Ms. Wood made such a visually and funky historical twist on her part that the masterpiece of music that was added made the whole thing mesh in something I haven't experienced before. This movie also received good reviews from the 2 last living Beatles :D Hey I think it's worth a shot. I'm definitely owning this movie, but if you feel unsure about it, you can always rent :P At least make this movie worth your time, I promise you wont regret it.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I purchased this watch in November of 2007 and am extremely pleased! The quality is outstanding, and the value of this watch makes it a great purchase. The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was the amazing attention to detail Seiko executed in the design. It looks amazing and when I held it for the first time, I was very impressed with the weight. The bracelet is beautiful and there is a stark contrast between the mirror finish in the center of the links and the more subtle silver beside it.     The hardlex dial window magnifies the interior of the bezel, but also gives it a very nice depth. Everything about this watch looks amazing, and you can tell that the engineering is top notch. All of the text along the inside of the bezel is perfectly aligned, and even the slide rule moves around the perimeter with an expensive and slow paced friction.    I would recommend this watch to everyone. It looks like a watch that retails in the same tier as Rolex, Omega and Tag Heuer, but also functions in a way which justifies the price tag, and leaves you feeling satisfied.     I have had several people comment on the watch, saying things like, \\"that is a serious... watch\\" or \\"wow... nice watch!\\" My existence is not grounded in the material circumventing my wrist, but I do feel I should give you a fair and balanced review. I spent several weeks researching this watch and comparing it against Citizen, etc... but was extremely please in my final decision. I wanted an amazing watch that wouldn't cost me thousands of dollars that operates professionally and won't need a replacement for some time.    The warranty card that came with the watch wasn't filled out, so I am contacting the seller about that. I would also highly recommend buying a watch pin remover so that you can fit it to your wrist correctly, I purchased this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A7G45I which works like a charm, and is very easy to use.     The watch also came with several booklets with instructions that were very handy, detailing how to set the watch and use the slide rule.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Raw power from down under.  This album only gets better the more I listen.  Only thing better than turning this to #11 on the stereo is seeing them Live!  If you havent listened to these guys yet I recommend buying it now and seeing them when they tour next.  Best live band i have seen.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Discovering a David Cronenberg film can be touchy at best. He's one of those hit or miss directors ...or at least he has been. Swinging wildly between the obtuse and the flat-out bizarre, Cronenberg is a challenging film maker to say the least. From his pathetic beginnings as a short film maker to his wobbly movie length debut with STEREO (1969), Cronenberg's early repertoire is, shall we say, less than inspiring. But then he started having fun and came up with the head bursting [[ASIN:B00005K3NY Scanners]] (1981), which got a \\"cult\\" label quickly attached to it. Then came the creepy and highly successful [[ASIN:0783228457 Videodrome]] (1983) and -- my personal favorite -- [[ASIN:B000GBEWH0 The Dead Zone]] (1983) starring a very young Christopher Walken. Even his [[ASIN:B000MNOXZ8 The Fly]] remake was strange enough to entice most movie-goers. And who could forget [[ASIN:B0000CDUT5 Naked Lunch]] (`nough said).<br /><br />But then Cronenberg seemed to fall off his success ladder. The stale [[ASIN:B00000K31V eXistenZ]] and [[ASIN:B00000F4MA Spider]] were completely uninspired and rehashed old themes. His attempt at a romantic drama in M. BUTTERFLY quickly flittered away with little to no notice from critics or audiences.<br /><br />It appears, however, that Mr. Cronenberg is now back on track with a set of successful films under his belt. [[ASIN:B000CQLZ0Q A History of Violence]] (also starring Viggo Mortensen) was a strange beast but exceptionally well executed in 2005. And now with EASTERN PROMISES, Cronenberg has again hit pay-dirt.<br /><br />More of a crime-thriller, Eastern Promises has some great acting by almost the entire cast. Viggo Mortensen ([[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings]]) has been singled-out by a few award ceremonies and I find this a bit unfair. Naomi Watts ([[ASIN:B000NOIX48 The Painted Veil]]) does just as good a job as Viggo. Her portrayal of a pretty young London nurse trying to help an orphaned baby who's mother was killed by a Russian mob boss is excellent. And so was Vincent Cassel ([[ASIN:B000W1V5VU Ocean's Thirteen]]) as the drunken and pitiful Kirill, son of the Russian boss. There's no denying that Viggo's Nikolai is creepy, dangerous and carries a pitch-perfect Ural-Russian accent, but his portions didn't stand out for me anymore than the rest of the cast.<br /><br />The extra features on the DVD are exceptionally interesting, telling the story of how Viggo researched his role, and the importance that Russian criminals place on body art tattoos (something very prevalent in the film).<br /><br />Perhaps it's the pairing of Mortensen and Cronenberg that makes the movies. With two highly praised ones now locked in, this duo seems to know what makes a film fly. Let's hope Cronenberg realizes this and keeps on with his upward success.And so was Vincent Cassel ([[ASIN:B000W1V5VU Ocean's Thirteen]]) as the drunken and pitiful Kirill, son of the Russian boss.

0743486285|5.0|I am a big Nikki Sixx fan, and i loved the Motley Dirt bio. I really didn't think anything could top the amount of excess that was dumped into that book until i picked this one up. I like how this was actually a diary he kept of the year they recorded the Girl Girls Girls album. I also really enjoyed the side commentary from the Nikki and the people who shared that year of his life with him. It blew my mind because for every month of the dairy that i read i really did say to myself \\"how is this guy alive\\" funny enough he says it himself a few times a well. For the sadness of what was written about his life you could help but still have a few chuckle moments which helped the with the heavier parts. Really great read.
B000N3ST7K|5.0|Seriously could there be a better soundtrack to this movie? Yeah, I didn't think so because if you've seen the movie and liked the music then seriously what are you waiting for?
159102594X|4.0|This novel is filled with colorful characters, almost cartoonish at times, but that is fantasy. Sometimes I think the amount of characters and their detail was a bit much but it certainly sets up the beginning of a great trilogy. The narrative changed often and, at first, I disliked the method of combining a character's thoughts in italics when  the narrative was clearly the point of view of that same focal character. It made me think that italics could have been used throughout the whole chapter. This offended my sense of narrative \\"rules\\" but rules are meant to be broken. I'm an \\"eater\\" after all... just kidding you sicko. But, as I was reading the narrative from the character's viewpoint, it helped me gain a sense of that character more, and, in the case of the Northmen, a sense of comradery. The most relatable character for me was, sadly, Jezel but I think it's a tough job to gain sympathy for murderous people. Many of my favorite archetypes are in here with some innovative twists. If anything, I think the book was too long but, again, when you're setting up a trilogy you need to expand on a lot. Also, too many characters seemed to be primed for redemption. Sorry, I just don't buy into that for Glokta. It's dark and fun. A great first novel and I'll be picking up the 2nd book soon.
B000286RNY|5.0|This is a hilarious and heart-warming tale of a group of downtrodden kung fu brothers who find new life in the world of football (soccer). It features the dynamic and hugely entertaining Stephen Chow, a man who makes his comrades in Western success Jackie Chan and Jet Li pale in comparison. Where Li is wooden and dull and Chan tries far too hard, Chow has an indifference that is refreshing. In some ways similar to his later offering, \\"Kung Fu (Hustle),\\" although less dark and violent, this movie is suitable for the whole family, particularly when you factor in the poignant lesson of avoiding prejudice.<br />The action is over-the-top CGI magic and makes for many of the belly laughs, but the romantic subplot between Chow's dreamer and the ugly duckling bun maker is a sweet and unique concept. The mere fact that Chow creates a character that sees beauty beneath the scarred exterior of the skilled yet self-doubting street vendor is a testament to all that Hollywood fails to understand about their audience.<br />I could watch this movie over and over and always get a laugh, get a warm feeling in my heart, and get a thrill out of the effortless kung fu magic of the extraordinarily gifted Stephen Chow.
0743454537|5.0|This was the first Picoult novel I've read... and it was amazing. The characters are completely believable in their actions, and each chapter's first person narrative with all the different characters lets the reader really \\"feel\\" the character's emotions and motives. The tragic, surprise ending really makes this book a tearjerker. Throughout the story though, Jodi takes you on a roller-coaster ride and doesn't let go. Her ability to weave in controversial issues without over-kill is remarkable. I cannot recomend this book highly enough. My Sister's Keeper is a breath-taking read, and a book I will definately re-read soon!
B000XA5K48|4.0|SHOOT 'EM UP is well named: this is a whompingly good action movie that is as much parody of its genre as it is a good story. It never for a moment takes itself seriously and it is played by a strong cast of top-drawer actors having a terrific time. Writer/director Michael Davis has found his niche and let's hope there will be more dark comedies that are as much fun to watch as this one.<br /><br />The story is negligible: lone man Smith (Clive Owen at his best) observes a pregnant woman in chased distress, delivers her baby, then finishes off the huge gang of bad guys who are in pursuit, taking the newborn boy to transient safety. Smith finds a lactating prostitute Donna (beautiful Monica Bellucci), takes her from her business of kinky sex and makes her the baby's surrogate mother. A smarmy gangster Hertz (Paul Giamatti in another career forming role), connected to an illicit arms manufacturer Hammerson (Stephen McHattie), is in pursuit of both Smith and the baby for reasons that are finally disclosed: the baby is part of a ring of potential bone marrow donors for an important Senator.  The ending is, well, an ending.  But it is the getting there that is all the fun.<br /><br />The dialog is peppered with hilarious one-liners that have a real edge and the methods of the endless killings include several using the carrot  that Smith keeps at hand as a weapon.  The shootings are fast and impossible but actually hilarious in the choreography.  Clive Owen plays the role straight, with a real gift for humor as well as action.  Paul Giamatti is a sinister delight and able to match Owens one-liner for one-liner.  Monica Bellucci makes her impossible role credible and as always is gorgeous to look at! This is a fast paced, finely written and acted parody - definitely deserving of the comic book title! Grady Harp, January 08

B000YMBBH0|3.0|I ordered these for my husband for Christmas thinking that they were all HD/SD and could be played on a regular DVD player.  Only the last one is, though.  I thought that I had not read carefully enough and went back and checked but the description is actually very misleading...the info about the standard def movie being on side B is under a new header which makes it look like it applies to all three movies rather than just the last one.  Fortunately, we found a great deal on an HD DVD player (we were planning to buy one eventually) and it came today.  Now he can enjoy his gift...1 1/2 weeks later!  The price for the movies was excellent, though.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang...I never even heard of this movie until I watched it at a friends house. Goes to show this movie didn't get much publicity, which came as a shock to me after viewing the film because I thought it was brilliantly put together. \\"KKBB\\" comes from the screenwriter Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) as his directing debut.    First off, if you get offended by vulgarous language this film is not for you. If you can look past the F word being said after every other word than you'll enjoy it thoroughly!    \\"KKBB\\" is a dry humoristic murder mystery starring Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart, a New York petty thief who steals everything and in the midst of running away form a robbery gone awry he ends up auditioning for a part in a movie and later ends up in L.A. From there he is set up with Gay Perry, a gay private detective who is also a consultant for movies played by Val Kilmer, who helps him out in the tangled murder mystery. While in L.A. Harry runs into his long lost high school crush, Harmony Faith Lane, played by Michelle Monaghan who asks for help from Harry in solving the case that involves her kid sister because she thinks that he is really a private detective.     The combination of these three fascinating characters creates a dynamic, exhilarating and exciting presence that is sure to have your complete attention on the screen at all times trying to make sure not to miss a thing...believe me you don't want to miss anything. With the witty brilliant dialogue, unexpected surprises, and hot action it's sure to leave you pleased...well most of you.    Downey delivers in this film with excellency, proving to me that he is an under-rated actor not given enough credit for his ambiguous performance. The only thing I have against his character is how surprisingly amazing of a gunslinger he becomes at the end of the movie...but than again he is an \\"amazing magician\\".     Val Kilmer plays by far the coolest, yet meanest and most hardcore gay dude in this movie. His character is very blunt and straight forward...or in his case would you call it gay forward?    This movie receives 5/5 stars from me for it's creativity, originality and sense of humor. Here's a line from the movie that I enjoyed....    Gay Perry: Do me a favor, go look up the word idiot in the dictionary and tell me what you find.  Harry: Let me guess, a picture of me?  Gay Perry: No idiot! The definition for idiot because that's what you are!

0375836675|4.0|This is a book that challenges the reader to think about what s/he can do, not what others might or should do.<br /><br />Ed and his friends are drifting through life: accepting and existing  without questioning.  Suddenly a series of events happen which cause Ed to be more actively involved in his own life and, as a consequence of that involvement, to help others.<br /><br />Okay, elements are contrived, some readers will dislike the graphic language and the ending may jar.  But to focus solely on these aspects is to miss the underlying message: the power that we each have to make a difference.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story.  Markus Zusak is an accomplished writer who, in this book, has provided the reader with the means to think beyond 'what is' to 'what might be'  If only ..<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B00004VVNB|3.0|It's a shame Logan's Run was not polished for a dvd release, because it remains a fairly mediocre science fiction film. As another reviewer has noted, LR became immediately redundant with the release of Stars Wars just a year later, which made LR's cheesy effects and sluggish pace look like a made-for-tv flick. What gives LR its enduring power, though, is its committed performances, especially York and Agutter (even if Michael York, with his hopelessly plummy diction, remains one of my least favourite actors). The director gives us plenty to look at in terms of futuristic settings, but today the movie is a curio - like most futuristic sci-fi - and a bit of a chore to sit through. The picture quality is very flat and washed-out, and the soundtrack lacks depth and clarity; the extra features are also meagre (I turned off the commentary by York after 15 minutes because it was so dry and boring and I didn't want to sit through the pic again). In brief, an inessential buy.
B00005JPTI|2.0|They changed the entire thing! The ending was completely different, and Robert Neville (who by the way was supposed to be pale with blonde hair and blue eyes...?) didn't have a dog! The dog was only in the book for one chapter. You can't even tell that the creatures in the movie are vampires!! What's up with that??<br /><br />I went to see this movie with my boyfriend. He had never read the book, and he liked the movie. So I guess, for people who are too lazy to pick up a book and want instant gratification, you can sit and waste your time with this cheesy movie. Or you can read the book like it was supposed to happen. I swear, the producers of the movie must have read the back of the book and not even cracked it to see what it was about. What the hell?<br /><br />99% of this movie is different from the book, to the extent they change Neville's family's names so he has a daughter named Marley, and he proceeds to launch into a big unneccessary speech about Bob Marley and peace on Earth. he is supposed to be the last man on Earth! How can there be peace if it's only one guy?? Or maybe better phrased, how can there be war?<br /><br />The creatures are left to be guessed at. Are even they vampires? Nowhere do I see any blood-drinking, staking, or burning in sunlight which all appear in the novel. It absolutely disgusts me when movies are so completely different from books they are based on, and seemingly 'dumbed down' for the masses. A cure for cancer gone wrong...hmm, didn't seem that simple in the book. And what happened to his dead family? Oh and didn't the storyline only take place a few months after the extinction of all other humans? Not three years later? And -SPOILER- what's with the ending? Some crazy refugee camp? In the book the vamps started a new form of government! That was a cool twist and really made you think. The producers of this movie stripped I Am Legend of all its originality and made it into another cheap movie aimed at giving misunderstood goth kids something to talk about.<br /><br />A piece of advice: DON'T read the book AND see the movie. Do one or the other. (I suggest reading the book.)bout.    A piece of advice: DON'T read the book AND see the movie. Do one or the other. (I suggest reading the book.)
0143034901|5.0|The writing was extremely clever. There were lines that I wish I remember so I could use them. The storyline was intricately woven and suspenseful. As much as I wanted to savor the book and read slowly, I could not wait for the next page. I usually give my books away for others to read but this is a keeper.
0385522401|3.0|'On Chesil Beach' is a short story about one young couple's disastrous wedding night. It is the 1960s in England, and Edward and Florence have just tied the knot. In their honeymoon hotel room they're both nervous, but for very different reasons.<br /><br />I didn't find the story entirely believable, especially for the time period. I couldn't imagine a young couple not talking about any of these things, or even recognizing that there might be a problem! They also didn't seem to really know each other as intimately as a couple in such a situation should. I had a hard time sympathizing as I was kind of irritated with the absurd level of non-communication.
0525950079|4.0|Even though I recalled little of POTE (having read it years ago), I fondly remember it as one of the best books I ever read.  Thus, I approached WWE with some ambivalence.  WWE unfortunately did not live up to the majesty of POTE.  At times, I felt as though I was reading two books -- one about Merthin/Caris and the other about Ralph/Gwenda.  Other than the fact that Ralph and Merthin are related and Caris and Gwenda are friends, there is little overlap between their stories (the one significant exception is Philippa who provides a momentary crossover, but that doesn't happen until close to the end).  I was also waiting endlessly for the significance of the letter hidden in the woods.  I was quite disappointed to find it had little to do with the story and was just a plot device to rid Kingsbridge of Philemon.  I'm not even sure why it's in the book, let alone prominently highlighted in the blurb on the dust jacket.  Nevertheless, about half way through (yes, that's after page 500), I put aside my questions and read it for sheer entertainment value, which the book amply provides with all its twists and turns.  The characters were interesting -- I particularly liked Gwenda and Philippa and while Ralph was revolting, he was definitely exciting. Ralph's end was quite appropriate although I was hoping for a Cain/Abel type ending (i.e., Ralph would attack Caris and Merthin would kill Ralph) to bring the two storylines together.  This book won't make my top ten list, but any book that can keep me engaged for 1000 pages deserves 4 stars.
1594481717|5.0|This is one of those books that you want to refer back again and again.

B000XPZUEI|3.0|Movie is a classic.  Problem is, and I don't know if it's just this product or also applies to other variants, but here you have a black and white picture and white English subtitles, which are illegible more than half the time due to the background.  Had I not researched the film online and had a general idea of what was happening, I would have been utterly lost.  Of course, if you're fluent in Italian, then you'll just be annoyed by the presence of the subtitles.<br /><br />I have no idea if there are better versions out there, but this isn't it.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|This album is great...I bought it directly from Radiohead's website about a month ago and have listened to the entire album at least 15 times.  It is extra mellow and almost depressing except that it is so beautiful.  It's hard to stop listening to it.
B000Y179KO|1.0|Quite simply, one of the biggest money grabs in recorded music history.  I wish I had the 30 minutes of my life back that I spent in my buddy's car the other day as he flipped through this POS.  Just awful.

B00005JOFQ|4.0|I got my mom to watch this and even she was impressed, and she can be very critical, especially when it comes to movies.    The basic plot:-  Two men meet in the summer of 1963, when they are both employed to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain. There, they become friends - and, later on, lovers, even though both insist that they are not \\"queer\\" (gay). When their jobs come to an end, they go their separate ways, but neither are totally happy until, four year later, they meet up. Over the next 20 years, they meet up (once or twice a year). I won't give away any more...........    This movie has been referred to as a \\"gay cowboy movie\\", but, after watching it, I feel that it is SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT!! It is about love, it is about accepting who you are (including your sexuality), it is about being true to yourself because, if you aren't, you will always be miserable.    Just watch it.
0743487486|1.0|First of all, this book gives ideas that have absolutely no practical application.  For example, he suggests that ideally you should never praise your kids, because they should learn to feel proud of themselves, not rely on your pride.  Sure, they should feel proud of themselves, but aren't they more likely to just feel bad about themselves if they grow up with parents who refuse to hand out praise?<br /><br />More importantly to me, as a Christian parent, is the fact that he sites religion as one of the reasons parents these days are too conditional in his opinion.  He actually states that the God of Christian and Jewish religion is the ultimate example of conditional love, and goes on to say that these religions teach God loves you only if you love him.  I can't respect anything he has to say after reading that kind of nonsense.
B000EXZI1O|4.0|This is the band's most successful album of their \\"disco\\" era, and with good reason. Behind the oft-mocked falsetto singing is some of the most competent songwriting and musicianship of the entire 70's period. If there ever really was a \\"Bee Gees sound,\\" this is the album that defined it.     If there's one real criticism, it's that you only get a rest from the falsettoes twice, and a brief one at that. Furthermore, \\"Living Together\\" should convince even the most ardent Robin Gibb fan that he should never be allowed to do the falsetto voice ever again, especially without Barry behind it.    But that is a minor problem with what is otherwise a prime example of the Bee Gees at the top of their game.
B0000AUHPK|1.0|This movie made me feel dirty and nauseated. On the bright side it's inspired me to read the book in an attempt to replace the vile characters presented in the movie with something, anything, else. Blech.

B000YPUF9W|2.0|Hi. I've just watched the Resident Evil - Extinction. And I'll like to make a few comments [please forgive my poor english and gramme mistake].    Where is Alice's character? Alice seen to be getting more gutless. She point a gun everywhere she goes in the gas station. Remember how Alice used to be in Apocalypse - steady, calm and cool.    What has Alice become \\" a human being with supernature power. Moving stones and motorbike into the air. Burning microchip in Satetile?\\" Alice becomes X-MEN after the escape in Apocalypse.    Why is there so many supporting actors and actress. Milla looks like leading supporting actress rather than playing the leading role in the movie.    The mansion in resident evil - death is no escape is above ground. Now they buried it deep underground. For what? Cut and paste to make the movie lengthy and fighting scene for Alice and Dr Sam Issac?    And where is Jill Valentine and Angie Ashford. MIA (Missing In Action). No telling whether they are - dead or alive or hiding in Alsaka.    Injecting T-virus + antivirus make you human and you do it couple of times you becomes monster that heals instantly. You bet Dr. Sam Isaacs will reanimate and come back alive in next resident evil.    If you wants to see Milla Jovovich in actions get Resident Evil - Apocalypse and Resident Evil - Death is no escape and UltraViolet \\"Director Cut\\" (I'm still waiting.)    5 Stars for Milla Jovovich and 2 stars for the plot.
0876852630|3.0|The book as a whole is a work of garbage unfortunatly. The story is very repetitive and litearly you can read the first quarter and wrap it around its self 4 times and you would not miss much of the book (great for last second high school book reports maybe, you only have to read a quarter of it). All of this and the toilet humor of being plastered drunk and partaking in frequent orgies would make this book a true one star, so why give it three? The answer is that it does have some gratifying humor from time to time, and despite the fact he cant keep his jobs his attitude at work and how he reflects it onto people before being fired has its own humorous merit. It does give you a little insight to the psychology of a problematic drunk, and it is plausible to the point of being probably accurate. these pieces make the book flow, and it is not really a difficult read. If a person wanted a book who does not read a lot and rarely has time to read except in short bursts, I guess the book is perfect. It repitition makes it easy to remember where you left off, and you can get as much plot from a quick 2 page read than a sitdown reading the whole novel. All in all its not a bad novel, but its not a good one either, but it is semi intersting.... definatly not a 5 star read though, those going in with high expectations are bound to be dissapointed.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|I haven't bought this set yet, so maybe I shouldn't be talking, but I have seen the entire series. I love this series for everything except the fact that it didn't last longer.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|I've been a fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers for a long time and I have to say that I was disappointed with this album. The Red Hot Chili Peppers has always been a band that has evolved but I don't really like this latest direction. When I was listening, I felt like they were watered down - neither as melodic as By The Way, as funky as Blood Sugar Sex Magic, nor as good as any of the albums in between. I would rate this album above Freaky Styley and Uplift Mofo Party Plan, just because their original albums are very unpolished and inconsistent in their quality. There are a few tracks on Stadium I like, but none of them make it into my favorites from this band. With many of the tracks, there were parts I could really get into and then they would fall short. For example, the song Snow (Hey Oh) starts out great but the chorus feels like a cop out - \\"Hey Oh, Listen What I Say-Oh\\". I'm not impressed. There were a lot of similar drawn-out \\"yeahs\\" and \\"ohs\\" on this album which felt like filler. When Kiedis had nothing worthwhile to sing, he should have just shut up and let his fantastic band shine. In addition, the melody of the vocals was often flat and boring - relying completely on the instrumentals for the musicality. Speaking of instrumentals, the most impressive thing on this album was the guitar. What happened to Flea? He comes alive in a few places only to revert back to generic bass lines.    I still gave this a three because it's not horrible, just not up to the caliber of their previous work. The Red Hot Chili Peppers is a great band and their poor efforts still outdo a lot of what's out there. I whole-heartedly agree that this would have been a lot better if they stuck to a single disc. From the reviews it seems that a lot of the acclaim for this album is coming from people who didn't really like the Red Hot Chili Peppers' prior work. It's great that they're reaching out to a broader audience and they are undeniably talented (and great live). To each their own,I just hope that this newest style is not a permanent one.
0783225849|5.0|Made with a paltry 1960 budget of 1 million and his TV show crew, Hitchcock shows independent filmgoers how to scare people and get great performances. Again, as in all his work, Hitchcock brings together wonderful set designers and locates the perfect locales.  He shoots most of it on a sound stage, but you'd never know it. The Bates Motel is really the first slasher movie set and Janet Leigh, a good-girl-bad-girl, is carved by wild-eyed Tony Perkins.     We feel sorry for poor Ms. Leigh, but weirdly, Perkins's character is actually well spoken and sympathetic, a fellow that cares deeply about his poor old mum. The shrink explains the whole thing at the end with lots of 1950's psycho-babble.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|At last this movie comes out as it deserves. The picture and sound seem brand new. The 5.1 mix is so amazing. To enjoy it at its best, I took the phone off, then I staid put in my couch. I just have to say thank you mister Scott.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|DM rarely disappoints, with the surreal voice of its leader singer and the complex riffs.  It kind of falls down in the middle, but has some rousing songs to pick it up into a positive listening experience.
B000NA28IE|1.0|Where to begin? This movie was unclear and skippy. All the IMPORTANT things-- Teirm, Tronjheim, Hadrac Desert, Brom... Completely under done. If it didn't say ERAGON on the cover, I wouldn't have even thought they were related! No, no, no-- if the book had was NOT supposed to be based on the book, it would have been a mediocre movie-- But the script writers managed to break diamond and destroy the glory of a beautifully written  book. I never want to see a movie so tarnished: it made it look like they lived in mud huts, all the while the book described houses! This movie broke my heart and made me afraid to see another book-movie.    Let's hope that they don't reck Inkheart or Twilight...    ~Megan
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When it comes to Firefly, I sometimes find it hard to recommend it.  Sure, I've described it as the best TV \\"series\\" ever, but the problem is it's not a series -- just a single season.  For that reason, I've dubbed it as \\"the best TV series you'll wish you didn't watch\\" because it's such a tragedy that it was cancelled.  I watched the entire season in one sitting and was left wanting more.  Much, much more.      This show seamlessly meshes numerous different locales, cultures, times and genres into a single story.  It's got spaceships and cowboys; humor, horror and drama; American and Chinese culture. Josh Whedon and the cast did such an amazing job that I can't even describe it to you; you'll need to watch it.  Sooner or later, you may wish you didn't though.  Then again, who knows, if it gets a few thousand more 5-star reviews here at Amazon, maybe we'll see the Brown Coats return some day...
B000007S5B|5.0|The Doors Waiting for the Sun is a really magnificent album that, for some reason or another, faces constant criticism.  There's really nothing bad or even average about it to warrant negative ratings all the time!  I'm not a huge fan of the Doors, but I know quality songwriting when I hear it, and this album has LOADS of creativity.    Many people hate \\"Hello, I Love You\\" for some reason.  I think it's a great song that the 90's rock band Smash Mouth ripped off BIG time for their \\"Walkin' on the Sun\\" smash hit.  Hmmm... that song title sounds awfully close to \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" doesn't it???    \\"Love Street\\" is a perfect ballad with brilliant piano soloing that gives the song a jazzy edge.  \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\" is a psychedelic blues song that leads perfectly into the greatest song on the album \\"Wintertime Love\\".  The next track, \\"The Unknown Soldier\\" brings back the distinct spookiness that made the Doors debut album so unforgettable.  You don't hear musicians today write songs like that.  It's completely unlike anything else out there.    \\"Spanish Caravan\\" is simply beautiful, \\"My Wild Love\\" is hauntingly creepy, \\"We Could Be So Good Together\\" is probably the Doors idea of a pop song, \\"Yes, the River Knows\\" again has some spooky piano bits that make the hair on the back of my neck stand up, and \\"Five to One\\" is a great jam with fantastic electric guitar playing.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\".  Let's just say, that song is absolutely fantastic and probably the second best song on the album.    Every song I mentioned is really good, and guess what?  I mentioned every song on the album!.  I love the entire thing.  You really need to pick up this wonderful piece of distinct rock music.  The Doors sounded like absolutely no one else back in the day, and this is another highlight of their career.
B00117P0HE|5.0|Why are you rating the movie down based on Unbox service? Rate the movie as you would normally, and then comment on how horrible your unbox service is.

B00000JHAU|5.0|I thought that it was a little light in the loafers but my wife loved it.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|I was always amazed that the studios didn't issue a remastered version of Blade Runner with all of the extras at the same time that the Matrix came out on DVD.  Alas, it has finally arrived!  I've always been a HUGE fan of Blade Runner and I loved the Director's Cut that excluded the voice over.  I must say, however, that after reading some of the other reviews, I now fully understand why many might like the voice over.  The great thing about this release is that it includes both, so everyone should be happy.  I'm going to assume you are intimately familiar with the plot and move on to my review of this particular 4 disk release of Blade Runner.    The documentaries on the second and fourth disk are absolutely fabulous.  All of the cast members who are still alive are interviewed at length, as well as some who tried out for the roles of Rachel and Pris.  For those of you who are big fans of the movie and have been waiting for the story behind the movie, all of your questions are answered, and then some.      The fourth disk goes into details surrounding the cinematography and lighting, as well as a brief biography of Philip K. Dick which is revealing.  It covers the topics of cinematography and lighting in a way that are interesting to the lay audience (like me), but I imagine it could be quite academic for someone in the film industry who wants to understand how it was done before the days of CGI.  One of the young film makers interviewed said that he watches Blade Runner often, just to try and figure out how Ridley did the lighting, or got a certain cinematic effect, or what focal length a certain shot was made, etc.    The only problem I have is one of personal preference regarding an important change in dialogue in the Final Director's Cut in one particular scene.  What follows in the rest of this paragraph is a spoiler, so please skip this paragraph if you want all changes in the new version to be a surprise.  A key line near the end of the film between Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Tyrell (Joe Turkell), his \\"maker,\\" is changed in a way that I think dramatically changes the overall emotional impact of the film.  In the original, Tyrell asks Roy, \\"What can he (your maker) do for you?\\", and Roy responds, \\"I want more life, f_ _ _ _ _!\\" (insert expletive) In the new Final Director's Cut version, he says, \\"I want more life, father.\\"  If you're only a casual fan, this probably won't bother you. In fact, you probably won't even notice it. But for those die-hard fans like me, it will come as a big shock.    While I really appreciated some of the other subtle changes, such as fixing the scene where Zora crashes through the glass - which now actually looks like Zora (Joanna Cassidy) and not her stunt double with a cheap wig, or how at the end of the movie Roy's pigeon no longer flies away into a blue sky - this change in dialog between Roy Batty and Tyrell is not in keeping with the mood and direction of the film in my opinion and I really question why Ridley Scott would make this change.  The original dialog was much edgier and much more in keeping with the original, dark nature of the film.  This new line seems like it would appeal to a \\"kinder/gentler\\" Blade Runner fan, which isn't me.    In spite of this one issue pertaining to the single line of dialogue between Roy Batty and Tyrell (strictly in my own opinion), I highly recommend this 4 disk release of Blade Runner for the absolutely fantastic interviews and documentaries, as well as the multiple versions of the film.
0316010669|4.0|While not science, this book is thought provoking, interesting, and fun to read.  The writing is proficient, the subject is intriguing, and the author offers advice when to trust a snap judgment, and when not to trust it.  Good book.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I've never read the Harry Potter books, nor ever had an urge too upon their popular release.  I gave the films a try and I must say that this is far better than I expected.  I can now see why the series is so popular.  I still haven't read the books only becuase I don't want it to ruin the movies that I love so much, casue there is bound to be continuity issues, common with most novel to film releases.  Though the Sorcerer's Stone is a great film, it is very mild for where the series is headed.  Each Potter adventure grows darker and more dangerous, but the first film is rather easy going overall.  Indeed, this is a fun film that people of all ages will enjoy, and is great for the kids.<br /><br />After seeing the latest Potter film - Order of the Phoenix - it is quite a surprise to come back to see where it all began.  Naturally, the young actors look so much younger, and its fun to see where they had come from, both in terms of age as actors and their characters - specifically referring to Harry, Ron, and Hermoine.  As with most series, the first is an introduction.  Since the Potter films were already pre-written into glorious novels, each book carried its own story.  So yes, this is an introduction to the Potter series, but at the same time it is a story about the Sorcerer's Stone, just like the next film is a tale about the Chamber of Secrets and the next etc.  Though entertaining and enjoyable, I did not find the Sorcerer's Stone to be the most intriguing story thus far in the series, in fact, its more likely the least favorite of mine, but that's ok.  Its still good, but the stories get better in each new film.<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone is very well made, complete with great sets, amazing costumes, lovebale and admirable characters, and plenty of good ol magic and flying brooms to go around.  If you are at all familiar with the game of Quidditch, it is not only introduced here, but a game is focused on more than any of the films thus far - complete with intense scenes of action and sport.<br /><br />If you are still one of the few who have not seen Harry Potter, go ahead and give it a try - chances are you are bound to find something that holds you're interest.  It is a great tale of suspense and adventure with a variety of great characters.  If you've seen all the films, I will remind you how much fun it is to go back and start all over again just to see how far we've come.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 3.5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5ction and sport.

B000YPUF9W|2.0|Spoilers may follow, depending upon what trailers you seen or what your expectations are...      The things that set the Resident Evil movies apart from typical zombie movies have apparently been used up.  This third installment in the series is best described as dumb.  Not the good dumb that you get in the campy zombie movies that don't pretend to take themselves or their subjects seriously, but the bad dumb where the movie is trying not to be dumb but still being dumb.    The movie stars Alice, the mutantly-engineered butt-kicking heroine of the series.  Only now her arsenal also includes some criminally underused powers (call it telekinesis for lack of something better).  Though her powers can tip any scale she still prefers good old fashioned boots and knives when she fights though - don't ask me why, that is just how she rolls.    Also in the movie (but hardly important) is a convoy of survivors uninfected by the zombie plague that is hard at work destroying the planet.  They have apparently been on the move for some time now   but haven't really learned much along the way and it soon becomes   obvious that their survival is more about luck than any real skill   or intelligence.  Soon the survivors are being picked off en mass   as fodder to bloody up the action sequences - hey, the movie needs   someone for the zombies to kill, right? Really, don't bother getting attached to anyone they have zero effect on the story.    Just like every other zombie film there are certain roles that must be filled.  You must have the hero/heroin who chooses to die with spectacular honor and intestinal fortitude despite their death actually accomplishing nothing that couldn't have been accomplished in some other manner.  You must have the infected person who hides their infection from everyone and then at the worst possible time when everyone is already neck deep in trouble they turn into a zombie and attack some unsuspecting person.    The movie is full of stupid things like this.  How about crows carrying people around and pushing out windows? Yup, you've even got those.    Really the movie runs in circles setting up one brief fight with another but it is only action for the sake of action.  The plot here is almost non-existent, the characters are disposable, and the villain is entirely forgettable.
B00008DDXC|5.0|It is year two at Hogwarts, and there are already big changes at work since the first film.  The three main characters - Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are quickly beginning to grow up.  Their actor counterparts will be the biggest surprise, with the boys already sporting much lower voices and taller heights.  Most of the same characters return from the first film, along with some newcomers such as the villainous Lucius Malfoy - deliciously played by Jason Isaacs (you may remember him as Mel Gibson's opponent in The Patriot).  His son, Draco, returns as well, up to his usual no good ways of insulting Harry and his friends.<br /><br />The story behind \\"you know who\\" continues in this film.  The Chamber of Secrets is the newest mystery at Hogwarts, and the biggest threat at present.  Harry must follow lots of clues to solve the puzzle, which is fun in the sense of watching a good mystery.  Aside from the chamber plot, there is a lot of fun in this film, including a lot of action and a lot of humor - a huge improvement over the first film.  Even the special effects have easily tripled in effectiveness, especially an intense scene of Quidditch and the very scary and amazing climactic showdown of the film - easily better than the climax of the prior movie as well.<br /><br />Overall, Chamber is much edgier, darker, scarier, and intriguing than the first Potter film.  This is easily one of my favorite films of the series to date, mostly because it has come so far as a sequal.  Though the films are meant to follow the novels of Rowling, the creators of this film have definetly put more into the second Potter film than one might expect.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5
B00008DDSC|1.0|i watch it once and didnt like it but couldnt understand why,so i watch  second time,third time and now i see the light.  there is no entertaiment value,director jumping  from idea to idea  never connecting anything logically and clearly  dont know  men's  mentality.the events  are taking  place in private like outside  world dont exist whereas in real life its opposite;  and on a top of it  the actors are excellent.
B00005JMAH|4.0|This movie serves many purposes, and one I see is a transitional period between the first two Potter films into the next two currently out.  The three main characters (Harry, Ron & Hermoine) have quickly grown up, both in terms of physicalness and intelligence.  Each film has also become inreasingly darker, and the Dementors alone in Prisoner give this a very creepy tone that surpases anything we've seen yet.  The story, took me a few viewings to figure everything out.  It contains a bit more depth and detail than previous films, and younger children may not be able to pick all of it up immediately.  What I loved most about the first two films, seems to be a bit lacking in Prisoner.  While there is an interesting story, it takes itself more seriously, thus eliminating some of the great action, humor, and time spent on typical Hogwarts characters.<br /><br />Lack of tight pacing is the biggest reason I don't like Prisoner as much as the other Potter films.  There are smaller details that bothered me as well.  Quidditch is one of my favorite things to watch in the Potter films, however there is only a very small scene of a game in this film, seriously lacking compared to the previous two films.  Draco is still up to no good, thinking he's a teeange villain, but he comes off as a complete wuss in this film.  His father, Lucious, was missed in this film after a nice performance in Chamber.  Valdomort, is not in the story either, though the events of Sirius Black do relate to him.<br /><br />Things I do like though are also smaller matters.  I enjoy the hippogriff in the film, who actually plays a role in the story, and isn't just there for the cool flying scene we first see with he and Harry.  Though the Quidditch game is very short, it was neat while it lasted, taking place in a heavy thunderstorm, displying some impressive effects.  I even enjoyed the map that Harry receives that shows who all is walking Hogwarts at present.  And then there is Professor Snape, who is played as good as ever by Alan Rickman.  As for Dumbledore, no longer played by the late Richard Harris, the new Micahel Gambon seemed unfitting, at first.  After watching the next Potter films in the series, I feel he fills the role quite well.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great film, just my least favorite in the Potter series to date.  Remember though, things begin to get very dark in this one and the story takes some patience to follow.  This is a transitional film in the series, leading to the very much improved and solid Goblet of Fire.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 3<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4s ever by Alan Rickman.

B000BCE7QU|5.0|Following on from their hugely promising February 1984 debut \\"Swoon\\", England's PREFAB SPROUT took many English and Irish hearts by storm in the summer and autumn of 1985 with their stunning 2nd album \\"Steve McQueen\\". Rated by many as being in the Top 50 albums of all time, this April 2007 2CD LEGACY EDITION is a long overdue remastered celebration of that bedsit staple.<br /><br />Here's the layout first - Disc 1 (45:13 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 11 are the album \\"Steve McQueen \\" issued in June 1985 on Kitchenware Records KW 3 in the UK (Vinyl, Cassette and CD). The US version was called \\"Two Wheels Good\\" for contractual reasons and was issued on Epic 40100.  The CD version contained 3 bonus tracks - \\"Faron Young (Truckin' Mix)\\", \\"The Yearning Loins\\" and \\"He'll Have To Go\\" - they were not included on the UK version - nor unfortunately included here on this reissue either. This Legacy reissue is remastered by original producer THOMAS DOLBY at The Mastering Lab in Los Angeles  - he also contributes recollections to the liner notes.<br /><br />Disc 2 (35:00 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 8 are brand new acoustic re-interpretations by Paddy McAloon of 8 tracks from the original 11 - they were recorded across the summer of 2006.<br /><br />The 2CDs are housed in a card gatefold digipak (where's the Legacy Edition Protective Plastic outer wrap?), have motorbike logos on the CDs and a scant 12-page booklet with liner notes by PAUL LESTER. There are some new photos - outtakes from the album cover shoot, but bizarrely the original inner sleeve of the LP depicting the members of the band and giving recording details is missing. But worse is the lack of musical extras. Between October 1984 and as late as February 1986, no less than 6 singles came off the album - When Love Breaks Down was put out 3 times  - Faron Young, Appetite and Johnny Johnny were issued also - between them they produced as many as 12 unreleased B-sides and mixes. As you can see from the playing time on both discs, there was plenty of room for remasters of these rarities. They will probably never see the light of day now - which is maddening - especially on a supposed collector's edition. However, the other way of looking at it is this - presented as is - this reissue forces you to focus 'only' on the album proper - and the new acoustic tracks - and as they stand - they make for a truly sensational listen.<br /><br />Which brings us to the SOUND... Like many who've loved this wonderful record, I've had the cramped vinyl LP and dull sounding original CD for over 20 years now - hoping for a good reissue of it at some point. Well this Thomas Dolby remaster is just BEAUTIFUL - clean, muscular and full of presence. Finally hearing the sublime \\"Bonny\\" in this sound quality is a treat no music lover should be without - and that synth solo - wow! And when you think of how awful a lot of Eighties music sounds now - so dated and over-produced - musically the whole album still holds it own. So many great tracks \\"Moving The River\\", \\"Desire As\\" and the Johnny Johnny song \\"Goodbye Lucille No.1\\" A really sweet remaster by Dolby - but the real fireworks start on Disc 2...<br /><br />Few would have expected that Acoustic Tracks could sound this good or even rival and better the originals - but here they do. It's hard to understate just how stunning these reinterpretations are - I've been playing them to buggery for over 18 months now and still don't tire of them. I made up a shop-play disc of 7 tracks from Ryan Adams' \\"Easy Tiger\\" album from 2007 with 7 from this - and every time I play it, it never fails to bring customers to the counter with looks of `discovery' on theirs faces wanting to know \\"Who is this!!!\\"<br /><br />To sum up - despite the ok-only packaging and lack of those b-sides - this is a 5-star reissue of a 6-star album - a must buy.<br /><br />I will go weak at the knees if the same treatment is planned for the equally magnificent \\"Jordon: The Comeback\\"...for remasters of these rarities.

0143038583|5.0|Pollan's writing is infomrative and pleasurable. The book clearly explains the premise that the Western diet is unhelathy. Unhealthy from a dietary, environmental and social perspectives. This is the book that provided me the impetus to really consider what I purchased and ate. It will make you think twice before hurrying through the produce aisle to get to the prepackaged foods to prepare a quick meal, and it may even give you pause about buying your vegatables from the grocery store rather than the farmers' market.    Second Nature, Botany of Desire, and Omnivore's Dilemma all provide an interesting perspective on our relationship with other living things in the garden and larger natural world. His insightful observations about nature and biology will ring true for many, especially organic gardeners.

He is capable of learning so much in so little time.  This often scares others around him that are not used to this side of him.  He is challenged with dealing with his abilities, his love interest, and how others perceive him, not to mention a few alphabet agencies that want him as well.<br /><br />In the end, he only has a short time to do what he wants.  Great movie, bit of a tear jerker, one for the library.

B000Y7U98W|4.0|\\"Sunshine\\" is an involving, entertaining movie with a fascinating premise.(see plot info below Spoilers warning below if you want to find out more about it). The visuals are often stunning and the style of the film succeeds often even when the content (in the form of Alex Garland's script)doesn't. Although a bit uneven (particularly the last third of the film where there is a dramatic shift in tone and focus in the story), \\"Sunshine\\" is one heck of a ride for science fiction fans.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br />A form of proto matter called a \\"Q ball\\" has disrupted the sun's ability to produce energy. It's slowly cooling off most of life on Earth could die. The crew of the Icarus II (the ship no doubt named with a bit of irony)are sent to detonate a device powered by compressed dark matter in the heart of the sun blowing apart the \\"Q ball\\" and, essentially, restarting the sun.<br /><br />As they reach Mercury they have a number of accidents that prevent them from completing their mission. Luckily the crew finds the remains of the first ship the Icarus I which disappeared en route and can use its materials to complete their own. That's when disaster truly strikes putting their lives and mission in danger.<br /><br />Although this isn't quite as powerful as \\"Trainspotting\\" or as compelling as \\"28 Days Later\\", Boyle's film has plenty of tension and suspense. For those science folks keeping track Boyle does take liberties with the science to rachett up the level of suspense in a number of scenes but the film stays remarkably accurate for most of the science content(and given that Q Balls are still theortical and their existance hasn't been confirmed).<br /><br />The film stumbles a bit by the last third with an unexpected plot twist that alters the direction of the film but Boyle and Garland manage to recover nicely bringing the film to a satisfying conclusion. The visual effects and production design are both quite stunning given the smaller than usual budget this science fiction film has. This film was, along with \\"3:10 to Yuma\\", \\"No Country for Old Men\\" and \\"Atonement\\" one of the highlights of last year.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks very good with a nice transfer and an often stunning audio mix. Update: Be aware, however, that there have been some reports of difficulty playing the disc and long loading times. It could be due to new copy protection codes there is no clear answer as to yet and Fox hasn't commented on the problems. I didn't have any problems but did have a longer than usual load time but it did play fine.<br /><br />Also, some of the interactive special features are designed for 1.1 players (most current units are 1.0 as of 1/08 with only a couple of 1.1 models on the market)and may not play on 1.0 models such as the Samsung 1400 or some Panasonic and Sony models that are commonly stocked in electronic stores such as Bestbuy and Circut City).<br /><br />We get two short films \\"Dad's Dead\\" and \\"Mole Hill\\" that use cutting edge techniques to tell their own fractured stories. We also get a commentary track from science advisor (and inspiration for the film)Dr. Brian Cox from CERN, Manchester University and director Danny Boyle discussing everything from the science to the changes that had to be make in the script due budget issues.<br /><br />Also included are deleted scenes a similar but less dramatic alternate ending for the film and the original theatrical trailer. We also get a pip option for the film as well.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Fox Searchlight was thinking when they released this film towards the end of the Summer blockbuster season of 2007 where it could (and did)get lost nor am I sure why the film wasn't given a wider release (or why the Fox marketing department did such a lousy job of promoting the film except for the website)but \\"Sunshine\\" reminds us of the fine line between life and death in the cold space that surrounds us.along with \\"3:10 to Yuma\\", \\"No Country for Old Men\\" and \\"Atonement\\" one of the highlights of last year.

B000A176VU|5.0|[[ASIN:006074815X Eye of the Needle]]  Henry Faber alias, The Needle, is a German spy who works for Germany during World War II. He is tall, handsome, intelligent, well built, German aristocrat who works fast, in a shrewd manner, cleanly, and without leaving a trace. He is very close to Hitler. When a person becomes a danger to his identity or whereabouts, he uses an \\"stilletto\\" to utterly kill without almost any evidence.   The Needle or Die Nadle, discovers a British military secret that if given to the Germans on time would, no question about it, make the Germans win the war. Then the British find out about it, then starts the run, hide and go of The needle. All the Allied and British military intelligence are looking for him with no results But nobody but a woman, Lucy Rose, who lives in a stormy and far away island , can get to him...   The novel is excellently written and keeps the reader interested until the end. It also depicts all the knowledge about military intelligence, spies and world War II that the author masters.   I strongly recommend this book as a novel to entertain, and \\"A Place Called Freedom\\", also written by Ken Follet.

I've had to limit myself to only making one new recipe per week or else I'd never leave the kitchen (not to mention the weight I'd likley gain - LOL). It is not only full of great recipes (so far my 2 favourites are are the corn bread and the olive and sun-dried tomato bread), but it is full of great information. The \\"tips\\" are wonderful, the pictures are inspiring and the outcome is delicious!!!!    Congratulations and thank you Colleen for this gift to the palate!
B0010AN7Y0|5.0|I saw this movie as a mere random pick when I was in graduate school and it made a huge impression on me. I ran out and got the VHS. I have constantly been monitoring the internet for the dvd and finally it is available in the States.  Emma Thompson's revelation to Stephen Fry (\\"fill me with your little babies\\") and Rita Rudner's acknowledgement she has filled her transatlantic luggage with weights are two of my favorite moments of all time.  If you enjoy those things British and sardonic, this is a MUST movie.
0439813786|5.0|I often times find myself bored to tears with the books I read my children.  Often times, I have to read the same dull book over and over.  If that were not bad enough, there are times when my younger daughter falls in love with the same book and the whole terrible cycle begins again.  (Care Bears, Dora the Explorer, Scooby Doo etc., etc.)    I read the \\"Invention of Hugo Cabret\\" to my five year old son and I think it was a break out book for the both of us.  It was one of the first books that we could both really appreciate together.  I enjoyed the more complex story and the beautiful drawings helped my son grasp the more sophisticated plot line.  It is a beautifully imagined book and I would recommend it for any child who has the ability to concentrate on a story that will take many days to read.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|This is truly a gift. I often wonder why the great singers of the 1960s & 70s are only displayed for brief moments in Time Life CD ads. These wonderful images and sounds of Johnny and his guests such as Waylon Jennings, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Creedence and many more. I remember it as a must see show in my youth and this compilation is super. I would also think that there could be much more in the archives - or at least - I would hope so. This is a visual and audio must.    It is good to see these legendary performers in their prime.
B000J103WK|5.0|My husband received this DVD as a gift from our middle son, and we both loved it!  Not only does it bring back some great memories listening to hits like Love Will Keep Us Alive, Take It Easy, Tequila Sunrise and Peaceful Easy Feeling, but Glen Frey, Don Henley and Joe Walsh are so funny!<br /><br />One of them notes that his wife refers to \\"Take it to the Limit\\" as the credit card song.  And in introducing, \\"Lying Eyes,\\" he notes he wrote that song for his ex-wife...Plaintiff!<br /><br />The songs are great and the guys are clearly having fun.  And it's really cool to hear them sing the songs the way you remember them.  Sometimes bands will change things up a little when they sing old songs, but the Eagles stay true to the original tune and rhythm of their songs.<br /><br />This is a great DVD, which I would recommend to all Eagles fans!
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is simply a fantastic collection of performances and songs. But i hasten to add that there is much excellent material on zep's original live album set 'The Song Remains The Same' - which is why I am so puzzled at all the garbage people are throwing at that album! It is insane. I defy any zep fan to deny the greatness of The Rain Song, No Quarter, The Song Remains The Same (the song), Rock and Roll, and much of Dazed and Confused on the earlier live album (Page's 'violin-bowed' solo is absolutely spooky...and powerful). What live zep doesn't have its share of over-the-top (indulgent people say) guitar at points? (it's more fun that way! it's live for chrissakes) Also, each of the live albums has a long drum solo in Moby Dick. What's more...those 'Houses of the Holy' tracks i mention above - do not appear on How The West Was Won (though many others do). Get both I say..and refrain from this childish over-choosiness haha. Both albums have their attributes and even a different sort of mix. 'The West' has some wonderful acoustic songs by the way.  I have them both in my portable stereo and am happily suffering another bout of zeppelin-isme.
B000002H2H|4.0|After the blistering debut Metallica delve further into their psyche, further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated NWOBHM muse. And it's a more difficult metal experience in general, the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument. Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener.<br /><br />After that however the differences start seeping in. Ride The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I'm not sure it needs it. For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it's excellent musical and lyrical assault. The production values on this album seem a little dull, the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door.<br /><br />But the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release. The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu. And the literary references are a nice touch. Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends (hey, we've all been there), it's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it.<br /><br />All up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice. There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there. But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff. In fact I'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it's debut Kill `Em All through to the black album. If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum.

B000002HRE|3.0|The story goes that much of the material for this release was written around the time of the Load sessions and certainly there is a constant vein throughout. So if you liked Load then you'll probably like this given it has a similar feel and the songs have familiar structures. And a number of interesting things are tried here such as the inclusion The Unforgiven II, a sequel to the bands hit The Unforgiven from the black album. And while it has been done before by bands Metallica are perhaps to be lauded for revisiting a lyrical theme so openly, to try to take the story further.<br /><br />Further kudos are warranted for the fact that the band stuck to their guns in the face of some not unjust criticism of the Load album, the band quite clearly believing that these songs had a purpose and deserved to be aired in a formal release, as opposed to the inevitable inclusion in some latter day `from the vault' style release.<br /><br />The long and the short of it is however that the band are wrong. These are not important, nor overly worthwhile songs and the simple fact is that given that most of these songs were apparently done in the same writing sessions and yet didn't make the Load album - that kind of tells you something doesn't it. This is the second rate songs from those writing sessions dressed up and send to an unloving and underwhelmed public and the few outstanding tracks are mercifully at the start of the album; Fuel - the nearest thing to a blazing mindless good time track on the album; The Memory Remains - which rides a slow and pounding riff which threatens critical mass and, well, that's about it really. Download the first two songs and The Unforgiven II if you really must and save yourself the postage and packing on this stupor inducing bunch of also ran tunes.<br /><br />And what is that on the cover - heck who knows, this is a band that speaks through it's music, lucky given they seem to visually have so little to say on their album covers from grunge onwards.

His performance starts with the slimy little character with no self-respect and concludes with a character that fights for love.  The scene where he faces himself in the mirror and tells himself \\"I love you\\" is an emotional thunderbolt.  It's rare to find such a balanced intense performance as Debbouze performs.  The French Academy of Cinema twice nominated him for Best Supporting Actor for [[ASIN:B0000640VO Amelie]] and \\"Asteix et Obelix: Mission Cleopatre.\\"  He won the Best Actor Award at Cannes for \\"Days of Glory.\\"<br /><br />The other main character is Angel-A.  Rie Rasmussen played in Brian DePalma's film [[ASIN:B0000897EA Femme Fatale]].  As the other-worldly beauty, she takes the role through the roof with her physical force and appeal.  Gilbert Melki plays Franck to whom Andre owes money.  Olivier Cloverie turns in a nice cameo performance as the U.S. Secretary at the Embassy who eventually throws Andre out on his ear.<br /><br />Besson shows both a romantic side and philosophic depth with \\"Angel-A.\\"  Issues of loving yourself, being true to principle while living in an imperfect -- often sleazy -- world make the film significant.  Paris as the backdrop is filmed gorgeously.  The making of \\"Angel-A\\" on the DVD is an intriguing extra as we see these professionals at work on the project.  Enjoy!
B000002HMH|3.0|Load is probably the album Metallica had to make. As Lars has said over the years, the band came to enjoy the creative process of the studio to a great extent and the band very intelligently chose not to do massive tours anymore, preferring short and sharp blasts.<br /><br />And after the string of albums they released in the 80's culminating in the mega selling black album. One gets the feeling that this was a cathartic experience for the band in some ways, the band trying new speeds and really taking the self confidence of having sold a squillion and translating that into an attempt to create a fuller listening experience.<br /><br />Because on the face of it the band have here put meaty riff monsters like Ain't My Bitch and 2 x 4 which are musically heavy juxtaposed with The House That Jack Built and Until It Sleeps, songs that are cerebrally heavy even if they aren't hitting your eardrums like a B-52.<br /><br />Mid paced stompers are also in attendance, stuff like Poor Twisted Me and King Nothing both having plaintive and not entirely stoopid lyrical concerns. Which makes the absence of the lyrics in the booklet a real shame. But then it was the mid 90's and you were supposed to put out albums without lyrics in the booklet. Ho hum.... Then again the whole booklet is a bit of a disaster. But let's not go there - I've worn some dodgy gear in my time too...<br /><br />I guess my main issue with this album isn't the change of direction. Nor necessarily the new things tried. It's just that the new things tried don't work. About half this album feels like filler. I mean, for those of you out there reading this who have listened to the album - think back to the album for a moment and try to recall a single thing about the following songs - Bleeding Me, Wasting My Hate, Mama Said, Thorn Within, Ronnie or album closer The Outlaw Torn. See what I mean?<br /><br />Great band, some interesting ideas and some bravery shown when they could of just put out the black album part two, but this is as much miss as it is hit and the hits landed aren't heavy ones. More cruiserweight blows.<br /><br />And really - surely it was the band or their management that put out that the blood/semen on the cover was Kirk Hammetts. I mean, it's a pretty random concept. I guess someone thought that putting that story out would make it all the more confronting. Um... No, not really.s hit and the hits landed aren't heavy ones. More cruiserweight blows.

B0007Y08IS|4.0|The creative crew behind South Park are raunchy, worse than irreverent, and often brilliant. This ain't for everyone, and I couldn't have sat through this with my kids (the scatalogico-sexual humor and profanities were just too much), but I'm glad I...(read more) saw it.<br /><br />Team America (\\"America, f*ck yeah!\\") roots out evil wherever it be simultaneously leaving confusion and destruction in its wake. Not too hard to see a pointed criticism here. But lest the hawks feel picked on, the doves get theirs too - in spades. No one is spared. This film won't make much sense to most people in 20 years, but it does now. So if you can tolerate it, check it out before the shelf-life is up.<br /><br />And Kim Jong-il's solo, \\"I'm So Ronery,\\" is alone worth watching this filthy, delightful little show.
B00000FCBC|3.0|What a great package this represents for the hardcore fan and the more casual fan alike. But regardless it is also very much a tale of two very different disks. Disc 1 is basically rubbish. And it shouldn't be as it has a few funny things and a few well respected metal tunes such as Diamond Heads It's Electric and a cover of a sort-of cover in Thin Lizzy's Whiskey In The Jar. But nobody I know has ever managed to listen to the thing in one sitting, rather cherry picking a couple of tunes each day to try to internalise the collection that way. Perhaps some of this stuff was just too obscure for the 1998 metalhead buying public. Or it could be the lifeless feel of the thing. Either way it's universally loathed.<br /><br />No such problems with the second disc. It fairly rips your head off and then stitches it back on backwards for you. There are collectors out there who love nothing more than to have the original releases of stuff like Garage Days Revisited from '84 and Re-revisited from `87. But let's face it sometimes you have to part with some serious cash to get that sort of stuff and Metallica go a long way to refurbishing their reputation as a band that cares by here getting all that good stuff onto one disc. And backing it up with some of their b-sides. And Metallica have picked some pretty awesome songs to record as b-sides over the years. Say what you will but some of them have been such inspired choices that bands like Diamond Head have gotten new leases of life merely through the association of their songs with Metallica. Which is a real community service by the band in some ways.<br /><br />Also on this disc is Motorheadache, a batch of Motorhead covers the band recorded in 1995 in homage to Lemmy, and given the way the man has been venerated anew in the 00's Metallica here showed themselves ahead of the curve in their respect of the man.<br /><br />A very good buy for collectors and more casual fans alike for the value packed nature of the second disc. But man, does that first CD stink.D stink.
1401302378|5.0|Wired magazine packs some of the best technology writers and new economy experts in the world, and with this book Chris Andersen asserts his position as the leader of the pack. This book has the right mix of the essential ingredients of a good business book: enough rigor for business theory but not so much as to make it dry; enough anecdotes to bring the point home but not so much as to make it repetitive; enough opinions and wit to make the reader question but not so much as to make it biased and shallow.<br /><br />Like all mainstream business books, this one does not resist the temptation to encapsulate all business and socio-cultural phenomena around one simple theory. However, Anderson maintains the humility to admit discovery than claim invention. Expect this concept to become as widespread and oft-quoted (if not more) in understanding the digital consumer economy, than [[ASIN:0060517123 Geoffrey Moore's Chasm]] was/is in understanding the evolution of hi-tech products.
B000002H33|4.0|Metallica were indeed the puppetmasters on this very heavy metal release. The album cover speaks volumes, a field of white crosses attached to hands in the sky sporting strings with which to control the puppets. This album reeks of power in it's production values and in many of it's lyrical concerns. Just like And Justice For All this is an album that could in many ways be representative of much of the metal genre in terms of it's communication of ideas through sheer musical brute force. I guess in later years this would of been described as true metal, or traditional metal. The band here achieve that state where a band can address a number of issues yet still have their album sound right when taken as a whole, the entire NWOHM concept renewed, invigorated to a new level.<br /><br />That's not to say that this album is flawless, Metallica always managed to get by with a bunch of filler tunes per album but dress things up to look like the thing was the `all killer, no filler' real deal. And this album is no different. Tunes like Disposable Heroes at 8:14 is overlong and not really biting enough. All my musician mates liked Orion but it just sounded like noise to me - I preferred the Rodrigo Y Gabriela acoustic version myself as I always felt Metallica circa 1986 weren't quite up to the task of creating over eight minutes of really interesting instrumental music.<br /><br />But there is no arguing with Batter, a right facemelter of a tune. And the title track is a metal tour de force. There is some nice layered guitar riffs to be found in Welcome Home (Sanitarium) and Damage, Inc is somewhat amusing while not surrendering it's heaviness quotient.<br /><br />All up this to me is sort of the start of Metallicas golden run, which they'd continue with on And Justice For All and then take to a new level commercially with the black album. An arresting listen even if it does miss the mark a touch in places and certainly any metallica fans collection isn't complete until they get this album. Total newcomers, if any exist, would perhaps be better served heading to either the debut or the aforementioned black album as a starting point and working from there as this may be a little dense for the novice.ewcomers, if any exist, would perhaps be better served heading to either the debut or the aforementioned black album as a starting point and working from there as this may be a little dense for the novice.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this fun, fantasy film from start to finish. The acting, storyline, and so on was great and at a nice pace.... Even the special effects were enjoyable to watch. A must see family film!!
B000002H6C|4.0|An album that I play rarely because I'm not much of a fan of it's convoluted structures. Call me dull, but just a couple of riffs are enough for me per song. This thing sounds like it's been put together as a catalogue. And a pretty darn good one it is. But the songs are just too dense for me overall. That's not to say however that I can't appreciate the talent and sheer excellence of much of what is going on here.<br /><br />Firstly this album contains Metallicas first bonafide hit - One. Some people may not like this but as far as I'm concerned it's an excellent tune. And the video supporting it was excellent too and the combination of audio and visual - well who knows how many extra sales that combination scored for this release. The album also contains the lead track Blackened which has some truly excellent riffing (more on that later).<br /><br />Secondly the actual track lengths are long but naturally so. You don't get the impression that these songs were artificially extended just because the band wanted to show a lack of communication, a more difficult metal experience. Merely this is just what the songs are. And that makes the thing feel natural.<br /><br />Thirdly the albums cover art and the over riding themes on it carry on very much from Master of Puppets and that is no bad thing at all, a feeling of actual social worth to much of what the band was going on about at the time and that feeling of inclusivity is another factor why this album, exhausting as it can be for some listeners, has actually been enjoyed by so many over the years.<br /><br />But of course there is a reason why I haven't given this five stars. Despite the feelings of inclusion the subject matter at times engenders and despite the excellent composition and playing skills required of the guys with guitars and despite the excellent production that lets the various components breath, this album does have some trouble with connectivity. And going back to what I was saying about the excellent riffing in Blackened - I mean before the vocals actually start there are something like three very usable riffs. An older Metallica probably would of shaved this song to somewhere around the five minute mark rather than it's 6:40 running time here and cut out the use of at least one riff. And made the song more communicative at the same time. But no less heavy. And saved themselves and excellent riff for use elsewhere.<br /><br />Well, they do say with age comes wisdom, or in this case perhaps restraint.<br /><br />As I say, an album of excellent metal riffery, a couple of brilliant songs and a heck of a lot of hard work from all involved. Just not exactly a party album or an easy listening experience. I play this about as often as Dragonforces' Inhuman Rampage.an before the vocals actually start there are something like three very usable riffs.

B000AGTPUK|4.0|Great computer graphics in this movie and great message in the power of believing in the true power of Christmas. This is a great family, holiday movie and a classic in years to come. The storyline is timeless and the movie is all around fun to watch. This movie has a lot of fun scenes and action in it that will keep kids watching it.
B000NVTHR8|5.0|After Forever unleash a self titled album in a bid for a certain level of freshness and almost as a defiant reaffirmation of intent. With big budget look, digipacks aplenty and more interviews clocked up than a politician trying to worm his way out of a sex scandal this release is a super serious play for market share, sales and respect for what they do.<br /><br />And pretty much all the planets align to allow After Forever to take their best shot as Euro stardom. The number of good quality song constructs here is a credit to the songwriting team. Right from the opening number Discord the listener hears everything but the kitchen sink being thrown at them. The lush modern recording values, the operatic touches seeming 90% of the female fronted metal bands dabble with and with obligatory gothic twinges firmly strapped in place this song swoops and soars to excellent effect. The dose is repeated for the second track, Evoke. Which it certainly does, a song that is both defiant and pleading at the same time due in no small part to the vocal abilities of Floor Jansen who has a voice that can be high pitched and ethereal but actually seems to often live in a more mid stream register which makes it far more listenable than so many other female singers out there who seem to be having a competition as to who can break the most glasses. And it's this that more than any other single facet of this release that aids in connectivity with the listener.<br /><br />As the album plays out the attention to detail and outright hard work that was obviously poured into producing this piece becomes apparent. Transitory ebbs and flows on an excellent Jansen vocal hook and the lovely ballad Energize Me shows that you can do a tender ballad within a metal band in 2007. As you should be able to do. Equally Destructive is an excellent angst ridden metal tune and really, there are a number of moments throughout this album where the utter metal stance of this band truly shines. Rather than a band who scored themselves a talented and photogenic lass and utilise her as a meal ticket (no names mentioned) this is a metal band that in some ways is fiercely traditional but also cherry picks so much that is good about the goth metal and female fronted metal scene that had been smouldering away for a good ten years prior to this albums release.<br /><br />The occasional use of male grunt vocals may be a concern for some potential listeners. All is not as bad as it could be as the vocalisation used by Sander Gommans is more demonic than gargled and actually fits the feel the band are trying to get across in each song he's utilised. The band seem to understand that they don't need to use him in each song but only where appropriate. And while usually I hate this sort of thing (see my review of Leaves Eyes Legend Land EP) I can appreciate here due to the perspective in which it's kept on this album<br /><br />And the same can be said of the bands use of the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra - restrained and appropriate. And a shout out to Doro Pesch who is utilised to excellent effect on her duet with Floor Jansen on Who I Am. An excellent song and you don't always expect such a different and strong song to be hidden at track ten on an album. This is certainly a release that rewards repeated and full listens.<br /><br />In case you've not figured it out yet - I really liked this album and feel that if your a fan of full bodied metal music but also like some light and shade, orchestration and aren't afraid of some twists and turns then this is an excellent piece of work to sink your teeth into.emselves a talented and photogenic lass and utilise her as a meal ticket (no names mentioned) this is a metal band that in some ways is fiercely traditional but also cherry picks so much that is good about the goth metal and female fronted metal scene that had been smouldering away for a good ten years prior to this albums release.

B000002H97|4.0|Just before writing this review I tried to think of other watershed albums from 1991. And none of those that came to mind really struck me as likely to knock this album off it's perch. I mean, Megadeths awesome Rust in Peace is the better album but that was 1990. Some might argue for the same mobs Countdown to Extinction, but that was 1992. So nope, no contest from either. Ditto for Judas Priests' Painkiller (1990). There was the Red Hot Chili Peppers album Blood Sugar Sex Magic, but as funky and jumpy as that was, you just know that in a ring the black album would, by law of averages, land a few blows and the scrawny surfy metal album would hit the canvas. Panteras' Vulgar Display of Power wouldn't grace the shelves until 1992 and while Metal Churchs' 1991 opus The Human Factor could probably go the full 12 rounds, on audience appeal alone the black album would still win.<br /><br />The reasons why aren't always so obvious. Obviously the bands time had come. A traditional build up of fortunes had positioned them nicely. After Hysteria went through the roof Joe Elliot once commented that Def Leppard could probably put out an album of bee farts and it would sell. And Metallica were probably in a similar position. So some of this albums appeal came from people being excited about whatever Metallica were going to do next.<br /><br />But what also got people excited was the actual songs on the record. The excellent traditional metal fare of Enter Sandman, the done me wrong nastiness of Sad But True and Holier than Thou working their sweet charm and the bands paeon to displaced youth The Unforgiven. And really, once the listener got through those four tunes the deal was probably closed. The somewhat more cerebral/triumphant/defiant Wherever I May Roam and the slow burn stomper of Don't Tread On Me are also highly worthwhile in their own right and the bands ability to go up and down the gears in terms of time signatures is shown all throughout these numbers up to and including Through the Never, the latter replete with swirling, head bang inducing guitar histrionics. At which point the band really drop down several gears at once to Nothing Else Matters, which spiritually I always felt was the antidote to Fade to Black from the earlier Ride The Lightning album.<br /><br />After that it probably doesn't matter that the rest of the album is basically filler, Metallica were always a band that could get away with a chunk of filler on a number of their albums and convince you the album was, in fact, all killer no filler anyway. Though My Friend Of Misery does indeed have an interesting and infectious groove even if the lyrical bent of the thing is a bit obtuse.<br /><br />This album works because there are a number of styles here, and all work. As opposed to the later Load albums which had a few different styles, not any of which really worked to great effect. An album that in so many ways was just destined to do well, but you don't hate it for that. After all this is a band that paid their dues and put together an excellent raft of tunes, tacked a few also-rans to the end of it to make up the numbers and then had all their planets aligned. Good luck to them. A good album with some excellent tunes on it, as opposed to an excellent album full stop, but still probably required listening for anyone wanting to delve into the Metallica catalogue.e Never, the latter replete with swirling, head bang inducing guitar histrionics.

This was a very beautifully written novel about how one naive girl's misinterpretaion and vengeance can affect many people's lives, all against the backdrop of World War II. I really liked the author's complex and insightful style of writing.
B000002KE2|5.0|BLACK SABBATH Vol. 4 is a classic metal album,it is in my most played list which I've probally listened to the cd that I bought in 1994 at least 500 times,no joking,it is that good.The album starts with 'Wheels Of Confusion' a perfect eight minute track with a killer guitar solo at the end from Tony Iommi.The album ends with 'Under The Sun/Every Day Comes And Goes' which is a great song to end this masterpiece of the art known as Heavy Metal.My personal favorite standouts are 'Wheels Of Confusion','Supernaut','Snowblind','Saint Vitus' Dance', and 'Under The Sun'.There are no fillers on this album,all ten tracks are very enjoyable.This is a must-have for any Black Sabbath collection.

0740748475|5.0|First of all, a quality product, heavy paper stock, half cloth classic binding, excellent typography, box might be a bit heftier for a 22 pound set, but that's being picky.  Moreover, what an incredible present for an 11 year old boy, the gift of reading. If you're put off by the price tag, don't be. Heck, you can spend that much on a plastic toy that will be junk in a day or two. For an \\"I hate reading\\" boy, give him the gift of reading, C&H. Not just reading, but vocabulary, I get word questions every few minutes, and he remembers the words. The writing is so consistently good that he doesn't want to miss a single line. He is now best friends with his 12 year old sister, 'cause he lends her the book, and they endlessly share the lines and cartoons. They spend hours glued to the books, the TV is off, and life is just fine in our happy little house. I could go on, but with 10-12,000 books in this house, we're booksellers btw, this is on the top shelf, esp wrt juvenalia, and should there ever be a C&H movie, I think these titles could rival Harry Potter in resurging reading in young people. God knows, they should!
B000IHY146|4.0|Whenever I put on Karen Dalton for friends, reactions are always strong. I've had people say, \\"Wow! Sounds like a Folksy, Billie Holliday!\\". Or: \\" Turn that crap off, sounds like a drunken cat in heat!\\"<br /><br />Love or hate it, Karen Dalton's cracked, nasal voice never fails to make an impression. But I've always appreciated idiosyncratic voices. Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Neil Young & Nina Simone--- to name a few. Yet, like Elvis, Johnny Cash or Lady Day, one listen to Dalton & you know immediately who it is. No mistaking. To me that is a mark of a fine singer.<br /><br />I think a strong case can made for singers these days favoring style over actually trying to communicate something to the listener. Which is something Dalton never fails to acheive. True, she's no Joni Mitchell in the songwriting department. Dalton was exclusively an interpreter of other people's songs, but bet she would've done a killer version of, \\"Case Of You\\".<br /><br />Alot of Dalton fans seem to prefer her 1st album. Fact is, many find this to be a misstep in an all-too-brief career. Mixed bag that the album is, I genuinely prefer In My Own Time to Love You The Best. One reason is the fact that she's playing with a full band that keeps her from getting too languid or self indulgent.<br /><br />For me the only missteps are 2 tracks: \\"When A Man Loves A Woman\\" & \\"How Sweet It Is\\". Both have been covered to death & smack of record company commercial pandering.<br /><br />Without a doubt my very favorite Karen Dalton song is \\"Katie Cruel\\". Harrowing and desolate. Much of the same can be said for the haunting, \\"Same Old Man\\". As for the songs featuring more studio backing, \\"Something On Your Mind\\" is just pure sugar to these ears. \\"Take Me\\" never fails to stop me in my tracks. \\"Are You Ready For The Country\\" ends the album on a yearning note.<br /><br />Ultimately, its up to your personal taste whether you like Dalton or not. To me her voice is as earthy as its ethereal. Despite her documented  substance abuse problems, her obscurity cannot wholly be attributed to that. According to popular report, she was a notoriously reluctant  performer. Furthermore, as evidenced by \\"Sweet It Is\\" & \\"Man Loves A Woman\\", her voice was never one that could be easily molded into the popular market. She was first & foremost a Folk singer.<br /><br />My advice? Start with her 1st album & then let this one work its slow magic on you and see if you don't come to appreciate it more.wholly be attributed to that.

055358894X|5.0|Scott Lynch has created an amazing story. The world he describes is fully fleshed out and so very real; part fantasy, part alternate universe, he creates a fantasy world that is both alien and yet immediately accessible, filled with magic, old world technology, and current world pop-culture. The characters are each unique, flawed, courageous, humorous, and very, very real.     I love fantasy-based stories, but grew tired of the typical quest style writings (as great as they are, this includes Tolkien's, Edding's, Donaldson's, Jordan's, and Martin's works). It was such a delight to read something that was both immediate, fantastical, and yet not bound by the traditions of typical fantasy styles.    I cannot speak more highly of this book. It may not be the greatest fantasy novel ever written (as the aforementioned authors still rightly own those), but it is genre defining. I expect in the years to come we will see more authors throw off the restrictions of past fantasy-novel structures and innovate as Lynch has done with his book. It is funny, tragic, exciting, interesting, and exciting (did I say that already?). What an amazing book (and I just got done reading the prologue for his second book, [[ASIN:0553804685 Red Seas Under Red Skies]], and saw that he continues to impress).    Let me just finish by saying: this book demands to be read. And to Scott Lynch: thank you for writing the best book I've read in years, and for renewing my love for books that truly transported me to a different place.
B000003BQW|5.0|I can't believe this album went out of print. This was, after some real dreck LPs, a true return to form from the most important band since The Beatles, maybe ever. It's terrific almost completely, not counting Cabbies on Crack and Heidi Is A Headcase (that title alone is unintentional self-parody), two tracks in a row to bring it down.  Songs like Strength to Endure, It's Gonna Be Alright (co-written by the great Andy Shernoff!!), Tomorrow She Goes Away, and Censors--t sound as great today as when they were released. The standouts, definitely.   Censhors--t was outdated at the time of the release, for in '92 Bush was not the choice of many, it was Clinton, Joey clearly had shown himself to be totally liberal, and this song against the PMRC was a bit too late, a second Bush administration was the real danger (sound familiar?). (Another REAL irony with this song is it probably couldn't have pleased Johnny, Mr. Conservative, more, for a vote against Clinton was one for Bush).  Take It As It Comes is a great Doors cover, excellent. Touring, a Beach Boys-style number, was of course a leftover from Pleasant Dreams. I Won't Let It Happen is a wonderful poppy number, also co-written by Andy Shernoff (of the world's greatest band of all time, The Dictators). The Job That Ate My Brain was always a fun number; Anxiety and Poison Heart BOTH sound much better now than years ago. Poison Heart in particular has really great lyrics.  Still, choosing it as the single? Didn't exactly work. Neither did the promo CD with interview and live tracks I used to have, \\"Talkin' Mondo Bozarro\\", released MONTHS after the release!! The reason this failed to be the success it deserved to be was Radioactive's fault entirely.  Even the cover is a mess, the real choice is so obvious: inside the booklet, used as an import cover for the two-part Poison Heart CD-singles, a photo collage of the Ramones (inside back cover of booklet) done (ahem) psychedelic-style (for serious lack of a better term!), itis not unlike a photo I saw for the original Revolver cover.(the lyrics were also only available in their entirety in the Japanese release, which came with a cool sticker, I can remember; maybe the import of this has corrected there only being lyrics to 5 songs of the 13).    Their best album after Too Tough To Die, better than that even, their best after Pleasant Dreams, maybe even their best after End Of The Century.  It never picked up after this for them; any bad reviews of this were and are nonsense. I know because I know Everything!  Seriously, I Am Right about this one.  If you like or love the Ramones (How can you NOT love, LOVE the Ramones?) -- you will enjoy this CD BIG-TIME!!  It was their last great moment in the sun, a real shame it didn't give them the break they deserved.
1400034779|5.0|The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, first published in 1998, is the first in Alexander McCall Smith's acclaimed Botswana series. Precious Ramotswe is the lady detective behind the book's title. She opened her agency with money inherited from her father, Obed Ramotswe. In this first installment we learn about Obed's life--he worked for years in South Africa's mines, saved his money, and later invested in cattle--and also about Mma Ramotswe's early history. (\\"Mma,\\"pronounced \\"mah,\\" is a term of respect that appears throughout the book.) She grew up in Mochudi, raised by her father and a cousin. Against her father's wishes she leapt into an unhappy marriage that left her alone and grieving her only child's death in infancy. It's an unhappy chapter in Mma Ramotswe's life, but it packs meat onto her character: she is not all homespun goodness, that is, but was capable in her youth of great folly, and what wisdom she has was hard won. The book offers an account of Mma Ramotswe's earliest cases, which she solves with legwork and good sense and the occasional help of her friends, in particular Mr. J.L.B. Maketoni, the proprietor of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. Mma Ramotswe is not the sort of detective one calls upon to solve grand crimes, but neither are all of her cases trivial. In addition to dealing with a client's wayward daughter, for example, and a doctor's worry about his colleague's competency, she is concerned throughout this book with the case of a missing eleven-year-old boy. The story of his disappearance and of her involvement in the case is woven throughout the book.<br /><br />McCall Smith's series is not plot-driven. Mma Ramotswe's cases give the books their framework, but the focus is on Mma Ramotswe's character and on the country of Botswana itself: the setting of McCall Smith's books is at least as important to the stories as his protagonist. But although one doesn't think of the books primarily as mysteries, they are in fact good cozies, so the books can be enjoyed on that score as well.<br /><br />If you haven't yet stumbled on McCall Smith's series, you have yet to experience the singular joy of slipping into Mma Ramotswe's world. There is something soothing about the experience, and I'm not sure how the author achieves this magic: the simplicity of his language, perhaps, or of his characters' ethos. At any rate, the books are a pleasure to be savored.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamelbe enjoyed on that score as well.<br /><br />If you haven't yet stumbled on McCall Smith's series, you have yet to experience the singular joy of slipping into Mma Ramotswe's world.

1594489505|5.0|I have read hundreds of book in all categories but I have to say this was by far one of the best I have ever read. I could not put it down once I started. It made me cry, laugh and wonder about my own life in ways I have never thought of before. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B000W4KT64|4.0|I really have made a pastime out of hating John Travolta.  Something about him always rubbed the wrong way.  Well, I'm happy to eat crow over this movie.  It's energetic, hilarious, and a natural mood elevator.  Mr. Travolta is hysterically funny, and it's nice to see Christopher Walken in a comic role. The songs are not THAT memorable, but it's impossible to not be sucked in.  Nikki Blonsky is an absolute delight.  My daughter was naturally drawn to the Zac Efron factor, but there's a good message about standing up for what you believe in.    My only beef is the casting of Michelle Pfeiffer.  She was appropriate in her acting role, but she really is a very average singer.    And for the record, I will hate John Revolting no more!
0446577391|1.0|in his book HOW TO WRITE A THRILLER larry beihart notes that an author loses all credibility with a reader when he makes egregious factual errors.  aside from his hillbilly grammar [characters are always taking 'ahold of' things and 'trying and' instead of 'trying to'], baldacci is blithely unaware of the meanings of many words he uses.  the most grating, and gratuitious, of such errors is his use of the term CPU. in more than one section of the book, baldacci clearly describes a CPU as the metal box housing a desktop computer. this is generally called the 'chassis'.  google comes up with some 30-40 definitions of 'CPU'.  in all instances they agree: it is the computer chip, the tiny square of silicon also known as the 'central processing unit'.  how in hell could the author not know that?    that he doesn't, makes me wonder.  i cannot subsequently read with any conviction anything else he writes, especially about technology or science.    but really, anyone can make a mistake. where are all the editors and proofreaders and friends of the author. it is impossible they are all so stupid as not to know what a CPU is!    what it means is they just skimmed the book.  i think we are owed more than that.

B000006TRV|2.0|...why so many people love this album so much. I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan but this album doesn't rate as a great album, let alone a great Floyd album.  I can't think of a Pink Floyd album much worse than this.  Nothing really than Roger Waters wailing and whining about stupid B.S.  The lyrics are very uninspiring.  While there are a couple of songs on here worth listening to there just is not enough to warrant listening to this entire album. Don't let someone fool you into thinking this album is anything special.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|I remember hearing that the new Spider-Man 3 movie wasn't that great, a lot of people complained that Peter Parker goes \\"emo\\" and ruined the movie.  Quite frankly, I thought that that part fit quite nicely, it was the rest of the movie that drove me crazy.  First problem was that the creators of this movie didn't think to much past their own glory for special effects (in my opinion) and decided the movie would be incredible if they threw in 3 villains.  Venom, Green Goblin Jr., and Sandman.  Mistake #1 was just right there.  Too many plots were going on, and it made the movie very incomplete and even cheesy.  They tried to break too many relationships and re-mend them with little possible resolve.  Sandman's story never finished, which was pretty annoying, but he also just added too much to the story that shouldn't have been there.  Green Goblin Jr. would've worked but his frenzy in general was too short and the fight scene in my opinion wasn't even that great.  The other thing that drove me absolutely crazy was how Mr. Spider-man suddenly becomes all popular and they introduce unnecessary characters for this whole \\"city key\\" fiasco that didn't work to productive cause.  The only plus this movie had from bombing was Venom, which sadly wasn't the center of the movie like it should have been. Venom doesn't even happen till half way through the movie, and that just caused problems.  So in short, this was a terrible sequel and is actually a movie I don't care for and probably won't watch again. 2 out of 5 rating, it had a little bit of goodness, but very, very little.
B000XB5WHW|5.0|The two new songs, \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Centerfold\\" is as amazing as only P!nk can make music!!  If you don't own this copy yet, you are sorely missing out!  The dvd is also a hoot to watch, she is as real as always with the original P!nk humor mixed into it!!  Fantastic and rocking is a understatement!!
B0010ZR160|5.0|This movie really knocked me out!!!  Casey Affleck was awesome. The whole story was extremely powerful. I didn't expect to be so moved.  The layers of this situation were so clearly shown.  It is such a tough situation and the answers are so unanswerable.  It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that has affected me so deeply.  There are situations in our society that seem to be wrong in the USA; but these are the situations we must face and, more importantly, find solutions to.  It is all too big, too awful, too real.
B00006AUIG|4.0|I first heard about this film by catching the end of an episode of Ebert & Roper. Roper recommended it and Ebert hated it, which usually means that I would love it. I had forgotten the name of the film and it all but left my memory until, while home on college break a few years ago, I caught it in the middle of the night on Showtime. \\"Oh yeah. This is that movie. Nothing else is on, so I might as well watch it.\\" I am so glad I did, and especially at that time! This was one of the best movie experiences I've ever had. Alone in the dark, and just on the brink of tired. Nothing will ever compare to that first time I saw it, but upon the subsequent viewings the film has still held up. The film, however, is certainly not for everyone. SESSION 9 typifies a narrative style that turns a good chunk of its audience off almost immediately. The film is not on the level of TIDELAND in its mystery and off-beat pacing, but it is along the same lines. We live in a \\"what have you done for me lately\\" society that has little patience for a film that demands attention with something other than pop and dazzle. SESSION 9 is a refreshing change and proves that the modern horror movie need not rely on blood spatter and boobies to be effective and noteworthy. Yeah. I'm looking at you HOSTEL.
6305907145|4.0|When you sit down to watch this film, I suggest you rename it in your head. Think of it as being entirely unrelated to the Jane Austen novel and you'll certainly enjoy it. What you absolutely must not do is look for a film that captures Austen's caustic sarcasm or, indeed, most of her novel \\"Mansfield Park.\\"     Personally, I really do love this film, but only when I'm keeping it separate from Austen's masterpiece. The main problem with this film can be summed up in one person: writer/director Patricia Rozema. What she thought she was doing to the classic novel, I have no idea. She has changed the characters considerably: Fanny, who is shy and timid in the novel, becomes a courageous writer with a sarcastic wit; her uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram becomes an odious man with the intention of trading her off into marriage the same way he trades his slaves; her cousin Tom, rather than living unaware of the needs of anyone else, spends his time balancing between being in a drunken stupor and arguing with his father on behalf of their slaves; her aunt, Lady Bertram, is addictied to opium; and her Aunt Norris is not nearly so snide as in the book. Worst of all, I think, is the complete omission of William, fanny's brother and best friend. Rozema also has given the relationship between Fanny and Mary Crawford an air of lesbianism, which irritated me a great deal. (Rozema says in her commentary that the two scenes which give that feeling were born of Austen's comment on the \\"fascination of their relationship,\\" though, having read the novel, I can assure you that nothing of the sort is even slightly hinted at.)    The worst flaw in Rozema's film, though, is undoubtedly her commentary on slavery. The audience is basically force fed constant, and sometimes very graphic reminders of where the Bertram's wealth is coming from. The whole slavery subplot detracts from the main story and seems to be more of a shock tactic than anything else.    Luckily, the film has some redeeming qualities in its cast. Hugh Bonneville and Victoria Hamilton are perfect as the absurd Mr. Rushworth and the obnoxiously self-centered Maria. Frances O'Connor is a charming heroine, and the way in which Rozema utilized lines straight from Austen's letters and journals as Fanny's speech gives the audience a chance to place Jane Austen as the heroine of Mansfield Park, as well as granting us a rare chance to hear more examples of her sharp wit.    So, keep it separate from the book, try not to get lost by the slavery subplot, sit back and enjoy an otherwise beautiful film!
B00005R24K|4.0|You know a movie is popular when it has its own website ([...]). First, the special features on this particular DVD are worth the price of admission themselves. In addition to outtakes and a \\"making of..\\" feature, you get two versions of commentary: one with director Sam Raimi and producer Rob Tapert, and the other with star Bruce Campbell. The commentaries are great, because not only do you appreciate the making of the film more, but the three commentators tease each other and generally clown their way through the commentary.    The movie. The plot is not that original: teenagers go into woods, find strange book, awaken evil spirits, get possessed by demons, etc. What's notable about this movie is the over-the-top, creative gore effects that were way ahead of their time. Considering that the film was made on a shoestring budget, Raimi and the others did a great job. In low-budget gems like this, you can really appreciate how simple things such as camera angles, props, and other plot devices add to the mood and the story. And the mood is great: fog machines, sound effects, wind, etc, all cheaply done but combine to create a great creepy atmosphere.   A must-have for the horror afficianado.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|A funny little Irish film on the birth and delivery of a music group and an album. It is the result of the chance meeting of a young guitar player singing in the street and a young pianist and slightly composer just passing by and listening. The meeting of the two, though starting on a bad foot: ten cents in the street for one full song and later his more than lame proposal though he knew nothing about her. He will learn later she is Czech, married, has a child and is living in Ireland with her mother and her child waiting for her husband to join them. In spite of that a collaboration becomes possible and a full CD is composed, rehearsed, recorded and burnt in time for him to go to London to work with some producers. He invites her on his last night in Ireland and she accepts but will not come and his only farewell will come from his father. On the following morning he goes away but stops in a music store and has a piano delivered to her. End of story: the piano is delivered and used with the finally arrived husband. Charming story in which artistic gifts and desires are not always expressed, do not always find their way to some audience, and may be completely wrecked by some horny or kinky illumination. But when art leads beyond this skin deep impulse there can be a way to some achievement. In many ways a good Irish hence catholic film in which Catholicism is some kind of morality that leads to a certain life style.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I'm a huge TV watcher and It's safe to say that this is my favorite TV series ever. There is just so much heart and drama between the characters that this is a show worth watching.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|out of all the princess movies, this is the best. truly a magical tale, that will never get old. it's an unforgettable story and takes you on a whole different ride. it's a classic that is a must have. a breathtaking fairytale that is just outstanding and a fine piece of work. they outdid themselves on this one for real. beauty and the beast, a tale of a girl who lives with her father. one day he is captured by a beast who lives in a secluded castle. he is taken as prisoner, and when his daughter, belle, finds out runs to his rescue. she asks the beast for mercy and that she will take her fathers place in return for his freedom. he agrees, and through that journey comes hope, discoveries, and adventure. she realizes that there is more to the beast than meets the eye, and he discovers that it's okay to open your heart. he lives in an enchanted castle and he and everyone in it is under a spell that only true love can break. belle is their hope, and love can not be forced, so if it is to happen it will come pure from heart. but as always where there is love there is jealousy and hate. in comes the awful gaston, who wants belle as his own, and will kill the beast in order to keep her and sooth his bruised ego. but evil never triumphs, and this is just another example of that. you get so involved in the film that you are just rooting for a happy ending. then it touches you on an emotional level, like few others have. very exciting, and a joy for kids and adults alike. both the movie and the extras are great. if you have not seen it then you must. in no way anything else than a great time, and a story worth telling over and over again.

B000002KET|4.0|This album reminds me of Sabotage, in that it has a very heavy prog rock feel to it.  Some Sabbath fans don't really dig this one, as they feel that it's too complex and not really Sabbath.  This isn't true at all.  A lot of early Sabbath album had long, complex tracks to them (Warning, on their first album, ran 10 1/2 minutes), and this album is just another example of our good friends John (aka Ozzy), Terrence, Tony, and Wiliam expanding their musical repetroire.  The song A National Acrobat (a prog title if there was ever one) is a great song, with a great closing 2 minutes that may be the most complex music Sabbath ever played.  The title track is fantastic, a true Sabbath classic.  Fluff is anything but, another underrated gem from Sabbath.  Sabbra Cadabra is another great one, one that Metallica (another band that gets flak from fans for changing) covered on their excellent Garage, Inc. album.  One quip, though.  The sound is muddy on this recording.  I don't know if this was deliberate or just bad remastering, but it doesn't detract too much from the music.  If you are a Sabbath fan, you can't do without with this one.
B000UR9TPK|5.0|This is still one of the best concert films ever made, one that holds up to repeated viewing not only for the quality of the performance but the narrative of the film.  While the fantasy sequences and photographic embellishments may seem kitschy to some, they hold up remarkably well, adding a mythic dimension to the music.<br /><br />This was the film that made me a Led Zeppelin fan, and it's great to have it on Blu-Ray.  The video is astonishingly good for a film of this vintage.  There's grain in some of the outdoor footage, probably due to its having been shot with cheap equipment.  Overall, the colors are bright, vivid and crisp, and the picture is razor-sharp.  The Dolby TrueHD soundtrack will knock your socks off.  Wait till the neighbors are out and crank it up!
B00005JPTI|4.0|Give the Oscar to Will Smith, but send his little daughter to acting school!  I thought I had seen the bottom of the Smith barrel when Jaden lit up the screen in last year's homeless but not hopeless saga THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, but I had not reckoned that Will would put little Willow into a movie where vampires smash into limo windows trying to eat her!  Well, better her than another more impressionable child actor I guess.  Is this how Peter and Jane Fonda started out, widenings in their dad's demographic?  The little white boy who arrives in the present day is nothing to write home about however.  They never did explain to me where he'd come from, just told him to keep shuffling his food across his plate, from one end to the other, over and over, in an attempt to suggest some of the post traumatic stress of spending whole days with Alice Braga, niece of veteran Brazilian bombshell Sonia Braga, sadly missed in these days of \\"the next generation.\\"<br /><br />More importantly the movie delivers plenty of action and suspense, till the last third where it all goes down the drain.  Director Francis Lawrence gets a wrenching performance out of his star, and the designers convincingly show us an apocalyptic and haunted, lonely New York, something Leonard Bernstein might have written symphonies about.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />Hate the emphasis on church in the picture, as the last reels dissolve into a debate between Will Smith and Alice Braga about does God exist or is He just an illusion or worse, out to get us.<br /><br />It was all very well in THE VILLAGE, but why repeat it here in the closing shots of I AM LEGEND.  Why do we have to see that church steeple, is it supposed to make us feel, OK, we're in good hands now?  Even in THE NEW WORLD, when John Smith returns to Jamestown and sees everyone dying of hunger, the church steeple is broken and battered.  Do the vampires of I AM LEGEND respect crucifixes the way vampires in Hammer horror do?  I wonder.  Maybe something of this atavistic belief survives into the present era of post-28 DAYS LATER laterness.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|My 4 year old wanted this movie - he loves Spiderman.  He has watched it several times already, and enjoys the movie.  I wasn't impressed with it...I thought it was kind of cheesey, had too many villains and too much story line crammed into one movie.  Glad I didn't waste my money at the theater for this one.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I've seen Tekkonkinkreet three times and I'll tell you why. It successfully captures the essence of the manga it is based on. Character development is in debth. The psychological aspects rival Hitchcock. Yin-Yang symbolisms are woven throughout the story, which seemingly ebs and flows with a superbly written and produced soundtrack. And the animation . . . well, you've got to see it three times to fully capture and appreciate the exquisite breadth, beauty and detail of the art.<br /><br />If this isn't impressive enough, this is the director's debut. Of course he had the help of some of the very best producers in Japan; but to successfully convey ideas and orchestrate the hundreds of artists necessary to complete this project under a tight schedule, for even an experienced director, is nothing short of amazing.<br /><br />For the few who were bored and gave the movie less than 4 stars, it is understandable. Great art is never appreciated by all. But if you are in the mood for something more than just a simple action packed cartoon or cutesie CGI insect story, if you crave visual and mental stimulation with deep and sometimes disturbing subject matter, see Tekkonkinkreet with the original voice and English subtitles . . . more than once.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I won't bother writing a long, sprawling review. All I have to say is that In Rainbows is excellent. I got chills today when I listened to it while reading the lyric booklet.

B000002UAR|4.0|Currently, I am studying this album in my Modern Music: Production and Analysis class. This album has a mixture of very good songs and mediocre ones. Personally, I think songs like Love You To just sound like a hodgepodge of musical instruments thrown together. However, their experimental nature did break new grounds in rock, like in Got To Get You Into My Life. They also do very subtle things such as not playing the last chord in For No One. Eleanor Rigby's stinging strings were perfect for the song, and emphasized the song well. The overall shortness of the songs makes the listener begging for more, as the songs are only about an average of 2:10 mins long. The shortness also allows the CD for some short pleasure listening, as not one song goes on forever and ever - as some songs tend to do. Do I think the songs would be as good if they were longer? Probably not. The very fact that they leave the song at its height is a good way of raising the stock of the songs. It's almost like a great sports player retiring at his prime - he is forever immortalized. Other than a few songs such as the ones I mentioned, this is overall a good album, and I cannot refute the fact that this is indeed an important album in The Beatles' career.

0143036556|3.0|In this follow-up to his Pulitzer Prize-winning Guns, Germs, and Steel (which I have not read), Jared Diamond attempts to examine and explain why certain ancient societies such as the American Anasazi, Mayans and Easter Island collapsed.  He poses the theory that there are essentially five factors in a societial collapse, although not all are always present:  1) environmental, 2) climatic, 3) warfare, isolation, and how the society responds to hardship.  Nothing new or earth-shattering, but very interesting to look at in the detail Diamond gives.  I thought he was a little high-handed at times and I could have done without his many nostalgic stories about fishing with his grandfather in Montana, but it was interesting all the same.  I won't delve into it much more than that because this book has been reviewed to death!  It's interesting for any history, sociology or anthropology buff, certainly.
B000Q79HS8|4.0|The Bourne series has all been great. And if you haven't seen the movies prior to this, it doesn't take very long to catch on to what's happening.

0765318741|4.0|I bought this a few months ago, before the movie came out, although it had been on my wish list forever.  I read Hell House years ago and it was one of my favorite horror novels, so I've wanted to read I Am Legend for a long time.  I read it before the movie came out, but the movie was so different that it really didn't matter.  The book was written in the early 1950's and I think it was pretty innovative for that time.  Apparently it was first marketed as sci-fi, and only later became known as a horror classic.<br /><br />Robert Neville is - he believes - the sole survivor of some kind of worldwide plague that has killed off most of humanity, and doomed a small portion of it to a vampiric, raging, bloodthirsty existence.  For some reason Robert is immune to the disease for reasons he doesn't understand, and everyone he ever knew and loved is either dead or stalking him.  The atmosphere is very tense right from the beginning, when we're introduced to the horrible simplicity of Robert's everyday survival:  wake up, re-fortify the protections on his house, go out and hunt for supplies, kill a few vampires to lessen their appalling numbers, get home before sundown, eat from his dwindling food supplies, and then wait, with dread and fear, until nightfall when the others come and torment him from outside, all night long.  His alone-ness is stark and terrifying, and you feel the kind of deadened desperation he must live with as someone who has nothing to live for, yet can't allow himself to die.<br /><br />The book is very short - a novella, really - and ends much more ambiguously than the the movie.  Even if you've seen the movie, I recommend the book.  It has quite a different feel to it.
0316010669|4.0|(Helpful? Not? Please vote, so I know someone is reading these :^) I have now enjoyed both of Gladwell's books.  Blink is quite a bit better annotated and organized than the first, IMHO, and though the last couple of chapters seemed a bit disjunct, he managed to tie it all back together (though a bit abruptly).  I'd say, it's not a treatise on instantaneous perceptions, but is a good all around view of several issues surrounding the snap judgments we all make every day.  \\"Blink\\" dissected what I'd call subconscious cognition (if that's not a nonsense term), and started me thinking about the more minute details or sub-sections of the phenomenon.  A nice example of this was his discussion of professional food tasters.  Who'd have thought there would be a 10-pt scale for a dozen different measures of food texture, all contributing to the final texture rating?!? Slipperiness ... Crispiness ... and so on.  This only to illustrate that experts have a different view into things than you and I.  This is loosely true of each of thousands of professions, so it gets one to thinking about all that specialized knowledge out there that leads one person to make a different snap decision than another.<br /><br />I think that this might be a good jumping off point for several areas of continued reading. I was particularly intrigued by the sections about facial expressions, and how cops \\"remember\\" a shooting incident. How parts of our mental abilities can shut down, and how others can heighten involuntarily.  I can't say \\"Blink\\" is the kind of treatment of the subject that would be called exhaustive, or overly scientific, but Gladwell includes plenty of statistics, correlating facts and annotations for further exploration. As I said, it's a fun read, and also a good jumping off point as well. You can consume this book easily in a couple of sittings, and I think you'll enjoy it.
1593081545|4.0|I think this is my favorite Jane Austen book so far, although I still have Persuasion and Northanger Abbey to read.  Most Austen fans would not count Mansfield Park as a favorite, though, at least from what I've heard.  It's not that it's a profoundly different book from the more popular Pride & Prejudice or Sense & Sensibility, but many people seem to dislike the main character, or at least are not as impressed by her, as by P&P's Elizabeth Bennet or Emma's Emma Woodhouse.  It's true that Fanny Price is a very different heroine than Lizzy or Emma, but her circumstances are profoundly different, too.  She doesn't have Lizzy's spunk or Emma's forthrightness, but Lizzy and Emma both have the advantage of being more secure in their surroundings, both financially and emotionally.  Fanny has a lot working against her from the start.<br /><br />A generation before Fanny's birth, three sisters chose their paths of marriage:  one to a respectable parson, one to a wealthy landowner, and the other to a basically worthless sloth.  Fanny had the misfortune to be one of the numerous products of the latter.  Her aunt, Mrs. Norris (married to the parson), convinces their other sister, the wealthy Mrs. Bertram, to take Fanny in as a ward.  While this sounds like a kindness, it's really only an ego booster for Mrs. Norris.  She has no love for Fanny and from the day the poor girl comes to live with the Bertrams at Mansfield Park, she is never allowed to forget that she is the beneficiary of charity and should grovel, beg and prove her gratitude every waking second.  Not only are there constant verbal reminders from her aunts, uncle and cousins, but Fanny's status as a poor relation is made clear by her clothing, her rooms, the social functions she's allowed to attend (or not), and even whether or not she has a horse to ride.  It's not that anyone is outwardly unkind to Fanny (except Mrs. Norris, at times)  per se; she's just a non-entity entirely dependent on the whims of her superior relations, and she's always painfully aware of it.<br /><br />The main event is the arrival of Henry and Mary Crawford, a brother and sister who proceed to turn things topsy-turvy in the circle of families around Mansfield Park with their somewhat laissez-faire, urban view on the rituals of courtship.  The bittersweet backdrop to all this entanglement and game-playing is Fanny's genuine, unrequited love for her cousin Edmund, one of the few people who treat her as an equal.  Other reviewers have expressed disdain and frustration with Fanny, labeling her a boring, moralistic, judgmental prig, but I didn't feel that way about her at all.  I felt she handled herself and her situation the best she could, and the fact that she's a plain, ordinary girl with none of Elizabeth Bennet's wit or Emma Woodhouse's beauty only makes her more human to me.  I enjoyed it and will definitely read it again.
B0000027RL|5.0|Eddie Vedder is truly an amazing vocalist. This album, along with Nirvana's Nevermind and Red Hot Chili Peppers' Blood Sugar Sex Magik are in my opinion the best albums of the last decade and some of the best ever. They all have brilliant original song writing, expert instrumentals and unique, highly skilled vocals. The only improvement would be high resolution surround sound on DVD-A, SACD or some future format.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|We totally enjoyed the PBS special but when we found the New Journey CD we were very disappointed to find Spanish Lady was not one of the ones they put on it.  We were very happy to find it had been added tothe Deluxe Package and couldn't wait to get it.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|[[ASIN:B000PFU7OO Once]]    This CD is FANTASTIC.  I haven't been bowled over by pop music in a long time.  The emotion that Glen puts into his singing is incredible.  His voice does not need to be carried by a lot of technical back-ground stuff like a lot of singers today.
0061547832|1.0|A book full of redundant inspirational advice. Good advice, but nothing new, just affirmations of all those things we already know. Did he mention the wonderful Trump Towers? Oh yeah,about 28 times.     Donald mentioned that he has been able to date (screw) many beautiful women. Does he think that the world doesn't know he gets a piece from the women he's dated?     We get it. Unlike Donald, who doesn't seem to get it, he actually said that he doesn't know what he's got that has the beautiful women so attracted to him. Donald- It may be a shock, but your attraction is-YOUR MONEY.     If someone that clueless can make millions, we all have a chance, with or without a rich father in the business. Donald has more than he will even need but he just doesn't get \\"it\\", and probably never will.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|The storyline is one that I can say I'll love for years. It takes me back to the old school fairy tales of the 80s, where it was more for adults than children, and made you think. It's adventurous, romantic, silly, and holds itself well. The only thing I wish they had kept in was the extended ending they showed in the deleted scenes. They would've been great to actually see.    The acting was very well done, very to how a story like that would run. I'm not a big fan of Claire Danes AT ALL but I have to admit, she was able to hold her accent pretty well, and played her roll well. Michelle Phieffer was amazing! I've always loved her, and even though for most of the film she was supposed to be ugly, she was still beautiful. Robert De Niro was soo funny! I love his character!    The visuals were beautiful, and realistic. Very well animated or placed.    Overall, a very well created and presented film!
B000FL7CAK|1.0|I am very disappointed.  I have always ordered new or like new items from you guys and have always been satisfied.  Recently I ordered veronica mars season 2 and the first disc skips throughout the entire disc.  It is very disappointing because the discs were not for me, but for my mom.  I am sure there is nothing you can or will do, but I just felt the need to inform you.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I was a bit sceptical when my girlfriend ordered this film on Netflix for us to watch thinking it was just going to be a complete \\"chick flick\\" but it was absolutely wonderful.  It's not a \\"chick flick\\", it's an \\"Amature Musicans Flick\\".  The film is so true to life about the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of an amature musicians who is just writing and singing from the heart.  Especially if you've been severely hurt by a significant other as I have, so I could very much identify with Guy's lyrics as they are very true to the heart.  There are three main reasons this film is incredible.    1) The music.  Simply put, the song writing in this film is incredible.  Being a musican myself, I understand how the music industry works (been offered more than one record deal so I'm no stranger to the industry) and I don't see these songs as selling out stadiums, but rather having a strong underground following like a Dunkan Sheik.  The songs are from the heart and very authentic.  At first I thought the lyrics were toying with being cliche, but they are put together in a manor that they don't quite cross over and actually end up being quite amazing.  They convey real feelings and real emotions in a way that is accessible for the veiwer to identify with and make them personal to their own experience.  For the true musician, music is life and lyrics are your soul.  I was moved to tears in the scene where the two main characters are in the music shop playing their first song together.  Not only is it amazing to hear how they come together but the lyrics to the song truly hit home.  All in all, great song writing and arangement.    2) True to life interaction.  The interaction between the two main characters is incredibly real to life.  I had something similar happen to me with a girl that just heard me playing/singing one day and we were inseprable for a short period of time playing music together and what not.  When you have the bond of music, it's a different type of interaction.  It's like you truly know someone and can see their soul.  You see that in the interaction between these two.  No secrets because you know that they won't hurt you.  It's just incredible and I think this film really captured that.    3) The ending.  The film truly leaves you wanting.  I won't say how it ends for those who haven't seen it, but the ending is true to what probably would happen in real life and it leaves you with such mixed emotions.    Definately a must see.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|I've always been a fan of musicals, but the first HSM movie was one I was determined to avoid. It looked overzealous and juvenile. But then they made a sequel: HSM2. It still looked silly, but I figured it couldn't hurt to have it on in the background as I studied. Forget that idea: I was hooked within a minute of the first musical number right at the beginning. I rewound the DVR and called my roomate in frantically. We spent the rest of the night in rapt attention of one of the most catchy, well-choreographed musicals I've ever seen. Now the plot isn't exactly epic, but the acting, dancing, and singing is just superb.<br /><br />In the sequel, Ryan, Troy, and Gabriella's characters are expanded greatly. We don't see much more of Sharpay, Chad, Taylor, Kelsi, Martha or Jason than we saw in the first movie, other than various music numbers and brief appearances. Gabriella breaks out of her shy persona and boldly addresses some deep issues in her relationships with Troy and Sharpay - she also befriends Ryan, who in turn is developed as his own person away from Sharpay's image. He briefly assumes Troy's role in various aspects, and befriends the Wildcats. Meanwhile, Troy tosses various ideas around in his head about what his goals and ambitions are, and what he finds important in life. He adopts a few different personality changes throughout the movie, which leads to his alienating his friends. But in the end, with some help, Troy gets back on track with his life with a new outlook on himself, his friends, and his future.<br /><br />The DVD extras are enertaining, though they could have used more backstage footage (which they're likely saving for a rerelease). You can find HSM2 in a Wal-Mart special 2-pack that comes with bonus features unavailable in other stores. This Wal-Mart exlusive bonus disc includes: The Making of a Music Scene ('Gotta Go My Own Way'); Crazy Cast Questions (excl. Zac); Anatomy of a Dance Number ('What Time Is It?' - this one was fun to watch!); and a Phineas And Ferb Bonus episode.And Ferb Bonus episode.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I bought this in HD for my husband as a Christmas present and it has been something our whole family can enjoy together!  Our 7, 3, & 4 month old all loved the larger than life images and they were able to learn from it as well.  The time & care the filmmakers took in making this was truely an epic adventure.  One of my best buys this holiday season!
B000MR9D5E|3.0|This is a fascinating DVD. Well put together, to be certain. It must've taken years to film. The producers did all they could to abstain from mentioning America, as if there's nothing really interesting going on in the USA. Filmed well but became preachy at the end (disc 5).  Also, the series often repeats itself throughout.  For example, the same talking heads appeared on every disk, reminding us how valuable resources were and how terrible the Americans were for not doing more.  OK, that was my opinion.  Bonus material at the end of each disk on how they captured the shots was spectacular. Worth it if you buy it half-price and skip the last disk.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I did not receive this game as a gift nor do I own it. I played this game with my sister and her children (8, 10, and 12) and still found it entertaining as well as educational. It is not a long-playing game, and is quite addictive. Even though it is a four-player game, it can be easily played by two people. A great game for the entire family!
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I am a grandmother and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this with my grandchildren.  Disney is the best!!!
B000RC2EH8|3.0|I vaguely remember having the April action figure when I was younger, when she incorrect, dressed in a yellow jumpsuit? Or something yellow anyway? After much thought, I realised the only reason I had her was because my neighbours grandsons had the rest of the figurines, and I wanted to 'play' with them. Why they put up with me, I have no idea, I was a lonely little girl, who didn't have any friends, and they were probably teenagers at the time.<br /><br />I have no recollection of watching the turtles I was young. I probably did at some point, but I don't think I watched it avidly, or anything like that. In fact, in a recent question & answer session (before watching this of course!) I could only name two of the turtles - Leonardo & Raphael. I couldn't even remember Splinter!<br /><br />But enough of my rambling, my opinion on the film was yes it was good, considering I had no idea what was going on a lot of the time. I thought the effects were excellent, and what made the film a lot different from other animation movies, I couldn't place the 'celebrity' voices in it. Which makes a change. (Just in case you were curious, some of them included Patrick Stewart, Lawrence Fishburne, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Chris Evans.)<br /><br />The turtles were smart - I don't have a favourite, and I don't think I could tell you right now which one was which (possibly!), they were funny, and they each had their own special weapons. I think if I'm thinking of the correct one, I liked Raphael (or Leonardo), cos they had those two knives.<br /><br />Are there a lot of hardcore disappointed fans out there? If there is, you're way too hardcore. Hey, according to someone special, my figurine of April was way wrong, if you go by the comics. But there's a lot of different fans out there - you've got fans of the comics, fans of the original TV shows, etc, who do you disappoint first? This must be a very difficult movie if they'd even brought that into consideration. I wouldn't want a bunch of die hard fans on my case if I was the director. But then he's probably just after the paycheck.<br /><br />I can't really say I'm going to become a die hard fan of the Turtles anytime soon. It was a perfectly good animation movie, considering I was slightly wary of it to begin with, and this is the kinda film that needs to be respected, rather than the Shreks of the film world these days. Make more of these, maybe you'll get a new fan. Or maybe not! Hahaha.f I was the director. But then he's probably just after the paycheck.

B00006AVRK|5.0|As superb as I remembered them from PBS.  The sets are sumptuous and no body dresses better than \\"Bertie\\" - with a bit of a nudge from Jeeves.  The slap dash delimas are spirited enough to lift you into a world long gone, but one we all would have loved to inhabit. Laurie is deliciously dense to Fry's splendidly sensible, ever resourseful Jeeves. These two actors make Wooster and Jeeves their own. My highest recomendations. The audios of all PG Wodehouse works are a pure treat as well.    Prompt delivery was gretly appreciated!
B0006L16N8|2.0|This could have been a great album but the mastering is unbelievably bad.   The drummer could have a set of rolled up carpets and a stick as a drum kit; you wouldn't be able to tell, as all the drums are a dull thud, and cymbal work is almost inaudible. It's a muddy wall of sound.    If they turned the compression up any higher you would just be left with a constant 2 KHz sine wave.    I suspect the earlier Coldplay albums dont suffer from this problem as much, but based on my experience this is one worth avoiding.
B000SUKPKM|4.0|Greatest Hits albums, I have always argued, really only serve one purpose, and it has nothing to do with pleasing die hard fans of the artist.  Die hard fans should already own most of the albums and typically they have found their way to deeper cuts that they argue are just as good as, if not better than, the radio staples they have heard a thousand times and the uninitiated and hit-friendly fans are familiar with.  Those uninitiated are the people greatest hits albums are geared towards; those who like several songs they have heard, but they have never been overwhelmed by the music to the point of seeking out all (if any) of the band's albums (much less see them live or learn much about them and their history).  Anyone looking to truly really learn about an artist generally can't do it with a greatest hits album (Dylan, Springsteen, Petty - the list goes on - are all legends who have been grossly under-represented by their single-disc greatest hits collections in terms of what their legend is really all about compared with their radio-friendly hits).  And in this age of itunes and downloads, hits albums don't matter much anyway since most can obtain whatever singles they like online.    Now, when it comes to artists I am passionate about, I am something of a snob about greatest hits albums, arguing that people should not be a slave to what the radio or record company tells them is essential because they will be missing out on an entire history of the artists' great music.  But I am hypocritical in the sense that, when it comes to a band I kinda like, but don't care that much about, I seek out a streamlined overview of their biggest stuff (and even then I often don't care about half the tracks included - again, this is where downloading comes in handy, but being something of a music snob, as I said, I like to buy actual CDs).  For me, several big 90s bands, like Matchbox 20 and The Goo Goo Dolls fall into this category.  I like some of their songs fine, but neverenough to buy any of their full albums.  I know, I know, fans of these groups will tell me I am missing out on so much better stuff, and as a fan, they are probably right.  I would be saying the same thing if you told me all you needed from Springsteen or Billy Joel was a greatest hits CD.  They are so much more than that.  And there is bound to be that argument for the Goo as well.  But you can't convert everybody.  Just as not everyone is willing to move beyond the Boss's singles, the Goo Goo Dolls are a band I just have not been moved to explore.  Or even buy anything from.  But about them and a few others (Matchbox, Collective Soul, etc.), I said would like to pick up a greatest hits album some day, just to have a few of those songs I have enjoyed over the years.    This album is a great example of a greatest hits album that get that job done.  People have their complaints about what it is lacking, and I'm sure they are totally correct, but the truth is, there is probably even more here than someone like myself approaching this as something of a novelty even needs.  Yeah these were all hits, and most will be familiar with all the tunes here, but there are only a select few I care to own and will get repeat listening from me.  See, that's the kind of person these albums benefit.  I have nothing against the Goo, I have actually seen them live several times opening for Bon Jovi and I am familiar with both their punk sound and their mainstream stuff, but none of that has made me into a fane.  My loss I'm sure, but for any who feel the way I do, this album will be perfect.    A lot of people here seem to take issue with the exclusion of at least 2 tracks:  the original version of \\"Name\\" and the Goo's cover of \\"Give a Little Bit\\" (longtime fans will mention five or so others as well).  Though I agree, given its radio-staple status, \\"Give a Little Bit\\" should be included here just for the sake of staying true to representing all the actual hits on a greatest hits album(doesn't there always seem to be one or two big hits oddly left off these compilations?), I have never been a fan of that song - either the original Supertramp version or the Goo's.  The song has always sounded so bland to me and the Goo's straight-forward cover is almost identical.  But that's just me; just because I don't miss it, my opinion of the song aside, it should be here.  My suggestion for others like me who don't pledge allegiance to the Goo, but do enjoy and want to own their biggest hits, buy this CD and download the original \\"Name\\" and \\"Give a Little Bit\\".    There is, of course, the chance that, if someone buys a hits album and loves it enough to listen to it over and over again, it will get them to seek out other albums, or learn more about the band and discover which cuts fans suggest are the best.  This is another benefit of hit compilations and why they are more valuable than some fans who are upset about certain song exclusions give them credit for.    There is one more benefit to these sparse compilations:  Even though they give listeners just the briefest, skimming-the-surface overview of the artists, sometimes they work great as a CD to throw on when you just want a bunch of songs that you know really well and sound really good.  Even some artists I am a die hard fan of have a single disc hits compilation that ignores a tone of good stuff, and I would never tell anyone looking to explore or \\"get into\\" the artists to substitute for several of their classic albums, but they work great as way to get a fix of a lot of great music in one place.  Steely Dan, Prince, Aerosmith all have jam packed one-disc-ers that are lacking, but still sound and work great given what's there. Now we can add the Goo Goo Dolls to that list.  For that type of compilation, this one works great.  Sometimes it's not about what's missing, but rather what's included.  And this is a case where the band has been around long enough and had enough hits that everything includedhere is all good stuff.    This is a compilation I have wanted for a while.  Not that I was waiting on pins and needles or anything, but I always said they should put something like this out (almost every other artist on the planet has some form of greatest hits).  For anyone who thinks of this band the way I do, this CD is well worth having.

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|That Celine Dion is one of the most generous and sincere artists in music today is pretty well-known.  While she has taken a beating from the media and from detractors for being over-the-top in some of her vocals, a bit too dorky in her performances and in interviews, she has remained (sans the chest-beating) true to herself and to the music and fans that made her famous.<br /><br />This DVD set is not only for those who saw the show and want a copy of it to remember, or for those who didn't get to see it and wanted to, but it really feels first and foremost like a gift to her die-hard fans.  Most others wouldn't care for the extended amount of footage (over 3 hours worth) dedicated to the trivia about the show, its creation, execution and evolution over the past four years.<br /><br />I did see the show twice in 2003, and feel that the DVD does a wonderful job of recreating the experience, but if you didn't get to Vegas and sit in the theater that was specifically built for this show, it's not the same.<br /><br />A couple of other differences for those who saw the show: Nature Boy was omitted as the opening and swapped out for the more appropriate \\"A New Day Has Come\\" .. I always thought it was odd that the title song from the show was not sung back in 2003.  Also removed is the tacky and ill-fitting cover of \\"Fever\\", but added in are \\"Love Can Move Mountains\\" (one of my favorites of hers of all time) and \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" in full Tina Turner Tribute mode.<br /><br />I do regret the omission of two of my personal favorite songs from the shows I saw in 2003 - Je'taime Encore (I Love You Still), one of her most haunting French-language songs she's ever recorded, and the show-ending \\"What a Wonderful World\\" that, as she sang it, had black and white photos of people from the audience on the giant LCD screen behind her.  It was a touching and intimate way to end a very theatrical production.  You CAN, however, get both of the audio recordings of these two songs on the live CD of the show that was released a few years back.<br /><br />The fan tribute on here, while often cheesy, is also an endearing look at some of her biggest fans.

It may not grant forgiveness to those who have done these things in our society, but it absolutely will give you perspective.

B000YENUI6|3.0|I remember seeing a preview of this movie and thinking it was going be awesome. Well the first few minutes we see a brutal murder but dont expect to see this thru out this movie. The problem with the movie is the actors seem very winded in this film. They do some lines then pause (as if they just ran 10 miles) and then say the next line. The movie was slow at times to say the least. Viggo Mortensen looks cool in this movie but the performance falls flat. Its too bad because it probably would have made the movie better. I still enjoyed it but probably but wont call it a must see or a classic.

They say no one is perfect but this cd is pretty damn close. The songs are well done and I love Layne's voice. The music really fits the music well. I really enjoyed the songs Dirt, Godsmack, Hate to Feel, and Angry Chair. I never really understood why Godsmack was called a rip off of this band but after I heard this cd I can see why. Its too bad Layne is gone but his music will live on forever. A must have for rock fans.    A side note: VH1 ran a show called Best Songs of the 90's. I remember  they said Alice in Chains were still touring. I think (I could be mistaken) but one of the band members said they are the same as before. Really? Id have to check that out. I dont think anyone can match Layne's voice.

B000YABYLA|5.0|This movie has more product placements and commercials than you would see in an evening of watching TV.  Many of these seem forced, out of place, and have a sour note quality.  However, this movie is being touted as the best movie of the year and in my opinion it deserves all of the praise and hype it is getting.  It is so good that it is hard to start describing why it is so good.<br /><br />The screen play and plot are relatively simple and uncomplicated and there are some scenes that could be improved but any weakness in the screenplay is more than offset by some of the scenes and lines that are some of the best I have seen in any movie in a long time.  Near the beginning we see the boys running track and we hear Juno comment that she loves watching their \\"things flop up and down\\" and \\"all she can think of are all of those \\"pork swords\\".  We see the boys running throughout the rest of the movie and it is hard to erase this from your mind.  Then we have the fight over the senior prom.  Michael Cera's performance here as the wounded dad and exboyfriend is superb, of course Ellen Page does an outstanding job throughout the entire movie.  Another great scene is with J K Simmons (her dad) when she asks him if true and enduring love is possible.  Speaking from the perspective of a 40 year marriage his response was spot on -- a short but well done scene.<br /><br />Then we have the couple who are slated to adopt the child.  Jason Bateman as the prospective dad does an incredible job of showing his immaturity and self-centeredness.  His reaction when Juno calls him old and rejects him is truly excellent since so much of it is in his expression and body language.  Every single actor in this film did an outstanding job and Ellen Page and Michael Cera were the best I have seen in any movie this year.<br /><br />The camera work was excellent as was the direction.  The scene with the freight train was very symbolic and beautifully done just as the scene where Bateman bolts down the stairs to see Juno.  No words were needed -- great direction.<br /><br />I loved this movie but much of it hit too close to my youth and it left me sort of depressed even though it has a semi-happy ending.  I don't think this is a movie suitable for young children but I think it is wonderful for teens.  This is a great movie and should be a candidate for best movie.

It's an emotional family film about the importance of relationships, and it's laugh-out-loud funny!<br /><br />When I went to see Click in a movie theater, the audience was roaring with laughter and obviously touched by the sentimentality. Apparently, these appreciative ticket-buyers hadn't bought the bill of goods by the pompous \\"professional\\" reviewers.<br /><br />If you like good family films appreciated by people of every age, Click belongs in your DVD collection.
B000WMEAKC|2.0|I was really looking forward to OneRepublic's CD, given Ryan Tedder's pedigree and the complete, compelling beauty of \\"Apologize.\\" I was disappointed, though. Tedder's voice is OK, but he doesn't do much with it and I didn't find the music or lyrics particularly interesting. With the exception of a few tracks (two versions of \\"Apologize,\\" \\"Tyrant,\\" and \\"Dreaming Out Loud,\\" which is a bonus track), the CD is a collection of interchangeable, snoozy \\"rock\\" songs that don't hold my attention.
B0002234LS|5.0|I won't spoil this film for you by giving details of the script. Too much has already been revealed! What you need to know is that this is one of the best films I've seen in quite some time. The DVD is riveting, not because of King's story (which is wonderful), but because of Depp's ability to bring it to life.
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|In the hills of Leon, Spain, my friends from Peru told me about Shakira before she had reached Europe. The first [[ASIN:B000069LD9 Shakira: MTV Unplugged [Region 2]]] was already quite special and gave me a few valued hours.<br /><br />Yet this concert tops it. Significantly. It's superb. The registration is superior. Blu-ray high-definition allows for tremendous picture quality. And if you watch it on a Philips Aurea tv (with ambilight effects), the result is an absolutely stunning experience.<br /><br />Music-wise, this is the best tv experience I have had. Ever. If this is a flavor of what future concert blu-rays can become like... I can hardly wait. Meanwhile, if you want to experience the power of high-definition, this is a tremendous disc.
B000GB775E|4.0|Just My Luck is a cute romantic comedy with an almost Freaky Friday kind of twist. Instead of swapping lives, luck is traded, as the title suggests. A down-on-his-luck musician hits the big-time, and a girl with the golden touch loses it all.<br /><br />Will they ultimately get together, learn some lessons about what's really important and fall in love? I'm sure you can guess the outcome, but it's guaranteed you'll have a ball seeing how it all comes about.<br /><br />Just My Luck could be just the right dose of escapist entertainment to brighten up your day.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|It took long enough to get a version of \\"Braveheart\\" with some added features. It has a perfect amount of features without overloading discs with stuff that I'd never watch.<br /><br />The first noticeable thing is the picture quality. Much nicer than the transfer on the first DVD release. And, of course there is the directors commentary, which to me is all that is needed when it comes to special features. I usually watch the \\"Making of\\" and other added stuff just once, but commentary is what I really enjoy.<br /><br />Thanks for this long awaited release. I've noticed that Bonnie & Clyde is getting a Special Edition work-over, which is over due. Next, I'm hoping for \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" done up with some special features and commentary.
6305470464|3.0|There is a lot to like about this movie, for me chiefly the performances of Ryan Phillippe and Jon Stewart. Everyone in the cast is quite good, but these two stand out for me.<br /><br />With Ryan Phillippe there is never a contrived or insincere moment. He's an actor who holds something back ... he allows us to feel there's more to discover about his character, some secret we can find if we look hard enough, something interesting. He and Angelina Jolie slip into a relationship that is poignant and romantic. I wonder what might have happened next.<br /><br />Why has Jon Stewart never done another romantic role? ... he's engaging, likable, believable as a man who falls in love with a woman who turns out to be one of three daughters whose romantic entanglements, along with those of their parents, form the basis of the plot. He's without artifice, natural, real. It is our loss that Jon Stewart has chosen not to do more acting.<br /><br />A nice little film, as good or better than so many being produced today.  Released in 1998, it doesn't seem dated either in appearance or subject matter.
B000062XGK|4.0|Scientists say that we know less about the deep oceans than about the surface of the moon. In one of his first movies, John Cameron takes the idea one step further when evidence surfaces (literally) that there might be an advanced civilization \\"way down there.\\" Harris and Mastrontonio are excellent in their roles, and it's great seeing Ed get a leading man role for once instead of his usual situation of playing supporting roles.<br /><br />The movie combines elements of several genres, in some ways it's a combination of the action, western, sci-fi, and gothic genres, but Cameron skillfully weaves all the different elements together in a way that somehow makes it work. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, it's longer than average, and I agree with several writers that it tends to drag in a few spots, but that's more than made up for by the movies other strengths, which are numerous. And finally, the movie's special effects are as visually exciting as one could ask for, and the deep sea creatures are very cool. :-) It's still a fine movie and one that seems to have held up with the fans on repeated viewings.<br /><br />By the way, I have not ordered any of the DVDs of the film, and am reviewing it here from seeing it in the theater many years ago. But from reading many of the other reviews here about the film, apparently a lot of people are complaining about getting defective DVDs of the movie. So \\"caveat emptor\\"--buyer beware.
B000YA82F6|2.0|Once you get past all the witty, girls-can-talk-trash dialogue and sentimental posturing, Juno is a creepy film that dismisses the act of giving a  baby away for adoption as just another lifestyle choice that carries no serious consequences nor demands any gut-wrenching questions. Here are two comfortably situated teens, living fairly normal lives despite their melodramatic angst. They have caring parents and good homes. When Juno gets pregnant the issue of abortion is addressed but dismissed quickly with an ugly stereotype of a seedy, run-down women's clinic. Yet no where in the film does anyone debate the morality of giving away an unwanted baby. Despite two sets of reasonable, responsible grandparents on hand to raise and support the child, the baby is handed off to an overwrought mother wannabe whose marriage just broke up. Then our cutesy teenage parents get on with their lives, smiling and kissing and appearing to be all set for a loving, committed future, albeit without the flesh and blood they, and their parents, just tossed away for no apparent reason other than convenience. Why this film is portrayed as sweet and uplifting is beyond me. The values portrayed are hardly admirable.
B001152TL6|5.0|I remember seeing Eraserhead many years ago at an \\"art\\" theater in the town where I lived. To that time, I had never seen filmmaking that was so bizarre, dark and twisted - yet strangely compelling. I have been a David Lynch fan ever since and have enjoyed (if that is even the right term) all of his subsequent films.    I first saw Lost Highway many years ago as a rental VHS. A friend and I sat in silence through the entirety of the film and after the credits rolled, we both turned to each other and said \\"what the hell did we just see?\\" After much discussion, we decided that we didn't really understand the \\"plot\\", but somehow the movie had mesmerized us anyway.    That is the magic of David Lynch - the ability to open up little glimpses into the dark corners of our subconscious and draw us in with a look or a phrase or an image from the character on the screen. His movies will bounce you around like a pinball and in the end leave you wondering and guessing, but isn't that a refreshing change from most of the \\"crap\\" that passes as filmmaking these days?    I watched Lost Highway again (for the second time) today and confess I am no wiser about anything other than maybe some subtle details. I did, however, enjoy the movie every bit as much as the first viewing - and maybe more.     If you are a fan of romantic comedies, this probably isn't the film for you. However, if you are more adventurous in your selections then I think you will love this film as much as I do.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This product was even better than expected! It arrived in a timely fashion & in excellent condition! Our son loves it!
0743298039|5.0|I was hesitant to even read this book after reading the back cover several times, but once I sat down with it, I just couldn't put it down.  Setterfield's storytelling is wonderful and reminds me of a more modern Bronte sisters style.  An excellent read.
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief is the story of Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old illiterate girl who loses her family during World War II. Liesel's story is one of struggle, friendship, love, and courage. However, it's her biographer that makes the story unique. The Book Thief is narrated by Death himself.<br /><br />Death is an uneasy narrator. He's a skittish personality who fears humans, perhaps as much as humans fear him. Death is an unlikely sympathetic character because he doesn't relish his work. He laughs at the human notion that he wears a cloak and carries a scythe. Instead, Death is an overworked laborer driven by a cruel boss--War. Throughout the story, Death interjects sparse nuggets of helpful information for the reader. He seems to be uneasy with his reading audience as much as he is with his characters.<br /><br />In spite of his reluctance to get involved with humans, Death finds himself drawn into Liesel's story. The Nazi's imprisoned her father for being a communist and her mother gave her to foster parents before the Nazi's came for her as well. Liesel thus finds herself in the care of a rough but not unkind family, the Hubermans.<br /><br />It's at the Hubermans that Liesel learns to read and discover the power of words. Hans Huberman becomes a grandfather figure to her and gives her 2 AM reading lessons when Liesel awakes from her nightly nightmares. Rosa is a gruff, cursing matron who eventually reveals a softer side. Liesel also meets some wonderful characters from around the neighborhood. There's Rudy, a young sprinter and fellow thief, who idolizes Jesse Owens. Rudy's obsession with the African-American sprinter doesn't win him favor with the Nazi Youth Party, but he is undeterred.  There's also Max, a young Jew whom the Hubermans hide in their basement. Liesel makes fast friends with each of these youthful men and learns lessons about loyalty, friendship, and love.<br /><br />In The Book Thief, Markus Zusak captures Liesel's childlike perspective showing that she is somehow able to hold onto while living on Himmel (Heaven) Street - until Allied bombers bring the weight of the war and death to her neighborhood. Zusak is generous with humor and tales of the heroes' thieving mischief. These elements keep the atrocities of Nazi Germany from overwhelming the reader.<br /><br />The Book Thief ultimately is the story about the power of words. Words provide Liesel escape from her nightmares. Her relationship with Max centers on storytelling. Liesel also comes to the terrible realization that Hitler's Third Reich wasn't built with tanks, but first with words. Teen readers will leave this book with an acute understanding of the power of ideas.<br /><br />It's hard to find flaws with the Book Thief. The book is dark and tragic. A story involving Nazi oppression narrated by Death seems like a hard sell to the average teen. However, Zusak writes about Liesel's exploits with a gentleness that softens the weight of the book. Parents might want to be aware that there a few curse words sprinkled in over the course of 550 pages. This reviewer doesn't see them as a reason to keep a mature teen from being exposed to the powerful message of the book.<br /><br />The Book Thief is a worthwhile read. Consider giving this novel to your Senior High School student, and even discussing it together. There are conversations to be had about prejudice, courage, love, and the power of wordsold onto while living on Himmel (Heaven) Street - until Allied bombers bring the weight of the war and death to her neighborhood.

B000I9U9A4|5.0|I have probably watched this movie 15 times.  It's the movie I reach for again and again when \\"there's nothing on.\\"  It was a joy first seeing it on the big screen, the grandeur of the sea battles was amazing in the theatre.  I never tire of the characters, the relationships, the action, the setting, or the soundtrack.
B000KGGB2A|5.0|It's hard to believe it's been 10 years since Take That's last cd.  But you wouldnt know its been that long after a listen or two to Beautiful World.  Its like the guys never left and are much stronger on this release than any other.  With all the band members not only writing on various songs but also singing lead vocals on them as well.  It brings out a new part of Take That we've been all dying for.  Whether fan or not its hard to ignore a cd that plays great from song 1 to the last song.<br /><br />But this one does just that.  With tracks such as:<br /><br />What You Believe<br />I'd Wait For Life<br />Shine<br />Hold On<br />Beautiful World<br />Reach Out (excellent opening)<br />Patience (one of fav by them)<br />Ain't No Sense In Love<br />Wooden Boat<br /><br />i know i almost listed the whole cd, but its really that impressive and deserves all the attention that it gets now and in the future.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to their next release as well which i just found out about earlier..i'll be buying more of Take That's music for years to come..excellent song writing, vocals and production.  Other music artists could learn a thing or two from them.

B000UX6THK|5.0|This is my all-time favorite TV show. No other show even compares. BUT...it is completely missing the absolutely CRUCIAL first scene from season 2!! This is unforgiveable. Thank God I have the season 2 stand alone collection or I'd be even more angered than I am now. Whatever the case, the fact that one of THE most crucial scenes from the entire series is missing, makes this edition anything but definitive!<br /><br />** Edit ** I contacted the manufacturers and they QUICKLY sent me replacement discs. Thanks so much!
B000ADWDF2|5.0|Wow! This is some movie. I'm no expert on films but I know when I see something that is flat out great and this movie is it. The story is topical(a soldier who is a loving husband,father serving in Danish Army in Afganistan)and very powerful in showing his return and how it affects his Wife, Kids, and rest of his Family. What makes this film so good is how authentic the characters are portrayed. Unlike similar American films (Home of the Brave)nobody seems like they're \\"acting\\" here,right down to the two adoreable little girls. The two brothers involved with Connie Nielsen are equally compelling and the movie leaves you breathless with how \\"real & unsanitized\\" all the characters are. Track down this film and watch it--it's great.
B000SINT52|3.0|Jeeze ... this film has become such a lightening-rod, I'd like to be as careful as I can in my review to leave my own political opinions out of it.     There were certain things I wanted to see when I sat down to watch the film. I've always felt that in a documentary, structure and integrity are absolutely critical to the success of the piece. That may sound fairly obvious, but Moore's 'Bowling for Columbine' took a LOT of liberties with a TON of the facts it was using to build it's argument as well as jumping all over the place, subject wise (Tim McVey/NRA/gun control/urban violence/Lockheed Martin/the media/K-Mart ... dammit Mike ... pick one and stick with it). I wanted to see it demonstrated that Moore was past that and trusted his facts enough to present his argument.     So how did he do? Well ... it's better then 'Columbine.' I still think Moore hit his high-water mark with 'Roger and Me,' but it IS better then the irresponsible 'Columbine.' For the most part, it passed the smell test. On Moore's web-site he made sure to present the sources he used for his information so the audience could see where he was drawing his conclusions from.     Granted, several facts have since been de-bunked by the 9-11 commission, but GENERALLY speaking he's much more accurate here then 'Columbine' was in its best moment. The habit that Moore seems to have developed that drives me crazy though, is that he's too prone to (not always, but sometimes) build a particular argument on HIS INTERPRETATION OF facts, instead of the facts themselves. This occasionally leads Moore to start getting really carried away with a few of his conspiracy theories (... a pipeline though the middle-east?).     The thing that Moore really has a genuine knack for, is capturing the ridiculous side of human nature and being able to make people laugh at themselves during the worst of times. I'm thinking of the segments with the \\"office parachute\\" or the sealed \\"anti-terrorist pot-a-john.\\" There's not enoughthough, I would have loved it if we had seen more of Moore's particular brand of \\"gallows humor.\\"     I'm still of the opinion that Moore still jumps subjects too quickly. I'd love for him to just sit down and make a film on JUST the 2000 presidential election or JUST FOX New's right-wing bias or JUST the way fear is used by the media in today's society. As it is, in Fahrenheit, Moore tries to cover every subject and as a result, some incredibly interesting work winds up feeling half-finished.     While watching this, realize that it needs to be taken as an Op/Ed piece.  If you do that, the whole film instantly becomes much better. For Bush supporters, you have to realize that this piece is NOT the least bit \\"fair or balanced\\" as Fox News would say. For the Left, you also need to remember that Moore very clearly HAS an agenda and he's been proven in the past to be a little loose with the truth to make his point. Just because it's such an open-handed slap at Bush, doesn't automatically mean that it's good. Don't be afraid to challenge Moore and to research his facts on you own. What you may learn will only strengthen your own convictions regardless of which side of the political coin you're on.     There-in lies the value in a piece such as this. As always, Moore's \\"every-man\\" image will incite people who may not normally follow the political process to get involved and educate themselves. The challenge for either side is to not just take it at face-value.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Great movie Fast, Action Packed brings all the pieces together this movie rocks Bourne at his best as he returns to where it all began and revenge is the name of the game. I really enjoyed the first two an was hoping there would be a third and I couldn't wait to get it. Matt Damon is great as Jason Bourne. Outstanding one of the best films of 2007 if you like action you will like this one this movie does not slow down it keeps moving from one country to another until the final countdown where he comes home. The fights are really good and they are fast everything  keeps you on the edge of your seat, I loved the different countries they choose for this and the fact that it starts where the other on left off  you have got to see this one if you saw the other two get this one it's the best.
B0002XVQNU|2.0|Before I go into any kind of criticism I wanted to make sure I pointed out the good in Daredevil, because there's really a lot there to enjoy.  I LOVED ... I mean ... LOVED the origin story in the beginning. It was PERFECT absolutely perfect. I can't say it enough, although a character or two was missing, they perfectly captured the spirit of what made Daredevil such an appealing character.    The casting was pretty good.  I know I'm going against the grain on this one, but, in my opinion, I thought Ben Affleck was a terrific Matt Murdock/Daredevil. I felt that although Jennifer Garner looked amazing as Electra, her performance came across a little rigid, as if she couldn't relax into the role. Colin Ferrell was hysterical as Bullseye. Ferrell was clearly having the time of his life making the movie. Michael Clarke Duncan was OK as Kingpin, he certainly brought the correct physical presence to role role, if nothing else ...    The stunts and 'shadow-vision' and effects, I enjoyed them all. I also LOVED all of the little nods to the comic book readers such as Frank Miller and Kevin Smith's cameo, seeing long-time artist John Romita's name as Jack Murdock's opponent.    I loved the coy interaction between Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson or Matt Murdock and Electra. I ate it all up, I just couldn't get enough.    But of all the things they could have possibly slipped on, how did they actually slip on the character of Daredevil? They turned him into Batman for God's sake! Daredevil isn't a dark brooding anti-hero and he certainly isn't a murderer. He's the guy you see leaping off of a twenty-story building without a net with a big grin on his face. He's Spiderman without the Spider.    I was actually heartbroken that they had built up this insane amount of positive momentum and then lost it all when they turned Daredevil into a cold-blooded killer. I know they incorporated it into the storyline of Daredevil \\"finding himself\\" but it was just so far out of his character itbordered on being unforgivable for me. Try as I might I really had a hard time getting past it; especially in light of how much they got right.    Not a bad movie by any stretch, I'd still look forward to seeing a sequel, but it definitely has flaws.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|What in the HELL is up with the last 8 tracks? All they are is repeats of the original 10 tracks! Check for yourself, and I can guarantee that you can match up EVERY SINGLE ONE of those last 8 tracks with one of the first 10. EXACTLY.    ...all that aside, I heart Radiohead. =) I just wish the extra 8 tracks not released with the download album had been B-sides or extra, unreleased tracks.    This is DEFINITELY one of the best albums they have come out with - the way they have matured in their sound over the last 14 years has been incredible, and has only gotten better with age - which is an extremely rare thing in this industry.
0385512058|3.0|I've read the reviews of \\"Never Eat Alone\\" and there really isn't a common ground. Some people swear by it, others see it as a self-serving ripoff, others call it \\"nothing special.\\" Who's right? Answer: You all are.    Networking is one funny animal. You network because you want something. Some people are afraid or ashamed to come right out and say that, but let's just cut to the chase. No matter how gracefully you may network, no matter how richly developed your spirit of \\"giving first\\" may be, you want something. That's why you'd even consider buying this book. That's why you're reading this review.    Any sales/marketing/networking \\"guru\\" worth giving the time of day to is aggressively self-centered and self-promoting. I don't care if it's Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy, Jeffrey Gitomer, Frank Rumbauskas, Harvey Mackay, Joe Vitale...each and every one of these authors wants to sell you more of their product. Their books, their videos, their CDs and cassettes...what do you think they DO for a living? They try to get you off of the sofa so that you'll do the things you should already know to do without reading their books.    YES, Ferrazzi runs the constant risk, throughout this book, of injuring himself by patting himself on the back a little too hard. Would you prefer it if he acted ashamed and apologetic?    John T. Molloy wrote a book called [[ASIN:0446385522 John T. Molloy's New Dress for Success]]. He discusses a study in which two different groups of men were sent into a social, \\"cocktail party\\" situation. The first group was instructed to behave in a \\"confident\\" manner. The second group was instructed to behave in an \\"arrogant\\" manner. When the participants were later asked which group of men they liked the best, the \\"arrogant\\" group won.    Molloy's point? You must ride the line between \\"confident\\" and \\"arrogant\\" to achieve the best results.     Ferrazi may very well be the \\"Networking Jerk\\" he discusses on page 56. While he cautions you to \\"Never Give In To Hubris\\" on page 268, maybe he's busting at the seams with hubris.    Subjecting yourself to as many viewpoints as possible...from winners and losers, heroes and jerks...this will allow you to gain an appreciation for who YOU are, what success means to YOU, and what YOU are willing to DO for it.    Even if you walk away from this book thinking that Ferrazzi is a self-serving weasel, guess what?    The next time you're out in the business world you'll be able to spot a self-serving weasel before they take advantage of you. Can you honestly say that you see NO value in that?    And what if you find one piece of information...just one...that moves you down the chess board to greater victory, greater success. Isn't it worth a look to find out?    The chances are GOOD...no, EXCELLENT...that you will never MEET Keith Ferrszzi IN PERSON, and even if you DO, WHY won't you LEARN whatever you CAN from this man? He MIGHT NOT BE a decent human being in \\"real life\\"...then again, he MIGHT BE...but this isn't about Keith babysitting your damned KIDS, it's about his ability to shed some light on YOUR SUCCESS.    An open mind is critical to any kind of significant and lasting success. If you're torn between the Amazon reviews, go to a local bookstore and read a few chapters off the shelf. Then make up YOUR OWN mind.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This soundtrack is, in my opinion, one of the best movie soundtracks I've heard in a long time.  Perhaps this is because I've always loved The Beatles.  Some highlights of this soundtrack, minus the missing two songs (which I don't find too upsetting that they're not included), are \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" sung by T.V. Carpio whose voice is absolutely heart breaking and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" sung by Martin Luther McCoy which is definitely a sweet surprise.  Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson leave you stunned as they belt out their solos, and even Dana Fuchs has some surprise duets which are pretty good.      However, like all soundtracks there are some weak songs that I wouldn't listen to everyday, but none-the-less do have some merit.  After all, the producers haven't removed all of The Beatles' genius in some of the re-formatted songs with crazy guitar riffs that scrape the ears but still seem surprisingly pleasant.  But there is something in this two-disc set for everyone.  There's gospel, jazz, a Capella, folk, alternative, some hardcore relatives, and of course rock and roll.  There is not a weak singer in the bunch, and if you haven't seen the movie perhaps this is best because it makes you appreciate the music even more (for example, the crazy football scene in the background may take away some of the beauty of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" for some).  But still make sure you see the film.  It's definitely not to be missed, nor is this soundtrack.
B000UR366S|2.0|I loved Joni Mitchel but this recording gave me the impression of a very depressed woman... I am sorry , this is the only time I have reviewed something in AMazon. I think she is lonely, and depressed.  At her age it seems like she would have more profound messages than what bears do in her back yard.  Maybe I missed it, maybe it went way over my head...granted.  It seems to me that nature has many beautiful lessons, more uplifting, maybe she has had those moments of pure clarity, maybe as James Redfield has stated she has had those moments when she has felt the energy that nature provides, but she has not been able to communicate it, rather one finishes with a feeling of having to resurrect from the ashes of this CD.  Very sad... the only redeeming value is the last poem that she wrote the music to.  Sorry, I wish I coud be more positive about it Joni, and I wish for you that you truly feel the beauty and marvels that surround you in the apprently almost mythical paradise in which you live.
B000RG1FMO|4.0|YES, Ye pops out another good album.  Now, this isn't as good as his second to me, but I had fun listening to it (and a few laughs).  I love his over arrogant attitude and how it reflects in his songs.  Plenty of laughs there.  And the beats were tyte.  He ain't the best rapper out there, but I went into this knowing that and I have to say, he's pretty impressive on the mic.  Still, I dug this album a lot and would recommend this to any Ye fan:)
B000001E18|5.0|I hated this album after it first came out.  Little did I know that it would be U2's last great album and now I think it is a haunting, dark creation.
0143038419|3.0|Yes, it was very funny - Gilbert is very charming and clearly able to \\"make friends with a lamppost\\" as she says.  It's worth reading, I finished it in a day or two.  Nothing really to hold onto after that, except a few one-liners.  I found it a bit ridiculous to have these epiphanies every other page or so, it seems, for much of the first half of the book (for example, at the fountain in Italy, or getting her divorce papers signed by divine intervention).  That seemed trite.      I understood it when I remembered she'd gotten a book deal before she left, and was no doubt compelled to have a happy ending no matter what.    I was also disturbed by the fact she revealed the healing woman's methods of getting women pregnant (by having a cab driver come in and have sex with her).  This would seem a terrible breach of confidentiality that might have damaging repercussions for her subject, who she is otherwise very compassionate towards (she takes up a collection to buy her a house, etc.)  Was anyone else bothered by this?
0375758992|4.0|This book is fascinating, though not the best pick for those with a weak stomach. It's painfully honest and that's why I loved it. The author has a really rich yet simple way of writing, so you feel, smell, see, taste the entire experience they had growing up in Africa. It's far from a comfortable way of life, and it's downright depressing in some parts, but that's reality. I really respect someone who is able to write about their own life without glamorizing it nor condemning it.
0385339704|4.0|In this early novel by Grisham, he dives into the intrigue and secrets of Washington insiders, the murder of 2 supreme court justices, and the conspiracy behind it. A law student at Tulane University writes a brief nicknamed the Pelican Brief in which she proposes one of the president's financial supporter's link to the murders. This happens to fall into the hands of the FBI then makes its way to the President and CIA. They launch an all out investigation but apparently whomever ordered the original murders doesn't like this and begins knocking off more people. The law student connects with a reporter from the Washington Post and they go on a wild chase to prove the veracity of the brief while running from the killers.<br /><br />Written in his classic legal thriller style, The Pelican Brief is quality Grisham fiction and will keep you turning the pages to the end.
0312962118|4.0|This is my first spy novel, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. I don't lose tracks of the characters, and the story flowed smoothly.<br /><br />There were previous reviews about Meade's mistakes regarding certain languages and topography. This I was not aware, but if this the case. Shame on him. I had two serious issues with the book. First, I had a problems visually with half of the action scenes. Second, why did Anna do through these bouts of weakness when she believed in once instance in the story, that Alex was being too brutal. I don't understand drastic times call for drastic measures.
0143038419|5.0|This is such a wonderful book, and I suggest it to those who have traveled the world, and those who wish to.  The writer is hilariously funny, cynical and yet so open to new ideas and searching for so many different things, which she finds by hurling herself into situations in which she is ill equipped.  She is so confident and willing to stumble in her life, and I really, deeply admire her, her strength and need to change her life when everything seemed so bland and impossible.  This book will be passed onto other people, and if you're looking for a really fantastically funny, but also very deep, story of someone's awakening, this is the one.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|As a big superman fan, I was very happy to see this DVD make it to the light of day. While I thought the Richard Lester theatrical release was good at the time, that too was not as good as superman I. When I read that they has shot both one and two simultaneously, I wondered why they looks so different. Now I know. While this version is not 100% of Dick Donner's vision it is 90%, and that is better then 0%.<br />Although this so called final or original cut is up dated they didn't go over board with the CGI. They blended it very well with the look of the late 70's.<br />You can see some of the minor flaws in a few seines. This is due to lost negatives and having to resort to using screen test and out takes to fill in some of the gaps. Once again Dick Donner and the studio did a very good job. They added back the cut seines with Marlon Brando. How can you cut that out?! Well they did it to save money. I think this would have been a much better version in the theaters back in 1980, even better if Donner was allowed to fully complete 100% of his work. The suites are ruining Hollywood.<br />The story is changed somewhat, but not so you wont recognize it. General Zod is still the villain.<br />The commentary track is a great bonus from the director and writer Tom Mankiewicz.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Just as good as OK Computer. I loved every song, except for videotape. The drumming and guitars on this album are really stellar. I waited to preorder this album on amazon because the download available at the radiohead website is of lower quality than what you would get from itunes or from the CD. I'm old fashioned, I like to have the physical CD, digital music seems so disposable.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|The second 'Underworld' film goes beyond the first when it comes to action sequences and special effects - they are often breathtaking. The prologue is excellent and the gothic atmosphere is kept throughout the movie. The movie really expands what the first one created, and fortunately, it seems like there's more to come.
B000YAA6AU|1.0|Ok, so this is going to sound pitiful but this is all it's worth....this is the worst piece of #$%& movie you'll see.  DON\\"T WASTE YOUR TICKET!!!!  It's drawn out, slow, boring, unmoving.  The only somewhat redeemable parts are by Jeffrey Dean Morgan.  But even he can't make you not want to leave early.  Save yourself!!!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|What's NOT to like about it? For me, this DC is far better than the original movie. Some scenes cut from the original are quite simple, but still, very emotional and should have never left the movie in the first place. They provide more depth to the movie and its characters. The soundtrack is just the way the director had originally intended, and they also had more time to work with the special effects.<br />And well, yes, the original movie is far more \\"open\\" to interpretation, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. As for me, I liked to know what the director's idea for what was behind the events that happened in the movie was.<br />One thing is clear for me: The Director's Cut of Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies EVER.
B00122HPDU|5.0|I have found little that I don't like of his.  I am a big fan of Frank Sinatra and he does the songs so well.  If you like jazz music, buy his albums!!
0967175429|5.0|OK, there are misspellings and grammatical mistakes, big deal, the information is really neat, and more importantly, it WORKS.  This book is packed with useful information.  I read it 5 times through, getting useful stuff each time.  I have been able to master her methods from the book, though I do also plan to take a seminar.  I got more results faster with this book than any other.  She doesn't just talk about feelings, she notes that you can download feelings you lack.  This book, along with Richard Bartlett's [[ASIN:1582702381 Matrix Energetics: The Science and Art of Transformation]], was highly recommended in a LOA course I took.  I went back and forth between them, which helped me understand each of them better.  No rehashes here, this lady got her stuff pure.  I got a copy for my daughter, for someone at work, and for my wife.  I sent copies of her previous books to other friends.  I have one thing to say on this book: YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Now Vianna may perhaps have gotten somewhat too full of herself, in the last few years.  She has detractors on the web.  The book itself is good.  I would probably not take any courses with Vianna, based on what her students have told me, but then again I don't need to, I have this book.  Now you do have to enter into the Theta state, the zero point state, the state of pure consciousness, for any of this to work.[[ASIN:0615226809 The Secret of Instant Healing]], [[ASIN:1582702497 The Physics of Miracles: Tapping in to the Field of Consciousness Potential]], [[ASIN:146995365X Dowsing and Manifesting]], [[ASIN:3839143632 Healing with Quantum Energy]] and [[ASIN:2980744123 DNA Demystified, Volume 1: A Practical Guide to Reprogramming the 13 Helixes at Zero Point]] approach this subject from similar places.  I tried the techniques myself, and they worked for me.  The detractors seem to want to force every theory into their own little boxes.  This doesn't work.  You have toenter into the world of the author of any book, to understand it.  When I was studying calculus, which I found difficult, I had to enter it from the textbook author's viewpoint, to do anything.  I couldn't force that text into my own restricted ideas.  Same with this.  The people giving it high marks do so from inside the book; the detractors clearly never entered into what the book is talking about.  Oh well.  One energy/feeling I downloaded was for my life to be better than the best I could imagine, a la Neville Goddard.  At work, they did a workload equalization, which I hadn't seen or heard of in 20 years.  Things aren't perfect, but they are- yes- better than the best I could have imagined, when I started.  When my newborn daughter was in the hospital, she was getting vaccines, which would give her high fevers, really high, enough that the nurses got really nervous.  I alternated between Matrix Energetics and this book, as this was all I had to read for 3 weeks in the hospital as I stayed with my daughter- my wife was sick- and each time, the fevers went down.  Of course this was no kind of medical treatment, only an altering of patterns, however I was very convinced the book was useful.  Other problems just kind of melted away.  This book, and the other books I've cited, are the first steps into the world of human scale Quantum Mechanics, out of the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm that physics left over 100 years ago, but which society is only now starting to leave.  Books on shamanic work make a lot more sense in the light of Theta Healing.  Heck, there are scientists who think we are only a bunch of chemicals.  That's fine- but that is only their viewpoint.  I want as many viewpoints as I can get- as with Neils Bohr's multi-model concept- so I can get some idea of what is real.  This book helped and helps me.
B000E6UWE4|1.0|I was encouraged to buy this book by several positive reviews.  I was greatly disappointed.  First, the writing, when not grammatically incorrect, is very confusing.  There are many times I have had to read a passage 3 and 4 times over before I figured out what the author meant to say.  I found reading the book very tiresome because of it.      However, my bigger complaint is the method of storytelling.  Erikson writes as if we are privy to the background of all the characters and their world.  Very little is actually explained.  To do this a few times can build suspense and curiosity, but it is used so much in this book that I get the feeling that the author was simply too lazy to explain what was going on.  I have read Jordan, Martin, Goodkind, and Rothfuss and have enjoyed parts or all of each of them.  Unfortunately, I have little to reccomend about Erikson.
0810993139|5.0|Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid is really more of an illustrated story than a graphic novel.  The book tells the tale of a school year in the life of an awkward, but not atypical, middle-school boy through his journal entries, with every page featuring one or two illustrations to compliment the scene or situation.  I read the book in about an hour and frequently found myself chuckling or even laughing aloud.<br /><br />However, I must say that despite the format and language of the book, or indeed the suggested reading age advertised for it, this is really a tale that adults, mainly males in their twenties, will probably get the most out of in regards to the humor.  Middle-school aged students are likely to be too close to their present situation to see the jokes for what they are.  Rather, it is best viewed through a sense of nostalgia for those young adult men that can sympathize with the plights of the main character, especially if they weren't popular with girls or proficient at athletics, as this reviewer certainly was not.  The main character often does some rather inconsiderate things, resulting on occasion in traumatized children hiding under a bed (or a Hallway of Screams) or broken bones (by throwing a football under a speeding Big Wheel), but young people his age tend to do these foolish things.  The character is stuck in that place beyond childhood and before sexual and ethical maturity, indeed before even `teenage rebellion' age.  This is not a book to teach the featured age-group how to act, but rather acts as a humorous reminder of how it was for those who gladly left that period of their lives at least a decade ago.  It's a fun and short work to entertain oneself while in a waiting room, or to share with friends.
0596527055|5.0|Mr. Scott Berkun's The Myths of Innovation is a must read for anyone interested in innovation.  Many common historical perceptions are dispelled throughout the book and while it doesn't give a formula as to how a person can innovate, that's exactly one of the points of the book; there isn't a formula for innovation.    Anyone in business, science, government or education, just to name a few, who is interested in creating an environment that is conducive to change and innovation would be well severed by buying this book, reading it and taking notes to help pull out pertinent messages at later times.     In the preface Mr. Berkun points out that while there is some building that goes on chapter to chapter, each chapter is written to stand alone.  I believe this will come in very handy as you continue to think about particular aspects of innovation and want to pull the book off the shelf to reread a particular segment of the book.    Below is just a sampling of the interesting ideas I gathered...         - Big thoughts are fun to romanticize, but it's many small insights coming together that bring big ideas into the world. (pg. 8)  - The greater the potential of an idea, the harder it is to find anyone willing to try it. (pg. 56)  - If we struggle to imagine past innovators doing amazing things in our workplaces, what makes us think we can do creative work in them?  Talent is only as good as the environment it's in. (pg. 96)    Best of luck to any of you trying to either create innovation or to create an environment that is conducive to innovation.  It can definitely be an uphill battle but I believe this book can help in your journey.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I've been waiting for a DVD release of the original version of Blade Runner ever since I went DVD, this being one of my all time favorite movies. This set is just monster with all the versions together and a truly wonderful remastering job done on both the picture quality and the sound. Then they give you all this at the price of a regular Blu-ray disc. I pre-ordered this as soon as I saw it was coming out and had to wait four months for it to reach me but the wait was worth it. Ridley Scott has done a wonderful job with the remastering and given us Blade Runner fans the full deal, the color, the mood, the style and the feeling of being part of this future is all there and some. The picture quality is so crisp you'll feel like you were poked it the eyes. Four different versions of this remarkable film, completely explained and all the extra features you could want other than an interview with Vangelis about the stunning soundtrack. You will not be disappointed. This is the brightest gem in my blu-ray collection.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|I enjoyed this entry into the Resident Evil series a lot,in fact even more so than the first two.The DVD features an excellent picture and sound transfer of very high quality. Recommended, worth watching for sure.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I had not seen this prior to buying the Blu-ray version, I was basically looking for something to show off my 1080 Flat Panel via my blu-ray player and this looked like the perfect thing. Planet Earth was stuck in my player for weeks, I spent many many hours being charmed, amazed, stunned and actually found myself holding my breath time and time again. I even had my 7 year old granddaughter watching it and she loved it. Don't think, just buy, you can thank me later. I'll be picking up anything else put out by the BBC on nature from now on.
0765318741|3.0|I thought this was a great story, well laid out with a good pace.  There weren't too many lulls or too much action.  I can't compare to the movie because I haven't seen it.  The only disappointing thing about this book is that the I Am Legend story only takes up the first half, so just when you think things are getting exciting, the story ends!  The rest of the book is filled with short stories by the author that have nothing to do with I Am Legend.
0451529065|5.0|Yes, it's dense but a must for evolution buffs.  A vastly more entertaining read: NATURAL SELECTION by Dave Freedman, all about the evolution of a new species of flying predator!  What makes it fantastic is that while a work of fiction it's brilliant researched and teaches you what evolution really is.  It gets into the evolution of the brain, the lung, flight - really cool stuff - but unlike dry textbooks, does it at warp speed.  I literally could not put this book down, read it cover to cover in 2 days.  A tremendous \\"fictional complement\\" to Darwin's classic.
B000R4SMCW|1.0|If you are a lawyer, please don't watch this movie, it'll drive you nuts a la \\"The Devil's Advocate\\"    1.  Ryan Gosling is playing a phenomenally talented D.A.  Who takes a job at a big law firm (only Hollywood thinks those Biglaw firm jobs are hard to get and desirable to working anywhere else in law; please), and who then on day one sleeps with a Partner.  Okaaaay.  Oh, and apparently those lawyers never work, they just go to fancy parties.  Riiiiight.      2.  He's such a fantastic D.A., but he can't win a murder case without the murder weapon?  Really?? It's an airtight case with or without the weapon and confession. And (without spoiling the ending) he has to look up a law that every lawyer, not to mention every viewer of legal thrillers, is 100% aware of?
B00004RNLE|5.0|Fried Green Tomatoes is truly a beautiful movie.  The senses  are flooded with superior video and sound, the characters are compelling through excellent acting, and the heart is warmed through the wonderful story.  Although many of the unpleasant traits of human beings are in evidence, notably racism, these scenes are done in a manner that is counterbalanced and overshadowed by the positive human characteristics and relationships that dominate the film.    Fried Green Tomatoes seeks, and draws out, the best qualities in people; and viewers can not only discern and identify with the characters, they can identify with the emotions inside them that make them beautiful.  It is a film about loving and giving with touches of sadness and true human comedy in between.    Mary Stuart Masterson \\"makes\\" the film and compliments the superb acting of her fellow cast members.  But none of this could have happened without the superior directing of Jon Avnet who illustrates and paints this story and then saturates our senses with every aspect of this beautiful film.
B000VZBCWE|5.0|I was at one of the nights recorded for this release! It really brings back some great memories. I don't think any of us knew at the time it was being recorded, but looking at it now, you can see the huge film cameras in some of the audience shots; but that was on the floor, we were in the serious nosebleed section! It didn't matter though, the old Montreal forum, sadly no longer with us, was a GREAT place to see shows no matter where you were sitting, as it was primarily a hockey arena. Saw some great shows there, Rush, STYX, etc. back in the day. I do have a copy of the earlier dvd release of this show, and this one is much better, a little cleaned up mistake wise, but that is to be expected these days I guess. But these guys were such great musicians there were not many errors! They played one of my all time favorite Queen songs, \\"Save Me\\" that night! We did know that they were only playing here and that was it, no tour, so that did make it a little more special. The \\"Greatest Hits\\" LP had just come out, and the Under Pressure song was absolutely massive at the time. The big rumor going around the arena was since this was essentially a one-off gig, that David Bowie was going to sing his vocals for the song live in person, but alas this did not turn out to be the case, but I think they had his recorded vocals, if you listen carefully you can hear them. If you are a fan definately get this! Can't believe the price is so cheap, I ordered the CD too! No \\"Flash Gordon\\" on the dvd, I recall they used a little of the film footage in the backdrop, so it could be one of those copyright crap deals, its a shame, but you are not missing that much.

1591841666|4.0|I have always found Godin's books to be insightful in a way that is infuriating.  Infuriating because they talk about very simple and powerful ideas that once you read them you know that you should have known this all alone.  That combination of clear ideas, powerful ideas, and I know this are all here in the Dip.  And that combination makes this book great.<br /><br />The dip is a simple book with an important idea -- that you have to think about quitting and that winners know when to quit, quit often and work through the dips to get to the goals they are looking for.  As a personal career management book this is a gem.  I bought the audio version of the book, my first audio book and it is well suited to that medium.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good business career or corporate management book that is in the same vain I recommend \\"What were they thinking\\". So a strong recommendation to make sure that you are making progress and not climbing your way into a dead end.
B0000CFW87|3.0|guess I'm just over the same old same old sound he has.    don't get me wrong, he is amazingly talented..... with a phenomenal voice,    I just got a touch bored.
B000HT386M|3.0|Not a bad Adam Sandler vehicle, it's got some good scenes and good lines.  Like so many other movies, beginning with the classic It's a Wonderful Life, and continuing on as recently as The Family Man, it's a supernatural-enabled paean to middle-class values and to the ever-sought, but seemingly never achieved without divine intervention, goal of \\"family comes before work.\\"  The plot allows you to always stay a step ahead, and is both never too daring nor too timid.  Overall, it's worth a rental.
B000MV9026|5.0|If your children would like this movie, I would say ALWAYS buy your DVD's on Amazon.     Amazon has the best prices and FREE shipping. That's why I always shop Amazon.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|We have an area of hardwood that leads into linoleum.  It works beautifully sliding under barstools where the kids eat and drop crumbs. It also picks up our hamsters shavings.

My three year old thinks it is a present for her and loves to clean - theres no way she can get it wrong.

B000TLTUL0|5.0|Blood--gushing, pouring, spurting blood--could almost be considered a major character in Tim Burton's film version of Stephen Sondheim's \\"Sweeney Todd.\\" It stampedes toward us as if it had a life of its own, outside the veins of the characters from whom it spurts. \\"Sweeney Todd,\\" with its obvious opportunities for Gothic horror and Grand Guignol, may well be the movie Tim Burton was born to make; it's a film that does total justice to its Broadway source while taking full advantage of the cinematic opportunities that source presents. Take the way Burton films \\"By the Sea,\\" Mr. Lovett's daydream song of domestic bliss with Sweeney; in candy colors that contrast wildly with the Stygian darkness of the rest of the film, Burton demonstrates--hilariously and tragically--the sheer impossibility of that daydream. I was a little concerned before the film's premiere that Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter would never be a vocal match for Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the original Broadway production. Of course, I was right, but fortunately that concern is irrelevant. Bonham Carter is an adequate singer, Depp a little better than adequate, but both are such brilliant actors that they put the songs across on that basis alone. (The best singers in the production are Jamie Campbell Bower, who looks and sounds like a Botticelli angel as lovelorn sailor Anthony Hope, and Ed Sanders, who as Toby Ragg is a smashing cross between Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger.) Burton puts his own unmistakable stamp on the production, underlining the heartlessness of Victorian society in a way Dickens would have applauded; even more, Burton understands that \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is a story that has to sweep up the audience in its bloody embrace, or else it is nothing. The original 1979 production with Cariou and Lansbury, directed by Harold Prince, did just that. Recently in Toronto I saw the road company of the musical's latest version, in which the actors roam around on stage playing instruments; I was impressed by the level of talent on stage, but the play itself left me cold. Bertolt Brecht would have loved the distancing effect; I did not. Burton's \\"Sweeney\\" grabs you by the throat and the heart, which is exactly what the story should do; Burton and Depp, especially in the film's final moments, bring home the story's inherent tragedy with breathtaking power. Praise is deserved all around, from Dariusz Wolski's moody photography, Dante Ferretti's malevolent production design and Colleen Atwood's expressive costume design to the excellent supporting performances of Alan Rickman as diabolical Judge Turpin, Timothy Spall as brutal Beadle Bamford and Sacha Baron Cohen as mountebank Pirelli. This \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is a gory masterpiece, and it is one film of our era that seems certain to stand the test of time.s; I was impressed by the level of talent on stage, but the play itself left me cold.

B000VLE3IS|3.0|How many more times is Jimmy Page going to re-package the same old Zep songs?     I KNOW he had access to a bunch of non-album tracks he could put out on CD. I've got a few bootlegs with songs they did in concert that weren't released on any of their albums!     Now THAT would be something worth spending my money on!
B000R6PKP2|5.0|This release rocks! I've been waiting for this for soooo long and finally it's here.  I was a bit disappointed however to discover that the discs are just packed in an ordinary Blu-Ray box and not the embossed digipack which can be seen in the pictures.
B00008WT5E|5.0|If you dont own this album/cd/cassette tape/8 track tape /chipped into your head you must hate life or your mom or my mom!!!    The biggest negative is we cant go back into a time machine to 1978 and meet up at my apartment when I first discovered this jem.    Jem. what a word    Matters not.    If you are under 25 play this baby and play it loud cause you gotz the stamina.  And if you are over 45 play it even louder cause hearing it loud is the last thing you have to worry about losing at this point in your life.    Talking nuances about this is foolish from my standpoint.    There is NOTHING WRONG WITH LATTER ACDC  I dont get into, Bon is better than Brian stuff.  Music is love and all love is good    Having said that, there is something so raw about this moment in their recording history and yet at the same time the exact convergence of physical and meta-physical powers.    In that vein, the only thing missing then would be the song Overdose from an earlier album.  If you know what I mean by that, thanks  If not, cool.    Please, for the sake of Rock and Roll, and possibly humanity, play it and play it loud.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Trainspotting is far varied from the usual drug movies that preceded it.  Along with Requiem for a Dream, Trainspotting was a shift from the casual use of drugs sans the consequences to a far darker tale.  While Requiem for a Dream was clearly an anti addiction tale, Trainspotting uses heroin as catalyst.  It isn't an anti drug movie per se.  Rather, it's a story of a group of friends who happen to use drugs.    The film lifts its material from the book of the same name.  While it's a very different take, excising a lot of the book's material, the spirit is the same.  Notably, it is accurate juxtaposition of Irvine Welsh's stream of consciousness writing, using Renton as the chief protagonist.  While much of the film deals with Renton's heroin usage, we go along with Renton as he hangs out with Sick Boy, readies Spud for a job interview, shoplifts, goes clubbing, gets a job, etc. When he's not interacting with his mates, he's thinking about them.    The film doesn't take a moral stance on drugs, but does show how it is the thing that brings Renton and his mates together and at the same time ruins their friendship.  But it's a combination of factors.  The film has a subtle repeated phrase where Renton or one of the others mutters about another that \\"he's a mate,\\" sticking by each other in spite of it all.  The film makes one ask, what will be the straw that breaks the camel's back?    Aside from a brilliant screenplay, the film boasts one of the best ensemble casts.  While known for making Ewan MacGregor a recognizeable face, it also features the talented Johnny Lee Miller as the James Bond obsessed Sick Boy as well as the infallable Robert Carlyle as the sadistic Begbie.  The combination of music and very inspired shots, including the now infamous scene where Renton overdoses, makes the film alone worth watching.    The DVD features the international cut, without the annoying dubbing of the first US release and a few seconds of film restored.  It also ports over theCriterion laserdisc extras, including a wonderful commentary featuring Ewan, Danny Boyle, and John Hodge.  In addition, there's some newly included production vignettes and, to me what is still the best feature, a number of deleted scenes - which further portray the destruction of the people in Renton's life, including a legless Swanney and a much colder cynical Sick Boy.  This is a feast for fans.
B000ZFI1GK|2.0|I love The Eagles but I was very dissapointed with this CD. The vocals are great and the music is OK but lacking the awesome guitar licks of Don Felder. I've heard Joe Walsh say once that Don Felder was one of the most under rated guitarist out there. He mentioned how Don came up with Life In The Fastlane as a warm up riff along with Hotel California and others. Joe's guitar sounds a little thin without Don. Stewart Smith can play Eagles songs well but not very creative in the writing field. I have every Eagles CD and DVD's out but out of 20 + 2 songs nothing stands out on this one. Too bad they're such a great band. I also liked the Glen Frey tracks better than the Don Henly tracks. I can only hope they'll do more Cd's maybe less songs and more quality. Kinda looks as they knew the songs were not as good so they put more on the CD to compensate.
B000P2A24W|5.0|As a long time Bon Jovi fan this CD did not disappoint me. There a no songs on the CD that I do not like. My two favorite tracks are \\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\" and \\"(You Want To) Make A Memory\\".
B000ASDFJU|5.0|For all SATC fans out there: BUY THIS NOW! Don't waste any more time with the individual seasons. This includes all of them in an adorable booklet with episode descriptions and beautiful illustrations of each episode. The bonus dvd is fun as well! Has games and trivia questions to play. This is definitely a collector's item. I will never get tired of this show and this giftset makes it easy to watch all my favorite episodes.
B000002U9L|5.0|I used to watch this movie at my grandma's when I was little and listening to the soundtrack takes me back. It is the best music! Even though I enjoyed it as a child I still enjoy it now . It's has the perfect blend of music. I used to like Chilly Down and Magic Dance the most , now I prefer Underground and As The World Falls Down!

B000I2J2XQ|4.0|Good Movie, The transfer is not perfect like I hoped. It is good but you do see video noise in dark scenes and even in bright scenes on a large HDTV. in comparison, Phantom of the opera was mostly night scenes and indoors but had a perfect picture
B000FA57N0|5.0|This is definitely the best movie you've never seen. Joss Whedon is incredible, the cast is incredible, and the sound and special effects are awesome in the HD DVD version. I rarely write reviews, but I like to think that by writing this review and supporting a movie that I thoroughly enjoyed, I am helping to bring about a sequel to Serenity.
B00125JP1C|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever sat through. Geez. I want my money back.
B000VR824S|5.0|What a treat this DVD is. This is far better than the Crossroads 2004 set. The guests are awesome: Jeff Beck, Steve Winwood, Buddy Guy just to name a few. The band assembled to play with Clapton is insane. I hear bits of Duane in those Derrick Trucks slide solos! Then all of the Blind Faith done with Winwood, who shows he's a fine guitarist and not just great with the keys. Great sound in Digital 5.1. This is a must have for any blues fan.
006113399X|2.0|The first 2/3 of this book are a pretty good mystery, but in the last third it turns into a run-of-the-mill thriller with all the cliches of the genre: a venal government official, a corrupt cop, about half-a-dozen murders, a cop racing through a city crashing his car into things and narrowly missing a baby carriage, coincidences galore and improbable plot twists right and left. There's even that hoary old trope of lazy thriller writers: a criminal with a split personality.     The translator apparently couldn't make up his mind whether to translate into British English or American, so he seems to have invented a weird mixture of the two.     Much of the last part of the book is the killer's memoirs. Weirdly, these passages switch randomly from past tense to present tense, sometimes in the same sentence. I don't know if the original Norwegian was written that way or if it is the translator's mistake.
B000TCEU4Q|1.0|This unit is nice but in order to make it run correctly you need to buy another program for about $30. The throttle has to be messed with to get it to just idle. I like Saitek products but when you need to buy other  softwear to make it just Idle correctly then I'll think twice about buying there products again. Plus no in box manual.:{
B0008JIJ2E|1.0|Please note...this review is for the quality of the transfer of the original film to DVD.  It is awful!  It almost seems they used a low resolution camcorder and recorded it from a movie theater screen.  The thousands of black specks in the blue sky at the very beginning of the movie were very obtrusive.  If you have a high resolution television it will only make the inferior quality of this DVD more noticeable.
006441034X|5.0|I'm glad that I finally discovered Diana Wynne-Jones through Amazon. Howl's Moving Castle has all the ingredients of an entertaining and enthralling fantasy. I couldn't put it down. Jones has woven her plot in such a way that you won't know what will happen until it does. What is particularly alluring about the book is her sensitive portrayal of her characters and their relationships. The novel is packed with emotion, humour and drama centered around human frailties. I found myself falling in love and identifying with Sophie, Howl and Calcifer. Even the minor characters have their own interesting peculiarities.    A thoroughly satisfying read that people of all ages will enjoy.
0143038419|5.0|This was one of those books that I just could not stop reading!  Maybe it's because I am close in age to Liz, and 2007 was the year that I found Bikram yoga so I could relate to some of her story.      This book really gives you some things to think about!  Read it, and see for yourself!
1594489505|5.0|This latest novel has all the elements of an autobiography (except that it is about two females). It is a fast moving poignant story that gives the reader an indepth accounting of life in Afghanistan before, during and after the Taliban regime. It is a very descriptive novel, such as was the Kite Runner. The only thing that I can recommend in any future books by the author is to have an Afghan to enlish translation of the many Afghan words that is used in his writngs, perhaps in the back pages of the book. I am sure readers would like to know the meaning of the italic words scattered through out the book.
B000YAA6AU|4.0|The story begins with a fight. Holly (Swank) is running up a seemingly endless  flight of stairs with Gerry (Butler) in hot pursuit.  He's apologizing, but like a typical male, he's really not quite sure what he did wrong--he just wants to make up and not sleep in the bathtub.      Nine years' marriage and they don't have a lot to show--no kids, no careers, and only a five flight walkup.  But, it's obvious that Holly and Gerry love each other very much.     The next scene is Gerry's wake.  It's a bittersweet affair--and I confess to laughing when I heard the ironic \\"Fairytale of New York\\" (Gerry's favorite song) played and sung to by his priest.     A few weeks' later, the letters begin.  While the film only shows Gerry's life and Holly's impressions of his 'ghost', we realize he'd understood his cancer would take him and planned to help Holly get through it past the grave.  His letters encourage her to get out, sing Karaoke, even go to Ireland.  Those missives literally help her find her dreams and go on with her life.     \\"PS I love you\\" is what I expected--and more. The cast, scenery, and especially the music all fit well together to elicit tears--and yes, occasional laughter.    Gerard Butler is fabulous as always.  He's one of the best new actors around and I hope to see him for many years to come. I didn't expect that he could sing--and he does an excellent job on \\"Galway Girls.\\"      In my opinion, Hillary Swank is the best part of the film.  She's not your typical Hollywood ingenue.  She's sometimes awkward, she doesn't always look perfect, and yet her ability to convey emotions from the highs to the lows very impressive.  When she comes home from the funeral alone, picks up her cell phone and just keeps calling her home phone to hear Gerry's voice over and over on the answering machine literally brought me to tears.     Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the big teddy bear Billy Gallagher was also great.  You've seen him before if you watched \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" playing Denny Duquette. I'm very glad to see him getting silver screen roles. If you like him, look for him in 2008 in \\"The Accidental Husband.\\"    Only one warning--take some tissues with you. This film will make you cry--and occasionally laugh so hard you'll have tears in your eyes, too.
0143038583|5.0|As a fervent \\"foodie\\" and a true omnivore I was captivated by Pollan's prosaic insight and detailed discussion of today's food chain.  Interesting presentation on sometimes mundane minutia.  I've taken a definite step back to take stock of my food choices and sources.  Fascinating book recommended for anyone who is interested or consumes food.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This is not your typical action film.<br /><br />People better qualified than I to judge the ship to ship battles have reviewed this film so I will only say that I felt as though I more truly understood life on board a British war ship during the Napoleonic era. Because I love history, this film is one I have seen many times and will no doubt view many times again.<br /><br />The acting is superb, the characters more finely drawn than even in the book series where novels allow for more exposition. The relationships between officers and officers and crew and crew members between themselves makes clear the class distinctions of the time. The strategies that had to be employed in ocean warfare using wooden ships with sails I found fascinating. Having worked in theatre, where the members of the cast are virtually the ONLY people you see regularly every day for months or even years, I can understand the tensions and squabbles that can develop even among close-knit supportive team mates. Without the captain's discipline and order, how much more dangerous could such an environment be, especially during wartime? There are layers upon layers in this film, and all of them handled well.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|This is not so much a horror movie (though there is an ample amount of creepiness) as much as it is an absorbing courtroom thriller.  The cast is first rate.  Laura Linney, Campbell Scott and Tom Wilkinson bring immense talent to the roles of courtroom combatants in trial over the death of a young woman who was allegedly possessed.  The movie leaves little doubt that she was - the question becomes whether the priest's intervention constituted negligence which led to Emily Rose's death.      There are theological undertones in the film, good versus evil and he forces of evil at work in the world today.  It is a rebuff to atheists and agnostics alike; to acknowledge the role of the Devil must admit that as a foil there exists a God.  The movie avoids any preachy tone and it is supposedly based on a true story.    The ending appears to be a less than satisfying \\"half a loaf\\" conclusion, and I will say no more lest I spoil it for those who have not yet seen the movie.      A good film!
B000TGJ8CQ|1.0|We have this magician, Frank Cadillac (love of Frankenstein+Cadillacs=whatever), with foresight into the next 2 minutes.  Enter Julianne Moore working for the government to stop terrorists from blowing up 8 million people with a nuclear weapon & she can see no other way than to have this freak working for her.  Everyone does what Moore wants without question, except of course for Cage.  Cage only cares about his girlfriend and for some strange reason he can see her future better than anything else, like 18 hours or some ridiculous thing.  Moore engages in some radical persuasion tactics to get Cage to comply. She has this special room with these little torture devices to hold his eyelids open.  Are we supposed to hate her?  She explains that she's a good guy, but this movie just can't seem to figure it out either.    Cage is strange looking in this film and the romance isn't convincing at all. An odd cameo by Peter Falk is pasted in.   At the end Cage's character starts morphing into all these different versions of himself to go on wild goose chases & to fight people.  I guess it's over my head because I just don't get how he does that. Hello?  Show me a stupid movie with a stupid premise then actually ask me to think?  The movie cuts off abruptly as though they were too lazy to tell you the rest of the story. This would have been a good time for Paul Harvey to make a cameo.   I hated to see Cage and Moore in this film as I am doggedly hanging onto the belief that each of them is better than this.
0525950079|5.0|I have just finished this book and I am besotted with admiration for this man and author, Mr. Ken Follett. Not an identical twin to Pillars of the Earth, but a fraternal twin.

B000WS4M36|5.0|I purchased this album today and... WOW.  Fans of GY!BE will flip.  The final track loops indefinitely on my record player (this is not a defect), the artwork is beautiful (way better than the CD), and it came with a genuine Canadian penny that's been \\"flattened by passing trains\\". This version of F#A#(infinity) is a beautiful piece of art and an excellent addition to any GY!BE fan's collection.
0553382179|5.0|This is the ONLY housekeeping book you'll need. Ever. If you feel the need to have two, then add Don Anslet's \\"Clutter's Last Stand\\" and you're all set. \\"Sink Reflections\\" transformed our home and I sure wish I had read it YEARS ago. Ya know what? It doesn't really take that much time to keep a tidy house IF you know what you're doing & you stay on task, and that's where this book comes in. I love her philosophy of \\"Blessing\\" a home by cleaning it. That concept totally changed how I view housework and chores. I used to think cleaning was thankless and annoying; now I see that it's a way to show love for my family and appreciation for my home.    Great plan for every area of a home and lots of motivation to get up and get going. This book is all business, but funny as well. It isn't a quick fix -it's a realistic and supportive approach to getting organized and staying that way.     I marked sections of the book for later reference and keep it handy. The book includes short commentaries and examples from folks who use her approach, which are very motivational to read. Best tip EVER: using a timer when cleaning a room. It's surprising how much can be accomplished in only 10 minutes when you stay on task. This book won't disappoint; if you're looking to have a tidy, organized, pleasant home this is THE book to have. You'll love your home!!!
B000UD0ESA|5.0|After having already seen this final cut of Bladerunner at the historic Senator Theatre here in Baltimore, I couldn't think it could top the experience of seeing it on their forty foot screen. I can say without reservation that this DVD really delivers the goods and is a vast improvement over the previous directer's cut in every way. When the opening scene of the hellish L.A. landscape opens to Vangelis's magnificent score re-mastered in rich 5.1 surround I knew they had finally done it right this time and I thank all of those people involved in the making of this DVD. The crisp rich picture and the extras on disc two, which run the length of a regular film, make this a more than worthwhile investment for fans of this incredible film masterpiece.
0307387151|4.0|First of all I must say the only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because the first 30 pages or so seemed really sluggish and somewhat boring to me. But I trudged on thankfully because the story was just incredible and it became this book I could hardly put down. There's somewhat of a mystery involved and a love story and forgiveness or lack thereof. I had to put it down to gain my composure after a couple of grisly parts. This story hit close to home for me because a similar situation happened with a close family member of mine and I can only hope and pray the \\"accuser\\" one day comes clean. It made me feel sad but good in the end-not wanting to give anything away. It's a definate must read especially with the movie coming out. The book is always better!
0321525655|5.0|When it comes to business presentations, this book is the Bible!  The illustrations are excellent, as is the content.  It isn't as much about how to do as it is about how to think.  Don't do another presentation until you read this book.  It rocks!
B000Y1H7VA|5.0|This is the version of Zeitgeist that should have been released first...well with the inclusion of the song Zeitgeist anyway. This would have been a near perfect release and made much more sense than the 20 different versions released. The three extra tracks are some of the best featured on the album.  If you already own a version of Zeitgeist then Ma Belle and the dvd are worth the 9.99 that Best Buy charged for this version. Otherwise if you can't get it at best buy then you can locate Ma Belle on one of the various pumpkins fan sites and music trading forums on the net. I say go that route other than paying double for a disc that wasn't meant to be a double dip but a directors cut. Great cd and only missing the song \\"Zeitgeist\\" to make it complete.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|i purchased the album legally off the radiohead site and definitely give this album five stars! the music is solid, thom yorke's voice is in top form, making for one of their best albums since 'Kid A'.
B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|The effort that Adam Jones, Alex Grey and contributing artist that produced this DVD video of Vicarious is worth every penny plus more. The Animation is Disturbing yet appealing to the eye. The quality of this video as seen on Youtube is very poor and doesn't give off the same vibe.
B000FGGE7C|1.0|i could not agree more with some of the earlier statements. i thought they couldn't make a movie starring milla that i wouldn't watch repetedly...i was wrong. the one positive thing is that this was the first movie i watched on my blu-ray player. i'm telling you that it was visually stunning!! i have watched several movies since and nothing has even come close. you feel like you can just reach out and touch her. that would be a good thing if it weren't for the fact that the story is so, so, so bad that if you could touch her, you would smack her and say \\"how wasted were you when you read and agreed to do this script?\\". just so you understand that i am not some pretentious movie fanboy, being overly judgmental... i own and love \\"island of the alive\\",\\"dark star\\",\\"barbarella\\"...you get the idea.
B000E6EJAC|5.0|ALL THE YOUNG DUDES, produced by glam-rocker David Bowie, was the band's first success after three years of great albums which nobody bought. Bowie had offered Mott two songs, the first of which they turned down, but the second of which (the title track) they accepted, because they felt it fit their sound and style, and the result was a song that became an anthem for gay people everywhere. Ironically, however, the band members themselves were all straight, so they had some trouble getting used to this. There are other great songs here, too, including a remake of the Velvet Underground's \\"Sweet Jane\\" which is better than the original, and guitarist Mick Ralphs's \\"Ready For Love\\", which he'd remake with Bad Company in 1974. This album is absolutely essential, but an even better one would come in 1973 when Mott ditched Bowie, produced themselves, and came up with the elegaic/cautionary MOTT.
B0000073NC|4.0|When the Scorpions made Lonesome Crow, they borrowed the style of heavy metal blues jamming that Black Sabbath originated and made it even heavier and arguably more frightening and atmospheric than what was featured on the groundbreaking Sabbath debut.  However with Fly to the Rainbow, the Scorpions updated their sound (probably unintentionally so because the rock scene was changing by the mid 70's and nobody could help it) and made their songwriting a little tighter, even if they removed some of the powerful heavy metal guitar work and dark blues from Lonesome Crow in exchange for slightly cheesier songwriting ideas quite similar to Uriah Heep.    The title song is the most obvious Uriah Heep comparison.  Even though the song starts off as a fast-paced and melodic acoustic diddy reminiscent of many folk rock artists of the time, the song quickly switches into a more hard rock direction based on a simple (but pretty heavy) guitar riff.  My feelings are that it sounds to me like the Scorpions obviously took some elements of Uriah Heep, Wishbone Ash and Robin Trower and tried writing a sophisticated, multi-part progressive rock track... and for the most part it works, however the repetitive vocal melody around 2 minutes in lasts entirely too long and should have been shortened dramatically.      The final five minutes of this track shows the band imitating Robin Trower in a VERY convincing way because the guitar work sounds exactly like him.  Nothing you haven't heard before- the second half of the title song is more post-psychedelic hard rock that so many other bands were doing back then.      Despite being highly derivative, it's still a pretty good song that definitely benefits from being exceptionally melodic if nothing else.    One of the most beautiful moments I've ever heard from the Scorpions occurs on \\"Far Away\\".  This must be what went through God's mind when he created the universe!  Just a brilliant way to sing a very meaningful and sincere ballad.  It's not a ballad in that it features romantic lyrics about a boy and girl falling in love but rather, just a beautiful slice of heaven in the way the lead singer sails his vocal range and using *just* the right tone.  The 2-minute intro and the final minute of this fantastic song are just unbelievable to me.      \\"Fly People Fly\\" is a little clunky in the vocal melody department- the chorus feels awkward and out of place in comparison to the verse melody, almost like the two don't belong together.  I get the feeling the Scorpions didn't think this particular idea through very carefully.  It's an okay song- I can live with a little bit of clunkiness.  Another Uriah Heep comparison is evident upon hearing \\"They Need a Million\\".  The entire second half of the song sounds like it was influenced by their Demons & Wizards album.    The most interesting song is by FAR \\"Drifting Sun\\".  I've seriously never heard anything like it before.  I swear some of this guitar playing is reminiscent of Eddie Van Halen, which tells me Van Halen isn't quite as original as one would believe.  Not when a song like *this* was created four years before Van Halen became popular.  The pounding drum work around the halfway point, the dazzling display of guitar solos in between the verse melody, the entire \\"electric\\" feeling the song captures... I absolutely love it.    I like this album, no doubt about it.   Lonesome Crow is better though, and in fact the two albums the Scorpions released after this one are better too.
B00005M91K|5.0|This whole movie had me tensing my muscles.. It's a REALLY intense visual journey that can be inturpreted many ways. I view it as the cycle of life, and the nature of man and war.. What do you think?
B0011TQLA2|5.0|In Rainbows is a superb album.  Although my favorite album to date is OK Computer, In Rainbows is challenging that top spot.  Unfortunately, buying from Amazon will not get you Disc Two, which is awesome.
1400063515|4.0|I have nothing against long books, but I have something against books that seem to be inflated only to satisfy the writer's contractual obligations.     Overall, the key ideas are sound, but are presented in a repetitive manner. The book is short on mathematical arguments. Taleb obviously thinks of himself in hiperlatives and has disdain for (financial) mathematicians. As if all of them were not aware of the fat tail problem and freak events. Believe me, they are.     This is not a good book to learn about the reasons for the collapse of LTCM or any other hedge fund.      I like the book for it's general advice on exposure to positive swans.

0375842209|5.0|This magnificent book about one German girl's experiences during WWII deserves a place on every book shelf.  Though marketed as a teen book, it far transcends that limited label.  The message, the sensitivity of the subject matter, and the stunning prose mark this as a powerful novel of the Holocaust.  This book is by turns gritty and ugly and redemptive, but is it always real and always gripping.<br /><br />That the narrator is Death lends even greater poignancy to the sad tale that slowly and artfully unfolds through the novel.  Death often offers commentary on both the life of the Book Thief and on the war itself in a voice that sends chills down the spine: \\"An abridged roll call for 1942: 1. The desperate Jews- their spirits on my lap as we sat on the roof, next to the steaming chimneys. 2. The Russian soldiers- taking only small amounts of ammunition, relying on the fallen for the rest of it. 3. The soaked bodies of a French coast- beached on the shingle and sand.\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this extraordinary book to adult readers; it goes far beyond the scope of most teen novels.
B000002TWN|5.0|It's been 12 years since I purchased this album and I finally write my review! I'm J-RE, an R&B artist out now and I honestly have to break it down for you in a simple sentence. D'angelo was my only inspiration for even wanting to break into this crazy industry. I was 14 when brown suga dropped and all I could remember was how cool this dude was. I listened to this album and studied this album and wrote and played keys and really used this album as a blue print. I am grateful for this album and honestly is the only album that I really still listen to like that (Voodoo as well)     I don't need to write a crazy long review here. Just want to tell D'angelo thank you for exposing this to the world, cause without you, there would be no J-RE and that's real. Honestly if I hadn't listened to this album I would have not really cared to make music like this. I mean I was musically inclined since I was 8 but \\"Brown Suga\\" made me think...\\"Man this is the best music I've ever heard. I need to do this\\"    This album is a hands down classic
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter the 1st Season is like a good book.  You can't put it down.  We bought the first season after hearing so much about the show. We couldn't watch just one series and then wait until another time to watch another.  We would watch three or four series a night.  We ended up watching the 12 series in three nights.  We are anixous for the 2nd Season to come out.
B000P0J024|5.0|I bought the original album when it came out in the late 1980's, but never bought Vol 3. This package reissues Vol 1 with Vol 3 and a DVD containing the videos for the singles and a short documentary as well.<br /><br />To see and hear this supergroup on the DVD was emotional. George Harrison was always behind Lennon/McCartney in discussions about the Beatles but when he did things well he was amongst the very best. Now of course he's gone along with Roy Orbison as well. 'Handle With Care' features these two on vocals with Harrisons distinctive guitar slide guitar prominant as well. This is a magical track. I've been a long time fan of Orbison and his amazing voice and as one of the band says on the DVD to have arguably the greatest pop singer (Orbison) and the greatest lyryic writer (Dylan) in the same group was just incredible.<br /><br />All the guys contribute memorable parts to both albums and whilst the second album suffers from the loss of Orbison (any album would) its still a fine recording. The DVD isn't that long but its certainly of historical interest, and one I shall watch again.<br /><br />Enjoy the legends, we probably won't ever see a band like this again.

1416523359|1.0|Boring.  Silly.  As mentioned by other reviewers, the book is full of annoying baby-talk private language, but what other reviewers have failed to mention is that the meaning of the words are not clear...I can only assume that the definitions will be revealed before the end.  And I mean this is on every page.  The words Bool or Blood-bool are used constantly, with only the vaguest hints of what they might mean.  I understand that we are getting a \\"glimpse\\" inside the private language of a personal relationship, but, please, Mr. King, give us some sense of bearing!  I hardly ever put a book down without finishing it (I have finished some truly crappy books in my time), but this one is tempting me beyond belief.  It it were written by another author, I would have thrown in the towel quite a while ago.  Some of the reviews mentioned that the book gets better at the end, and as I mentioned in the title of this review, I will edit this review if that is the case (and if I am able to finish it).  The premise held such promise.  Boo on the execution so far.    Michael Chabon, you owe me ten dollars.

B000002J0B|5.0|This album ranks among Led Zeppelin's best efforts. However, it is not the same album as its magnum-opus predecessor, Zoso. Those of you who are expecting masterpieces such as Stairway, Black Dog, or When the Levee Breaks, be forwarned. Think of this album not in the same light but rather a different feel that is just as equal. The only thing that would have enhanced the record further is if the band included the actual title song. It then would be the only Led Zeppelin album with one. It is an extremely diverse record from rock ballads (Rain Song), reggae (D'yer Mak'er), and to funk(Crunge). One song that I can do without is No Quarter. I know I will take some heat for this, but it seemed to stop the momentum on the second side between Dyer Maker and The Ocean. No Quarter is reminiscient of Pink Floyd composition, but in bad way. It seems that drugs had taken the better part of the band when making this cut. The Crunge is a song all, but unlistenable. At least it was intended as a joke and a hats-off to James Brown or a slap to his face. I do not need to explain why the other songs are great. Enjoy the album.    Good Songs: Dyer Maker, The Song Remains the Same, The Ocean, Over the Hills and Far Away.    Ok songs: Dancing Days, The Rain Song    Bad Songs: No Quarter, The Crunge

B000000OA6|4.0|What blows me and other people away about this album is not just that it was Queen's last studio recording together (not counting the posthumous Made in Heaven), but how powerful the band sounds.  Not to belabor a point, but Freddie Mercury's death soon after this would make this a very poignant release.  To the end, he remained very much the life and soul of the band - present in every track, and delivering some of his most passionate vocals.  When rock stars like Hendrix, Michael Hutchence, etc die, it's usually unexpected.  Freddie knew his days were numbered, but kept going.<br /><br />The album as a whole is refreshing.  Innuendo saw the band rebounding from a so-so album (The Miracle) with a killer title track - Innuendo - which encapsulates the band's adventurous journeys, while invoking Led Zeppelin's Kashmir.  Playful, experimental, dark, conventional - all the usual Queen elements are served up here in this epic and bittersweet album, which showcases tight musicianship and great production from track one to the end.<br /><br />The album is also somewhat biographical.  The Show Must Go On was truly a rock swansong if ever there was one.  I'm Going Slightly Mad; These Are the Days of Our Lives; Don't Try So Hard are all great songs which seem to reflect Freddie's introspection.  It's difficult listening to this when I think about the music videos - which reveal Freddie in a fragile state.  But as much as the body was failing, the voice was very much inside and alive.<br /><br />If anything's different about this from other Queen albums which veered from being pompous, romantic to rock - Innuendo comes across with a more melancholy and dark edge.  Even throwaway tracks like Headlong and Hitman feel undercut by the reality that was happening beyond the album.  A fitting farewell to a great singer and band.
B000VH3FV8|5.0|What is with all the nit-picking about this box set?  The purpose of this box set is to give an overview of Luther Vandross's career, and it does an excellent job of that. This set DOES have some rarities, yet the hardcore fans complain there are not enough.  That was not the purpose of this collection.  It is not a B-sides/rarities compilation, but rather an anthology of his career. There are complaints that not all of Vandross's charted hits are here.  Yes, not all of the songs that charted below number 60 on the Billboard charts are here, but it's not a major oversight and it's not like the collection leaves off his major classics.      The sound is excellent.  The '80s hits sound crisp and fresh as ever. The liner notes are well-written and not exhaustive. Songs come in extended or original form, not cut up or edited like so many other compilations. How can you complain when you get the rare, extended version of \\"Never Too Much\\"? Certainly not me.  You get excellent live versions of \\"Searching\\", \\"Always & Forever\\" and \\"A House is Not A Home\\".  You even get a sample of his producing abilities, with the full-length version of Aretha Franklin's \\"Jump to It\\". I think that's a smart move on the compilers' part; Vandross was a huge fan of divas like Aretha and he was prolific in his production skills.     It's rare that I can listen to a box set all the way through.  Yet \\"Love, Luther\\" is such a consistently good listen, that you can enjoy it straight through from disc one to disc four.  In fact, the collection just gets better and better with each disc, and each disc stands on its own.     Even if some of Luther's music sounds very much from the era it was recorded, he was a talented artist who had great taste in song choices and production.  This production really is a labor of love.
1591396190|2.0|Aristotle tells in his Poetics about the figures of speech that can be used by poets and orators, then  he adds: \\"It is a great thing to make a fitting use of each of one of these devices, but the greatest thing of all is being a master of metaphors. This alone can be gotten from no one else, and is the sign of born talent, since to use metaphor well is to have a sense for likeness.\\"<br /><br />Conversely, to use a bad metaphor is a sure sign of poor taste. And to use it repeatedly and in an incoherent manner not only demonstrates lack of poetical sense, but also denotes poor reasoning.<br /><br />In their essay, Kim and Mauborgne use the evocative powers of the ocean to help corporate executives craft innovative business strategies. This is altogether fitting: the sea is the mirror of man's soul, and navigating on uncharted waters has always been a powerful metaphor of human endeavor. Management discourse is replete with terms borrowed from navigation, from being at the helm to toiling in the hold.<br /><br />Indeed, as argued by the authors, corporate strategy would gain from distancing itself from the vocabulary of war-making and from using bellicose metaphors, and should instead develop the analogy with the art of seafaring. Forget Sun Tzu and Clausewitz, welcome to Bougainville and Cook. Captains of industry are more like masters and commanders of vessels riding with the tide of consumers' demand than generals engaged in a battle with the competition.<br /><br />The Blue Ocean therefore provides a good catch phrase for a spirit of adventure, endless possibilities, and the thrill of discovery. It is what every entrepreneur should aspire. The Red Ocean, in turn, is more difficult to construe. I have been reminded of the \\"wine-dark sea\\" of Homer, or of the River Tiber foaming with blood as in Virgil. The image here is menacing and frightening, and those waters should be avoided by all business leaders.<br /><br />Provided, of course, the seagoing vessel is the object of comparison for a business enterprise. This is not very clear in the text. The authors sometimes refer to swimming, implying that the entrepreneur is compared to a large fish, maybe a shark. Indeed, only sharks competing for a bloody prey can turn the ocean into red. But if one has to espouse the form and character of a shark, on has to behave like one. For sharks, swimming in red oceans is much better than patrolling blue ones. Blood is what they are after, and therefore they love to cruise bloody waters.<br /><br />The metaphor gets even more illogical. The authors write about creating one's blue ocean within a red ocean, they give advise on how to unlock an ocean, or they refer to the cornerstone (sic) of a blue ocean strategy. Again if you are a shark, you can create your pool of bloody water within an ocean of blue, but the reverse is nonsensical. Creating an ocean defies common sense and even artistic license. Mixing blue and red will only give you purple. And cornerstones put into any pool of water will sink to the bottom.<br /><br />Maybe I am trying to read too much into this metaphor. Like a simple melody or the silly lyrics of a song, its purpose is to stick to the mind and to become a self-evident reference. Blue and red oceans are sticky labels: even when you would like to ignore them, you cannot help but using them when you discuss their content. The reason behind this stickiness is self-reference: precisely because the image is the message, you cannot go beyond the metaphor to reach a core meaning. There is nothing beyond the call to imagination.rise. This is not very clear in the text.

B000P12LWY|5.0|Personally, I don't care if \\"The Tudors\\" is historically accurate or not.  That's just my personal preference.  I can watch and enjoy this beautifully produced Showtime series for what it is:  a great \\"romp,\\" sumptuously \\"dressed\\" and photographed.  I appreciate what the actors have accomplished here: keeping me engrossed.  IMO, the pacing, the acting, the musical score, the story, and the visual production are worth my time.  I'm happy to have it on DVD to watch again before the new season starts on March 30, 2008.<br /><br />NOTE:  FYI: There is an ERROR on the packaging of this DVD set.  Disc 2 does NOT contain Episode 7.  Episode 7 is on Disc 3 (and is not marked as such.)  I'm sure all who own this would have eventually found Episode 7, but I thought mentioning this tiny \\"glitch\\" might save someone a moment of panic, thinking, perhaps, it was not included. LOL!<br /><br />Enjoy this fine series or don't!  As many have already stated, it IS a matter of personal preference.  I agree with the person who said there is a channel for \\"history,\\" and it is called the History Channel!
B000UD08HW|5.0|I agree with others there is a great deal of grain on this blu ray.  However - if you dont lock down on that one aspect you will totally enjoy the audio and 90% of the video.

B000J103OI|2.0|I HATE Meryl Streep with a PASSION, but I received this DVD as a Christmas gift; so I felt obligated to watch this film at least once.<br />  I think Streep, who never fails to make my skin crawl, is THE WORST actress of all time. She, on the other hand, clearly thinks SHE iS THE BEST-- and she has miraculously managed to convince a lot of other people to believe it as well. Monsterous Meryl, looking like a cross between herself, Cruella De Ville, and Martha Stewart, is perfectly cast to- type as ice- queen fashion editor Miranda Prestley. Miranda expects everyone and everything in life, including hurricane weather, to be at her beck and call. I imagine Meryl expects exactly the same in her real life. Meryl and Miranda would eat Audrey Hepburn for breakfast, but since \\"PRADA\\" is not a fun \\"FUNNY FACE\\", Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, and Stanley Tucci get eaten instead. Some vain attempt is made late in the film to show a \\"human\\" side of Miranda; but fashion folks are depicted as shallow and cut-throat here, and Miranda is no exception. This is the type of role that Meryl can \\"phone in\\" by now, and that's exactly what she does.<br />  The surprise is that, if you can get past the endless screams of \\"Hail, Meryl\\"-- the film actually belongs to lovely Anne Hathaway and the supporting cast. Hathaway, Blunt, and Tucci all hold their own on screen opposite Meryl Streep surprisingly well. Hathaway plays Andrea Sachs, who takes a \\"temporary\\" job as Miranda's second assistant. Not surprisingly, Stanley Tucci gives her a fashion make-over (identical to the one Anne Hathaway received in \\"THE PRINCESS DIARIES\\") and Andrea quickly turns as shallow as the people she initially despises, and she gets caught up in the surface glamour and glitz of her job at \\"Runway Magazine.\\" Her head is temporarily turned by sexy scoundrel Simon Baker.<br /> I  kept wishing for her to get her head back on straight and return to her adorably sexy boyfriend, played by Adrian Grenier. I also kept wishing for her to tell Miranda to go to hell and throw coffee in her face. She doesn't. Since Andrea is always fetching coffee for Miranda, I kept wishing she would wake up and smell the Starbucks!! She does, but it takes her a terribly  LONG time!!!!to tell Miranda to go to hell and throw coffee in her face. She doesn't.

B000WC3AJE|4.0|That's Entertainment in Blu-Ray 1080p. Should be wonderful. Should be sharp.  But it actually is an immense dissapointment on Blu-Ray. Most BW clips are incredibley grainy. There are several audio drop-outs. People have argued with me that it's because it is supposed to be there. Baloney. In this day of Blu-Ray, there shouldn't be any distraction from the art, because of technical problems. The same with the last release of Wizard of Oz, which was also incredibly grainy. I therefore watch the 1999 release, which has a sharp, but not grainy picuture. It is too bad because I expected \\"That's Entertainment\\", in Blu-ray to be altogether better than the DVD collection. This is my fourth version. (1984 Single TE Laserdisc,VHS, DVD) And the last. The DVD version is actually better over-all. But I will always love the content of \\"That's Entertainment.\\"
B00001OH7O|5.0|With \\"Honky Dory,\\" David Bowie let his voice come out front and center. Everyone knows the song \\"Changes,\\" which is an excellent example of his vocal skills. Yet the rest of this album exhibits Bowies range of emotion as well as his song-writing skills. Mick Ronson takes a step back in this recording, the soaring soungs of his guitar having been premonitioned with the previous recording, \\"The Man Who Sold the World.\\" Interestingly, Rick Wakeman steps forward on the piano, accenting Bowie's singing as well as his composition in a way that seems flawless. The songs are simple diddys in many ways, yet their charm is ingratiating. Bowie's story telling is taking shape here in a way that will explode with \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" and \\"Alladin Sane.\\" We get a clear look at this with \\"Andy Warhol.\\" The accoustic guitar on this title is exciting, enchanting, and even arousing. It's one of the few accoustic guitar songs than inspire dance. If you are retracing Bowie's history, this album will grow on you.
B00122O34O|5.0|Juno is a gentle, sweet, smart and moving comedy.  It's a teen flick that works for adults, or an adult flick that works for teens.  The soundtrack is the perfect background (and sometimes foreground) to what goes on in the film, but it also stands alone quite nicely.  Most of the songs on the album are quiet, indie, folkie, and acoustic, like the Kimya Dawson songs (three of 'em) which are idiosnycractic and wonderful.  Kimya Dawson (formerly of the Moldy Peaches who are also represented here) reminds me ALOT of the Be Good Tanyas (which is intended as a compliment), especially on Tire Swing. There are, however, also songs from the Kinks and Buddy Holly and Mott the Hoople which are not acoustic-y folkie.  Go out and see the movie and I'm betting you will come back for the music.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I saw \\"The Prestige\\" last night, having already read the book. Although, I already knew the details of the plot, that it was the story of two rival magicians in 19th Century London, and the secrets of each of their magic tricks, I still found this film to be well worth watching. In fact, I found the film to be an improvement on the book, as the film leaves the main plot twists to the final scene, whereas the book reveals them earlier.<br /><br />Although, I am not a big fan of Christopher Nolan (I hated what he did to \\"Insomnia\\"), I think he did an excellent job of writing and directing this film. It is well paced and although Nolan reveals enough to solve the riddles of the film, nothing is blatently obvious. As usual, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Cain also turn in excellent performances (when I read the book, I wondered if Nolan had been correct to cast Bale as Bowden and Jackman as Angier - I thought it might have been better the other way around - but after seeing the film, I think he got it right).<br /><br />This movie is well worth watching, and if you haven't read the book, it is probably worth watching twice, just to see what you missed the first time around.

0307387178|5.0|This is a chronicle of an idealistic youth gone extreme. Its tragedy is something that could happen to anyone of this young man's idealism.  Was I myself this way when younger? Yes and no. I admit, I did not have that extra component one might blame that lead to such a tragic end. What we see here are the cracks in McCandless's character that lead to this devasting tragedy. Here we get a glimpse of the emotional wounds in his parents and their all-too-real struggles and how this young guy attempted to ferret his soul out of his interior landscape by venturing into the outer, wilder, more ruthlessly dangerous one.      Did I pick this up because of the recent film? Of course. I was so riveted, I had to know more. Why? Oh, God, why?     It's so easy to write this young man off--but I sense the deep stirrings in his soul. Loved this read and recommend.

0380729407|4.0|This novel displays all of the trademarks that have established Bradbury as one of the premiere writers of our time.  His prose is captivating, his use of allegory is brilliant and his descriptive imagery is perfectly fitting.  The characters are memorable, the plot progesses at a satisfactory pace and the book's message of good/evil, human nature, youth, desire, self-awareness and more rings out clearly.  I can see where some reviewers have found Bradbury's style here a bit difficult to get into, but if you go with him, he will take you on an unforgettable journey.  Highly recommended to all Brabury fans.  If you're new to Bradbury, this is one of his more notable works (though I might recommend \\"Martian Chronicles\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" as a starting point), just be patient and see it through to the end--you will not be disappointed.
B00006D295|5.0|This was a great Christmas gift.  Just what my friend wanted and it got here in plenty of time.
0553213105|3.0|This book was OK, but not nearly the great classic that it is supposed to be, in my opinion.  My biggest impression is relief that I did not live in that era, when the most a woman could hope for was to be good at needlepoint and marry well.  I understand that is how it was, but I still felt nauseous reading about all the silly, manipulative man hunting tactics of the women.  The dialoge was sometimes very witty, but other times rather difficult to follow because of the older style English.<br /><br />I also could not stand Darcy; any man who has the audacity to say within earshot of a woman that she is too ugly to tempt him or to dance with him is a jerk, period.  I would tell him to take a hike if he came around.  I don't understand how women find men like Darcy, Heathcliff, and Rochester to be attractive; cold indifferent, sarcastic, and cruel men don't interest me in the slightest and I can't for the life of me understand how they get to be such great romantic interests in these type of novels.<br /><br />The main character, Elizabeth, is different from the others and is very likeable; she redeems the book from being a 1 star.  I admire her intelligence and refusal to go along the societies norms.  I don't understand how she begins to like Darcy, but I guess that is just me.  Elizabeth's ability to spar with Darcy and hold her own was the best part of the book.<br /><br />This book is is not as good as \\"Jane Eyre\\" but is better than \\"Wuthering Heights\\" in my opinion.  A decent read, but not a rave.
B000HT3P7E|4.0|Ever since FRIENDS called it a day I haven't really been tuning in to much TV sitcom stuff. HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER and [[ASIN:B00005JOHC Two and a Half Men - The Complete First Season]] are just about the only sitcoms I've kept an eye on. Of the two, I like HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER just a bit better. I think it's got more heart, and it's certainly introduced \\"Awesome!\\" back into prime-time vocabulary. Anyway, its season one hooked me in.<br /><br />That same old premise: a bunch of friends wending their way thru life and love in N.Y.C. Ted Mosby (the pleasant looking Josh Radnor) is at the heart of the show, the idealistic, wide-eyed romantic and our point-of-view character. Lily (BUFFY's Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (FREAK & GEEK's Jason Segel) are the cute couple and Ted's roommates. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) is the subversive buddy, and, c'mon, it's always nice to have one in the pack, right? Robin (beautiful Cobie Smulders) is the newcomer to the gang, and the dangling romantic interest for Ted. Most of the characters dwell in an apartment right above a bar, so you can imagine where they most hang out.<br /><br />This series uses a gimmick in which, in the year 2030, an off-camera older Ted (voiced by Bob Saget) tells his future kids how he met their mother. It's taking a really long time for Older Ted to tell this story. Sweetness and snarkiness consistently hobnob in these episodes. From Ted's old-fashioned romantic leanings and Lily and Marshall's steady relationship to Barney's casual immorality and narcissism. The show even makes effective use of quick comedy cuts ala FAMILY GUY. But the big question is, of course, will Ted and Robin ever get together?<br /><br />Just check out the cast episode commentaries, and you can tell these folks like each other. Even though the main story arc centers on Ted, this is pretty much an ensemble cast. Everyone gets a slice of the spotlight. Radnor, Smulders, and Hannigan are fine, but, to me, the two people who stand out and provide most of the humor are scene-stealers Segel and Harris. Jason Segel's character is a sweet, good-natured, shambling kind of dude, a looming kid at heart who also does a mean robot. Well, okay, his robot sucks. But dude's funny.<br /><br />An indispensable ingredient to the show's success is the energetic and smarmy Neil Patrick Harris ([[ASIN:B00076YOZY Doogie Howser, M.D. - Season One]], [[ASIN:B00068WOH8 Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle (Unrated Extended Edition)]]). The show's creators had originally imagined Barney as more of a manic Jack Black type, but Harris' gung-ho audition apparently made them do a swift one-eighty, and the rest is \\"legendary.\\" Now I can't get all these Barney-isms out of my noggin, from \\"Suit up!\\" to \\"Have you met Ted?\\" to, yes, \\"legendary.\\" Old Doogie, more than anyone else on this show, keeps the season-long romantic arc from being too saccharine.<br /><br />ANGEL fans might be stoked to see Amy Acker guest star in one episode (\\"Come On\\") and Alexis Denisof, who's Hannigan's hubby in real, appear in several episodes as Robin's co-anchor Sandy Rivers. Also memorable is Ashley Williams as Ted's cool culinary girlfriend Victoria.<br /><br />Even though the show loses steam in the later episodes - and I felt the final episode underwhelmed (Rain dance? Really?) - the dropoff isn't that significant. And, throughout, HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER retains its heart. Several standout episodes are the \\"Pilot\\" ('cause it's the friggin' pilot), \\"Okay Awesome\\" (the sub-title show), \\"The Pineapple Incident\\" (Ted gets drunk, but remains \\"vomit free since '93\\"), \\"The Limo\\" (trapped in a limo with crazy Moby), and Game Night\\" (the origin of Barney).<br /><br />HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - SEASON ONE includes \\"Video Yearbook\\" (the 20-minute-long behind the scenes featurette) and \\"Happy Hour\\" (9 minutes worth of outtakes, and pretty funny). There are cast & crew audio commentaries on six episodes, and here's the thing: If you're looking for insights and background into the series, then select the writers' episode commentaries, although these cats were kind of boring and annoying. If you want comfy camaraderie with random babbletalk, then select the cast commentaries. You don't learn much from the cast, but they were fun to listen to.<br /><br />Wait a mo.

B0000VCZK2|5.0|Alien Quadrilogy  DVD<br /><br />This consists of two discs for each film, the original and an alternate version (more on that below) on the first disk, and collections of approximately 2 hours of featurettes and other bonuses on the second disc. The ninth disc is a hodgepodge of trailers and other items from previous DVD and laser disk versions. Although the extras have been released in a variety of forms over several years (the John Hurt documentary 'The Alien Saga', being the latest), THIS is the definitive version.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000ILDD Alien: 20th Anniversary Edition [Award Series]]] (see my review). If you haven't seen this classic film, then you must be living under a rock. The collection includes the original theatrical version (which I prefer) and the \\"Director's Cut\\", notable for its inclusion of the controversial captain-cocooned by alien scene (controversial because from the Alien mythology developed in later films, we know that only the massive queen can lay eggs). I prefer the original (which is actually 1 minute longer), and interestingly enough, it appears that Ridley Scott prefers the original as well. The making of featurettes is extensive and reveals Giger's extensive participation and how what was originally expected to receive a b-movie budget became one of the very few examples where Fox studios followed the vision with a classic.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000G6BM00 Aliens]] (see my review). This is the only sequel I know of that is rated higher than the original. This time, the \\"Special Edition\\" version (also on the previous 'Alien Legacy' box set) is a superior experience and exactly is how upstart director James Cameron (who had written the script prior to the release of 'The Terminator') wanted to release the film, but was constrained entirely by time limits. The result is additional scenes featuring the colonists and Ripley's family lost to the time she spent in hypersleep. As with the first installment, the featurettes are interesting and thorough, although the Viet Nam War metaphor is not as thoroughly explored with Cameron as has been in other releases.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000ILDF Alien 3]] (see my review). As a fan of the franchise, this was perhaps the most anticipated part of this new box set. The \\"working print\\" of the film (the longest of all the versions here, and complete with subtitles for missed sound editing), adds a depth to the film that was not in the original. That is, the arrival of Ripley and the characters are covered much more thoroughly, the alien creature is begotten by an oxen with a much more original look, there is an additional plot twist arising from the nature of the inhabitants (criminally delusional), and there is no ridiculously-timed chest-buster scene at the end. Still, the film is a flawed masterpiece. The film is better appreciated in light of the bad situation first-time director David Fincher had been placed in - not the least of which is an incomplete script during production and a set that had already been constructed for the ill-conceived \\"wooden planet/monetary\\" vision of the previously assigned director. In this sense, the three production featurettes come across as almost an apology/tribute to Fincher. (NOTE: Fincher is the only director who is not interviewed on the box set.)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000ILDG Alien Resurrection]] (see my review). What happens when you put the French director of 'Amelie' (Jean-Pierre Jeaunet) in charge of an alien movie? Well, foreign/art movies were all the craze in the last 1990s, so . . . Fox studios thought, \\"Why not?\\" In the end, many fans of the franchise did not appreciate the obviously satirical slant on this final installment. The opening scene and ending scenes (the only additions of substance) on the extended version make the film even more tongue-in-cheek. Despite the French director and crew's obvious regard for the original 'Alien' (as documented in the featurettes), armed with the return of Sigourney Weaver and the addition of superstar Winona Ryder, the director ultimately made a quirky, campy action film. But in the end, it was the last quarter of the script that makes this the weakest of all the installments by far. Postscript to Fox studios: if you had given Fincher this much creative freedom, you would have had a third masterpiece.<br /><br />This is a must have set for fans of Alien.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Alien, Sigourney weaver, and the slimy reptilian creature, which might be back some day.

This novel encompasses nearly half of the the Fourteenth Century, a time when England's feudal economy was transformed. Serfs subject to manorial courts managed to find freedom from indenture and acquire freehold tenancies which gave them the right to the King's justice. Such a change in relationships between manor and King enabled England to create modern agrarian, mercantile and industrial economies and to become the preeminent world power for nearly five hundred years.    Worlds come to an end during this period. Follett carefully and brilliantly uses the fictional bishopric of Kingsbridge to chart the progress of secular and ecclesiastic institutions under stress from war and plague.     On top of this history lesson is a great love story between Caris, the reluctant mother prioress of the nunnery and Merthin, the brilliant architect builder. We also have the mystery of Brother Thomas, a knight whose last battle and injuries compelled him to enter the monastery at Kingsbridge, for reasons unknown. Brilliant characters both good and evil as well as those somewhere in-between come and go through these pages like old friends or mortal foes.    In my lifetime, few books of this length (1,000+ pages) have kept me as engrossed.
0316067598|5.0|This morning I finished the last 200 pages of Marcus Luttrell's \\"Lone Survivor\\". I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I won't give details, but in my mind it is a 'must read' for any who have not yet read it. The culmination is Operation Redwing in 2005. Nothing could make me more proud of the country I live in & the people of Texas.    Alan Edwards
B000YENUI6|5.0|Incredible film - very well acted (Viggos mannerisms and accent are scarily accurate, even his Russian is very very passable), it's very violent but its violence really serves the plot. It treats the subject matter with eerie respect and insight into the life of the Russian mob. Terrifying.
0345494997|4.0|Having visited Taliesin and Oak Park, I knew something of this story and was interested to see what the author would do with this material.  The book raises many questions in the process of telling the story.  Should a genius be allowed such leeway (or is it leaway?), he can dispense with all the conventions of living in society?  How much should a woman be allowed to abandon in search of finding true love, inspiring a genius, developing her own personality?  The book doesn't really give any answers to these questions but one can understand the implications of these dilemmas. The reader will learn that celebrity gossip, insane murder sprees, and infidelity are not recent developments.  The dramatic tragedy that the book build us to does not have a lot to do with any of these questions.  As with other historical fiction, the book leads me to want to read the history behind the story and see what the author has added and reshaped.  I wondered what Wright's career would have been like if he hadn't become involved with Mrs. Cheney.  Those who don't know much about Wright might be able to enjoy the book on its own terms, but those who know the background will find the book interesting.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|Sonically, I think _In Rainbows_ is the most interesting Radiohead album. There is a lot of depth and quite a startling amount of originality here, for a band fairly well into their career, even a band as revered and with the proven track record Radiohead possesses. Some have summarized the sounds on offer here by painting this album as a kind of intersection between the experimental, sound collage electronica phase of their career and the vaguely arena ready, immaculately inward looking rock of old. While I think this misses the mark somewhat (Rainbows veers towards the former more and has new elements), this is a fairly good guide to what to expect.<br /><br />'15 Step' explodes with a heavily distorted beat, which is gradually infiltrated by a delicate, lush guitar lick, and then embellished by Yorke's lilting, melancholy vocals. The melodies are strong but subtle, the structure unconventional, and as such quite a lot of listens are required to get a hold on the track. This certainly sets the tone for the album, although we are thrown an immediate curve ball with 'Bodysnatchers' which is almost visceral compared to much else here: suffice to say it washes out the speakers like a poweful jam and feels more aggressive then any other song. Elsewhere, 'Nude' channels 'Exit Music' and displays a fragile beauty, while 'All I Need', with its hot car metaphors, driving, pulsing organic beat and claustrophobic atmosphere functions as an effective centrepiece of sorts, quite striking in its intensity and dense menace.<br /><br />The second half of the album is even better. 'Faust Arp' is a gorgeous bridging piece, with am ingenious melody and hordes of entrancing guitar licks. 'Reckoner' is my favourite track, a firm beat anchoring an impossibly emotive melody, Yorke's practically wordless vocal only adding to the mystery. A sparse, affecting masterpiece. Add to this the angular magic of 'Jigsaw Falling Into Place', which feels confrontational and almost out of place, and the thoughtful 'Videotape' and you have the landscape of perfection.<br /><br />So each track has something to offer, and the record as a whole just shines with ideas: the well placed, syncopated beats behind everything, the great guitar interplay and the admirable restraint and invention in the playing, the powerful vocals and the subtle touches of sound and texture which add so much to the whole. Insular, memorable, addictive beyone belief and oh-so assured, _In Rainbows_ is one for the ages.Videotape' and you have the landscape of perfection.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is the first \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" movie I have bought, and I don't plan on buying another.  I like this movie in black and white, in fact, I think it lends it a lot of charm.  The quality of this edition is very good, but keeps just enough of it's old-timey quality to make you feel cozy watching it on a snowy December night.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This album will probably be notorious mostly for it's method of distribution (the album has been availiable for download via the band's website with option to pay whatever you choose), but is also among the best modern rock releases in years, and certainly as good or better than \\"Hail To The Thief\\", although perhaps not the mega-classic that was \\"OK Computer\\".<br /><br />\\"In Rainbows\\" shows a very influential and widely lauded band coming into maturity, confident of their sound, approach, and style, while at the same time experimenting here and there as they always do. Thom Yorke's vocals are chill-inducing, and the endless battle over whethere guitar or electronica \\"wins\\" seems to have been settled at a draw. The burbling techno always underneath Radiohead's surface is still there, but there is a good balance of York's textural guitar washes and stark arpeggiated chords on top. And, of course, the post-modern, ambiguous vibe is present, but this release seems less mechanistic and dystopian than, say, \\"Kid A\\". All the elements of this talented and important band semm to have reached equilibrium at last. A big success, and a great rock album which may perhaps serve as a model for digital distribution in the future....recommended.
1596912855|4.0|Jane Hayes has a serious problem. And that problem is an obsession -- an obsession with Mr. Darcy, the immortal hero of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.<br /><br />When a well-off great-aunt gives Jane a vacation to a Regency-era resort in England, Jane hopes she can finally overcome this obsession of hers. But as she finds herself dressed to the nines in time period apparel and flirting in true Austen fashion with the ever-charming male actors, fantasy and reality blend together until the two are indistinguishable.<br /><br />This novel, while at times a little unbelievable, was wholly enjoyable and amusing. Not lacking in wit or intelligence, AUSTENLAND is a carefree and lighthearted story that will delight even the most die-hard Austen fans.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  The Compulsive Reader
0783225733|5.0|There is something exquisite about this movie.  A gentle, understated movie that deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture but didn't get it.  It is near perfect and everyone does their part.  No grandstanding, no over the top performances but wonderful ensemble acting.  Ron Howard has never been better as a director.  No unnecessary special effects, only what is needed and the music is soft and barely noticeable, yet very necessary - where are the big egos in this movie?  Doing what is needed and nothing more.  They did a wonderful job of it and this film will live on as a classic for a long time.
1594489505|5.0|This is an incredible book and I could not put it down, read it in one day.  I idenfied with these women and it broke my heart.  I immediatly researched charitable organizations that benefit women in war torn areas.  Women for Women if you are interested.
1592332803|5.0|This is perhaps the best baking book I have ever come across vegan, or not.  It's beautifully done with pictures, tips, stories, and background to baking without animal products.  I think it would definitely be very useful in finding recipes for any occasion.  I have tried several so far and they come out perfect.  In the beginning she goes over all the different ways to replace eggs, milk, and fat.  It's also great because she advocates a whole foods diet, so there's nothing too processed in any of the recipes.  Whether or not they are labeled vegan, these recipes are certainly healthier alternatives to traditional baked goods without skimping out on any flavor!  Have I sold you the book yet?
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Excellent music, love the venue, great sound and what a set of musicians. Can you imagine Bonnie Raitt singing background! Roy's voice is so sweet. This takes me back a few years and I love it.
034544678X|5.0|This book will give you great insight into your behavior and the behavior of your dog. It is the best book I have read so far on dog behavior in my search for training books for new dog owners like myself.    It is not a training book, but it will make any training you do more effective because you will understand how human and dog communications/interactions differ and you will be able to better apply any training methods you use.    I really do feel this book should be read by every dog owner. The insight and understanding you gain from reading this book are invaluable. Please do get and read this book.
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Excellent value at $17-$20.  24 remastered audio tracks on CD, and 20 DVD video songs on the concert compilation DVD.    Nice track list for a greatest hits collection.  Covers their entire era and is nice to have until I can add the remastered CD's.  The DVD video concert compliation is nothing necessarily new, but it's a tremendous bonus if you don't own any of their DVD's.    Sure if you have most or all of their previous DVD's and remastered CD's, box set etc...., why bother? Considering their music isn't downloadable, and the fact I only have them on vinyl, I really needed this for now to get the Zeppelin fix on a 5.1 system etc..., and am very happy with it.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|finally I found a copy of this movie in Black and White! So much better than the colorized version...

I literally could not put this book down, and read the whole thing in seven hours. I was completely drawn into the story and felt every pain and emotion as the characters did. You will not be disappointed with this read, it is simply amazing.
0895260131|5.0|I am buying several copies of this book and I am going to give it to all my old History Professors.I hate the way they propagandizing students into white guilt.  I really an looking into suing my University.The need to as they say    \\" be held accountable for their brainwashing of students.    \\"TREASON\\"  A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and he carries his banners openly. But the traitor moves among those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the galleys, heard in the very hall of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor--he speaks in the accents familiar to his victims, and wears their face and their garment, and he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation--he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of a city--he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to be feared.......Cicero, 42 B.C.E.
0307387151|1.0|The first three chapters are so aggravatingly descriptive- from the weather to the fountain to the grounds,etc- that I was often thrown from the initial thought and I found myself skimming through to find some substance to the actual storyline.  Parts two and three were easier reads but still a little too drawn out.  And of course a disappointing conclusion.
B00006HAZG|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. I think every part was cast perfectly. Daniel Radcliffe is absolutely adorable. Mr and Miss, Murdstone are perfect. Exactly as I imagined. Mr and Mrs. Mcawber, Uriah Heep, Mr. creakle, Mr. Dick and of course Miss. Trotwood are brilliant. I highly recommend this to anyone. They cut some of the slower parts but kept in my three favorite parts: \\"So I lost her. So I saw her afterwards, in my sleep at school  a silent presence near my bed  looking at me with the same intent face  holding up her baby in her arms.\\", \\"If you please, maam, if you plaese Aunt, I am your nephew, David Copperfild\\", and of course the scene with Uriah Heep going down. I do wish they would have kept in the part with Mr. Mell. Where David does not stick up for him, but what can you do.    Anyway I highly recommend this DVD.
B00005JPTI|4.0|I am sure that most people have, at some time, considered what it would be like to be the last person on earth.  Surely, the benefits of complete freedom would be overwhelmed by the appalling loneliness.  It must be like solitary confinement without the walls.  And solitary confinement has been known to send its victims mad.<br /><br />\\"I am Legend\\" is a variance on the theme of the last man on earth.  Will Smith plays a modern day Robinson Crusoe alone within the decaying streets on Manhattan.  It is here that the film really is at its best.  The computer generated images of a ruined New York are remarkable.  There are weeds growing through the streets, deer roaming at will and even a pride of lions within this open air menagerie.<br /><br />It is Smith's role in life to both find other living humans as well as finding a cure for the virus that has seemingly destroyed the human race.  Smith plays this part brilliantly.  He is dedicated to his task while assisted by his trusty dog.  He is a determined man but one who is nearing the brink as he talks to shop mannequins and seems inordinately lonely.<br /><br />Around the half way point of the film, the viewer is introduced to some real objects of fear.  The virus that has wrought so much destruction on the human race has also led to the creation of a race of horrible mutants.  In this regard, I was reminded of HG Wells's \\"The Time Machine\\" where the Morlock live beneath the earth but come out at night to play on the peaceful Eloi.  With the use of modern cinematic techniques, these mutants can be made to be truly vile.<br /><br />The film's conclusion was not entirely expected.  Suffice to say that Smith plays a hero.  His role in the film is quite stunning.  Overall, I enjoyed this film.  It had moments that grabbed the viewer's attention.  In fact, I might take a second viewing just to tidy up some loose ends.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I purchased the Sonic Screwdriver as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old daughter. It was a huge hit! She was more excited about it than any of her other gifts. My wife and I were also very impressed with the quality of the product. It is very well made and came with its own batteries. I must admit that with the interchangeable ballpoint pen and invisible ink heads I really would love to get this as a gift myself. It is so great to see a toy that is so well made. Doctor Who fans at any age will love this product.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is an absolutely fantastic family strategy game.  I won't belabor my discussion of the game, except to say that my wife (only a 'casual boardgamer', not as hardcore like me) and two boys (ages 8 and 10) have been playing it for over a year, many dozens of times, with continued enjoyment.  I have successfully hooked other gamers in my family (brother in law, father) on it as well, so that it shares equal time with Monopoly in our family game marathons over the holidays.    The big point to take away about this new edition of the game is that, without changing any rules, the edition includes some very handy extra pieces, esp. an interlocking set of holders to fit the tiles into, which helps prevent incidental dislocations of the pieces on the board (so common with the older edition).  For those of you who have the Seafarers of Catan extension, the holding tiles are much those included in that extension (except shaped to fit the Settlers hex board).

B000ULQV0W|5.0|The movie is a great journey in which you follow Chris McCandless as he hikes around the US, refusing to get too close to anyone while trying to discover his real self.  The quote of the film \\"destroy the false self.\\"  This album is not every song in the movie, but the original songs made for the movie (as the title says \\"Music for the Motion Picture Into the Wild\\") but the songs Eddie Vedder wrote for the film.  The only one he didn't write himself was Society, but he performed it perfectly.  If you want the other songs, buy the movie and look at the artists then download them from iTunes, but if you want the amazing music that Eddie Vedder wrote solely for the film, buy this album.  It comes with sort of a picture book with lyrics for each song.  All my friends love this album, Pearl Jam fans or not.  All the emotions were captured perfectly for the film.  I recommend it for everyone who enjoys the story of a person trying to find the actual reason of their life.
B000OVLNII|5.0|I read \\"Team of Rivals\\" over a year ago, and cannot get it out of my mind.  It is far more than an excellent biography - it leaves the reader with an enduring sense of the fluidity of history - and an understanding of how lucky we were that Lincoln was so astute a judge of the men in his Cabinet.
B00005ASOI|2.0|Having read a number of reviews saying that Susperia was a true horror masterpiece, I just had to experience it for myself. What I found was definetely different from any horror film I had ever seen.    Susperia is not filmed in a typical western style. The soundtrack is overwhelmingly loud, the visuals are bright and overly colorful and the gore is graphic. Despite all that, the story is filled with plot holes, jammed together and mostly non-sensical.      Don't get me wrong. I get why its a classic of a sort but its not my cup of tea. If you have never seen it before and are new to the way Italian Cinema is shot, you may have a hard time not turning it off.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|There are too many characters and I was unsure of who most of them were until they made it obvious. I was still looking for a plot halfway through, although it was interesting enough to keep watching just to see how it ended.<br /><br />In spite of the abundance of action, it was a bit of a snoozer. There has to be more to a movie, especially one of the Bond ilk, than just a Bond actor that looks good. This one just doesn't seem to be about anything. I wouldn't mind seeing Mr. Craig in another Bond film, but one with a better storyline.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|I have been a Radiohead listener since Pablo Honey (their first album), and have listened alot of their music and fell in love with it. But this new abum even beats Ok Computer and Kid A, which are masterpieces at the same level of Dark Side of the Moon (Pink Floyd) or any other rock classic.     Trust me, if you like good music, you're going to love this one. No songs wasted!
B000YXMMAE|3.0|...it's no wonder these tracks were left off previous albums. They are quite simply inferior Radiohead tracks. Any Radiohead album must be weighed with Radiohead scales, I'm afraid. A string of five near-perfect albums may prove to be a unique feat, but it won't be six. I am of the belief that \\"Hail To The Thief\\" was the best band release of the last 20 years. You have nothing here that compels and won't let go like every note of \\"Thief.\\" Others hail an \\"understated\\", \\"quiet\\", \\"detailed\\", \\"melodic\\" shift in the band here. I just find Radiohead lite. That the tracks are culled from various points in their evolution is quite evident--you can pick out just what track goes with what album. The cumulative, binding effect of the whole (what Radiohead do so well) is lost here. It's odd to me that the band stated 3 years ago they would never again sound like they did. Surely a joke, as \\"Rainbows\\" is really nothing new. The standout is the swirling minimalism of \\"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi\\", with Thom Yorke's shimmering vocals coming in and out of focus. A love to gladly die for, he insists. I was beginning to think these guys were too good to be from our planet; here's proof they are human afterall (still darn good though). Now, guys, onto that promise about never sounding the same, huh?
B000AMPZF8|5.0|I started getting to know Muse through Black Holes. I didnt like this album as much, so I skipped to Absolution, but now that I've given it another try...wow! This one's like fine wine - just needs some time and the right mood to sink in.
1582701709|5.0|I can't help but wonder how sad the lives of the people who gave poor reviews to this video are.  The bottom line I got from this movie is that you should restate your complaints into positive statements affirming what you want.  I also learned that doubt, skepticism, negativity, and discouragement will bring you more of what you don't want.    I've already implemented some of the priinciples discussed in this DVD and have personally seen amazing results in my own life.      I must confess however, that I thought that the DVD was more informative than entertaining.  I thought it would be a movie with the concepts of the Law of Attraction woven into the story line of the movie but it was more like a very well presented seminar.    Otherwise, I'm really glad I bought the video.  I intend to make it a point to watch it frequently and share it with friends.  I've only watched it for the first time today and have already purchased three copies for friends.

0349117047|3.0|What I love about these books is the immersion into the Botswana way of life from the Botswana point of view.  McCall Smith not only visited Botswana, he lived there for some time, and it shows in every detail.  The main character's being a detective lets us pry into the lives of others in her culture.  As always, the Kalahari Typing School for men is not \\"about\\" having Mma Ramotswe solve a tricky locked-room mystery.  It's much more about the interleaving of Western and African cultures.  For example, a detective agency replaces a combination of the village grapevine and village leadership.  In this installment and the previous three books, Mma Ramotswe's personal life and those of her friends gets more than equal time with the cases she solves.<br /><br />The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series is my favorite of the four series by McCall Smith that I have sampled.  His gentle tone and leisurely pace fit the setting perfectly.  I would recommend a new reader begin with the first book, as there is not a lot of explanation as to who all these characters are and how they got to where they are.  Not only that, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency sets the mood for the series perfectly.<br /><br />If you are not a fan of crime stories, don't let that put you off.  This is a charming fiction set in another culture with an unforgettable main character.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|What impresses me is that the film is authetic in many important ways.  Besides the movie's a biopic, the costumes were acquired but not made, and the movie was filmed at the actual Lake District in England (thanks to Beatrix Potter herself).  Renee Zellweger and the rest of the cast made this romantic film so charming and heart-felt along with a great deal of enthusiasum.  Great people like Potter always deserve a film or documentary dedicated to them, and I think this movie did a wonderful job and lived up to its standard.

B0000524CY|5.0|There's few horror films that you can return to, and still find something genuinely frightening each time. One exception, is 1973's \\"The Exorcist\\", based on the best selling novel by William Peter Blatty (who directed and wrote \\"The Exorcist III based on his novel \\"Legion,\\" which represents the true sequel to the original novel). In this film, William Friedkin directs with a terse, methodical approach, which lends the film an aura of authenticity, despite its outlandish theme. But as fans of the novel and film know well, Blatty's novel is based on one of the few documented cases of demonic possession, which occurred in Georgetown in the 1940's.<br /><br />Okay, so what makes this movie so frightening to most. Friedkin provides a nice introduction to the film in the 1998 DVD release, which is not included on \\"The version you've never seen.\\" In that introduction, Friedkin accurately explains that people take from \\"The Exorcist\\" what they choose. If you see the world as a dark and evil place, Friedkin notes, then you will focus on those elements, but if you believe that a force of goodness exists to combat the evils of this world, then you will take what the filmmakers wanted you to leave with--a feeling of hope, and faith that goodness can prevail against evil, no matter how sinister in nature.<br /><br />Most of those reading this review may have some notion about the focus of this film. In a nutshell, a young girl (Linda Blair) is possessed by an ancient demon (who claims to be the devil), and two priests (one faltering in his faith, and the other old and feeble), join forces to compell the spirit to leave the child's body. The acting is supurb by all those involved. Jason Miller, Max Von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, and Lee J Cobb are so convincing, that every word they utter rings true. Honestly, there's not a bad performance in this entire cast, and the dialogue is simply fantastic. Freidkin is a skilled director, and the film has a documentary-like feel to it; and despite having Catholic priests (both real and acted) in the cast, the film is never didatic or panders to those who are ignorant and waiting for a cheap thrill.<br /><br />\\"The Exorcist\\" remains the greastest horror movie of all time because it wasn't made for teenagers--like so many are today. This is a thinking person's movie. It's creepy in every aspect, but the most frightening scenes are those where you least expect it. For example, the sequence of hospital tests on the young girl are disturbing beyond anything that the demon might do. This film takes itself seriously, and we are drawn into the horror because everyone is convinced that this is real--this could really happen (and it supposedly did).<br /><br />The words, \\"Could you help a poor Altat boy, father\\" are uttered by a homeless man in the subway. Father Karras (Jason Miller) encounters the man, and then turns his back on him, thereby turning his back on the impoverished humanity this homeless man is meant symbolize. Later, the demon utters these very same words to Karras...echoing the homeless man's words precisely. How did the demon know? Surely, the demon has the ability to see beyond the confines of Regans bedroom. Ah, it's the unanswered questions such as these that makes this film so intriguing. Watch it once, then watch it again...but always watch it after dark with the lights turned low. The sound is just as masterful as every other aspect of the film. This film is for adults only, of course, and I think even older teenagers aren't mature enough to understand the more subtle elements of horror here. Times have changed, and horror films have become increasingly violent and gory, but this wonderful film from 1973 has never been duplicated in the sheer amount of terror it delivers. I suspect that it will continue to haunt the minds of its viewers for years to come.having Catholic priests (both real and acted) in the cast, the film is never didatic or panders to those who are ignorant and waiting for a cheap thrill.    \\"The Exorcist\\" remains the greastest horror movie of all time because it wasn't made for teenagers--like so many are today.

This film takes itself seriously, and we are drawn into the horror because everyone is convinced that this is real--this could really happen (and it supposedly did).    The words, \\"Could you help a poor Altat boy, father\\" are uttered by a homeless man in the subway. Father Karras (Jason Miller) encounters the man, and then turns his back on him, thereby turning his back on the impoverished humanity this homeless man is meant symbolize. Later, the demon utters these very same words to Karras...echoing the homeless man's words precisely. How did the demon know? Surely, the demon has the ability to see beyond the confines of Regans bedroom. Ah, it's the unanswered questions such as these that makes this film so intriguing. Watch it once, then watch it again...but always watch it after dark with the lights turned low. The sound is just as masterful as every other aspect of the film. This film is for adults only, of course, and I think even older teenagers aren't mature enough to understand the more subtle elements of horror here. Times have changed, and horror films have become increasingly violent and gory, but this wonderful film from 1973 has never been duplicated in the sheer amount of terror it delivers. I suspect that it will continue to haunt the minds of its viewers for years to come.
B000002UYZ|4.0|I have to say The Beatles were the Hub of my music experience. This \\"Best of\\" offering for The mega band will have someone's choice of the greatest and/or most significant to them, leaving out many of the ones I would have chosen.<br />Beatles 1962 - 1966 has been around for decades and is still a good starter collection of their earlier sound.<br />This collection would, in a perfect world, be at least a 4 CD set. If you grew up with the \\"Fab Four\\" you understand. A mega set with all their albums is desired. This set does, however, provide the desired sounds and is convenient to rifle through their albums of those years.<br />Back then, we listened to every single cut on those albums and didn't start skipping songs untill the wierd eastern sounding stuff and then the cuts that obviously came from a drug infected mind about 1967 to their end as a group in 1970.<br />The album photo tells the story. They started out as clean cut guys in suits, rocking the house down with jams like we had never heard the likes of before. They were the vanguard of the \\"British Invasion\\" and music has never been the same. We did love them like no others.<br />Caution! You, as a result of getting this collection \\"In your life\\", may require \\"Meet the Beatles\\", \\"The Beatles Second album\\", \\"Something New, Something New\\", \\"The Early Beatles\\", \\"Hard Day's Night\\" (And get the movie!), Beatles '65\\", \\"Beatles VI\\" (We called it Beatles '66), \\"The Beatles Yesterday and Today\\",\\"Help\\" (And get the movie), \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\". You have been warned.
B000FA57RQ|3.0|If you speak English you probably can and you probably WILL use it to describe this film as it really dragged after the first half and the only redeeming qualities it has are the superb music numbers. The biggest problem is that it does not have an option to see the music numbers on their own and even then it does not have all the performances from the original concert.  The message of the film could have been put forth in 25 minutes...
B000VI70WM|4.0|It's been a long and strange trip since Duran Duran's last major commercial success, 1993's \\"Wedding Album\\". Indeed, in the 4 albums the band had released since then, things went from headscratching (the all-covers \\"Thank You\\" album), to the plain terrible (the \\"Medazzaland\\" album) etc. Following the very disappointing \\"Astronaut\\" album in 2004, the guys decided to call in the big guns, in the latest (desparate?) attempt to regain commercial credibility.<br /><br />On \\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" (12 tracks, 41 min.), the now foursome (Andy Taylor having left the band) call in the help of Timbaland and Justin Timberlake for 4 tracks, and not surprisingly those tracks stand out and simply sound better than anything else on the album. \\"Nite-Runner\\" is as heavy a track as DD has ever recorded. \\"Falling Down\\" (1st single) feels like it's an outtake from Justin Timberlake's most recent album, not that it matters as it sounds terrific. \\"Skin Divers\\" and \\"Zoom In\\" are equally good and have that instatnly recognizable Timbaland touch to them. The rest of the album is a mixed bag, however (the best remaining tracks being the title track and \\"Tempted\\"), and even though the album runs only 41 min., there still are a number of filler tracks (such as the instrumental \\"Tricked Out\\" and the closer \\"Last Man Standing\\") that should've been left out.<br /><br />\\"Red Carpet Massacre\\" is not a bad album, and it is easily Duran Duran's best album since the \\"Wedding Album\\". That said, the commercial success that the band so badly was seeking has not materialized, as the album fell quicky from the Billboard 200 chart, and the single went nowhere and hardly got any airplay (who knows what would have happened had it been marketed as \\"Duran Duran featuring Justin Timberlake\\"?). And what is the lesson from all this? That desparately seeking commercial success is no guarantee for success. A valiant effort that comes up short.
B0010X745K|5.0|I've always considered The Mist Stephen King's finest piece of work. A mini novel, or long short story, whichever way you think of it, the book was inspired after King was waiting in line with his son at a Supermarket, and the story idea came to him. He observed the attitude of the people waiting, and their moods. To King, everything is an inspiration..    The Mist brings to life your worst nightmares, which could not possibly happen..But what if it DID happen? When horror stories affect people in ordinary life, everyday situations, it makes them more believable and scary at the same time, because the audience can associate themselves in it, and imagine how they themselves might well react.     When David Drayton and his Son are trapped inside a supermarket during an unprecidented fog, it becomes evident terrible creatures are inside the fog, this phenomina unleashed after a terrible storm. Drayton has to decide if he and his son are at more danger inside the market from the other people there, increasingly under the influence of the eccentric Mrs. Carmody, or attempting to break out and face the creatures. The book offers no explanation, only inferences. The film takes on an ending of it's own, with the writers approval.     Horror of this magnitude is better left inside the mind, which is why I think the book will never be surpassed by the film. Also, the casting is strange in some ways, Mrs Carmody for example is much younger than described in the book, manager Ollie Weeks much older. Cantankerous next door neighbour Brent Norton, for some reason, is nothing like the character described by King.     It has not taken so many years to bring The Mist to film for no reason. It's so hard to do justice to a subject such as this. There will be moments of pure look away horror for the viewer, but it's my hope that the improvised ending will not leave too many dissatisfied. The ending, in a case like this, is something which can never be explained to any degreee of satisfaction, too many people will simply reject it. To offer a form of explanation at all may even be phoney.     Why on earth though, did they give the ending away by the picture on the DVD cover???

The record companies are selling fewer CD's, and they're alienating the few good customers they have left. I buy hundreds of CD's every year, but that will change if I keep getting screwed.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|As with everything I guess this is just a matter of taste.<br />Sky Blue Sky is to me a very solid album. Thats why I'm giving it 5 stars.<br />In this album you can hear a little of both worlds, their alter-country  and more trendy edgy modern sound. Beautiful songs like side with the seeds are just full of harmony  and beautifully conducted but with some spice, a great interlude!<br /><br />On and On and On is also a fabulous song, very dreamy is like the perfect soundtrack for a urban theme if you get me.<br /><br />My favorite song is Impossible Germany, it is about the fall of Hitler. This song is absolutely brilliant,  it covers perfectly the whole idea of a song and has a killer sleek guitar solo.<br /><br />One thing I guarantee you is that you wont be disappointed with his album.

B00005JL78|5.0|John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is chief of the Precrimes Unit in Washington, D.C. in the year 2053. The unit has abolished murder in their city with the aid of three \\"precogs\\" who can see the crimes before they happen. Police arrest the suspect based on the visions and the prisoner's are put into suspended animation immediately. The \\"trial\\" each receives is apparently limited to their appearance in the precog visions. Anderton believes in the system wholeheartedly and is proud of the results. Just after he learns of odd discrepancies in a few cases, however, the precogs have a vision that implicates him in the murder of a man he's never heard of. Anderton makes a run for it to try and prove his innocence. The rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride as he tries to escape from the police while uncovering the real villain.     Minority Report is a mixed bag of a movie. The action sequences are all exciting and Cruise conveys enough urgency that it goes a long way toward carrying the film. At the same time, the plot suffers from numerous holes and inconsistencies. For example, the precogs can only see a murder when the killer forms the intent. But Anderton's murder is predicted even though he knows nothing about the victim and certainly has no intention of killing him.     Overall, I enjoyed Minority Report. It's well produced and Cruise's energy and passion in the role help show once again why he's a major star. The story doesn't hold up very well to even casual analysis so you need to be prepared to just let that slide or skip the movie completely.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|Wow! This movie is too good for words!! Thoroughly interesting as an early attempt at science fiction. Cool effects considering CGI wasn't even dreamed up for another several decades. It is kind of long and some parts are boring, but overall, I will recommend this oldie to people who really like sci-fi and silent movies.
B001AQMBNC|5.0|Update:  I just purchased Starman, in Blu-ray; from Amazon.com.  I received it, on October 15, 2010.  It states on the back of the box; 2009.  Regarding Layout & Design.<br /><br />I am very happy to say, that MY copy...IS in Widescreen!  It has the narrow, black strips - on the Top & Bottom of the screen.  Fills the entire screen, from Left to Right.  Hence, this is Widescreen!  Correct?<br /><br />The Blu-ray Disc, of Starman...is Amazing!!  The Picture Quality, is Excellent...& the Sound Quality (Audio) is Excellent as well!!  IMO, \\"they\\"...finally -- HAVE gotten things right, with Starman!  This is one of my Favorite Movies, of all time.  A Classic Movie!!  And now, it looks, & sounds...better than ever.  A real treat, to see it like this!!<br /><br />I'm using a Sony Blu-ray player, & a Sony 32\\" LCD/HD \\"Flat Panel/Flat Screen\\" TV.<br />1080i; 16:9.<br /><br />My Previous Review:<br /><br />This is such an Excellent, Great Movie!!  I've always loved it.  Just bought it, yesterday.  I totally agree, regarding the following.  This movie, should be in Wide Screen Format.  Hope the \\"suits,\\" come to there senses...& release this Classic Movie, in the Wide Screen Format...it deserves.  I would buy it, anyway (& did)...in Full Screen Format.  It's still great to watch.  Rhetorical statement; it's most likely a \\"money thing.\\"  Greed...
B000YABYLA|5.0|This movie is awesome it is one of my new favorites!!!! I totally need to watch it a million more times. Ellen Page did a fantastic job!!!!
B0001WDAX6|2.0|I got this one because I didn't know about the latest 2disc DVD release with B/W and color remastered versions. I was interested in this release because the colorized version was the only remastered version I knew of.  Lighting in all the other B/W releases is NOTHING like the originals due to several decades of VAULT DECAY.   Remastering is required to see anything close to what the directors/editors originally produced 50 years ago.

0743289684|5.0|Genital mutilations in Somalia, routine beatings by her mother, an arranged marriage, her escape from oppression, her election to the Dutch parliament, and death threats form the backdrop of this amazing biography.<br /><br />Her writing is Hemmingwayesque in its terseness and attention to detail. The narrative is gripping. Ayaan Hirsi Ali tells a vivid, unforgettable story of her life as an ordinary Muslim female.  Other-worldly Somali tribal customs, racism in Saudi Arabia, religious bigotry in Kenya, and starvation and rape during a civil war are just some of the cruel jewels of this story.<br /><br />Her account illuminates Islam from the inside. In the process, Ms. Ali helps each of us appreciate anew the freedom that so many of us in the West \\"spit on,\\" as she said in a subsequent interview.<br /><br />Many Muslims have threatened to kill this brave sole for speaking out about the oppression of women in Islam and its oppression of free thought: she is currently under the protection of professional security services.<br /><br />Her remarkable courage is a monument to what feminism must aspire to.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I guess nobody else saw the film in a theater?  It was produced grainy which gives it more the feel of the original graphic novel.  Great picture and surround sound in blu-ray!
B000VDDDY6|5.0|An excellent redux of special effects and sounds of \\"The Original Star Trek\\" series so it can match up the the other Star Trek series, entitled: ENTERPRISE. But Paramount should have considered in the cleaning up the prints (digitally)  and make the colours more vibrate, just like the 007 producers did with the James Bond films. But it is a great purchase.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The primary, and best, addition in this 4th edition of Settlers is a very nice interlocking border which is placed around the game tiles.  This replaces the individual hex tiles of previous editions.  No longer will your tiles/pieces scatter/split apart when someone accidentally bumps the playing surface!  One side of the border has the ports \\"built in\\" but you still get a bit of randomness when assembling the pieces.  The flip side of the border is blank \\"sea\\" on which you can put the included port tokens for a truly random placement.<br /><br />The updated graphics are nice and colorful but take a bit of getting use to if you regularly play with an older edition.<br /><br />The box has a vacu-formed type insert designed to hold all the pieces and keep everything neat.<br /><br />All-in-all a nice upgrade to the 3rd edition.<br /><br />It's a simple sounding premise: You gather resources in order to build roads and settlements to earn points.<br /><br />However, there is a wonderful randomness which lends complexity to the game as the layout of the game board tiles differs with each play right down to the number on the dice needed to harvest a resource from a given tile.  This makes *every* game unique.  Strategy comes into play as you must determine the best location for your settlements and roads to get maximum value/points.<br /><br />If you've never played Settlers, find someone who has a copy and give it a try.  If no one you know owns a copy, go to your local comic shop.  Odds are someone there will have a copy readily available and delight in teaching the game to a new player!  It's easy to learn, difficult to master, and quick to play with a typical game lasting only an hour or less.<br /><br />This is one of the truly classic games and belongs on the shelf of anyone who enjoys board gaming.

Not much info on accessories for \\"system\\" cameras, however has listings for major stuff.  Very good index.  This book is the best there is out there for camera collectors.  And a very good value to boot.
B000XA5K48|4.0|Whacky, unlikely plot, but I think it's fitting for the thrill ride you go on. Clive Owen is stupendous, Paul Giamatti is just terrific. This film has some of the best gun play scenes ever. If you love the far-fetched \\"shoot 'em up\\" then well...that is the name of the film. I'll never look at carrots the same again, I had no idea they were \\"that\\" good for you. If you like War with Statham and Li you'll get a kick out of this one. A little twist at the end is good. The closing scene is sort of pointless, but fun nonetheless. No complaints about the DVD production.   The only complaint I found, amazingly, is the minor anti-gun thing. While it's part of the story, the \\"good\\" guy, if there is one, seems to favor gun control, which doesn't make much sense, since guns save his life at every turn.
B000XA5K48|4.0|This movie is so incredibly over-the-top I can't believe anyone would take it seriously, even for a moment.  The closest comparison I can offer up is Sin City, without the substance.      Shoot 'Em Up was fun from start to finish and one of my favorite actors- Paul Giamatti- gets to act really, really silly.    Also, carrots.
B000XA5K48|1.0|Before beginning I must admit that I found myself rooting for the stars of this movie and thats why I finished it but I must also say that of all the movies I have seen I would put this in the lower 5. I mean lets see- this guy kills people, slides all over the place, and rings down a rope all while holding a baby. He catches things on the highway while driving a car, he kills people plenty of people while parachuting. He has s-x, holds the girl to his body and apparently cu-s while assasinating more people. He kills people with carrots! He flies out of the front of a car and breaks the window of the car behind him landing straight into th van and kills more people- and the killing continues- from the first to the very last scene. Also, the plot left me slightly confused. Blah!
0060005424|4.0|Good book.  For some reason, not quite as haunting as Sabriel, but more complex.  Sabriel was more of a stand-alone story.  This second novel in the series and the third novel Abhorsen run straight together like one big book. Lirael is a much more conflicted character than Sabriel was and the early chapters with her growing up among the Clayr and her work in the library are fascinating.  Prince Sammeth is also much more conflicted than was Touchstone in the first book.  Good character development.  The Disreputable Dog got on my nerves initially but then grew on me since her \\"dogness\\" was very real and detailed.
B00004XQJX|5.0|My reference for this piece is Daniel Barenboim's, but I haven't listened to it in years because the disc got scratched to the point that it was unlistenable. So for the most part I came to my conclusions about this recording only from listening to it while I was working on the piece myself. I may never be able to play it as well as Pollini, but I can dream, right?    Nobody has been happier than me to experience a Maurizio Pollini who knows how to be gentle and humane. Some of his recordings from the '80s and early '90s, like the Chopin Fantaisie in F minor, sound like someone who hates the piano and wants to strangle it to death. His recent Schumann and Beethoven recordings are the product of a very different and more mature musician, one who has the same ability to pierce and project structure but doesn't feel the need to make everything loud and fast into a test of whether a listener's eardrums can explode from too much mental intensity.    Actually, he really seems to be enjoying himself now, and it shows amply throughout this disc of the Diabelli Variations. This work attracts the best and the brightest of each generation, but it's rare to sound someone who actually sounds like they were having fun in the recording studio. It's quite infectious, and for me, that feeling of good cheer is the best reason to recommend this CD. Here we have someone who has known and performed the piece for decades, endured all the hardships, and still simply gets a kick out of doing it.    Some things I didn't like: VI is very muddy, especially the left hand. In VII Pollini's dynamic choices are strange and make it sound weak and watery. The timing in XIII is off and the comedy is lost. XXIX sounds mechanical.    Some things I did like: the slightly ponderous, upright feel of III is just right. IV is beautiful and blossoms perfectly. VIII is clear and elegant. X is a quicksilver delight. The alarm bells in XVI are perfectly hideous. XXXI, the Largo, is simply perfect, and the concluding variation is the ideal capstone. After all of the jeering and hissing at Diabelli's expense, Beethoven takes us back to an older time with a simple, graceful menuetto. Was it a reaction to the waltz trend which was sweeping Europe at an alarming rate and rocketing inconsequential composers to fame? Or was this his way of coming to peaceful terms with what was, at heart, a fairly innocuous and fun little ditty? Pollini doesn't answer that question, but his reading is marvelous food for thought.
0345298349|5.0|An intricate and profoundly sad murder mystery that rises above genre conventions to be a literate story and great character study as well as a fascinatingly detailed look at the repressive Brezhnev years in the Soviet Union.<br /><br />Arkady Renko is a thirtyish, down-trodden investigator who is burdened with a triple-homicide that no one seems to want him to solve:  three murder victims, missing their faces and fingerprints, are dumped in the middle of the popular Gorky Park in Moscow.  Renko, while enduring the dissolution of his marriage to a selfish woman, tries to prove an international link so that the KGB will take the case off his hands.<br /><br />By the time he actually can prove this, he wants to solve the case and has fallen in love with mysterious Irina, a dissident who seems implicated somehow.  Unforgettable.
B000R34V50|5.0|I bought this on a whim, hadn't seen the movie and didn't have high-hopes that I'd like it.  After watching it though I have to change my tone, the movie is beautiful--the big downside is that I really didn't follow what was going on because I was too busy sucking in the eye candy every moment.    It looks awesome in hi-def, and will definately be my \\"this is blu-ray\\" movie of choice to show off to friends.    Speaking of the movie itself (not the graphics) the parts that I did catch made me more than happy.  They didn't slaughter the turtle characters, or any of the other main players.  I'll have to watch it at least a couple more times so I can actually pay attention, but I loved what I've seen so far.
0060528737|4.0|Good direct continuation from the second book (Lirael) in the series.  We go all the way through the Precincts and Gates of the land of the dead this time.  Nice resolution of who the Disreputable Dog and Mogget really are.  If I have any complaints, I think it's that the final conflict is handled with a bit too much ease by our young and inexperienced heroine in the Ninth Precinct.  Still, a satisfying book.

0060763280|5.0|This book is just what I was looking for. It is a perfect blend of practical advice on how to manage your money, as well as some good metaphysical concepts about the nature of money. I have already recommended it to 6 other family/friends members, and have given away a few copies as well. I immediately was able to recognize my \\"Money Blueprint\\" as the author calls it, and was given information in this book as to how to go about changing it to a more empowering one. I am on my second reading, and plan to take the authors advice of reading it once a month for a year, untill the concepts sink deeply n my subconcious mind! I highly recommend it!
B000YABYLA|5.0|...and this is one of those films. It is both hilarious and touching. It is also one of the most realistic films about teenage life that I have ever seen. Ellen Page is amazing. I loved her in \\"Hard Candy\\" - her performance, not her character - and I loved her in this film as well. She IS Juno, and you care for this young lady and her ordeal. Ellen Page is an amazing actress, and I cannot wait to see her future films. The rest of the cast is also excellent. One thing that must be mentioned here is the writing. It is so funny and so honest, and all I have to say is that screenwriter, Diablo Cody, is a genius when it comes to words. Some people have said that this film is derivative of Wes Anderson's work, but I totally disagree. It is Jason Reitman's best film so far, and I liked this one better than \\"Thank You For Smoking\\". The music is also very quirky, and I liked it a lot...    Please, do not miss the chance to see this one in the theatre! You will laugh your head off, and you will come out of it deeply moved. I loved this film!    SEE IT!
B000M3PKU0|1.0|This dvd is a bootleg that ain't worth the powder to blow it to Hades.  The makers of the DVD do not respect copyright laws and from the looks of the dvd they don't care about quality either. It's a dvd-r, by the way, and who want's to pay $25 for a copy?  I am surprised AMAZON can't seem to get its act together in policing its own site.
0525950079|5.0|Ken Follett's World Without End was one of the most satisfying reads in quite some time. Follett's writing really transports you to the time of the novel - mid 1300's - and you feel as though you are there. I loved Pillars of the Earth and I think I may like this book as much. While it's a sequel, it does not require having read its predecessor and in fact you could read them out of order and enjoy them both just as well.
0307276902|4.0|This book although hounded by accusations of twisted facts and fruad was and is an amazing story.  Fact or fiction this book shed a light on me as to what addiction is like.      The writing style took a little while to get used to but after a chapter or so I was fluidly reading and cringing, hoping and praying for this lost soul.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I don't think anyone would debate that Radiohead has been on the cutting edge since 1995, but I don't think anyone was expecting this album's unconventional method of release. I'm talking about is the famous \\"name-your-price\\" download sales method they chose. That is cutting-edge. This way, the record companies can't screw us over. I was disappointed that they stopped the online download in mid-December, but hey. You can't have it all. Anyway, the music itself also received a lot of critical acclaim, and I see why - as a first, it's their most accessible, energetic effort since The Bends, and it's a fantastic set of songs too. My favorite song is \\"Reckoner\\". Thom Yorke's vocals are quirky, haunting, \\"sixth-instrument\\" type, the harmonies are gorgeous; the beats are complex and danceable; and I love the orchestrated section. Another highlight is the atmospheric \\"Nude\\", a piano-based ballad which serves as a sequel-in-spirit to \\"Pyramid Song\\"; Phil Selway stands out on the energetic \\"15 Step\\"; \\"Weird Fish/Arpeggi\\" delivers beautiful guitar parts; the love song \\"House of Cards\\" has mellow Stax-Volt riffs and vocals that channel Al Green - it's almost soul music, if you exclude that warm, comforting wall of orchestral effects; the quiet folk-rocker \\"Jigsaw Falling into Place\\" books along pleasantly, adding just a dash of country; \\"Videotape\\" actually has a hopeful, minimalist melody. I'm not so sure about a couple songs - \\"Bodysnatchers\\" is too fast-paced to attain the eeriness the synthesizers try to convey, and I don't like how those synthesizers clash so badly with the heavy guitars; \\"Faust ARP\\", while too brief and quiet to really get on my nerves, does have cloyingly repetitive lyrics. And while \\"All I Need\\" starts off nice enough, I'm not a very big fan of the last two minutes, when all these layers of noise are coming at you. But it's got Radiohead successfully branching into previously unexplored territory, and the melodies, lyrics, and arrangements are brilliant as they always are, so my small complaints really are meaningless. Besides, I even like parts of \\"Bodysnatchers\\", before they those synthesizer parts enter. In Rainbows is excellent even for Radiohead, a group with high standards.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie from beginning to end since I was 4 or 5, so I didn't remember it too well. When I finally got the DVD for Christmas and watched it, I loved every minute of it. Jungle Book has lost none of its charm over the past 40 years. From the very beginning, when we see Bagheera rescuing the abandoned \\"man-cub,\\" Mowgli and entrusting him to the wolf pack, to Mowgli's journey through the jungle to the man village, it's a pure delight. Shere Khan, who hates man, has returned to the jungle to find young  Mowgli and kill him. The wolf pack hears about this and decides it's too dangerous to keep him around any longer, and have Bagheera escort him to the man village to safety. Of course, Mowgli does not want to leave the jungle, and tries to get away from Bagheera. He meets Baloo the bear, Kaa the python, and the scat-singing King Louie (voiced by the legendary Louie Prima). This can more than hold its own against modern classics such as \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" \\"Aladdin,\\" and \\"Lion King.\\" Highly recommended for kids of all ages!
B00110WFYW|5.0|This story picks up where \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\", left off. The fellowship apparently divided in its direction and even thought the immediate purposes diverge and converge the urgency of getting the ring to Mordor is ever present. We are lucky in the fact that J. R. R. Tolkien will completely follow each participant's path from beginning to end. All the wars are covered in detail and the progress of the ring bearer is chronicled. New creatures and old vermin reveal themselves.<br /><br />As with the Ramayana, we find that every creature has his/her function and that there is no black and white in this purpose. Frodo alludes to this when he thinks of Gandalf, Aragorn, and Gollum. Even Gandalf tells not to hurt Gollum as he may play a larger role in the story that one could imagine.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]]

B000LXHK2C|2.0|I was soooo embarassed watching this movie, embarrassed for Crowe who was so noble and manly in Gladiator.    I guess Ridley Scott and Crowe thought it would be a hoot to foray into a foreign territory for the two of them: comedy. Best that these two stick to what they do best and that's high drama and adventure. It's much easier for a comedian to venture into drama than a dramatic actor to try comedy.  Comedy timing can't be taught and Crowe does not have IT.    I lasted the first 20 minute then got completely exhausted watching the machine gun editing and run-around- the- actor in circles camera work at Crowe's character's finance office.    Then they actually put Crowe into a Mr. Bean-like car and sent him into the countryside to see the glorious winery. That was the only reason I stuck with pretty much the whole movie, although the middle sagged and I went to another channel for a while. It was hard to see the estate as Scott started filming the place like a TV commercial: rapid editings that continued while 2 characters would stand and talk. My eyes were kept so busy they got very tired.    First there is the \\"cute meet\\" where Crowe runs a pretty, but boring, Italian or French girl off the road. Then Crowe falls into an empty swimming pool and oh, my, it was embarrassing watching him try to be Peter Sellers or Mr. Bean trying to get out of the pool. Crowe has not the timing or comedic physical talents to carry off this cliche' scene.    This one is a snoozer and I pray that Scott and Crowe NEVER again attempt comedy!

B00003CX9E|4.0|It is very difficult to write a review for a film like \\"Citizen Kane\\", that is universally accepted as being one of the greatest movies of all time. It seems unnecessary to write another review proclaiming its brilliance, while to say anything else seems like sacrilige. The only way I think that this can be done is by considering each aspect of the film one at a time.    \\"Citizen Kane\\" is the story of multi-millionaire Charles Foster Kane, told by those who knew him, to a journalist, after his death. It is said to be based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who attempted, unsuccessfully, to have the film suppressed upon its release.    Technically, \\"Citizen Kane\\" is a brilliant film. From a historical point of view, this film revolutionized film making. In \\"Citizen Kane\\", Orson Welles introduced a number of cinematic techniques that had previously never been used in American movies. Prior to \\"Citizen Kane\\", movies were just seen as little more than filmed stage plays. Orson Welles changed that and because of him film became an artistic medium in its own right. Although, Welles's use of these techniques seems a little clumsy by modern standards, considering that he didn't have decades of movies to refer to, what he did was incredible.     The acting in \\"Citizen Kane\\" is uneven in quality. Orson Welles (who received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this film) is excellent as Kane, as is Joseph Cotten as Kane's best friend. The film is let down, however, by its supporting actors, in particular Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife. Nevertheless, it is pointed out at the end of the film that the majority of the actors in this film had never appeared in movies before, so to a certain extent, the poor acting can be overlooked. (As an aside, watch out for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance by Alan Ladd as a journalist in the final scene of the film).    What lets down \\"Citizen Kane\\" the most is its script. From the vantage point of the 21st century, \\"Citizen Kane\\"'s Oscar winning script seems slow-moving and is the victim of poor character development. The news reel scene at the start of the film goes on for too long, as does the second half of the film, about Kane's personal life. I would have preferred to see more of his newspaper career. Further, the characters of both of Kane's wives are underdeveloped.    Overall, I do not think \\"Citizen Kane\\" deserves to be called the \\"best\\" film of all time. There are other better films out there, even films made at about the same time, for example \\"Casablanca\\", which was made the following year. Nevertheless, I will agree that it is one of the most influential movies of all time, and for that it deserves to be seen.

0784010188|5.0|Pretty much from the word go it's like a roller coaster ride.<br />You go up & down and left to right, by the end of the ride your a<br />little sore, but you always want to ride again.<br />This is one of the best action movies of it's time, with all the<br />special effects and this time you have 2 Terminators.<br />One to protect and one to kill John Connors and anyone that gets in<br />their way.<br />This was no doubt one of the best movies in the 90's.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000FS9FC6|1.0|This film has been compared to the work of George Orwell..I really doubt that Mr Eric Blair would feel honoured by the comparison. In fact I believe he might be turning in his grave right now, that this juvenile, nasty trash might be promoted in his name.<br /><br />As a British viewer, this film really jarred with me. Ok, there are lots of explosions, lots of violence, lots of cool allusions to the war on terror, lots of smart references to fuddy duddy old white people and their prejudices and consequently lots of fuddy duddy old white people being brutally killed by our hero. Hey, we even have a dirty old catholic priest character asking if Natalie Portman in kneesocks and pigtails 'is too old', ignoring of course that 99% of the Catholic abuse victims have been boys.  But then we don't want to confuse our distinctions between the 100% evil subhuman paedophiles and the 100% good homosexuals do we? Life should be simple, like a comic book. Or, indeed, like an american Democratic outlook on the world.<br />But the most obviously jarring element is the fact that the film is set in London, with a facist, right wing government, and yet the film is a crude portrayal I assume, of 'where Dubya is taking us'. It might be difficult for young American Democratic voters to comprehend, but the UK is being led into a nightmare Orwellian state not by a rightwing party, but by a leftwing party, until recently led by Tony Blair.  It was he who, together with Bush, led the invasion of Iraq. It is his government that has made it illegal to even criticise Islam or homosexuality, that is introducing ID cards, that has installed security cameras in nearly every street in the country and that has led to dumbed down, brutal, anamalistic society where half a million of the native populaton flee abroad nearly every year.<br />But this wouldn't suprise George Orwell, who wrote Animal Farm AND 1984 based on his experience of and consequent disgust of the left's hypocricy, simple-mindedness and refusal to tolerate opposition or dissension.tolerate opposition or dissension.

B000OPOAM0|4.0|T3, was the first Terminator movie I saw, and I greatly enjoyed it. When I heard the first two were better, I bought both without watching them and I was satisfied. Though I will admit I'm a very tiny bit underwhelmed.     though it was a good film, I don't believe it had the bang that I expected the movie to have due to it's large amounts of praise. It had a good amount of Arny action and shooting in there, lot's of running and what not, but it didn't contain the loud bang that an action film shuld have. In fact, it was styled a bit more like a horror film, just without the amount of scares. The acting was first-rate, as was the story and script, it's just not an action flick.     If you've been looking around for a good, dark, almost slasher-like film, then look no further, this is it.    8/10 good, compelling and thought provoking (though not in a peaceful way) a good film that's sets it's own standards.     Also, about the dvd cover. People, it says Lenticular COVER Edition, if you were looking for something more with the dvd itself, then you should have investigated more then look at the title which says COVER in it and think it contains more.
1897299214|5.0|I read this book in a couple of nights and then passed onto my sister and my mum. We all thoroughly appreciated the journey in pictures speaking more than a thousand words.

B00008PC2O|4.0|As far as action movies go T2:JD is IT, it's got explosions, shooting, and 'Ahnold shwarshnaygah'! (pun intended, yes I spelled his name wrong on purpose!) Unlike other action movies, T2 includes charracter development, character depth, intricate plot and (suprisingly) a moral statement.     The acting is by far the best thing in the film, every role is played to the point that you have to surrender to the movie's will that these are not just characters, these people are 'REALITY' *. The visual effects are another great for this film, the effects are astounding, well not nowadays, but for back then, these were beyond just a 'breakthrough'.    though this movie is not without it's flaws.......    (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)    At the climax, the movie succumbs to \\"stupid bad guy, and plot devices\\", here, let me explain: The entire movie, the bad guy has been running himself to death to kill John Connor, he can transform his arms and fingers into huge blades, which can apparently expand a decent length. He can also run at superhuman speeds, he can also imitate peoples body and voice to trick people into traps. Now, at the end of the film, he has connor within 30 feet of him, and all he does is walk 'SLOWLY' toward him (I'm guessing this was for suspense, but the effect was stupid). And of course, due to the Terminator's sluggishness, he easily runs away, while his mom stays behind for reasons I can't fathom (she had ages to get away herself).     Once the Terminator reaches Johns mom, he turns his finger into a long blade and impales her through the shoulder, he tells her to call for John, she resists, this sequence goes on for a minute, this entire time, I'm saying to myself, \\"WHY DON'T YOU JUST KILL HER, TRANSFORM INTO HER AND CALL FOR JOHN!!!!\\", of course he does this later, but of course, then somebody comes to save John and bla bla bla.      (SPOILERS END)      Another thing that might turn off some veiwers is that you can't really relate to anybdy in this movie. One person's bad boy middle-school kid with rotten foster parents who he's stuck with(some may be able to relate to this, but most probably won't be watching this movie), one's a woman who's trapped in a mental hospital, one's a scientist on the verge of a world-changing discovery and one is a.. uh, robot.    Well, there you have it, a rough and tough action film with a kind of weak climax, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the story.     8.5/10  (probably would have been 9/10 if it weren't for that ending).    * The exception of this would have been the role of Edward Furlong, though this is somewhat excusable due to him being a child actor, his character is a bit less than beleiveable.

0060898739|4.0|was saddened to hear last year of the death of Kurt Vonnegut. He was an author with cynical wit and satiric voice. From his short stories to his novels, his rye wit gave readers and listeners a humor as well as an interest yarn.<br /><br />In this audio version, veteran audio narrator Tony Roberts is taken to task with all the audio skills he has with this tale of earth's fate . . . and he succeeds very well. Roberts commands this audio with an easy-going style. Most narrators would take a hard edge and be very  blunt in their narrative, not Roberts. This is one reason this audio novel intrigues on many levels<br /><br />After the production is finished, there is a small piece of Vonnegut himself discussing his work.

6305841861|5.0|No horror collection is complete without Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II, honestly.  The Evil Dead was a solid effort for its day and age but seems like treaded territory by today's standards (excluding the \\"Tree Rape\\" scene, something only tried again in the theatrical remake \\"George of the Jungle\\").  Evil Dead II, however, remains almost timeless with its over-the-top gore and sadistically savage humor.  On the A-List of B-Movies, this film remains a cult favorite with star Bruce Campbell manning the show in one of his most memorable performances to date (see \\"Army of Darkness\\" for more memorableness and see \\"Bubba Ho-Tep\\" to make you urn for an \\"Evil Dead IV\\" with an older Ash).  This DVD edition is no slack on bonus features with hilarious commentaries by the filmmakers and Bruce Campbell himself.  You'll see this one on Best Of lists forever and ever.  So do yourself a huge favor and just get it.

B000002IH5|4.0|\\"The Dock of the Bay\\" sadly became Otis Redding's last album, and it's a bit of a haphazard collection as well, gathering various singles and B-sides and including tracks recorded as far back as 1965.     Perhaps surprisingly, it's also one of his best albums. The famous title track from 1968 sticks out stylistically; there is really nothing here quite like it.   The rest of the album is more traditional soul, spanning emotional ballads like \\"I Love You More Than Words Can Say\\" and the gospel-like \\"The Glory Of Love\\", swaggering soul stompers like \\"I'm Coming Home To See About You\\" and \\"Let Me Come On Home\\", and dance-friendly R&B like \\"The Huckle-Buck\\" and \\"Tramp\\", the classic duet with Carla Thomas.    Even the lesser-known songs are good, or even great. The arrangements are excellent, relatively sparse but fittingly muscular, utilizing the small horn section to great effect. This is one classic soul record, and one of the ver ybest places to experience the great Otis Redding. It's sad that it came out under such circumstances.

0156907399|5.0|Published in 1927, \\"To the Lighthouse\\" is Virginia Woolf's elegy for her parents--her attempt to describe and understand them through the prism of fiction. Two years earlier, Woolf had written in her diary that the book would be \\"fairly short\\" (it is) and that it would have \\"father's character done complete in it; & mother's; & St. Ives [the family summer home]; & childhood.\\" It's impossible to overestimate the influence of Woolf's parents on the development of this book; a year after the book was published, she acknowledged that she \\"was obsessed by them both, unhealthily; & writing of them was a necessary act.\\" As Hermione Lee put it in her biography, the novel is set in a \\"haunted house.\\"<br /><br />The remarkable empathy (and, to some extent, sympathy) for the novel's characters is testimony to Woolf's success: in powerful stream-of-consciousness passages told from ever-shifting perspectives, she re-creates from her own biography three entirely believable protagonists. Woolf's mother becomes Mrs. Ramsay, whose domain is largely confined to her home, her children, and her guests; like Clarissa Dalloway planning a party in Woolf's previous novel, Mrs. Ramsay sees the highlight of her day as carrying off a successful dinner for her family and guests--\\"she wished the dinner to be particularly nice.\\" Her husband, a philosopher, remains aloof from his family and their social sphere; his abrasiveness is a source of occasional annoyance to Mrs. Ramsay, and his own obsession is nothing so fleeting as a dinner party but rather the legacy that will be left by his life's work.<br /><br />Lily Briscoe, a young painter who is one of the guests, observes the family dynamics and critically regards the relationship between Mrs. Ramsay and her husband: \\"What was this mania of hers for marriage?\\" Lily also serves as a fictional alter-ego for Virginia Woolf herself. While working on a painting of Mrs. Ramsay reading to her son, Lily's lack of confidence is exacerbated by the opinion of another houseguest: \\"Women can't paint, women can't write\\"--a declaration linking Lily's timidity as a painter with Virginia's own qualms about the novel (she was anxious that it would be criticized as \\"sentimental\\"). Worrying unduly about what others think is inhibiting their talents.<br /><br />It's become obligatory to mention the supposed lack of plot in this book--but that old saw ignores the transformation of the novel's characters and their pursuit for meaningfulness. Mr. Ramsay wants respect; Mrs. Ramsay wants to be happy in her marriage; their son James wants the approval of his father; Lily wants to be an artist--but all are thwarted in their search for happiness. One houseguest muses, \\"What does one live for?\\" Similarly, Mrs. Ramsay reflects as dinner starts, \\"What have I done with my life?\\" And Lily wonders while she works on her painting: \\"What is the meaning of life? That was all--a simple question; one that tended to close in on one with years.\\"<br /><br />The novel's \\"action,\\" then, is the quest to find the ever-elusive \\"meaning of life\\": both within a single day (during the first half of the novel) and then ten years later, after the first World War, when what remains of the shattered family returns to the summer home and finally makes a long-postponed boat-trip to the lighthouse. Not everyone finds what they are looking for, but at last Lily Briscoe, who remains behind at the cottage, understands that approval and contentment and artistic talent had been there all along--within herself.

0810993139|4.0|I was introduced to this book by a co-worker of mine who was reading it with his nephew. They were both laughing out loud and were quick to recommend the book to me as a potential Christmas present for my prolific-reader daughter, who at 11 years of age is part of the target demographic for this book. Turns out that she was already familiar with the story, as it is adapted from a comic strip on Funbrain.com. Fact is, you can peruse the entire text of this book on Funbrain, although there are some differences between the online version and the print version. She was excited to get the book, though, and read it in one sitting. She giggled and chortled so much that I couldn't resist giving it a go, and I'm glad that I did.<br /><br />The main hero is a likeable, if clueless, goofball. He meanders his way through many a banal adventure, usually with his best friend at his side. Our hero and his bud tread the dangerous waters of unfortunate class seating charts, Halloween mishaps, Christmas disappointments, the soul-consuming terror of the school play, and many other familiar comic situations endemic to middle-class suburbia. The characters in this book pretty much act and react like real kids, and I think that the author has a pretty good idea of what it's like to be 11 or 12 years old again, on the cusp of adolescence but still very much caught up with childish emotions and motivations.<br /><br />It's not deep literature, it's not cutting-edge social commentary, it's not supposed to be a completely accurate reflection of middle-school life...but it IS pretty darn funny. My daughter was laughing and enjoying it, and I know that I did as well. I heartily recommend it, and we're looking forward to the next installment. I'd suggest going to Funbrain to check it out, then grab the print version if you like what you see. It's good to have the portability of a book, and it's well worth the ten-spot, IMO.
0061020680|5.0|Ah, the Disk World series.  I have to admit that it's been years since I've read any from Mr. Pratchett's Disk World.  My motivator for reading Mort was watching Hogfather on TV and I became fascinated watching Death.  To scratch my itch, I decided to pick up one of Mr. Pratchett's books where the main character was Death.  That being said...  Mort tells when a young man is being forced from home and looking for a job; and Death take him as an apprentice.  What could possibly happen?!?<br /><br />This book is great one if you enjoy a different look at our world (as with everything on the Disk World there's a little satire, a little punning, and a little Pratchett).  The concept of Death taking an apprentice and seeing what the apprentice can do is an interesting concept.  Taking it further is seeing what Death does when he has time off (Death going about with people...).  For me this was a five star book.  I love the twists in the story.  Watching Mort learning Death's ropes (or is that scythe), the interactions in Death's household and the backdrop of a potentially reality ripping event make for a great story.  Death was a constant scream for me.  I love how direct and simple Death is.  I also love the fact that Death wants to have a taste of life.  I was prepared to give this one only four stars, but the last 75 pages or so are so great that it kicked the book to five stars!  Mr. Pratchett does a great job presenting the characters and describing the environment they're in, making this a very enjoyable book.
B000O599WG|4.0|Rio Bravo is my favorite Duke movie and I could sit here all day and review it.  So I am soley reviewing the DVD treatment.    FILM TRANSFER    Someone said previously that this 'new' transfer was darker than the previous bare bones DVD.  I had my doubts but it's the truth.  I took screencaps of both versions, compared them and this one is definitely darker.  The other version even seems slightly sharper.  This is my biggest beef with this release.    COMMENTARY w/ RICHARD SCHICKEL & JOHN CARPENTER    For being a film historian/critic, Richard Schickel is extremely boring and I couldn't totally trust anything he said after he called the Duke's rifle a pump-action.  He also said \\"Hawksian\\" so often that I don't care to hear the word ever again.  Both him and Carpenter are essentially repeating what they say in the featurettes.  It is more about Hawks than Rio Bravo.  Angie Dickinson or someone who worked on the film would have been much better, providing us with some stories.    THE MEN WHO MADE MOVIES: HOWARD HAWKS    The Howard Hawks featurette is pretty interesting and I learned alot (although it has been pointed out as a double-dip also apearing on another Hawks' DVD.)    COMMEMORATION: HOWARD HAWKS' RIO BRAVO    Excellent featurette with alot of interviews including Angie Dickinson.  Very well produced.  I will probably watch it again in the future, which is more than I can say for most making-ofs.      OLD TUCSON: WHERE THE LEGENDS WALKED    This shorter featurette was neat.  I never even knew about Old Tucson and it was pretty fascinating.  This and 'Commemoration' are in widescreen which is hard to come by in featurettes of older movies.    JOHN WAYNE TRAILER GALLERY    Trailers from his lesser-known earlier films including The Big Stampede, Haunted Gold, Somewhere in Sonora, The Man From Monterey and Rio Bravo (of course).  It doesn't make much sense to have these on Disc 1 when the rest of the special features are on Disc 2.    This Two-Disc Special Editioncomes with some nice production photos.  If you want more of the physical stuff like that, buy the Ultimate Collector's Edition.    The film itself is unquestionably 5 stars.  But I had to knock off 1 star due to the inferior transfer, pointless commentary and overall awkward layout.  I'll keep my bare bones release for the better transfer and this too for the special features.

032147404X|4.0|I second the opinion of Brien Malone (San Diego, CA), \\"Good info, but Kelby's \\"fooled ya!\\" sense of humor is a NUISSANCE,\\" December 9, 2006.      Scott writes with a very matter-of-fact style that gives the reader only the information needed.  He doesn't attempt a dissertation or get bogged down in the minutia.    He does, however, attempt humor, which is both annoying and distracting.  In fact, there are several paragraphs where he pretends to explain something only to add a jovial \\"just kidding\\" at the end.  My time is valuable; I'm reading a photography book to learn how to take better photos, not indulge Mr. Kelby's poor attempts at being funny.      Notwithstanding, the information is concise and I will most likely purchase his newest book, Digital Photography Vol. 2, in the future (i.e., when I can buy a used copy on Amazon for cheap).
B00000IQV7|5.0|Such a wonderful movie...Robin Williams is soo hilarious...it is such a wonderful movie with such an awesome story.
B000050X31|5.0|AMAZING. The SETS: excellent - schematic, evocative and inventive - you actually SEE Tamino and Pamina going through fire and water, for example. The CAST: extraordinary - a really funny Papageno, a wonderful Pamina (Kathleen Battle is utterly credible - which is saying a lot for a fantasy - I'd die for her at the drop of a hat!!!) and as for Kurt Moll, WOW! His is the first performance I've ever seen that squares with Bernard Shaw's opinion that if God listened to music, Sarastro's music is the music he'd listen to!!!! James Levine's conducting is superb, and his friendly, understated style just brings everything home. BUY THIS, and bless me for my advice!!!
B000UD0ESA|3.0|This is for people who haven't watched all the versions (or any version).  If you are a long-time fan of the movie in one version or another, just skip this review because you'll probably hate it.<br /><br />I heard about Blade Runner for many years but never got around to seeing it.  The final cut was my first exposure to the movie.  If you are like me, these are things you should know:<br /><br />1.  It's dark.  Visually as well as plotwise.  I like noir films but have difficulty seeing dark & shadowy scenes, which in this case is most of the movie.  I think the larger & clearer you can see it, the better off you'll be.  If you've got a 20-year-old 26\\" TV, bring the movie to watch with friends who have new, big TVs because you can't understand what you can't see.<br /><br />2.  It's dark (again).  Deckard is the closest thing to a hero in this movie and he isn't exactly warm and fuzzy.  He doesn't express any more emotion than Rachel, the replicant with whom he falls in love (contributing to the \\"is Deckard a replicant or human\\" debate).  I think the reason they needed special tests to identify replicants wasn't because the replicants were so human but because all the humans were so robotic.  Ridley Scott portrays a future I hope we never see.  Very grim.  And it rained all the time in LA -- huh?<br /><br />3.  It can be confusing.  As I understand, the original release had a Deckard voiceover added after screening audiences didn't like the movie.  I think the movie is stylistically better without a voiceover, but it can be hard for new viewers like me to catch all the details.  One scene in particular confused me:  Deckard was looking at a photo in his apartment that he kept enlarging and enhancing to find small details.  What was that about?  And then the added unicorn scene that followed (more fuel for the Deckard as replicant position) confused me more.  Again because of the visual darkness & my old TV, I had to go online to realize that the last object Deckard picked up was an origami unicorn (presumably left by the cop who made origami).  If you like movies all spelled out for you, you probably won't like this movie.<br /><br />4.  No happy ending.  The original Deckard & Rachel escape to lovely woodsy places would be more \\"feel good\\" but make no sense if the Earth is so miserable people want to move off world.  The ending in this final cut is a bit abrupt for me.  They get into an elevator and all of a sudden the credits start, leaving me wondering what happened.  If you like happy endings, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />5.  Hard characters to like.  It may be that I missed something, but I didn't find anything in the replicants to make me empathize with them.  Roy has one moment of goodness after a violent and murderous swath through the movie.  If the goal of the movie was to make me think about what makes an organism a person who deserve rights to life, liberty, etc., I missed it.  I had no problem with Deckard killing the escapees.  Even Rachel, who was benign, gave me no reason to feel she should be treated as a human.  On the other hand, I didn't like any of the human characters much either.<br /><br />I gave this movie 3 stars because I still don't know whether I liked it or not.  But I was intrigued enough that I might read the Philip Dick story or watch a version with voiceover narration and then come back to this version hoping to understand it better.rn (presumably left by the cop who made origami).

B000026OW3|1.0|The first box of CD's had duplicates of CD's 1-4 (of 11 CD's).  Sent it back.  Second set received and all the tracks on Disks 1-4 had major skips and outages--just blank spaces with NO Sound.  I was truly disappointed. I sent the set back for a refund.   What I did hear of Arthur Rubinstein was truly great but the mastering was the worst I have ever heard.  With regrets I don't have this great collection of Rubinstein playing Chopin.  Amazon was great in this minor saga--got my money back.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|An Ancient Muse is a must buy can't stop listening to it, if you want to relax this is it.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is Nirvana's greatest album, more people would agree than would say otherwise. The music is fun to listen to, the lyrics are crafted to mean nothing, but somehow the listeners are able to relate to them. Kurt Cobain creates a true work of art, the other band members show a large amount of talent as well. It will go down as one of the best albums ever, I know. It is a must have for any rock fan who doesn't limit their taste to one time period.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Shame on ABC to take away such a beautifully written and directed show that any pre-teen, teen or adult could identify with! Then again, I don't know if such a show that spoke so poignantly to the times of the 90's grunge era would be able to withstand today's plastic entertainment with America's new nausiating obsession of celeb-\\"reality\\" TV.   There's either an Angela, Raianne, or Sharon in every teenage girl, and there's a Patty in every protective, good mother. There's a Graham in every caring, father that likes to cook, and there's a Brian Krakow in every girl's life if we look hard enough - even though we're too busy falling for the Jordan Catalanos. We all had friends like Ricki that we tried to protect and shelter while we yet needed their advice more than they needed ours.   Even if you don't connect to the people in this show (which wouldn't happen, as obviously stated above), please if anything, watch it for the nostalgia of the '90s where when being jaded meant being real. My So-Called-Life is an amazing show that will sub-consciously reel you in emotionally. Just like Angela, the show doesn't try to be something it's not - it's just being.  This kind of rawness, and authenticity is not presented in any other show that exists today.  Yet scripted, and yet so real, this show is perhaps \\"everyone's so called life\\", now if you excuse me, I have to see who's going to get a nose job on Dr. Beverly Hills 90210.
0751532711|4.0|I liked the book, thought the stories were inspiration.  I liked the general philosophy of wealth building this conveys as it is different.  I do wish that this book would have gone into more specific detail on \\"how to\\" do things.  I like some of this other books better than this one.
B000BT97AO|4.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it.  The imagery was completely amazing, and I just had to have the dvd.  The beauty of this is just magically stunning, and will have you spellbound.  However, to those who are allergic to the odd-be warned.  Some of my friends have described this as an acid-trippy movie, not that I can confirm that.  The plot and characters are downright confusing, but the scenes' and the settings' wonderful eye-candy more than make up for the confusion. The main idea at least is conveyed, although more through sound and sight than through words and explanations.
0446678430|5.0|I read this book and Rich Dad, Poor Dad and really felt this book was an all around better book.  It went into not only more detail explaining things, but I like the depths of stories better as well in this book.  I recommend that you buy this book.

0099532611|3.0|I'm sorry...what?<br />This book reads like a giant riddle.  It's entertaining, thought provoking and laugh-out-loud funny in places, but it's also very confusing in other places.<br />while reading this book, I got the feeling that someone had removed every third sentence.  And when I finished it, I felt like the final chapter was missing.<br />At times, you wander if Oedipa is dreaming, and then you realize she's not...but maybe she was dreaming during the last sentance....<br />It's like that.
B000ETQPYM|4.0|I really liked it.  Nothing too deep, just a nice read about friends and friendship.  I hope my husband never leaves me a \\"list\\".  hee hee.
B000LPQ6DE|3.0|This version was rather good, but if you wish to get an actual feel for the original novel--You're completely out of luck. Both Jane and Mr.Rochester's parts were acted well, and the chemistry between the two actors really made the movie, but it just wasn't the real Jane Eyre. This version diverged from the book on almost every point, even the simplest of details was reworked and rewritten. They more or less modernized it...just without changing the time period. Language was simplified (a heinous crime in my estimation for Charlotte Bronte's ease and fluidity of writing is of the utmost importance in the original--her writing was what really made the story spectacular as well as timeless), and both Jane and Mr.Rochester acted a bit more free-spirited...but in a way that just didn't suit their original characters. So all in all, great movie if you've read the book, but not to be taken as a direct interpretation.
0765348276|4.0|Great read, couldn't put it down, very original and cool.   Has significant flaws, not very profound in any sense, character development is limited; premise regarding aliens is very simplistic (how is it that all races but one are at the same developmental level? And all races are violent?), Most notably, how is it that 75 year old Americans are so naive and unquestioning? Youd think that they would have developed some skepticism about being sent off to war given USA history. This is dealt with only in passing.  So a great fun read, but not one of those great books that cause philosophical pondering or emotional impact.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|If Katrina wasn't convincing enough for US environmental policy makers then take an example of Cyclone Sidr that made millions homeless in Southern Bangladesh.It was a category 4 cyclone.The strongest ever recorded in the region.All regions of the world are getting extreme weathers and the heat from the sea as explained in Al Gore's video is evident.  I'm no scientist and I might not be an expert,but I can tell what I see.  Global warming is not a farce when people are dying and losing their way of life as a result from it.
B000VFVOX6|5.0|Positively no issues with this DVD.  Could not discern any difference in quality from this version vs. when I saw it in the theatre.  Totally enjoyed the show while watching it on a basic DVD player and color tv set.  Note, I don't have surround sound or a home theater system so I can't convey issues relative to special features there.  Basically the price was right as was the quality.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Though some may say this was an attempt at money, or that it is not the same as the old material, it is still The Eagles.    After a such a long wait to hear new material, especially with the hints and the interim music which seemed to indicate it was coming.    Is it the same as the old material?  Yes and no, with the biggest issue is that the band is competing with it's own legend which probably makes it more difficult for people to accept the new music, more so in the way the LP was released.    Despite all of these short comings, the vocals and songwriting still shines and when you put this on it is like coming home.
B00006CXSS|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this series, other than WOW.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Ok so it wasn't perfect especially the way they did the ending but I loved it anyways. I actually prefer this version to the 95 version because Rupert Penry Jones played wenworth so much better, sally hawkins portrayl of ann was wonderful, and it's a little faster paced than the older version. But they really messed up the ending, and that kiss was repulsive to watch... all that spit...yuck. overall, of all the new itv adaptations, this one is the best. Northanger abbey was cute. Don't even bother with mansfield park, billy piper just ruined it. You'd do better with the 1999 version with Frances occoner.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Kung Fu (or Kung Fu Hustle as I understand the title is open to debate) is a terrifically fun movie to watch. The comedy is not quite so prevalent as in Shaolin Soccer and there is a darker side to this movie with more violence, but it is so thoroughly engaging and entertaining that I could watch it over and over and over.<br />Stephen Chow brings the goods; the insane kung fu, the Looney Tunes moments, the hilarious characters, and the warm back story of Chow's character and his childhood introduction to a deaf mute girl, and wraps it up in this non-stop action packed darkly comedic delight.<br />How movies like this go unnoticed while tripe like Rush Hour gets made ad nauseum is a mystery to me, but if you enjoy this genre, you will love this movie. Highly recommended.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Loved this light hearted witty adaptation of northanger abbey. Of the itv new adaptations, I enjoyed this one and persuasion the most. The actors in this piece are superb. I just wanted to eat JJ Fields up, he's just adorable. And the actress who portrayed Catherine was just perfect, a good combination of innocence combined with overzealous imagination. A must have for any Jane  Austen fan.
B00005JOHC|5.0|The first season DVD of \\"Two and a Half Men\\",like every episode of the show,is a major treat.    What you have here is a four-disc set with all twenty-four episodes from the first season of \\"Two and a Half Men\\",uncut and unedited. The episodes,while not rocket science,move along chronilogically to an appropriate and certain extent. It may sound like a stretch. Yet,depsite that,it is the fire and energy of \\"Two and a Half Men\\". This is the season where Alan Harper(Jon Cryer)was struggling to make ends meet by living with his older brother Charlie(Charlie Sheen)in the middle of his divorce from his wife Judith(Marin Hinkle)and being a single father to his son Jake(Angus T. Jones). The order helps \\"Two and a Half Men\\" come to life--in despite of its humor and,throughout certain times,the \\"dramatic\\" moments. The overall plot for the first season of \\"Two and a Half Men\\" creates antic humor that,instead of running low along the way,just gets better. It is humor that gives the situation several problems for the characters and gives several certain aspects to draw and come to life from. It works more than perfect for the humor written in it. With the richly executed style and talent in which the episodes are written,being brought to life by representation and the performances of the characters,the first season of \\"Two and a Half Men\\" is,by far,a winner. An excellent starting place for one of the funniest and most popular shows on television--period.    To make things even better,the first season of \\"Two and a Half Men\\" couldn't have been better packaged. There are a total of three bonus feautures in this DVD set. The first feauturette,\\"Two Adults,One Kid,No Grown-Ups:Go Behind the Scenes with Cast and Crew\\",tells how \\"Two and a Half Men\\" began and goes behind the scenes of the show's production,providing several interesting and enjoying facts. The second,\\"Backstage Tour with Angus T. Jones\\",finds Angus T. Jones giving a tour of the set of \\"Two and a Half Men\\",showing how itis filmed and what life on the set is like. And then,you have a Gag Reel--which feautures several memorable and hillarious outtakes from the filming of the first season of \\"Two and a Half Men\\". Add all of that together with the ***entire*** set having good photographs from the episodes that are to be found here,alongside a booklet that has info on the episodes,you are in  luck with the first season DVD of \\"Two and a Half Men\\".    Even if you just watch \\"Two and a Half Men\\" occasionally,still,don't forget to buy this DVD. It is the perfect way to sit back,have a good laugh,and be well acquainted with \\"Two and a Half Men\\",while no DVD ever represented a show so well.

0316010669|2.0|This book gave me a keener awareness of how much information is communicated through facial expressions and first impressions, and the pragmatism of learning to read and interpret them better--but little on how to do that.     The book would have been enormously better if written in less than a quarter of its length. The author drones on and on with example after example, often needlessly coming back to earlier ones. This lack of conciseness contributes to a general feeling of wondering what he's trying to say--and wondering if it's really clear in his own mind. On the one hand, we should be able to size people up in an instant, and on the other, that's how we perpetuate stereotypes. It's really not until the Afterword that the author acknowledges, more straightforwardly, that a balance is not easy to learn or achieve. Only experience over time can help us get a feel for it. In the end, we're left with no really practical advice to implement in our daily lives, beyond greater awareness.    At one point, I got excited, thinking some practical advice was just around the bend. We are told there exists a training tape for learning facial micro-expressions. In 35 minutes of training, one can go from seeing none of such expressions to seeing them all! \\"This is an accessible skill,\\" we're told. And then, end of discussion. No mention of how WE can learn from this tape (rent it, buy it, go to a seminar, employ a consultant, read a synopsis?). This is the one thing the author has built us up to want to know, and we're left with a sort of \\"Gotcha!\\"    I found the entire Afterword to be a lazy avoidance of revising the book before reprinting. All the points made there, including too much rehashing, should be incorporated into the book itself. Both here and in the body of the book, I always had the feeling the author was still thinking--not really sure exactly where he wanted to take this book. I especially did not appreciate the tediously elaborated military examples; talk about too much information! We did not need to know every little facet that the author mused while digesting his research and mountain of anecdotes.    I don't feel the little I learned was worth the time spent hanging onto the book in the hope of finding its redemption.
0434012602|5.0|I came to the American classics later in life (in my 30s), which was a good turn, as I discovered, by reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"<br /><br />As a student, I didn't read for pleasure, so I looked at book assignments like work. Now that I have time, I really enjoy books like Harper's, which so easily slide you into confrontations of social consequence and make you think and decide where you stand.<br /><br />I listened to \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" on tape and the performance (by a woman) was riveting. As an aspiring author, I would love to write like Harper Lee, so casual and calm in her manner, she took me to Macon, Alabama on the rails of her southern prose.<br /><br />And Atticus Finch is a character whose character every statemen should aspire to.
B000FA57N0|5.0|I am a Firefly and Serenity fan, so the movie itself was great.  However, when I saw it on HD-DVD, it got taken to a whole new level!  Definitely the best picture I have seen on any movie in HD so far!
B00007EL92|5.0|I have tortured over whether this DVD-A release of Elvis Presley deserves a 4 rating or a 5. It seems a bit unfair to award a 4 though, as it's been beautifully and carefully mixed for 5.1 sound. Apart from that, anyone that releases music on a hi-res format (DVD-A or SACD) deserves to be praised in my opinion. It's high time that the standard CD died out, and made way for these better formats. On the other hand, this release is a bit of a missed opportunity, as it doesn't offer any other audio options, apart from compressed Dolby Digital 5.1 or high definition MLP 5.1. Although this means that anyone with a DVD player can play this disc (something to be praised), why weren't stereo and/or mono options offered? This is exactly what was offered on the superb Beach Boys Pet Sounds DVD-A. Such options surely widen the appeal of these releases, pleasing both those that insist that music should be released in the originally released format, but also offering a new twist for those that like surround mixed music. As mentioned briefly before though, I feel the 5.1 mix has been very subtly arranged, creating a very \\"delicate\\" surround feel.    What else do you get for your money? Well, the disc comes in a standard CD jewel case, as opposed to the more common DVD-A Super Jewel Box. It appears to have a generic booklet supplied, which would have also been provided with the CD release, and a one sheet sleeve mentioning the benefits of DVD Audio. All the tracks listed by Amazon amount to about 80 minutes of music - which is good. A slight pity that absolutely no video or on screen info is provided about the disc, but at least somebody had the confidence to do a DVD-A release in the first place. We need a lot more hi-res releases!!
B00005JPMZ|3.0|As a guy who grew up during the height of the turtles frenzy, this is my view of the turtles on film, I still like the first live action film the best, and thought the sequels stank.  When I heard of a new turtles film that was going to be CGI I was kinda skeptical at first but considering that only the first live action film was good, I decided to give it a shot.  Well to start off, there were two noticeable changes that I actually liked which was that it was darker than the live action sequels and it was actually more mature for example getting rid of the cowabunga and so forth.  I was overall split on the story because I liked it being about the turtles coming back together to again be a crime fighting team but didn't like the ancient immortal tyrant and his generals capturing monsters to bring an army of monsters through a portal to take over the world when really the tyrant only wanted to die.  I feel this didn't bring the turtles back in full force with a knock out punch, I miss the foot clan with shredder leading  having always been the turtles greatest foe, but hey there's hope because there was a hint at the end for a possible return and the film was a financial success, let's just hope it's better the next time around.
B00125JP1C|5.0|I thought this movie was great! It was great mindless action and corney one-liners. What do you expect from a movie called Shoot'Em Up! Overall it deserves about 3 stars, but I had fun watching it, and had to balance out the score against the snobs.
0790729628|5.0|Nobody does sets better than Ridley Scott.  The sets on Blade Runner do not suffer from the dreaded \\"outdated technology set\\" that often plagues science fiction movies after they have been out a while and this is attributable to Ridley Scott. The gritty Sci/Fi setting is perfect. The acting across the board is amazing.  The movie is full of iconic images and lines.  Leon alone has a couple iconic lines, \\"Let me tell you about my mother\\" and \\"Wake up, time to die\\" and who can forget the lines and image of Roy at the end of the movie?  Blade Runner is a timeless classic!<br /><br />There is an updated version of the movie now available and would recommend that to fans of the movie and this version to people just wanting to add to their collection.
B000W1V44I|1.0|Wow, this album is so monotonous... I really miss the greats like Backstreet's Back etc. I got this dirt cheap from a sale in Singapore and I feel the price is too expensive for such dull music. I want my S$8 back (US$5).    Maybe this is the album to break up the Backstreet Boys for good,

B000EGEVZK|5.0|The 1977 New Years Eve Rainbow Concert footage on this DVD makes this a relevant historical piece. Rock and roll is rarely depicted in such a live, energetic and aggressive manner. Thank goodness the audio and video from that concert are in such great condition.  It's worth owning this DVD just for the Rainbow Concert concert, but watch everything else too.  It's lots of fun.
B00008BRBG|4.0|The Police burst on to the scene at the height of the punk explosion in England.  Although embraced by the punk crowd The Police were never really a punk band.  In fact they were something of an all star project.  Drummer Stewart Copeland had come from the progressive rock world of Curved Air.  Andy Summers had been a member of The Soft Machine, The Animals and even a touring member of Neil Sedaka's band.  All music that was the antithesis of what Punk was rebelling against.  From a purely musical perspective all 3 of these guys could play rings around the majority of punk bands of the day. Along with Summers and Copeland vocalist / bassist Sting (Gordon Sumner) completed the trio and they pretty much set the world on fire right out of the gate.  \\"D'amour\\" contained the huge hit single \\"Roxanne\\" and the rest as they say is history.  I kind of came late to the Polices early albums and kind of wrote them off at the time they were released, but going back now I think this is a really strong effort.  The album is all over the place musically with elements of rock, reggae, jazz and even some experimental stuff thrown into the mix.  3 big hits came from the album \\"Roxanne\\", \\"So Lonely\\" and \\"Can't Stand Loosing You\\", and the album cuts are just as good if not better.  I especially like the last half of the album with \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\", \\"Born In The 50's\\", \\"Be My Girl - Sally\\", and \\"Masoko Tanga\\".  It is easy to see why these guys rocketed to success as fast as they did.
0618680004|5.0|A well written book, with clearly argued points.  A pleasure to read.  I plan to read all of Dawkins's books now!
B00008BRDX|4.0|The Police were on their way to the top already by the time this; their second album was released in 1979.  The title means something like \\"White Reggae\\" and indeed there is a lot of reggae influence to be found on this disc.  Along with the reggae the album pretty much goes in a bunch of different directions almost as if the band was struggling to find just what kind of sound that they wanted to put out there.  Overall this is another strong album from the Police.  A couple of huge hits came from this disc \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"Walking On The Moon\\" and the non single tracks are all good as well.  This one fits in well between the album that proceeded and the album that followed it and should be a part of any Police collection.

B000K15VSA|5.0|This is a well put together package.  From the case to the included unicorn and spinner, you'll love having this in your collection.  Unlike George Lucas, Mr. Ridley Scott understands the public may have its own favorite version other than his own, and has thus included all four versions of the film (orginal US release, UK, Director's Cut, and Final Cut) for you to choose from.  A MUST HAVE!
B000YABV90|5.0|Robin Williams should get the oscar for supporting actor, and this film should get best original score. Great Movie
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I ordered these to replace a couple year old pair of Sennheisers (which I was very happy with).  After receiving the...I spent days...weeks...listening to my music collection again - because it was a whole new experience.  The bass response is wonderful and the clarity is unlike anything else I've heard.  I  use these for both recreational use and professional use (media relations for a major DJ) I often wear them at work - and although Sony doesn't advertise their passive noise canceling abilities...I can't hear *anything* except my music - which is great cause I often do complicated mathematics and interruptions from coworkers talking loudly is bad.  I would also recommend these for anyone who has to monitor spoken voice (such as call center monitoring).<br /><br />Two negatives I'd list....first, if you intend to listen to MP3's that are not 128kbps or above...forget it, they are going to sound horrible - these headphones are *not* forgiving for poor recording quality - same with streaming music, gotta be 128kbps or it will sound like like your grandmothers record player.  The other negative are two cabled that are found on each side - looks like if I screw up I could snag these and pull them out.<br /><br />Neither of the negatives I found are enough for me to remove a star.  The first is the fault of poor quality recordings, not the headphones.  The second is minor and will only cause you a problem if you mishandle them.
B000007PSR|4.0|I like this album very much. There is some very interesting music here. I am not crazy about every song here, but most tracks are good. If you like classic Pink Floyd, you may not like this too much. I would recommend this to any Syd Barrett fan. The audio quality is quite good on many of the songs. Some of the tracks are rough demos.Good collection if you like Syd.
B00005JPTI|3.0|This film is definitely worthy of the matinee price of admission.  After I Robot I dreaded another butchering of a famous book starring Will Smith.  However, I was happily surprised.  It is unfortunate that the general audience would have not fully appreciated the book had they gone with that story and ending, ie he is a legendary monster to the next phase of man but they did a decent job of the tweaking.  Drawbacks  1) Its not Mathesons story so to squeak in the \\"this is his legend\\" voice over bit at the end felt painful.    2) I didn't really need to see Will Smith doing pull ups half naked for such a long time.  In fact I didn't need to see it at all.  3) As a golfer, the scene with him hitting of a wing of a stealth bomber with no apparent grass matt was pretty damned dumb but so was speeding around the streets of NY.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|You'll love this if you enjoy Méhdi, John Tesh Enya or other soothing music artists. It is the very essence of good music. So tranquil, yet so spirited, this cd is a refreshing break from my well-worn collection, I just keep wanting to listen to it over and over again. I am amazed! It reminds me somewhat of their other works, but still very unique. This is music to the soul.     ALSO RECOMMENDED: Méhdi ~ [[ASIN:B000PGQEIG Instrumental Paradise Volume 8]]... A True Gem.

B000YENUI6|5.0|I liked this movie much better than Cronenberg's previous History of Violence.<br />Imagine: a German, a Frenchman, and a Dane (Mueller-Stahl, Cassel, Mortensen) are heading the London chapter of the Russian Mafia, or at least of a branch of it. (Can't claim that I know much about this company.)<br />What an odd tribe! What strange customs! And who could say that EEC doesn't work!<br />The plot is gripping (has been summarized by others here, no need to repeat), the characters are not entirely new (some similarities in Italy and the US perhaps?), maybe one could see a structural parallel to 'Road to Perdition' (i.e. Mueller-Stahl as Newman, Cassel as Craig, Mortensen as Hanks). But I won't say more so as not to give away the suspense. Just one hint: Jude Law is not in it.His position is taken by two no-name leathermen with crooked knives, who can't get the job done.<br />And yes, nearly forgot: Naomi Watts is also there, not a bad show.<br />I wonder how a Russian would see the movie. Any comments from a Russian reader here?<br />I did get an idea what a Russian audience would say. I watched the movie in a copy taken in a Russian cinema. Once in a while, the audience laughed. Two such laughing moments were particularly surprising. One was when a man gets a knife in his eye. Ok, that may count as funny in some places. The other one was when the Russian uncle of the Naomi character, played by a Pole (Jerzy Skolimowski), spoke Russian to one of the gangsters. That seems to have sounded hilarious.<br />But oddly, nobody laughed when the Dane or the Frenchman spoke Russian. That either means, that Viggo and Cassel did a great job at learning the language, or that they were beyond funny. Cross cultural communication never ceases to provide suprises.<br />P.S. after comments on the level of the spoken Russian I must acknowledge that the movie is a failure in some respects. It was not meant as a comedy, but turns out to be funny for Russian viewers. That's a serious dent in the splendor.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Ever since the early 90's (when TV peaked with TWIN PEAKS) had I to come across such an engaging Series! Weird (in a good way), Insightful and Intelligent - and with much better luck with scheduling and ratings.<br /><br />The secret in my opinion: truly SMART writing; well-ahead planed plot and characters not only interesting but also one cares about to follow week after week!<br />Faith and Reason, Fate and Choice, Dogma and Intuition, Nature and Nurture, Good and Evil are, all, in a constant dynamic equilibrium, raising everyday issues under extraordinary conditions to render all the hues discernible and debatable.<br />Come for the story, stay for the Philosophy.<br /><br />If you liked the X-FILES you will appreciate the mythology been interwoven with the action (instead of mythology episodes alternating with action episodes and, thus, pretty much ruining the rhythm of the series).<br />If you liked TWIN PEAKS you will appreciate the skewed reality and the blurry boundaries between reality and fantasy.<br /><br />The 3rd Season surpassed even the 1st one in plot twists and reversals. Lighter on background stories, it focused more on the Others and Ben's hold on them through the spectral and mysterious Jacob. It also featured one of the gutsier cliffhangers ever: a flash-forward that, had it not been pulled off so skillfully, it would have killed all interest in the show.<br />True, as expected after the huge success of the show, some...dilution is detectable (the producers are probably worried of running out of ideas) - yet we should be counting our blessings. Even the worse LOST episode is much better than anything else on the air.<br /><br />This DVD release features 6 disks on the episodes and a 7th one with all the extra features: out-takes, locations, interviews, bloopers and commentaries.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
0385522401|3.0|The author develops his characters wonderfully. You feel so sad when  all these events takes place, where these two people are so unable to  bring forth emotions and deal with the matter at hand, so crippled.
1594489505|4.0|This book started out slow for me, I was having a really difficult time getting an interest. I think once the book started to follow the life of Laila and Tariq my interest was peaked, then I plowed right through and could not put it down! I'm not a history buff, but this book gives the background on life in Afghanastan and how it is for women....this book touched on many of my emotions, I was crying, I was angry, at the end I was glad and I was sad.....wonderful story, I would read it again and again!!!
0375842209|1.0|I found \\"Death\\" supercilious, snide and surprisingly sentimental. Obviously written for children, very repetitive. Also, I think calling Leisle a \\"book thief\\" was a little over done. She doesn't become a thief until she's shown that the books are hers for the taking, even destroying.    This book covered a serious time, was filled w/redundant, often unnecessary cursing, highly repetitive and irritating.    I deeply resented this book and found it tedious. I do not understand these ridiculous praises for it!
1401300529|5.0|The critiques of this book can be divided into two fairly narrow categories. If the reader is interested in the conflict from a deeply historical prospective and wants to focus on the political aspects of the Korean War, this is a fabulous book. I found myself unable to either put the book down or read at a very fast pace. I found the interaction of the world players, their goals and objectives, and their actions to be fascinating and very well documented. Alternatively, if the reader is interested in following all of the battles in detail, the reader will be very disappointed. The book only covers a handful of battles and if the battle has been described in other books dedicated to that single battle, there might be a single page thereon. (Bill Barber was a friend of mine and one of the heroes of the Chosin Damn battles and I was disappointed that the battle is covered in less than a page or two.)    A simple decision: political and historical interest: buy it today; battle by battle interest: many better books on the subject.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|I simply enjoy listening to solid melodies, good muscianship,and some kind of message somewhere, and this CD gave all that to me and more.  Plus, it got better and better with each listening, and after a week or so, I'm still not sick of it!
B000H0MKOC|4.0|One of the many ironies in this blatant satire (which is NOT a documentary) is that at no time is anybody seen smoking!  No Hollywood cinematic light ups.  Even Nick Naylor, who is vice president of the smoking PR conglomerate, does not actually light up on screen.  We see him once look into an empty pack of cigarettes wishing he had one, that's it.<br /><br />The joke on the square is that although this movie is about smoking nobody associated with the movie wants to be accused of supporting smoking in any way.  Now you might think that, well, a movie that puts smoking in a bad light as this movie does, certainly is not what the tobacco companies want to see.  However, if the movie producers also threw in a few scenes with the stars puffing happily away, the message would surely be mixed.<br /><br />No mixed messages here.  Aaron Eckhart who stars as Nick Naylor is a sort of charming sociopath.  He describes himself as the kind of guy who could get any woman into bed.  In an relentlessly ironic follow up to that we have Katie Holmes playing an intrepid reporter for the \\"Washington Probe\\" newspaper who gets him into bed, all the better to get him to reveal all his dirty secrets and dirty tricks.  He was owned, so to speak, and taken advantage of sexually.<br /><br />Eckhart is perfect for the part with his handsome winning ways.  You may recall that he played a corporate sexist pig sociopath in the critically acclaimed film In the Company of Men (1997), which I highly recommend.  (See my review.)  Here he is a little sweeter, a little more charming, and amazingly enough a good role model for his son Joey (Cameron Bright), who, by the way, has a lot of sharp lines and delivers them well.  How this is pulled off is something to behold, for sure.  But basically the rationale is that Nick is doing it all \\"to pay the mortgage\\" (\\"the yuppie Nuremberg defense\\") and that is the lesson that Joey learns, and presumably he will be able to adapt to more socially correct employment when he grows up.<br /><br />Some satirical bits include the Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott) with cancer getting a bribe; a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy) holding a senate hearing about getting a skull and crossbones logo put on cigarette packages while Nick tells him that the Vermont cows and their cheese are causing clogged arteries and heart attacks; Nick hanging out with a RP person representing the interests of alcohol (Maria Bello), and another (David Koechner) whoring for the gun industry.  They like to sit around over dinner and compare the number of people their products have killed.<br /><br />Robert Duvall has a modest part as the \\"Captain\\" of tobacco and Rob Lowe gets to play Jeff Megall, a big time, Machiavellian Hollywood money man, who is lining up Catherine Zeta-Jones and I forget who, to play a naked in a space movie with some serious smoking scenes--for a price to be paid for by Big Tobacco.  The joke here is that this practice has long been a source of Hollywood film production up-front revenue.  There's a scene showing old Hollywood stars with PC touch ups of their movies, showing them with lolly-pops or pencils hanging out of their mouths instead of cigarettes.<br /><br />The script (adapted from a novel by Christopher Buckley, son of conservative pundit William F. Buckley) and direction by Jason Reitman deserve some kind of award for originality.  The film is definitely a put down of industry PR people, yet somehow it makes them look human.Some satirical bits include the Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott) with cancer getting a bribe; a senator from Vermont (William H.

B00000250H|4.0|I must say that I bought her cd not really knowing who she was as a person and after listening to her cd, I felt like I really did get to know a little about her.  I love this cd!!  My purpose in buying it has succeeded!
B000K15VSA|5.0|My wife bought this for me for Christmas (I had to sign into her account because she was the one who purchased it) and this collectors edition is one of the best gifts I have ever received!  I have been a fan of this film for, well, 25 years and I my appreciation has just grown over the years.  After viewing the collectors edition though, I have a whole new outlook on this very influential movie.<br /><br />For those other \\"Blade-philes\\" out there - I read Paul Sammon's book cover to cover and was only able to imagine all that he wrote about.  Now I was able to experience it first hand.  Not only do you get all these versions  of the movie (Theatrical, Director's cut, International cut, work-print , and Final Cut) but you also get hours of interviews from the actors, director, crew... you get screen tests, art work, behind the scenes footage, extra scenes - I mean it just goes on and on.  It is extremely thorough and the attention to detail is apparent in every respect - packaging, design, content etc... I'm sure Mr. Sammon must have had a hand in this release.  I still haven't finished watching every disc - it truly is the gift that keeps on giving !  Sorry to gush so much, I have never seen anything on the market that goes this in-depth with the making of a film before - and the fact that this much care went into a Blade Runner collector's edition is a dream come true!<br /><br />The only thing that I don't see in this collection (maybe I just haven't gotten to it yet - but it doesn't appear in the booklet that describes the contents) is, surprisingly, any insight to the sound track.  I am not a big Vangelis fan, however, his work on the sound track was great and extremely appropriate (except for the awful end credits theme - really the only thing that dates this movie).<br /><br />One last word - the Final Cut itself looks amazing - the restoration / enhancement was very noticeable.<br /><br />It seems to me that the only low scores for this collection had to do will packaging deformities (i.e. missing discs etc...) and not the content it self.  In short, can't recommend it highly enough - a must have for any Blade Runner fan!s (i.e. missing discs etc...) and not the content it self.  In short, can't recommend it highly enough - a must have for any Blade Runner fan!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Sicko is perhaps best described as an expos&eacute; by Michael Moore on the disgusting failings of the American health care industry to pay for necessary medical procedures even though their customers have paid their premiums and \\"played by the rules.\\" We see heartrending stories of Americans treated cruelly, to say the least, by their health insurance carriers. Just as many other reviewers note, there are pathetic, sad stories of grown parents having to move in with their children because they went bankrupt paying for three heart attacks; and there's the story of a 79 year old man who has to work at a Pathmark supermarket doing heavy lifting so that he and his aged wife can have the medicines they need every day.<br /><br />The horror stories continue, mostly with the fat cats of the health care companies getting seven figure annual salaries based on how much health care they deny to their \\"customers.\\" We learn from professionals and analysts that the less care any health insurance company gives the more money they make--and their executives get rich on this terrible truth.<br /><br />There is one scene in which a doctor tells a Congressional hearing that she is still haunted by a decision she made to deny a man a life-necessary operation. As a result of her decision she was promoted to a six figure a year job. Moore also notes that Hillary Clinton did try to get universal health care but her idea died before it could become a reality.<br /><br />Moore travels to other countries to see what they do there about insuring people's health. We learn that in Canada, England, Norway, and France, socialized medicine is quite acceptable because the citizens of these countries truly believe that they should have health care for all. Naturally, this is done through much higher taxes; but at least they never worry about a hospital stay, getting tough pre-approvals for life saving procedures and more.<br /><br />You'll easily remember the Michael Moore \\"stunt;\\" he takes rescue workers from September 11th and sails to Cuba with them so that they can get free health care at Guantanamo Bay. Fortunately for the workers they do get treated on the island although they don't get their treatment on the military base.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I must say that I think Moore painted the picture of these other countries a bit too rosy. I have friends in Holland who certainly don't live as well as the foreigners interviewed in their homes by Michael Moore. In addition, how fast you get health care in other countries often depends on how sick you are--you may have to wait ten months for a hip replacement if doctors there decide that you can wait.<br /><br />Overall, however, Michael Moore makes his case a very solid one; and I certainly agree with him on this issue. We should have at least an optional universal health care program so that people who don't want to participate don't feel forced into it.<br /><br />The DVD has a plethora of extras that really add a lot to the experience of watching the movie. There are great interview segments with Tony Benn, a former member of Britain's Parliament; and we see Moore having an \\"extra\\" premiere of his film in a Los Angeles ghetto with audience members who probably can't even afford to see the movie in a movie theater. There is more footage still of Michael Moore and legislators in Washington fighting for universal health care.<br /><br />Sicko is a fine film by Michael Moore that cries out for universal health care.

0321525655|5.0|The evolving interconnectedness of our social and business communities relies heavily on our ability to communicate with one another. As some communication has become more ephemeral (email, IM), others have become slightly more formal (presentations), involving a larger and often diverse audience.    Garr Reynolds has produced and incredibly beautiful book highlighting the virtues of a zen aesthetic as it applies to communication, specifically presentations.    This book brings a sense of mindfulness to the \\"art\\" of presenting, which covers the multiple stages of presentation from idea to stage. Reading it once was a joy, but I'm sure that I'll be reaching for this book as a source of inspiration and reference when embarking on a presentation of any kind.    This book is a true gem, highly recommended.
B000XA5K48|4.0|first let me start off by saying if you are looking for a movie that has substance in the form of meaningful thought provoking, that you and your friends discuss about some \\"current event\\" in the world today, steer very clear of this. if you are looking for a movie that rivals that of any movie that has a larger meaning in it, steer very very clear of this...     but if you are looking for a movie that lets you indulge in the guilty pleasures of action, sex and just a good time, by all means this is a movie for you. shoot em up is exactly what the name implies, its straight forward guns, babes and cheesy one-liners that will have you just wanting more and more! from the moment the movie opens it is \\"_alls out\\" action, lots of shooting, stunts and loud noises to piss off the neighbors because of the surround sound. it is a movie that leaves you walking out going that was rad! and then gets you back into the real world. it seems that almost every movie today that comes out has to touch on some social commentary, which is great but sometimes you dont want to think you just want to be entertained. this movie may not get any academy award nods, but who cares? its about kicking a_s and thats it! seriously if i would have seen this movie when i was a
B00005JM02|5.0|I enjoyed the movie immensely...  the characters, the colors, the technical finesse, etal.  No wonder it was the demo movie for almost every flat screen in the stores!!<br /><br />My reservations:  I would skip a few chapters ahead if I were to show the movie to a child.  There's the mother's death, the \\"I hate you Dad,\\" and the defiance of a very bad bad fish.  Then again, without these we would have no movie.<br /><br />If I were Marlin, I would have slapped the crap out of Nemo once I found him.  Okay, I'll lighten up.
B00007KWHG|5.0|The Very Best of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons gives us a good sized collection of hits by Frankie Valli both with The Four Seasons and on his own. I really like that about this CD--you get four tracks by Frankie Valli as a soloist and that's grand.<br /><br />\\"Sherry\\" opens the CD with an early rocking tune that has a doo wop twist to it; this was very popular when it was first released and even all these years later it's not hard to understand why. They sing this to perfection and the beat is excellent. What a great song about a young love! \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\" is a very good number that rocks well and you can easily hear Frankie's voice just above the others. They all sing very well, of course--make no mistake about it. I also really like \\"Walk Like A Man\\" about a youthful man who must be strong after his girlfriend dumps him. They harmonize so well, too!<br /><br />\\"Dawn (Go Away)\\" has a great beat and they sing this with panache; the musical arrangement makes great use of the guitars and the percussion. \\"Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby Goodbye)\\" is another song about a young love that cannot be because they don't want to cheat on their current girlfriends; and \\"Opus 17\\" is a masterpiece with a heavenly melody that impresses me every time I hear it.<br /><br />Of course, there are those tracks from Frankie Valli as a soloist. Of these I really like \\"My Eyes Adored You\\" performed by a more mature Frankie Valli; his tenor voice is excellent and the melody is hauntingly beautiful. \\"Swearin' To God\\" is another tune that proves irresistible when Frankie sings it. I love it! Last but certainly not least we also get Frankie singing the theme song to the movie Grease. What a great arrangement!<br /><br />Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons live on through their great music; and the sound quality on this album doesn't disappoint me. I highly recommend this CD for fans of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons.
0345494997|3.0|I found the book to be a slow, tedious read. Being a Chicagoan, I am familiar with the genius of Frank Lloyd Wright. Being a woman, I understand the frustration the protagonist must have felt being ahead of her times. However, I felt the book overlooked much of the theory behind Wright's work, and the author did not allow me to empathize with Mamah. She deserted her children. She really seemed to work half-heartedly. She was never fully developed as a character. There was a fabulous potential here.
0743298039|4.0|Lately, I've read a good number of books about books.  The joy of the printed words, the delicious feel of being completely absorbed in a book, the hold certain characters can have on a reader long after their literary home has been shelved.  As a book lover myself, naturally I agree with all of this.<br /><br />\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\", while also about the power of stories, shows the darker side of written fantasy.  The narrator, Margaret Lea, is not so much living her life through books as avoiding her life with the use of books.  She works in her father's bookshop all day, lives above it at night, and seems to exist only for eight o'clock in the evening, when she can start to read for hours and hours.  She prefers nineteenth century works - ones about a time long past, ones with a definitive beginning, middle and end.  Ones with order, ones that don't leave the reader wanting or wondering.<br /><br />\\"I pushed my pile of papers to one side, stroked Shadow and stared into the fire, longing for the comfort of a story where everything had been planned well in advance, where the confusion of the middle was invented only for my enjoyment, and where I could measure how far away the solution was by feeling the thickness of the pages still to come.\\"<br /><br />But this story, and the many stories contained within, do not promise an easily reached solution.  There is doubt, uncertainty, suspicion, lies.  The whole book moves between truth and fiction, between life and death, shadow and light.  It is a vivid contrast between the stories that people live and the stories people tell.<br /><br />\\"People disappear when they die.  Their voice, their laughter, the warmth of their breath.  Their flesh. Eventually their bones.  All living memory of them ceases.  This is both dreadful and natural.  Yet for some reason there is an exception to this annihilation.  For in the books they write, they continue to exist.  We can rediscover them.  Their humor, their tone of voice, their moods.  Through the written word they can anger you or make you happy.  They can comfort you. They can perplex you.  They can alter you.  All this, even though they are dead. Like flies in amber, like corpses frozen in ice, that which according to the laws of nature should pass away is, by the miracle of ink on paper, preserved.  It is a kind of magic.\\"<br /><br />One day she receives a letter from Vida Winter, a famous novelist, asking her to come to Yorkshire and listen to her story, and so begins a ghostly adventure of mystery, sorrow and discovery.  This story, as with all the stories Margaret reads, consumes her...but this one forces her to actively participate in order to reach a conclusion.  And even then...there are still many questions.<br /><br />Vida is a storyteller, first and foremost, and the truth is foreign to her.  So many times she has been pressed for \\"the truth\\", and every time she has created another story.  Stories, to Vida and to Margaret, have more life than life itself.<br /><br />The reader is warned very early on that Vida may be unreliable when it comes to concrete facts, but Margaret, too, holds back.  The ghost of the unspoken facts haunts this book along with so many other ghosts.  Ghosts of lives lost, lives never lived, ghosts from other books (Jane Eyre and Rebecca, etc.)...this novel is truly haunted.<br /><br />Time is ethereal as well.  Not only is the time period of the book merely a rough sketch, the reader loses track of time through Margaret.<br /><br />\\"The end of my nine o'clocks was another anchor in time gone.  I listened to her story, I wrote the story, when I slept I dreamed the story, and when I was awake it was the story that formed the constant backdrop of my thoughts.  It was like living entirely inside a book.  I didn't even need to emerge to eat, for I could sit at my desk reading my transcript while I ate the meals that Judith brought to my room.  Porridge meant it was morning.  Soup and salad meant lunchtime.  Steakand kidney pie was evening.  I remember pondering for a long time over a dish of scrambled egg.  What did it mean?  It could mean anything.\\"<br /><br />I loved the gradual unraveling of this mystery.  Reading this book was like sitting in an old library on a gloomy day in a comfortable, though slightly musty chair.  Somewhere there is a fire and in the back of one's mind there is a thought of food and drink, but the story provides the warmth, the nourishment.<br /><br />\\"Do you know the feeling when you start reading a new book before the membrane of the last one has had time to close behind you?

As I often complain, some of the really airy-fairy supernatural stuff I find annoying. But I thought the story and the characters were interesting. I tried not to read too much into anything, so I got [pleasantly] surprised along the way as well. After reading Anansi Boys recently (finally!), I'm already anticipating my reread of American Gods.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- and it's harder to imagine a more perfect adaptation than this one.<br /><br />In fact, the 2006 adaptation has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, eerie direction, sensual romance, and a pair of magnificent leading actors. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.<br /><br />Jane Eyre (Georgie Henley) was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school. But many years later, Jane (Ruth Wilson) moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.<br /><br />Then she runs into her employer, Mr. Rochester (Toby Stephens), a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat (Christina Cole).<br /><br />But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and a mysterious locked tower. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. And Jane must face losing the man she loves forever...<br /><br />I have to get this out of the way -- I love \\"Jane Eyre,\\" and have searched for a beautiful, FAITHFUL adaptation for ages. Well, this is it -- a gorgeous, powerful adaptation, which also sticks to the original novel. A few things are shortened or fleshed out, but overall it's not just faithful to the story -- it's faithful to the atmosphere.<br /><br />Director Susanna White doesn't get bogged down in billowy period clothes and wooden acting. Instead, we get the sensual, passionate side of the story, with lots of frustrated romance, sexual tension and a strong bond between two hearts. There are some more lighthearted moments -- wedding shopping, for example -- but also opulant, even dreamlike moments, such as the \\"owl\\" jump near the end.<br /><br />And she wraps it in some truly gorgeous visuals, usually in the classic gothic romance style -- looming dark halls, white-robed women, mysterious happenings in the night, misty moors and dark firelit rooms. The entire movie seems bathed in a pale luminous light, as if the sun never quite shines over Thornfield (and Jane and Rochester) until the very end of the story.<br /><br />The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman. I spent most of the time fidgeting and wondering when Rochester was going to be back. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.<br /><br />Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens are absolutely MADE for these roles. Wilson isn't really pretty, but she has a striking, luminous quality. And she's pretty brilliant at the passionate stuff (\\"You think that because I am poor, plain, obscure and little... that I have NO HEART!\\"), but just as good at the quiet moments.<br /><br />And Stephens looks worn and kind of tired for awhile, but he can be gloriously mercurial -- prickly, gruff, fiery and even mischievous. They're both backed by a glorious cast of actors, with Georgie Henley a standout as little Jane, Cole as a snotty fortune-hunter, and Claudia Coulter as a suitably unhinged (yet still beautiful) Bertha.<br /><br />There have been many adaptations of \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but the misty, haunting 2006 adaptation trumps them all.

B000000OE7|4.0|What would one expect from a posthumous album from Queen featuring Freddie Mercury?  This is far from just an opportunistic way to rehash and commemorate Freddie's passing.<br /><br />What will surprise listeners is how good and fresh this sounds.  The opening track \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" wakes us up to Mercury's presence and is like a breath of fresh air from Montreaux.  It's a fitting start to an enjoyable experience.<br /><br />Yes, Made in Heaven contains a range of older tracks, but they're so well produced that they gel together quite well.  Unlike other post compilations like Led Zeppelin's CODA - Made in Heaven sounds like a band with an identity and a direction.  Songs like \\"I Was Born to Love You\\" - never a favourite of mine from Freddie's solo days - resonate well, and tracks from other releases - like \\"Heaven for Everyone\\" from Roger Taylor's band \\"The Cross\\" and Brian May's solo effort \\"Too Much Love will Kill You\\" are quite excellent.<br /><br />It's amazing how \\"undated\\" and integrated this album sounds considering its varied \\"sources.\\" The band was doing something right.  A masterful production and a worthy collection to a great band's legacy.<br /><br />True Music lies within this album.
0812975219|2.0|This is a very eclectic book.  It is not very well-written.  It is filled with self-congratulatory asides and anecdotes.  It rambles and seems to never get around to its major point -- that luck is more important than skill in creating opportunities.  I finished the book.  It took a long time.  I am not sure it was worth it.
0380789027|2.0|I read American Gods and Anansi Boys before I read this book. I looooved the novels, but I didn't care much for the short stories. I thought they were Stephen King-ish, although with less supernatural effects (and that's a good thing), but they just didn't do it for me.
0307387151|2.0|Blame it on the \\"Wall Street Journal.\\"  It ran an interesting story on Ian McEwen in November, peaking my interest in his books, \\"Atonement\\" in particular.    Flying home from a DC trip, I picked up a copy and started to read.  Two days later, my niece flew in from Phoenix.  She had purchased the book to read during her flight.    Upon her arrival, she said that based upon the first 100 pages, the book is miserable.  I laughed and agreed, but hoped things would pick up.      From a person fairly well read, but with no literary pretenses, there are two basic flaws with this book.  1)  It is overwritten.  There is a beauty to writing and a beauty to knowing when to stop.  (I wanted to skip pages.)  2)  The key character, Briony, is a miserable, unsympathetic, boring, narcissistic creature - even at the age of 13 when the book starts.    Late in the book, Briony makes reference to being the same person, even though she is old.  Indeed.  She is consistently painful from the first to the last page.    The book picked up some whenever the focus shifted from Briony, but this is her book.    There could be a similarity between Briony and the lead in Richard Ford's Independence Day - another book with similar shortcomings for the reader.  (And winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award).  John Casey's Spartina, winner of the National Book award, serves as an example of beautifully crafted literature.    In the Journal article, McEwen implies that a movie cannot capture the nuances of his book.  That could only be an endorsement of the movie.    My niece and I need to take better care in our book purchases at airports.

B0000AQS6R|4.0|This hysterical movie puts you right into the holiday spirit. It definately inspired my husband to decorate our house and begin feeling the holiday magic early in the season. This is his favorite Christmas movie. My only complaint is the packaging with the soft, cardboard cover. It should be packaged in a standard, plastic case. Otherwise, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a great addition to any collection. Looking forward to enjoying it for many  holidays ahead or as long as the packaging holds up!

B000XA5K4I|1.0|This is a very badly written fast paced movie. They types of things that they have clive owen doing is ridiculous. The Corny screen play just stays flowing throughout the entire movie. If you like really unbelievable scenarios that never end the way they should then you will love Shoot Em Up. I spent 30 dollars on the blu-ray and it was the worst movie purchase I made all year. Not even the Perfect picture of Blu-Ray could save THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!! DO NOT BUY

B000003NA4|5.0|\\"These songs are indeed about romance. But to me there is a broader and more personal attachment to each of the songs than the standard definition of romantic love might imply. I think that these songs represent the strength of love, including the love of family and friends.

Over the years, I've had the great pleasure of listening to some of the loveliest music courtesy of Diana Krall, who instantly became one of my favorite jazz artists after listening to one of her most remarkable and well-produced CDs, [[ASIN:B00000J7S8 When I Look in Your Eyes]], the only Diana Krall CD that won the Grammy awards for the \\"Best Jazz Vocal Performance\\" in 1999, and was nominated for \\"Album of the Year.\\" On the cover story of More Magazine, November 2007 issue written by Susan McClelland, she indicated that it was the \\"first time that a jazz singer has received such a nod since Ella Fitzgerald, 25 years earlier.\\" It's a fact, [[ASIN:B00000J7S8 When I Look in Your Eyes]] is truly the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me from all of her albums, and that nomination proved it.<br /><br />Her follow-up CD, [[ASIN:B00005N9CV The Look of Love]], recorded in 2001 is also my top favorite and sold 3.5 million copies. This album, \\"Love Scenes,\\" recorded in 1997 comes close to the aforementioned CDs in terms of beauty and appeal to the listeners. Both albums also received Grammy nominations.<br /><br />Although she doesn't have the embellishment of a full orchestra in this recording, she does justice to every song she artfully interprets with the backing of two of the most trusted names in jazz instrumentations whose chops are always flawless and spectacular - guitarist Russell Malone and bassist Christian McBride.<br /><br />Whether she's singing my all-time favorite gems \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me,\\" \\"You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me\\" and \\"How Deep Is The Ocean\\" or the less popular ones such as \\"I Miss You So,\\" \\"Gentle Rain\\" and \\"My Love Is,\\" she exudes confidence and lends elegance and sweet sophistication to each rendition to attain the album's theme of a warm musical romance.<br /><br />This CD is a winner and a keeper!

B0006J28KU|5.0|I think this might be my most favorite movie ever.  I can watch it again and again.  I love De Niro and Pacino not to mention Kilmer, Judd and all of the other actors.  John Voight is in this movie and I didn't even recognize him, at first.  Nonstop action from beginning to end.  You won't be disappointed!
0060555661|5.0|Congratulations! If you are thinking of buying this book, chances are that you are serious about the investing. If you are very new to investing then this book is not for you just yet. I would recommend you to read the books that warn you about the risks of stock picks and about the efficient market theory. You must enter in stock market with utmost caution and suspicion because ease of investment has somehow watered down the understanding of the risk involved in the stock market.    This book is written by the dean of value investment field. Now a days almost all money managers call themselves value investors but after reading this book you would be able to separate the wheat from the chaff. Many people have criticized the book to be archaic but they are probably the same people who heralded the dot com bubble as the dawn of the \\"new era\\".  The book is timeless and is as relevant today as it was in the past. Of course the book does not tell you about the fancy investment vehicles such as options and futures but what it tells you is the most important lesson in business not just in investing. It is the lesson of discipline and value. Ben Graham has shared his observation over several decades in the book. He goes on to show the cyclical nature of the economy and then demonstrates that disciplined approach to value investing with enough margin of safety is the only way of making money in stock market. It is easier said than done because with the intention of following the \\"buying low and selling high\\", most people end up doing exact the opposite. This is why Mr Graham said \\"The worst enemy of an investor is well, himself\\". This is where the discipline comes into the picture. Mr Graham goes on to show the consequences of not following the discipline. On a personal note, I have faced the consequences of not following the discipline.   In the end I would say if you have read this book once, you should read it once every year.    [...]
140130916X|4.0|This was an very enjoyable read. However, For me, it didn't quite reach the hype that was produced over it. The characters were vast and believable.  I could clearly picture someone in my life who related to almost every single one of them. I enjoyed the view into Irish culture and really loved the sense that all people, regardless of nationality, go through the same personal trials and emotions.  Being someone who has lost a love quickly and unexpectedly at a young age, I enjoyed being able to relate to so much of what Holly was going through.  There were moments when I wanted her to be stronger, but I guess there are moments when I wish I had been stonger too.  It keeps it real I suppose. It was frustrating to me the way Holly dealt with certain situations though.  Also, there were a few chapters that to me could have been skipped over and nothing would have been lost from the story.  The plot was creative and I read as quickly as possible to get from one of Gerry's cards to the next. The humorous parts of the book were perfectly balanced.  I don't think it's the best I've ever read, but I certainly recommend it if you just want a warm and entertaining story.
0307387151|4.0|ATONEMENT is a four-part book. It starts with thirteen-year-old Briony Tallis accusing Robbie Turner of raping her cousin. This part of the book is a little hard to believe. Robbie is enamored of Briony's sister, Cecelia. He sends her a love note, mistaking the edited version for a previous draft in which he used the \\"c\\" word. Ian McEwan then expects us to believe that Robbie would give the note to Briony to deliver. Briony is a willful little girl who lives sort of a fantasy life. She also has a crush on Robbie. Later, she catches her big sister and Robbie making love in the library. She perceives the lovemaking as an attack. Throw in a little class discrimination and you have a Jane Austin wannabe.<br /><br />After three-plus years in prison, we encounter Robbie once again as he winds his way towards Dunkirk after the French defeat in WWII. He is accompanied by two Cockney corporals who give him a bad time about his Cambridge degree. The corporals add a bit of comic relief to an otherwise brutal situation.<br /><br />In the third part, we find Briony Tallis working as a probationary nurse at a British hospital. One might compare Briony's situation to Marine Corps Boot Camp at Paris Island. Sister Marjorie Drummond, Briony's immediate superior, is a regular Nurse Ratchit. We also find Briony trying to make amends for what she did, hence the title. She's only eighteen but she confronts her sister and Robbie, who apparently survived Dunkirk.<br /><br />The final part of the book is so stunningly unexpected that it elevates the whole book one hundred percent. The book jumps ahead to 1999 and Briony is a seventy-seven-year old writer, suffering from dementia. We can also forgive some of McEwan's earlier liberties because of another revelation concerning the novel. Now, I'm going to have to watch the movie to see what they did to it. I know Cecelia probably plays a bigger part, since Keira Knightly plays her in the movie.
B000W4HJ44|4.0|I got the Original Broadway Soundtrack for Hairspray right after it came out, but wasn't able to see it on stage at that time.     So, I got very excited when I heard about the movie... and about the 2-disc DVD release. When I got it in the mail, I put the 2nd disc in my Mac, and it worked fine. Then, I wanted to see the movie... MY MAC WOULDN'T READ IT!     The short explanation can be found in the fine print(!) below the credits: (second line) \\" This DVD will not work in a CD-ROM drive, and the DVD-ROM features are not available on Apple Mac OS\\". Actually, it doesn't only count for the DVD-ROM features, but also for the whole DVD. And, not only are Mac users concerned, but Linux users, too.     When I finally got to view both DVDs (with Windows!!!!), it's worth every penny spent and every minute waited for its arrival. John Travolta gets funnier every time I see the movie. And Nikki Blonsky did a fabulous job as Tracy!
0375847227|5.0|I'm not really a fan of this genre, but after hearing all of the controversy about why we shouldn't allow our children to read the book or see the movie, I thought I'd find out the facts for myself.    Once I got into the first novel, I couldn't put it down.  I loved the entire story.  I enjoyed Pullman's writing style and looked forward to finding out what would happen next.  This is not a story that I will have my children read any time soon, but only because I don't think they will be fully able to follow the plot and appreciate the trilogy for a few more years.    It's not anti-God or anti-church as some have said (unless you worship a God who is a little old guy kept in a crystal box), but it does have a strong moral tale to tell.  Good vs. evil, keeping promises, betrayals, loyalty, courage - all are present in this story.      I want to see the film version of the Golden Compass, but I am also a little worried about doing so - I fear that the film adaptation will never live up to the written version, and I will end up disappointed.
B000VBIEXS|3.0|I was a FM Rock Radio Programer when this album was released.  I was a free-form FM \\"Underground\\" Rock D.J. when The Nice were supposedly a big deal.  I never got Keith Emerson, but in the process of beginning to review product for Amazon (is this a come-on to get me to buy more stuff?) I did a little research on Keith.    FIRST:  If you like The Nice, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, this is a great package.  If you're like me, maybe there's a Greatest Hits compilation that'd include Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression - Part 2 and, if you're lucky, I Believe In Father Christmas, another highpoint in ELP's career.    SECOND:  My problem with Keith Emerson is that he plays too well, and that his source material in his earlier days were composers I don't like. His inspirations were Bartok, Mussorgsky and Stravinsky, where Mick Jagger and Keith Richard's inspirations include Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley.    So, aside from welcoming back \\"my friends, to the show that never ends\\" (Karn Evil 9: 1st Impresson, Part 2) I don't like this.  I'd heard much of it before:  actually it was my job to listen to it (but I didn't like it then either.)  Since the release of Brain Salad Surgery, I've learned that I don't like Bartok, and Stravinsky puts me in a film noir mindset.  Just like the very talented and accomplished Keith Emerson.  Classical Jazz Rock Fusion is too complex for me, no matter how gifted the performer.    And I've liked Howlin' Wolf, Albert King, Chuck Berry, Ray Charles, B.B. King, Stevie Wonder, even Washboard Sam and Cab Calloway -- and still do like them, where Bartok and ELP lose my attention.  Different strokes...    Good package, extra tracks, if you were 18 when this came out in the early 70s it might unlock some youthful nostalgia.  95% of this album has NOT been on American Commercial radio for at least 25 years, but that's another story with many more victims than Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Arnold Palmer (old radio joke).
B00070Q7VO|4.0|This is by far Michael Buble's best effort.  The songs are produced beautifully and the vocals are top-notch.
B00006AW2G|5.0|What kind of idiot would review this?  Brilliance, first on vynil, then on CD, and now on a CD that's maybe, too clear.  All tracks are highpoints in the Rock Genre, which we should realize now means Popular Music.  Probably some of the best music to come out of the 2nd half of the 20th Century.     There was a point in time where many CDs were not in release in the US, but were in Great Britain.  There was a store in NYC that sold these imports, and I almost broke a finger grabbing for my first copy of \\"Let It Bleed\\".  And paid many dollars to the store owner.     Some yutz in the mastering process had obviously put in the leader tape that goes between cuts when mastering the tapes for CD.  And, this clever person had put the leader BEFORE the tracks.  So, you'd set the CD player to play \\"Live With Me\\" and there'd be a pause, about as long as the space between cuts.  I actually made a copy w/o the pauses, CD player to CD Recorder, but...     Here's the fix-it to several worn out copies of the vynil release, the weird early CD import... all those problems.  Finally, I got what I want and what I need.     And when was the last time you heard \\"You've Got The Silver\\", \\"Love In Vain\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\" or \\"Monkey Man\\" on the radio?
B000YPUF9W|3.0|Ok so this wasnt my favorite addition to the collection but I liked it none the less. Its a little less action packed as the last two. It has its slow/quiet moments. I like it because, as crazy as it is, you get some more background and info about the main character. BUT what I liked the most besides the great graphics and make up was that they are trying to be different. Lets face it you can only tell a zombie movie so many ways and I like the fact that they arent sticking to the whole creepy mansion or abandoned buidling thing. If you are a fan I think you will appreciate what they have done whether or not it hit the 'scary' mark. I have a feeling that we will see them in a much different environment in the next movie (Alaska?). I like the fact they are changing it up a bit. I love Mia and overall the movie was pretty good. If you are a Resident Evil or zombie movie fan you will like this movie.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I found this film MUCH better than I initally expected.  Loved the story plot, the unexpected twists, and of course the PIXAR animation was awesome as always!! I highly recommend this movie to those looking for a safe, fun, entertaining film the entire family can enjoy!!  I have seen it twice now...and am now buying it so I can add it to my collection.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is one of the most imaginative, and creative shows I have seen in a while.  I love this show, I love Michael C Hall as Dexter, and everything about this show.  The pacing, the acting, the writing, music, everything, nothing is bad about this show.<br /><br />I watched Season 1 as it aired on TV (I read Jeff's book first, then again at the end of the season)  And they match each other well.  I was lucky to watch this in HD, but I was growing impatient to watch this show again (as I deleted them from my TiVo).  When the dvds came out, I watched the whole set again.  Just recently, I watched the dvds again, followed by watching season 2 off my TiVo.<br /><br />Season 1 follows the book, not exactly, but to an extent.  It makes a great first season.  I fell in love with this show at first airing.  Anyone I show this to, loves it.  I do not wish to spoil anything, just note, it does get better in season 2!  Also buffy fans should be happy to know Julie Benz plays a fantastic role in this show.<br /><br />I rate this show a 5, it may not be a 5, but my blind love for this show prevents me from finding any faults, it is that good.<br /><br />I rate the dvds a 3 out of 5 (thats being polite).<br /><br />The video quality on this show is about a 3.  Showtime / CBS / Paramount fail to realize this show is 50-60 minutes in length, and cram too many episodes on each disc.<br /><br />Audio 4 out of 5, as with all showtime / cbs / paramount dvds, the default audio is stereo, you need to change it to dolby digital.  Also, no subtitles, only closed captioning (great if you are watching this on a \\"tv\\", I'm using an HDTV \\"monitor\\" which has no closed captioning.<br /><br />Extras, 2 commentary's, one with cast, one with the producers, the one with the producers is really good, and you should check it out.  They also have a bonus feature, which covers how they use blood splatter in real cases, which is nice.  I give this a 3.5 out of 5.<br /><br />Season 2 follows its on path, and tells a new original tale.  Hopefully this will continue with further seasons.  I eagerly await Season 3, and future books, you cannot go wrong with this.<br /><br />also, please make sure prior to starting to watch this, you alot the time available to view it in its entirety.  Especially if it is your first time, it is so addicting, you cannot step away from the TV, when this show aired on TV it drove me crazy, awaiting each week.  Trust me, it is THAT good.

0440418569|5.0|This is the last in the Pullman trilogy.  This was one of the most engaging stories I have ever read.  It includes a trip across the river Styxx and hard, Harry Potter-like choices for the children heroes of the story, as well as the adult heroes.  At every turn, massive sacrifices must be made.  The actions and emotions are intense.  If you fell in love with Will and Lyra in the previous books, you MUST finish the story.<br /><br />All the anti-church hoopla totally fizzles out altogether.  Rather than having things really connect up in the end about church, spirit, and humanity, I sort of got a bit lost.  There is closure for the main characters, but for me somehow the spiritual aspect did not get tied up like I thought it would.  I may have to read it again.  I found the whole series to be very relevant to our times, in this age of increasing integration of computers and the possibility of nano-bots and robotic surgery.  He also makes a great general point--just because you can do it, doesn't mean you should, with respect to scientific developments.  Pullman's work as a whole, though, was fantastic and very worthy of acclaim.  Enjoy.
B000P12LWY|4.0|When this show first aired on TV, I watched the first few episodes and enjoyed it, I decided to wait until the dvds came out to watch them all.<br /><br />The show itself, I give a 4 out of 5, it is a great show, amazing cast, fantastic cinematography, great writing (though, they could delve deeper at times) you really feel like you are there.<br /><br />Video a 4 out of 5 (best video a showtime dvd has been in ages, read below for more information on that)<br /><br />Extras 1 out of 5 (no deleted scenes, I think 1 commentary, 2 small 5 minute features, and one 22 minute feature that is nice, but not the kind of extra you would want from a series like this, couldn't you put an historical documentary on here about how the show contrasts with real life history?  Anything?  Also quit wasting precious DVD space with free episodes from other series, give us a trailer, or promo code to download, use that extra space for better video quality, and extras.  Or put the extra episodes on a bonus disc.<br /><br />Problems, these discs have closed captioning, but no subtitles, which would be ok if everyone had a TV with CC, I do not, why cant Paramount put subtitles on their dvds?<br /><br />All in all, this is a worthwhile purchase, a great show, runtime is slightly more than 9 hours, and a big step up from other showtime dvd releases, hopefully this is a glance of a work in progress of how things will be from now on (hopefully they will release blu-ray/hd-dvd releases, add subtitles, shoot more extras, have more commentaries, and put less episodes on each disc.<br /><br />For those who have viewed HBO's ROME, that is how this show should of been handled, they have a \\"road to rome\\" feature, which uses the subtitle track to show key historic information, not to mention they have several commentary's, very high video quality, loads of interesting extras (2+ hours).  When I watched that dvd, I learned a lot, when I watch this, I don't get the background information, I don't get the significance of what is going on, such as in ROME, when a character cursed someone with their left hand, the track shows why that is significant, which adds more authenticity to the production.<br /><br />you can skip this next part, it is just me ranting about what I hate about this companies dvds in more detail.<br /><br />Now onto my woes and concerns.  CBS/Paramount/Showtime have been releasing some tv show dvds with disastrous results, seemingly every release.  This is the first release (likely why it has a higher retail than others) that acknowledges, showtime TV shows run around 50-60 minutes in Length.  With that in mind, This is the first season in a long time to restrict each dvd to 3 episodes (disc 2 states it has 4 episodes, but it only has 3).  I hope the respective companies will continue to release future showtime dvd releases with only 3 episodes a disc (or go the HBO route, and show 2)  This is the first showtime release in some while to have such rich colors and vibrancy, however the video quality is still not what it should be, watch any other recent dvd (not from this company) and you will notice sharp detail, and high contrast, here you get a soft picture, but great contrast (odd, since this show was shot and aired in HD)<br /><br />I rate this a 4, only because the show is great, and you should buy this dvd.  My complaints are not with this show, I eagerly await season 2 (march) but these dvds do need more work. I appreciate showtime selling their series for such a low price (28 dollars for 9+ hours, is a very good price), but I want more extras, commentary's, and better video quality with subtitles (not closed captioning).e significance of what is going on, such as in ROME, when a character cursed someone with their left hand, the track shows why that is significant, which adds more authenticity to the production.<br /><br />you can skip this next part, it is just me ranting about what I hate about this companies dvds in more detail.<br /><br />Now onto my woes and concerns.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|Danny Boyle's latest foray into full-blown science fiction, Sunshine, lingers in the realm of horror at the most inappropriate times, and stifles the excitement at equally inopportune moments. Undoubtedly suspenseful, but with frenetic editing oftentimes replacing important scenes that shouldn't be so abstract, Sunshine may find itself fading all too quickly amongst the dregs of the genre. Amazing special effects and stunning visuals propel it to the top of the list of potential blockbusters, but mainstream audiences may be discouraged too quickly by the confused blend of themes and the uncertain motives behind Boyle's storyline decisions.<br /><br />In the future, the earth has been thrown into a nuclear winter from the sun's rapidly dying state. A group of scientists and astronauts aboard the Icarus Two are on a last ditch attempt to re-ignite the sun with a massive bomb - a mission that was failed by the previous team seven years earlier. When a distress signal from the Icarus One is picked up and the decision is made to intercept and investigate, tensions rise from critical calculation errors and dissension among the ranks. After a mysterious accident hinders the mission's progress and forces the crew to re-evaluate their situation, things take a turn for the worse as it appears someone or something doesn't want the operation to succeed.<br /><br />The beginning of Sunshine introduces unique and interesting characters, and their immediate development ensures that these will not be the static and forgettable lot from Michael Bay's Armageddon, which features a similarly unlikely plot and stereotypical heroes. But in the distant future, the crew of the Icarus is faced with the bleakness of unforgiving and lonely solitude from mankind, which has bestowed on these heroes the mission to save the world. A few early shots which weave through shadowy corridors and dance about dimly lit Giger-esque passageways immediately foreshadow ominous events. But the alarming intensity Boyle borrows from Ridley Scott's Alien is soon to be abandoned, as an overwhelming theme of self-sacrifice quickly permeates the ill-fated vessel. It keeps up quite adequately initially, with the crew continually faced with problems that insist upon sacrificing lives or weighing detrimental options. It is here that the character development and acting really grips the audience, with crew members greedily valuing their own lives above the betterment of humanity, or boldly volunteering for horribly suicidal missions. Chris Evans' Mace is perhaps the most influential and remarkable character of the crew, due to his unflinching dedication to the mission, which often leads to the realization that they are the last resort, last hope and final attempt at saving Earth. Cassie (Rose Byrne) displays the most relatable human qualities, refusing to give in to the idea that any one soul is less important than the entirety of humanity. Cillian Murphy's Capa is clearly the lead, but despite his powerful performance, oftentimes steps aside for the supporting casts' notable moments.<br /><br />Midway through the film, Boyle peaks with white-knuckle suspense and tear-jerker moments as his hapless crew is bombarded with issues of rapidly depleting oxygen, destruction to necessary ship components, and prioritizing the crew in the event that only a \\"lucky\\" few may see the mission through to its completion. When the decision is made to board Icarus One, the original ship sent some decade earlier, which was a supposed total failure, the eerie horror elements begin to take shape. Not a primitive form of scare tactics, but an inventive splicing of subliminal images, the editing warns of lingering atrocities that may still lurk in the lightless regions of the desolate craft. The creepiness remains, but is sadly underdeveloped, and gives way to obvious horror techniques that feel remarkably stereotypical. The sacrifices of the crew, the fear of death and the fear of failure all take a back seat to an outlandish nemesis that washes away the initial impressiveness of the already farfetched premise.<br /><br />As unbelievable as Boyle's plot appears, we are so perfectly soaked in its plausibility, from the characters, their emotions, and the situations that befall them. But like many of the quickly forgotten stabs at the vast science fiction genre, Sunshine introduces elements of shock that jarringly awake us from our comfortable suspension of disbelief and remove us from our sympathies for the protagonists. It becomes a game of who stays alive until the conclusion, instead of whether or not the mission succeeds. And the conclusion, possibly adding to the throwbacks to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with abstract images, corybantic editing and the computer that controls the well-being of the ship (with an appealing woman's voice), is too bizarre and unclear, leading to general dissatisfaction.<br /><br />Sunshine had plenty of potential, namely because the things that should have happened most certainly could have (although Boyle chose other routes), and is a welcome addition to 2007's lack of serious and mature science fiction. Ultimately, however, Boyle's latest film never really knows what it wants to be. The acting truly shines and brilliantly realized characters help to counteract the spiraling storyline. Such involving personas keep the suspense high and the ennui low, but even state-of-the-art special effects and inventive editing can't quite keep the light burning bright enough when the film flickers into the heavily treaded horror genre and the realm of disbelief. Questionable denouement direction aside, Sunshine still remains an engaging sci-fi thriller with plenty of hard-hitting action and scares, but like looking directly into the sun for too long, the lasting impression that it leaves might just blur amongst the rest of the genre's misadventures.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinssh nemesis that washes away the initial impressiveness of the already farfetched premise.

B00125JP1C|2.0|After reading some reviews, here and elsewhere, it seems people either love this movie or hate it.    If you are expecting a serious movie of any sort you will be sorely disappointed and likely end up hating it.  If you are looking for mindless fun with A LOT of gun play in it, you will probably love it.  Think of this movie as more of a spoof of other movies than anything else.      The effects and one liners are so far over the top, it had to be done completely on purpose.  I personally laughed most of the way through the movie and enjoyed the special effects and overall had an enjoyable experience that was definitely worth the rental fee.  I've rented movies before where I wanted my money back, and this is not one of them.      The friend that watched the movie with me is usually less critical of movies than I am, yet he said it is \\"the worst movie he has ever seen\\".  But, I believe he went in with expectations and seeing \\"Rambo\\".  This movie lies more towards the spoof of Rambo called, I believe, \\"Hot Shots\\", though the body count and gun fire in this movie, on that merit alone, will make any Rambo fan happy.    So, he gives it 1 star as the worst possible movie.  I gave it a 3 as enjoyable and since we both contributed to this review, I am giving it the average, of 2 stars.
B00007G1ZC|2.0|This anthology of short films by the great director Akira Kurosawa based on his dreams reveals a deep concern for the relationship between man and nature.  As one would expect, there are many extraordinary visuals on display here.  The first vignette, in which a young boy enters the forest on a rainy day in the hope of witnessing a wedding of foxes, begins the film beautifully.  It is startling, mysterious, and fearsome; the boy can be seen as a representative of all mankind, intruding thoughtlessly on the natural world without care for the consequences...and unprepared for those consequences when they come.  Unfortunately, while the quality of the visuals remains high, the stories become increasingly preachy and obvious as the film wears on.  Only one, concerning a group of mountain explorers that has lost the base camp, approaches the quality of that stunning first episode.
0439882826|5.0|What a beautiful and entertaining book. As a Sabuda fan, I never fail to be amazed and enthralled by the artistry of this art form.Reinhart is a master in the same vein. This was a gift for my 35 year old husband, who loves all the info on the characters (especially some \\"rarer\\" ones) as well as the unique and different format than many books on the subject. And the suprise on the last page of the light up lightsabers made my 6 year old gasp \\"that is SO COOL!!!\\"    A great gift for the fan that has it all.
B000BM3ZUE|5.0|Excellent! Although GG self-titled was perfect, this beats it by a mile. More complex. No traces of blues, except in Gary Greens' guitar work. Great use of mideval instruments like recorders and clavicord, and as aways, good intricate vocal harmonies. This is must-have. 5 stars
B000JJJF4O|3.0|When I initially rented this, it was under the assumption that this was going to be a hilarious comedy movie (typical of Adam Sandler).  However, the movie is actually quite serious with little bits of comedy strewn throughout.  It was a good movie to watch if you want a film with a somewhat serious plot; however, if you want a comedy, then I would recommend one of Adam's older films.
0553582038|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book since I was (am!) a big fan of the first 3 books of this series.    But it was just so...shockingly boring.  I could hardly get through it.  But I stuck with it because I kept hoping something interesting would *eventually* happen.  Perhaps a character I cared about would arrive on the scene...or something (anything) would HAPPEN.    But no.  Nothing but whiney characters moping around in the mud.  After awhile I just hoped that they would all die of some horrible disease so that we could move on to something interesting.  But no.  They kept on living, and walking, and living, and walking.  And living, and walking SOME MORE.  Bleah!    George R.R. Martin should also really consider hiring a good editor.  I think his books could be so much better for it.  Right now it seems that he suffers from diarrhea of the typewriter.    Oh, and one final note - Mr. Martin should be fined for each and every use of the word \\"tummy\\" in a non-children's book.  Thanks.
B00125JP1C|1.0|This is far and away the worst movie I've seen in a while.  It is rambling, cheesy, tasteless and stupid.  It took itself too seriously to even be a mockable favorite.  Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti must have some serious mortgages to pay...
1932073221|4.0|This is not a \\"how to\\" book on getting rich. It is a compendium<br />of personal behaviors which are conditions precedent to<br />acquiring wealth. This book addresses the psychosocial aspects<br />of becoming rich. Nevertheless, we should never lose<br />the focus on the spiritual side of life in the pursuit<br />of money or financial security.<br /><br />People do matter more than mere money itself. For<br />instance, the author asks that we relax and visualize<br />the process leading to great wealth and also general<br />contentment and well being in living life itself.<br /><br />We are encouraged to radiate self-esteem to help attract<br />money. A good deal of planning precedes wealth acquisition<br />so that we have a methodology for reaching our goals logically.<br />While following our goals toward wealth or financial security,<br />we should never lose sight of the spiritual side of life or<br />the need to help the community at large.<br /><br />Great resistance could indicate that we are reaching for<br />something \\"out of reach\\" or \\"the wrong thing\\" or \\"going about<br />it wrong\\" . The author asks that we imagine what success feels<br />like holistically and by extension- spiritually.<br /><br />In addition, the work equates value with<br />active doing or participation. Acquiring wealth is not a<br />static occupation- it is dynamic and evolutionary.<br />Sometimes wealth happens accidentally or by pure coincidence<br />of the right people being in the right place at the right<br />time.<br /><br />Overall, the presentation will help readers focus on a<br />methodology for becoming wealthy rather than an instant<br />gratification mechanism. The volume is directed toward<br />patient and goal-oriented readers. Readers should never<br />lose sight of the spiritual side in the pursuit of<br />wealth or financial security.

B00005JL3A|5.0|One of the best Action/Sci-Fi Movies to come out in a long time. There is still hope for the world of sci-fi. The length of the movie is good (personally I wish it could have been a little longer). Just the right amount of gore for the squeamish (could have been more).  I would recommend this movie to anyone, who are like-minded.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Having been a longtime fan of the original series, I was elated to hear that the BBC was reviving the brilliant world of \\"Doctor Who.\\"  I became even happier when SciFi Channel picked up the series and began broadcasting it here in the US.  This wonderful boxed set contains all thirteen of the original episodes in their entirety on four discs as well as a fifth disc containing an episode-by-episode \\"Doctor Who Confidential\\" hosted by \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" star, Simon Pegg.<br /><br />Each episode disc includes its own special features, with commentaries for all of the stories.  The highlights include an interview with Eccleston and the making of the destruction of Big Ben.  That particular extra reveals a fun secret to fans about London's famed clock during the taping of the sequence.<br /><br />The tales feature classic \\"Who\\" enemies like the Daleks and Autons as well as hints and nods to the classic series, including a glimpse at members of UNIT.  New enemies, like the wonderfully wicked Slitheen, also add to the mythos of \\"Who.\\"<br /><br />Christopher Eccleston, who comes across as very serious about his portrayal of the Doctor, plays the Timelord as an intense vigilante at times, a caring, loving friend at others, and then almost child-like when he encounters new experiences.  Loyal fans of the series have argued over who Eccleston's Doctor reminds them of the most.  Personally, I think that there's a healthy mix of Tom Baker's (#4) wonder and seriousness, William Hartnell's (#1) crankiness, and Peter Davison's (#5) sometimes emotional frailty.<br /><br />His companion this time around is Rose Tyler, played by Billie Piper.  She's a young Londoner fed up with her ho-hum life who jumps at the chance to go time-hopping with the Doctor.  She's a solid character who comes into her own as the series progresses.<br /><br />What makes this particular Doctor Who series so unique from the classic is the fact that victims, friends and enemies question the conscious of the Doctor.  Why is it that everywhere he turns up, people die?  Is he a selfish being, or a true hero?  Excellent characters like Jackie Tyler (Rose's mum) and Rose's boyfriend, the wonderful Mickey, are used as vehicles to drive these questions home.  Even the Daleks get a couple of ego-bruising shots at the Doctor.  The consequences of the actions of the Doctor and others are also addressed like they've never been looked at before in the classic series.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent revival of the classic series.  Gone are the wobbly sets and cheesy costumes, but the intelligent stories, scary enemies, and wonder and amazement are well-intact.  If you're new to the series, this is an excellent introduction.  If you're an old fan, you've probably already made up your mind about the show.<br /><br />Highly recommended.ns up, people die?  Is he a selfish being, or a true hero?

0312360266|1.0|marked,i thought was going to be a fun,cool vampire story but it turned out to be the other way around. theres no need to explain whats it about since there are million of reviews saying the plot.Zoey,the main character is a shallow,selfish girl and not at all likable.the book seems to be written by a teenage girl with anti-christian issues.thats my biggest concern it the book.every few chapters,they criticice chrisitian and calls us hypocrites. DO NOT LET UR CHILDREN BUY THIS BOOK and IF U R A CHRISTIAN DONT BUY THIS BOOK! i made a mistake buying it.  I never give books a bad review buy this is just plain bad! Theres this horrible scene where they r making a ritual to their goddess and they pain a 5 pointed star on their forehead and start doing a sermon and drinking wine like if making fun of the church or something,this books sucks,its horrible.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is abolutely the best movie I've seen in a long, long time.

Casting is perfect, and the dialogue is believable and funny.  Prett ymuch everything Ellen Page says will have you laughing, and Jennifer Garner's desperaion to have a child will tug at your heart.<br /><br />I'm probably preaching to the choir here.

B000TKW3E2|5.0|Dario Marianelli is becoming a composer of such high quality, that it is pure listening joy to hear the composer of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" now EXCEED that masterful work with his sweeping romantically lush soundtrack to ATONEMENT.To have the talent of French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet playing throughout a superior film is one thing,but to let the music simply stand alone for pure listening pleasure is the hallmark IMO of the superior film soundtrack.This is only one of two soundtracks that I feel worthy this year to purchase.Marianelli is heavy in the string department.His music puts a certain rhythm to the film and this swiftly paced soundtrack emulating typing and hurried footsteps is simply exciting.It is so easy to remember the film when I hear the soundtrack,but if I had heard the soundtrack first, then I WOULD have made a point to see the film.All in all,Marianelli is my man to which John Williams,Hans Zimmer,Howard Shore et al need to \\"pass the baton\\".  PAY WHAT YOU MUST! NOTE: this soundtrack WON THE GOLDEN GLOBE!!!!!!!!!
B000UR9T8C|1.0|Please believe me when I tell you that I am completely against the detention center in Guantanamo Bay...well for the most part. Whoever made the decision to cast the snivelling one-dimesional spent-Kleenex(R) Toby Maquire in the part of spiderman should be locked up. Really one should only have to glance at the title...Spider Man 3 to know what is in store. I honestly think Tom Hulce who played the part of Wolfgand (read Volfy) in the groundbreaking film Amadeus or even Richard Dreyfuss (thespiatus of Goodbye Girl repute) would have made a better spidey. I guess I should have said right up fron that I only lasted 7 minutes into the film. Instead of popcorn substitute soma for this one. More evidence that the Hollywood sausage factory is alive and well.

I had tried some vegan baking from another vegan cookbook, with very mediocre results. I ordered this book, and it is one of gems of my cooking library. These cupcakes are so delicious, you will wonder how you survived without them. I took a few batches to my office, and no one would believe that these were vegan cupcakes. I dare say that these are even better than cupcakes made with butter, eggs, etc.     The cookbook has great pictures, lots of variations to keep you amused, and is quite fun to read. Whether you are vegan or not, if you want to bake up some great cupcakes, give this cookbook a try. Delicious!    I also have her \\"Vegan with a Vengance\\" cookbook and the chocolate chocolate chip pancakes are the best I've ever had.
006112429X|5.0|This book is a look at what happens when people feel compelled to follow the great life's-script when they know deep down they shouldn't.  In a half-hearted push to meld with her husband's vision of apple pie, Eva is put in a place she never should have been and others suffered because of it.<br /><br />If anything, this book's driving message is that's it's okay to forego the picket fence.
0553103547|5.0|Very rarely do I rate books so highly!  This book, reminiscent of the fantasy style of a blend of Robert Jordan's narrative style and Frank Herbert's intrigues, is a masterful book full of twists.  There are no easy morals to glean from the book because all the characters stand out as realistic individuals whose hopes, ideas, and limited knowledge results in several dramatic twists.  Intrigue abounds!
006113399X|5.0|During World War II, Norway was occupied by the Nazi army, and the head of the government lent his name to the English language synonymous with traitor--Quisling.  About 400 Norwegian youths volunteered to fight with the Germans on the Eastern front against the Russians.  Most of them did not survive the war. But those that did and returned to Norway were branded traitors and sentenced to years in prison.<br /><br />It is against this challenging backdrop that the author has created a superb mystery novel equal to the best of the Scandinavian writers.  He introduces Harry Hole, an irreverent, alcoholic detective on a par with Harry Bosch and his contemporaries.  The story moves from events during the war to present times and back and forth.  A series of murders takes place in Oslo, and little by little Harry follows the leads subtly provided, ignoring the powers that be who tell him to ignore his intuition and \\"be a good boy.\\"<br /><br />The roots of the story are gleaned from the author's own background--his father served in the Leningrad siege and his mother in the resistance.  The novel was first published in Norway in 1997 and won the Glass Key Award for best Nordic crime novel and later voted the best Norwegian crime novel ever written.  It is the author's second book, and we look forward to many more.

Themes, concepts, genres, and ideas are spread across its tracks, which overlap and complement each other, constructing a whole which far exceeds the sum of its parts.  If a masterpiece upon canvas says a thousand words, then Clandestino is the audio manifestation of such a masterpiece.  Blended together are the sufferings and joys of humanity, expressed in multiple languages and held together by a unique poetry of musical fabric.  I cannot get enough of this album.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|\\"It may be arguably true that, in Jean-Paul Sartre's words, \\"hell is other people,\\" but what \\"The Lives of Others\\" brilliantly proves is that drama fits exactly the same definition.\\" Kenneth Turin<br /><br />1984, ring a bell? The years in Germany just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. We are taken on a ride like none other with  Capt. Gert Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a domestic surveillance specialist and interrogation expert who works for the Ministry for State Security. Professionally, he's identified only as HGW XX/7 working for Stasi. The time is grim, Capt. Wiesler dresses in gray, a trim jacket and pants, and lives a gray life. He is indoctrinated into the system and everything is for the State. The richness of life is missing, the State must know everything and your neighbors, your family may be spying on you.<br /><br />Capt Wielser is invited to a play by his superior, and he creates an interest in poet and playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). Wiselier takes an instant dislike to him and his girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), an actress in Dreyman's play. Soon Capt Wielser is involved in a plot to spy on the two. The Minister of Culture, or vulture in this case, has a sexual interest in Christa-Maria. Their apartment is bugged, and Capt Wiesler has taken a 12 hour shift to listen to everything that occurs. He finds a lot occurs and soon he is very interested in this couple. Some of what he finds he reports, the rest, well, Capt Wiesler becomes involved in their lives. His sense of identity becomes confused and the face of secrecy and the grayness seems to change.<br /><br />The score for 'The Lives of Others' is fabulous.  Gabriel Yared and his sometime orchestrator, St&eacute;phane Moucha write and play the score.  The score has delicate and luxurious melodies. Unfortunately, the score on the the CD of the same name is cut and is only thirty minutes, but it is still glorious. It matches each character and mood of the film and is haunting.<br /><br />The film has one of the most moving endings and as Peter Travis says,\\"It's an ending you don't see coming, yet it feels totally right. Von Donnersmarck, the first time Director, has crafted the best kind of movie: one you can't get out of your head.\\"<br /><br />This film won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film of 2006.

B00006IU73|5.0|This album was my first exposure to Steven Wilson's Porcupine Tree projects; and I have since become a tremendous fan, although I personally think he has yet to top this incredible album. I recently had a discussion with an older music industry vet who suggested that Tool and Porcupine tree are \\"the new generation's Pink Floyd\\", and I think that is a very accurate definition.<br /><br />For those who are new to Porcupine Tree, it is essentially a one-man project of multi-instrumentalist and musical genius Steven Wilson, and is best described as a modern alternative heavy rock style with significant '70s-era progressive rock influences (Roger Waters-esque social commentary, keyboards and mellotron, lengthy, complicated and melodic song structure, etc.) and at times a psychadelic vibe. This album is simply too good to be true, and a testament to this man's skill and talent.<br /><br />A concept album full of dark subject matter (narrating a story of childhood abuse and it's effect on the life of the main character), this album is deep, but can also be simply listened to and enjoyed without paying atttention to the story, the music is so melodic, well-written and engaging to the listener. There are moments on this disc that are almost heavier than anything Tool has done, yet alternated with beautiful, sublime interludes and passages with multiple vocal harmonies. The resulting effect is unsettling and compelling, and superb in it's skill and execution. One of the most stunning modern rock albums ever created, and with a nearly perfect production, since Wilson also happens to be a highly sought-after genius behind the mixing board. This album is right up there with Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" and Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" as a desert-island album.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|We've had our swivel sweeper for close to a year now so I feel ready to give an informed review on it. Our apartment is basically all hardwood floors and it was a pain to get out the vacuum, find places to plug it in and do the whole place with the suction tube--so we saw the swivel sweeper on TV and it looked like just what we needed. We found it cheap at the drug store and bought it there.    Overall, we're very happy with the purchase. Nothing has broken on it and we use it almost every other day. It's very light and quick to use whenever you see dirt or dust on the floor. On the hard floors, it works very well--even on the grout on the tiles for the most part. On the rugs however, it's not so good. Clearly the speed/power drops significantly when it's on anything other than a hard surface. It barely gets the job done and really kills the battery. We still use our vacuum on the rugs. And on the topic of the battery, we charge it overnight once every week and a half or so. We can vacuum our whole apartment (hardwood floors) 3-4 times on a charge (800 sq. ft.).     It's really easy to get under furniture and around table/bed legs with its swivel action, like it shows on TV. It does get in corners pretty well too, and picks things up in any direction. In the TV ad it says that it's quiet.. It's definitely NOT quiet. They clearly block out a lot of its noise in the ad and to use it around a sleeping baby is a joke. If that's your big selling point, don't buy it.    I highly recommend this product for people with lots of hard floors, who just want to keep the floor tidy all the time with a quick and simple sweeper. It's not going to do deep cleaning, but it's much easier than a broom or vacuum for all those in-between dirt and messes on the floor.
B000VR824S|5.0|As always, I read the previous reviews before posting mine. Again I am amazed that there were four meatheads who rated this show under three stars?<br /><br />I do agree with other critical reviews, that too many performers got so little time on the DVD and apparently live as well. Los Lobos does a full set and Johnny Winter gets to do Highway 61...and done? I had the privilege of seeing Johnny up close, six days before the festival in Omaha and he wowed the crowd, many of whom had never heard him before. To the reviewer who said, \\"Johnny was sick\\". Johnny is old and his eyesight is poor, that is why he has a \\"handler\\". He is no longer the showman that he was when he headed up the \\"AND\\" group with Derringer, but he still played lightning licks with or without the slide. I dare say that there were only a few who were on the show that day, who deserve to have their names mentioned in the same sentence as Winter.<br /><br />All things considered, this show was yet another blockbuster! Most importantly, the money that is being raised to benefit Clapton's Crossroads Centre at Antigua, will mean more people's lives might be spared from addiction. Isn't that the goal of these super-concerts?
B000Z9PYJS|5.0|I read this book several years ago and plan to buy the Kindle version.  I loved the story and the twist at the end.  Pi practiced Hindu, Christianity, and Islam.  He had all the bases covered as he drifted around the Pacific in a lifeboat with a huge Bengal tiger. Great read.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|I actually bought Is this it, then the 3rd strokes album years later, and then Room on fire. I had heard mixed reviews. What with the first album being a veritable greatest hits quality offering, the sophomore effort needed to be a slump? No way.<br /><br />This CD can be put on - just let it go; Song after good song; better and better guitar work and a bit more depth and richer production than the  first album. Just a more naturally produced effort, less \\"stylized.\\" Not just transistor and rythm- if you like the Strokes or any garage style rock- Why don't you already own this?
0689865384|3.0|I really liked the Uglies book.  I think it's so wonderful of a message to give our vain society. I read though the book quickly until the end. I thought it beat around the point of what I suspected was coming; Tally turning Pretty. Honestly I didn't read the last 20 pages or so, it got into too much action sequences without really moving forward. I think the author could have just shorten it and really given a power-punch ending.  I have the next book, the Pretties and still think Scott Westerfeld is a talented writer!
0975991477|2.0|I have always had an enormous interest in Genetics and was thrilled when I had the opprotunity to read this book. At the beginning of the book Dr. Lipton delves into academic research and then tries to challenge biology by saying \\"genes and DNA do not control our biology; that instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell\\". Which I failed to fully understand as that concept was the basis for Darwin's Orgin of the Species. It's well known that biological lifeforms adapt to their evironment and the concept is not revolutionary.    Sadly, Dr. Lipton's jump into New Age healing concepts prevented me from confirming that 'signals from outside a cell controls it's biology' was the basis for the book. This book was a complete disappointment but may be appriciated by those have an interest in the New Age Ideals.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|A lot of reviewers claim that this season lags terribly in the beginning, but picks up later. I have to disagree. I think that feeling must be an artifact of having watched it when it aired on TV. I understand that ABC made some bad airing decisions on this one that frustrated many people.    As with many recent shows (24, Alias, Battlestar Galactica), I waited for a couple of seasons to show up on DVD and then watched them from the beginning - on my own schedule and without commercials.    Viewed in this way, I did not feel at all bad about the first part of this season. I can't add much that other reviewers haven't already covered. I just wanted to add to the discussion that if you're watching the series on DVD (or thinking about it), you won't be disappointed with any part of season 3.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|This is not the best thing Mike Patton has done, but it grabs you on the first listen, rents headspace for days and is pretty darn hard to forget.  Songs are catchy, smooth, dangerous and near mystical in places.  But is it any good?<br /><br />I can understand that some people will be disappointed with this release.  At times it seems self-indulgent, but in a Randian way that benefits the listener.  At other times it seems confused by what it wants to be, but genre-bending is what Patton does best.  You can't argue with that.<br /><br />Parts R&B, parts industrial, parts world music, parts hip hop, parts metal.  It's a stew of styles that works wonders.  I bought it after seeing the band perform on \\"The Henry Rollins Show\\" and was hooked.  I don't buy music all that often (I get most of it free from labels), but this demanded I spend some scratch on it.  It will demand the same of you, and you'll be better off for it.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I have spent many weekends starting Friday evening and going through Sunday afternoon doing a \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" marathon. This is the best way to watch this series.  I've seen it at least ten times.  A marvelous resource and stinkin cheap right now on Amazon too.  Get it. Watch it. Share it.
055358894X|5.0|I'm a long time fantasy fan, and have been hearing about this book and this author for quite some time now on various internet discussion boards. I am really glad I finally made time to sit down and read it.    I really enjoyed the setting - a faux Middle Ages Venice built atop the ruins of an alien civilisation.    The book is about a precocious orphaned thief who is carefully trained to become a world class con man. Large parts of the book are in the form of flashbacks where we get to see that training take place.    Lynch has courage in writing a book about people - professional thieves (for whom thieving is an actual religion) - that some readers might not be sympathetic with. He also has the courage to kill/injure important characters when his story calls for it.    While I have a couple of small quibbles - one character is frequently referred to but never actually appears in the book despite her obvious importance to the other major characters - I thought that this book is a lot of fun in the way of a good heist movie or James Bond movie can be a lot of fun. Perhaps it lacks the depth some other major fantasy books/series have - but makes up for it in sheer enjoyment factor.
0783219695|5.0|After nearly 200 reviews posted for this film I'm not gonna say anything new probably, so let me encourage you to buy a copy of this DVD for your friends. I've watched this film over 50 times at least.  It made me want to get a better surround-sound system to experience it in even better quality - so I did!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|New analyses show that climate change is moving faster than anticipated by the reports in this movie.<br /><br />The award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize to Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, has brought some added publicity to the problem of global warming or climate change. You may read or download for yourself the IPCC summary report which is available on the IPCC dot ch web site. Alternatively, you may wish to just look out the window. The people of New Zealand have been able to see icebergs large enough for helicopter landings floating by within a few miles of their shores for the first time in recorded history.  Where I live, it seemed to take forever for our fall leaves to change color. We had a record warm October. The list of events that we see that have been predicted by climate scientists is seemingly without end.  According to the IPCC, before the end of this century, we may live in a world of elevated temperatures, rising sea level, and extreme weather.<br /><br />However, as dire as the predictions are, the reality is much worse.  The climate models are indeed inaccurate ... in their timing.  Climate change has accelerated beyond the predictions of only one or two years ago. In this movie, Al Gore states that the Arctic will be ice free in the summer in 40 years. That would put it about 2046. However, there have been news reports in the last month that NASA climate scientists are now predicting the summer of 2012 as the date for an ice-free Arctic. The ice in question is floating sea ice. Its melting will not raise the level of the world's oceans. However, an ice free Arctic Ocean will absorb more sunlight, increasing the Arctic warming trend. If the Arctic Ocean is ice free, can the collapse of the Greenland ice cap be far behind? There is enough ice on Greenland to raise the world's sea level by 15 to 20 feet should it melt or as it seems more likely flow into the ocean.<br /><br />The question used to be whether we will be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in time to save the planet for future generations. That is no longer the issue.  Can we now slow climate change enough so that we can enjoy the benefits of civilization, e.g. the Internet, HDTV, food, etc., through our own lifetimes?  In our town, we are working to get our local government to ratify the US Mayors Agreement on Climate Change to work toward the goal of reducing our Greenhouse gas emissions below our 1990 levels by the year 2012. This is a quite reasonable goal; change the light bulbs to CFLs, make buildings energy-efficient, drive low carbon footprint vehicles. We can all do this; save some money and maybe the planet too.<br /><br />I also recommend the books \\"[[ASIN:0807085766 With Speed and Violence: Why Scientists Fear Tipping Points in Climate Change]]\\", about recent scientific investigations and their implications for global warming, and [[ASIN:0762108762 Global Warning: The Last Chance for Change]], which details the politics of climate change.e gas emissions in time to save the planet for future generations.

B000R4SMCW|2.0|Sir Anthony Hopkins is brilliant.  Ryan Gosling is gorgeous and believable.  I love both of these actors, but...    \\"Fracture\\" didn't work, but went on and on and on...like paint drying, like something that could have been said and done and over with in 1/2 an hour.    After a while, one just doesn't care.  After 1 Hour, I was ready to scream, \\"So what!\\"   And after that... well the characters, content, dialouge, everything---was like something you just wanted to END.    The problem was...these actors were much bigger than the movie, but in closing, they couldn't even make it worthwhile or less painful.
B0002Y69NG|1.0|Years after these movies were made I succumbed to pressure from friends to watch them over the course of a weekend.  I admit to having come to the three movies in this collection with prejudice as they are precisely the kind of empty Hollywood drivel I choose normally to avoid, just as I avoid greasy hamburgers and donuts and other unhealthy things.  But finally I sat down and inserted the disks one after another into my DVD player.<br /><br />It would be trite to say that all my worst suspicions were confirmed.  Trite, but sadly true - except these movies were far more tedious than I had expected.  They are the quintessential Hollywood fare: banal script, characterless protagonists, and hundreds of millions of dollars spent on dressing up the whole sorry affair with special effects that serve only to demonstrate a complete lack of imagination.  Even the adolescent males for whom this kind of thing is intended ought really to have more discernment than to waste 6 hours of their lives sitting through this dross.  But of course they don't, and that's why movies like those in this collection are more than just an empty waste of money.  Movies like these, in which bullets fly and people's lives are snuffed out without a moment's thought and in which the correct choice of sunglasses is more important than trying to think about whether a human life is actually more significant than a fashion statement, lead directly to Columbine.<br /><br />Of course the Hollywood types who make a fortune peddeling filth like this will argue that \\"it's only entertainment,\\" just as the fast-food types argue that \\"it's only a cheeseburger, it's only a donut.\\"  Surely America's obesity epidemic can't have anything at all to do with the fact that Americans cram junk into themselves because it's everywhere around them?  And equally surely, all those school and mall and church shootings can't have anything to do with movies like the Matrix series?  Surely it's just sheer coincidence that alienated little boys who can't get the girl and can't get the grades but who can (god bless America) get the coat, the sunglasses and the gun, stroll blithely into crowded areas and then proceed to live out the violent fantasies that movies like the Matrix series inculcate within their unprepared minds?<br /><br />Oh yes, just coincidence.  So sit back, stuff some more popcorn and candy into your gaping mouth, switch off your critical faculties and thrust the DVD into the player.  But be sure to keep that leather coat, those designer sunglasses, and your choice of assault rifle close to hand...who can't get the girl and can't get the grades but who can (god bless America) get the coat, the sunglasses and the gun, stroll blithely into crowded areas and then proceed to live out the violent fantasies that movies like the Matrix series inculcate within their unprepared minds?

0316067598|5.0|This is a fantastic read! Well written, full of emotional impact and action.   It is a 'from the heart' account of an event that will long be remembered in the minds of most Americans. It is truly a tribute to men of action, courage and bravery. You will find it hard to put down.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I got this album the day it came out, and I'm still trying to like it. I have been a fan of tool since I was a child and first heard Sober on the radio and was freaked out by the video on MTV. Since then I have purchased every album (in chronological order so I could see how the band evolved). If the \\"hard\\" songs on opiate, undertow, and aenima are your favorite tool songs ever, and if you also have a Godsmack, or three days grace album, you will probably not like this album much like most people who like rock music didn't really care for lateralus. Each and Every tool album is, without sounding philosophical, a release of each band members emotions. Each and Every tool album is very taxing on the members to create and to play, the members have stated this many times in interviews. And Each and Every tool album has been filled with lyrics that have multiple meanings to different people, everything from a song being about heroin to that same song being about jesus. This album, lyrically, as a tool album, is one of if not worst by maynard. Vicarious is a song about violence on TV, thats it. I cannot see how there could be an argument otherwise. It is reminiscent of Stinkfist which is arguably about being desensitised by the media (most widely accepted theory), but lacks the \\"laugh in your face cause you think I'm serious humor\\" and ability for the lyrics to be interpreted otherwise. Musically vicarious is fantastic. Jambi starts off with a great riff (kinda like schism), but seemingly goes absolutely no where but an \\"annoying the third time around\\" peter frampton-ish guitar solo. There is absolutely no climax to this song, just a great begining and a great end. Lyrically Maynard dips back into his secret meanings and widely open to interpretation lyrics, for a little. There is just something lacking about them, especially the part where he repeats I wanna wish it all away. In the past maynard has never expressed something like that so simply, there has always been some more poetic lyric. Even on undertow, one of tool's most angry albums, he never really says something like I just want to yell at you, or any similar lyric which would be better suited in some crappy band like nicklebacks vocabulary. Wings for marie pt1 and 2 are good songs. They are lateralus-ish in that they last long and are more abient than previous songs. Both songs are some what anticlimatic as well. Pt. 1 has what sounds to be a great riff to lead into a more agressive melody, but it quickly disappears and the song goes back to being melencoly (maybe it's like maynard's emotions at the time...I dunno), but I can appreciate a good soft emotional song. Pt. 2 builds and builds and builds, and just when you think he's gonna let rip, there is a lack luster guitar solo that to me is kind of annoying. Lyrically I understand maynard wanting to write a song like this, it just seems weird that in disgustipated on undertow he would have sheep baaing(?) while he talks like a reverend, he would write a song like Judith (I know its APC but still) he would comment about how people let religion stop them from being enlightend and then he would sing a song with lyrics that say fetch me the spirit the son and the father, tell them their pillar of faith has ascended. I mean I know his mother was religous, it just seems weird that he would sing about it this way when he has mocked it so much in the past. The pot... a feeble attempt at making a song like hooker with penis? Its a straight rock song that people who only really like tools harder songs will get behind, and some misinformed stoners will chant as an anthem. It really has nothing to do with weed (its about the pot calling the kettle black). The lyrics make no sense, probably to anyone but maynard. Kangaroo (as in kangaroo court I'm guessing) done hung the jury with the innocent. Not very emotional or controversal lyrics, it just seems like tool having a good time (which there is nothing wrong with). Radio play has justabout killed this song for me though. Maynard's singnig is different and I liked that, but even for one of tools harder songs it lacks in that special \\"unf\\" that cold and ugly, hooker with a penis, or ticks and leeches had. Lipan conjuring--- I know the lipans are native americans, and I think I read somewhere that they like peyotee. My only guess is that the character in lost keys and rosetta stone ate some bad peyotee and had a weird indian \\"nature\\" moment where he thought he was abducted. Otherwise this song has some other cryptic meaning for why it's there and we all will undoubtedly hit skip on our cd players when this track arrives. Lost keys (blame hoffman). Sounds like tool having fun again, especially in the title. This song and rosetta are more like a short story that would make an album just by themselves. Rosetta stone is entirely too drawn out (even when you compare it to third eye). I know maynard is into conspiricy theories and I guess he wanted to make a funny song about an alien abduction. I have absolutely no problem with long songs, but this one is about 5 minutes too long and would have been best if placed at the end of the album followed up by the closing track on lateralus. Intention is very much like disposition and to me is actually a good track. I like disposition so I have no problem with the minimalist feel to this song. It is weird to hear danny play an electric drum set that doesn't sound like his accoustic set, but it was still good. Right in two... I hate the lyrics to this song. It is hard to say that because I love every single song by tool. There has never been a track on any tool album but this one where I can say those lyrics suck. These lyrics do not capture the picture tool has been painting for so many years. Yes I know, bands mature yaddy yaddy yadda. But I mean c'mon. Angels on the sideline? How do you go from a song like eulogy or opiate to a song where it seems like your local church's youth group might sing it? I can seeAPC maybe playing music to this song because their last album, which was their worst, was kinda political and all that. These lyrics leave nothing to the imagination, and to me don't evoke any sense of inspiration or enlightenment which is the very thing maynard said he wants his music to do. I do enjoy the instrumental aspect of this song. It is a catchy riff, a little happy when compared to any other tool song, and it does have a climax that makes for a song that feels complete. This song is easily (and this includes the segments in between songs like (-) ions, and mantra, etc.) my least favorite song by tool Ever. I'm not sure that six years was long enough for tool when making this album. It feels like it was a forced effort and maynard might have had his mind in other places (wine making, puscifer, life in general) so that he was not able to go to that place inside of his mind that has spawned such great lyrics that to this day spark conversations over meanings and the emotions that they evoke. It is not tools job to impress me, obviously they are not and never have played music for anyone but themselves. That being said I feel dissapointed and let down by this album. Yet it was still better than almost everything else that was shat out when this album was released. I hope now that puscifer is kinda out of maynards system (I'm sorry but I really don't care for any of those songs) that he can focus, relax, and when they're all ready, construct another album (which I see as being the last one sadly, I just have a hunch) that is 10,000x better than this one. Like aenima +1. Everyone will have different opinions about this album and I'm not trying to say mine is better than yours, so thanks for hearing mine.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Just when I thought I would never hear anything new from these guys....along comes this new Long Road Out of Eden.  So they didn't write every song, but they have made the selections their own by singing them!  I would recommend this album to any \\"old\\" Eagles fan.  Top of their game for presentation, orchestration, and just being Eagles.  There aren't that many groups that can come back after such a long absense and be great, but this group can.....in SPADES.  Love them FOREVER...a fan from the beginning.
0525457585|5.0|My first experience with this treasure was through the film as a young child. The film is full of beautiful special effects and weird images (the crumbling Southern Oracle, the beautiful Ivory Tower, the cute/creepy Falcor) that imprinted my brain. Years later, in high school, I discovered that this was actually a German book by the son of a surrealist artist. After devouring the book, I realized that making this into a film was pretty ridiculous. It's like \\"dancing about architecture\\". Don't get me wrong, I love the film. But saying the book is better is beside the point. The medium is supposed to be a book. And this book is one of the most clever I've ever read, one of my absolute favorites of the fantasy genre because it is a treatise on the fantasy genre, while also being just a great tale. You're reading The Neverending Story, at the same time, Bastian (the main character) is reading The Neverending Story. In that story, Atreyu is fighting the Nothing that is destroying Fantastica because the Childlike Empress needs a new name from the human world. Through his adventures and journey, Atreyu brings Bastian into their world (*sigh*, the power of reading) to give her her new name. Bastian, now a character in The Neverending Story, must journey and adventure in order to grow and change, and eventually return to his world. Bastian risks being lost and escaping, rather than returning to his distant, heartbroken widower father. Full of extraordinary characters and unbelievably imaginative things, The Neverending Story is a perfect illustration of the inter-dependency of the real human world and that of our fantasy. One needs the other, and yet, it is a delicate balance. Too little, and we are empty and corrupted and powerless. Too much, and we lose ourselves in greed and selfishness and self-denial. Needless to say, this is a beautiful, ingenious, and insanely clever tale of the yin and yang of reality and fantasy. It's everything that I deeply love about the genre.The hardcover version of the book is not only a beautiful presentation, but it includes the differently colored text and illustrations at the beginning of each chapter.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|When Thankful came out I ran to the stores to pick up a copy.  Was extremely impressed of her on AI so when her debut album came out I had to get it.  I wasn't impressed with that album.  To cookie cutter and didn't shine her talent like I expected it to do.  Than Breakaway came out.  That's the Kelly I love.  Edgy, power voice.  When My December came out I was reluctant to buy it, but read reviews on  here and deceided to.  With all the hype of her writting her own songs and leaving her record label I wasn't sure what to expect.  My December is Edgy and that power voice shines through.  I actually like the idea of her writting her own music.  To me that is true talent.  Why do people critize her for the production of this album?  Brittany Spears (who does not sing well or have really any talent- only attractive and thats why she's where she is at- in my opinion) does it and everyone rants and raves how great she is.  Yes Kelly has a great voice and she should use it.  But I would rather her make an album a little different from Breakaway.  Who wants to buy a CD that sounds like her last one?  If your a Kelly fan buy it.  If you like pop/rock buy it.

0307387151|2.0|A talented writer--an awful story.  There is no doubt Mr. McEwan can write--some of his prose is magical. But how depressing to read a whole book about how a child's mistake ruins two lives. And how tedious to re-read the detailed events from so many points of view (especially from the mother--how many descriptions of her migraines did we really need?) I wish his editor had been a bit braver and done some cutting. But even if the poor editor had, I fear I still would have found the novel slow and pointlessly sad.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|1982 was a banner year for Speilberg, who has a production credit on \\"Poltergeist.\\" ET was released about a month after this fine ghost story, and both movies have withstood the test of time. Although the film was directed by Tobe Hooper, Speilberg's presence on the set is undeniable. Craig T. Nelson and Jobeth Williams play \\"yuppie\\" parents to three children. The youngest, played with cuteness by the late Heather O'Rourke, is abducted by a supernatuarl force and suspended into a \\"phantom zone\\" somewhere within the confines of the cursed house. The classic \\"They're here\\" became a well known tagline for the film. The cast is excellent, of course, but perhaps the best of the lot comes in the form of a creepy seer played by Zelda Rubenstein, whose shrilly, infantile voice provides enough goose bumps to last the duration of the film.<br /><br />Although I can not say that \\"Poltergeist\\" is genuinely terrifying, it is good fun with a spooky premise. I liked when Jobeth Williams plunged into the pool and the corpses began to surface, and there's a few touching moments, too, especially considering the unfortunate and premature deaths of two of the children in real life. The music is both whimiscal and eerie. This film also spawned two sequels, neither of which come close to entertaining viewers as this offering.
B000R4SMD6|4.0|As far as the plot is concerned, other reviewers have covered that.  I want to compliment Greg Hoblit, the director, for his final version.  I reviewed the deleted scenes and the alternative endings.  This director showed his above average skills by choosing NOT to use the \\"let's-spell-this-out-for-the-viewer\\" scenes.  Those who disliked his style may have preferred the alternative endings.  Those who need neither the cliche endings nor the lesser TV-copshow aspects will appreciate Hoblit's choice of scene options and endings.
0440419514|3.0|I just finished the trilogy and was moved enough by it to bother writing a review.    In short, the Golden Compass is an imaginative, unique and captivating story.  The Subtle Knife is not quite as good, but still engaging.  They both build to what you think will be a satisfying and well constructed conclusion in the third volume.   Unfortunately the Amber Spyglass doesn't deliver.    The series could have been great, but ends up being just mediocre.  Pullman brings up so many interesting concepts and vividly describes his world(s), you can't help being drawn in.  You become emotionally invested in Lyra and Will and can't wait to see how they are going to solve the ails of the universe(s).   I pulled a couple of all nighters on the first two books .. completely engrossed.    I can't say the same for the last book.  First, there were to many disjointed subplots .. some leading nowhere.   I found myself skipping chapters to have plot continuity and then going back and picking up subplots.  Character development seemed to have ceased and there were too many outstanding questions that were unanswered.   Like ...    Warning:  Spoilers    What happened in the end?   Did they really save the universe through love and sacrifice (and if so, aren't these Christian ideals leaking through a supposed Atheist outlook)?   It seemed like nothing changed.   The few characters that were still alive just packed up and went home.   Granted, the imposter god was disposed of (in a very anti-climatic way), but did it really change anything?    What was dust?  It's never explained.  I was hoping the whole Mulefa adventure would shed some light on dust since they seemed to honor and understand it, but that never amounts to anything.    And the Amber Spyglass itself was a trivial part of the story ... unlike the compass or the knife.    How did Mary play the serpent and how was Lyra the new Eve?  This could have been a facinating tale.   Instead, it was next to non-existent.  The closest I can gather, after re-reading and re-reading, is the Marzipan chapter where Mary told the kids of her own first love and how it influenced her decision to leave the church, setting the stage for Lyra and Will to make a similiar choice.  Is that it?  Rather lame.  Did I miss something?    What did Will and Lyra's deamons do when the kids went into the land of the dead?  Enquiring minds want to know.      What happened to Will's mom?  Who were those people after him?    If angels could deal with specters, why didn't they do it right from the beginning?    And the list goes on.      I was disappointed with Lyra and Will in the end.  You get to really like these kids because of their determination, resourcefullness, and spunk.  In the end they (and a lot of the characters) seem to fizzle out and become paper thin - no more than puppets to exact a contrived tragic end.  The Lyra and Will I know from the first two books would not have just dutifully accepted their plight.  They would have told that angel and witch to get bent .. then run off to figure out their own solution.  :-)   Also, aren't they still pre-teen?   Their character changes would have been more acceptable if they had aged a few years over the trilogy.     After a while, I wasn't sure if I was reading a fantasy book, a treatise on Religion, or a Harlequin romance novel.   I think it tried to do and be too many things and didn't succeed at any.       Overall, I give the Trilogy 3 stars for the first two books.  If the characters had been developed more, and the plots storyboarded better, the third book could have been great.   As it is, I felt the first two books were a big build up to a contrived ending in the third book that was hollow and completely devoid of any humor or hope.  It left me gloomy and empty ... not to mention annoyed I had spent a good part of my vacation reading it.
B00004YTXH|5.0|I'm never disappointed and this product contains many of my favorites from Morricone.  It is amazing!
B000Y7U98C|1.0|what garbage. Nevermind that the movie doesn't bother to explain the premise (i.e. why are we suddenly in dire need to \\"ignite the sun\\"?) there is absolutely NOO science and nowhere near a bare adequate amount of \\"fiction\\" in this. the actual plot is incomprehensible. as in... you are not going to \\"get it\\" EVER. there IS no plot. this is absolute garbage from start to finish. I didn't pay to see this and I STILL want my money back.  unacceptable. there ARE no characters. There IS no idea. There IS NO PLOT. just random bits of random 2010 & 2001 quasi-nods. really, its kinda an insult. like do those \\"hollywood\\" types really think that we (the public) are dumb enough to be amused by this? at all???
B00000AFHM|5.0|I completely disagree with the review below.  \\"The Boy With the Arab Strap\\" is one of my favorite Belle & Sebastian albums.  It was my first impression of Belle & Sebastian; it made a very strong one, too.  I believe it is one of their most ingenious albums.  Like all of Belle & Sebastian's albums, it takes a musically trained ear as well as an appreciation for style and meaning in music in order to appreciate and enjoy them.  Many of my favorite songs of all time are on this album: \\"Sleep Around the Clock,\\"  \\"It Could've Been a Brilliant Career,\\" and \\"Dirty Dream Number Two.\\"  Along with these songs, almost all the songs on this album have very touching meanings in their lyrics and innovative composition.  I have listened to this album dozens of times and each time I hear and appreciate something new within each song.  It is a must buy for any Belle & Sebastian fan.
B000RL4GS4|5.0|For the first time I heard Airbourne was the track Stand up for Rock n' Roll  in the video game NHL 08 ... I really loved this song in the game, it's one of my favourite and its intro is great as a mobile ringtone too :-)<br /><br />but anyway, I really enjoy Runnin' Wild album - really great classic music, but in very modern way
B0000C8WYB|5.0|This is a terrific album.  So much energy went into all of the songs.  It is something that you will listen to often if you are a fan of Mireille Mathieu.
B00005JPTI|4.0|Recently we went to see I Am Legend.<br /><br />Based on a novel which I believe is of the same name, it tells the tale of a military doctor who is one of the few survivors of a plague, which has wiped out most of humanity, and turned most of the rest of the population into a pack of ravenous but daylight-fearing zombies. The doctor's manic mission is to find a cure for plague. He is on his own, except for his trusted dog, left behind by his family when they fled New York.<br /><br />The doctor is played by Will Smith, and he has to carry most of the movie on his own. And carry it he does. He could have been manic or over-the-top, but he kept things reserved, showing the quiet warping of personality associated with imposed isolation for years.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect. The zombies are too McGuffin-like, and the film feels a little shorter than it should have been as a result. Nevertheless, the movie was enjoyable, and provided some good scares too.
B00008VPUP|4.0|Thank you, Amazon! My toddler broke his beloved VHS copy of Lion King. He was not a happy camper when I told him that Lion King had \\"gone bye-bye.\\" I was not happy camper when I realize that Lion King as out of print and could not be found anywhere. I ordered a replacement through Amazon, after finding it for a very reasonable price. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this version had an additional song that my little one loved.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the star of the most elaborate reality television show possible. His entire life, from birth, has been televised live for over thirty years. He lives in a small island community that is actually a giant stage established for his benefit by the show's creator, Christof. Truman has never known he is the subject of a show, he is not an actor, just an insurance salesman living his life. Every person he knows, on the other hand, is an actor and acting out a script. His mother, best friend, wife, co-workers, all of them are there for the show and nothing else. The problem is that Truman is getting island fever and wants to leave. He also begins to suspect that something is wrong and that things in his life are fake somehow. His \\"loved ones\\" try to reassure him, but he's determined to keep pushing.     The Truman Show challenged a lot of viewers in 1998 because Jim Carrey's presence seemed to promise a comedy similar to his most recent hit at the time, [[ASIN:0783235070 Liar Liar (Collector's Edition)]]. This is not a comedy, however, but a drama with a bit of humor to break the tension. If you can get over waiting for Carrey to really busy out the zaniness, then you'll appreciate both the movie and what may be the finest performance of his career. The humor is still there occasionally, but so is a vulnerability that he has rarely exhibited. The supporting cast also turned in strong performances, led by Ed Harris as the tyrannical Christof who regards Truman as his personal property. Noah Emmerich, as best friend Marlon, is also noteworthy as the warm-hearted best friend who isn't what he seems.     The Truman Show is not like any movie made before or since, and that alone makes it noteworthy. It was far ahead of its time in portraying the phenomenon now known as reality TV before even the first season of Survivor was a hit. It has a few funny moments, but mostly this is a story of a man who hungers for more in his life and feels trapped at every turn. It's Truman against the entire world he's trapped in and who among us has never felt a touch of that?
B000EHQ57Q|5.0|First of all, this album is a classic, powerful, full of deep songs and breathless melodies, one of the best albums of my personal collection.    It has different moods, each song can drive you to a particular moment in your life, and i am not making this out, for example, dawning is the day, is a song that will make you think of those days where you were trying to find your way through this huge maze that we call the world, the protest lyrics of \\"Questions\\", or the mixed emotions on the \\"Melancholy man\\", the cheerfull \\"It's up to you\\".    Without a question, this album is an excelent selection for any music, prog rock.., classic rock..., Moodies fan..
0375842381|5.0|In a visual world it is all too easy to let others take over your imagination. You accept other peoples' visions as your own. It is convenient, easy, saves your effort but in effect makes your creative abilities go first numb and then dead. This is a book which may help re-awaken what you might have forgotten ever having. Or what you never had, brought up in front of a TV screen.<br />It would be a spoiler to give out any hints about the content - anyway, it is too complex to be summed up in a review in any but a ridiculous way. The important part is that Pullman creates a whole new world in his book, a world at an angle to ours and he gives you a chance to join him in the trip this book is, imagining the world he describes. If the book had nothing more to offer (and it is hardly the case) this alone would make it a perfect choice.<br />I could never understand why Harry Potter became a world bestseller and Pullman lagged behind. Let's hope that the movie and general interest that follows will give Pullman the place he has always deserved.
B000JBXXZ4|2.0|I was excited when i first heard the single ANna Molly, i mean whats not to like.  But as soon as i listened to some of the other songs on the cd i was disapointed quickly.  I don't know what they were thinking putting out a really good single to get people to buy the album, than there is just a bunch of crap to disapoint people who bought?  I think some people just made a mistake letting all the crappy songs on a cd that people had to buy just for a bunch of disapointing songs.

B000002OZY|5.0|I just got this album and let me say it is one of the best i have heard.  I think it is great that Pete Townshend decided to write an opera.  All the songs are great and just flow the way all cds should go.  But since it is an opera it should flow in order.  Overature is a good song to start then just goes on after that.  In my opionion Christmas and the mirror song are my favorite by the way they sound.  Everyone is amazing weather it is Keith on the drums or John on bass or Roger on vocals or Pete on guitar or vocals it is just an amazing album that any who fan should own, or if you just love music from the 60's...GET IT you won't be disapointed
0061547832|5.0|EXCELLENT - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  Loved the brazen Trump attitude.  By the end of the book I was getting a little tired of Bill Zanker tooting his horn!
B000QEIORG|5.0|I think this is one of my favorite cds that i own.  It starts of good wiht Monkey Wrench which goes into Hey Johnney Park Then there is all the good stuff to My Hero then some alright stuff until you get tho my favorite song on the album Everlong, i think it is agreat song on an amazing album that could make history.
0307165485|3.0|Parents who grew up with Richard Scarry's books and who are nostalgic about his wonderful characters may be somewhat disappointed with this book. Some stories are taken from the delightful Richard Scarry's busy world (which appears to be now out of print and only available used on amazon for $124). Apart from these, the other stories are in a style which is very different from the Richard Scarry's books which I grew up with.<br />Until they come out with a reprint of Richard Scarry's Busy world, I would recommend \\"What do people do all day\\", or \\"Funniest storybook ever\\", where you can find all the familiar characters such as the cat family, lowly worm etc.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Before i even got this album i read the reviews for it, in which i learned about that it is protected.  After reading the first review i saw that it said to press down the shift key.  I actually have a zune so i didn't know if the same thing would happen, but either way i pressed down the shift key.  I was happy afterwards to know that the ripped trackds were fine and normal.  So i listened to the cd and it is really good.  I just got it in 2007 but i remember all the hype it was getting back in 2005 like having 24 hours of the foo on Mtv and all that.  And let me tell you all the hype is well diserved, In Your Honor is a great album.  The first cd which is all electric is good there is not one song that i don't like, it starts with in your honor, and goes into the 4 singles from the cd, then into some other amazing songs.  The second cd which is acoustic is just as good.  All the songs are good and fun to listen too, What if i do, miracle and all the others are great, you won't find a better foo fighters cd than this.
B000001ELP|3.0|I'm a big KISS fan (75-77 era) and although this isn't my fave record, it still has some good songs on it. The obvious rockers rule like \\"I\\" and \\"The Oath\\", but Ace (my fave) doesn't shine as much on this record . I've read that he was pretty bummed out on the direction KISS was taking on this record and I can see why. It's cheesy, the story is cheesy and it has a \\"Queen's Flash Gordon Soundtrack\\" feel to it in some ways. But honestly, i've always considered KISS \\"comic book rock\\" anyway, so this record is a nice Dungeons & Dragons rock attempt and so I like it for what it is.
B000000LZV|5.0|First of all, an embarrasing admission.  I stumbled onto the Minutemen just recently, thanks to an off the cuff comment by some poster in another forum.  Whoever you are, thank you, thank you, thank you.  Back in the early 80's I didn't have much time or income to explore the L.A. punk scene except for X (another great band by the way).  Thank God I didn't die before hearing the Minutemen.  Double Nickels on the Dime is without a doubt one of the best, if not THE best, rock and roll albums I have ever heard.    DNOTD sounds amazingly fresh even today.  In short, this is timeless music that can't be easily categorized.  The musicianship on this album is tops, the songwriting excellent, and while D. Boon may not have been the greatest singer, his singing is very effective on this album.   I can understand if you have been raised on radio, listening to formula rock all your life, that you won't get this album.  But if you have an open mind, and enjoy a variety of different music styles, then you can't help but be completely blown away by DNOTD.    At this point in my life, I have listened to thousands upon thousands of musical recordings in so many different genres.  I'm hard pressed to find anything that can best the Minutemen playing DNOTD.  Then, consider that this double album was produced for $1,100 in 1983/84.  $1,100?  That boggles the mind!!    I give this recording my highest possible recommendation.
B000W04S6U|5.0|Since I've absolutely loved the previous Halo CDs, I bought this and wasn't disappointed.  As with the others, this one is excellent. And it's not just for Halo fans - it sounds like a feature film soundtrack, so it can be enjoyed by anyone who likes this kind of music.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|This was a gift for my son-in-law and he was thrilled to receive it!  From the casing to the actual product, he kept showing it off to all present at our gathering!    Thank you!

B000VWYNNW|3.0|I'm being overly critical here but as someone who has long loved Led Zeppelin and long loved this 1976 release, I cannot STAND the edits made to many of the tunes by Jimmy Page and Kevin Shirley. In particular, No Quarter and Whole Lot of Love and Black Dog. There are painful edits here and yes I say, PAINFUL because you know there was more music the band played during their performance of these tunes and Page, the most anal-retentive musician of the bunch, can't help but chop out any bit he doesn't like and you're left with nothing but fragments of greatness. This release EASILY would have garnered 5 stars from me if Page had NOT committed these crimes against his own band's music.<br /><br />So, yes, the remastering job is stellar and the sound quality is excellent but the edits made by Page are particularly noticeable and painful and frankly take away from the jamming that this band was known for. If you are a hard-core Zep fan you will be disappointed and feel let down by Page even though he did include some new songs that weren't part of the original 1976 release. If this is your first time purchasing this soundtrack you will like it and you might not notice the edits.<br /><br />All in all, a good release but those edits cost it from being a great release. Jimmy Page is just too anal and it hurts the releases of the band's live music.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Wilco is another one of those bands that seems to be critically acclaimed and commercially ignored at the same time. At any rate, Jeff Tweedy and the rest of the band continue to deliver great stuff with Sky Blue Sky.<br /><br />Standouts include smooth tracks like \\"What Light\\", \\"Either Way\\" and the title track. The band also does well with funkier songs, as evidenced by \\"Shake It Off\\" (although it's not the most accessible). And while some listeners might say that \\"On and On and On\\" is aptly titled, I think it closes the album quite nicely.<br /><br />The only real misstep is \\"Hate It Here\\", which made me say just that. But Sky Blue Sky is still comforting music worth adding to your collection.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0743201140|4.0|Now, Discover Your Strengths is a book based on the premise that the traditional model of becoming better by fixing your weaknesses is incorrect.  Instead you would be better off finding out your greatest strengths and developing those to improve your performance.  And lucky you, the authors provide an online quiz meant to help you discover your personal strengths.      The book begins discussing successful individuals and what they have in common.  Generally people who make it to the top enjoy what they do, and they work in roles that emphasis their strengths rather than their weaknesses.  One example is Warren Buffet, who thrives on investing in simple, boring companies.  When tech companies were the top performers, he chose not to join in, since the complex products and aggressive accounting techniques were not his forte.      The authors introduce three requirements to develop strengths, which are covered through the book:  * Distinguishing natural talent from knowledge and skills. Knowledge comes in two flavors, factual and experimental, which can both be learned.  Skill is what organizes experimental knowledge, allowing you to make use of it.  Natural talent is what drives performance, but cannot be learned.  The main focus of the book is to discover and define your talents.    * Identify your dominant talents.  What activities do you pick up quickly?  What do you enjoy doing, and do you excel at?  The book continuously promotes the strengths finder profile, an online test that narrows down your five dominant talents.    * Find the proper language to describe your talents.  Language is focused on the negatives, rather than positives.  The book provides some excellent examples of how language leans to the negative.  People who are meticulous and orderly are called anal; people who can't wait to act are impatient or impulsive.  The strength finder profile turns this around by naming each strength, defining it, and giving an example of someone that exhibits it.Later chapters go on to discuss how to use the results of the strength finder, covering both individuals who would like to develop themselves, and managers who would like to use the results to build a better team.  Techniques for creating a strengths-based organization include finding ways to reward employees while keeping them in the roles that they excel in, as well as focusing on the results of a goal rather than the means used to get there.  Employees should be encouraged to use their talents to achieve goals, rather than forcing them to follow rigid routines.      While I enjoyed the book and felt that the premise was interesting, there is one problem that I feel overcomes the positives. The only way to access the profile test is to use a code present in the book. I borrowed the book from a friend, so the code had already been used. Without taking the strengths finder profile online, I was unable to accurately narrow down what my strengths are, making the later parts of the book less interesting.  If I really wanted to take the test I would have to purchase my own copy of the book.  I don't know if this was an oversight by the authors, or a scheme to sell more books.      Furthermore, there is an entire chapter covering strengths based management, which assumes every employee takes the strengths finder profile.  This of course would require every single one of them to buy the book.      Recommendation:     If you don't know your strengths, and would like to find out more about yourself, this is an excellent place to start.  This would also be a good book for managers.  Even without requiring employees to take the profile test, there are enough suggestions for improving effectiveness and increasing morale that it could be a useful tool for some, although some of the topics are broad and very generalized.    For non-managers who are already familiar with their strengths it may be less useful.  I feel like there is something missing, like examples on how to actually build on your strengths.  It might be that this information is covered in other books in the series, and eventually I would like to look into those too.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite movies....it was exquisitly conceived by Quentin. It has all the elements necessary to have you tied to your seat, and the punch lines and dark jokes will become classics. If you are a big fan of Quentin, you must see this movie. He wont dissapoint you!!
B000WTBMBK|5.0|Since releasing his self-titled, eponymous debut in 2006, Burial has continued to successfully raise the level of the UK's underground dubstep music scene. His debut found him being listed among many \\"Best of 2006\\" lists from critics and fans alike from all over the world... and his newest release \\"Untrue\\" seems to be following that same path - being cited among music staples such as Pitchfork Media, NME, and Wired as standing above the competition in 2007. But without the prestige accolades and praise from critics, this album is able to stand fully on its own as a near genius masterpiece from beginning to end.<br /><br />When one thinks of electronica music, it's typical to imagine all kinds of senseless bleeps and vocal effects that have no place or relevance. This is not the case at all with Burial's newest release. \\"Untrue\\" breathes of a long walk home among empty fog-laden streets. It is infused with a keen sense of loneliness and mystery that builds a world that is as desolate as it is intriguing. Vocal samples create a sense of distance and hang in the air like old conversations begging to be remembered. Each track transitions into the next seamlessly, creating an album that is best experienced when listened to in its entirety rather than skipping tracks... a rarity among most music nowadays.<br /><br />Another rarity among \\"Untrue\\" is its ability to draw emotion through simplcity, rather than suffocating the listener with ridiculous amounts of whining, vocal gymnastics, or metaphors. \\"Archangel,\\" a standout track on the album, constructs around vocals that simply yearn for one to \\"tell me I belong.\\" Building alongside heavy bass and the echoes of voices in the background, the track and album overall finds itself creating an atmosphere of haunting melodies that pierce the ears and continue playing long after the music has stopped. \\"Untrue\\" finds Burial doing what he does best... side-stepping heedless attitude and digging deep into the very psychological being of human nature, highlighting the feelings of isolation, bleekness, and curiosity that we try our best to keep tucked away.<br /><br />Containing a sort of emptiness that invites listeners to draw their own conclusions while navigating the fog of their own dreamscapes, \\"Untrue\\" provides an audio encounter that never gets old. Like lying in bed on a rainy night... if one listens close enough, there are always new sounds to be heard among the presence of the album. It's simplicity, restraint, and aching vulnerability easily make Burial's \\"Untrue\\" one of the most fulfilling releases of 2007.e, highlighting the feelings of isolation, bleekness, and curiosity that we try our best to keep tucked away.    Containing a sort of emptiness that invites listeners to draw their own conclusions while navigating the fog of their own dreamscapes, \\"Untrue\\" provides an audio encounter that never gets old.

B000VI70X6|5.0|I had seen some of Sharika's videos in VH1 and I must say this movie made at her concert is great, not only did she performed (sang, danced, played the guitar) but she also invited Alejandro Sanz and Wycleff to perform with her, it was a great concert, an even better movie.

B000P0J02E|2.0|I loved the trilogy overall.  Reviews of \\"At World's End\\" were disappointing, but I thought it was a good movie that ended the series well.  I really liked the first soundtrack, loved the second, but was disappointed with the third.  Some of the segments were too soft to hear well, others were too disjointed.  It seems like the score kept trying to rev up to an exciting and powerful climax, but fell short before achieving the effect that \\"Hello Beastie\\" pulled off in \\"Dead Man's Chest\\".  \\"Drink Up Me Hearties\\" almost works, but not quite...

B000001F9N|5.0|This classic album is worth listening for Donna Summer's disco fans, I really enjoyed it a lot.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I have all seven seasons of the show.  I loved the Gilmore girls (all three), and of course Luke, and all the others in the town. I wish they could have continued .... I think they could have been as big a classic as \\"I Love Lucy.\\" Maybe they could do a movie and get Luke and Lorelai married, pregnate and happy! Wouldn't that be lovely!

159562015X|1.0|While I agree that it is great to hone in on what your \\"natural\\" talents and strengths are, I disagree with the author that we can't do whatever we set our mind to do.  I believe the mind is a very powerful tool and if we have a goal that we set our mind to achieve but don't possess the \\"natural talent\\" for it, that we are still capable of accomplishing it.  This has been proven throughout history.  If we only spent time on \\"what we are good at\\" we are limiting ourselves from personal and professional development.
B000002U94|5.0|CD was brand New Factory Original. Exactly what we were looking for. Description said shipped December 14-17. I was expecting it in that time frame, not being shipped out during that time frame. Was sent out after the 17th and recieved the 22nd.    Great Product, Slow shipping. Would order again.
0316067598|5.0|This is what a real patriot looks and sounds like, not a cackling politician who claims they love this country.  Although the book is slow starting, it's tough to put down.  My wife could not believe I finished it is such a fast time (I usually have four or five reads in process at any given time). This is also service to one's country and the ideals for which it stands. It should be mandatory reading for all journalism students. The writer puts you in the middle of the action. If, while reading the account, you cannot feel the tension in trying to survive and what should be pure terror as bullets are flying, there may be some other serious issues you should be dealing with.  This book should only be handled by those who love the USA.  The heroism it recounts is profound and a testament to the SEALs (and real veterans)who serve.

This product is fantastic and also something that the entire family can watch together.  GREAT BUY!

And the material should hold up nicely with the hard bindings and the case.    The only downsides are the heaviness of the item and the lack of ease removing a binder.  The case could have been designed for easier access to the individual binder.    I got it for $67.50; well worth the money.
B0009NSDCK|5.0|This is one my favorite movies about war. The UMD is a excellent format for see movies. A good images, audio and a lot subtitles.
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This is a moving picture, in every sense of the word.  It's the sort of film that can move the viewer - and not only emotionally, but also in terms of moving a person to action.  Stellar performances, meticulous costuming and historical detail - the makers of this film do all those things right.  If I have any criticism, it's that it's a little slow-moving in places.  It also may be a little difficult for those unfamiliar with the historical background to make sense of the plot.  Skimming an encyclopedia article about the British abolitionist movement ahead of time could improve one's enjoyment of the film - just to become familiar with some of the names of key players.  This is in many ways an important film, precisely because this stirring story is too little-known today.  The abolition of slavery was that rarest of political occurrences: a popular movement to bring moral values to reform society - and a successful one, at that.  This film is a must-see.

B000X1Z0BU|3.0|As I sat through Once, I didn't really know how to take it. I could barely understand the leading lady's accent. I didn't really know where the story was going. At the end of the film, I was dissapointed. Was that it? Were they not going to consemate their love for each other? Did they love each other? Wait, the lead characters were never given a name?!     Maybe I was a little slow the night I watched it, but it took a little thinking afterwards to completely understand the movie, or at least take it the way that I did.      The story of Once can be summed up by saying that Guy meet Girl and they make music together. That's what it was the second after viewing, but an hour or so later, I realized that their love was shown. It was shown the only it could have been shown, and that was through the music they made together.       After it clicked for me, I smiled. John Carney has written a sort of forbidden love story using music. The interactions given by our leads, Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová, are near perfection. The whole vacuum bit had me sold for Girl.      In the end, the whole tone of the film left a bittersweet feeling. I felt for Guy and Girl. I felt for the lack of their love. They'll always have their music. And great, great music it is.

B000LXHK2C|5.0|I was with my wife's family on a weekend away, when her sister said, \\"OK! Everyone in the T-V room to watch a movie I loved!\\" That was it for me. I begged off saying I was engrossed in my book. Any recommendations from my sister-in-law have universally been in the \\"You must be kidding!\\" range. An hour later, I ambled into the room and watched the last hour of A good Year. Then I borrowed it and watched it again at least ten times!<br /><br />I could tell you the entire story and the film would not be spoiled. But I'll be good and only tell you a little here and there and let you savor it as it develops. Russell Crowe plays Maximillian as an adult and Freddy Highmore plays him as a lad in Provence when he spends summers with his uncle, Albert Finney. As a grown up, Max is a London Bond trader and he makes money. As a boy, you watch him develop into the man. There are women to tempt the uncle; girls to tempt the boy; Wine to enamor them both and France for them to truly love.<br /><br />So this is a love story. It tells of Max's boyhood in which he is too young to know love; his manhood when he is too wrapped in money to understand love; and his survival when love is revealed to him in all its manifestations.<br /><br />Is it funny? Yes. Is it a bit over the top? Not for me! Were all the actors and actresses great? Without question. Did everyone love this film? Not by a long shot. Why not? They viewed it at a moment in their lives when the idea of love could not take them by the hair and shake them and say, \\"Look you fool! This is what it's all about!\\"<br /><br />It is what it's all about and getting to that realization makes for a wonderful film.<br /><br />Almost the last paragraph, I promise~! Maximillian the boy is playing chess with his uncle on the verandah of the chateau in Provence. The uncle goes into the house to get a bottle of wine and two glasses (Young Maximillian is perhaps 12 at this juncture. As the uncle fiddles just inside the house with the wine, Max gets the cigar his uncle has been smoking and sticks it in his mouth. He checks his uncle out in the house and readjusts the board when he sees that the uncle is busy. But the uncle has seen this bit of chicanery! He comes out with the wine and says to Max, \\"Tell me, Max. Have I ever told you why I love wine? It is because when you put it in your mouth it always tells you the truth. It cannot lie.\\" And he goes on to elaborate on this theme. When he is through he asks: \\"Now Max. Now that I've told you why I love wine, is there anything you have to say to me?\\" Young Max looks at his uncle, smiles, moves a piece on the chess board and says, \\"Yes, uncle. Check mate!\\" And the uncle looks at him and the board and says, \\"You little sh_t!\\"<br /><br />There's more. Much more!moking and sticks it in his mouth.

In this season Carrie starts a serious relationship with a past fling, Charlotte has a surprisingly happy end to her marriage with Trey.  Miranda deals with motherhood and her feelings for Steve, and Samantha is Samantha as usual. This DVD is well worth the money.
0375831002|5.0|Anyone who loves books will love this one. As another reviewer has said, there's no need to go into the plot here as that is apparent by now, but those avid readers who habitually lose themselves in a book, can identify - at least in a small way - with the little girl who loses herself in books to escape hunger, poverty, death and the other hardships of war. She also uses books to not only feed her own soul but the souls of neighbors as they huddle in crowded bomb shelters, and the soul of the young Jewish man hidden in her foster parents' basement.    Although the book is narrated by death, many humorous moments keep the book from being too dark.    I recommend this for all teens and adults who enjoy history, books, and a good story on the ability of the human spirit to survive.

Telephone and surveillance chase. No murders committed by Jason. Madrid. Still looking for the source. No murders. Acquires Julia as his ally. Tangiers. Scooter chase. And the best chase in the movie--cat and mouse and pit bull by foot through passageways, through rooms, over walls, up stairs, on balcony railings, in a tiny bathroom. One kill. Had to be done.<br /><br />Jason Bourne is close now. New York. He has issued an ultimatum, not in words, but in a dogged and relentless chase for the truth. Bourne's quest is to go to the beginning, no matter what, to learn what made him a killer. He finds an ally in CIA leader Pam Landy, a truth-seeker herself. Julia smiles for the first time.<br /><br />And there you have it. A few simple words on paper and the action movie is summarized. Ya think? Where's the essence? Where's the heart-pounding, virtually non-stop action? Truly, the only lulls in the physical action allow for flashbacks and face-to-face revelations--themselves mental actions.<br /><br />The editing of the chases is perfectly executed with two standouts: the foot chase in Tangiers--action, still clip, action, cutaway, action, still clip, long shot, closeup--dizzying pictorials of tension, necessity, speed. The car chase in New York with Jason and an Asset is just short of insane--perhaps partially insane--all the while suggestive of the single-mindedness of Arnold's Terminator.<br /><br />\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" is at least as good as the first two in the series, perhaps the best. Initially left for dead in the first film, Jason is re-born in the ocean with tags of memory to become the  ultimatum by the third film.

Truly, Stalinism is alive and well in north Korea.
B000RK3JOC|5.0|John's second book is just as good as [[ASIN:0142402516 Looking for Alaska]]. John is a masterful storyteller. In my opinion a great storyteller is one that leaves you envisioning the story long after you put the book down and that is just whats happens with this story of loss, love, heart-ache and discovery. Here's hoping for a sequal to this one, he certainly left room for a second adventure for Colin Singleton.

B000VBJEEG|3.0|I have to say that in terms of visual quality, this is the most dazzling computer generated cartoon yet. But at the same time the film feels like a throwback to earlier computer animation, because it feels like the computer got in the way of good moviemaking. What good are photo-realistic backgrounds when character development is missing, and you're sitting there wondering if the movie will ever end?    The film keeps right on going past a perfectly reasonable ending and into what should have been the obligatory cheap straight-to-DVD sequel. This gives you plenty of time to squirm in your seat and think about how the way the lead rat controls the lead human is a metaphor for the completely-lacking rapport that should have developed between the two characters. It's all very mechanical and formulaic, and I'm left feeling that I don't give a rat's you-know-what about the whole thing.

Really fantastic songs!!!
0671775308|5.0|Over the years i have read this book about a dozen times.   I find this book incredibly inpsirational, and a very interesting and educational read.  For myself, it has changed the way my family has earned, saved and spend.  However, I don't aspire to be like the millionaires in this book.  Many of them don't actually enjoy the pleasures their money can earn.  This begs the question, whats the point of all this money.  Is money there just to be hoarded?  Or is money there just to be spend (which is what the authors argue against.)  Or could it be possible that the key to true financial happiness and wealth lies somwhere in the middle.  Not spending needlessly and being disciplined while at the same time enjoying the rich rewards your money can give you?  For ourselves, we (i believe) have been able to find the golden middle.  At the end of life its not about how much stuff you acumulate, or how much money you acumulate.  Its about how you spend your life, and how much you enjoy it.  So read this book, and find the balance for youself.

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|I was taken by surprise when I saw this film - I had read Steven Millhauser's short story, on which it is based, but had missed the film when it came out.  The film takes the bare bones of the short story and imposes upon them the intense childhood attachment between Eisenheim and his aristocratic neighbor, and the ensuing romance touching the core of the Hapsburg dynasty shortly before it and its empire go down to ruin.  Neither the childhood romance nor the rivalry with the Hapsburg heir appears in the short story.  I am usually outraged when original literary works receive such treatment by Hollywood.  However, in this case, I was rewarded with a lovely, romantic jewel of a film that works quite well on its own terms.  The script begs one or two narrative questions, but this is one of the rare cases in which these don't matter much, overall.  Contrary to the opinion expressed by a reviewer below, in my opinion the film is defined by the sense of hidden strength and longing with which Edward Norton imbues Eisenheim.  The broken childhood attachment that convinces him to follow his calling as a magician, and the later reunification with his lost love that this choice brings about, make for a very satisfying journey, indeed.  It is precisely Eisenheim's ability to hide his thoughts, his canny self-control, and his relationship to his magic (which is to say, his broader view of what is possible and what is not), and their ultimate triumph over blunt authority and the social order, that make the film so appealing.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is very good, as well, particularly Paul Giammati as the police inspector and Rufus Sewell as the unstable and vicious Crown Prince Leopold.  Jessica Biel is the weakest leak in this chain as Eisenham's (adult) love: her \\"Viennese\\" accent slips the most often, and she is not as charismatic as Norton, but she does well enough and doesn't spoil the movie.  The film is set in Vienna in 1910, and the American actors, as well as the British Sewell, were coached to produce a \\"Viennese\\" accent, but it isn't, quite, and the result among the Americans is an inconsistent sound that is neither British nor Viennese, and which Biel, in particular, had trouble maintaining.  There are a few narrative weakness.  One is the Duchess not recognizing Eisenham, the love of her youth, 15 years later as she stares into his eyes on stage - he was already an extraordinary young magician when she first knew him and already possessed of an adult voice. Then there is the little matter of the Duchess's exit, apparently with no questions from the noble family who presumably would have wished to bury her!  But these quibbles, somehow, are easily set aside in the somewhat fairy-tale-like atmosphere of the film, which was imaginatively shot in sepia tones that enhanced this.  This eerie atmosphere is also greatly enhanced by Philip Glass's delicate, mysterious score.  Romantics, rebels, and dreamers everywhere will appreciate the themes of this film as expressed through the relationships among the characters.  The magical effects, of course, are enhanced by the wonders of computer technology.  One is aware of this while watching, but doesn't care.<br /><br />A charming and romantic film with a truly unique feel to it, highly recommended.h Sewell, were coached to produce a \\"Viennese\\" accent, but it isn't, quite, and the result among the Americans is an inconsistent sound that is neither British nor Viennese, and which Biel, in particular, had trouble maintaining.

It is beautifully crafted. The plot is complex. It is a page-turner that you can easily stay up all night to read. The best part of the book is how the author lets you know lots of follow-up details about the secondary characters. You have a few questions at the end, but most of them are answered.

B00068NVI4|5.0|This DVD is really great.  South Side of the Sky and Ritual are both standouts and GREAT.    I was a bit disappointed in the guitar work on Starship Troopers and Yours is No Disgrace. I think I miss Steve's way out riffs on Yessongs. But otherwise Steve Howe was amazing.    Even Mind Drive performed twice on this DVD was really good and it is not one of my favorite Yes tunes.    If you like Yes you won't be disappointed.    UPDATE: I note that a lot of people are commenting on the sound. I suppose that would depend upon what system you are listening to this DVD on. I just had it hooked up to my old stereo and it sounded GREAT. So good in fact that I ripped it to my MP3 player where the tracks are among the best sounding of 10 or 15 gigs I have of live music of all kinds!    That being said I don't think there is any sound system anywhere that is going to be able to play the drum sections and sound like Yes in concert. Music systems are not capable of that, nor are mixers able to capture that full dynamic range.

B00000F169|3.0|I've enjoyed Dark Star for more than 25 years, and never fail to laugh in many places for example Pinback being stalked by an intelligent beachball alien. However, I've slowly learned that my friends and spouse who are less fascinated by the sci fi genre don't love it as much as I do, and never will. If only some real money could have been spent on this movie. It explores several dimensions of the future of space travel better than any other movie. Sublight space travel turns out to be boring, and dangerous. The greatest limitations are those of the human mind and the mechanical and cybernetic contrivances we create. Dispirited by the accidental death of their captain, and a long way from home, the mission of the Dark Star devolves from the search for intelligent life (which actually succeeded) to the destruction of rogue planets in unstable orbits. The HAL (before HAL) type computer has to be taught phenomenology to prevent it destroying the Dark Star. Within two minutes. And so it goes. In the end we are left with that aspect of humanity we brought into space with us in the firtst place, as memorialized in the catchy and apt song, \\"Benson Arizona.\\"    Its a cult classic and I'm proud to be a member of the cult.

First, Merchant's voice is unworldly.  Second, there are songs that are upbeat and some that are slow.  Third the aucoustic nature of the album allows Merchant's vocals to really shine through.  And lastly, this album has almost all of the best songs from the Natalie Merchant era of the 10,000 Maniacs.    If you are looking for a great album that will give you hours of listening pleasure, this one should be high on your list.

B0002WYS6S|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a gift for my son (18),  a Dream Theatre fan.  He loves this video and he is a discerning fan!  It was a great choice.
0679809015|5.0|This book is very durable and small enough for baby to hold himself. Excellent choice! (Makes an excellent stocking stuffer too.)
B00005JKHN|1.0|I had a suspicion when I saw this product that it was a pirated version, and once I received it, I'm pretty sure it is.  The quality of the dvd is poor...after the first viewing, it pixelates constantly in the beginning or just doesn't play at all.  I should have trusted my first instinct and not purchased this dvd, especially considering how much it cost.
0316067598|5.0|This book has a bit of a slow start, with training of the Marine Seals; but still very interesting and gets you hyped for the ensuing story which is the second half of the book. This reads very quickly and will be a book you hate to put down.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This season probably answers more questions than the other but it brings up just as many more questions to be answered.  It is jampacked with suspense.  If you haven't watched this show you need to start because it may be one of the greatest Television shows ever created.
0312330855|5.0|This compilation of many of the stories of this master storyteller is superb in every way.  I've met the man and one of the subjects of his experiences (in the story of the man with cattle).  James Alf Wight (real name of author)was famous in the vicinity of Thirsk for his stories. One of his customers told me that as a kid he couldn't wait for the annual visits as \\"Herriot regailed him and his family with stories the whole time.\\"  The book is a retelling of some of his stories - and entertaining in every way.  Super book!
B000WCDI64|4.0|This is a great dvd that depicts the singer perfect.  Great voice and way out there.  Highly recommend if you enjoy her music.
B00000I0XW|5.0|This album is very enjoyable. I knew some of the songs but also have enjoyed those that are new to me .  This CD provides an opportunity to hear the full range of Ms. Brightman's voice which is spectacular. Anyone who likes Ms. Brightman or sees many Broadway shows would like this collection.
1594489505|5.0|This was a great book. It wasn't quite like the first one but splendid nevertheless. The book has an equal depressing tone like \\"The Kite Runner\\" with all the abuse those people had to endure, but the storyline is very interesting. And you learn alot too!

B000WZAE1I|5.0|When I saw this in the theater I knew I wanted it in my library.  Totally entertaining.  The best science fiction/fantasy I have seen in a long time.  Robert De Niro was the best!  The story was fantastic and inventive.  The scenery was exquisite.  In all categories A+
B000Y7U98C|4.0|**** 2007. Directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland who was already responsible for the screenplays of [[ASIN:B000AXWWVM The Beach]] and [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]] also directed by Danny Boyle. A British science fiction movie is always fun to watch as though the recurrent and only theme handled by the few directors interested by this genre is the end of the world. Note the work on colors and the numerous associations eye/sun and enjoy this journey towards a dying star.
B000GH3CVQ|4.0|Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova make a real-life ending to the movie \\"once\\" with its satisfying but unresolved ending. They do the songs they liked, tart them up with excellent production values and add a few other tunes. Has a quieter, shinier feel than the movie soundtrack, sometimes a bit draggy. It almost comes out whole, but being part of a movie soundtrack and the rest added, it has a \\"parts of the sum\\" feeling. There are definitely some great tracks here if you want to just pick and choose. I wonder what's next for these two?

184195425X|5.0|Beyond a doubt, \\"Life of Pi\\" is the most stellar piece of named fiction I have read in several years.  In retrospect, I wonder how I ever spent four days reading Part I, when Part II went by in a single sitting.<br /><br />Yes, I believe the author had a hand in classifying this work as fiction, but I guarantee that creative readers everywhere will continue to harbor misgivings toward that designation.  The fact of the matter is, the author is such a master at connecting the necessary background from Part I to the incredible events rampant in Part II that, by the conclusion of the story, any on-the-edge thinkers will seriously be considering the wonders of our world yet undiscovered.<br /><br />The author's writing style is consistent and engaging throughout, but there is a marked difference between the divided sections of the book.  Part I seems to set up a \\"coming of age\\" archetype which is totally blown out of the water (no pun intended) in Part II.  Only when I closed the back cover did I realize how imperative it is for the reader to fully absorb the initial section in order to BELIEVE in the ensuing escapades of the concluding section.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the book ended. I have read copiously my whole life, and no other work readily comes to mind regarding a similar complaint.

I had also purchased the Ratatouille Cook Book which was lots of fun.
B000053TVR|5.0|What better way to usher in the new decade, century, AND millennium than by stirring up a little controversy? First, a little backstory, to properly explain the reason for the controversy. OK Computer (the best album of the '90s IMHO)was a huge success, spawning countless imitators and established Radiohead as 1997's entry for the Most Important Band in the World sweepstakes. So this was a highly anticipated album, with everyone expecting OK Computer, pt. 2.<br />Here's the issue: Radiohead did not want to deliver that. For some reason they've always been quite critical of their '90s work (sounds pretty good to me, though), and for whatever reason they felt they had hit a dead end. So they overcompensated, putting out an album that doesn't sound a thing like rock - not even rock in the broadest possible sense - at all. They decided on electronica. Now, this move wasn't completely unprecedented - U2 and the Smashing Pumpkins also entered that territory - but neither group went as far into it as Radiohead did and neither group had as much artistic success with the genre.<br />I'm told Kid A is a concept album about the first human clone. And while it's kind of hard to find a narrative thread in this album (indeed, it can be hard to simply comprehend the lyrics), it does have the feel of being one unified whole, rather than a collection of unrelated songs. It's pretty tough to sit down and listen to a single song from this album, other than the relatively radio-friendly \\"Optimistic\\" (a small hit), and get the full effect. Oh, these songs are still likeable enough as individual tracks, but to get the proper experience you have to listen to it as a full album. It helps put everything into context.<br />So, onto the songs! It starts off with one of my favorites, the heavily atmospheric \\"Everything in its Right Place\\", opening with an ominous electric piano motif and a hypnotic techno beat. This gives it a feeling of unrest, which is all unleashed later in the song when samples of Thom's voice floating from speaker to speaker. The pseudoclassical title track is even stranger, a downbeat piece with a \\"No Surprises\\"-like aura and Yorke's muffled, heavily distorted vocals. It's a great song, though, just not what you're used to hearing. Afterwards comes what may be the most infamous and controversial song on the album, \\"The National Anthem\\".  It's probably the most energetic song contained herein, kicking off with a fast, memorable bass vamp that could be seen as something near funk in a weird universe. So, nothing weird about that, right? I mean, bass vamps are a bit weird in the Radiohead universe, but... Oh, yeah, there's also the Charles Mingus-inspired free- jazz horn section. THAT'S what gets people incensed about the song. And it's one of my favorite moments on the album. And not just because I'm a jazz fan - those horns just come out of nowhere.<br />If I lost you at \\"free jazz horn section\\", you probably shouldn't even consider buying this album. Because there's more where that came from. No  more free jazz horns, but a lot of unabashed weirdness. None on \\"How to Disappear Completely\\", though, a quiet, gorgeous song that's one of the record's very best. \\"Treefingers\\", a quiet guitar solo, continues in that song's direction. Even fans of the album tend to be a bit leery of it, but I don't know - it's the weakest song on the album, but it's a great linking track just the same. You definitely can't listen to it independent of the album, but that's just a rule of this disc in the first place, and it's a sturdy bridge anyway.<br />So the second half is, like the first, on the strange side. But they don't launch immediately into the challenging stuff, instead offering up a really good semi-pop song, \\"Optimistic\\". The lyrics are quite cynical, offering a criticism of idealism, and it's Radiohead at their finest as songwriters. Then it's back to strange. \\"In Limbo\\", a fascinating, distant-sounding song, contains my favorite moment on the record: When Thom sings \\"I'm lost at sea...\\", the track goes INSANE, and ends up sounding like the soundtrack to the apocalypse. Keeping with that apocalyptic theme is \\"Idioteque\\", a twisted variant of a dance song about an ice age. Very good song there. Nice use of claustrophobic electronics. \\"Morning Bell\\" is also an unbeatable song, with Thom's creepy lyrics about a bitter divorce (\\"Cut the kids in half...\\", which has an octave-leap or so), 5/4 drumbeats, and a creepy organ. In keeping with the freakiness, the end of the song is a bunch of shrill, shrieking noises from a synthesizer. It's difficult to pick a favorite song on this album, but \\"Morning Bell\\" is up there.<br />And so is the climactic song, \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\". The narrator, who I think is Kid A, has lived a sorry life, addicted to sex and drugs and so forth. It's a depressing thought, but the music is beautiful, and we're treated with the sound of this character dying and going to heaven. Then, after a long pause, the music indicates that the hero is IN heaven. It's a beautiful, beautiful ending.<br />Basically, Kid A is an odd one. Casual fans should probably stay away from it. But if you're up for a challenge, this is a thousand-level course that's worth it in the end.Thom sings \\"I'm lost at sea...\\", the track goes INSANE, and ends up sounding like the soundtrack to the apocalypse.

0805079831|5.0|I have read many very good treatises in the past few years on the harm this administration has done to our country and the world, but this book stands head and shoulders above them all. It was actually recommended to me by a UNICEF representative who had called me as part of a survey of donors to see what was of most current concern to me about the state of children in the world. It was when I told her I couldn't think of anything that WASN'T a concern and that I was losing all hope that change was possible that she mentioned Klein's book.  Even though 80% of the book is incredibly depressing, the ending is inspiring and the total message is mobilizing.  To borrow from her address to last year's American Sociological Association convention (available at democracynow.com), \\"another world IS possible\\"  if enough of us rise out of our \\"shock\\" and hopelessness and DEMAND change. This book should be required reading in every high school and college political science class and, at the very least, I pray that someone makes sure our presidential candidates read it.
0060760273|5.0|This is just the SWEETEST little set!  \\"Goodnight Moon\\" was a top favorite when I had little ones;  it's a great book for very small children because they love to point to the various characters, animals, and items in the pictures.  The words, when read soothingly at night, always helped them to calm down and settle into \\"sleepytime\\" mode.  My children are grown now; I purchased this set for a friend's grandchild.  She gets to have the little stuffed baby bunny, which wasn't around for my little guys.  I know she'll just love to have him!  In my opinion, this is THE best book for pre-bedtime storytime for small children.
0143038419|3.0|I got frustrated with the author after awhile.  It is an interesting story, and well written, but I just wanted her to stop complaining!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|This CD definitely sounds different from the original music, but it sounds wonderful. Keep in mind that everything is the same, it's just re-mastered, you can hear the vocals and bass much clearer now, among other things. Haven't had time to watch the DVD yet.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|I agree with everyone, except that I loved the minimalist sets because they allowed me to focus completely on the performers.  I almost held my breath waiting for The Met to release anything from last season...anything at all.  I was thrilled and ordered it immediately from them.  If I'd know Amazon would get them ( bought Puritani, too), I would have waited...but I didn't dare. Now I want them to let \\"The Barber of Seville\\" loose.  THAT was also incredible.  Joyce diDonato was thrilling...as was the entire cast.  When they do that, I'll buy it from Amazon.
B000UYX4OK|4.0|Why this movie has been ill criticized by many critics and plain movie goers is a mistery to me. I know that many complaints come from the fact that this is not a faithful adaptation of the epic poem. But first of all, it's been said many times that a movie should be judge by its merits alone (movies have a hard time translating the emotions and content of a book or a story) and I don't see any problem with making a movie just inspired in a legend, if it is well done.  This is the case with B&G. First of all, in spite of not having special effects, or CGI's, or big sets, it never looks cheap. The landscapes of Iceland are its best asset, because of their beauty and their quality and look of a legendary place. The costumes add authenticity too.  The acting is very good, specially Stellan Skarsgard as the tormented King Hrothgar and Sarah Poley (as usual) as Selma the Witch, with Gerald Butler providing an acceptable charaterization of the hero (which by the way is far from being a super-hero, and more down to earth).  The movie hasn't forgotten completely that some fantasy, legend or myth must remain in the story, but its approach is that all those legends must have had a human origin, magnificated and made mythical by the passing of time and oral tradition. And for me, this is a plus: it provides a human background to the story, and keeps it human for the most part. That may be a shock for many: if you expect a typical legendary monster movie, you won't find it here. Neither will you find a non-stop action movie \\"300\\" style. B&G is more drama than action.  I'm afraid to say that as a commercial product, the movie has some hollywod-esque concessions (constant cursing -somehow justified by the director and crew in their commentary-, the obligatory romance). But those are minor flaws, and I don't think that will affect you appreciation of the movie, once you have the proper frame of mind to watch it.    NOW ABOUT THE BLU RAY: I've read that the transfer has been criticized by some. The fact is that in daylight scenes this tranfer is as good looking as any I've seen. Believe me, the grandeur of the landscapes is reason alone to own this movie in Blu Ray. The mountains, the waterfalls, the beaches...make me wanna be there.  It's the nightime scenes that look a little ordinary, just standard, closer to a plain DVD. But I wouldn't put the whole blame in the quality of the transfer; it is that those scenes have been filmed with just the neccesary light. Is this a flaw? I don't think so. It provides more authenticity.  But yes, there is a particular scene (a dialogue between Beowulf and Hrothgar) that isn't even a nightime scene, in which the quality is very low, and that is because of the transfer and the original print: it looks stained and with a constant flashing. (That flashing is present also in another early daytime scene -when little Grendel is seen running in the beach-, but is less perceptible). But these are no reasons to dismiss the Blu Ray as a bad product, because most of the movie look pristine and very clear and detailed.    As for extras, well, this is the part in which the Blu Ray will leave you wanting. There's a commentary, which is said to be done \\"by the director and screenwriter\\" but that in fact includes a couple of more people, and that is very entertaining and informative -and is very insistent about this movie being made the old fashion way, little computer help). There is also \\"storyboard comparisons\\", and some trailers. The DVD version of the movie has more extras and that's something that I will never understand: do they really expect us to buy the DVD also just because it has more material in it?. Come on, be fair, and include the same material in the blu ray release !. This is what made me downgrade my rating.    The audio track is Dolby Digital, plus a PCM option. The dolby track is very good, just check a couple of scenes near a waterfall, or near the ocean and you will hear the water all around you. It also provides a good enhancement of the music during the movie. The feature only has ENGLISH subtitles.    So, if you loved this movie, there's no reason you shouldn't own this blu ray. If you have a blu ray player, this is a good movie to own. There's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy the story (I repeat, as long as you don't expect a faithfull retelling of the old poem, or an action-packed movie) but anyway, the Iceland landscapes won't let you regret it.
B000066HI4|3.0|This is the first CD I've heard of his, and I purchased it on the strength of reviews and word of mouth.  It is moody yes, but there really arn't any dynamics within the songs.  They are all slow, minimalist, with very little happening.  The melodies are usually directionless, and songs often lack recognisable structure.  Thus each song has a mood (generally dark) and really if you've heard part of a song, you've heard the whole of it musically.  I don't mean this to be a fully damning review however.  It works at what it attempts to do, and is not a bad album by any stretch.  Listening to it, I just felt that it could be much more powerful and atmosphic if there were some variation in tempo and intensity.

B000008JI1|2.0|I owned this C.D. for A couple of years , and well with the exception of   two Songs I never cared for the C.D. . It was not the Poison that I fell   In Love with in 1986 \\"Look What The Cat Dragged In\\"  . However like I said two songs on this C.D. I did like , yet \\"Stand\\" the only one of the  two that was ever released , or played much of . It is my Opinion that  the Song \\" Bodytalk\\" should have been another Hit from this C.D.

B000KN7BIQ|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time... so I was really hoping for a stellar transfer to Hi Def.  It's not as good as I was hoping for but it is still better than the original DVD release which was in (ugh!) pan and scan.  They have since released a 2-disc special edition that is widescreen but is more grainy than the hi-def version, but the hi def version does still have a fair amount of grain.  Is this version (HD) worth the purchase? Good question...especially since the demise of HD-DVD seems to be more inevitable with the Warner Bros. announcement that they will be going Blu-Ray only starting in May.  You may want to wait for it to be re-released on Blu-Ray and see if they remaster it.
0374105235|4.0|A Long Way Gone was inspiring, strong, touching and very, deep. It had some of it's gory parts but that was his story. It was basically about Ishmael Beah and how his life was affected by the war between the gov't & the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) in Sierra Leone. The war didn't just effect him physically, it effected him mentally and emotionally too. Until he was rehabilitated he didn't start to see the violence he had watched and caused himself, things he could not and cannot forget. Along Way Gone demonstrates that children all around the world are dealing with problems caused by issues in their country, and it's destroying their childhood. Anyone who reads it will love it and will most likely want to help children like Ishmael.

0743270754|5.0|This book is a faithful and comprehensive chronicle of Lincoln's ability to use people who certainly weren't yes men to form a strong Cabinet that allowed the country to survive the Civil War.  Lincoln did not believe that the President should pick people that would agree with him on every detail and not formulate the best ideas through discussion.  He also managed to take his strongest political rivals and bring them into a functional group.    I read this book last spring and was so impressed with the story and the writing that I bought 19 of them as Christmas gifts for my department at work.  I told the department in an accompanying note that they should read this as professional development.  Learn to be leaders without having to have total blind agreement.  I hope that I can learn to be a better leader and facilitator myself through this book.  Kudos to Doris Kearns Goodwin for a masterful study of a more complex President that we would have thought.
0143038419|4.0|After hearing so much about the book on various TV shows, and women commenting on it, Yes, I decided to purchase the book.<br /><br />The book is written with alot of entertainment, a play on words, she is very good in terms of being witty and capturing your attention. Although, she expands her stories to three locations. She looses me after Italy. The writing is still good, her description of emotions and experiences are still great. But I was a touch disappointed!<br /><br />Nonetheless, the book is about a journey in finding oneself, and I must admit was therapeutic for me, the book did manage to change my views on things. However I too, come from a long journey of events, and yes. I choose to find a sense of humour in life. So I do eat, pray, and love.<br /><br />I would recommend a definite read.
1577314808|1.0|Eckhart Tolle has accomplished a remarkable feat in &quot;The Power of Now&quot;: He has integrated his personal experience with the insights of numerous spiritual leaders into a book that thousands of readers have declared to be one of the best books they have ever read.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that Tolle seldom gives credit to those whose ideas he passes off as his own. (His sources include the Bible, the Buddha, the Advaita Vedanta, Rumi, Ajahn Sumedho, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Ramana Maharshi, Barry Long, Henri Bergson, and Meister Eckhart.) Instead, he begins by recounting a mystical experience he had when he was 29. His authority, he would have us believe, stems from this experience.<br /><br />Tolle calls his book &quot;a restatement for our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching, the essence of all religions.&quot; It was this essence that he believes he came to understand through his mystical experience. He asserts that the reader, too, can understand this essence by looking inside: &quot;The Truth is within you.&quot; There, the reader will see Tolle's Truth.<br /><br />Countless mystics have made the same mistake. They have assumed that their mystical experiences qualify them to speak as authorities on everything, from the nature of God to how to scramble eggs, and that their translations of experiences are true for everyone. The problem is that each mystic's articulation of his or her insight into Truth differs from the articulations of other mystics. Amazingly enough, these mystics can often find followers who believe so strongly in the Truth a mystic has pronounced that the followers will go out and kill nonbelievers.<br /><br />Tolle's assumption of authority leads him to make some very arrogant statements. For example, he says &quot;Even the men who wrote the Gospels did not understand the meaning of these parables, so the first misinterpretations and distortions crept in as they were written down. With subsequent erroneous interpretations, the real meaning was completely lost.&quot; (p. 96) Tolle then proceeds to explain the real meaning of the Gospels. Many scholars have, of course, pointed out the various discrepancies in and late additions to the Gospels, but few have had the audacity to say that they know what Jesus really said or what Jesus really meant.<br /><br />Furthermore, Tolle seems to think that his mystical experience qualifies him to teach women how to menstruate: &quot;When you know that the menstrual flow is approaching, before you feel the first signs of what is commonly called premenstrual tension, the awakening of the collective female pain-body, become very alert and inhabit your body as fully as possible. When the first sign appears...&quot; and so on, and so on. (p. 170) What intolerable presumption!<br /><br />The greatest service a spiritual writer can render, it seems to me, is to lead readers to those sources that the writer himself has found most rewarding and to show how he has integrated them for himself.

Many scholars have, of course, pointed out the various discrepancies in and late additions to the Gospels, but few have had the audacity to say that they know what Jesus really said or what Jesus really meant.<br /><br />Furthermore, Tolle seems to think that his mystical experience qualifies him to teach women how to menstruate: &quot;When you know that the menstrual flow is approaching, before you feel the first signs of what is commonly called premenstrual tension, the awakening of the collective female pain-body, become very alert and inhabit your body as fully as possible.

B0006A9FKA|1.0|i thought this movie was going to be better than i expected. but when i watched it, i couldnt really understand half the jokes, they were either talking too fast or too quiet, and the zombie parts were disturbing and unnecessary in this movie. overall, if you like movies that are laugh out loud crazy over the top comedies with violence with tradgedy and drama and romance all squeezed into 1 hour 40 minutes, then this is the movie for you.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie was fantastic, but it didn't get the marketing it deserved.  Big names like DeNiro, Pfeiffer and Danes with talented new faces should have gotten this film noticed, but it never happened.  Any fan of DeNiro will LOVE the pirate ship scenes.  Kids will like it, adults will LOVE it for the slightly higher level of laughs, thrills and romance.  A truly original story, and definately worth adding to your collection.
B00005MP58|5.0|I had never seen this version of Pride & Prejudice and fell in love with it.  This long version gives you the ability to delve into the characters, especially with the sisters.  It was a wonderful series of the Jane Austen classic.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I didn't take Geometry in HS... wasn't sure how I'd like this game.  I bought it for my husband who is gifted in Geometry.  I beat him 3x in a row.  I seriously love this game!  It's challenging and fun!
B0009W5JR8|1.0|My brother bought me this DVD as a gag gift.  I would have to say GAG fits my description of this movie very, very well.  Firstly I should note that I wasn't a huge fan of XXX with Vin Diesel, but it is an Oscar winner compared to XXX: State of the Union.  This movie was so ridiculous that it was down right funny.  There were times I was laughing so hard I had to excuse myself to the lavatory.<br /><br />Now for some reason good old Vin was not in this sequel.  So who do we get to replace Vin?  Ice Cube, yes Ice Cube.  I don't know about anyone else, but it seemed like Ice Cube was lost this entire movie.  As for the physical action he wasn't bad, but he just seemed to dim witted to know what was going on in this \\"want to be\\" 24 storyline.<br /><br />There were things also that made me laugh so hard I was in pain.  I also know that this wasn't the intention of the movie makers.  Also general observations I made about my reaction to this film....<br /><br />1) The CGI was so obnoxious in this movie it looked like a Playstation game.<br />2) In (at least) one of the stunt scenes an action figure is used. (Remember motorboat).<br />3) Ice Cube quotes 2Pac in the movie, too bad he can't act as good as 2Pac.<br />4) Helicopters are silent right before you jump on one.<br />5) Ice Cube is released from jail to save the USA, but never gets a pardon.<br />6) Ice Cube is supposed to save the USA.<br />7) The editing in this movie is worst that an Ed Wood movie.<br />8) Ice Cube made Vin Diesel look like Tom Hanks or Morgan Freeman.<br />9) Has Samuel L. Jackson made another good movie besides Pulp Fiction and the Star Wars prequels?<br />10) The President of the United States' \\"secret\\" train runs juxtaposition to I-95 or some other public interstate.<br />11)  Ice Cube can jump off a train that is going 260 mph and fall over 100 feet and still dive perfectly into the water.<br />12)  Ice Cube was in prison for almost ten years but has no problem understanding high tech weapons in mere minutes.<br />13) This movie really wanted to be a 007 film or an episode of 24.<br />14) The movie was made to promote a soundtrack.<br />15) Street thugs led by Xzibit can take on USA military intelligence.<br />16) The CGI was so obnoxious in this movie it looked like a cartoon.<br /><br />I could go on, but I won't.  This movie was just a poor excuse to cash in the XXX franchise, if there is even still a franchise after this bomb.  It was also a poor excuse to blow stuff up and make an action move.  Perhaps if this movie was just called State of the Union and no reference to XXX maybe it wouldn't have been so bad, nah.<br /><br />As for entertainment, I had plenty of laughs watching this movie.  I thought this movie was going to be bad, but I had no idea how hideous it really was going to be.  Since Vin Diesel was the first XXX and Ice Cube was the second, maybe Tom Green can be the third.  In conclusion, Showgirls has more depth than XXX: State of the Union.or an episode of 24.  14) The movie was made to promote a soundtrack.  15) Street thugs led by Xzibit can take on USA military intelligence.  16) The CGI was so obnoxious in this movie it looked like a cartoon.

B000Q6GUT8|2.0|This movie has a solid concept, and a lot of factoids about long range shooting. However, there is so much political spin and bias that it ruined the movie for this conservative. Starring ultra-liberal friend of dictator Hugo Chavez, Danny Glubber, the movie is like one big propaganda commercial. It portrays a Dick Cheney look-alike as the leader of the bad guys (who are evil government contractors who sound a whole heck of a lot like Halliburton), which seems to be typical out of Hollywood now. Republicans=bad is their theme in movie after movie. When are they going to get it that not everyone is a Democrat?
B000V1Y43W|4.0|My 4 year old son absolutely loves this movie.  I have the DVD and I bought the Blu Ray version for my son for Christmas.  I also have a Panasonic DMP-BD10-AK Blu Ray player that \\"upscales\\" standard DVDs as well.  The \\"but\\" in my review is that it is very difficult to see the differences between the standard DVD and the Blu Ray versions.  The real cheesecake for the Blu Ray version lies in the fantastic sound quality, java menus, and the bonus HD content on this disc.  If you have a robust home theater with solid surround sound, then this is a great purchase.
B0000042MY|5.0|This CD features all of the music from the film.  It is played in the order that the film plays it.  It is a wonderful soundtrack, absolutely one of my favorites!
B00005LC1H|5.0|This set is perfect for the British comedy enthusiast.  The complete series (everyone has a favorite episode!), great DVD quality, much better than the old VCR tapes!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This cd is wonderful! We listen to it all the time. It's fun for kids and even the whole family!
B00080ZG10|5.0|Actually, I saw Aviator at the theater, and bought the tape for my boyfriend, whom I thought had not seen it. I personally think the movie should have won best picture of the year. Leonardo, much to my surprise, depicted the real Howard Hughes beautifully. Cate Blanchard, who played Kathryn Hepburn, was amazingly believable, as was the person who played Ava Gardner. The special effects, especially when he crashed the plane were very dramatic and realistic. I am an aviation buff, and love movies about flying. Aviator had enough aviation to be satisfying, and an amazing inside look at the mind of this incredible man. His paranoia, his idiosyncrasies, and his charm were lain bare. It is very worth buying and keeping in your film library. I could watch it two or three more times and still see something new.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Let me start out by saying this is the best picture quality I have seen yet on ANY blu-ray!<br /><br />I bought this set after recently purchasing a Mitsubishi 65\\" 1080p TV and a Samsung P-1400 Blu Ray player. I have watched numerous blu-ray titles and Planet Earth is by far the best. PE is a must-buy for all blu-ray/HD-DVD player owners.<br /><br />Not only is the picture quality amazing, it is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. An absolute must-see for anyone even remotely interested in our planet.<br /><br />I watched the broadcast version in SD when it was being aired and obviously it is a completely different experience.<br /><br />Absolutely unbelievable. So what are you waiting for!<br /><br />BUY IT!

B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Being the last movie in the series it is all the one would expect for the final show down.  Highly recommended!!!!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Back in 1993 or '94 when this movie came out , a very good friend of mine told me I NEEDED to see it.  At that time he was one of the few people who had ever seen the movie (as it was not a hit in theatrical release),    I waited to see it until it came out on VHS.  I have loved it ever since.  Every time I watch the movie it amazes me.    The true beauty of the story lies in the fact that even in a place of gloom and despair people can change their lives.  Yes Andy Dufrene escapes but the true redemption lies in Red!!  He changes because of his relationship with Andy.  Even though Andy was innocent and obviously did not deserve to be or want to be in prison, without him going Red's life may never have changed!    Great movie, great message, GREAT actors!  One of the best ever!
078322799X|5.0|For years I avoided seeing this movie because of the awful cover art on the DVD. Will somebody please get this fabulous film a cover worthy of its content? To look at it, one would never assume that it is a rollicking comedy that takes perfect aim at satirizing the horror genre, and does it all to perfection!<br /><br />The special effects are so much fun, and without question, this is one of Michael J. Fox's best films. I have no doubt that the popularity of this underrated film will soar as word-of-mouth from those who passed it over initially but LOVE IT now gets around!<br /><br />If you are a fan of Michael J. Fox and you haven't yet seen this film, buy it sight-unseen with confidence.<br /><br />Bravo!

0486408434|5.0|The basic treatise on card magic. Though somewhat outdated, this is still the fundamental course on card sleights. Pretty good tricks in here too. Sound learning principles: learn sleight, learn tricks using the sleight, only then move on to next sleight. As this is inexpensive every magician ought to have this in his library, if only as a reference work.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This whole album sounds like it was written by Satan himself.  Fantastic stuff here.
0440238609|1.0|Didn't even enjoy the first one.  If you can get past all the religious weirdness (which is easily done because it's so far-fetched - it really doesn't deserve the fuss everyone is making about it), the stories are just confusing, boring, and depressing.  I am offended that people put these books in the same category as Chronicles of Narnia, LOTR, Harry Potter, and Madeleine L'Engle's Time books.  Those are wonderful works of literary genius that make you laugh and make you cry.  Good overcomes evil and you are left feeling better than you did before you began reading.  In other words, those books are everything that Pullman's stories are not.  In Pullman's stories, the lines between good and evil are so blurred that you have no idea what's going on and you don't care enough about the characters to get emotionally involved.  In addition, there's no innocence, there's no humour, and the descriptions are really hard to picture in your mind.  I am appalled they are labeled as children's literature, because no child needs to experience this hopeless and sad excuse for a fantasy story.  I plan on burning my copy.
B0002IQOZA|1.0|I bought this cd because of a recommendation and could not listen to it or hear the words for all the screechy \\"singing\\". Felt a headache coming............
0440238609|3.0|This author is very good, but he isn't sending a good message to young people. Maybe that wasn't his intention because fiction books are, after all, only imagination. His stories are fabulous, but what will be the after effects?
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The Bourne series is really good, with the proper mix of drama, emotion, and action.  I will always regret that they killed-off Jason's girlfriend (Marie) in Episode 2; Franka is one classy actress!  But the third installment is excellent, with good characters and a good story.  However, it NEEDS a fourth chapter!  The story is still open!
B000WTNCQS|4.0|Being a relatively new U2 fan, that is only for the last 10 years or so, I'm still amazed at how young the band looks in this video and others from the same time. (But I guess we all looked a lot younger 20 years ago, didn't we??!!)  Their music is so complex for some so young, I think.  I didn't realize that this DVD is more like a movie/documentary.  It's good to see, just unexpected.  It does contain lots of concert footage, however, which is very enjoyable.  The bonus CD contains a lot of B sides and take some getting used to.  Some of the songs are definitely not my favorites, yet anyway.  The remastered Joshua Tree CD is great.  All in all, a great addition to a U2 collection.
0740748475|5.0|Got a satisfactory product. All the Calvin and Hobbes in three books! Nothing more that I could have wished for. Good quality of books as well. A bit heavy, however to carry around :)
1594489505|4.0|This is a much faster read, I think, than The Kite Runner.  It is no less sad, however.    The story is intriguing and will keep you hooked; it's just hard to read in places because of the tortuous existence of the characters involved.  But I could not put it down once I started reading.  And it is a bit uplifting at the end.
B00000DHRX|5.0|This was a great CD purchase that wasn't easy to find in stores.  The shipment was fast and accurate and has me completely satisfied.
B000I2IT44|5.0|This DVD is very good. I own many CD's but I have not a chance to catch PT live. This was a close second and it keeps on giving. A must for PT fans!

B000KKPN5C|4.0|I have used Nikon speedlights for years, but they are not fully compatible with the digital SLR's. I decided on this model over the more expensive versions for two reasons. Size and price. The built in flash on the D80 handles most situations, and the SB400 gives you that extra boost for groups or distance shots. If you shoot large groups, then you might consider a more powerful flash, but if you want portability combined with decent power, this is the flash to buy. You have TTL and bounce capability, but lack the other fancy buttons. Again, the compact nature of this flash, gives you a low profile, versatile flash that will probably meet most needs for a lot less money.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|I am a huge Genesis fan and I have gone to all their concerts in the LA area in the last 20 years.  I like this livce CD a lot since it has nice old songs like \\"In the Cage\\" and good newer ones in the 80's  like \\"Home by the Sea\\" and \\"Domino\\".   A good all around live CD with great quality recordings all around.   A good collection for any Genesis fan.
0739334085|5.0|Most audio books are read aloud by actors.  This audio book is read aloud by the author, Barack Obama. Obama has a pleasant speaking voice.  The end result is that the listener has a golden opportunity to hear this major political figure talk about personal life, economics, race relations, education opportunity and -- oh yes -- politics.   Don't miss this opportunity.      Glenn Rennels
1580088694|5.0|Well-written book, a sobering look at what the world eats, and a wake-up call for better nutrition for most of the \\"developed\\" world.
0740748475|5.0|I have always loved Calvin & Hobbes, though not obsessively. I have many of the other books, but not all of them. I had always intended to 'get them all', and this collection gave me that chance. Here they are, essentially all of them. Mostly presented in the order they were originally published, with the publishing date at the bottom of each page. Three daily strips or one Sunday strip to a page. Over 10 years worth at 3 pages per week. Sunday strips are sometimes presented early or late, in order to avoid interuppting a daily theme that continues through the weekend. There is also a nice forward to the book with lots of good information, but I had to read the comics first.    I bought this collection in order to read it, and re-read it, not to just sit it on the shelf as a collector's item. It is very heavy, which is good and bad. Good because there is much to enjoy, and because the physical materials are of good quality. Bad because it can be difficult to comfortably curl up in your favorite chair with such a large book. The books are very long, and open nicely when laid flat however. I do have some concern over whether the bindings will hold up to heavy use. While they seem adequate, all the pages being well secured, I did notice some looseness with the cover in one of my volumes. It is also somewhat difficult to get the volumes out of their case, as there is no way to actually get a grip on them. You need to tilt the whole box forward until they slide out a bit.    I have already read through the whole collection, and was in stitches a good part of the time. This set is well worth the money, and if you can get it on sale, even better. I'm only sorry that there will be no further adventures of Calvin, Hobbes, Susie, Mom, Dad, and Rosalyn. Oh, and that Moe never got what was justly his.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|My son and I love watching it together. SM was my idol as I was growing up, and now he is so also for my son. Good movie!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I purchased this series for my parents for Christmas.  Mom called this morning to say how much they are enjoying the set.  The wonders of the earth really speak to God's creative glory captured for all to see on DVD.[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]]
B000A59PMO|5.0|The first season of Veronica Mars is one of the best seasons of TV that exists.  The characters are fleshed out and the storylines are far superior to any other show.  Kristen Bell is an amazing actress who portrays the title character flawlessly.  Trust me, buy this today and experience the greatness for yourself!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|First of all this is a great show. The plot, characters, scenery, special effects and acting are all superb. It is evident that a lot of effort goes into every episode and it certainly pays off. It will keep you interested from the very start.     Jennifer Garner is amazing in her role as Sydney Bristow, a CIA agent. Along with her father, Jack Bristow, played by Victor Garber, another CIA agent. In addition to the Bristow's there is a cast of excellent characters including Sydney's love interest, Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan) and the arch nemesis though sometimes not Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin). The intricate story line and obvious character chemistry make this show one that can be quite addicting and for good reason.    As for this box set it has everything you could ever want out of Alias. All 5 seasons, with bonus features, a small booklet with interesting facts, as well as a super secret hidden disk with more bonus. Not to mention its enclosed in a Rambaldi box replicate which is beautifully crafted and an excellent choice to store all of the amazing things. Additionally, this set is limited edition as only 40 000 copies were made, so get it before it's too late!    Overall if you are a fan of the show and have been holding off on getting the season then BUY THIS, you wont be disappointed. Even if you aren't a hardcore fan and just like the show this is still great for you, you won't be sorry for buying it, although you may be sorry that you have a lack of social life due to the fact that you are sitting at home watching episode after episode just to find out what happens next.
0143038419|5.0|I love this book.  It's a great autobiograpy, plus it enlightens your own life as well.  I would recommend this book to anyone to get to know yourself more.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is one of the most unusual and comprehensive body of photographic work on nature that I have seen.  The photography is awesome and the detail in each of the subjects is amazing.  One scene on a mountain took over four years for a rare animal to show up...talk about dedication!    The PBS series featured Sigourney Weaver doing the narration here in the USA...the narration on the original BBC series is done by a British actor and is just as impressive.    I bought this video for my grandchildren.  They range in age from almost 4 to 14 and they are all riveted to the television when we show it to them.  I would highly recommend it for all ages!
B000E97Y6A|1.0|I am a big King Kong fan since the original with Fay Wray. I've even made a point of catching reruns of \\"King Kong vs. Godzilla\\" (King Kong wins by the way). The remake with Jeff Bridges was OK. Special effects much improved. Not even the special effects could save this movie with Jack Black who seemed like he was asleep for most of it. I have not been able to sit through the entire movie even once. I fast forward to where I left off. Don't waste your money. Wait for it to come on free TV, if ever. If not, no big loss. I would give this zero stars if I could.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This is a must see for all the Bourne fans. Fantastic. Five stars all the ways.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|It's nice to have all these hits in one package. even the DVD is great too. Another nice thing was there were hits on here by him I didn't even know about.
B000O176Q6|5.0|I am probably not as big of a fan of Bruce Lee as other amazon reviewers. I do like Kung-Fu action films and I am more of a fan of Jacky Chan. I bought this blu-ray just to add to my collection because it has Bruce Lee, Jacky Chan, and Sammo Hung in the same movie!!    I think the colors are remastered because they look vivid and great, especially in the bonus when they show clips of the old film you can really tell how you would not want to watch it if it were not.  Due to it's old age, the film does still have some \\"dust\\" or \\"noise\\" in some of the scenes, but in very minimal scenes, and when it happens it's still pretty clean. Probably alot of people won't even notice this, I'm the type of person that won't even goto the theaters anymore because the constant dust and dirty film quality bothers me.    What I really love are the bonuses, especially the interview with Bruce Lee himself, interview with his wife, documentary of Bruce's life history and the death of Bruce Lee and his son Brandon. Interviews with people that worked with Bruce also confirms all the great things about this Legend and some more.    I have gained even more respect for Bruce Lee after watching the film plus the documentaries and interviews. I really want the release of Game of Death on blu-ray now because that seemed to be the film Bruce worked hardest on and cared most about. They need to include all the lost footages of Bruce in Game of Death and I hope this really happens.    This is a great buy for even a person that is not a fan of Bruce, and after watching this you will definitely become a fan. FIVE STARS for this blu-ray even with a little noise in a couple scenes.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|This is some of their best work yet. I was really impressed by the versatility of this album. You can tell they put a lot into it.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|Do you remember where you were in 1987, if you were born then? I do. I was living in Canada, playing in a band, hoping to make it big like a million others. I was listening to the radio, trying to think of good songs to cover to help pad out our play list, as we hadn't written many originals. Then \\"With or Without You\\" came on the air. It was totally different to anything I had heard in a while. I'd had a similar feeling when I heard KISS, then the Sex Pistols, some of the early New Romance music, but this made the hairs on my arms stand up. I had to have more. So I listened to hear who it was, and was surprised it was U2. I had heard snippets of their earlier albums, but I must admit at the time I was into hair band metal, Iron Maiden, Scorpion's, that sort of thing. Well I had to have more!    I went to the local record shop, and bought The Joshua Tree on vinyl and cassette (for the car!). Boy did it change me. I still liked the other stuff I was into, but this changed my whole direction of music, until Pearl Jam came along in 1991. If I was stuck on an island with only 10 albums, The Joshua Tree would be on that list.     I was excited to hear it was being remastered and reissued for the 20th anniversary. The extras are great too, and it is a must have for my collection. Sadly, my vinyl copy is long gone (I still have the liner notes and picture though!), and I think I wore out my cassette tape. My CD is well used, so this will be a welcome addition to my collection!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is absolutely amazing, the filming is like no other. Plus you will actully learn a lot watching the videos.
B000V7O0H6|4.0|Great movie and it is made better with the fact that it is in HD

1594489505|5.0|This book was even better than \\"Kite Runner\\". A heart breaking story of life in modern day Afganistan. It's a hard and powerless life for women there, makes one appreciate how courageous they are and how fortunate we are as Americans. A lesson in history and human values.
B000K15VSA|5.0|MINDBLOWINGLY BRILLIANT!!!    This is why I got into DVD movies in the first place.  A chance to see delected scenes, commentary on the film by the creators, interviews, alternate takes on the film, special effects insites, costuming creation, art work and set design talks and anything else to accompany my favourite films.  To date, there has only been a handful of really value packed DVD titles, most notable were the Criterion collections 'Brazil' and Buckaroo Banzai adventures across the 8th dimension.  With all that space why only put the movie and maybe a trailer if your lucky?    Well here we have Blade Runner The Ultimate Collector's Edition and I just have to say it again fellow fans and new comers alike.  It's mind blowing.  Simply the best Blade Runner release EVER.  Period!!    This collection is worth 4 times the price.  In fact I probably paid that trying to hunt down the rare versions.  Oh how I wish I had simply waited for this.  Not only did I get better versions of all those poor quality bootleg releases I chowed down over the years, I got what I can only describe as 'bigger, better, more'.    Now that I've ranted I'd better review the material briefly.  What you get is 5 amazing discs that I strongly feel will put many manufacturers to shame and bring a new age of decent DVD releases increasing the bonus material to previously undreamed of heights, like the magnificient 'Blade Runner' release here.    The Final Cut, is simply stunning.  I'm going to make a point of emailing Ridley to thank him a million times over for going to great lengths in giving this unique film the treatment it so rightfully deserves.  The final cut is basically 'The Directors Cut' that came out in 1992, BUT with a few major additions.  There's an extra minute of footage but that's not what blew my mind.  It's the total touch up magic that has been pain stakingly carried out on the footage and the sound is FANTASTIC. I was always dissapointed with the Directors Cut sound, in that it was so stereo sounding.  The DVD release(of which I've given away upon aquiring this incredible treasure trove along with all my other dodgy versions), back in 1992 was also a major let down with next to nothing other than a trailer.  The Final Cut fixes all that with brilliant commentaries, a nice intro by Ridley Scott and did I mention the picture and sound are now positively top notch with not a single complaint from this hard core fan.  Oh and I should also mention your in for a treat with some nicely added affects and oh so perfect lighting.  Look I can't say anymore as I don't want to spoil it for those who have not yet seen this brilliant final cut.    If the bonuses on the first disc were not enough, there's 4, YES '4' extra DVD's chock a block full of Blade Runner goodness.  2 of these give you the other 4 versions of the film (not just transferred on a whim, ALL fixed up as best as they could be and given 5.1 channel sound enhancment), you get the 1992 directors cut, the 1982 US Theatrical Cut, the 1982 International Cut and something I've never been able to obtain.  The rediculously mega rare until now PRE-RELEASE WORKPRINT version of the film(this was the initial viewing film that was post theatre release).  I had to read the cover 4 times just to convince myself it was actually there, not to mention sit in astonishment starring at a title screen (my flat mate thought I had lost it when I apparently sat there for half an hour just looking at the screen afraid to push the play button).  Needless to say this is a VERY good thing.    If that wasn't fantastic enough, you get another 2 disc loaded to the brim with what I can only describe as a treasure trove of Blade Runner additions.  You get interviews with so many of the cast, you'll have to write down the names to keep track of them all, you get documentaries the likes of which rarely grace a film in such majestic splendor, stacks of footage highlighting the costuming, artwork, prop creations, SydMead's own spotlights and then....    Massive drum roll....   You get approximately(I still havn't counted them as I've only seen the first 5 and will need a viewing time just to view them),  about 20+ deleted scenes, so far all of them featuring amazing valuable footage I'd never seen nor heard of until now.  For example there's a scene were Deckard talks with Howard after his 'little' encounter with Leon.  I'll not describe it, if your a fan and you must be to have kept reading my ranting review, it's a must see, along with all  the other great pieces of footage which have now expanded the movie even further for me.    In a nutshell this collection is overpowering for the discs alone, combined with a trendy collectors brief case, replica polymer chromed Unicorn, art folder, motion film cell and a replica scaled police spinner car with vertically opening doors just like in the film that I can fly around with in my living room(YOU ROCK SYD!!!), it's simply beyond amazing value, quality and any other '...ity' you care to mention.    FLAWLESS DVD RELEASE (5 OUT OF 5), no problems what soever and anyone who whinges at this is either not a Blade Runner fan or a ludicrous individual who's either close to death or in fact a replicant.    Grab it while you can or you'll deffinately be left behind and forgotten like 'tears in rain'.
0143038419|3.0|I heard about this author from watching the Oprah show. Since Oprah and her viewers  was so ecstatic about this book I purchased it for myself. It'a a good read. Liz is intelligent to a degree. But she should have left her radical political views out of the book. They don't belong in this book. Too many times she mentions our country's President and her opinion about his leadership skills. That almost made me throw the book out the window! But......I am not giving up yet. At the moment I am on the second chapter...India. I love the first chapter when she talks about Italy and the food there and people and towns. But India sounds a little bit weird. Maybe I just can't relate. My opinion is it is a fair book and the author is quite the weirdo. She is definitely a typical leftist  Liberal. I try to keep politics out of things, but when I run across her leftist views in the book, it turns me off. If she wanted her views broadcasted she should have written a political opinion type of book.
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|The brooding landscape is the real star of this new adaptation of Jane Eyre. Both lead actors are too conventionally pretty to be convincing, rendering their comments about plainness/ugliness patently absurd. Wilson has some good moments as the stolid, composed Jane in the face of endless hardship; and Stephens makes a persuasive case in the declaration of love scene. But the updated dialogue, Jane's teasing retorts to Rochester, and especially the makeout scene -- on a bed, no less, and between a religiously devout pre-Victorian virgin and the man who just betrayed her -- ring completely false. The hinted-at sexual aspects of the novel are overplayed here. To top it off, Bertha, the lunatic wife, who in the book was feral and unkempt, here appears beautifully groomed and MTV ready. How far Masterpiece Theatre has fallen!
1594489505|5.0|One of the best books I have read in years. A must read for anyone!!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Saw the concert at Georgia Tech in the mid 90s. Awesome show and I play this DVD when I want to get the goose bumps again.
0439882826|5.0|This book is amazing.  My son loved this; he's five and loves everything about Star Wars.  The quality of the book is top quality.  This is a must have for kids who loves Star Wars.
B000AXWV40|5.0|This album is the best investment i ever made. I'm a 16 and i play guitar and the solo on maggot brain puts every guitarist i've ever heard to shame,i t moves me to tears every time and eddie hazel has got nowhere near the recognition it deserves.  I can't believe more people haven't heard this. And its not just the title track, EVERY song on here gets 5 stars from me. This band puts the supposed heaviest band ever, black sabbath, to shame on super stupid. its super heavy and on top of that you can dance to it and eddie hazel plays another classic solo. enough from me you should get it now, it criminal to not recognize this album for the masterpiece it is.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|Great show. We were surprised just how much our kids liked it. We are seeing the show live in January!
B0000CABBW|5.0|This film is gorgeous and powerful.  It also has a great deal to teach us about other cultures, about nature, about gender.  I bought it initially for an adult who turned out to already own it so I gave it to my young nieces.  They loved it.  They may not know exactly what the back story is, but the story of having a mission and being a girl in a man's world is universal.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Great cd, she's such an amazing singer.  I love the fact that she can sing any genre of music!  I definitely recommend this cd!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I live in The Netherlands and I bought the Blu-ray Box in the US, although I knew that there is a difference in Standards between the US en Europe. Nevertheless this Documentary is regionsfree and is playable on my PS3! The quality is in one word \\"gorgeous\\", for sure i.c.w. my Sony Bravia Full HD TV. (1080p) I think you have to own these Series, which give a beautiful sight on the nature and the wildlife in our world!
B000W4HJ44|5.0|The music is wonderful. Nikki Blonski is outstanding. John Travolta is hilarious! We enjoyed the other cast members also. Definitely worth watching!!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|One of the best movies so far made by PIXAR. Different story and wonderful animation. Hats off.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I wish the movie was longer because the story was very good and the characters were very well developed.   It was too entertaining to be only a couple of hours.   They should bring the series back on T.V. The returning serie's ploit should fill in the story plots between the end of the original series and the movie.  Then show the movie, from then on have run the new show on NBC.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I am a magician, so I am biased, but I LOVED this movie.  Highly recommended....
B000W07EKW|5.0|Good entertainment with excellent casting and scenery, suitable for the entire family. Had it not been for the \\"Letter Box Format,\\" this would have been a great collection.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I've loved this movie forever. The first time I saw this movie was in black and white and that is how I still prefer to watch it.
0143038419|4.0|Eat Pray Love by Elizabeth Gilbert  is a fun read about serious life changing events such as marriage,divorce,spirituality and love in relationships. The three settings of her comeback are exotic in themselves.
B000I2JKCO|1.0|i got this for my son for christmas, he wanted it so badly. on christmas day, after he opened it, he wanted to watch it. it does not  play at all. we tryed it in 2 dvd players, and our computer, with no luck. to say we were upset is to put it very nicely. p.s. i had to put a star on for fast delivery.  jb
0143038583|5.0|I actually bought two of these books--both to give as gifts to people I thought would also enjoy this thought-provoking book.  It was chosen as the book all the freshman read and discuss in groups at the local college where my husband teaches.  He passed his copy on to me and I was excited enough to want to create my own \\"discussion\\" group.  It is changing the way we look at the food we buy.  Highly recommended.
6304936362|5.0|One of the best depictions of B-17 crewmen and the stresses they faced on a daily basis during the war.
014028009X|5.0|Adore this book. Read it every year. It has gotten me through break ups, break downs, and life in general. Thank you Bridget.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|A rat in the kitchen - who'd have thought that it would lead to one of the very best movies of the year?  Concise, vivid, hilarious & surprisingly touching, a triumph of storytelling.  When the Peter O'Toole character has his first bite of Ratatouille, it is one of the finest movie moments of the year.  A completely satisfying experience.
075640407X|5.0|This book was amazing. Seriously.  Amazing.  I read it in three days.  I couldn't put it down.  It actually reaffirmed my faith in the competency of modern writers. I literally hadn't read a book in over two years when my mother gave this to me last October and said \\"I've been hearing good things about this book and I thought you might like it.\\"  In boredom on my flight home, I started reading it, and I was in love.      After I finished the book (and realized I didn't have another installment to run out and buy) I looked to other authors I had never even heard of before to satiate this new appetite of mine.  I have been reading constantly for the past three months and I've gone through at least 11 books in that time.  I discovered Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Tim Powers all of which are amazingly talented writers who create amazing stories.  But none drew me in as much as this book.  (Patrick, if you're reading this, I know you think Gaiman is a god, but seriously you're at least on par with him.)    The characters were so rich and vibrant.  I absolutely LOVE Kvothe's interactions with his friends at school.  They're so... real!  Their conversations aren't annoyingly scripted.  I could actually imagine myself having conversations like this.  That is, if I went to magic school.      And best of all, it's a fantasy novel written for adults!  I honestly didn't even know that kind of thing existed before I read this novel.      But now I must wait another year.  A year!  One year until I get to read the second book.  And then who knows how long until the third one.  Harry Potter (lame excuse for fantasy, by the way) readers at least had the comfort of knowing their next book was written and would be coming to them within the next year.  Book two is still being edited, and book three hasn't even been started!  No fair!      It's time to get busy Rothfuss!
1598875329|3.0|Jonathan Winters does a good job of narrating this Christmas classic, but the abridgment is pretty severe. Too much good stuff is left out. I prefer the unabridged Jim Dale version. My favorite is the unabridged cassette version read by Paul Scofield, but it seems to be out of print. If I could find that one on CD, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
B000R5N1MC|5.0|An absolutely gorgeous film. Of course, if I could take three tries for everything, I might get it right, too. The first version seemed a little too cute and almost flip; just about 2 clicks too happy. But, of course, you didn't know that until you saw the directors cut, which, in the end, seemed about 2 clicks too glum.   But seeing this version, and after all these years, not even keeping the state of the art of 1982 in context, is an astounding experience. It is simply beautifully done. It all just seems so right. It is amazing how they have seemed to create something so whole and in some way, seamless and beautiful, and yet, gripping. And I've seen the darn thing (both versions) several times. As they said for Men in Black II, \\"See again for the first time\\".  I don't know what kind of awards are available for this kind of work, but all involved deserve the highest recognition for their achievement.  Job well done!
B000P6YNSE|4.0|I hate this Show. Really I do. Why is it that you desperately look forward to every next season of LOST and after each show get more exited to watch the next - and then at the end of the season... More questions then ever. But to be honest - its thrilling! The characters are interesting, the plot gets more and more crazy, the set is brilliant. In a few words: LOST gets better and better, I hate it more and more and totally lost it. Just watch!
1878424505|5.0|May be the essence of what you will read in this book could sound familiar to you depending if you had previously read books on oriental philosophy or written by Carlos Castañeda, but what is valuable about the \\"Four Agreements\\" and the other books by Don Miguel Ruiz, is the simple way he uses to describe a new guide that people can put into practice to make easy the way of life in these complicated modern times. If you use the four agreement, your inner life could improve, despite the author recognizes that to apply the agreements all the time in your daily life could be difficult, what it is important is to have in mind all the principles. The author uses practical examples to describe the agreements  that has a lot of sense. I  totally recommend this book and the others written by this author.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|While the story is not an original (adapted from a Chinese film I believe), the directing and acting makes this a must own for any dvd collection.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This was a gift for my son who loves Blade Runner.  He was very happy with it.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Fantastic. I listen while commuting to work. Helps make the trip easier to deal with bad drivers. I like Michael better than Sinatra, his vocal styling    evokes a quiet seduction of the senses.
0060005696|4.0|This book is a good supplement for any advertising, public relations or marketing professional. Goes into quantitative data to prove its point on how selections are made. The author does seem to become over redundant in many points, right when it talks about how much time you have invested in the book and finishing it.
B00005JPFH|4.0|Love the first one.  Seems like the 3rd is good but similar good guy versus bad guy theme.
B000QUEQBI|5.0|Great movie. should watch on HDTV I'm really please with my purchase,( gift for my husband, he loved it)
B000VDDDVO|4.0|I got this DVD for my grandaughter for Christmas.  She was  very happy with it.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I had not seen It's a Wonderful Life for many years, and found this 60th anniversary edition to be a timeless message of hope at a time when the world needs it so much. The additional features (making of the film, etc.) on this DVD made it even better.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|[[ASIN:B000W7JWUA The Settlers of Catan - New 4th Edition!!!!!]]This board game is addictive.  My two teenage sons and I have played it almost daily since opening the box Christmas Day.  The object is to be the first person to get 10 points; you do this by purchasing roads that link settlements(1 point) and cities(2 points). You \\"buy\\" all of these things using the resource cards you acquire through rolling the dice. Trading \\"resources\\" with other people is essential to get what you need. Easy to set up, game time for experienced players(after 2-3 times) is 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Think Risk without the cut-throat nature and it doesn't take 6 six hours to play a game.
0743277457|5.0|I've been playing chess for lots of years and am interested in martial arts. I find the book very interesting and share the ideas of Josh.
B00008PX8P|4.0|I am a Zeppelin fan from the mid-1970s.  I saw the band live on the 1977 U.S. tour.  This DVD set captures the band early in their career, at their peak in the mid-70's and in their twilight in 1980.    I would prefer a complete concert from the mid-70's as opposed to the Madison Square Garden / Earl's Court / Knebworth combination offered on the second DVD, but I'll take what I can get.    The highlights for me are Misty Mountain Hop the acoustic set of Goin' to California, Bon-Yur-Aur Stomp and That's The Way.  Both show the band very loose and playful.    Highly recommended.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|I thought that the movie, Zodiac, was very well produced, directed and cast.  At the same time, I thought that the movie focused a bit too much on Robert Graysmith.  (They didn't even mention the first Zodiac killing on Lake Herman Road in Benicia.)  Also, the \\"birthday\\" call from the supposed Zodiac to Melvin Belli was very miss leading. For facts about the case, go to zodiackiller.com and look up Michael Butterfield.  Another great site is Jake Werk's site, \\"This is the Zodiac Speaking\\".  There is also some great, vintage footage, etc. on You Tube.
B000W1V44I|5.0|People always write off the Backstreet Boys because of the genre they got shoved into, and they miss the real talent these guys have. I'm a definite BSB fan (and proud of it!) so I bought this album as soon as it came out, not bothering to listen to more than a few song previews. The first time I listened to it, just flipping through the tracks, I was a little bit disappointed. I was hopelessly in love with Never Gone, despite the predictable melodies and lyrics, and I refused to like anything that was different. But after listening to Unbreakable a few more times I started to realize that yes, Unbreakable is very different from Never Gone, and that's rather a good thing. I love the tracks that first bothered me because they were different; Everything But Mine, One In a Million, and, especially, Panic (I LOVE Panic!), among others. Of course, there are also quite a few songs with those Never Gone lyrics and beautiful (if cliché) melodies that I fell in love with when Never Gone first came out, like Something That I Already Know, You Can Let Go, Trouble Is, etc. This is one of those rare CDs that I can listen to all the way through without skipping a single track (although Treat Me Right leaves me slightly bewildered). I can say now that I don't regret my impulse buy in the least.  OUtstanding tracks: Unmistakable, Panic, Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon, One in a Million, Something That I Already Know
B00117P0HE|5.0|I've never played the games, and I missed Apocalypse, but I thoroughly enjoyed Extinction. I don't know, but I've been a Mila Jovovich fan ever since The 5th Element. Although a little short on story, maybe because it's been carried through 3 movies, but it definitely makes up for it in action.    I agree with the \\"Stop rating the unbox service\\" review. Please only review the movie at hand. I had no problem downloading this movie on the 7th of Jan., 08, so I can't fathom what problems others have experienced. I also liked that I could start watching the movie before the download was finished, and it worked flawlessly, my movie wasn't ever interrupted, (however, people with different Internet connection may have a different experience). ***** for Unbox.
B000W07EKW|5.0|Everything was fine with the seller. Amazon needs to not hassle me about writing reviews though.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Jazz like no other. She sure shows off her stuff on this CD. She has a beautiful voice. Smokey and warm just makes you want to light the fire and have a very merry evening. The band backing her is just the best. They are cooking. If you want a VERY Jazzy Christmas CD this is the one. You will not be disappointed. This is my husbands favorite Christmas CD.  Being a Jazz drummer he just loves it.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I bought this DVD for my husband as a Christmas present. He wasn't expecting it but he did love it. I wasn't really expecting the DVDs to be as long as they were. We still haven't watched the second DVD. This is definitely something I don't regret buying. It has so many wonderful musicians, amazing commentary and interviews. It's such a great purchase. I'm glad I didn't pass this up!
B00011F5DK|4.0|This is a great family toy. Everyone in our family, from 7 to 40, loves it and can fully participate. You never know who is going to win. I definitely recommend it.
B00006RINF|5.0|My son really enjoyed getting this CD.  he has shopped the stores for it for a while and Amazon offerred the best price.  It was shipped quickly and was in great condition when he got it.  thanks.
0786191465|5.0|If you've read the book - which I suggest you read the book so you can really digest its meaning - the audio provides a great avenue to hear it again.  I spend 2 hours in the car everyday and having the audio text of Frankl's work is a nice distraction from the 'speed' of the day.  I would add though, if you haven't read the text, listen to it.  There is much meaning to draw from it and apply to your own life.  Very insightful generally speaking, the audio doesn't detract.  I'm a book guy to begin with and that is why I would suggest the book before the audio.  Either way, one of the most influential works I've ever read.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I bought the complete 7 seasons of Gilmore Girls for my 17-year-old daughter for Christmas. She has been a fan the past few years but was catching them in reruns and out of order and missing several episodes. So, now she has the complete story and our entire family is hooked. This was a perfect gift for her and anyone who is a fan of the fast-talking, witty mother-daughter team.
0143038419|1.0|I had a really hard time finishing this book.There were times where I was just going to give up, but I forced myself to finish with the glimmer of hope that it would miraculusly get better. And to my dismay, it never did.The memoirs of Italy were ok, but once she went to India, she lost me. I did not feel bad for her in the least. She had a rough divorce, and that is nothing to laugh about, but who do you know that has enough money to just leave and travel for as long as she did? And didn't the medicine man say she would have one child, but she never did. The romance with Felipe is when the book was slightly interesting, but she did not spend enough time with that subject. And why did Wayan get to be sketchy in the end?They did not spend enough time on that subject either.   In my opinion, this book was not good, not at all. Please do not waste your time or money on this.I think if maybe the author opened up more on wy her relationship failed with her husband it could have gotten slightly interesting.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Een fantastische serie geweldig van kwaliteit van prettig commentaar voorzien.  En leuk meegenomen de dvd is regio vrij
630463949X|5.0|If you like Fleetwood Mac and you dont have this dvd go out and buy it! This is a fantastic dvd, and it is fast becoming my favorite. It is a must have for Fleetwood Mac fans. So what are you waiting for?!
B00005T30L|5.0|Had seen this movie about halfway through on cable.  Had to buy it to see the rest.  Good acting, good actors/actresses, subtle story line.
B000WC39ZE|3.0|Seller did not make it clear that the CD was not a CD of the tunes from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (it was a selection of unrelated songs from the 60s). I wouldn't have bought it had I known.  Movie is fantastic though.
