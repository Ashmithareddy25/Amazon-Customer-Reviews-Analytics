B001OQCV6A|4.0|It just dawned on me that the characters are simply similar to those we see on the show House. Neither person be whole or healthy but together an interesting team. Holmes is a brilliant man with logic and deduction, but lacking care for proper hygiene and has horrible social skills. Watson, although endowed with a respectable job, is flawed in his relationships with women and money. Out of some twisted obligation to one another, they seem powerless to ever really separate for long. They are like the archetypes in both show/movie plots. Funny.<br /><br />The cinematography and use of flash backs and forwards to create resolution is playfully well done and interesting. You're not left completely out of the loop whilst the dysfunctional duo is attempting to solve the mystery behind the resurrection of an evil mastermind/religious zealot. Obviously, you have to suspend disbelieve and just enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Overall it's like House meets Harry Potter, set a couple blocks down from the Barber of Fleet Street ;)
B002RAREAK|5.0|Since the tragic death of the King of Pop back in the summer of 09, there has been a very large void in the music industry that desperately needs to be filled, and the only man i believe is anywhere close to talented enough to be able to fill MJ's shoes would be Usher. Usher has had the R&B/Pop genre on lock since 1997 when he was only 18 and already had a number one hit in the form of the classic \\"You Make Me Wanna\\". And since than, Usher has given us countless smash singles (a few of which were record breakers), and four multi-platinum albums. Now granted, only two of those albums would I consider to be listen worthy (Confessions, and Here I Stand) besides the singles, because thats one thing that Usher has always been able to give us was hit singles. He just knows how to make catchy stuff. And while a lot of people thought the highly anticipated follow up to his instant classic Confessions, Here I Stand, was a disappointment, I personally thought it wasnt all that bad. I mean it was defenitly no where close to Confessions, but it was still an above average album that he spent a lot of time working on. And honestly, anything from Usher is normally a lot better than half of the crap on the radio these days. But with all that said, RVR (Raymond V. Raymond) was staged to be Usher's big comeback album and his return to his \\"single sex symbol\\" days. And the thing that made Here I Stand kind of hard to review was the fact that no matter what that album was going to be looked at as a disappointment because there was no way he was going to be able to put out an album that was anywhere close to as good as Confessions was. But with RVR, he doesnt have that same competition he had with his last album, which makes RVR a lot easier to accept. And right off the bat Usher established himself as a single man again with the first promo single \\"Papers\\", which is so far the biggest hit off the album as it reminds a lot of people of his Confessions stuff because the song is a balladabout his highly publicized divorce. And then on the first official single, the mid tempo banger \\"Daddy's Home\\", Usher boasts his new single marital status even more by pretty much stating he's back for all his female fans. And the up tempo club banger \\"Lil Freak\\" is the closest thing to \\"Yeah\\" hes made since Confessions. \\"Lil Freak\\" could easily be a huge hit similar to \\"Yeah\\" if promoted properly. But the song on the album that will remind fans of Usher the most of Confessions would be the beautiful break up ballad \\"Foolin' Around\\", where Usher pretty much says he's been unfaithful yet again with his significant other. But \\"Foolin' Around\\" is easily the most Confessions like song on the album, as it sounds almost identical to a \\"Burn Pt.2\\". But where RVR truly shines the most is on the three tracks produced by former collaborators Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. Jam & Lewis have always been great producers for Usher, dating all the way back to his 8701 album. They always set the mood perfectly for his albums, and that was one of the big thing I felt like was missing on Here I Stand was production from the legendary duo. And they continue their stellar production trend on RVR, starting with the extremely funky and groovy opening track \\"Monstar\\", which so far is my favorite track on the album as it reminds me sooooo much of something Michael Jackson would have done if he were still around. And on the almost reggae-ish bedroom banger \\"Pro Lover\\", Usher gives his fan's another swagger filled signature Usher track, which is another Jam & Lewis track and another one of my favorites on the album. And the last of the three gems produced by Jam & Lewis is the spacey slow jam \\"Mars Vs. Venus\\", its a very unique and dreamy song sure to be among the fan favorites. But don't get to excited either, because RVR does have some low points. Like on the just flat out lame and boring \\"Guilty\\" and the sad attempt at a club banger \\"So Many Girls\\". And \\"OMG\\" is probably the most annoying songon the album as it reminds me of a song Souljaboy would do with some lame D grade singer. But Usher still has the majority of the album as banger, like the super banger \\"She Don't Know\\" which I can already picture hearing that song all the time in the club, and the mid tempo Jim Jonsin ballad \\"Making Love\\" is also a standout with Ush's smooth and rich vocals stealing the show on that track. And another thing that really helped this album, is the shorter track listing. I don't think Usher could put out another 20 track album, and have it still be a classic. The 14 song track listing is perfect for the album, and i feel like that was part of the reason Here I Stand wasnt as potent was because it was to long. Like I said overall, RVR was the return that Usher had been waiting for. It's by far his second best album behind Confessions, and has a very similar vibe to Confessions. I've even gone as far as to say RVR is the poor mans Confessions. Its a much welcomed return to the old Usher that everyone loved... the wedding ring is off for sure on this album. And what helped this album the most was an upgrade in the production department, the biggest upgrade being in Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis as they basically built the foundation for this album with there stellar production. Usher really spent a lot of time on this album (evident by how many times this album leaked), and the final product may have its fair share of flaws, but at least this time the albums pro's out weigh its con's by a lot combining for Usher's best album since Confessions and my R&B album of 2010...                  Grade:  A-
B00001ODHJ|5.0|This movie was simply hilarious. It is definitely not for everyone's humor, but if you like cheesy horror films with corney catch phrases, you might love this movie. Bruce Cambell is hilarious in this film. He says things that are so corney, it manages to be hilarious. The costume artists did a great job... and it's also fairly entertaining when it comes to battle scenes and such. Personally, I loved this movie... I'd reccomend it for any cheesy horror film lovers out there... or for anyone who loves Bruce Cambell and somehow hasn't seen it.

B00005R24K|3.0|Fairly creepy at times, pretty funny at times, it was a decent movie. Before buying it, I had already seen Evil Dead 2 and 3... so without question I just bought this one for the complete trilogy. It doesn't compare to the 2nd and 3rd when it comes to laughs and entertaining scenes... but it definitely sets the foundation for the movies to come. It was funny at times, but wasn't intending to be... not that that necessarily matters. I think some of the aspects of the movie and the premise were pretty freaky, I just think the director didn't have a lot of money or something. Overall, I'd say this movie is worth seeing at least once. It's a classic, and definitely for Evil Dead fans.
1843432684|4.0|In \\"Kafka At The Shore\\" there is an interplay of many elements: metaphysical, spiritual, aesthetic, emotional.   There are beautiful sexual fantasies, and clinical descriptions of Kafka's penis.  Like a well constructed symphony, there is a great range of voices. The novel is nicely paced, and well plotted.  Murakami is adept at imagery, and does not hesitate to bring the metaphorical and impossible into the \\"real\\" world.     At the same time, the novel does not have the emotional impact that it might, given its subject of a teenager trying to surmount the effects of a childhood without love.  I also thought some parts could have been edited and tightened up such as the journey through the forest.
1400031567|3.0|American or English detective mysteries, it is weird to read about police in Sweden who seem to have very weak stomachs...the whole lot of them would be better off as social workers...the main detective is kind of a wimp and a little too in touch with his feminine side for my taste, but this is Sweden, where all are aghast at anything less than flowers and sunshine and happy children...they live in a dream world in this book and even the cops, or especially the cops, rather, are stunned by crime in general and mope around and get sick at the sight of bodies, etc...  Also the story just isn't that good...it is obvious to all but the brilliant detective who is murdering these people and why...  I think I will stick to myesteries set in countries that are a little more realistic about crime and violence...we would all like to live in a perfect society, but Sweden seems to block out the rest of the world, at least according to Mankell...
B002SF9YUM|5.0|Rob Pattinson did a wonderful job as Dali.     It encouraged in me an interest in exploring info on the famous painter.  I bought his book \\"The Secret Life of Salvador Dali\\" and got my youngest daughter to purchase some jewelry for me from the Salvador Dali website in St. Petersburg, Florida.   Dali was a complex individual with many issues but outstanding artistic creativity and originality..no one can touch his numerous art creations. I thought Rob Pattinson did an insightful job into relaying Dalis personality to the screen and it was especially sad when the famous \\"love\\" of his \\"left\\" his life.

To think that the people that are running these insitutions have any common sense is a grave mistake. Unfortunately  for the people that believe in the \\"ponzi\\" scheme of the stock market where a stock is worth $2.50 and gets bid up  to $60 a share based upon 10-50 times earnings. All based upon creative finacial paper work to beat the \\"analysis\\"  by \\"one penny\\". Thank God that we have naive people dumb enough to invest, and support our companies so they can  leverage the cheap money provided by the stock market.  This is a GREAT READ for any investor to see the nuts and bolts of the bottom up, instead of the top down.

B0036T31YY|5.0|Only this and 'Sherlock Holmes' were grabbing my interest on the new Video On Demand releases.  I was afraid this was going to be a slasher flick.  I'm so glad I picked 'Triangle'.  I haven't been this freaked out by a movie in a long time.  There's truly some memorable scenes and one that gave me goose bumps towards the end.  Superb directing, the atmosphere was just fantastic.  Melissa George really showed her acting potential here, although I only have one other movie to compare to.  And I'm like, who are these other actors?  Surely one of them is going to completely bring the movie down in some way.  Absolutely not.  Solid acting all around.  If you dig 'Twilight Zone' or just like freaky movies that make you think afterwards, you can't go wrong with this gem.

0545123267|5.0|This book begs comparisons to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series, mainly in that it centers around a teenage romance between a young woman and a storybook creature (in this case, a werewolf).  Like Twilight, it's also set in a small town, and clueless parents and adults facilitate these teens having much more independence than any real-life teens I know.<br /><br />Beyond the obvious similarities, though, I think this book is different than Twilight in the most important ways.  First of all, the writing is SO much better.  It is as compulsively readable as Twilight, but instead of leaving an uncomfortably laughable aftertaste, Stiefvater's lyrical prose brings a credible weight to the reading experience.  The storyline is also much more complex - the characters are given greater dimensions as you learn about their personal histories, and there are layers of story that add suspense and mystery and deeper emotion.<br /><br />Speaking of emotion, I think the number one difference between Shiver and Twilight is that the love story between Grace and Sam seems much more earnest.  It's not nearly as over-the-top, and there seems like a real investment of affection, and not just a random, nearly obsessive attraction.  There is still the uncomfortable matter of reading about teenage intimacy (I'm a mother of teens, and I prefer to remain happily ignorant about that, at least with my reading material), but Stiefvater handles that with great respect and a \\"less is more\\" approach in terms of details.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this book.  The writing is fantastic, the story is complex, the characters are diverse and compelling.  It was a lovely, solid read.  I was excited to learn that this is the first in a proposed trilogy, with the next novel - Linger - coming out this summer.  Movie rights for Shiver have also been purchased.

I thought I was going to be watching a sports movie, you know the kind that make you want to play football right then and there, but it was a very moving story. Sandra Bullock was great but while wathcing the movie I couldn't help call bs on a white family taking in a big black kid but then I saw the interview with the real Leigh Anne. She's an incredibly smart, sexy women and makes the story very believable.   this movie has some of the best extras I've ever seen.

B000F5FR0S|4.0|This is the second straight book from author Dennis Lehane with new lead characters. Here we find U.S.Marshalls, Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule, taking a ferry from Boston to a hideous looking place known as Shutter Island which houses the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane.<br /><br />After a bumpy ride on the boat that finds Teddy puking up, the two are met at the dock by Deputy Warden Mcpherson, flanked by orderlies, mostly Negroes and a few white guys with deadened faces. They are told this is a maximum security institution and unmonitored contact with patients is forbidden.<br /><br />While on an island tour of the facilities they spot a tower and are told falsely it is an old, abandoned light house, but later find out something quite different; for Mcpherson and the evil Dr. Cawley, who is in charge of the institution, want the marshalls to only see places prepared by them in advance, and then get off the island before they discover what is really going on. At least that is the reader's early impression.<br /><br />A patient, Rachel Solando, who is suspected of killing her three children turns up missing from her room. It is a mystery how this could happen. The marshalls begin their investigation. Chuck and Teddy go to a graveyard on site and stumble onto a mysterious mausoleum.<br /><br />They later find out the real activity on the island is using human beings as guinea pigs--giving hallucinogens to schizophrenics; then performing transorbital lobotomy to calm them down.<br /><br />During Teddy's investigative stroll about the island he finds Racheal Solando living in a cave after escaping from Dr. Cawley's insane methods of experimentation. There is much thrilling suspense to follow. As with all mysteries if I told you everything you wouldn't have to read it. The book will hold your interest and for fans of Lehane used to Angela Gennaro and Patrick Kenzie's detective prowess solving crimes, you will also find the book worth your time.

B003A9OVS0|2.0|I like some of the songs in this album but others are like transitioning from smooth polished floor to a sandpaper covered floor.  the songs that bug me most are: \\"welcome to the world of plastic beach\\", \\"white flag\\" and \\"Super fast jellyfish\\".  Each has a smooth rolling musical rhythm that gets severely tripped up by a poor attempt by rappers to fit their words into a section of a song where they simply will not fit.     Super fast Jellyfish is the best example of this where the song is gliding along really fast, has a great snappy tune to it and then the rapper tries to get too many words into one measure of the song. I feel like I hit a section of sandpaper on the floor and I have to struggle to regain my feet.     I have all the Gorillaz albums and after listening to this one for a few weeks now... this one is definitely the worst.  Better to buy some of the tracks than the whole thing here.  Best tracks in my opinion are \\"Sytlo\\", \\"Sweepstakes\\", \\"Plastic beach\\", \\"to Binge\\" and \\"Pirate jet\\".
031606792X|5.0|I know a lot of people did not like this book. I have read so many love stories where it ends and a price was paid for love. Someone you care about in the story dies or ends up heartbroken. How wonderful it was for me to invest the time in these four books and have a smile on my face when I closed the final book. I know there is more drama when it is written dark and sad but for me this was a kind fate for the \\"people\\" I had followed and enjoyed for so many months.      If you want Bella to suffer, Jacob to die and Edward to pay for what he wanted then I am sorry you will not like this book. As for me, there is enough pain and darkness in life. I am thankful to Ms. Meyer for allowing us a happy ending.     As for her not giving us enough details on who wore what and what things looked like, I have read all these books and in my mind \\"see\\" Bella's wedding dress and I \\"see\\" how the Cullen's house looks. If you need her to write every detail out for you I suggest you wait for the movie.

B00000DC10|5.0|\\"Rather be forgotten then remembered for giving in\\" or so Refused frontman Dennis Lyxz&eacute;n states on \\"Summerholidays vs. Punkroutine.\\" While the Swedish hardcore/punk outfit certainly haven't been forgotten, they will always be remembered for doing the exact opposite of giving in when they broke up on the brink of their mainstream breakout with this revolutionary little piece of music, \\"The Shape of Punk to Come: A Chimerical Bombation in 12 Bursts.\\"<br /><br />Forgoing the punk aesthetic that had infested mainstream radio throughout the 1990's, Refused's third and final album is a revolt against not only a genre that had cannibalized itself, but also against modern culture and our class system. While it may be a hard pill to swallow for the listener who prefers his meat and potatoes punk rock, \\"The Shape of Punk to Come\\" is about as punk as punk can get in form and function. Challenging the listener not with just a powerful message but with a barrage of sounds and textures as well is perhaps the best way to start a musical revolution and command attention. To that end alone, the album is a success.<br /><br /> Serving as the backdrop to Refused's revolution are efficient blasts of tough-as-nails hardcore fused with electronica, drum and bass and even a bit of jazz here and there.  While Lyxz&eacute;n barks, shrieks and howls his way through the bulk of the 12 song set, the music behind him is constantly shifting, never lingering long enough for a catchy riff or a drum-beat to get stale. The album opener, \\"Worms of the Senses,\\" has enough good ideas to stretch into a simpler album, but for every moment of manic inspiration, there are moments where things gel to create a truly potent and definitive statement, thus, the album's key-track and easily the band's most well-known song, \\"New Noise.\\"<br /><br />While rumors of Refused re-uniting currently persist, one only needs to reference track nine to find an ultimate answer. Had the band stuck around and worn out their welcome, they would have rendered their point moot, and while it's a shame that more music of this nature was never produced, the band's legacy lives on in the spirit of countless bands -- for better or for worse -- who took inspiration from this album. In a nutshell, this album is unlike anything else that arrived on the scene in 1998, and to date, has yet to get stale or tired. Even in 2010, is still makes for one heck of an invigorating and refreshing listen. If this album isn't in any music lover's collection, it's not yet complete.ed their point moot, and while it's a shame that more music of this nature was never produced, the band's legacy lives on in the spirit of countless bands -- for better or for worse -- who took inspiration from this album.

I.E: frostbitten fingers turned black immediately after exposure and had to be amputated, while faces exposed to much longer periods of cold weren't white, red or even chapped. Hey, anyone out there tried to even move their lips after coming in from extreme cold? Guess we wouldn't want to miss any of that brilliant dialogue. ..
B001F7AP5C|5.0|A riveting, and utterly devastating examination of a man who was, unfortunate for many, one of the most consequential people of the 20th century. Mao Zedong is stripped bare of all common propaganda myths, and a startlingly different person is seen.   We are introduced to a cynical, cold, uncaring, ruthless, and utterly hypocritical egotist, who blackmailed, cheated and terrorized his way into power.   Early understanding of his previous positions and writings reveal very little infinity for the ideology he would later enforce on China, showing contempt to the idea of collectivization. Mao is revealed to have cared very little for the peasant class he claimed to have championed, and privately viewed them with disdain.   His early experiences as a communist leader reveal a ruthless double crosser who, though dependent on support from Moscow, frequently broke party rules, and retained prominence in the party through intimidation and fraud. Of particular note is his blackmailing of Zhou En Lai through a false ideological recantation that Mao would hold against Zhou throughout their parallel careers.   We learn that Mao began the purging of political opponents while communists only held regional power in China, employing brutal medieval methods of torture before even Stalin had begun his own great purges.   The Long March is exposed as a propaganda piece, and the escape from annihilation revealed as Chiang Kai Shek's unwillingness to attack the Reds due to Moscow holding his own son hostage. The famous crossing of the Dadu River is confirmed as a remarkably easy operation, and echoed decades later in a conversation between Deng Xiaoping and Zbigniew Brzinski.   Perhaps most damaging to the cult of Mao, and Chinese nationalism in general, is his welcoming of Japanese occupation of China. Mao took this as nothing more than a convenient diversion from Chiang Kai Shek, and is revealed to have been privately thankful to the Japanese. Virtually little fighting took place against the Japanese, and any intention is believed to have been sheer propaganda. His focus remained the defeat of the Nationalist, and the Japanese were of no concern.   His rule is characterized as having little other interest other than advancing China's power on the world stage. He is shown to care little for the good of the people, effectively creating a slave society wherein people were slave driven toward his goal of establishing China as a superpower.   The Great Leap Forward is revealed as a grotesque economic mismanagement where the entire energies of the country were concentrated in a disastrous economic advancement program that caused the worst famine in history, all the while China was contributing more foreign aid per capita than any other nation.   The Cultural Revolution, a period Mao apologists attribute to the Gang of Four, was initially a mutual agreement between Mao and Lin to purge their respective rivals, and extended through the machinations of Mme Mao into an assault on all Chinese culture. The regime that rules China soon denounced this bizarre period of anarchy, yet remain reluctant to denounce its perpetrator.   His life, as deplorable as it is, was many ways an unhappy one, riddled with insecurity, constantly fearing plots, coups, a life devoted to the lust of power, and bereft of friendship.   Were it not for the fact that Mao was a power hungry hypocrite responsible for more deaths than Hitler and Stalin, he would almost be a figure of pity. And it is indeed a situation, to be both pitied and despised, that the regime that still rules China to this day further devalues its already devalued currency with Mao's image.   A devastating and compelling book, and one that should be read by every student radical sporting a Mao shirt. The most explosive, reality shattering political biography ever.
B002UJIY7A|1.0|I am someone who has seen enough movies and pays attention to what is going on that I frequently pick up on the shot that doesn't quite belong, the cut-away at an unnatural point, odd phrasings, ...  If you are this sort of person, there is no suspense in this movie: Almost from the very beginning, I suspected what the twist was, by about 10 minutes in I was reasonably certain, and at 17:35 it was effectively confirmed (Director's Cut times).  Until the \\"twist\\" was explicitly revealed, there was such a continuing barrage of these hints that people like me have problems understanding how others could have missed all of them (and I have friends in that category).  My objection is _not_ that the movie gives you hints of the twist--I would be upset if it gave none (cheating)--but rather that there should have been only enough to create the ambiguity that creates suspense.<br /><br />When the \\"twist\\" is explicitly revealed, there is a _long_ \\"intermission\\" (in B/W) that may end the movie for you (I did email waiting for the story to resume).  This slow-paced interruption enumerates details no longer important or of interest (relative to the movie experience) plus a tedious tangent.<br /><br />Even if you aren't one who spotted the twist, you may well find the attempt to build suspense to be so ham-handed that it has no emotional impact.  All the characters in the three couples are \\"off\\" enough, often in unbelievable ways, that not only did I not have any empathy for any of them--necessary for suspense--but I disliked them enough that I found myself half-hoping that they would be killed early on.  However, because of my age (50s) and nature, I am a harder \\"sell\\" than most for establishing empathy.<br /><br />Good suspense movies work despite their (inevitable) logical holes because the pacing keeps your from noticing them or pursuing them, or it keeps you so emotionally involved that you willingly accept them.  Here, the pacing is labored and so erratic/uneven that it never approaches the necessary momentum.<br /><br />If you have seen more than a few thriller movies in your life, you will see nothing new here, and those retread \\"thrills\\" are prosaic, predictable and telegraphed well in advance.  Some of the attempts to build tension were so badly executed that they do the opposite.  Mistakes and misinterpretations are expected, but when the script makes character(s) \\"too stupid to live\\" and tries to build tension by stretching out those segments expecting me to empathize with such characters, the movie instead alienates me.  At the end, I was rooting for the police to shoot the couple being stalked, which would have had the added benefit of being an interesting minor twist of letting the serial killers escape detection (as the lesser evil/idiots).<br /><br />This movie inconceivably fails to capture even a small fraction of the beauty of its location (based on std DVD), although there are a few shots showing the potential.  Even an amateur has difficulty not taking breath-taking pictures (personal experience). Good cinematography could have offset a legion of failings.<br /><br />For Milla Jovovich fans, be aware that a substantial portion of her close-ups are in the B/W segment, something that should get the director a lifetime ban.  And there is only a fleeting bit with her as action star.<br /><br />Aside: Indicative of how little attention was paid to the script, the \\"hard to kill\\" character claims he survived the Sioux Falls DC-10 crash (UA 232) because of \\"situational awareness\\". That crash is ancient history (1989) for both the character and the audience, and it was luck--where you were seated--that determined who survived.  It would have taken the writers only a brief visit to Wikipedia to find a suitable update to maintain the ambiguity about the character's claims and whether the others should believe them.<br /><br />And what confirmed the \\"twist\\" to me was a reference to a 1994 event, although being so dated was part ofwhat made it more than just a hint.
B00337KM2S|5.0|After I saw this movie at the theatre, I knew exactly who I wanted to send it to.  When I tried to order on Amazon.com I discovered that the official release date was a few weeks into the future.   So, I entered a Pre-order, and LO! The movie arrived at my friend's house on the EXACT release date.  My friend had my gift before he could even get to the video store.   WONDERFUL!   Thank you Amazon for being so reliable.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|\\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" could - and should - have been a much better film than it is.  It starts out promisingly enough, with Gerard Butler playing a family man who is stabbed and whose wife and daughter are butchered during a dramatic home invasion and robbery.  Enter Jamie Foxx as the ambitious Philadelphia prosecutor who is more concerned with preserving his conviction rate that with serving justice.  Without Butler's consent, Foxx accepts a plea bargain from the actual murderer in exchange for the killer's (false) testimony against his partner in crime.<br /><br />Flash forward ten years later.  The condemned man's execution doesn't go as planned, and the actual murderer is brutally butchered.  All leads point to Butler, who is apprehended and imprisoned on suspicion of taking the law into his own hands.  Butler even confesses.  But during his incarceration, other people who were involved in the decade-old case also begin to die in gruesome fashion.  Foxx, who has worked his way up in the D.A.'s office, soon catches on that Butler is wreaking his revenge from behind bars.  But who is helping him?  And why?  And how?<br /><br />It's at this critical point that the movie begins to fall apart, and the plot unravels.  It begins to be easy to tell who the next character to die is going to be (once you question the wisdom of Foxx's original bargain, you are very likely toast), and holes in the story begin to widen into canyons.  The film finally begins to collapse under the weight of its own moral ambiguity.  At the end of this basically two-character movie, neither Butler nor Foxx truly has been redeemed ... one's life continues and one's life ends, but the resolution is emotionally unsatisfactory, leaving the audience feeling cheated, its sympathies thwarted.<br /><br />\\"Law Abiding Citizen\\" features some bravura acting by Gerard Butler, a smooth performance by Jamie Foxx, and some excellent supporting turns by Viola Davis, Annie Corley, Bruce McGill, and Leslie Bibb.  It also has some spectacular action sequences, and moments of genuine suspense.  However, all these fine components cannot hide the inadequacies of Kurt Wimmer's script, which are not overcome by F. Gary Gray's direction.  An interesting failure. ** ½ starsacular action sequences, and moments of genuine suspense.

B0037AGASG|5.0|This album does NOT deserve the hate is has gotten so far! Is it specific to a particular audience? Yes. But take on look at the kid and you'll see that everything about him is specific to a his target audience of little girls. If you are looking for an album to remember for the rest of your life..look elsewhere. -- If you have realistic expectations for a 16 year old kid singing pop music, you'll enjoy this.
B002S0OBN2|2.0|I got this cast recording the day it came out, hoping to recreate at the earliest moment the unbelievable thrill I derived from listening to The Phantom of the Opera for the very first time. Well, \\"Love Never Dies\\" is just OK. The only memorable melody it seems is \\"Love Never Dies\\", which was first introduced at the ALW Royal Albert Hall Celebration (Dame Kiri's unforgettable \\"The Heart is Slow to Learn\\") and later loaned to \\"The Beautiful Game\\" (\\"Our Kind Of Love\\"). Did anyone notice some melodies were recycled from \\"Sunset Boulevard\\"? Try finding them.  I read they're already expecting rewrites for the Broadway version.

0670021652|2.0|My book club thought this would be a fun, light read over spring break. We all liked Eat, Pray, Love and were excited to read Committed. I'm sorry to report that I could not even bring myself to read all of it-something that rarely happens to me. Did anyone edit this book? It was incredibly boring and repetitive and I became increasingly irritated by her self-absorbed comments. Very disappointing.

I had my 3 month blood work done last week for my Type 2 Diabetes and everything was excellent:blood sugar, cholesterol levels etc. My doctor said to keep doing what I've been doing, Atkins and exercise. I highly recommend the book.
0061922315|5.0|A beautifully written tale of two families - a tale of love, loss, fear, courage, insecurity, injustice, privilege, poverty, marriage and parenthood.  Remarkably, it covers all these topics with brilliant insight.  Without ever hitting a single manipulative note, the writer creates an incredibly emotional story.  True and authentic.  It was one of those books that I HATED to finish because there is no more.

B000K1P66W|5.0|I have been going through some emotional battles that have built up over the years following a divorce and an ongoing custody battle.  I broke down and went and seen a psychologist and she suggested that I read this book.  Now mind you I've tried little things here and there and the anger just kept building up so I figured what they heck, I'll buy it and see what it's all about.    All I can say about this book is wow, simply amazing.  After reading it I've become 'obsessed' about reading more of Don Miguel Ruiz's books!  I've gone on to purchase the Master of Knowledge and the Master of Love.  I want to read the Fifth Agreement but it's only found in hardback at the moment.      This book will move you.  It will make you open up to your thoughts.  Everyone raved about The Secret but really should be raving about this book!!  I am forever changed and have realized that I need to have more self respect and more confidence and once I have those the rest will fall into place.    I suggest anyone going through a trying time to read this book, no matter what the situation it will put things into perspective for you and will give you a brand new joyous outcome on life
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. I really liked that it had a special insert that wasn't available in stores. Since she saw the movie she really liked the CD. Her 3 year old daughter already has learned and loves the songs too!
B000TRY39I|5.0|I love the book.  It makes so much sense and it's easy reading.  David Schwartz uses common sense examples that people relate to.  We are a product of our own belief system.  As Henry Ford said, \\"If you believe you CAN, or you believe you CAN'T...you're right.\\"
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|You cannot beat this lav mike! It took me a long time to find an inexpensive mic like this that would work with my Canon camcorder, but this baby fits the bill nicely.

0393072231|5.0|The financial meltdown; what really happened, why it happened and who's to blame.  Michael Lewis explains it all in a very understandable way so that laypeople should understand our current financial situation.  Michael uses the stories of the few who saw it coming as a way to trace the origins of what happened and how it happened.  Well written, a fast page-turner read, and before I finished it, I decided to order Liar's Poker as I liked this book so much.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I've enjoyed the music from these movies from the first time I went, but this CD was the collection that really summed up the feeling.  At my age (no, I'm not telling)I'm almost embarrassed to admit I go to Harry Potter movies, but I find I can just get lost in the stories, and remember the lure of magic when I was a child.    Start with this one and see if you want to go further.
B002R5V7MG|5.0|Best performance of the Mahler 1st Symphony I've heard. That symphony is my favorite, so I have several recordings of it.(Some I can't play anymore as I didn't replace my last ten-inch 1/4-track tape machine when it died and my SACD and DVD-Audio player when it succumbed, also. While the OPPO combo Blu-ray/SACD/CD/DVD/DVD-Audio player looks interesting I think I'll wait until it can play the new 3D Blu-ray discs. If that means I have to replace my projector, so be it.)     The other works on this Dudamel disc are interesting but not nearly as powerful as the Mahler. Dudamel treats his body as another instrument for our enjoyment. Five stars . . . or is that five Yums!
B00006ZXSK|4.0|I like this movie because it portrays Cinderella as an intelligent girl who is only kept \\"down\\" in life by the people in power around her.  However, the strong people who see who she really is help her to become the leader she was meant to be.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|I read a lot of reviews on this product and other headsets as well and decided that for the price I would take a chance on this one.  I play specifically MW2 on the PS3.    I will address to two biggest complaints that I read about first.  (1)  Background noise or hissing, etc - I noticed this sound when I was setting up the headset and had zero sound output from the tv or game.  Once I was playing or watching a movie it was gone.  So for me it was a non issue and it sounded like the white noise you hear in large office buildings.  (2)  Cords - The cord is 16' feet long, which was just the right size for me to get to my chair and have enough room that I was able to set the sound remote in my lap.  I have a 52\\" widescreen.  One end goes into one of the controller ports and then you have three connections, one to the headset, and two to the yellow/red on your TV/Stereo.  It has a jumper that attaches to the TV and then you attach the ps3 yellow and red into the back of the headset yellow/red.  Similar instructions if you are running HDMI.  Either way the cords are out of sight to the back of the TV and not an issue for me.    Now for the good stuff - the remote (in line) is great, you can control the game, mic, other people's mic's, base, etc with the touch of a button.  Directional sound is great; I can hear people coming from all directions.  It took a little getting used and I died a few more times than normal because I was looking around, hmm that sounds like it is behind me is some really coming from behind me, turn, look, bang I was shot dead.  Some of the sounds I hear on the headset I am still trying to figure out, because you do hear things you don't normally hear.  Once I got that hang of it, and reacting with purpose instead of trying to confirm what I was hearing it was much better.  Comfort, the cups fit fine, I was a little sore at first but once I got everything into position, everything was fine.  In between games I rest them on my shoulders as they are made to do.  These have been great and the only unknown for me is how long they last.    So for the price, $70-$80, I think these are perfect for those that want quality sound but don't want to shell out $150+ for some of the top models out there.  Also it says this works for the Xbox and has an xbox cord included.
B001QOGYBI|3.0|This is a cute movie, great for kids and families. However, I found the animation very distracting.<br /><br />I realize stop-frame (model) animation is nearly as challenging as drawn animation, and I admire anyone who takes it on. But for a big-budget, professional production, I found the animation so distractingly unlifelike I couldn't relax and enjoy the story.<br /><br />And is it just my imagination, or did they use a lower animation framerate (number of frames per second) than usual, to limit production costs? That would account for some of the jerkiness, though not all of it.<br /><br />(By contrast, the characters in the \\"Wallace and Gromit\\" features are much less sophisticated, yet they're so well-animated I have no trouble suspending my disbelief and enjoying them.)<br /><br />As if that weren't distracting enough, these characters are covered with fur. Even when the they do nothing but speak, this fur is always shifting here and there from the animators' adjustments. Maybe there's no way to avoid that, but it was another constant reminder that I was watching models, not \\"living\\" characters.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I have seen the first two in this series in both the Attenborough and Oprah narrations.  The Attenborough version is, of course, the better of the two.<br />While there is a general idea (at least among American anti-intellectuals) that scientists are boring, uptight, fuddy-duddies, the truth is that the well-educated  populizers of science, such as Attenborough, still hold a very dear place in the hearts of a very large group of people in America who have not yet gone bat guano crazy.  The reason why a man like Sir David Attenborough is so well esteemed among enthusiasts of nature documentary, whereas Oprah Winfrey is not, is because when one devotes their entire life to the understanding of a certain topic they are able to bring a wonder-filled enthusiasm, backed by a substantial knowledge, to that topic.  Most of us are not looking for a \\"Wow...Look...nature is cool!\\" sort of commentary.  We already understand that.  We wish for someone to fill us with the wonder of understanding.  The only thing that separates humankind from the animals in these documentaries is that we are truly *thinking* about them.  Why stare, slack-jawed, as if nature were a train wreck while ludicrously under-qualified talk show hosts point and extrapolate the obvious when we can spend that time in awe while actually learning? This documentary is one of the finest ever made, but only the BBC version is worth consideration.

B003ELOQD4|5.0|Hands down, one of the best performances I've ever seen.  I've been to 4 U2 concerts now, and by dumb luck, we made it to the inner circle.  We saw U2 at Cowboy's Stadium, in and of itself, impressive.  Glad to see it is finally here.  If this captures half the excitement I whitened first hand, I would say it is well worth the purchase.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|If I could've given this waste of time negative stars, I would've given it about a negative 10. This film is unbelievable from start to finish (Mythbusters could do about 5 shows on it), unscientific (they just make stuff up as they go along) and beyond ridiculous (the scene with the Arks is beyond words). Some disaster movies are enjoyable to watch, not because of believability, but for entertainment value. This is not one of those movies. I actually found myself cheering for the disasters to kill off the main characters so the real horrors would end, but it was not to be. If only the bridge would've fallen faster, or the earth could've opened wider, or if the ice was harder, but no such luck for us the tortured viewer. It's supposed to be based on the belief of the Mayan calendar and that the world will end on Dec. 31st, 2012, which in itself is up for debate, but I'd rather hear that than have to sit through a second of this abomination to film.    If there was a \\"movie\\" to skip watching for all of eternity, this would be it. All of the fancy, special CGI gimmicks in the world can't make a movie this horrible watchable. If you want to see a disaster movie, watch \\"The Towering Inferno,\\" or \\"The Poseidon Adventure.\\"
B00024I2Z4|4.0|Happy with my purchase.  As good as the movie I remember seeing in the theatre.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|The seller was unresponsive to my email & this is a recurrence among other buyers.  He uses USPS and if it doesn't ship on time (or at all, in my case), he blames it on the mail carrier.  I suggested that he use an alternative company based on my experience & the reviews that he received.  I ordered this a month ago & it's been over a month without a response.  I suggest paying with a credit card & having a buffer where you would be able to obtain a refund.   I would be open to writing an honest response if he takes the time to look into this issue and resolve it in a fair manner.
0061730327|5.0|The book wasn't what I expected.  Although it was a remarkable tale of a boy's success in constructing a windmill to produce electricity in an impoverished African village, the accounting of his thirst for education, the extreme poverty in the area, the famine that killed many and the Malawi government's corrupt indifference to the suffering of its citizens appalled me.  In the face of starvation and lack of schooling, the boy succeeded.  The book should be required reading for all American high school students.  Perhaps then they would appreciate having a free education,a full stomach, decent clothing and shelter.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|This is a spectacular suspense/horror movie everyone should see. It would lean slightly more to the suspense side than to the horror side, being based off of the video game. At the end it really makes you think about God and life. I would completely recommend this movie.
B0015519VS|5.0|I clearly must not be Usher's target audience, since everyone seemed to think this album sucked. I thought it was amazing. I personally liked it much better than Confessions and Raymond vs Raymond.
B000031EGV|3.0|This was a movie that I watched when I was a kid. I bought it remembering it as a good movie. While it is still a good movie, it was not as good as I remembered. If you have never seen it, it's worth at least watching it once, and if you have seen it before, I'd say it would be worth adding it to your movie collection even though it's not among the best movie made.
B002MRROKS|5.0|Nirvana's \\"Live at Reading\\" is just another reminder of how talented Nirvana was. I am a huge Nirvana fan and this live CD does not disappoint. I loved about half the songs on this CD before I bought it, and then once I listened to this CD I fell in love with every song on it. Kurt Cobain's voice sounds even more amazing live. Overall this is a masterpiece that helps us re-live the historic performance.

B000002OX7|5.0|There's an old saying that advises us to aim for the stars at all times.  The idea is that by doing so, even a failure might land you on the moon, at least.  Here's an example of that idea in action - \\"Who's Next\\" is without a doubt one of the most magnificent records in the magnificent career of the Who, and yet it's really just the debris of a Pete Townshend project that collapsed under its own weight.<br /><br />Fans of this band already know that in the years after \\"Tommy\\", Townshend as the group's main songwriter looked around for something to top it.  This was a process doomed to failure, of course, but even considering that, the plan he came up with was unwieldy at best; he wanted to put together a multi-media event called \\"Lifehouse\\" that would include live performance, taped music and video, and some sort of worldwide audience-participation computer scenario.  Maybe his best idea was the notion to use the setup as the structure for a story about a totalitarian, computer-controlled state that has outlawed music because it's a revolutionary force, and a man who finds an electric guitar and touches off a rebellion.  Not a bad plotline, especially for a delivery system that seeks to join the audience into a single entity in partnership with the composer.  As for the presentation, however, it looks like Pete Townshend anticipated the internet twenty years early, and the audience participation stuff is only just starting to come online now.  No wonder it fell apart in 1971.  In a piece of interview footage, Roger Daltrey sighs \\"Pete couldn't explain it to us very well.\\"<br /><br />This would be frustrating for any creative person trying to work with a set of partners.  For Townshend it must have been excruciating - he had written some of his best work in anticipation of this project, and discovered an exciting new approach to his craft in early synthesizer technology.  No way he was going to toss it.  So he took the Who into the studio with a new producer and shook it all down into a single album.<br /><br />This band was always very good at big sounds, but \\"Who's Next\\" is a whole new level.  The sonic bed echoes like the vault of that stormy sky on the cover.  Whoever decided to kick off the record with Daltrey bellowing \\"Out here in the fields / I fight for my meals / I get my back into my living\\" had the right idea - it's definitely the perfect sentiment for the sound.  In fact, the whole album is one of the best matches of sound to theme that rock has produced.<br /><br />Any band that's played together as long as the Who had by 1971 gets pretty good at the kind of semi-psychic blend that's any musician's dream, but it's particularly in evidence on \\"Who's Next\\" - many of the songs have long instrumental breaks at the close that show the guitar, bass and drums swirling around each other in a kind of diamond-hard latticework, and even Daltrey's tambourine contributes its share.  While that's going on, the lyrics speak of the tug of war between the need for independence and the need for community.  On the one hand you have those opening lines quoted above, and a little while later Daltrey begs \\"If I shiver, please give me a blanket.\\"  If \\"Lifehouse\\" intended to explore the struggle between tyranny and a community of individuals, \\"Who's Next\\" does so in a much simpler format.<br /><br />The only exception to that theme is \\"My Wife,\\" John Entwistle's sole offering.  He was one of the world's great bass players, but he was also a skillful songwriter, and people tended to expect something bizarre from him since \\"Boris the Spider\\" a few years earlier.  Sure enough, \\"My Wife\\" describes a man running from his spouse, who thinks he's been unfaithful, and he's convinced she's actually going to murder him.  No community here.<br /><br />Then the album closes with one of the most cynical meditations on community ever produced in \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\".  It concludes with the comforting declaration, \\"Meet the new boss / The same asthe old boss\\", the instrumentalists conclude not with a bang but a whimper, and the album is over.  Yet even here there's a sense of belonging - that shimmering sound and musical mindreading make sure of that.  And at the climax, as Dave Marsh once said, Daltrey emits a scream that transcends all doubt.  As usual with the Who, you get a little bit of everything and you have to figure it out for yourself.  Which may partly explain why the band lasted so long - they needed that time to get it all in.<br /><br />It's ironic that so many of these numbers turned into FM radio staples when the whole piece is all about resisting the ordinary way of doing things, but that's rock music for you.  The Who and Pete Townshend always swam against the tide anyway, playing at destructive volumes and destroying instruments and writing rock operas and things like that.  Check out that cover photograph again, for Heaven's sake - Townshend once said that it was intended to show the Who defacing that monolith from \\"2001\\", since \\"Lifehouse\\" could have been the rock equivalent of that visionary movie, but no one seemed to notice.  Makes sense in context.  \\"Lifehouse\\" warned against looking to anything but humanity for help, and \\"Who's Next\\" does the same.  1971 was a hard year for the Who, but they looked to each other and came up with a classic.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Your friends will drive you crazy - that's one of the things that makes them your friends.with a bang but a whimper, and the album is over.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a hauntingly beautiful series that confirms that Tom Brokaw got it right when he tagged my parents' generation as \\"the greatest generation\\".  Recommended viewing for all.  It recounts the horror of war; the sacrifices of our men (and now women) in uniform; and the atrocities that we humans can commit against one another.
B0032KNA4I|4.0|The plot is wildly improbable, the acting is marginal, but none of that matters. The effects are blow-you-away stunning, and even more so on blue-ray. So if you're like most guys (like the big budget special effects and don't like wasting time on things like plot and character development), this is definitely a good buy.

B002SJIO5E|1.0|DON'T SEE HOW THIS MADE THE TOP 10 FOR 2009. WE KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO EMPROVE !!!!~ WHAT A WAIST OF MONEY & TIME. JUST GLADE WE DIDN'T GO TO A THEATER TO SEE IT.
0571200583|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book once I saw the incredible comments about it: \\"brilliant\\", \\"amazing\\", \\"a dazzling achievement\\", \\"a new departure for the American novel\\". But what a waste of money... Not only was the book dull and obvious, but it was also pretentious. Do not expect to find anything similar to a mistery novel or even a detective story. It's about a writer (yes, so original) who clearly doesn't know what to do with his life. So, he decides that pretending to be a detective is a good way of spending his time.
B0000640VO|5.0|I truly love love this movie! Every time I see it I feel uplifted no matter what kind of day I had. Vive Amelie Poulain!!
B002VECMAE|5.0|I adore this movie. I've spoken to others who agree that you either love it or think, \\"Meh, could've been better,\\" or \\"I didn't get it.\\"     My husband and I saw this in the theater and laughed and laughed throughout, later agreeing that neither of us had ever enjoyed a movie better. We walked in with no expectations and walked away in very high spirits.    On a side note, I agree with an earlier reviewer comparing this to a Bill Murray movie (not that there is any need to make comparisons, but I think its in line with that sort of humor).
B00001QEE9|3.0|I tried to watch this movie with my son who is four-and-a-half. I really enjoyed it and he really enjoyed meeting Jimminy Cricket and seeing Pinnochio come alive. But when the villains entered the scene he started getting anxious, but could handle the first batch: the wily fox with companion, and the exploitative Stramboli. But then someone even more evil came on the scene who scared evil the nasty fox. When this evil character started talking about kidnapping little boys and taking them away from their mommies and daddies to an island far away, he freaked out. He wanted me to turn it off and, today, the day after, he still refuses to watch anymore. Based on this, I would have to agree with what some of the parents have written here in other reviews: it's too dark for some children. Full disclosure: my son is a sensitive sort and we don't let him watch regular TV where he would no doubt be exposed to \\"gratuitous violence\\" (which is really a euphemism for murder, gun battles, bombs exploding, gruesome war scenes, etc.) I thought the movie was wonderful as a piece of animation, a piece of cinema, even a piece of art. But I give it 3 stars just to alert parents that this movie, like other Disney movies, is surprisingly dark considering it is supposed to be entertainment for the whole family.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Wonderful story that made my wife cry.  Too bad this movie never made it to the national movie theatre circuit.  If you love animals, you will love this movie.
0446569895|4.0|I can't believe that Ozzy Osbourne isn't dead. Seriously. After reading this book I was reminded of the old saying - \\"God looks after drunks, fools, and children\\". Given that Ozzy could, at times, accurately have been described as all three, it's clear that he has never been in any real danger.    Before reading this book, here is what I knew about Ozzy: he was in Black Sabbath (although they broke up long before I became musically aware), he bit the head off of a bat, Randy Rhodes was in his band and died young, he did a great duet with Lita Ford- \\"Close My Eyes\\" - in the 80's (after I had become musically aware), he and has family became huge stars on \\"The Osbournes\\" on MTV, it's really hard to understand him when he talks, and his wife Sharon is a judge on \\"America's Got Talent\\". After reading the book, I know a little more.    \\"I Am Ozzy\\" follows the life Ozzy from a boy in England through his rise to rock superstardom. He grew up very poor, and he tells of the trouble he had finding work and staying out of jail. (He relates that his first job in the music business was as a car horn tuner - although that didn't last very long). You get to follow along as Black Sabbath forms, almost breaks up, and ultimately becomes a success. After they fire Ozzy, you see Sharon help him become a successful solo act in his own right. You hear about biting the head off of a dove, and a bat (he says that bat was an accident). You see the tragic early death of Randy Rhodes, and the birth of Ozzy's kids. You of course live through \\"The Osbournes\\" and how much it changed all of their lives.    Throughout all of this, you see Ozzy's incredibly excessive drug and alcohol abuse. He's very honest about his struggles and his shortcomings. That what brings me to the crux of my feelings about this book. I watched Ozzy a lot on \\"The Osbournes\\". I, like so many others, came to see him as a kind of lovable, if flawed, anti-dad for the new millennium. In reading the book I kept looking for a tale of redemption that would validate my hope for Ozzy to be a good guy. He is a good guy, but I was left feeling that, more than anything, he was just a very lucky SOB who could have very easily died numerous times due to his own excess. He was regretful for many of the things that happened in his life, but I never felt like he completed the journey. He's sober now (mostly), and appears to have gotten his act together with the help of medical professionals. Still, I was left feeling like I had only watched 45 minutes of the \\"Behind the Music\\" and never got to the last \\"after the break\\" where Ozzy made his triumphant return and recognized the error in his ways.    Maybe I'm being too harsh. I enjoyed reading the book and will admit that I went back to listen to a few older Black Sabbath songs after reading about their genesis. It's hard not to hear Ozzy's voice when reading this book, so it was a fun read. Be warned - it's full of unrepentant sarcasm and scorn, heaps of profanity and sex, and bad parenting on a level hard to imagine. I learned a lot about Ozzy, but what I really want to know now is - how does Sharon feel about all that's happened? Now THAT'S a book that I would like to read.
0061537969|4.0|Enzo may be a dog but don't tell him that. Enzo is a human trapped in a dog's body. Enzo's owner is Denny. Denny is a race car driver. He has mastered the art of racing in the rain. Denny tells Enzo you have to imagination that you are walking on egg shells. Enzo loves Denny and enjoys watching Denny's video tapes of his races. What Enzo didn't like at first was Eve. Denny started dating her and they eventually got married. Come join Enzo as he shares about his family.<br /><br />The Art of Racing in the Rain is the second book I have read by Mr. Stein. I absolutely fell in love with this book. I am happy to report that it lives up to all the hype and good reviews and more. Enzo warmed my heart. The relationship he and Denny shared was priceless. I used to have a Yellow Labrador named Patriot, whom I would communicate with as if he was human and could understand every word I said to him. This book was very character driven and filled with lots of heart and emotions. I could not get enough of Enzo. It was nice having everything told through Enzo's eyes. My favorite part was when Denny took Enzo for a ride in his race car.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|Great price and nice transfer with lots of extras. Really like having both versions available and really enjoyed the audio commentary with Kevin Smith and Richard Kelly which seems to have been recorded before 'Southland Tales' was released. Richard Kelly almost gives too much info, but enjoyed it none the less.
0307454541|1.0|Put this thing in the same category as \\"The Davinci Code\\".<br />Absolute crap!<br />Totally predictable.<br />Totally banal.<br />Of course, I was reading a translation, but... nonetheless, very ordinary writing.<br />Very, very silly waste of time, money, and in my case, eyeballs!
B002VECM6S|3.0|I'll admit the movie was touching, and the story was interesting, but Sandra bullock put up against an actor like Kathy Bates just doesnt cut it. The movie was fine until she starts ranting around with her forced southern draw, after that its really just hard to take her seriously. I was a fan of her when she was cute and funny, but her more serious roles, notably Crash, and Premonition just left a bad taste in my mouth. Someone like Robin Williams is a genius and basically can tackle any roll you give him funny or serious. Drama just isn't Sandras thing, i know the movie doesnt revolve around her, but Big Mike is actually a better actor than her(for a drama) and he rarely speaks. So its pretty basic, and yes predictable as most have said, plus i'm not an underdog can rise to the top if he puts his mind to it kind of movie fan, just Rockys thats about it. When it comes to Good Will Hunting, Finding Forester, and even Rudy they just pretty much all try and achieve the same goal which gets monotonous. Also i'm not a football fan(just my local home teams), so thats another reason its not my thing. Not saying its horrid by any means, but in my opinion i just don't like that the cast or the story. Sorry to be the bad guy folks, but 3 stars for the people who do think its great. :)
0061719544|4.0|It was a well written, easy read. I thought it was funny and entertaining. An autobiography on how Craig got to where he is today. I think it helps to be familiar with Craig,I am a fan, but it certainly explains a few things! I think anyone would enjoy it.
B002VWONB2|5.0|This is moviemaking at it's finest, even though no one knew at the time (1944) that \\"Casablanca\\" was destined for greatness. The Blu-Ray presentation seems like the film had just been released and the transfer was done with care. A fun, over-the-top Warner Bros. cartoon, \\"Carrotblanca\\" is included as well as other features found on an earlier standard-def DVD release. The audio is cleared-up as well without changing the mono \\"roots\\" of the soundtrack.    I'm amazed how younger audiences ignore classic B&W films. A Nephew of mine once told me that he had never seen a movie NOT in color! They are missing out, but you don't have to. Get \\"Casablanca\\" Blu-Ray today.
B001HN6940|4.0|To kick things off with a personal note, lately I haven't been as into movies as I once had.   After Pirates 3 (At World's End) and Spiderman 3 debuted, I'd lost a lot interest in just 'enjoying' film for the excitement and then became severely critical when reviewing them.  Then along came this year (and when I refer to this year, I mean going back 12 months from today)  Films like Avatar, Shutter Island and (of course) Alice in Wonderland brought back my interest in engaging and enjoying films.    Alice in Wonderland, while obviously not possessing Avatar nor Shutter Island-like cinematic quality, it is still a 'very' enjoyable film for the visuals (absolutely pristine), the characters (excellently cast) and maybe, just maybe- the screenplay, which is scattered with funny bits throughout.  Johnny Depp is wonderful at his characterization as Tim Burton's take on the mad hatter, and Helen Boham Carter is... in her entirety- 'amazing' as the red queen (her shrieks--including the patented \\"Off with her head!\\"-- that will literally make the audience squirm in their seats).      Now, for those hoping to see an accurate take on Lewis Carroll's book, get that thought out of your heads- now.  This is nothing like the book, nor its follower \\"Through the Looking Glass\\".  To put it more accurately, it's a spin-off of the original storyline.    In this story, Alice (Mia Wasikowsk)  is 19, and is once again led back to 'Underland' (or Wonderland, as we know it better) to fight the Red Queen (Helen Boham Carter), who's bratty and spoiled tendancies have gone completely out of line since her last visit, which Alice does not remember.  She is joined by the classic bunch of Wonderland characters, including the White Rabbit (voiced Michael Sheen), Chesire Cat (Stephen Fry), the mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) as well as a bunch of other familiar faces.  After finding out she is the only one who can stop the queen's tyranny (which involves slaying the Jabberwocky--a monster about five timesher size) she finds herself fleeing from the queen's army, led by the persistent, blood-thirsty knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover), her destiny and even herself.  Soon finding out just merely running away is not the answer, and also bearing the consequences that come with it she eventually claims responsility, and faces off against her enemies, one by one.    Be warned, this isn't a five year old's Disney movie (meaning, it isn't like those princess films you put on for your five year old daughter).  It contains violence, severed heads floating in a moat (queen of hearts, what do you expect?), decapitation, gore, and even a scene of sexual harassment.   If you had to rate it accurately, its more like PG/PG13 borderline, instead of the PG rating it was bestowed with. So make sure your kid, nephew, niece, grandkid, whatever, is at least 8 years old, or failing that, very mature or (most likely in this era) completely desensitized.    Closing, Alice in Wonderland is a good film for anyone just looking for something to enjoy for fun, but for someone looking for a hard-core masterpiece or for something that will leave you thinking... look somewhere else.

B001NFNFNU|3.0|This movie is certainly well crafted and delivered, with the writers, director, actors, etc. all having done their jobs quite skillfully (with the exception of one minor actor).  We feel that we're watching real people experiencing real events in real situations, so the movie succeeds in that vital way.<br /><br />But the next question, and I think the more important one, is what kind of experience the story presented in this movie creates for us, the audience.  On this score, I really have some reservations.  True, we witness the unrelenting love of a mother, and we see some noble people passionately fight for justice and succeed to some extent.  The former reminds us to not take our children for granted and the latter helps restore our faith in humanity, so the movie can be uplifting in these ways.  But we also witness a mother losing her child, and the same fate turns out to befall many other parents, which hits very painfully close to home for those of us who are parents.  As if that's not bad enough, the way in which these parents lose their children is too chilling for words (instead, the movie has graphics which are even worse).  And to top it off, we see shameless corruption by the police and psychiatric wards which immediately reminded me of Foucalt's analysis of how power can be exerted by labeling troublesome people as deviants.<br /><br />For me, the bottom line is that, on balance, I found this movie far more chilling and depressing than uplifting, and I wish I hadn't even watched it.  Indeed, I now have to hope that the awful imagery the movie has implanted in my mind will fade with time.  Needless to say, despite the fact that this movie has garnered mostly favorable reviews, I can't recommend watching it.  It seems to me that the attraction is akin to why people are drawn to gawking at people mutilated and killed in car accidents, and that's just not the sort of thing that has ever appealed to me.
B00005A0V0|5.0|This has to be one of the best prog rock albums of the late 60's and early 70's, up there with In the Court of King Crimson, Nursery Cryme and Pawn Hearts. Caravan produced some colourful and innovative stuff on the first two albums, particularly Cecil Rons and Where but for Caravan would I? on the first, and the composite tracks with the long names (too lazy to repeat them!) on the second, but ITLOGAP really brought it all together. David Sinclair's luscious keyboards throughout (the solo in Winter Wine has got to be his best), and the light, whimsical (and at times  funny and sexy) lyrics on side one are the elements which make this a standout album. Above all that,however, it is  probably the consistent quality, flow and coherence from beginning to end that marks this out as Caravan's best album. The others have their peaks but this one is up there and stays there from the word go. In the Land of Grey and Pink only boy scouts stop to think, so just get hold of a copy and listen to it now!
B001OQCV2O|1.0|Only Hollywood and Roland Emmerich could put together something more ridiculous. This movie plays out with so many eyerolls and over-the-top ridiculousness that it was almost like Emmerich was making fun of the people who've allowed him to make high dollar bomb after high dollar bomb by going to his films like drones, continuously tricked by promotional campaigns and slam bam trailers. Puppets we are. Well, not me.<br /><br />The only reason I rented this, and I nearly cryed to take my last remaining $3 out of my wallet in order to do so, was because I'm a fan of Amanda Peet. I think she's charming as heck and I could watch her read the newspaper. Yet, she's sort of wasted here with nothing to do but raise her eyebrow every three minutes because something else ridiculous is happening outside their chosen vehicle.<br /><br />If you like your action movies ridiculous and unrealistic, then 2012 is for you. I don't. If you like to have your intelligence insulted with the excuse of, \\"Oh, it's just supposed to be fun.\\" then 2012 is for you.<br /><br />The movie is based on the fact that the Mayan calendar runs out in December, the year 2012. Fortelling a true fact, verified by many scientists that for an unknown amount of time, the galaxies rotation will leave us without the sun's power.<br /><br />So, Roland Emmerich, being the person he is, chose to do what he does best. Take hollywood and your money and imagine the most unfeasible special effect and catastrophic collapes and crumblings of national monuments that you could imagine and put them together in one 2 hour film with no story except... run... everything's falling apart. Get somewhere!<br /><br />There is no story, so here are some examples of ridiculousness: John Cusak's character Jackson Curtis, a writer, missed his calling. He should have been a stunt driver or Nascar stud because he drives, not a Porsche 911, but a stretch limo through some of the most ridiculous situations you can imagine. Including jumping a major break in the road. He also jumps a break in the road and crashes through the window of a building that has fallen over the road and of course drives through it and out the other side. Later in the movie, he does some driving magic with a WINNEBAGO. Somehow, he jumps a void created by an earthquake on a airplane runway.<br /><br />Then they fly an airplane beneath buildings crumblings and watch a subway train fly over their heads. There's a volcano that erupts and they drive the WINNEBAGO just out of reach of the lava as it spreads across the countryside... of course leading up to the most ridiculous car jump since... no, it's the most ridiculous car jump ever.<br /><br />Bottom line: Roland Emmerich once again suckers everyone out of their money and once again guarantees that he'll get another big budget funding for 2011. Thank god, the worlds ending in 2012 so, FINALLY, in 2013, we won't have to give up one of our precious summer movie slots to another Emmerich eye roller.s a break in the road and crashes through the window of a building that has fallen over the road and of course drives through it and out the other side.

345387336X|3.0|The author of the novel that inspired Blade Runner has got to be a genius, and Ubik cannot be representative. If you are new to Philip K. Dick, as I was, don't begin with this book.    There is only so much that can be said, if one is to avoid spoilers. But Ubik has two plots: one about telepaths and their opponents, telepathy-blockers, a number of them working for the agency run by the novel's main protagonist, and another about cold-pack, meaning not-quite-dead people in suspended animation, still dreaming and communicating with the outside world. The first plot is pursued for about one third of the novel, then to all intents and purposes abandoned as the second one kicks in. Ubik is clunky and awkward, with hasty portrayal and often corny dialogue, perhaps reflecting the lack of direction. It is too full of red herrings and loose ends, in particular concerning Pat, the girl on the cover of this edition. I won't give up on Philip K. Dick. But this novel seems to me for established fans.
0307408833|1.0|Truly disappointing.  Beautifully photographed - even had the select celebrities make their appearances.  It was even promoted on Martha Stewart!  I ordered all the specialty ingredients from their on line recommendations - put the ingredients together after following the recipes to a tee.  After 4 expensive and failed attempts at having anything work - I gave up.  The recipes turned out overly dense and mushy.  With one recipe - the baking time of the Lemon Poppy Seed Cake called for 35 minutes - well - 75 minutes later it was still goopy.  I own over 50 cookbooks, cook/ bake EVERYTHING from scratch.  This is the only cookbook I have ever wanted to return and it is by far the worst cookbook I ever tried.  Thankfully the bookseller took the book
B001VEHZZ2|5.0|It is no surprise that Mohsin Hamid's second novel, \\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist,\\" became a New York Times Bestseller and the winner of multiple literary awards. It is a brilliant book that is a small gem that glistens softly and darkly - more of a star opal than a glittering diamond. Hamid using a unique approach - a sole narrator, the young Pakistani, Changez. The action - much of which is interior and psychological action -unfolds as Changez converses with an unnamed American stranger with whom he shares a table at a cafe in Lahore, Pakistan. The effect is like that of listening in on only one half of a phone conversation and having to fill in the missing pieces from the context of the answers given and questions posed by the narrator.<br /><br />With the exception of Changez, all of the other characters exist only as seen through his perception of them or as revealed through his description of them. It is akin to our not being able to see the wind, but to learn of its nature by the effect that it has upon the objects that move in response to its shifting currents and eddies.<br /><br />Hamid does a breath-taking job of subtly limning the ambiguities of interpersonal intercourse and international intrigue. One never knows - even at the end of the story - if we are dealing with two \\"normal\\" human beings interacting in space and time at an outdoor cafe in Lahore, or if one is an actual or potential terrorist and the other a potential assassin. The clues and muted red herrings are there for the reader to interpret based upon his world view, fears, prejudices and presuppositions. This is a post-9/11 tale of dark and muted rage and paranoia.<br /><br />The themes swirl around the twin towers of fear and ghosts. I dare not say more, lest I spoil what should be an intriguing and delicious read for most sentient readers.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Al

Tracks like \\"Mars vs. Venus\\" and \\"Guilty\\" prove that Usher hasn't lost his swagger like many though after he got married and fired his mother as his manager. Now that he's divorced and has hired his mother back, his career is getting back on track, Thank GOD!!!

When it comes to both audio & picture quality, this blu ray is simply one of the best in the market, in my opinion. Hope you enjoy it, too !!!
0143117157|5.0|As I grew up in Britain I well remember the anti-apartheid demonstrations which routinely disrupted games against the Springboks in the 1960s, and how the game of Rugby was made to suffer at the hands of politics. There is thus a perfect and beautiful irony in the fact that President Mandela used that same game to unite the nation of South Africa in the Rugby World Cup 1995. Rugby had the last laugh and triumphed over politics, you might say. Interestingly in May 2010 just before it begins people are again asking whether the soccer World Cup will be able to unite the same nation in much the same way.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a truly inspirational and of course true story told in a masterful way and in great detail of the power of sport (and one sport in particular) to bring people together and allow them to overcome their racial, religious, political and other differences. And all credit to Nelson Mandela for learning Afrikaans while in prison on Robben island and thus crossing the barrier between the races which lesser men could never have surmounted.<br /><br />Ian Ruxton, translator of 'ULTIMATE CRUSH: Waseda University Rugby, Leadership and Building the Strongest Winning Team in Japan'
B0030Y11XS|4.0|The picture Michael Moore paints with this movie will already be quite familiar to anyone who's really been paying attention to what's been happening in the US and looking at the evidence objectively.<br /><br />As Moore notes, our current US version of capitalism has become severely compromised because people in certain domains (finance, health care, defense, media, very large corporations, etc.) have been able to implement schemes which rob the public wealth, and they've used their resulting concentrated wealth to powerfully manipulate our government in ways that enable perputation or expansion of those schemes.<br /><br />If the public was able to regain control of the government, these schemes could be shut down and our society could become much more equitable and even prosperous, but the question is how to break the hegemony.  Moore urges rebellion by the masses, but I have to admit that I'm not too optimistic about the prospects for that happening or being effective, though I don't really have any better ideas to offer myself.<br /><br />Where Moore somewhat errs is that he oversimplifies things.  The problem isn't the broad and diverse category of socioeconomic systems called \\"capitalism\\" but rather the particular corrupted version of capitalism which we currently have.  And indeed, Adam Smith himself was well aware of the dangers of corruption and pointed them out clearly in his writings.<br /><br />A related problem is the format of the movie.  Moore does succeed in putting a human face on economic suffering, and thereby elicits emotions which can stir us to action.  But he also paints with a broad brush which leaves out important details and reveals bias.  As a result, while this movie can effectively preach to the choir, I'm not sure that it will be convincing to people who are new to Moore's viewpoint (or opposed to it), so that may ironically undermine Moore's aim of stirring action on a mass scale.<br /><br />But in the end, Moore is mostly correct in his assertions, this story needs to be told, and it's OK for the story to be told from different angles (such as this movie), so I recommend this movie to anyone who cares about the future of our country.  Just keep in mind that this movie is only an introductory expos&eacute; on the topic, so you'll need to delve deeper and more rigorously to really understand the nuts and bolts of what's going on.old, and it's OK for the story to be told from different angles (such as this movie), so I recommend this movie to anyone who cares about the future of our country.

Why are some individuals successful like Bill Gates for example and others are not? Gladwell writes that it's a mixture of timing, opportunity, education, and chance. These individuals were born at the right time and took advantage of the right opportunities. Does this mean one's future is pretty much determined at birth? No. One must acknowledge the culture and society one has come from in order to change.

B00005YU1O|5.0|I am an unabashed fan of director Richard Linklater, and this is one of his best films. With intriguing dialogue (as always), deep human insight, unique Rotoscope animation (since copied by others), and a deft directorial touch, Linklater has again succeeded in producing a dynamic, auteuristic film. He certainly has a style all his own, which is rare.    Admittedly, the film is somewhat slow at times, and in parts it kind of feels like a version of his indie classic, Slacker (which isn't a bad thing at all), but those who enjoy true filmmaking and don't have the attention span of a gnat should find much to like about Waking Life.
B001N26GFM|4.0|A friend of mine had rented this movie because her son had watched part of it and suggested she get it. I had never heard of it, and I got only a minimal synopsis of it before watching it, because my friend didn't really know what it was about either. I don't want to totally spoil the movie, so I will just say... I was NOT expecting the outcome of the movie. I remember thinking as I was watching it that this certain scenario would play out... I totally didn't. So, be warned.... This is a great movie. Totally moving. But, it's intense in the end.

B000F3UAFC|5.0|Scarlett Johansson And Helen Hunt are not only beautiful in this movie, but they also prove that they have some powerful acting chops!<br />But the best part of the movie is the writing! There are wonderful lines in that movie you will love to use in your everyday vocabulary.
1439190275|5.0|I have tinkered with low carb, and several other diets before, but never adopted any approach as a \\"lifestyle.\\" I wanted to lose some weight quickly and keep it off, so I started the Atkins Diet with New Atkins for a New You about two weeks ago. I am amazed at how easy the program is for me to follow. The Atkins lifestyle is flexible enough for me to eat the foods that I want, wherever I am. Granted, for these first weeks, I have had to avoid some things, but I have been able to enjoy chicken, my favorite veggies (avocados!), and even butter and cheese. To date (after 13 days) I have lost 10 pounds, and am getting ready to start the second phase of the diet.<br /><br />Now I know that the Atkins approach isn't for everyone, but it seems like some comments on here are from people with an axe to grind - even from people with their own books to promote and sell. One argument tries to invalidate the research that Atkins has done. But it's logical that different research might end up with different conclusions. And one set of research does not invalidate the other. Right? The studies I've read in this book are comprehensive. As a result, I feel confident I can live a healthy lifestyle on the Akins Diet.<br /><br />For me, Atkins has worked and I'm excited to see more and more pounds drop off. In fact, I am on Amazon today to send books off to some friends who have tried different diets in the past, and are looking for a long-term answer. I'm going to tell them what I have said here: \\"Atkins is healthy, easy, delicious, and it works.\\"
B000O179FE|5.0|This movie has a nice slow and even pace and is fun to watch.<br />But you can read film reviews elsewhere. In this review I want to tell you that if you're not seeing Lost In Translation in HD, then you are totally wasting your time!<br />This motion pciture is visually stunning! The movie starts with a wonderful shot the lovely Scarlett Johansson's 18 year old butt, and only gets better from there! The whole movie was shot in Japan and one gets a true feeling for the city of Tokyo in the visuals of this film!<br /><br />LOST IN TRANSLATION ON HD-DVD WILL REMIND YOU WHY YOU BOUGHT A HI DEF TELEVISION IN THE FIRST PLACE!
014241493X|4.0|This was a great read.  The theme of the novel is how we constantly judge others through our own filter and never truly understand people (hence the last name of the main character is \\"Spiegelman\\"; spiegel = mirror in German).  John Green practically beats the reader over the head with this theme it is so omnipresent, and it makes the ending a little predictable.  But, overall it is a very entertaining read.  If you're a passive reader, you will find the book funny and fast-paced (mostly).  If you are an active reader, there is plenty of symbolism and metaphor to find.  In the end, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Although not perfect, it is much better than 95% of books I have read in the last year.
B003DEMV1Q|3.0|So the physical album costs $9.99, yet the MP3 album costs $10.99?  I've been a fan of usher since his first album, but charging over $10 for ANY music album nowadays is senseless.  I'll pass until I see this in Daily Deals.  Based on the reviews I've read, it will be there sooner rather than later.
B000RK3JOC|3.0|This is a good, book, but not a great book.  I laughed out loud throughout.  Although it is definitely John Green's weakest work, it is still very entertaining.

B002ZG97RE|4.0|\\"Green Zone\\" is the latest film starring Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass, who worked together in \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum.\\"<br /><br />Damon plays US Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller, who leads a team of soldiers tasked with finding Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)s in Iraq in 2003. Every site that intelligence sends them to turns out to have no WMDs. Frustration growing, Miller discovers two unlikely allies, a CIA agent played by Brendan Gleason who disapproves of the US's approach in finding the WMDs, and a Wall Street Journal reporter, played by Amy Ryan, who alerts Miller that the intelligence his unit is using is being provided by a top-secret informant named Magellan. Miller soon figures out that a Pentagon official played by Greg Kinnear knows who Magellan is, but Kinnear's character thwarts Miller's effort to get to the truth at every turn. Jason Isaacs plays a Special Forces officer who does Kinner's bidding in concealing the truth.<br /><br />This is a tense, exhilirating and tough-as-nails thriller with great performances by the entire cast. This is a movie that will grow in appreciation the further we get away from the events in Iraq.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|From begining to end this is a great album from Alice in Chains. The song order is excellent in the way that it flows through the album. A lot reviews complain about meaningless details.   At the end of the day if this album came out in 1992, 2002,2020 it would still be great. if this was the first album from the band it would be getting even better reviews than it already is.   That being mentioned if you liked any of the bands earlier albums you wont be able to nit pick your way out of liking this one.
B00005QK5X|5.0|I have to admit, I'm not so hardcore that I like the rougher early albums best -- my favorite album, included here, is \\"Over the Edge\\"    ...but if you have any interest at all in the evolution of rock to punk to post-punk, you need these records.  I mean mandatory need.    And oh by the way it really is the greatest guitar sound you've ever heard.  And oh by the way, Greg plays with an agility that lets his energy and ideas through unrestricted.  And he sings with an emotion that Cobain (may the Lord rest his soul) never achieved.    Lots of fans of bad bands think that said bands were \\"too good to become famous\\".  You could almost say this about the Wipers, but Greg was anti-\\"success\\", and it worked.  Unfortunately.
B0000DZTIL|5.0|This flick is good fun and a fond eighties memory.  the effects were decent enough and the comedy was pretty good.  check the springsteen influence on the main character.  if you think you kinda remembered this one and think you kinda liked it, yuo'll still dig it.
0891419063|4.0|This book moved me.  Written by an undecorated Marine grunt 35 years after the two miserable WWII island campaigns he took part in--the little known, but fierce battle in Peleliu and the well known, and even fiercer battle in Okinawa.<br /><br />I am fascinated with what our ancestors endured for the sake of this country and our freedom.  And I mean the teenage common soldier and sailor in the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, WWI and here, the Pacific theatre of WWII.  This is among the best at bringing home the reality of war--the horrors, the drudgery, the camaraderie, the misery, the exhilaration, you name it.<br /><br />What stands out in this account is the author's vivid, detailed memories of numerous, often ghastly, sometimes humorous, incidents that occur on the front lines of every war.  And he tells the stories with such modesty, honesty and economy you can't help but be drawn in.  It's obvious why these experiences colored the rest of their lives.<br /><br />Thank you Sledgehammer for writing this invaluable first hand history.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|AN EDUCATION gleams as little film so polished in every aspect that it is quite memorable. Based on a memoir by Lynn Barber and adapted very smartly for the screen by the talented Nick Hornby, AN EDUCATION, like every aspect of the film, is an understated bit of life.  It is basically a 1960s London coming of age story of a 16 year old bright young student Jenny (Carey Mulligan, a true find) who life is focused on passing exams to gain entrance into Oxford to read English. Her father Jack (Alfred Molina in one of his very finest roles to date) is her demanding father who refuses to let Jenny stray form his dream of her achieving an Oxford education: Jenny's passive mother Marjorie (Cara Seymour) seems browbeaten into believing Jack's goals. But enter the handsome if enigmatic David (Peter Sarsgaard) who sweeps Jenny off her feet despite the age difference and Jenny's plans for Oxford seem to be changing to a life of music and art and travel and fun: David's accomplice friends (Danny - Dominic Cooper and Helen - Rosamund Pike) help seduce the bright Jenny away from academia - until Jenny learns of the methods in which David and Danny make their living as petty thieves.  Always in the background are Jenny's teachers Olivia Williams and Emma Thompson who prove to be better 'educated' than the rest of the crew!  The story may not be new or unique but the delivery by this enormously talented cast makes it a film not likely to be forgotten.  Grady Harp, April 10
031606792X|4.0|The only book in the series I did not 100% love.  It had its good moments but the whole middle of the book was simply awful.
0446579939|5.0|I bought this book as a Christmas gift and ended up borrowing it afterwards to read it. This book isnt your traditional Nicholas Sparks. Of course there is the love story but it takes a different route then normal. I honestly was getting tired of his books because they all started to seem the same to me. After I heard about this one though I had to read it and couldnt put it down. It was a nice and refreshing book!

B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Probably my favorite season of this show.  The extras are great especially the commentaries by the actors.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A movie that's pretty rare, as it is a deeply touching movie that comes by it's emotions honestly, with not a false note. The tone of the movie is understated, not the typical Hollywood gloss, which makes it all the more effective. While I admit to being more of an action/horror/thriller fan, I do enjoy a movie with true emotions, and this one blew me away. Is it weepy?  Yes - me, I cried at three separate moments, not because I was being manipulated by the story, but, I was touched by it. Hachi's devotion is truly beautiful, his love for his master heart rending, and this movie is not to be missed. This will be one of my all time favorites and it's got the highest recommendation I can give. WHY this movie was abandoned by the studio is stunning - this movie has more heart than TEN \\"Marley And Me\\" movies.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This review is completely on the movie, not the packaging as some other reviewers are whining about.    The color is magnificent, story is well written.  You may be in tears during the first 15 minutes of the movie.  My wife still cries every time she watches it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is written in a simple format that leads to an easy, yet enjoyable read.
0393072231|5.0|Wish the author spent more time focusing on the changes in Wall Street culture that allowed the banks to take too much risk (the last chapter tries to do it).  The book shows that in the end no one really knew anything.  In the end even many of the people who made money off the crash were more lucky than smart. The book does make for fantastic reading - another lewis classic!
B00000736W|5.0|Okay-forget the the 6 CD set of the 1976 German tour all consisting of the same set 2-3days apart(unless you are bored and or rich) why? Simply because before the marketing Con of releasing those 3 double CD\\"s Richy Blackmore Himself picked the best performances of the German tour on this CD. Quite simply rainbow played the same set each night. So here is the best of those songs spread across four German citys. Clonge,Dusseldorf,Munich and yet to be released in a full Concert format Mannheim. \\"man on the silver mountain\\" is taken from there show at this city. I have read many reviews of frustrated buyers of the three city CD sets only to complain that they have the same set and could almost be the same show??? so save your pennys and buy this release after all it came out in 1990, and as I said before was hand picked by Richie as the best of the best songs on the 1976 German tour!
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|Not really what i thought the movie would be when i bought it.  It was good, and the last 15 or mins was really really jacked up for me.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|I bought this turntable like many others did to finally be able to listen to my old LPs on my iPod. I did have a 25 yr old turntable that I had been using, but it finally bit the dust, and I never got around to getting the wires to hook it up to the computer.     As a turntable this is clearly a very basic model. There is no adjustment for needle pressure or anti-skid like I was used to, there is no fine strobe adjustment for speed, and there is no setting to play 78s. That said, the basic functions that it does have seem to work fine. The start and stop buttons move the needle onto the record smoothly and the cuing function seems to work fine. The sound quality is very good when played through my stereo speakers. I don't have high end speakers for my computer, but it sound OK through them anyway.    The software that comes with it works alright, but does take some effort to get configured. Some have said that they can't listen while it is recording, but I found that it wasn't hard to configure my sound setting to be able to hear as it is recording. I found that as long as I change the audio preferences to use the \\"Windows Classic Wave Driver\\" instead of the \\"Microsoft Sound Mapper\\" it works fine. I do have a few minor complaints. I found that I have to turn down the recording level to less than 10/100, and for some albums as low as 5, to avoid clipping and distortion. I am looking at settings to see if this is an issue with something I have set up or just the nature of the turntable. I don't know if it is because of the low levels, but I have found that for some albums it does not do a very good job at separating tracks. Unfortunately if you use the wizard mode to make a recording there is no way to change the regions that it assigns before it saves the file. What I have been doing in this case is to let the wizard finish and then manually setting regions to represent each song and then saving. It is a little more work, but the resulting files sound good and I haveno problem loading them into iTunes. I do find that when doing this it is important to use the zoom function to be able to make a fine distinction between tracks, otherwise it's hard to get the track separations in exactly the right place.    I am not an audio engineer, but with a little effort was able to get the software and hardware to work together to get a good result. Overall I think it was a good investment.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Great movie. Very suspensful! Had one complaint about delivery, but was handled very well by seller.
B0036EBARO|4.0|Anyone who is a fan of Goldfrapp knows that each and every one of their albums is completely different and stand-alone in their own right.    That's why when anyone asks me what my favorite Goldfrapp album is, my response is often:  \\"It depends on what my mood is.\\"    For this album, my mood had better be carefree and driving around in bright, warm sunshine.  Goldfrapp takes on an 80s vibe and while this has spelled P-O-I-S-O-N for bands like Keane who tried a similar approach in the first half of their Perfect Symmetry album, Goldfrapp nails it in a way that isn't kitschy and twists the sound into a way that makes it their own.    Goldfrapp has made me remember that there exists a brighter side to everything even in these dark times and that musical euphoria can be the best medicine.  Allison's vocals are, of course, brilliant and beautifully scintillating throughout.  Her partner in crime, Gregory, has managed to catch everything that made the 80s sound with its catchy electronic rhythms, keyboards, and sounds ranging from New Wave to occasionally borrowing something that is borderline Pet Shop Boys.    The result is quite pleasant to listen to and it grows on me more and more with each listen.  Favorite tracks include \\"Rocket\\", \\"Alive\\", and \\"Dreaming.\\"  \\"Head First\\" features keyboards that are vaguely reminiscent of something that might have come from Abba, the latter years.    However - 2 complaints which dock it a star:  1) \\"Voicething\\" as a musical, vocal track is completely out of place here and might have been better off as a \\"B-side\\" single and 2) the album just clocks at just over 38 minutes; even for an album that may have been released from an artist in the 80s, this is woefully short.  I would have happily waited another 6-9 months if it meant we could have had a 50 minute album without \\"Voicething\\" included.    Apart from those 2 complaints, the album is great and shows off how Goldfrapp remains eclectic and refuses to be pigeonholed.
B0026NWBY2|2.0|I agree with the last reviewer that many songs are missing.<br />the most notable is dark horse , not for you , bangla desh,<br />gone troppo , the list can go on.they should have omitted the beatles songs.
B000004166|5.0|This is a superb set.  Grumiaux is not exactly a household name in America, but in Europe the great Belgian violinist (who was made a baron late in his life) was a superb artist.  Philips' recording is outstanding for its time, and Grumiaux is flawless in his technique and his musicality.  This is certainly one of the great Mozart sets, worth many hearings.  Highly recommended.
B000067CPX|3.0|It takes seven songs in to \\"By The Way\\" before the familiar popping base of Flea and the rapping howl of Anthony Kiedis. The first six tracks? Gently melodic songs that play out as cool, focused. I guess we should have seen this coming from the muted blue colors in the soft art cover; this is the Peppers cooling off after the fiery \\"Californication.\\"<br /><br />There's plenty of decent songs on \\"By The Way,\\" problem is, there's nothing excellent. The songs come off as self-search, introspective and slow. The title song and the \\"Warm Tape\\" are the best of the ballads here. But the band's always worked best under the operative \\"Red Hot\\" part of their name. This is like asking for the espresso burrito and finding out they put cool ranch on your meal.
0802130208|3.0|A book about nothing, a few weeks in the life of Ignatius Reilly, an unforgettable \\"hero\\" (but does someone who has so many defaults wrapped around a core of goodwill - or was it the opposite - deserve that name ?) revolted about pretty much anything that surrounds him : contemporary pop culture, fashion, work and work organization, and so on, nothing pleases him in out outside world, and he joyfully excels at making himself useless in it. Following Ignatius' \\"adventures\\" (once again a strange word since, due to his lifestyle, going to the supermarket is in itself an odyssey) is like following a 200kgs genius child of Hunter S. Thompson (a soft core version though) in an adult's body leaving behind him a mixed trail of comedy and drama. The book is famous for being one of the best novels about the New Orleans language and culture (or at least what it was back in the 60s-70s) and the influence the French/Meditteranean lifestyle had on that part of the USA, something which might be obvious and add to the book's exotism but didn't strike me, maybe because I'm so close to the french culture it was hard to find it \\"out of the ordinary\\"...<br />(feedback/analysis on that point are more than welcome)<br />A weird hero for our weird world.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|SHERLOCK HOLMES    I wanted to see this movie so bad because I have always been a fan of Holmes and of course of Robert Downey Jr. So I was a bit disappointed when I missed it in the theaters and had to wait for the DVD/Blu Ray release and all that. So as I waited some things went down but eventually it was released. So naturally I went out and had to own this even without seeing it. Still that didn't matter we all wanted to see it so off we went to view the new Holmes movie. So was it worth a purchase or did I waste my money, we will see I guess.    Of course you know the story follows Holmes [Downey] and his partner in crime {fighting} Watson [Jude Law] and their adventures. This time around Watson is on his way out since he is getting married, Holmes is none to happy about that. So with their biggest case in the books when they catch Lord Blackwood [Mark Strong] it becomes their last together. That is of course until Blackwood seems to return from the grave and black magic seems to fill the streets. Holmes of course is to intrigued to not investigate and Watson seems to not be able to let it go either. So off they go on what once again is their biggest case and potentially their last together.    There is a lot to like about this movie and for starters it stars Downey who is always excellent and Jude Law. Downey makes for the perfect Sherlock Holmes with his witty yet off style of detection. You could tell this was just a fun role for him and the same can be said about Law. I thought he did an excellent job on this film matching Downey and was really funny. Mark Strong was great as the lead villain in this film and played it perfectly and Rachel McAdams was great as well [and looking really good]. All in all I would say that the performances were all very fun and all did a good job.    Also I have always loved the time period this was set in and the look and feel of it. The filmmakers did a great job in that department as well. Director Guy Ritchie I am sure wentinto this trying to make an intriguing and entertaining film. He did do that for the most part but the movie failures are covered at least in my opinion by how fun it was. Written by four different writers I would say the script is probably were the trouble laid. All had different ideas I am sure and therefore made the film feel overloaded at times, and not fully explored at others. Still it is an entertaining film that I found funny.    Was this a perfect movie, no, but like I said it was still a very fun one that I am sure will produce a sequel. Hopefully the next one will be just as entertaining and fun but with a little added substance. I say buy it if you into these kinda films because I am glad I got it. Some people this may be just a rental but I think you will like it. I do recommend this film but go in just wanting to be entertained, just have fun with it.

B002RD4UZ4|5.0|When I heard two or three cuts from My One and Only Thrill on Public Radio, I literally stopped what I was doing to take down her name so I could research her and her work. I ordered this and an earlier CD of hers that day. I'm so glad I did, as is my husband. Every track is spot-on.  Melody has an excellent voice, and she knows how to use it! Her musicians are the best and give a peak performance. Delivering her original lyrics and music her unique vocal style, she paints emotional landscapes that ring true and close to the heart.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Indeed he got his wish, though technically he was ALREADY a legend once this double cd opus hit store shelves. Rap would never be the same again after Pac shook the world with this classic double cd.<br /><br />This is one of those groundbreaking albums that really changed the game up. Pac had released the classic and critically acclaimed \\"Me Against the World\\" the previous year, but it was this album which truly turned him into a hip hop icon. Almost every mainstream rapper today uses this as a blueprint to make their own records, but none have been able to match it yet. Pac covered essentially all angles here: Hardcore street songs, club anthems, classic posse cuts/duets, introspective songs, sad songs and socially charged/political songs. Although I dont consider it his BEST album (that title goes to Me Against the World), it is his most influential and certainly his most well known.<br /><br />The first disc starts off with the very dark and brazen \\"Ambitionz Az a Ridah\\", which has to feature one of the sickest beats ever laid to wax. Its easy to tell from the get go that this was almost a completely different man then the one who did Me Against the World. Hes out of jail now and hes back with a vengeance. But after that first song, it goes to another important theme on the album with All About U, a song about groupies which features a beat totally made for the clubs. Also featured on the first disc is the classic track with Snoop, \\"2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted\\", the club anthem How Do U Want It, and of course CA's anthem, the infamous California Love with Dr. Dre. However these hits just scratch the surface of why this album is so great. You also get the extremely reflective and knowledge of self \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\", as well \\"Life Goes On\\" which is a beautiful and very sad ballad, probably one of the saddest songs you will ever hear and one of Pac's greatest tracks overall. The second disc isnt quite as strong as the first but it still holds its own...you havethe Dr. Dre produced \\"Cant C Me\\", the cautionary \\"Shorty's Gonna Be a Thug\\", and my personal favorite on the second disc, \\"Holla At Me\\". This beat is just bonkers and Pac tears the song up with a relentless fury. The self titled song, Thug Passion, Picture me Rollin, and Aint Hard 2 Find are all dope too. There a few filler cuts as is the case on all double albums, but minus maybe 3-4 songs this is heat all the way through.<br /><br />Like most of Pac's albums, this album is a classic and timeless. Along with Me Against the World and Makaveli the 7 Day Theory, this ranks as one of his best. Still sounds as fresh now as it did in '96. What made this album so great, besides its versatility was that it really showed Pac was continuing to grow as an artist. Its an album so opposite of what Me Against the World was, but thats probably why both albums are still so loved to this day, cause they are stark contrasts of one another but both are outstanding for different reasons. Me Against the World was pretty much his autobiography, All Eyez on Me was his celebration of life in the fast lane as a mega star. So many rappers (DMX, 50, Eminem, etc) tried to use the formula that Pac perfected with this album, but no one has come close. A hip hop classic that needs to be in every rap fans collection. If you dont own it, you're buggin.

B002T9H2LA|1.0|I have to say this movie was very disappointing. The film is essentially about nothing at all, other than a group of people trying to stop the Nazi takeover of Europe during WWII. Brad Pitt has a starring role as the goofy redneck Lt. Aldo Raine, who is leading a small platoon of Jewish-American soldiers whose mission is to kill as many Nazis as possible. They are ruthless and become something of legend amongst the Nazis, thus catching the attention of  \\"Jew Hunter\\" Col. Landa. The Basterds eventually intersect with some crazy revenge plot created by a Jewish cinema owner, who intends to burn the cinema to the ground with all the elite Nazi leaders inside including the big man himself Adolf Hitler (ummm, yeah... right).<br /><br />Much like Kill Bill 1 & 2, Inglourious Basterds is a total detachment from reality and is very \\"comic book like\\" in nature. Tarantino rewrites history with this film, but I must ask what is the point exactly???<br /><br />The performances by most of the leading actors are simply over the top when it comes to Hollywood refuse. Pitt's chracter, Lt. Raines, seems to come off as a macho dumbass redneck that is more concerned about killing, baseball batting, and \\"branding\\" Nazis than actually winning this so-called pesky war this story takes place in. It is almost like Brad Pitt was just plugged into this film and was asked to simply give a horrible performance--such as with his effort to make sure the audience knows (over and over again) Lt. Raines is from the south. Pitt's effort to pull off a southern accent is simply horrible and at times quite laughable which makes this otherwise good actor look like a total buffoon.<br /><br />The cameo of Mike Myers as a British officer, really was a waste for this great comic actor.  As Austin Powers would say \\"It's not my bag baby!\\"<br /><br />However, I found Christoph Waltz, who plays Col. Landa, to be quite remarkable--Waltz is the epitome of a movie \\"bad guy.\\" During the film you can't help but think: \\"There is no way this guy ever had a mother!\\"<br /><br />Tarantino attempted a few incredible moments within this film. One such moment is in the conclusion, when Shoshanna's (the cinema owner) face is projected on the billows of smoke from the burning theater... kudos. Unfortunately, it is part of this horrible film that is full of too much dialogue, subtitles, and meaningless long scenes.<br /><br />A lot of Tarantino films are just a bunch of Hollywood film art that is simply about, well... nothing (reminds me of a Seinfeld episode) and Inglourious Basterds follows the same old Tarantino mold of tons of unnecessary dialogue, over the top violence, stupid characters, and a go nowhere storyline (not that one ever really exists).ever had a mother!\\"     Tarantino attempted a few incredible moments within this film.

B002QQ8HAG|2.0|I thought the film \\"Valentino\\" was both exciting as well as interesting, and in the end, the film gave a real glimpse of Valentino, both as a person and a designer.  The visuals were wonderful and led you into the real world of fashion, and the closing music, Puccini's \\"O mia babbino caro\\", lifted the spirit and carried the viewer away.  It was downright enjoyable.    \\"The September Issue\\" on the other hand, was a major disappointment.  There's no denying Anna Wintour, as chief editor of Vogue, is a legend in her own right, and the most powerful and influential person in the fashion industry today, both here and abroad.  Anna Wintour, however, is an introvert by nature and seriously committed to her work.  Although there were moments when you could sense the person behind the work ethic, in general, she is not the type of person who animates much, and therefore doesn't make for an interesting subject, despite her credentials.  Her daughter was enjoyable and added a freshness to the film that was overall pretty dull.  That being said, Grace Coddington was a mystery. Talented and nice, she may be, and not to be unkind, but how could anyone high in the fashion world allow herself to look so unattractive? She must be in her 60's, with long red, frizzy, dry hair, no make-up, and clothes and shoes that looked like they came from WalMarts. It is rather mind boggling to consider when she is surrounded by talented hair dressers, make-up artists, and lovely clothes.  Not that she needs to dress herself up like a model, she's been there and done that in her early years, but at least have some self respect and dress accordingly, rather than looking like someone who works at a bowling alley.  I think the most interesting person may have been the large black man (name unknown) but sadly for the viewer the film director didn't give him any real exposure.
B00319ECHE|4.0|This is a great album and it almost compares to the brilliance of the albums released by the original Fear Factory lineup.  It's not quite on the level of Demanufacture or Obsolete.  Those albums are difficult to top and fused perfectly the mechanical aggression with the emotion brought forth by Burton's brilliant melodies.  If I had a complaint, it would be that there is too much of the aggression and not enough of the melody on this album.  But the fusion of the two is definitely more prevalent on this album than on the last two.  Rhys Fulber's production is brilliant of course.  He always does a great job with Fear Factory and it's a big reason why this album is so good.  All in all, it's a great album.  And I can't pretend it's not because Dino is back.  In my opinion, the brilliance of Fear Factory has always been the pairing of Burton and Dino.  It's great to see the album's theme fit into the Fear Factory story a bit more than Archetype and Transgression did.  Both conceptually and musically, I would consider those albums \\"non-canon.\\"  Mechanize is definitely a \\"canon\\" Fear Factory album.

B000005RS0|5.0|There are records and then there is \\"Private Dancer\\", Tina Turner's remarkable comeback album that was originally released in 1984 and catapulted her into superstardom. Critics fell over themselves praising \\"Private Dancer\\" upon its release. The album's sound is very much 1980's, but the songs have never become outdated. This collection belongs in everyone's CD collection. The album went 5X platinum in the United States alone, and has sold over 20,000,000 copies worldwide. Seven tracks were released as singles including \\"Better Be good To Me\\", \\"Let's Stay Together (the album's first single), \\"I Might Have Been Queen\\", \\"the title cut, and the blockbuster \\"What's Love Got To Do With It?\\", Tina's only #1 song in America, staying at the top for three straight weeks, and becoming the title to the movie about her life. Tina received four Grammys, including Best Female Vocal Performance(Pop) for \\"What's Love...\\", Best Rock Female Performance for \\"Better Be Good To Me\\", and \\"What's Love...\\" received both the Record and Song of the Year Grammys. This collection features all tracks digitally restored and enhanced and comes with bonus tracks including rare songs only released as B-Sides to singles from the \\"Private Dancer\\" recording sessions including \\"I Wrote A Letter\\", \\"Rock and Roll Window\\", and \\"Don't Rush The Good Things\\". There are also extended versions of \\"What's Love Got To Do With It\\", \\"Better Be Good To Me\\", and \\"I Can't Stand The Rain\\". \\"Private Dancer\\" is Tina's fourth studio album after \\"Tina Turns The Country On\\" (1974), \\"Acid Queen\\" (1975), \\"Rough\\" (1978), and \\"Love Explosion\\" (1979), all of which were poor sellers and didn't chart.

044656740X|2.0|I do not recommend this book at all.  Most of the glowing reviews are written by people who you can tell are not very informed about investing or finance.  Kiyosaki is something close to a con artist in my opinion.      I found this book to be annoyingly repetitive and filled with catchphrases.  It was practically like reading a political speech.  Kiyosaki has a lot of fun little turns of phrase like \\"Don't work for money, make money work for you!\\"  Of course that is why we're reading this book, to find out how to make money work for us.  What you will find instead is a droning rambling account of numerous anecdotes and, at the risk of being repetitive myself, catchphrases.      In a nutshell, my main complaint about this book was that at the end I felt that I hadn't learned anything.  There is not a single number in the entire book.  There are no techniques for determining how to invest your money.  He mentions real estate a few times, and that's apparently how he got his fortune, along with selling his series of books, coaching, board games, and speaking at seminars.  But if you are looking for information about how to invest your money effectively, you will not find it here.     I would recommend several other books for that kind of knowledge.  The Intelligent Investor is a classic.  If you have the stomach for it, Security Analysis (by the same author).  This is a textbook for finance and investing classes.  There are many books about Warren Buffet's style of investing of varying quality.  You can get all of the annual letters to the Berkshire Hathaway stockholders online for free at the website, so don't buy any compilations of those.      In closing, it is not easy to make money investing.  Investing is not flashy and fun, it is a lot of work and is probably too dull for most people.  You need a lot of patience and a willingness to work with numbers and read financial statements, etc.  If you want to be a serious investor, you need tools and methods, not emptycatchphrases that Kiyosaki offers.  If you don't have the time or energy to put forth the sufficient effort, then simply dollar-cost average into index funds or mutual funds, because you probably won't do any better yourself.  On the other hand, I'm trying it myself, though I try to remain realistic about my performance.  In any case, this book is a waste of money.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|This movie is one big CGI 3D 450 mln promo for the studio.    A C- story line which would be ok for an early low budget sci 80s movie, no one would remember 6 month later. The intelligence of a plot is on the level of 8-14 old kids who appreciate the graphics. The whole thing feels like a Old movies about Indians and World of WarCraft combined into one (the whole planet and the aliens just SCREAMS \\"Night Elves\\"). 5 years from now there is going to be 10 more full 3D movies build on this technology which will have 10 times as good story line.     This one - is nothing but all hype and no content, and a cash grinding machine for Cameron. What else did you expect from a man who made a crap like Titanic?  His days of legends like Terminator and Aliens are long gone. He is just an old man who at the end of his path switched from making good moves, to making good for himself.
0307454541|4.0|I usually don't read mystery novels.  I'm more of a chick lit or plain old non-fiction.  This book was suggested by a friend of mine so I thought inbetween all the real world stuff I would read a mystery.  Wow! I was shocked at how much I loved it.  It was slightly hard for me to get into in the begining (so don't give up on it) but once I got the main characters down I couldn't stop.  I had to order the second novel in the series \\"The girl who played with fire\\" before I was done so I didn't have down time in between.

This second book from Stieg Larsson takes you deeper into Lisabeth Salander's world.  You began to feel for her and almost support any wrong doing she may have done.  At about a quarter into the book the mystery presents itself and I couldn't put it down, up until the end it kept me guessing.  You don't have to like mystery novels to be a fan of this one.
B000X9ZERW|3.0|All the criticisms made by the 'kid's review' dude are valid. Using the 'plausible deniability' of a so-called 'work of art,' these guys confess to murders on these raps, and not only that, they brag about it. They also express a willingness to force themselves on women (and men, they call them the punk mfs in prison lingo), steal the property of and shoot and kill anyone they want with very little justification (they do play the race card often but they certainly do not consider themselves 'victims' in any way, except to a certain extent, former victims to police brutality who are victims no more), especially Police.<br /><br />I can't imagine how many middle-class folks of all colors in the suburbs dumped in their pants and bought extra guns and ammo when they first heard this. I'm one of those guys. Here was the ultimate blaxploitation in its rawest form. But this wasn't a joke and these guys weren't Shaft or Superfly. These aren't actors here acting a part in \\"Goodfellas from the Ghetto,\\" based on real events, these are the actual gangsters themselves (well, at least 2 or 3 of them for sure), glorifying violence, bragging about being completely ruthless, Ill-tempered, backstabbing, merciless jerks with no honor whatsoever. This album and hundreds of gangsta rap albums after it, cannot be morally justified in their lyrical content. Even Chris Rock admitted this. They certainly do more harm than good in society at large, in the short and long term, when art that imitated life is imitated in turn by life again and so on and son, the cycle continues.<br /><br />More people got murdered in the inner-cities pursuing the ruthless, macho ideal glorified on this record and its legion of imitators, more blacks than ever ended-up in the prison system and more middle-class whites lost their manners and minds and got in trouble also, went to prison and experienced rectal discomfort. And yet, despite all this, despite being an immoral work, glorifying a harmul and degenerate attitude no decent or respectable person would or should imitate, it remains a work of art, a very powerful and skillfully constructed and performed, raw work of explosive and poisonous-as-an overdose-of-China-white-Heroin-if mishandled poetry , and hence, its undeniable power to influence. This is the glaring paradox which is the fascination of all 'gangsta rap,' the reason why this genre of rap remained popular while the others faded away. Most people will not analyze it but nevertheless sense this. How can elements that are harmful create a thing of ferocious and ruthless beauty? How did the synthesis occur?<br /><br />Should S.O.O.Compton be officially censored because it does more harm than good when many so-called adults subconsciously take in its message and act on it to alter their behavior for the worse, like children would? Absolutely not. All works of art are pieces of a vast puzzle that illuminate different aspects of the human condition and this is just one piece. Those who see the one piece as the whole puzzle are the problem. What is needed are intelligent consumers who can understand, criticize and discern the many elements presented by a complex work and put it into context, rather than just accepting it wholesale as 'good' on a gut level. Works of art made by mass-murderers (Churchill), killers (Phil Spector), prostitutes (Judee Sill, Xaviera Hollander, Janis Joplin, Madonna, Billie Holiday), Thieves (Jean Genet) rapists (Polanski), pederasts (Proust, William Burroughs, Andre Gide, Allen Ginsberg), pimps (Iceberg Slim, Miles Davis), thieves/drug addicts (Chet Baker, Art Pepper and hundreds of others) and charlatans (that idiot on Oprah, Carlos Castaneda) all remain valid if they satisfy the main criterion of art which is an ability to communicate something new and fascinating about the human condition on a transcendent level, however wretched and low-life that condition.<br /><br />The ruthless feelings of Ice Cube expressed in the lyrics of NWA are present in much less extreme form in most human beings or else how would they recognize it? No matter how much of a low-life Ice Cube is, he did what few people will ever accomplish in their lives, he created a genuine if dangerous work of art. Machiavelli expresses some of the same feelings and strategies in a much more refined but not necessarily more communicative way. Machiavelli in the wrong hands is also very dangerous. Pascal has a saying \\"Man's greatness is so obvious, it can be proven even by his wretchedness.\\" If \\"Straight Out of Compton\\" had no artistic merit then it would not be dangerous and no one would worry about it or be interested in it for very long. It would not spawn hundreds of imitators which the social engineers puppeteering behind the scenes, working for the five giant companies that own all media, very cynically and deliberately used, along with desensitizing violent video games and movies to condition the already systematically dumbed-down masses, both black and white, inner city and suburbs, for the worse.<br /><br />The social engineers realized that albums like \\"Straight Out of Compton\\" cause 'moral confusion' among people who are exposed to it for an extended period of time and then due to a lack of discernment and stupidity, they experience 'cognitive dissonance\\" and a resulting subconscious equating of 'good art' with 'good morals,' (even if consciously they realize, hey, what these guys are advocating is pretty obscene and wrong even under the extreme circumstances of war and ghetto life gangland warfare). Loosening of morals, and freedom from morals is then sensed as an opportunity for a lazier, 'better' way of existing. In other words, if the art is good and true and has ferocious beauty and strength, then the morals that go with it must be pretty valid too or beneficial to adopt or else how did these morals, however twisted and ruthless, manage to create the true art when other methods by Nickelback and L.L. Cool J failed? This subconscious equating of the artistic with the moral is gradually exploited to the point where like Pavlov's dog, the mouths of the masses start to water with the potential meat of \\"loosening of morals' at every ringing of the bell of anything 'gangsta rap' while the art (meat) has long been replaced with nothing, or mountains of completely or mostly harmful product with no redeeming value.<br /><br />Nabokov said that creating a work of art is like composing riddles with elegant solutions. Once the elegant solution is found, the work transcends and remains valid and strong despite any other potentially harmful aspects such as unsympathetic, perverted characters. Well, that's what NWA did on this album, they somehow found a most vulgarly elegant and most direct solution to the riddle of how to express \\"the strength of street knowledge.\\" They were not the first to do so, Iceberg Slim, Jim Carroll, Jean Genet, Edward Bunker and many others came before them.

0061537969|5.0|Great book on what goes on inside the mind of a dog. It grabs you by putting you in the dogs head of what he sees his humans around him doing. A good read for people who love to drive fast and love dogs. Your adrenalin is running but around the next page your crying.

B001OQCV6A|3.0|I think the initial reaction to the casting of Robert Downey Jr. for SH must have been like the announcement that Michael Keaton would play Batman back in the 1980s. But then again, Robert Downey Jr. used 'Ironman' to transform himself from quirky troubled actor to mainstream leading man star. So perhaps most were not so surprised.     First, the good things about this film: (1) Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law make a great comic team, and much of their interaction is very funny. (2) Lots of elaborate sets, soiled costumes and CGI to give us 'gritty detail' of what London might have been like for both the very rich and the far more numerous poor. (3) A story that seems to say, what IF, SH and Dr. W. were REAL people (at least in the imaginary universe of this film) and were somewhat different than the literary portrayal Watson gives in the universe of the stories (afterall, SH often complained about Watson's write-ups).    Next the bad things about this film: (1) Robert Downey Jr. turns this into a star vehicle, and Jude Law holds his own as the other half of the partnership, but the depictions are simply too far from the literary sources and too close in time to the recent memory of Jeremy Brett's dominating, absoulutely brilliant and extensive portrayal of SH. (2) What is the point of such QUASI-authentic detail if the film itself is stuck with such a wild fantasy and ludicrous plot? (It is true that Conan Doyle brought elements of gothic, macabre and the supernatural into the stories, but this film is more Wild, Wild West than Conan Doyle). (3) In attempting to re-do SH and Dr. W., the makers of this film admirably revive some little-known or nearly-forgotten aspects of the characters and stories, but they then squeeze far too many such aspects into far too little time (it might work in a revisionist mini-series, but haven't we already had these, at least in a way, such as a mini-series about Arthur Conan Doyle's younger days). (4) This is very much a Guy Ritchie film where he drags out a lot of his usual moves and camera techniques--if you love that, fine, but if you are here for a new version of SH, it often proves distracting, repetitious and silly.     The SH stories themselves alternated between urban and rural settings (the 'manor' mysteries). And perhaps the greatest SH story is actually one of the greatest full-length detective novels of all time, The Hound of the Baskervilles. It is a manor mystery, not a London story.     Ultimately, what holds back this Ritchie project from greatness is what dooms film versions of our favorite comic action heroes. Their ongoing serial nature. These heroes and their stories might be better told in a series with many episodes, but outside of animation, the economics of film-making and TV programming do not support the genre very well (with a few exceptions, such as 'The Flash' and 'Smallville'). They do not make great complete-in-themselves 2-hour films. Raimi tried with Spiderman with mixed results by the third installment. This SH series will come undone when Robert Downey Jr. or Jude Law get tired with the roles.
055357342X|5.0|This is the third book in George RR Martin's epic series, and by all means, this is an epic.  The book is massive both in scale and length, continuing the mutiiple story lines from the prior books, with each chapter focused on a particular character. As mentioned before, the author has no qualms about killing, maiming or drastically changing characters, including ones considered to be major players. I was shocked by some of the events in this volume and kept having to stop myself from going ahead to find the next chapter for a particular character to find out what had happened. Without giving anything away, this book focuses more on Jon Snow, Tyrion, Arya and Sansa, with the other major characters having less presence. I have no idea where things will end up in the next volume, although  I am tempted to wait to read it until the next, long promised volume is published.
B002VECMAE|3.0|... is the claim of the opening of the film.<br />This film should work. You have a weird screwball story with splendid actors (Bridges, Clooney, Spacey). It links hippy times with the Iraq war.<br />A failing reporter (played by an oddly unnerving E. McGregor) tries to find a scoop in Iraq. He finds a crazy guy played by a splendid Clooney, a man who has been a psychic spy in the New Earth Army, run by Bill Jango (i.e. J.Bridges). That was an army outfit in the 80s, trying to develop paranormal war fare (not that anybody believed in it, but the Soviets were working at it, so 'we' had to do the same... That was your cold war, each superpower wanted to be the first with super powers! After all the effort, Clooney managed to stare a goat into a heart attack, as the crowning achievement.)<br />Clooney's character Lyn was the star of the outfit, but he has lost it. Spacey's character was the bad guy in the outfit, but he is the boss now. Bridges was the pioneer, but he is a lost soul now.<br />See, you get my drift. Nice original idea, but oh so unfunny!
B000WS4OZM|5.0|I have always loved folk, old style country and the darker, more acoustic broody side of rock. My husband is a dyed in the wool lover of classic old time Country music and bluegrass, but most of all, he loves pretty much anything Johnny Cash sings. This album is the perfect marriage of our tastes, only Johnny Cash could take songs from such disparate genres and make each and every one of them his own, to the extent that you cannot even recall them belonging to another artist. The spare arrangements work perfectly with his unique voice and the guitar work is a thing of simple beauty. More than anything though, I love the way his gravelly voice forces you to listen to each every word, however painful, however (darkly) humorous.     Anyone with a younger, sweeter voice might have made a song like I Wont Back Down sound like pap teenage rebellion, Cash turns it into a mature declaration of how to sincerely live. The same is true with any number of songs which could be rendered trite or overly sentimental or melodramatic, but which become moving, sometimes disturbing, but always thought provoking thanks to the straightforward delivery of Johnny Cash and the stark, haunting arrangements.    Standouts include I Wont Back Down, Solitary Man, Mercy Seat and Darkness, but all the tracks are well done, an album my husband and I listen to over and over and over.
B0018AK9RK|5.0|A very bold, imaginative, sweeping epic, the most artistic thing the Metal Gods have ever done, yet brutal at times.  Still on the cutting edge in their 4th decade.  Seriously, it's hard to believe most of these guys are pushing SIXTY and are still in stunning form!  More importantly, they're still creating relevant new music and not bowing to trends or rehashing the past. Relative youngsters like Metallica for example have been wheezing like tired dogs for well over a decade, but The Priest still sounds as vital as ever and in my book this shares the mantle of Masterpiece along with Painkiller and British Steel.<br /><br />Overall, the production is excellent, although the drums are a bit distant and lack the attack of Painkiller or Angel of Retribution.  The performances by the band members are stunning.  Sometimes I think how great it would have been to have had the Painkiller era Halford on vocals for more high register screams, but I love it the way it is.  The maturity in Halford's voice probably suits the sometimes world-weary material better than the demon screams of Painkiller anyway. The twin guitar attack team of Glen Tipton and K.K. Downing certainly haven't mellowed with age; if anything, they've upped their game yet again. Lush keys provide a nice backdrop for key passages of the album and sound totally at home.<br /><br />The atmosphere of the two-album set runs the gamut from determination to anger to sadness to regret to acceptance and is quite a bit to digest. I recommend you set aside some time to either read a book or lie on a couch or do something while the albums play in the background the first time, or take them on a long road trip, makes it easier to absorb them.  I listened to Album 1 three times before I heard Album 2, which worked for me, because by then I was already thoroughly familiar with the setup of the story. Oh and please, an epic album like this deserves the best sound system you have----CRANKED----for proper impact!!  This story is too big for a clock radio....ig for a clock radio....
0307463745|1.0|I bought this book reading good reviews, and trusting the past work of David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH), and by ignoring the reveiwers who have given this book one or two stars, only to get hugely disappointed in the book.  The book has catchy titles for so-called \\"essays\\" which are hardly 150 to 200 words long and have no real content. The essays also seem to be directed at different audiences and there is no continuity, for example, some essays seems to be talking to new enterpreneurs and some essays seem to be talking to software programmers. If you have heard DHH speak or read the 37signals' first book \\"Getting real\\", then, you will find this book completely worthless.  I returned my book even though it meant I lost more than 50% of dollars I spent to buy it, I did that because of the fact how hugely disappointed I was with this book.  Not sure if anyone of the people, who have written great reviews for this book on the web site of 37signals, have even read this book or have just wrote good words because they are friends with the Authors.<br /><br />This book reminds me of M. Night Shyamalan, the director of movie Sixth Sense, how that movie built huge expectations in audiences from him, and he has only let down his audiences gradually after Sixth Sense. 37Signals needs to \\"Get real\\" and do something substantial instead of re-packaging old-stuff in new book.

0240810961|5.0|Excellent compilation! Great insight into the process of the instructor to get the animators to see the 'big picture' when honing skills to draw for animation!   See what Bird, Lasseter, Burton and Keane were shown and taught when they were beginning their animation careers.   Packed with notes and drawings, the direction of these handouts is a valuable and educational book for the aspiring animator, but will probably hold no appeal for anyone with just a passing interest in the processes behind animation.   Highly recommended for animators, though!

0375842209|5.0|To say this book is a great children's novel, would be unfair. This book could easily impress anyone who picked it up and decided to read it. The theme of the story, and the way it's written in a straight forward style, is a neat way to connect with the reader. Zusak tells you exactly what's going to happen from the beginning, but as you read the story and fall in love with all of his brilliant characters you find yourself hoping that just maybe he wasn't being honest with you in the first place. I love this book very much. I have a nice little book collection, and after borrowing it from my sister (who also loved the book) I decided I need a copy of my very own. I would recommend this story to anyone, young or old, because I really feel that this book is so much more that a children's story. So if you're contemplating whether or not to buy it, or even just read it, I would recommend you do so. You'll be missing out on a great story otherwise... At the very least, I hope this review helps! [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]]
B001VLBDD0|5.0|The was a version that I had not seen before that included scenes I had never seen before. It gave insights to the plot that made sense. It was one of the first movies I had seen that featured excellent computerized special effects. It is a classic and I will watch it over and over.
6305537321|2.0|Bad movies start with bad casting. Audrey Hepburn simply isn't credible as a hooker, high-class or not. This role should have gone to someone like Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth (the love goddess), or Kim Novak. Hepburn may have charm, but she isn't sexy. Her figure isn't credible (she had height but no curves) and her face isn't DDG. Even her hair isn't particularly hot. But so many men want to be with her? Yeah, right. Whatever.    Audrey does have an effortless way about her in this film but gradually it wears on you because she goes on and on and on, rambling ad nauseam. You want to say to her, STFU already!    This film has been called a romantic comedy but it really isn't very romantic, and the comedy is weak sauce. Holly Golightly (sounds like a James Bond girl, right?) isn't very attractive (physically, emotionally, and lacks character); so the \\"attraction\\" in this pseudo romance is because Peppard feels sorry for her and sees her as a lost puppy he could rescue.    It's not really a drama, either, because there's almost no tension. That leaves the dialogue which is mostly a monologue--Golightly speaking lightly about anything and everything that pops into her ditzy head as soon as she thinks of it--just rambling.    You feel like you're tagging along to watch a boring person's life and listen to her describe it in boring fashion.    The film fails because it isn't romantic enough; it's not sexy enough; and it's not funny enough.    Pretty Woman with Julia Roberts had the high-class hooker who meets the perfect gentleman who can turn her life around. This one has two degenerates, which is one too many.    Moon River is nice but one short song doesn't save a bland movie.    \\"Oh golly gee, damn!\\" ~From the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's, 1961, spoken by the character Holly Golightly
0792844882|3.0|If you ever wondered what Elizabeth Berkley (former star of the TV series \\"Saved By The Bell\\") looks like naked, then buy this movie. If you are not able to buy porn yet, and you are a high school kid, this is where to start your smut collection! She looks athletically fit, yet not overly muscular. Greek goddess statues are jealous. If your girlfriend is fat, she will hate the bit*h, and she will be offended, and you will be drooling behind her back... lol...<br />Oh yeah, and the dialogue in this film is hilarious! The acting is hilarious! You can tell the actors are trying to be serious, but it fails on all levels. There are so many nude scenes that \\"gratuitous\\" cannot begin to describe it. Like an old 1980's horror flick level of nudity times 10!<br />This is far better than Striptease with Demi Moore. There is hardly any nudity and it is just not as much fun! You have to use the \\"pause\\" button too much to get some great views of Demi's great rack! Both movies were released in theaters around the same time.. seeming to attempt to cash-in on the stripper craze.. if there ever was one?<br />I seen a Lifetime network movie (strictly to please my woman) and Elizabeth Berkley was in it. She looks better than ever. Showgirls was a \\"semi-movie-career-killer\\" for her. I am glad to see she is back on TV.<br /><br />Bottom line: Showgirls is so bad, it is good! Fat Chicks.. beware!
067101756X|5.0|This book leaves nobody indifferent.    Phillip Corso was obviously steadfast to leave a brilliant legacy to his grandchildren and next generations.  You cannot understand a great deal of twentieth century, unless you have a good overview of this book. Corso and his partner make a very good job trying to compile more than 25 years plent of crucial events is History. Yes, Roswell was a fact, yes US back-engineered those bizarre gadgets, and yes many stupid things were made on behalf of national security.    If you have not git these book then your library is uncomplete.
0896898288|5.0|I absolutely love the book.  If you are a non-quilting historian that simply loves to read about the topic of the life of a farmer's wife, this is an excellent read.  If you are a quilter that loves to challenge yourself with hand or paper piecing, well, this is for you also.  I group this book on my shelf next to Brenda Papadakis' 'Dear Jane', and 'Dear Hannah', Liz Lois' 'Nearly Insane', and Judy Garden's 'Dutch Treat' to name a few.  Farmer's wife is exactly like these other books in that there are no instructions to make each block.  So, if you are not familiar with drafting quilt blocks, you might have a little trouble.  With that being said, there are no applique blocks for those of you that are faint of heart.  The blocks are not overly intricate compared to other similar quilts.  Many of them can be paper-pieced.  If you dreamed of doing a Dear Jane quilt or a Nearly Insane quilt for example, this would be a good warm-up project for you.
0805091742|5.0|This book is very well done and has brought together some very significant points.  Well written and supported by accurate and current case studies.  The subject matter and approach to correcting (or not creating!) problems in my work place has already begun.  Highly recommend this book to anyone who works in the marine transportation industry where the principles of Bridge Resource Management (reduction of one person or human error) are necessary.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade never records an album until it is perfect. It may take a while in between, but you can always be sure of being swept away with her magnificent smootheness and polish.  Being a representative of one of the world's most famous Blended Scotch Whisky brands, whose job is to give tastings, I always compare Blue Label to a Sade song, as the definition and personification of Smoothe.

0375854819|3.0|The third in the series, it is as captivating as the other two and managed to hold my interest. The way the story is told brings the characters to life and makes them appear almost real. There is a lot of violence in the story-almost a little bit too much for my taste.<br />Eragon presents as a strong hero, fighting for his beliefs and trying to fullfill his promises and tasks. I was anxiously waiting for the final battle between Eragon and Galbatorix to bring the story to it's climax and a grand ending. I wanted to see Eragon succeed and good win over evil.<br />It will be hard for the author to keep the story going in yet another book in the series without dragging it out and causing it to become too predictable and boring.<br />All in all I enjoyed reading all three books in the series.
B002BW7A58|2.0|When Lil' Wayne decided to experiment with the rock album \\"Rebirth\\", I thought if he can do well with this then he is definitely the top rapper in the game. I immediately thought that a Rage Against The Machine or Limp Bizkit sound mixed with Weezy's raspy voice would be a perfect blend. After all its not like this rock/rap collab hasn't been successful in the past. But something went wrong. This album has been delayed for almost a year. It almost hit \\"Detox\\" status before it finally dropped.  And now \\"Rebirth\\" is here but does anyone really care anymore.<br /><br />This album is definitely an experimental album, similar to Kanye West's \\"808's & Heartbreak\\". Weezy used Auto-tune throughout the album the same way Kanye did.  However, he actually managed to make some good music and Lil' Wayne's \\"Rebirth\\" is just comical. Songs like \\"Ground Zero & Da Da Da\\" were laughable. \\"Paradise\\" is Weezy's poor attempt at a love song which has him singing (yes singing) the whole song in Auto-tune. And \\"Knockout & The Price Is Wrong\\" were unbelievably bad. I really wonder what he was thinking with those two. Another problem is that you don't know what rock direction he's going to go from one song to the next. One minute he sounds like 3 Doors Down (\\"Runnin\\") and the next it's the B'52's (\\"Get A Life\\"). This inconsistency is what brings the album down. But when Lil' Wayne finally raps in his usual flow, that's when you get to see the potential of this album. \\"One Way Trip\\" shows what this album could have been. But the absolute gem of this album is \\"Drop The World\\". It features Weezy and Eminem flowing about world problems over a sick beat. You want more of this but unfortunately you will be left wanting more.<br /><br />This album is an absolute disappointment. I know Lil' Wayne wanted to drop something before his bid in jail. But this is not the way he wanted to go out. The difference between this and \\"808's & Heartbreak\\" is that Kanye used his emotion and personal struggles to make a powerful statement album. Lil' Wayne just got high, heard some Evanescence and decided to make a rock album with no knowledge of what he was doing. Now I hear rumors that his next album will be an R&B album before he drops \\"The Carter IV\\". Just like this album, it might sound good on paper but as any athlete knows, you don't win championships on paper.atement album.

But why was \\"Voodoo Chile (slight return)\\" from this event left off the concert CD? That puzzles me. Other than that, this is a terrific album!!! Stevie will always be #1 in my heart. His music is just as alive and exciting to me now as it ever was, and this was truly a momentous moment in his life, and I'm so grateful to be able to share in the joy! Love it!  Love you Stevie!
B00004XQ83|4.0|I very much enjoyed this movie and the music in it.  Normally I don't buy soundtrack albums as I'd rather just buy the artist's original albums, but most of my favorite songs from this movie were done just for the movie and not available elsewhere.  Down In The River To Pray is just hauntingly beautiful.  My other favorite song here is I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow, of which there are two renditions on the album.  Both are excellent.  Nearly everything else on the album is enjoyable as well.  If you enjoyed the movie you'll love this album.
B000H305U0|5.0|I got this when it first came out in 2006. Every single song is really enjoyable. Justin brought his best on this album. Even though it's four years old, I never get tired of listening to it. I love how the songs flow into each other so smoothly. I'm not a hardcore music person, but the songs on this album are some of the best I've heard in the last ten years.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with JT, he's just awesome.
0810988232|5.0|I just received this deck today, though I ordered it quite a while ago.  Not the fault of anyone other than the US Postal Service.  In fact, the day I got the deck in the mail, I went to a local bookstore and bought the deck, thinking I would return the other deck if it ever showed up.  My town's post office told me it was lost.  When I got home from the bookstore with the new deck, there was the one I ordered from Amazon!  I now have two.  So I can't help but think that the Faeries are messing with me and having quite a laugh over this and my incredible impatience.  I decided to find a friend to take the other deck because it's just too good to return.  This deck is beautiful, magikal, and right on.  I took them out of the box and did a reading for someone and it was perfect for her question.  It was very easy for me to connect with the cards.  This deck is a little simpler to use than their first deck, though that one has been my favorite oracle type deck.  Since I read professionally, I'm going to study these cards, because as the previous review says, reading what is written in the book really does take it much deeper, though you don't necessarily have to memorize the definitions.  I hope to bring this amazing wisdom to my clients.  This deck fills in where traditional Tarot stops...and it also encourages your own connection with the Faeries and your own inner guidance.  A great deck, highly recommended.  Oh, I should also point out that the art is amazing, though that is a given!
1934030198|3.0|For the most part, I find this book very informative.  I am a beginning triathlete, and have switched over from road cycling.  This book can be for beginners if the book is read carefully.  There is a lot of information, but it is up to the reader to find what is applicable and useful.  Using this book as a basis of training will definitely help the athlete. Finally, the overall tone of the book is very wise: 'do only what you need to do in order to achieve'.    On the negative, I feel the author spends a little too much time selling his skewed slant on science.  In chapter two, he tells the NASA scientist/bumble bee story.  Unfortunately for the author, a little research would have exposed this as an urban legend.  The bumble bee doesn't fly because of its ignorance of physics; it flies because of the wing being a non-rigid body.  While this is a cute story, it's incorrect and not relevant.    Furthermore, the author states 'The best scientists in the world can take a group of the most fit athletes into state-of-the-art lab...and predict how they do, and fail miserably.'  This statement is an unsupported 'sweeping generalization'.  He goes on to state 'Labs are just not the real world of racing...'.  Finally, 'Unfortunately when it comes to contributing anything extraordinary to the training and techniques of athletes, science has a poor track record.'      These above statements diametrically oppose his others regarding the growth of knowledge in the fitness industry. 'The rate at which this type of knowledge continues to grow is staggering.  In the 1980's, science learned more about the human athlete than in the previous eight decades combined.'    I understand the author has a Masters Degree in Exercise Science.  Knowing this, the author should show more critical thinking toward the sciences. For a scientist, the whole world is a laboratory.  Most studies of exercise/motion are NOT theoretical in a pure sense.  Rather, they are experimental.  A scientist, outside the lab, is participating in observational or experimental science.  Whether the author realizes it or not, he himself acts as an observational/experimental scientist while compiling this data.  Furthermore, when a scientist uses 'the art' of this training he is also experimenting.  There are measurable results.    As illustrated above with the bumble bee story and in the examples of strides in exercise science, Mr Friel is entirely off base with regards to exercise science.  The 'growth of knowledge' did not come from the ether.  If there are fault with the science, it is almost always due to the author or scientist not asking the right questions.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I had never heard of this documentary until I stumbled upon it on CNET's top 40 must own blu ray discs. I moved it straight to the top of my Netflix queue to see what they were raving about. When Baraka starts, it puts you near the top of the Himalaya Mountains and I thought, \\"Oh this is nice, like Planet Earth with no words, I wonder how long this is...\\". Then it depicts a baboon in a hot spring...WOW! The video quality in this scene is PHENOMENAL! I literally felt 'there' and wanted to dip my feet in the hot spring. From there, 'Baraka' takes you on a journey across the globe, visiting hidden cultures and places, along with some well known places such as Hong Kong and NYC. Clearly it wanted to show the extremes between modern and undeveloped cultures. I loved the photography in this film; every view has a purpose and tells a story. The transfer to blu ray is fantastic! With sharp details, accurate colors, and a great sense of depth and scope, the video is easily one of the best I've seen on blu ray. The audio ranks right up there with the video. The musical score of the film further extends the photography beyond the screen. Depth and clarity of the audio gives it the purest sounding audio track I've ever heard. I got lost in this film within the first few minutes, and I only found my way back when the credits rolled. I would recommend 'Baraka' to everyone. Documentary, audio, and video enthusiasts will especially enjoy this film.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. are totally awesome in this flick! It's a different take on the famous fictional detective, but it has class! There is humor and the directing and writing were fantastic! This movie should have received much more acclaim than it did. If RDJ keeps getting roles like this and pulling them off like he does, he will get a Best Actor oscar...It is long overdue, in my opinion. He has range and talent--and doesn't play the same characters again and again!

B0034JKZ3G|5.0|This movie exceeded all expectations. It is visually stunning, musically a work of genius, thematically sophisticated, and story-wise told in a refreshingly different way (some actions are pre-motivation) which makes the ride an unpredictable one.<br /><br />Visually, Disney has gone above and beyond. They have invoked the steamy feeling of the city of New Orleans in shades of gold and lavender, and in the swamp scenes, some of the backgrounds are so expertly rendered it's like you're looking at a photograph. But what stood out the most with this artwork was the colors. They are a study in thematic contrast. In the scenes with the villain, the bright colors of Mardi Gras are used to reveal a darker, sinister side. The effect is wonderfully jarring and creates an appropriate emotional response: rather than hating the villain, we're led to mistrust him. He's pretty on the outside, but there's something awful lurking underneath. It's like that sixth sense you get sometimes with certain people in your life. In Mama Odie's scene, the color scheme is subtle and muted--until she reveals her inner goodness, and the scene explodes with color; another comment on how purity can hide in the most surprising places.<br /><br />To say that once again Randy Newman has done an expert job with the music would be an understatement. He had a lot to work with here--the musical tapestry of New Orleans is a mix of Dixieland, Zydeco, and Spiritual. He could have easily chosen one of those styles and stuck with it--instead, he blends all three, and the effect is seamless. The musical numbers tend to stay in one vein or the other depending on the character - which also works to help tell the story -- but the underlying score, while you'll instantly recognize Newman's hallmark sound, is a genius integration. To top it off, because this film takes place in the golden age of jazz, he has deftly inserted musical references to Gershwin. Amazing. With so much to work with, it could have easily been a confusing or even chaotic train-wreck. Not in his hands.<br /><br />Thematically, this film has taken some of Disney's classic themes and examined them more deeply: they are two-sided and complex. The choices these characters make are never easy--more so than in other films--and that updates these themes so that modern audiences can more readily identify. Similarly, Disney's newest princess, Tiana, is the strongest, most interesting princess to date. She is intelligent, complex - and oozes passion, something that, in my opinion, has only been approached (and I do insist, \\"approached\\") in Belle and Ariel. Tiana is a princess for today's woman. Little girls of the world have quite an exciting and refreshing new role model.<br /><br />Disney's writers have chosen to tell this story in a different way, as well. It's not your typical spell-it-all-out up-front story, and some story elements are never even vocalized, they're visual, and back story and motivation are sometimes revealed after the relevant action rather than before. It was really refreshing to see Disney choose a slightly different construction--it leads to keeping the tale unpredictable and much more engaging. But I'm a writer, so I know it's hard to do this well. For the most part, Disney succeeds. However, there is a bit of a downside to this. Constructing a story in this manner can lead to a lot of subtlety in the way the story is told, and because of this, some of the characters' motives are not always clear right away. This seems to happen the most with Dr. Facilier, the villain. When he's on the screen, it's really important to concentrate or you might miss some key story elements.<br /><br />All in all, don't miss The Princess and the Frog. It's the best 97 minutes I've spent in a theater in a long, long time.

B0013ND30W|5.0|Sleeping Beauty was my all time favorite Disney film. I was so in love with this story, it's crazy how many times I wore out the VHS. But growing up, I lost touch with the story, but I recently bought the Blu-Ray and re-watched the film and you know what? I'm still in love with this movie. I really miss these old Disney movies where the animation was so bright and beautiful, the characters were so lovable, and the story was so magical. I'm not bashing Disney films from today, just I'm sure we could all relate on this subject where the older Disney films just had a certain charm about it. Sleeping Beauty is just a timeless story and has so much wonderful romance, I guess since I'm a girl, I just couldn't help but still be in love with this beautiful story.    Princess Aurora is born and is the future queen of her land, three fairy's, Flora, Merryweather, and Fauna bless her with three gifts: beauty and song, right as Merryweather is about to bless Aurora, the evil witch, Maleficent, comes in and curses Aurora that she shall touch a spinning wheel by her 16th birthday and die! Merryweather changes it to where she won't die, but sleep and could only be woke up by the kiss of true love. The fairy's wish to keep this from happening still, so they take Aurora and raise her as their own. One day Aurora on her 16th birthday goes out in the forest and meets the charming and handsome Prince Phillipe, but she doesn't know he's a prince and she doesn't know he's fhe man she's actually betrothed too. She is told by the fairy's that she can never see him again and that she's a princess; later that night the curse happens! Now the fairy's need Phillipe to save Aurora before it's too late.    Everything about Sleeping Beauty is just a perfect Disney film and I can't wait until to show this to my future kids one day. I know that their generation is going to have just the CGI animation, so it's good that at least we still have these films, they're treasures. The voices, the animation, the story, Sleeping Beauty is the most romantic fairy tale that anyone could easily fall in love with. If you are a Disney fan, this is a must see, it's a great family film or if you're just a film buff in general, I'm a grown up and I still tear up when I watch Sleeping Beauty.
B00020PLRU|5.0|Okay this is a very long review because I have so much to say so if you don't like long, detailed reviews, please just skip this. I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have to point out a few things that I've noticed in other reviews:<br /><br />This is not a rap-rock band! Please stop saying this. They are a gothic rock/metal band. There's no rap here. They don't sound anything like Linkin Park and I know since I've owned Linkin Park CDs and they are completely different bands. So please stop comparing the two. It's very frustrating reading this which isn't true. Linkin Park don't even have any gothic sounds in their music anyway.<br /><br />Well, I have always loved the 80's music for so long and pretty much that was all I've ever listed to for the most part. When it came to rock music anyway. I love the bands like Def Leppard, Whitesnake, and Guns N Roses and never got into the whole grunge genre and nu-metal. In the early 00's, I discovered power metal bands like Dream Theater and Blind Guardian. I was never into bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam that much.<br /><br />So when I would see Evanescence with \\"My Immortal\\" on MTV years ago, at first I ignored it because I thought Evanescence were going to sound grunge which I hate. But after hearing that \\"My Immortal\\" song several times, I got curious and decided to buy the Fallen album (which I have more than one copy of now) and when I heard the entire album I was really, really surprised. Not only did they not sound like any other band I ever heard but they incorporated these elements that I've always loved: gothic sounds. I've always loved the gothic sounds and atmosphere. One of my favorite video game series is Castlevania which uses a lot of the gothic style so of course it was only a matter of time before I would fall in love with Fallen.<br /><br />My favorite song has always been Tourniquet and I just love everything about that song. It really speaks to me and I can totally relate to it. I cannot express how much I love that song.<br /><br />Bring Me To Life has an awesome message about getting back into life. It's hard to explain but I feel it represents how I've been feeling as well.<br /><br />I love how Haunted really sounds haunted. LOL! It's such a masterpiece and I just love the message about not letting someone get away with these things they're not supposed to. That's how I feel about it anyway. I just love how unique this song is.<br /><br />Everybody's Fool is a total masterpiece!! I love the part \\"without the mask.....\\"<br /><br />Hello is a very emotional and sad song which I love and to me, it's about one or two things. Either it can be about someone who feels dead inside and their voice is talking to them or it can be about someone who has lost someone and they tell themselves not to cry and all that. This is just how I hear it. Of course, it might be something different to the band. A lot of times when I hear it, I start to cry. I love how it also has a really creepy feel to it as well.<br /><br />Imaginary is another very unique song that I love. It's really hard to describe because it doesn't sound like anything else.<br /><br />That's one thing that really makes Evanescence stand out. No two songs sound exactly alike. Even when you compare two very gothic sounding songs of theirs, they are never exactly alike. Something that makes Evanescence so unique.<br /><br />Of course My Immortal I love, both versions on this album. There's the piano version and the rock version at the end of the CD. I love both but the rock version with drums and guitars I love a little more. I love the whole message of this song. The lyrics are so beautiful.<br /><br />My Last Breath is another amazing track, I just love it!! Same with Going Under.<br /><br />Taking Over, once again another awesome song, and again, it's different from the rest, like all the songs.<br /><br />Whisper is amazing!! So awesome!!<br /><br />It's really hard to put all my feelings into this review because I've never felt so overwhelmed by a band before, not even Def Leppard who are my #1 favorite band of all time. I just cannot express enough how much I love this band and album.<br /><br />About a year ago, I discovered all their unreleased material that many people don't even know about. Oh My God!! If you have not yet heard these masterpieces, please check them out right away!<br /><br />There are so many unreleased demos and material that hasn't been released and I hope one day all this stuff will be released because many of the unreleased songs are better than the official material and so many people are really missing out. Believe me, if you hear their whole entire discography, like I have, many of these reviews bashing Evanescence will no longer be the case. Well, even just judging from Fallen, I have no complaints whatsoever but I mean the people who aren't reviewing the album but bashing Evanescence, the band. So I HIGHLY suggest checking out all their material, both unreleased and released before judging because they are far deeper than what you hear on Fallen or even The Open Door.<br /><br />I love The Open Door as well but my faves of all time are the unreleased stuff and Fallen. But Lacrymosa is another all time favorite for me. I love Good Enough too. I just love it all!! And I love how every song is different and the whole gothic sounds/elements. I can hear this all day and never get bored.<br /><br />Since I've gotten into Evanescence, Within Temptation have become my all time favorite gothic rock/metal band along with Evanescence. Delain and Nightwish are must haves as well. Delain's Lucidity and Nightwish's Once albums are total masterpieces!!<br /><br />So after all this, you can imagine how sad I am that Amy Lee is the only member left of Evanescence. It's so very sad and I can only hope one day all the original members will be together again. Speaking of together again, another masterpiece I love!<br /><br />One final thing I wanted to say: While my favorite bands of all time have always been from the 80's, I can't help but feel closer to Within Temptation, Evanescence, Delain, and Nightwish in many ways. It's not easy to say this because I've always loved the 80's and still do but a part of me feels more free from hearing these bands. Like Within Temptation's Pale and Evanescence's My Tourniquet and many more from them. I can relate so well to the lyrics in so many of these songs verses a lot of the 80's about just partying. I love the 80's of course and Def Leppard will always be my favorite band for the most part but there will always be a part of me that loves these other bands (Within Temptation, Evanescence, Delain, and Nightwish more.) The music just speaks to me. Especially in Within Temptation and Evanescence songs. Oh and of course Amy Lee and Sharon Den Adel have such amazing voices!!time.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|There isn't much that hasn't already been said about \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\", Walt Disney's first feature length animated film. Suffice it to say that it not only fulfilled the studio's hopes beyond their wildest dreams, it made possible the Disney films that followed it. From the famous Grimm fairy tale about a beautiful princess who flees her jealous stepmother and finds refuge with seven friendly dwarfs, Walt Disney created a cinematic milestone. At the time the film was in production until the day it was released, rival producers were referring to it as \\"Disney's Folly\\". The sneering stopped when it was embraced both by critics and audiences, grossing many times it's then record (for an animated film) $1.5 million budget. Eight successful reissues have kept the movie in the public consciousness now for over six decades, during which time the field of animation has grown by leaps and bounds. Still. despite the cinematic advances and the passage of time, \\"Snow White\\" stands alone. While the classic story is but a framework for the film (a fact which troubled me for years), \\"Snow White\\" can be fully enjoyed for the pioneer it truly is.<br /><br />Along with a splendid cast of voices headed by Adriana Caselotti (Snow White) Harry Stockwell (father of Guy and Dean, as the Prince) and Lucille La Verne (The Queen), there are songs which can truly be called timeless: \\"Whistle While You Work\\", \\"Heigh Ho\\", \\"Some Day My Prince Will Come\\", etc.). Much time and effort went toward developing the characters of the Seven Dwarfs and giving each a distinct personality (absent in the original story) which went a long way in making audiences care for Snow White's plight. Interestingly enough, although the fairy tale was toned down considerably to make it more \\"family friendly\\", the overzealous way in which the film makers transformed the Wicked Queen into a hideous hag at the climax was the subject of an incredible amount of controversy at the time. In fact, it was under a partial ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age! Nevertheless, it was the recipient of a special Academy Award in 1938.<br /><br />To go on about the impact made by the film would be redundant. It simply must be seen to be appreciated. In 2001, it was released on DVD as the first of Disney's \\"Diamond Editions\\". And many months before it was in stores, there was great speculation about the content. All the anticipation was justified when the DVD hit the stores. Critics and consumers were overwhelmed (just like the audiences back in 1937) with both the content and the painstaking restoration (beyond that done for it's 60th anniversary reissue) and made it THE Bluray for the subsequent holiday season. Without going into detail, it looks as if it were made yesterday, and sounds better than a film of this vintage could ever be expected to. But the streamlining has not diminished it's charm--only accentuated it. And when you think (before you are drawn into the story, and you ARE) that \\"Snow White\\", unlike today's computer-drawn animated features was entirely done by hand, that makes it even more of a miracle. Instead of listing the already well publicized bonus features, let me say that this \\"Platinum Edition\\" is like a self-contained history of the film, with hours worth of delights the most astounding being a pieced-together commentary by Walt Disney himself. Out of print for years, it is well worth the effort and expense to find. And although Disney made it a point to announce that they planned to go even further with their subsequent \\"Diamond Editions\\", Next up Beauty And The Beast October 5th!!l ban in England which made it off-limits to children under 16 years of age!

B0000AFONX|5.0|Okay this is a very long review because I have so much to say so if you don't like long, detailed reviews, please just skip this. I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have to point out a few things that I've noticed in other reviews:<br /><br />This is not a rap-rock band! Please stop saying this. They are a gothic rock/metal band. There's no rap here. They don't sound anything like Linkin Park and I know since I've owned Linkin Park CDs and they are completely different bands. So please stop comparing the two. It's very frustrating reading this which isn't true. Linkin Park don't even have any gothic sounds in their music anyway.<br /><br />Well, I have always loved the 80's music for so long and pretty much that was all I've ever listed to for the most part. When it came to rock music anyway. I love the bands like Def Leppard, Whitesnake, and Guns N Roses and never got into the whole grunge genre and nu-metal. In the early 00's, I discovered power metal bands like Dream Theater and Blind Guardian. I was never into bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam that much.<br /><br />So when I would see Evanescence with \\"My Immortal\\" on MTV years ago, at first I ignored it because I thought Evanescence were going to sound grunge which I hate. But after hearing that \\"My Immortal\\" song several times, I got curious and decided to buy the Fallen album (which I have more than one copy of now) and when I heard the entire album I was really, really surprised. Not only did they not sound like any other band I ever heard but they incorporated these elements that I've always loved: gothic sounds. I've always loved the gothic sounds and atmosphere. One of my favorite video game series is Castlevania which uses a lot of the gothic style so of course it was only a matter of time before I would fall in love with Fallen.<br /><br />My favorite song has always been Tourniquet and I just love everything about that song. It really speaks to me and I can totally relate to it. I cannot express how much I love that song.<br /><br />Bring Me To Life has an awesome message about getting back into life. It's hard to explain but I feel it represents how I've been feeling as well.<br /><br />I love how Haunted really sounds haunted. LOL! It's such a masterpiece and I just love the message about not letting someone get away with these things they're not supposed to. That's how I feel about it anyway. I just love how unique this song is.<br /><br />Everybody's Fool is a total masterpiece!! I love the part \\"without the mask.....\\"<br /><br />Hello is a very emotional and sad song which I love and to me, it's about one or two things. Either it can be about someone who feels dead inside and their voice is talking to them or it can be about someone who has lost someone and they tell themselves not to cry and all that. This is just how I hear it. Of course, it might be something different to the band. A lot of times when I hear it, I start to cry. I love how it also has a really creepy feel to it as well.<br /><br />Imaginary is another very unique song that I love. It's really hard to describe because it doesn't sound like anything else.<br /><br />That's one thing that really makes Evanescence stand out. No two songs sound exactly alike.

It actually is an unreleased track.<br /><br />It's really hard to put all my feelings into this review because I've never felt so overwhelmed by a band before, not even Def Leppard who are my #1 favorite band of all time.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|After watching Emma on Masterpiece Theater, I could not wait to get my own copy!  The detail to this version is just wonderful, right down to the landscapes, interiors and costumes.  Romola Garai is the perfect Emma, out shining all others who have played Jane Austen's clueless young matchmaker.  Loved it.
0743437497|2.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors of all time.  I have many of his books and collections.  Most of the time when I read his books, I like the book more than the movie version.  Just because there's so much more going on in the book than you can see in the movie.  So before I read this book, I heard how awesome the book was and how much better it was than the Kubrick film.  I even heard that in the book, in the hedge maze, the plants come to life.  But either they got confused with the hedge animals in the book or they were thinking of something else completely different.  But I was so looking forward to a really scary story in the book.  It turned out to be the biggest disappointment from King.<br /><br />There was too much reading about alcoholism and looking through papers in the basement verses the really scary scenarios you see in the Kubrick film.  There was no hedge maze but just hedge animals which really isn't as interesting to me.  The only interesting part about that was the animals seemed to be alive.<br /><br />Then there were other things like just too much drama going on instead of the whole creepy, scary factor.  I wanted to be scared like I get while watching the film but never was.  I just don't know why so many people prefer the book to the film.  Years later, King had his own mini-series which is just a tad better than the book since it takes less effort to watch that and less time to read the book.<br /><br />I'm sorry but I just can't understand the appeal and all the praise of the book.  Kubrick really turned this boring book into a frightfest.  I can watch that film over and over again, and have many times already.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I have loved Jane Austen for over 25 years.  Like the girl in the movie, I would rather sit home reading Pride and Prejudice then go out.  The twists in the story would I'm sure cause Jane Austen to quake, but I found them very refreshing.  It is not the A&E version, but it was a delight to watch.

B00127RAJY|5.0|If you want a good workout get any of Jillian Michaels workout DVD's.  I go to the gym 6 days a week but decided that I wanted to switch it up so I ordered her DVD's.  I am absolutley in love with them all.  She does such a great job in the workout.  It kicks my butt!  I can see a big difference in my body and it is finally toning.  It can be hard but push through and you will feel great.  BUY IT!!
B002LFIZEU|5.0|Okay this is a very long review because I have so much to say so if you don't like long, detailed reviews, please just skip this. I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />First, I have to point out a few things that I've noticed in other reviews:<br /><br />This is not a rap-rock band! Please stop saying this. They are a gothic rock/metal band. There's no rap here. They don't sound anything like Linkin Park and I know since I've owned Linkin Park CDs and they are completely different bands. So please stop comparing the two. It's very frustrating reading this which isn't true. Linkin Park don't even have any gothic sounds in their music anyway.<br /><br />Well, I have always loved the 80's music for so long and pretty much that was all I've ever listed to for the most part. When it came to rock music anyway. I love the bands like Def Leppard, Whitesnake, and Guns N Roses and never got into the whole grunge genre and nu-metal. In the early 00's, I discovered power metal bands like Dream Theater and Blind Guardian. I was never into bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam that much.<br /><br />So when I would see Evanescence with \\"My Immortal\\" on MTV years ago, at first I ignored it because I thought Evanescence were going to sound grunge which I hate. But after hearing that \\"My Immortal\\" song several times, I got curious and decided to buy the Fallen album (which I have more than one copy of now) and when I heard the entire album I was really, really surprised. Not only did they not sound like any other band I ever heard but they incorporated these elements that I've always loved: gothic sounds. I've always loved the gothic sounds and atmosphere. One of my favorite video game series is Castlevania which uses a lot of the gothic style so of course it was only a matter of time before I would fall in love with Fallen.<br /><br />My favorite song has always been Tourniquet and I just love everything about that song. It really speaks to me and I can totally relate to it. I cannot express how much I love that song.<br /><br />Bring Me To Life has an awesome message about getting back into life. It's hard to explain but I feel it represents how I've been feeling as well.<br /><br />I love how Haunted really sounds haunted. LOL! It's such a masterpiece and I just love the message about not letting someone get away with these things they're not supposed to. That's how I feel about it anyway. I just love how unique this song is.<br /><br />Everybody's Fool is a total masterpiece!! I love the part \\"without the mask.....\\"<br /><br />Hello is a very emotional and sad song which I love and to me, it's about one or two things. Either it can be about someone who feels dead inside and their voice is talking to them or it can be about someone who has lost someone and they tell themselves not to cry and all that. This is just how I hear it. Of course, it might be something different to the band. A lot of times when I hear it, I start to cry. I love how it also has a really creepy feel to it as well.<br /><br />Imaginary is another very unique song that I love. It's really hard to describe because it doesn't sound like anything else.<br /><br />That's one thing that really makes Evanescence stand out. No two songs sound exactly alike. Even when you compare two very gothic sounding songs of theirs, they are never exactly alike. Something that makes Evanescence so unique.<br /><br />Of course My Immortal I love, both versions on this album. There's the piano version and the rock version at the end of the CD. I love both but the rock version with drums and guitars I love a little more. I love the whole message of this song. The lyrics are so beautiful.<br /><br />My Last Breath is another amazing track, I just love it!! Same with Going Under.<br /><br />Taking Over, once again another awesome song, and again, it's different from the rest, like all the songs.<br /><br />Whisper is amazing!! So awesome!!<br /><br />It's really hard to put all my feelings into this review because I've never felt so overwhelmed by a band before, not even Def Leppard who are my #1 favorite band of all time. I just cannot express enough how much I love this band and album.<br /><br />About a year ago, I discovered all their unreleased material that many people don't even know about. Oh My God!! If you have not yet heard these masterpieces, please check them out right away!<br /><br />There are so many unreleased demos and material that hasn't been released and I hope one day all this stuff will be released because many of the unreleased songs are better than the official material and so many people are really missing out. Believe me, if you hear their whole entire discography, like I have, many of these reviews bashing Evanescence will no longer be the case. Well, even just judging from Fallen, I have no complaints whatsoever but I mean the people who aren't reviewing the album but bashing Evanescence, the band. So I HIGHLY suggest checking out all their material, both unreleased and released before judging because they are far deeper than what you hear on Fallen or even The Open Door.<br /><br />I love The Open Door as well but my faves of all time are the unreleased stuff and Fallen. But Lacrymosa is another all time favorite for me. I love Good Enough too. I just love it all!! And I love how every song is different and the whole gothic sounds/elements. I can hear this all day and never get bored.<br /><br />Since I've gotten into Evanescence, Within Temptation have become my all time favorite gothic rock/metal band along with Evanescence. Delain and Nightwish are must haves as well. Delain's Lucidity and Nightwish's Once albums are total masterpieces!!<br /><br />So after all this, you can imagine how sad I am that Amy Lee is the only member left of Evanescence. It's so very sad and I can only hope one day all the original members will be together again. Speaking of together again, another masterpiece I love!<br /><br />One final thing I wanted to say: While my favorite bands of all time have always been from the 80's, I can't help but feel closer to Within Temptation, Evanescence, Delain, and Nightwish in many ways. It's not easy to say this because I've always loved the 80's and still do but a part of me feels more free from hearing these bands. Like Within Temptation's Pale and Evanescence's My Tourniquet and many more from them. I can relate so well to the lyrics in so many of these songs verses a lot of the 80's about just partying. I love the 80's of course and Def Leppard will always be my favorite band for the most part but there will always be a part of me that loves these other bands (Within Temptation, Evanescence, Delain, and Nightwish more.)

B002WY65VU|2.0|Actually, for both a zombie movie and a Woody Harrelson lover like myself, I found this film quite disappointing. I mean, some of the zombie stuff was quite good and some was quite funny, there just wasn't enough. But that's not what this film was really about and therein lies my disappointment. It was a teen romance movie plain and simple; it was just disguised as a zombie flick most likly to get folks like me to buy a ticket. That's why I'm having a problem with it. By the way, Woody was Woody and that's always good, and it was Woody, more than anything else, that got this film an extra star; in my humble opinion.

B00003CXCT|1.0|This product says \\"widescreen,\\" yet when you play it, it is NOT widescreen. In fact, it says \\"this picture has been modified to fit this screen.\\" I checked all the settings and it is nothing related to settings. This product is a rip-off. There is NOTHING widescreen about this film. I only bought it to fit my widescreen TV. I have thrown out the packaging (my mistake) so I am stuck with it. Warning: do not buy this if you want a full/wide screen.

B00004Y6OA|5.0|It's funny.  I own this in vinyl form somewhere in the stores of my old LPs but I haven't listened to it in almost 20 years.  Since then, and with the coming (and going) of Sammy Hagar, I always maintained that the two versions of Van Halen (I am blissfully ignoring the Cherone years) were to be considered as two different and distinct bands.  I see that now as a lame attempt to avoid making a choice of who was the better front man of VH.  After re-listening to this cd after so many years, I have easily made up my mind.  Not only were the David Lee Roth years of Van Halen the better years of the band, Women and Children First could be the best album they put forth.  I can finally put my mind at ease with this determination.  Now, who can help me with determining which singer of AC/DC was better?
B0011FTQ4O|2.0|Good if you're into lightweight fluff. I'm not. I've seen worse. It (more accurately, Kate Hudson, damn!) kept my interest to the end, but way too campy for my taste.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Good tv series love it especially how they spy on each other or watch when something happens its so amazing how the plot is set up and stuff.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|There are not too many people who have not seen or at least heard of this classic movie. Taking place in chic early 1960's NYC, Holly Golightly, played by the magnificent and lovely Audrey Hepburn, is a beautiful yet confusing young sophisticate looking for her way through life via chic parties and dating rich men. When she meets her new neighbor, Paul Varjak, a writer and kept man, played wonderfully by George Peppard, her world takes an unexpected turn but ever so slowly and with plenty of resistence by her own drive to marry any one of the world's richest men, whoever that will be.          Patricia Neal, a stylish gal herself, is writer Paul Varjak's lady friend and  'financiere' and Buddy Ebsen plays a long past husband of Holly who tries to take her back home. The cast is further blessed with terrific and amusing performances by Martin Balsam (as Holly's agent), John McGiver (as the staid Tiffany salesman) and Mickey Rooney, in a tongue-in-cheek impersonation of a Japanese photographer who is constantly pestered by neighbor Holly's life style and antics. Even 'Cat' has a key role in this classic.        The movie shows us NYC life in the early 60's and that alone is a treasure. Add to this the superb acting and terrific story line provided to us through Truman Capote's novella and you have a can't miss classic. The song classic 'Moon River' is born here as well, in a sweet scene between Holly and Paul.     Audrey is superbly gorgeous and stylish and Mr Peppard fits her perfectly.  The movie is a perfect blend of comedy, romance with some light hearted tension here and there. The final 5 minutes pull it all together in the way most of us want it to be, cat included!         You will love this classic!
B001OQCV2O|1.0|There have been a few comments in reviews about this movie being a simple popcorn flick and how, should you detach your brain for 3 hours you will manage to enjoy this monstrosity. Simply, that is not true, unless you're actually willing to run the risk of you being made more of an idiot by watching this movie and thinking \\"hmm, that was an enjoyable romp\\". Perhaps I did look too much into this movie and wanted it to have a good storyline that would at least captivate me without having to look at bizarre shiny things every 10 minutes to remind me of what movie I'm watching. I am even one of those guys who will be quite willing to poke a hole in his skull and flick that switch that says \\"you don't need me to enjoy this\\" but I really couldn't enjoy this piece of detritus left over from the imagination of the crazy person that brought us \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\". Even my rotting, mindless corpse struggled to find the enjoyment in this as every minute left me feeling more and more insulted by the garbage that was being spewed from the screen. The special effects guy, the man that seems to have worked so hard making the image of thousands of human lives appear disposable at the click of a mouse, in favour of a group of equally pointless human beings who had so many close shaves in this movie, it would make George Clooney wish he had a better razor, deserves applause as he has done a fantastic job.<br /><br />So the story begins with our unlikely hero, John Cusack, a pathetic limo driver who just wants to be as good a Dad as possible for his kids while his ex-wife and her new piece of meat get on with their lives. Now, more than ever, Daddy gets the chance to prove his worth by saving his kids, the ex and her man from the end of the world through awesome driving skills and lying to the kids that everything is going to be ok. On the other side of this story is a budding geologist, Chiwetel Ejiofor who discovers that because of that crazy thing called the Sun and the cool sounding Neutrino's the centre of our Earth is melting and there's F*** all we can do about it but hope to become ridiculously rich and buy our survival. You may be wondering how exactly John Cusack managed to survive this craziness; well it's pretty cool actually as clich&eacute;d crazy person, Woody Harrelson who's spouting the typical conspiracy \\"our government's hiding it from us\\" jolliness manages to get it right and because he manages to predict events correctly, Cusack decides that this crazy person is the key to survival.<br /><br />OK, there's a bit more to it than that. Actually there isn't, Danny Glover is president which is pretty cool and it takes on the typical of these types of garbage movies which is that humans aren't very nice people when it comes to surviving unless you're related in some genetic form. Then, if you're not related genetically, the amount of money you have matters the most. Ah Capitalism, how you make the world a better place. Wait, sorry I was making the film sound a bit more intelligent than it actually is for a second there. In fact, it's the most idiotic film imaginable. So much so, that the marketers capitalised on the idiocy of some people by creating a viral marketing campaign that made this whole thing seem real and that we were all really F***ed by December 21st 2012. I'll give it credit, the special effects are amazing, but the Roland Emmerich films are terrifying in a more deep seeded way as he's not just a guy who makes crappy big budget epics, but he's a man that makes movie that have the human race appear absolutely worthless and any depiction of mass slaughter on a scale such as this is to simply be labelled cool and nothing more. I'm sure I'm thinking too much into it, but this film insulted every facet of my intelligence.<br /><br />The acting, as could be expected was terrible. The amount of close calls our \\"heroes\\" had was terrible. Everything about this movie, aside from the chilling special effects was terrible.The shocking thing is that Emmerich's movies continue to make a profit time and time again thus meaning this man gets the opportunity to make more and more of this drivel. If you have any respect for your own sense of humanity, then you will keep away from this garbage for as long as humanly possible.Emmerich's movies continue to make a profit time and time again thus meaning this man gets the opportunity to make more and more of this drivel.

B000K7VHPU|5.0|This film is possibly one of the most under-rated piece of film art made in the recent past. It is a well mastered tale of suspense, interlaced with romance. Add some social class warfare and you should find something for most viewers. This is not a film that you put on unless you are willing to pay attention. The viewer really does need to pay attention, so if you play your videos just to make noise, then this one will lose you quickly.
B0030BOCEG|5.0|I have been listening to HIM for quite some time now and I have to say that this is the best record of their career. I know that most of the old die hard fans of the band will hate it, but thats okay. It is a great album and if you don't believe me listen to it yourself.
B0033AGPFS|5.0|The cover sticker promises an all-analog remaster by Jimi's original engineer (Eddie Kramer). It's two nice slabs of 180g vinyl and probably about the only way you can get a copy of Electric Ladyland in analog sound with no pops or crackles. This does have a bright clear sound, and I noticed a lot of detail I never noticed on my old Reprise vinyl copy. Still, this new version doesn't top the original -- analog or not, it's actually a bit too bright-sounding. I'm thinking Eddie Kramer at his age has likely lost some high end on his hearing, and so the new master seems to compensate by bringing out that sound -- it's not remixed, but somehow it accents the high end more. But as a Hendrix nut, I view this as an interesting \\"retake\\" -- a new way to hear an old favorite album. I know I'll go back to my Reprise copy more than this one, but I'm glad to have this one.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food, Inc. reminded my of the history courses I took covering the muck raking era in journalism during the late 1890's and turn of the 1900's. This video seems to be a balanced expose of corporate meat processing practices and the risks consumers face when they are \\"out of the loop\\" as to how our food(s) reach the table. Knowing your sources of supply contributes to our overall health.
0385504225|3.0|I'm only halfway through with the novel, but I'm ready to throw my hands up and completely surrender to the exasperating obtuseness of Robert Langdon.  There is not one chapter in this book that he is not shocked, stunned, or incredulous over the fact that the Legend of the Masonic Temple may actually be true! But why is he so unwilling to suspend his disbelief over this?  Yes, he is an academic and skeptic that only believes in tangible proof...but yea, I vaguely remember him being the one to discover Jesus Christ's last living descendant !! I'm only continuing on with the book because I'm still interested in the story, but definitely sick of the repetitive phrases and drawn out exposition.  And oh yea, Langdon is an idiot.
B002VECM6S|2.0|\\"Who'd have thought we'd have a black son before we knew a democrat? \\"    This line speaks volumes about the creators of this movie, so basically a black person is automatically a democrat, without volition on his own. Plus noting that Tennessee where 41% voted for Obama is where this movie takes place . This is just a white guilt, movie who all the ignorant white people who want to fall this. It insults black , white, and all others affect by suppression in a condescending manner. I wonder if people noticed the slaves in Spartacus, or the fact that Russia ended slavery only 2 weeks earlier then the US. If you worship hollywood then this is for you. Really if you going to liberal guilt, then this is for you. Its a total fantasy for those yearning for ignorance of history, and people who are black or white. Its a stereotype dream!

B001SN83KC|4.0|i totally loved this book but u r not sure if it is a happy or sad ending. if it is a happy ending and the aurther made it clear i would give this book 5 stars, but if it is a sad ending i would give the book 3. i just really wish i could know what happened!
B001P22HK8|2.0|Seriously, this has the worst ending to a book ever and I mean ever. I was riveted and read it in 2 days but then I am watching the percentage on the kindle creep up and thinking this better resolve real fast. Then, nothing, no closure, no clue as to what will happen. I was actually pissed when the pages ran out. It honestly felt like it was the first book in a trilogy and not a stand alone novel. Grrrrrr. Even if you take it that the Daemon won, you really don't know that for sure. Just a stupid ending.
B0030Y11XS|2.0|\\"Irony\\" is too tame a word to describe the experience of hearing a really rich filmmaker narrating in soft, soothing tones as he describes why the \\"rich\\" are bad.  Making a lot of money by getting childish leftists to hate their own culture seems to be what Moore does best, and here he almost becomes a parody of himself, if anyone is paying attention.<br /><br />But for those who weren't paying attention, here are some observations.<br /><br />First, Moore never really defines \\"capitalism\\" in this movie.  He just teaches why it is bad.  Why didn't he define it first?  I'm guessing that he is counting on the childish leftists to bring their own definition to the film.  They know capitalism is bad, and they just need to know why.<br /><br />So, what better way then to narrate them through a number of stories of \\"bad thing\\" happening, with little context or back story or history, and in each case purr in the chidrens' ears about how bad the big mean capitalist is.  Ooooh look children, these people got hurt.  Ooooh look children, there's the capitalist.  He's bad, isn't he children.<br /><br />Anyway, without wasting too much time on this example of transparently obvious propaganda, here are a few counterpoints.<br /><br />First, Moore did enlighten me to some bad stuff I didn't know about.  The corporations taking out life insurance policies on their employees being the worst to me, but I hardly think that this is motivated by \\"capitalism\\" but rather by greed and laws that allow it to happen.  The laws need to be changed, that's all.<br /><br />Second, Nobody is forcing pilots to fly passenger planes for $20,000 a year (or whatever).  Anyone bright enough to fly an airplane can get a job doing something else for more money.  So, they need to quit and go do something else.<br /><br />Third, Jesus said things that sound \\"capitalist\\" too, such as when He said that to him who has, more shall be given, and to he that has not, even what he thinks he has shall be taken from him.  Ooooh children, Jesus sounds \\"capitalist\\" there.  That wasn't in the movie!  Shocked I am!<br /><br />Cherry picking Jesus' words to make Him sound like He's on your side is as old as it is wrong, but it never ends.  There is no special place in Hell for \\"the rich\\".  Paul commanded the rich to be generous, not to become poor.  I do wonder if there might be a special place for those who twist Jesus' words for financial gain.  Hmmmmm.<br /><br />Fourth, do you know why the AIG bigwigs weren't on the tops of their roofs screaming for help after Hurricane Katrina?  Do you?  Well, like myself, and I'm guessing you, they didn't buy houses below sea level next to an ocean where it was known for many years that the area could not withstand a major hurricane. But the hurricane happened!  Just another reason to hate the capitalist!  Anyone thinking out there?<br /><br />Anyway, I could go on but I've wasted enough time already.  Time to leave my private property and drive to the privately owned company I work for.  Woe is me.here.  That wasn't in the movie!  Shocked I am!

0765350386|5.0|I agree with the other positive reviews.  I disagree with the criticism that the character development isn't very good.  To the contrary, it is quite good.  It just takes its time to develop throughout the book.    The author shares some of the strengths but none of the weaknesses of several other authors in this genre.  His intricate plot is worthy of Stephen Donaldson, but his character development is better.  His world is richly imagined, much like Robert Jordan and George R.R. Martin, but he avoids their penchant for circular and repetitive story lines, heraldry and clothing, walking and talking, and hundreds of superfluous characters.  He writes as cleanly as Terry Brooks without the preachiness.      Truly a breath of fresh air, and a page-turner to the end.
0307269981|5.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire was an exceptional read -- being the 2nd in a series it was just as good as the first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo, maybe even more so.  It was very fast paced and entertaining.  Best book I've read in years.  Can't say enough good things.
B002VECM4K|5.0|The movie was excellent. Very raw look at life from a perspective that is rarely taken. I highly recommend this movie and the book.
1416511946|5.0|This book was flat out AMAZING.      If you've ever want a true glimpse into a rockstars life, this is the book to read.    If you want a true gritty look to what it's like to be a hard core addict, this is the book to read.    If you just like to read, this is the book to read.    I remember watching an MTV or VH1 show about drugs and bands and seeing Nikki talk about the fateful night when he died only to come home and immediately shoot up again, waking up with the needle still in his arm.  So to read this book and see the road that brought him to that moment and hear it in more detail was really intriguing.  Not one point of this book disappointed me.    The book itself is a work of art.  The design of it paints the picture of a dark time and complements the storyline. It's obvious some serious heart and soul went into every part of this book. Even the paper is quality stuff.    What's really amazing about this book is how completely honest everyone is.  I really admire not just Nikki for being so open, but everyone involved.  I love how the entries from Nikki have additions of others who were there alongside him at that moment.  Not just Tommy, Mick and Vince but other artists like Slash or his mgmt team/family.  The Vanity ones are way out there...although I like the one where Niiki adds a \\"huh?\\" afterwards.  Nice!  But everyone is so brutally honest about what was happening then, not just to Nikki but their own involvement and doings.  And Nikki really let his emotions and true feelings be seen for what they are.  Even when he was a junkie at his worst, I found myself really admiring him for not lying to himself.  He is not a man of excuses.     I started high school to Shout at the Devil and Crue was my first \\"metal love\\" musically.  Their Decade to Decadence greatest hits CD is one of my all time fave metal CDs.  This book is set Dec 86 to Dec 87 which was my senior year.  It was really cool to think back as to what I remember going on in my life and thinking \\"wow...this is when this was going on\\".  I saw them in 2005 and I'm really glad I did.  Just like I'm really glad I found this book.

0316010669|3.0|After reading Malcolm Galdwell's first installment, [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]], I had some idea of what to expect from Blink; a lightweight and anecdote-laded book that appeals to a mainstream audience.<br /><br />Blink is about gut feel, snap judgments, first impressions, interpreting facial expressions (which Gladwell calls mind reading) and a little bit more.  Again, all backed by interesting stories of people and events more so than empirical research.<br /><br />The three tasks of Blink are:<br />1) Convince you that decisions made very quickly can be every bit as good as decisions made cautiously and deliberately.<br />2) Answers the question:  When should we trust our instincts and when should we be wary of them?<br />3) Convince you that our snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.<br /><br />These snap judgments and first impressions are what Gladwell refers to as \\"thin-slicing\\", meaning \\"...the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience.\\" (pg. 23).<br /><br />If you enjoyed the Tipping Point, then you'll certainly love Blink; more of the same Gladwell writing style and stories.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|I have been a die-hard Scorps fan for close to 30 years. This CD BLEW ME AWAY! I can't wait to see the farewell tour.<br /><br />Back to the CD...there is something for everyone. Hard rocking tunes such as \\"Raised on Rock\\" and Turn You On\\" will remind you of vintage Scorpions. There are also several ballads sung like only Klaus can achieve with his mesmerizing operatic voice. These include \\"Lorelei\\", \\"Sly\\" and \\"The Best is Yet to Come.\\"<br /><br />Long live the Scorpions!!!!!
B000002MIY|5.0|I had Kamakiriad on cassette and finally decided I needed the disc. This is my favorite Donald Fagan project and it's full of Jazz/Funk arrangements and riffs and is very smooth from beginning to end. My favorite songs are \\"Snowbound\\",the very laid back \\"Dunes\\" and the soulful \\"Tomorrows girls\\". There are even a couple of semi-danceable tunes(Trans-Island skyway and Springtime). This is by no means a Steely Dan rehash, it's vintage Fagan at his best and you can expect plenty of groovin' keyboards and tongue-in-check lyrics.This is great add to any collection.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|I heard a lot about this movie and I guess it held up to everything I heard...is it some heart stopping work of art, hell no!  But it is excellent in it's own way and well worth the price.  Strange as hell though.
0199206589|1.0|I got this book hoping it would provide a lucid and succinct introduction to an area which I am interested in but know little about as a discipline or theory - much as I had found in others in the series. Unfortunately this book doesn't seem to actually have been written as such an introductory piece, but seems rather to be a group of essays around a common theme, that were then vaguely stringed together.    Beginning with an introduction around an apparently \\"convoluted\\" history of the term... it was associated with colonialism and racism in general and Nazism in particular - that's about it. He then takes a glance at how it has since generally been vaguely appropriated as a short-hand, or the preserve of right-wing realists usually bent on cynical justifications of national agendas. The author criticises these groups for not being interested in the chequered history of 'geopolitics' as a term, and seems to think that this history is of great importance. However, is prattling on about how it used to be a bad term really useful? Especially when it really just comes down to \\"some Geopolitical theories are/were tainted with Social Darwinian views\\".    More recently, we are told there is also a minority of post-modernists who are more concerned with the discourses of culture (popular geopolitics - read cultural studies applied to international relations), identity politics (with particular regard to territorial boundaries), as well as critiquing Us/Them and over-simplifications in producing generalised templates of the world (e.g. 'Axis of Evil', but also 'Third World'). Tediously, and somewhat inevitably, it is claimed that these post-modernists are often 'attempting to liberate populations from oppressive geopolitical structures' (p.51) ... I'm sure that the lifting of this burden is seen as a great boon by those in the Third World...    It goes on, but it's not so much about Geopolitical theories as it is an opinion piece. It blurs critique of US foreign policy, with a cursory glance at the history of the 20th century and an exploration of some contemporary themes in the academic world such as Globalisation. There's even an exhortation to read the VSI on that very subject, which felt an awful lot like product placement. In a similar vein, the author also has the irritating habit of starting sentences with \\"as so-and-so opines\\" and the like, which are completely irrelevant and don't even come with citations (so they're not there for you to chase up that's for sure, more like obsequious nods to authority). It also makes obligatory post-modern references to \\"time/space\\" and how it has \\"contracted\\", which sounds grand but really just means our sense of distance has got smaller owing to developments in communication technology. Although I must say to his credit the obscurantism and abuse of language now so typical of academia isn't really evident outside these examples. As another poster said, it's more like a Guardian piece...    On the subject of its quality, I'm really very surprised this passed muster. It's certainly marred my otherwise good experience of the series, for example although I didn't think the one I read on Rousseau was fantastic either, at least it was coherent and served a purpose as an *introduction*. I was pretty much appalled by the error on page 128 which shows two maps supposedly representing Europe in 1914 and 1919. The errors are numerous, but particularly glaring, even from a quick glance, is the German-Polish border in each... Ironically this picture comes immediately after mentioning how American scholars had meticulously studied and gathered information on how to deal with that very border at the Paris Peace Conference. What were the QAs doing? What were the publisher and author doing? These maps can't even be explained as being \\"the wrong ones\\", they represent no time in history at all. It's as if they got half-way and just couldn't be arsed.    I was also frustrated that there was no attempt whatsoever to explain the concept of the supposedly pivotal \\"Heartland\\", or why anyone would ever think the region crucial to the past and future fates of the Great Powers, and echo other criticisms raised by the reviews on this site. I would agree that the bit about polar projections was interesting, but could have been dealt with in a lot less space.    It's not that there aren't interesting bits, it's just that it's not what was advertised. I'm not sure I wanted a book that comprised very brief summary of the development of the discipline (focused on its use as a *term*), coupled with a vague critique of US foreign policy since 1945, with some random contextual information thrown in about the formation and development of the Cold War order. The most useful thing about it really were the indirect references and insights into how postmodernism has affected the area - but even that is an all-too familiar story. I'd steer clear, and I may even complain to the OUP and ask for a refund.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|The quality concerns have been mentioned in other people's reviews and I bought it knowing what the quality was going to be like.  It was even worse than I expected.  I expected the trays to be cracked, losing their ability to even hold the DVDs and the trays to be only taped together with 1 to 3 pieces of tape.  That didn't bother me because I knew it would be that way from the other reviews and fully expected it.<br /><br />But upon viewing the discs I ran into problem after problem.  One of the discs had black spots embedded inside the surface itself, rendering the disc unreadable.  Most of the others were only readable in certain DVD players, not playable at all on my HTPC.  I have one of the seasons in the silver set and the quality difference is night and day.  On the silver set they used dual layer to fit 9+GB on each disc.  On the green set, the same number of episodes per disc but half the data, only 4.6 GB.  Of the discs that could read, many had blockiness associated with read errors on the disc thoughout some of the episodes, yet there were no scratches or noticeable marks on the disc itself.  The silver set has no problem playing in all of my players and no read errors on any of the discs.<br /><br />I can understand an occasional defective disc, but with this set the defects were the norm and the discs that worked were the exception.  There's just something wrong with this green set.<br /><br />The show itself is great, of course!  But I recommend against getting it in this form factor.<br /><br />Edit:  It looks as if the product I got from the amazon marketplace seller was very likely a pirated version.  Make sure you get from a reputable source if you decide to get it in this form factor.
B00337KMAA|1.0|I was ready to give this movie three stars for being mediocre but watchable.  Then came this horrible ending like those songs that just fade away.  Right away I dropped two stars and unfortunately, I had to give it the lowest Amazon rating.  Some writers commented on the chemistry between Clooney and Farmiga.  They do nothing most of the film and then she just walks away when he shows up at her door to find she has a husband and family.  You call that chemistry? I call it boring.  I did enjoy the part played by the young girl, although her acting was strictly minor league.  I suspect I will get slammed by other readers for this review.  That is fine.  I have to say what I really feel.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|it was a great buy for being a brand new product. and i like the way it came in only days to my door!
B002U33GUQ|5.0|Lacking the musical expertise and background of other reviewers, I can only concur with their spirit. I have most of the Mehldau releases and this ranks at the top. Disc no. 1 I would consider more \\"conventional\\" with lovely melodies and Mehldau's traditional imprint. \\"Walking the peak\\" - the last track on it - introduces us to the orchestral element which is dominant in the first parts of disc no. 2. In summary, although you will hear a wide range of arrangements, melodies and techniques, the overall result is an interesting, engaging and highly enjoyable work. This is what jazz is meant to be - providing that luxurious, laid-back yet highly intelligent musical tapestry that somehow gives more meaning to life.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I really wanted to give this album four stars instead of five, but I couldn't. It's Enya!! Her voice is so angelic and ethereal that I just can't; even though I only listen to the first three songs: Less Than A Pearl (intensely beautiful!!) Amarantine (I saw her perform this live. I cried.), and It's In The Rain (exhilarating. Especially when it's actually raining. Lol!). Another beautiful CD.... Thanks again, Enya.

B00009RDGA|5.0|This is a great film that has been given excellent treatment in the transfer and packaging. I've not watched the extras, but the feature is a wonderful story from the Depression. Beautiful black and white, silver-rich image. Hats off to the transfer work on this title. If you enjoyed \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" you'll like this film. The music is wonderful, but not in the bluegrass vein, for the most part. The settings are similar, however.
0385341008|2.0|Is there anyone else out there who thought this book, not only lacked literary substance, but was loosely formed, poorly crafted and too predictable?  I must be the only reader who had to force herself through it.  I do admit to finding the general drift mildly interesting although way too superficial.  I thought some of the characters were appealing as well, but for the most part the book struck me as half-baked-- somewhat amusing, awkward in presentation and basically unbelievable for a number of reasons.  I am surprised that the literary public has embraced what to me is a mediocre book.<br /><br />When I have wondered aloud why everyone is praising it, I am met with what strikes me as two very clich&eacute;d observations:  \\"I never heard about the Channel Islands before, so I learned some history.\\"  And, \\"The characters are so likable.\\"  While these are two reasons for the book's popularity, I would suggest there are many other epistolary novels that do this better.  \\"The Color Purple\\" comes to mind as does \\"84 Charring House Road,\\" from which \\"Guernsey\\" is derivative.  The first English novel ever written, \\"Pamela,\\" by Samuel Richardson was also an epistolary novel that held one's attention with a solid plot, compelling characters and intelligent observations of the times.<br /><br />Particularly striking to me was how awkwardly written \\"Guernsey\\" was.  Now, I know that if you're writing letters that are idiomatic and representative of a diverse group of people, the reader automatically assumes quaint usages and improper English are fine, but one has only to read Kathryn Stockett's \\"The Help\\" or again \\"The Color Purple,\\" to realize that insular language usage has its own appeal, if it is also at least minimally crafted.  \\"Guernsey\\" is full of sentences that not only are not quaint or particularly idiomatic, but are simply poorly written.  The authors use a plethora of prepositions in sentences, such as when the authoress Juliet is writing:  \\"With Amelia and Kit, I have walked to town several times for tea.\\"  This is a clumsy sentence, as are most in the book.  The very next sentence, again by the author-protagonist: \\"Cee Cee was right in his raptures over sailing into St. Peter Port.\\"  And, immediately following that one: \\"The harbor, with the town traipsing straight up and steeply to the sky, must be one of the most beautiful in the world.\\"  These sentences are syntactically awkward, laden with unnecessary prepositions, unwieldy, and full of dubious usages.  While we do not necessarily expect the letter writers from Guernsey to write eloquently or even melodiously, we do not expect the author/main character to misuse the English language or to render her thoughts in cumbersome prose.  We don't expect her to be prissy in her usage, but we don't appreciate her ignoring basic rules of good writing.  The language is not fresh; it is not creatively used.  I am reminded of hastily hacked emails, and that is too bad.  Such does not good literature make.  (See, I can do it, too!)<br /><br />Sometimes the voices of the letter writers are not consistent.  At first Eben Ramsey presents as a country bumpkin, and that is fine, but then he morphs into a somewhat articulate and observant correspondent.  Eben claims that his favorite book was \\"Selections from William Shakespeare\\" and that he particularly liked the sentence, \\"The bright day is done, and we are for the dark.\\"  He claims \\"If I could have thought the words \\"the bright day is done and we are for the dark, I'd have been consoled somehow [when the Germans came] and ready to go out and contend with circumstance--instead of my heart sinking to my shoes.\\"  That sentence did not make sense to me, and Eben does not explain why the quote strikes him so.  There are countless examples of this phenomenon in the book. The islanders enjoyed their books, but they cannot articulate why and thus are not convincing.<br /><br />In fact, among all the letters written by the Guernsey people, there is not one substantive justification for their reading the books beyond the claim that the society made them appreciate better books and thus they could no longer enjoy bad books and their reading the books explained their dubious social gatherings to the Germans.  One can tell the Guernsey people are not ignorant, but they do not reveal a single intelligent observation about the insight gained from the books they read.  A good example is Isola Pribbey, who writes how much she enjoyed \\"Wuthering Heights\\" because the Bronte sisters had such a miserable life.  She is the one who noted \\"Reading good books ruins you for enjoying bad books.\\"  Then she rushes on to explain: \\"I didn't like Wuthering Heights at first, but the minute that specter, Cathy, scrabbled her bony fingers on the window glass--I was grasped by the throat and not let go.\\"  Since that is the pivotal moment in the book and the most obvious memory one would have of it, I can't see that the woman got much out of the book except its most graphic scene.  She does not cite any other memory of the book.  Isola notes that she finds men in literature more interesting than real men and that she makes elixirs for men who have trouble getting it up.  Thus, it is all the more revealing that she doesn't have anything particularly amusing or insightful to say about Heathcliff, one of the most fascinating male characters in all of literature.  Since the Guernsey readers experienced such important writers as Seneca, Aurelius, Catullus, Shakespeare, Wordsworth, the Bronte sisters, Lamb, etc., one would expect them to have SOME insight into the books rather than trite, vague, one-sentence observations.  That is like reducing Plato to one sentence; it calls into question the credibility of all the Guernsey readers.<br /><br />The various letters are often short, like twitters or short emails, rather than what one would have expected of a letter in those days, when people had to wait for the snail mail to be delivered.  The Guernsey letters are often cryptic, sometimes funny, but to me they were ponderous and predictable except for cute asides that were rarely developed enough to sustain my interest.  Moreover, I did have difficulty differentiating the characters.  They tended to run together and to me they were somewhat generic.<br /><br />I found the plot predictable as well.  Particularly predictable were Juliet's romances.  Her American millionaire, Markham Reynolds, is reduced to the British stereotype of the successful American male: controlling, interested in a beautiful woman for the possibility of her being a trophy wife and grossly narcissistic, thinking his wishes and his amusement far outweigh other more serious concerns of caring people, such as the devastation of much of Europe.  Juliet naively observes that it is as if American males were unaffected by the war, as if they scarcely noticed the destruction and the death.  As a daughter of a veteran who died in the War and the stepdaughter of a traumatized Vet who never discussed it because the subject was too painful, I found that observation offensive.  Someone writing such a book should have consulted the statistics of American war dead and maimed before they made such an obtuse statement.  Similarly, Juliet's falling for the true-blue Dawsey was obviously part of the grand scheme from the beginning and came as no surprise.  Her adoption of the child likewise appeared as gratuitous as Juliet's apparent feminism in light of her own history and the fact that she's searching for a man from the novel's inception at a time when women were generally conforming.  In short, the plot was contrived and hokey, as was the protagonist's characterization.<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of the book is the characterization of the missing Elizabeth McKenna, who was sent off to the camps and we find out later, was executed, having demonstrated her compassion and wise understanding of people to the very end.  I admit I likedthat element of the book, although I cannot say I have a well drawn picture of her in my mind.  I'd rather read about Catherine Earnshaw, for sure.  Better yet, Heathcliff.<br /><br />Finally, I would suggest the book is a mishmash of things: simplistic literary criticism, awkward letters, disparate voices -- some of them interesting, some dull, a scrim of history, some important facts about the Occupation, its results and the horror of the Nazis in general, a sense of the Channel Islands and their timeless beauty and geography, and last but not least, the implication that hackneyed romanticism is alive and well.  Since this is a favorite among book clubs, I would suggest we all reconsider why we read literature.  I suspect some of us are falling for the idea that we should get some history out of our reading, no matter how shallow that history is, and that books should be easy to read and light in subject rather than deep enough to enrich our sense of what people are and what the nature of the world is.  Perhaps I'm old fashioned to want to see in literature a depiction of the complexity of people, of issues, of politics and love.  Hey, why not delve into what has some substance rather than \\"feel good\\" reads that we justify by explaining there's SOME history to it or LOVABLE characters, or it makes us \\"feel good\\"?

That became a huge hit when it was released advertising Friends and during 9-11. What is so interesting about this song with me is that I LOVED it until it became very popular. Weird isn't it? Anyhow, get this CD (or mp3 format) if you are able. This is another winner from Enya!

0385341008|5.0|The Society was born of necessity (to avoid punishment from the Nazi occupiers) but the members became true friends. After the war, one of the members, who is in possession of a book previously owned by writer,Juliet Ashton, initiates a correspondence with her. This starts a chain of events which allows the retelling of the islanders' experiences during the war and how they are coping with its aftermath.<br /><br />This is the most enjoyable book I've read in a long time. I like the epistolary structure as I feel I get to know each of the letter writers better than I would otherwise. And I truly liked getting to know them.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|I've never been a devotee of Holmes/Watson so Guy Ritchie's whirlwind take is quite entertaining.  Robert Downey Jr. is great as the vibrant and physical detective and Jude Law makes a good counterpoint as Watson.  The entire cast is very good and the depiction of 19th century London effective.  Despite the complex plot, everything comes together and the Moriarty connection leaves the sequel door open.  I liked Hans Zimmer's score too.  Overall very enjoyable.

0060751967|5.0|This was the first book in a series. I had read it before, but it had been awhile, so I wanted to start from the beginning. I am now in the second book.
0553582038|3.0|Unlike most of you, I didn't have to wait five years for the fourth volume, since I only heard about the series recently. That said, this volume was a real disappointment. The brilliant craftsmanship of the first three, which kept me reading even when the going got grim, is not in evidence here. Minor characters wander around the landscape, accomplishing nothing. The language is repetitive (he must have used \\"half a hundred\\", meaning a lot, at least that many times) and more words are expended describing what people are wearing, eating or displaying on their banners than describing action. I read the first three volumes, knowing full well from reviews that the series was going nowhere, simply for the joy of reading well crafted prose. That joy ended with volume four.    Some of the more interesting characters (Brienne, Jaime, Cercei and poor Anya) were simply left hanging (no pun intended in the case of one of them) at the end. Since the fifth volume (promised at the end of vol. four to appear in 2006; ha, ha!) apparently won't deal with these characters, I'll have to wait another 5+ years to find out what happened to them. By which time, I won't remember, or care.    Do you remember David Gerrold (War with the Chtorr, or whatever it was called)? This series will suffer the same fate. It started brilliantly, galloped on lamely for a while and will never be finished. I'm not going to speculate on the motives of either author, as many have done. I know my own motive, and that is not to waste any more money. I suggest you don't either.
0446569895|5.0|This is one of the best biographies I have read. It was almost as good as \\"The Dirt\\" for the first half of the book. Up to that point, I could not put it down. I have one big complaint about the book and that is that after it reached the point where Randy Rhodes passed away, the book mainly focused on Ozzy's life outside of the music as far as his band and recording of albums.<br /><br />I would have loved to see the book have another 10-20 pages in order to include how he found Jake E. Lee, why Jake left, how he found Zakk, and some info on the writing and recording of \\"Bark At The Moon\\", \\"The Ultimate Sin\\", \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\" and albums that followed as well as some information about putting together the \\"Tribute\\" album.<br /><br />It's amazing that Ozzy is still alive with all the drugs and alcohol he has consumed in his life. At times he was taking in excess of 25 different pills and drinking several pints of alcohol a day. It's amazing any of those combination's didn't kill him.<br /><br />You'll see sides of Ozzy you may never have known existed. He holds nothing back, giving details most would be afraid to tell even their closest friends. I've always liked Ozzy and after reading about his life directly from him, I have to say I have the utmost respect for him now. He may be a giant in the rock and roll word of music, but he's even bigger as a person.<br /><br />If you're an Ozzy fan or just a music fan in general, I highly recommend this book. Over all it's an excellent read and takes you on a great journey of a poor kid from Aston to rocks Prince of Darkness.
0345452577|1.0|Mr. Kellerman wants the reader to believe that psychologists play a major role as medical providers. In his book, Dr. Carrier, a psychologist goes on medical rounds<br />with physicians, is a consultant on the tumor board, is paged by the hospital for emergencies, is in a romance with a physician, and is seemingly requested by every surgeon for preop consults.  Poppycock!! These roles describe physicians. A psychologist is not a medical provider. Most psychology degrees are liberal arts degrees not science. I believe Mr. Kellerman has delusions of grandeur regarding the field of psychology. His patientz deserve medical care-not someone to hold their hand and tell them they'll get better.<br /><br />  There are many glaring medical errors in this book. The physician Angela recalls how she almost killed someone.  She says that she almost injected a dose of insulin that was off by 100 units.  It is common knowledge  an insulin syringe holds up to 100 units. How could the dose be off by 100? What? She was supposed to give 30 units? And, almost gave 300 in a syringe that only holds up to 100 units.  This explains why psychologists shouldn't write medical thrillers-they have have little to no medical knowledge.  And,btw physicians rarely draw up or administer shots of insulin most patients are trained to do it themselves.  There are other numerous errors. He should get somebody with a medical background to proof-read.<br /><br />  He is just so annoying and irritating.  I read and finish everything so I groaned when I realized I had picked up another one of his stupid books about the importance of psychologists in medicsl care. I hope if a medical crisis ever happens he has enough sense to csll a physician!

B000089770|5.0|There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all   occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special   effects, others the story.     In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are   keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the   movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a   glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a   small 7-11 style store in a major city.     William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,   and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the   tough-guy with a big heart role.     The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,   such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION   but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that   will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those   over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of   human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles   that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.   The key here, is showing people their human sides, and   willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in   peace with one another, responsibly.     Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed   with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in   each moment, are not the norm, considering the \\"fantasy\\"   or \\"unreal\\" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target   the below 17 age bracket.     Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to   enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting   talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.     As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my   favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in   this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not   unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd   that we used to see, in other movies of the same period,   such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,   or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances   with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a   different phase of her life than before, but in   SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your   attention.     In terms of the DVD edition, the colors, sharpness of the   picture and audio, is top-notch.

B000QQTP36|4.0|7 out of 10      Sibylle Baier didn't make this music to be heard by the general public, her son released it more than 30 years after it was recorded).  She made this music for herself and those close to her. Her style of music is very personal folk; sparse musically and rich emotionally.  Every song but the last is just Baier and her guitar, making music that reaches down into her soul.  The stories that she tells always make the song worth listening to; \\"William must have a chorus in his heart and lilacs in his shoes/ William is the sweetest boy I ever saw.\\"- \\"William\\"     All of the songs are very short; the entire album of 14 songs is only 33 minutes long.  Despite their brevity, the tracks pack powerful punches.  Here are the lyrics for \\"Remember the Day\\"-  \\"I no longer thought of what is good or what is not / there simply was the water's smell and remoteness/ I only stood and watched that old cold ocean / in tender and bright, full, unspeakable emotion.\\"  The songs are not terribly different stylistically, but each one has its own tenderness.      My girlfriend introduced me to Sybille Baier with the song, \\"I Lost Something in the Hills\\" because of the similarities to Nick Drake.  \\"Colour Green\\" certainly does remind me of the moving \\"Pink Moon.\\"  However, this album is not \\"Pink Moon\\".  Sibylle Baier is a commendable song writer, but does not have the versatility of Nick Drake.  After a few songs, you know exactly what you can expect from the entire album.  I don't mind that too much, but it can be tiring to listen to \\"Colour Green\\" all at once.  Overall, I am very happy that my girlfriend introduced me to Sibylle Baier and her potent music.

1594488878|4.0|This might not be the book I'd suggest to someone who wants an introduction to Hornby's novels.  On the surface, this may seem like another story about not having acted on one's passions while still young enough to recover from the ensuing follies. Hornby's gift is not in the portrayal of regret and resignation, but in the way his fully-formed characters take some responsibility for their plight.  They still might not take action, but at least they've shown some self-awareness. The irony of it all is that the Internet, without which this story would not have been possible, gives us a chance to reconnect, to make good on missed personal opportunities.  Hornby's characters will still find a way to screw it up.  Hornby's introspection as seen through characters in all his books could be annoyingly \\"talky\\" in less skilled hands.  But there's always a healthy dose of humility in them, and that makes our eavesdropping on their inner dialogues a more poignant experience.  The three main characters--an academic, and website runner,  obsessed with a musician who may have attained legendary status more through his disappearance than through his body of work, his longtime girlfriend who toils away in a local, barely-noticed museum, and the musician in question, who drives them apart in swift unaware fashion, all are pathetic sorts.  But they also arouse sympathy.  Hornby's humor sneaks up on you at unpredictable moments, and though he seems to resort, on occasion, to jokes you see coming, his characters' navel-gazing is easily relatable.  The book succeeds in pushing across the idea that no one simply disappears, and certainly not from ourselves.  Hornby's love of music, and the relative merits of American and British culture, appears in all his books, but there's a maturity in this one that never lets these topics ovewhelm the characters.  Not his best effort, but not disappointing in the least.
B000005RRF|5.0|I've owned Misplaced Childhood on cassette tape since its release. I finally wore it out too much and had to purchase the CD, so now I can listen to it in my car as well. I absolutely love Marillion, I have been a fan of theirs ever since the release of Script for a jester's tear and I was lucky to see them in concert when they were on tour promoting their album Misplaced Childhood. I saw Marillion and singer Fish part ways with great sadness and I can honestly say that I don't like the post-Fish Marillion. I guess it's like that with a lot of bands that change singers, you either like the new one or you don't. But I'll always have my old Marillion tunes to listen to with fond memories of the 80s.

I would have been musically better off ordering the DVD instead of the MP3.  The sound quality is horrible.  It sounds muffled and tinny, like it was recorded in a box.  It's pretty bad when the sound quality of the original vinyl, scratches and all is preferable to the sound of a digital recording.

0765350386|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am a huge fan of both Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind. However, this book is completely different than either of those two authors, so if you didn't like them feel free to read the book.    Plot (no spoilers):    The series starts off with memorable characters, a fresh, imaginative plot, and even though there is the classic good v. evil dichotomy this book takes fantasy to a whole new level.    Pros:    --Character development (unlike others I found it spot-on: the author doesn't need to detail everything about a character, I like to imagine a bit myself)  --AMAZING system of magical powers  --Plot turns  --Unique world    Cons:  --The first couple of pages can and may confuse you, as the series is set in a completely unique world. Read on and you will be rewarded.    All in all: Read this book! You won't be able to put it down!
0764207407|5.0|I've always loved Jane Austen's books...I love the rich culture, refined manners and etiquette, the polite romances, and the author's subtle and witty sense of humor. Her books make me laugh, sometimes make me cry, but always leave me with a smile.<br /><br />Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood; two girls raised well, but reduced to poverty at the death of their father. They each have met the man they want to marry, and are both convinced that the young men feel the same. Everything seems to be going along smoothly...or does it? Both of their romances collapse, and they are left to deal with them sensibly. However, both stories end surprisingly, giving each girl her happy, although not necessarily expected, ending.<br /><br />The copy of Sense and Sensibility I read was the Insight Edition by Bethany House Publishers...in addition to the original classic story, they have added footnotes throughout the book, explaining details about the culture and history, the films based on the book, Jane Austen herself, etc. I found them to make the book even more interesting, even though I already enjoyed the story for itself. Also, in the back of the book, they have added several \\"questions for conversations,\\" which seem like they would especially help younger readers analyze the story better.<br /><br />If you're looking for a classic romance, this would be a good read for a lazy summer afternoon.<br /><br />(Bethany House Publishers provided me with a copy of Sense and Sensibility - Insight Edition in exchange for this review)

B001FB4W16|5.0|Picture quality is better than broadcast. I'm late to the party here, but I came, and I like. Wanted to kick in another 5 Stars. Three stars for the vampire romance--but two bonus stars for all the female nudity. I don't have cable. I don't have HBO. Wife and I watch all our TV in HD on Blu-ray. After watching Rome, and now this, we're becoming a huge fan of HBO. Sex, violence, profanity. Only HBO seems to have to sack to display the truth of the human condition. I watch little TV because it's censored down to lameness, and I refuse to eat commercials. My wife mostly reads erotic literature. Maybe I'm getting old, but I'm tired of America's PG-13 centered entertainment culture, so I've decided to hand out Gold Stars to entertainment products that raise the bar. True Blood is the nipples! The only thing it needs is some lesbian vampire romance...
B001CDLATE|5.0|If you are looking for a Blu-Ray disk to show off your HD video set-up, look no further.  I own over 30 Blu-rays now and have rented almost 70 more over the past 2 1/2 years.  Only a few (The Golden Compass, The Fifth Element and Casino Royale) come anywhere near the video quality of this disk (if I could quantify, I'd say perhaps 80%).   Watch the 'making of' featurette and you'll see why.  Every frame was scanned at 4k resolution (around 32 megapixels each) and cleaned up over the course of several months.  The result is a picture that is truly remarkable.  The audio quality is fantastic but pales a tad in comparrison to the stunning picture.  Although the content itself can be a (oh i don't know...'non-life reaffirming', such as the monotinous factory work scenes) I would highly reccommend this documentary.  There are a few very 'interesting' religious rituals that I had never knew existed (and probably most people didn't until this was made) that were fascinating to watch.  I pop this in on rainy days and just let the eye-candy effect take over.
B001QOGYBI|2.0|I'm sorry, I thought this was awful.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't think it was great.<br /><br />The stop motion looked bad, although I couldn't tell if that was the intention of the animators or not.  Even though I had read the book, I just couldn't find interest in the plotline.  I had to constantly turn up the television volume because the voices were so low and quiet.<br /><br />I couldn't stand the animal characters and was cheering for the farmers about halfway through it.  This movie was not a delight, and a bit disturbing.

And to also think that she hooked up with a total stranger of the opposite sex on those streets is also scary. Such a hard knocks beginning. So poor.

B00004RF83|4.0|I found this movie in looking at films similar to some of my favorites such as [[ASIN:B00004XPPE Fail-safe (Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00004SGB5 On the Beach]], movies I loved watching with my Dad growing up. If you like films along those lines, you will like this one.<br /><br />First, review of the content: This is a chilling tale of one variation on a way we could have found to destroy ourselves during the cold war. I won't say any more, no spoilers here. The acting is top notch. Both Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster play their roles with just the right amount of emotion. As my fellow reviewer noted in a review also strangely enough written today, a number of familiar character actors have great roles as well. I particularly like Martin Balsam. The \\"futuristic\\" set design is a bit dated but intriguing and quaint. The direction is interesting especially after listening to the director's commentary track. I rarely watch commentary tracks all the way through but I did for this one. It was interesting hearing about his preferred setups and back-stage secrets. Who would have guessed that the long-appearing hall at the pentagon was a forced-perspective set and that they hired little people (he uses another term) to walk at the far end. I know I am reviewing this on April Fools Day but I kid you not. I felt the direction seemed more television-like than for most movies but that also imparted a bit more tension to it in some ways. Rod Serling's script is sensational and there are a number of classic Serling monologues.<br /><br />Second, review of the presentation: This is why I'm giving this one \\"just\\" 4 stars. The print this is made from can't possibly be the best they could find, but even if it is they should have at least taken the time to clean it before putting in through. This transfer has quite a bit of dirt and hair visible along with less easily correctable issues like occasional film tears and scattered spots where the picture warps for a second, likely from this print getting heated in a stuck projector and not quite burning. Despite these quibbles this is a very watchable film and is well worth buying or renting. I doubt that a better DVD will be produced in the future given the relatively limited appeal of this type of picture - one has to actually watch closely and think about it to enjoy it.m this print getting heated in a stuck projector and not quite burning.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|My mother has always been a big end of the world movie fan (she loved Armageddon, Deep Impact, Day After Tomorrow, ID4, etc), so when this came out, she asked that I get it for her. What a mistake!<br /><br />I knew from the second I walked in on the movie, around a half hour in, that it was utter garbage. Not one of the main characters dared to rise above the cardboard stereotype that they initially appeared to be. Misunderstood father. Ex-wife who still loves him but is pretending she doesn't for some reason. Bratty kid #1. Bratty kid #2. Ex-wife's new boyfriend. Meek genius guy no one listens to, who finally dares to stand up to the wrongheaded establishment. Wacky crazy guy with long hair that knew it all the time. Self-sacrificing President who gives stirring speech on TV. Noble Russian guy. Etc, etc, etc. You've seen these characters done many times before, and everything they do plays out exactly like you'd expect. The characters you expect to die, die. The characters you expect to live and become romantically connected, yep. They do just that. UGH!<br /><br />As for the special effects... meh. Just meh. It's like watching someone else play a video game. They're dodging falling buildings in a plane, and jumping over huge cracks in the earth, and I just kept thinking, hand me the controller, I want to try that. And then, I was thinking, how do I skip this boring cutscene?<br /><br />The problem with 2012 is that it tries to pretend to be something it's clearly not: a character-driven, thought provoking film. The movie would have worked just as well if they would have removed all the dialogue and just had 2 hours of the world being destroyed. In fact, I think it would have worked better, because unlike the actors, I think the audience could muster some awe at the events taking place if we didn't have to listen to inane banter between Jon Cusack and Amanda Peet after they literally just escaped certain death for the fifth time in an hour.<br /><br />There's nothing to recommend this movie. It can't be taken seriously, but it's not funny enough to even warrant a chuckle. Just stay away. If you end up with a copy, use it to prop up a table leg or something.t can't be taken seriously, but it's not funny enough to even warrant a chuckle. Just stay away.

B0035V35P8|3.0|\\"Ninja Assassin\\" opens with a very bloody action sequence, in which a gang of Japanese yakuza mobsters are murdered by a deadly ninja. The assassin's attack is much faster than Uma Thurman's heroine in \\"Kill Bill Vol.1.\\" The killer (or killers) is silent and almost invisible and the gangsters have no chance from the beginning. The scene ends with severed heads and limbs in a pool of blood. We don't know why they should be killed, but we do know we are in for an extremely gory action flick.    But we have to wait for that action to happen. The over-the-top violence is followed by the not-so-impressive storyline, in which Europol agent Mika Coretti (Naomie Harris) investigates a series of assassinations that she suspects are related to a mysterious clan of ninjas. In the meanwhile, we are introduced to a man named Raizo (Rain), who lives alone in an apartment room almost bare of furniture.    \\"Ninja Assassin\\" is a modern-day version of Grade-B ninja action movies, with special effects and martial arts stunts. Ozunu, a very strict leader of the clan, is played by Shô Kosugi, star of the cult ninja films during the 1980s. Hero's name Raizo reminds us of Ichikawa Raizo, Japanese actor best known for his role of the swordsman Nemuri Kyoshiro. The film is helmed by James McTeigue, director of \\"V for Vendetta.\\"     The intention of the producers (including Joel Silver, Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski) is clear - a cool and edgy ninja action film updated for the new generation. Sadly they forgot one thing: action. The stunts themselves are decent, but set-pieces are marred by choppy editing. The narrative is uneven and awkward with too many flashbacks. Actors did a fine job, but James McTeigue is not ready for this kind of big action flick, relying too much on CGI-created blood and weapons.    Though it is one of the critically bashed films released in 2009, \\"Ninja Assassin\\" is not as bad as you might be led to believe. The idea of modern ninja action film is not bad. Itonly needs a better director.
076532413X|2.0|(spoilers)        I got this book because of the TV series, which I think is really good, so far anyway.  I found the novel to be not bad, to start off with at least, but nothing special.  Sometimes, as in the case of \\"The Graduate\\", or \\"Three (Six) Days of the Condor\\",  the movie or TV show is much better than the original novel, and this is one of those cases.    Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought it was reasonably well written.  However, the TV series starts off with the worldwide disaster caused by the first blackout or flashforward.  We get to be mystified, not knowing what happened until well into the first season.  In the book, we start off with the supercollider experiment at CERN, and there's never much mystery about whether that had something to do with it.  Also, in the series the time between the blackout and the flashforward is a few months, whereas in the book it's over 20 years.  The series already has elements in it that are completely foreign to the book, which is absolutely fine with me, and I'm certain they don't intend to use the rather bizarre, anticlimatic, ridiculous ending of the book, so it's something quite different; it just takes off from the basic idea of the book, but in very different directions.  I've noticed that \\"Lost\\" just no longer holds my attention the way it used to, and I don't care that much about how it ends, though I do still follow it.  This series gives me some of the same excitement and mystery that \\"Lost\\" did for at least the first three years.  I don't think this series is going to be that good, but it's pretty good.      The series is very different from the book, so far, and I hope it continues to diverge.  It's a Hollywood  show, OK, so it's set mostly in Los Angeles, and the main characters are mostly Americans, but at the same time it's presented as something global, whereas the book is pretty much focussed on CERN.  The book has a lot of gobbledygook speculation about predestination/free will, and whatI think is a ridiculous, anticlimatic ending.  The characters aren't developed at all; in the series, the characters (pretty much a different set of them) are reasonably well developed, and having them played by actors helps a lot.  The acting and direction in the series are pretty good too, and there's a lot of action and suspense that make it pretty entertaining.    You can read the book in a couple-three hours, and for me it left a sense of dissatisfaction.  It started off OK and kind of trailed off.  I didn't really care about the characters, and by the end I didn't really care what happened.  And as I said, the ending is ridiculous.    So, if like me, you're interested in the book because of the series, I'd say don't bother.  Just follow the series.

B002XMGGJM|3.0|I actually got Law Abiding Citizen by accident from Netflix. I was supposed to get [[ASIN:B001OQCV2O 2012]], but oddly it was Law Abiding Citizen in the 2012 case. They sent me out 2012 when I reported the issue and I watched that first. Oy, what a mistake that was, because 2012 wasn't a Disaster Movie it was a movie disaster! Anyway...<br /><br />Law Abiding Citizen was a lot better than 2012. In fact as the movie played out, I thought to myself, \\"what a great movie.\\" Even as the credits rolled I felt thoroughly entertained by the movie I had just watched. It had a lot of action, suspense, and it kept me guessing right up to the very end.<br /><br />Then as I reflected on the film I thought more about how silly the premise of the movie is and how far-fetched what the antihero (Gerard Butler) pulls off really is. I'd love to go into detail, but I'm struggling to do so without giving away the critical twists and turns of the movie.<br /><br />So let me just say this: with Law Abiding Citizen you get a pretty decent thriller about a guy (Butler) that you don't want to mess with who a couple home-invaders do indeed mess with. The bad guys get caught and Butler allows the DA (Jamie Foxx) to exact this great country's due process on the bad guys...which fails. So Butler sets a plan to take out the bad guys himself and anyone else that was involved in the failure of Due Process of Law.<br /><br />But man, the way this guy chooses to make his point, and the way he ultimately carries it out are where you'll be saying, \\"Hold on a second there.\\" So check your brain at the door as I did, sit back and enjoy. It's like the small rollercoaster in the amusement park...it's fun while you're riding it, but after you get off you realize it wasn't that great.
0553582038|2.0|Perhaps it was inevitable (but certainly not necessary) that Martin would hit a creative wall. Following the rather spectacular third installment, Feast for Crows is an example of a writer treading water, producing mounds of details that really go nowhere. Sure, for the detail obsessed, knowing the biblical equivilants of what king \\"beget\\" whom (and correspondingly, who chopped off whose head) will be enormously satisfying - I am sure those are the same ones who feel a need (no, responsibility) to learn Klingon before they can truly understand Star Trek... Or maybe, they can be that much more \\"correct\\" at the next Renaissance fair).   The sense of inertia in this latest installment is Martin fairly screaming his need for a strong handed agent or editor. Stop dithering and get on with it Man!
B0036XN2L2|2.0|I am a huge Scorpions fan and it pains me to write a poor review of their last CD.  The music and vocal quality are pretty good but what I can not get past is the lyrics.  It is like the songs were written in German and the English translation was poorly done.  Still, if you are a Scorpions fan I would go ahead a grab it.  If you are still new to the Scorpions, I would grab just about any of their earlier records.    Thanks to the Scorpions for the great music.    Follow Up Below:    I went back and listened to the Scorps previous 4 CD's and it just reinforced my review above.  This album is just not up to their own high standards.  For relatively new Scorpions fans, grab [[ASIN:B000TSIK14 Humanity Hour 1]] for a great example of what the band was capable of late in their career.

B002U33GUQ|5.0|Wow.  I've been listening to Brad Mehldau for a very long time, and I treasure all of his albums.  When Largo came out, I really got hooked.  When he replaced Jorge Rossy with Jeff Ballard on drums, his trio took off to whole new levels (see Day is Done and Live album).<br /><br />I got Highway Rider last week and haven't stopped listening to it.  I've probably listened to it from start to finish every day.  It is probably the first album where I don't want to skip to a certain track, rather I want to listen to every track before it (and then every track after).  Each track has its own specific place in the album. That's not to say that tracks shouldn't be listened to at random...  Hearing Joshua Redman solo over Brad's orchestral compositions is something that has to be heard by any jazz or new music fan.  Redman and Mehldau playing off each other is just one of the treats you're in for with this album (see The Falcon Will Fly Again for one of many fine examples).  While the orchestral compositions are phenomenal, the way that Mehldau arranges the \\"jazz\\" instruments is just as impressive.  Everything seems to fade in and out at the perfect time.<br /><br />I don't want to over-analyze anything here because I'm sure it wouldn't do the album justice.  Let's just say that I think this is the best jazz album I've heard in many, many years.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|Movie companies must love and hate me. They love me because I have bought many Blu Ray disc. They hate me because I buy them on my own terms. This means waiting for the version and price I want. When \\"Ronin\\" came out at Best Buy it was $34.95 for months and months, and it was a bare-bones edition. I saw it the other day at BB for nine and change and bought it then.     The first Blu Ray edition of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy is soon to come out. But I won't buy it because I want the longer director's cut. So I have to wait. Big deal. It's not like there's a shortage of other movies for me to watch.     Now here comes the first iteration of the blockbuster Avatar. I won't be buying this Blu Ray release either. Because:   1. It's a bare bones edition.  2. 20th Century Fox has already announced a better \\"Ultimate\\" edition coming out in November.   3. Fox has announced a 3D version coming out sometime in 2011.     What? Am I supposed to buy all three versions: the movie I must have now; the movie with extras; and the 3d version? These companies get away with greed because consumers let them.     Not this consumer. They can hate me now. They can love me when I buy the edition I want at the price I want. In the meantime, I will not be bored.     We should all vote with the power of our wallets and teach these jokers a lesson.     Go to this LA Times article  [...]    Here's an excerpt.    If you want all the extra features, you'll have to wait until November, when you can buy a second \\"Avatar\\" DVD, currently titled the \\"Ultimate Edition,\\" which will include all of the fancy stuff. And then, if you have really deep pockets, you can come back to the video store next year and buy a third, 3-D, version of the DVD. This naked attempt to get consumers to buy the same disc twice (or thrice) has been common practice for years in the music business, where new \\"specially remastered editions\\" of the same old CD, sometimes weighted down with a few extra \\"never before released\\" tracks, have earned record companies the lasting enmity of music fans everywhere, who after being exploited over and over by record companies turned to illegal downloading with barely a twinge of guilt.

0099511177|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.<br /><br />And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.<br /><br />Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.<br /><br />Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering.

B00275EGX8|3.0|In addition to NOT being the \\"best movie of the year\\", it's also not the \\"best war movie ever\\", as a critic stated.<br /><br />It's probably the best Iraq movie so far, but that's not really saying a lot, since most of them have been nothing but thinly-veiled anti-war, anti-Bush, anti-American propaganda.  If you want to see a superior Middle East war/conflict movie, check out The Kingdom.<br /><br />Watching The Hurt Locker, it is way too easy to sense all the overly-exaggerated parts.  They come about often.<br /><br />There are some parts where you feel like they are telling little snippets of stories told to the filmmakers by real soldiers, such as the strange \\"fight\\" in which two characters take turns punching each other in the gut, like a game.  But the way those snippets are thrown in there seem random and out of character for the lead characters.<br /><br />I did like the way the movie took its time in certain parts, in order to build up some tension.  But I have no idea how the director won \\"Best Director\\", because a truly great director would have the audience cringing and squirming.  The result in this movie was mild tension, followed by more unbelievable actions on the soldiers' part.  You tell me, what soldier would sneak out after dark, running around alone without a weapon in some Iraq town?  It's loopy, and even the people he stumbles across are totally unrealistic.<br /><br />Actually, I do know why this director won for \\"Best Director\\" and the movie won for \\"Best Movie\\".  Because Hollywood is so out of touch.  Seeing as the actors make up most of the Academy voting population, it makes sense (absurdly) that this movie would win.

Higly recommended!
B00004RF83|5.0|This movie is based on the eponomous novel by Fletcher Knebel and Charles W Bailey which is a terrifc read too (maybe better than the movie).  With the screen play written by Rod Serling it has just the right amount of suspense though it does not follow the novel exactly.  A Marine colonel, played by Kirk Douglas, accidentally happens upon a plot to overthrow the US government by the top military leadership (lead by Burt Lancaster) who are upset with the President (played by Frederick March) because he plans to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union that will eliminate both countries nuclear weapons arsenals.  Full plot details can be read on Wikipedia.      A super cast with Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Frederick March and Ava Gardner leading the way and each adding just the right amount of character and emotion to their roles.  For movie buffs (or older telvison watchers), long time character actors like Andrew Duggan, Martin Balsam, Edmond O'Brien and Richard Anderson all make appearances.  The film is in black and white which I think added a bit to the tension even though it was made in 1964 when color was available.      If you are looking for a great drama with fine actors and a good story line I don't think you can go wrong with this movie. I won't spoil the ending, but recommend you purchase the movie and add it to your collection or rent it some weekend.  I have it in my collection and have enjoyed watching it and sharing it with friends. I hope that you will too.
0811729117|4.0|It's rare you get a Tank Commanders view of WW2. Very interesting reading from a technical stand point - you get to see what a huge impact Tiger tanks had in combat. They rarely had a chance to fight in more than groups of two or three, yet could on occasion, stop many more than their numbers.<br /><br />If you're looking for any kind of apologies from this German author, forget it. Carius is only ashamed at how the German WW2 vets have been treated in the since the end of WW2. A highly decorated and wounded warrior glosses over or does not mention any of the evils of the Nazis, but insists that they were all only soldiers doing their duty. That perspective does get tiresome, which is one of the books drawbacks.<br /><br />There should have been a few more maps of the areas mentioned and campagins. There are enough photos to help the reader see the equipment and terrain being described. The describtion of battles, what a tanker has to due before during and after combat really make this book enjoyable. It was also interesting to hear of his meeting with one of the most evil of all Nazis Heinrich Himmler. The Appendix has orginal and translated copies of his awards, orders amd newspaper clippings.<br /><br />Definately recommended for Armor Buffs and those who like to learn about history as it was made in the trenches. Insightful for how armor tactics & battle really have not changed much since WW2. The book has wrinkles and flaws, but that too, makes it different.
0307346609|2.0|I've been hesitant to write a review of this book. It would appear that many people outright hate it while others think it is the greatest zombie book ever. It would also appear there are strong feelings toward opposite opinions. I will endeavor to give my honest review regardless..<br />I thought it was... disappointing.<br />As many people on here have pointed out, it is very left leaning politically. This didn't really bother me as I've liked many a book that leaned one way or another. That's not what I care about in fiction and I tend to just tune that sort of thing out.<br />I'm not sure if this book would have much of a following or would have even been published if MB was not Mel's kid as the writing is amateurish at best. It would appear MB did very little research or preparation before writing this book as it has many glaring errors in the facts department.<br />My main problem with this book is it lacks structure and cohesion that is required to tell a great tale. What we're left with here is a pile of notes on different people in a binder. Much of it appears to only make it into the book as padding.<br />His characters DO seem to speak with one voice and we are left with only a couple of good ideas in the book that an editor should have told MB to go back and develop. The blind monk story should have been more developed as should have the kid escaping the building even though both are a little clich&eacute;.  I can forgive the clich&eacute; as MB is new to the genre but most of the rest of the book was unmemorable and dull.<br />I'm afraid that since MB's first foray into fiction has been so well accepted by the masses that for so long have been programmed to have the short attention span of a fly, that he will fail to develop any great skill in writing. I'm not asking he develop a Tolkien level of detail in his writing. Just some level of detail would have been nice.<br />I understand there's been a lot of trouble developing this into a screenplay. I understand why. Can anyone who's read this book remember one character's name without looking one up? I can't honestly say I'd recommend this to anyone. Other opinions will vary.book remember one character's name without looking one up? I can't honestly say I'd recommend this to anyone. Other opinions will vary.

It arrived just on time.
B0001VV1GK|2.0|The Parking Garage by Plan Toys was a present for our older son from his grandmother and at first it seemed like it would be a hit; however, after the first ten minutes he just lost interest and returned to his Play-Doh sets, his trains, Hot Wheels, and Pixar Cars that he is so fond of. Since then he has pretty ignored it. After finding the same product offered on Amazon I was very surprised at the high price, which I would never have paid myself. The Parking Garage is very plain to see, and comes with a plain blue employee, and an even plainer green car (whose tires come off very easily). At least it feels good to the touch as it is all made out of good quality wood without any dangerous chemicals, which is definitely something, but that's pretty much it.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|My secret pleasure, watching the world get destroyed. '2012' has whacky characters, I love Yellowstone blowing up and the DJ broadcasting it live, a strong compassionate black president, oddly constructive so you're kept guessing as to what the govs are up to, some realism about 'who' would get picked to survive, and lots of visual images of crumbling various national landmarks. A fun movie for the disaster film fanatic.
B00005LK95|5.0|I liked the movie a lot when I saw it at the theater many years ago, I bought it because I told my 4 year old son that I saw a movie a long time ago where there was a robot like Walle, but a lot bigger like a person. He enjoyed it very much!!! and also has a message for kids.    About the price, I liked it, delivery time was just as they say they'd take if not a little early.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|I must agree with those that are saying we should wait for either the enhanced edition or 3D edition. This movie was phenomenal. This disk is bare bones basic. No extras, no commentary, no nothing. They just want to make us buy the same movie 2 or 3 times. Well, I'm not gonna do it! (And you shouldn't either  ;o)
B0000UJDLM|2.0|I loved the movie, I wanted to show it to my 4 year old son that loves walle. I didn't like that the features of the movie at the webpage informed that the movie came also in spanish spoken and subtitles, but it didn't.
0143038419|4.0|I have to agree with most of the reviews here.  Both those good and bad.  Elizabeth Gilbert comes off as quite selfish, a bit of a whiner, a little spoiled (who can take off a year+ to \\"find themselves/God\\"?), and despite the popularity of this book the telling of the story is hardly inspirational as a perfect work of literature.  The best thing about her storytelling is that she makes all three countries, Italy, India, and Indonesia, very accessible.  I want to live in Rome for four months (and I remember the things I liked about Rome so much when I did a short study abroad stint there), I want to study in an ashram in India-even though I've never had any major desire to do so beforehand, and meet wonderful characters in Bali, Indonesia.      Frankly, I thought India fell flatest.  Richard was good, but he was the only real character there and so there was just a little too much of internal thought of Ms. Gilbert.  I get it, that was the point, but to be bookended by Italy (with tons of fun new friends) and Bali (with new friends that were very rich in personality), India was disappointing.  Had it been at the end, I would have probably given the book fewer stars, but I liked Indonesia and Italy so much that the book was much better than it probably would have been.  Italy was alive in her writing, but maybe that was my own gluttony for good Italian food shining through.  It sounded the most fun out of all.  Bali was also considerably better than India, and her medicine man's way of meditation (\\"sit and smile\\") is enchanting and something that I think makes much more sense than most of the meditation in India.      The great part of Ms. Gilbert is that she makes friends easily, and that makes her travels all the more enriching to read.  I actually envy her that, because I take a much longer time to make friends in new places.      The one problem I have with actually calling her selfish, and meaning it negatively, is that I think being selfish is a perfectly valid.I think most people are completely selfish until they get married.  I think Elizabeth Gilbert just got her life a little backwards.  She was miserable, and didn't know herself and couldn't be by herself AT ALL (clearly, since I wanted to throttle her every time she whined about David or feeling guilty for leaving a marriage in which she was miserable, and cheered when she stopped obsessing), and frankly you need to be comfortable being by yourself before you should jump into marriage.    Should we all go off and find God on a year-long travel adventure to countries that start with the most egotistical pronoun?  Hardly (not that I wouldn't love to).  But I liked that her message, even if not explicitly said, is that she couldn't be happy in a relationship when she couldn't be happy by herself.  I think that's a good message for people to understand, and she tells it in a fun, not too metaphysical way.  If I ever have a huge amount of extra cash laying around, I'll take a page from Elizabeth Gilbert's \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\"
B0002U0UKS|5.0|Joe Hisaishi's score for \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" is such a delight ... and money well spent. The main theme, heard in variations throughout the score, is a waltz that simply embeds itself in your head and your heart ... a waltz that reminds one of \\"Carousel\\" or of a grand 19th century ball. I've listened to this music over and over and never grow tired of it. One caveat: the jacket comes in Japanese; but you can easily find the English translations for each piece on the Net.
B002K51LXI|1.0|Good God, how did this dry-as-dust camel flop become an international sensation?  There's an old maxim that an author should show, not tell, but all Larssen seems to do is pile on facts and descriptives to create empty shells of characters with no lifeblood in them.  When I discovered the author's Lefty pedigree I understood -- people's lives are predetermined by their their race, gender, and class. Unless brave middle-aged sensitive souls, much like the author, save them of course. Blecch!

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This is the funniest film I have seen in years. I have watched it several times now and always find myself laughing uncontrollably almost all the way through.  The characters are perfectly cast, it is situation comedy at its best.  I do not see how the new american version will come anywhere near being such a hoot.
0393061310|2.0|I picked up this book from a local library because I was interested in learning something new about how civilizations evolved. I saw the video on PBS and it had piqued my interest at first. The writing style was very repetitive and goes into great lenghts about esoteric details related to food production and domestication of plants and animals. I did learn about the evolution from hunter gatherer to farming based community, and what unexpected impacts it had. I'm not so well versed as other reviewers to be able to object to anything in the book on ideological or moral grounds.    I just couldn't continue reading the book because it was very long winded. I read it half way through, and, chapter after chapter, it kept talking about food production and domestication of crops and animals ad nauseum. I asked myself why am I being innundated with so much detail about a subject that could be covered as a preface to the real subject of the book, which was, human conquests and evolution of human civilization.    It does start off as an interesting read. It covers the conquests of the Maori people over the Maoriri tribe in the Catham Islands, and then it goes on to talk about how the Spanish conquistadors won out over the native american Incas and others. It was intersting to learn that hunter gatherers were generally more peaceful (in terms of waging wars) than the food producers.    Some questions are posed early on in the book and are never addressed until several chapters later, which kind of bothered me. An example of this is the question: \\"what was the reason for the failure of food production to appear, until modern times, in some ecologically very suitable areas that are among the world's richest centers of agriculture and herding today\\". In short, why did food production not appear until modern times in some of the richest places for agriculture, like California? This question was posed in the beginning of chapter 5 on p. 93. Several chapters later in the middle ofchapter 8, is the question finally addressed. It talks about the various geographic and botanical factors why the fertile crescent was the first place where food production was developed, and why the abscence of these factors caused agriculture to catch on later in other places. All the while the user is left with this nagging un-answered question.    Maybe I don't have the inclination to wade through very detailed and lengthy discussions about plant domestication. I totally lost interest after finishing chapter 8, which is about half way through the book. It switches over and starts talking about domesticating animals in chapter 9. And Part 2 of the book (which is all about food production) lasts until the end of chapter 10. I didn't feel like skipping over and continuing from chapter 11 because i would have doubts about what was covered in the chapters I skipped.    In summary, its a good subject to read about, but you have to have a lot of patience while reading this book.

I read it on a trip to Disneyland, and was excited just to get back to my hotel at night to read more.

It was seriously amazing
0385504225|3.0|I kind of feel sorry for Dan Brown.  He had to write a follow up to The Da Vinci Code, and we all know that it was probably not an easy task.  I think he did a pretty good job of it for the most part.  I loved how this one was set in the US, and not just the US, but Washington D.C.  The historical and landmark facts in this book are nothing short of astounding.  It never fails to amaze me how religious the founding fathers really were and how much of those beliefs are worked into our government.  One thing is for sure, this book really made me want to visit our nation's capitol.  I also enjoyed the mystery, twists and turns in this one.  Dan Brown really knows how to keep you guessing until the very end.  But (and sadly there is that but), I felt the overall message delivered in this one was a bit heavy-handed and over the top.  And the descriptions of the \\"Ancient Mysteries\\" left me rather bored at times.  It just wasn't as believable as his previous books.  I never had that moment that made me question all the things I've been taught (which I did with Da Vinci Code).  Still, a great read for those who like his previous works, but I would not expect it to wow you like the others did

B00005K9QP|5.0|It's albums like \\"Blues Breakers\\" for which the words \\"classic\\" and \\"timeless\\" were invented. Originally released by Decca Records in 1966, \\"The Beano\\" as it's sometimes known (look at the cover photo) firmly established the then 21-year-old Eric Clapton's reputation as the greatest and most innovative blues guitarist to emerge from the golden age of British R&B, a reputation he has sustained for more than 40 years.<br /><br />If you are a fan of R&B, blues or rock and have never heard this album, then prepare to have your mind blown. The original 1966 Blues Breakers: Eric Clapton just prior to forming \\"Cream\\", anchored by the great John Mayall, usually referred to as \\"The Father of British Blues\\". With John McVie on bass (who moved on to become the \\"Mac\\" of Fleetwood Mac) and Hughie Flint on drums, you have the perfect tight, energy-filled R&B line-up from the mid-sixties.<br /><br />(There is a guest appearance by Dennis Healey on trumpet - not the Dennis Healey who was later to become UK Finance Minister, surely? He was definitely a musician. Anyone know for sure?)<br /><br />Even after the passage of decades, these numbers sound crisp and fresh and will have you dancing round the room. I have the original vinyl album from 1966, and the CD is better. The sound is crisper and deeper, and there are two bonus tracks - \\"Lonely Hearts\\" and \\"Bernard Jenkins.\\"<br /><br />Clapton's guitar solo in the middle of \\"Key to Love\\" remains for me the quintessential example of the perfect 60-second solo: tight, disciplined, fast, virtuoso, clean, imaginative, pushing the main theme and, jazz-style, bringing it back to the root with perfect timing.<br /><br />The music of The Blues Breakers has been endlessly imitated, covered, extended, and used as a benchmark by thousands of bands world wide for the past 44 years.<br /><br />But it's never, ever been equalled.

079072961X|5.0|Please note that I saw this movie on TV so I can't speak to the quality of the video transfer or its features (although, based on the negative reviews here, it sounds like it wasn't that good).<br /><br />I watched this movie recently after a hiatus of 17 years and it held up very well. Despite the length of the movie, it never drags and the suspense just keeps mounting from beginning to end. I read that the train wreck was real, in an age before CGI, making that one of the great action sequences of all time.<br /><br />Lee and Ford are perfect in their roles, and the supporting cast does an excellent job as well. There are just no false notes anywhere with the characters in this movie, not to mention all the spellbinding action. You're better off watching this one again on a slow night rather than most of the stuff currently coming out of Hollywood.<br /><br />My only quip is that I think the phony tissue samples would have been discovered during the drug's FDA approval process--especially considering they were said to be from the same liver--but this is a minor point considering the movie's overall strengths. All in all still a great flick that rewards watching more than once.

B00006NSGX|5.0|Yes, I'm a life-long Clapton fan so I'm admittedly biased. This album, however, is truly fantastic. I bought this when it was first released. The review here is based on a copy I bought for a friend since this is the CD set I always end up buying as a gift for friends who are EC fans. I saw the closing concert of this tour at the Hollywood Bowl. This CD set does a great job of capturing the excitement of that show. This is an amazing collection of musicians, including old standbys Steve Gadd and Nathan East along with Billy Preston, Andy Fairweather-Low and David Sancious. The whole band is tight and trades inspired solos throughout the performance. It was a real pleasure to see (and hear) Billy Preston here and Sancious' sax-like solo on the Yahama BC3 breath-controlled synth makes this performance of Badge my favorite of the six recordings of it I have in my collection. This set is a must-have for any EC fan and an important set for any lover of blues rock. Get the DVD too. This was an exceptional tour by an exceptional group of musicians and this CD set captures the experience.
1439163855|4.0|feeling sick and stuck in the house, i picked this one up and finished it in a couple days. the writing style is simple and straightforward, with moments that made me laugh out loud and others that made me cry. picoult switches between the viewpoint of each of the characters to provide the same story from various perspectives. this masterful use of characterization and storytelling really draws the plot together all the way to the unforgettable conclusion.<br /><br />the story is intriguing, about anna, a 13 girl genetically chosen for her ability to be a perfect donor for her older sister kate, who has a rare form of leukemia. over the years, anna donates blood, platelets, marrow and finally, is asked to donate her kidney. the family dynamic is put into a whirlwind when anna seeks the counsel of an attorney for medical emancipation from her parents.<br /><br />the story brings up interesting ethical issues surrounding stem cell research, designer babies, as well as parenting and the difficult choices a family must face in the wake of a disease like leukemia.<br /><br />there were definitely points that the side stories seemed a little over the top, but ultimately, i think the primary themes were well drawn and delivered.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I have watched every Sherlock Holmes TV show and remake movies with different characters playing Sherlock and John, and I must say I think this was a great modernized SH for todays technology lovers but it still managed to remain in the dark days of it's time.  Robert was great as Sherlock he put me in mind of the one I remember the best and love Jeremy Brett it seemed the two are one in there portrayals. It was delightful and really hot. The Blueray to me wasn't that dynamic could have took it or leaved it, because this setting is in a dark humor, or darken setting for the times, but otherwise very nice details. I loved Robert and Jude they worked well in this movie. I Hope they do another one!
0393072231|5.0|Michael' excellent book presents one slice of the complex financial mess. It reads like a story, not just a presentation of facts. If this is your first book on the subject, then it will wake you up to a new world. If it is not the first book you have read on the recent meltdown, then you will learn more details from a perspective different than what other books provide. The book is about the perspective of the people who shorted the mortgage backed bonds and related financial derivates. Those people saw disaster ahead back in 2005 and 2006 and were shocked that the supposed smart people did not see it coming. And there is the question as to whether actions of Goldman Sachs people who had a large part in creating the disaster were based on mistakes or dishonesty.   Some criticize the book because it doesn't present the entire story. The entire story is too big for one book. There are a lot of good books to read about the background and details of the financial mess and ideas on how the situtation might be improved. We might as well try to be optimistic.  Here is a short list of related books: Sellout by Gasparino, House of Cards by Cohan, The Two Trillion Dollar Meltdown by Morris, Freefall by Stiglitz, Bad Money by Phillips, The Road From Ruin by Bishop, The Greatest Trade Ever by Zuckerman, And Then the Roof Caved In by Faber, The Murder of Lehman Brothers by Tibman, It Takes a Pillage by Prins, 13 Bankers by Johnson  Read The Ascent of Money by Ferguson for the interesting story of the history of money.     I am glad that Michael Lewis wrote the book. He has made it popular to learn about what is really going on in the world of money. It can't hurt to have an educated population. Hopefully people that read The Big Short will read other related books to learn even more and get involved.
B002RAREAK|4.0|Let me start off by saying this album is pretty good. I think this album could improve a little bit, but it's a good effort, way better than \\"Here I Stand\\". This album reminds me of \\"Confession,\\" \\"My Way\\", and \\"8701\\" with a new style mixed all together. However I am a little disappointed, I wish they didn't edit the album. I think most of the songs are catchy, but I am not a huge fan of most of his ballads, such as \\"Mars VS Venus\\", but I am sure they will grow on me. Other words nice effort. Way to go Usher!!!
B000063DGC|5.0|Ozzy's best live album without question, `Tribute' received a belated release (understandably) five years after its first conception as a result of the death of the mercurial Randy Rhoads. It is still hard to believe that much of this man's legacy rests on only three albums (not counting the two Quiet Riot LPs). Goes to show you how profound Randy's influence has been over all these years (much like Hendrix and Duane Allman, who had similar short careers).   `Tribute' featured Ozzy's best live band in their only album together as both Tommy Aldridge and Rudy Sarzo were NOT on `Diary' despite the false credits on that album.  `Tribute' also fulfills my requirements of a classic live album as it features a legendary artist in his prime performing some of his greatest songs when they were still fresh. \\"I Don't Know\\", \\"Crazy Train\\", \\"Flying High Again\\", \\"Suicide Solution\\" and \\"Mr. Crowley\\" are all dressed to impress with \\"Solution\\" acting as Randy's solo showcase (albeit too short!) My one and only gripe is that while all of `Blizzard' is featured only two songs from `Diary' get an airing which I guess is understandable since most of `Tribute' was recorded before the latter record was finished but it is a shame that \\"Over the Mountain\\" or \\"You Can't Kill Rock n' Roll\\" were not included. Still well worth a download or two especially for \\"Crazy Train\\" for those of you that are tired of the studio version.  `Tribute' features a madman and a true guitar god both in their primes and for that it is a godsend and a must buy!
B0000714BP|5.0|I love this movie and this was a great price for it new on DVD.
B001TOD92C|5.0|This movie gives us the \\"behind the scenes\\" of the lives of proessional fighters. The things that go on in their lives besides all the fighting and wrestling and roars of the fans. The family problems, health issues, and relationships.      Mickey Roorke plays the role of a wrestler who has been doing the sport since the 80s. Before performing in an event being a rematch with one of his old aversaries, he experiences a heart attack. His doctors tell him to stop wrestling not matter what. In an attempt to not spend the rest of his life all alone, he tries to get back in touch with his daughter and tries to get a dancer to like him and be with him too. At the same time, he tries to make a living from working in a grocery shop.      I see a lot of men choose fighting as a career just because they think its enough and fun and they also think they cannot have a job that starts from 9 till 5. Well, this is ok, but what if something goes wrong that prevents you from continuing the sport? What if you were so good at a younger age but couldn't perform as well when you got older? What if you have a family that depends on you and the money you make from fighting isn't enough anymore simply because the fans stopped like you like before? Is it really worth to sacrifice a real job that could have a bright futue (even if it starts from 9 till 5) in exchange for choosing a fighting career? Well I guess the answer is that most of the men who choose fighting as a career do not have good office job opportunities, and therefore they have no choice but to fight, especially if the money is good.

So , my sound byte for this device is, \\"it Buzzs when turned all the way down and when turned all the way up, really didn't amplify the sound much.\\"    Stay away!!
B002UNMW7O|3.0|OK let me tell you this, the 1st one is my FAVORITE movie. However, be prepared, the 2nd one is no where near as good as the 1st (sadly) They tried too much to be the same as the 1st one & quite frankly I can say I liked it, but it was definitely NOT as good as the 1st & most likely will not be watching it again for a good long while. I know they're making the 3rd already & will probably buy that one too just so I have the set, but am hoping it's better than the 2nd (crossing fingers). Would recommend you rent it before actually going out & buying it & than making the decision of whether or not it's worth the purchase. Don't buy into these folks who say it's the best movie they've ever seen & all that- I'm probably the biggest fan of the 1st & was truly disappointed ....  Hope this helps...  PEACE
B00275EGX8|5.0|The Hurt Locker is a movie about a bomb disposal team working in Baghdad during the Iraq War. It has just won six academy awards, including Best Picture.<br /><br />The main character, William James, doesn't say much, isnt particularly tall or strong, and works in bomb disposal. I didn't expect him to be the most natural war movie lead. I was very wrong.<br /><br />In his first mission, James comes to life. His bomb disposal team is called out to a site in residential Baghdad. A length of wire has been found leading into a pile of rubble. Explosives are suspected, but James refuses to use a disposal robot. He begins to walk towards the suspected bomb. A sniper could appear in any passing window. James enters the `kill zone,' the area within which an explosion would mean death. He walks slowly, glancing at a group of soldiers on his left. Suddenly a small car comes racing through, past the troops. James pulls a pistol and turns, pointing it directly at the driver, the driver stops. James steps closer, gun still pointed. Is it an insurgent? The car won't leave. James is standing next to a bomb with his gun raised. He walks to the side of the vehicle, places his gun against the temple of the frightened driver. The car withdraws. James smiles, makes a joke, and begins to dig for the bomb. He finds one, and disarms it. Then he finds a cable. Then he finds six more bombs. A man is running through a nearby window. Does he have a mobile phone? Will he trigger one of the bombs? James is still smiling with an eery calm.<br /><br />`Do you realise that everytime you suit up, everytime we go out, its life or death. You roll the dice, and you deal with it. You recognise that don't you.'<br /><br />`Yeah. Yeah I do. But I don't know why. I... I don't really think about that.'<br /><br />He seems entirely without fear, taking needless risks, ignoring senior officers, laughing off bodies. He keeps a small crate in his room of bomb triggers that nearly killed him. James becomes a fascinating character because he truly has no fear or respect for death.<br /><br />He is enigma of something between hero and serial killer, a mystery to even himself.<br /><br />On one occasion he turns to a partner he has had for a matter of weeks and asks,<br />`Do you know why I am why I am?'<br /><br />Hurt Locker is a highly unbelievable movie at times, and all things considered, perhaps not the greatest representation of the mechanics of war. But it is still in my opinion an excellent film because William James is a fascinating, deeply human main character.no fear or respect for death.

B002QGUFWE|5.0|My first review went like a cultural dissection of Gaga's greatness, her sudden emergence from pop-nobody to Queen of the 2010's Zeitgeist. I don't think she should be dismissed as just odd for the sake of odd, manufactured or temporary, I think she's bridging on a deeper art form through her performance and persona. But that can be discussed ad absurdum, instead I'll share my thoughts on her music. I consider The Fame Monser to be one cohesive album, but will go through it chronologically here.<br /><br />The Fame<br /><br />Who knew that \\"Just Dance\\" hid greatness? It's a pretty catchy song, that's undeniable, but this is obviously far from Stefani's own creation. The song opens with \\"RedOne, Konvict, Gaga\\", making her a newly hatched creation in the pop scene. Maybe there was something a little special about her even then, perhaps it was the name, but nobody knew what was to follow. Good song.<br /><br />\\"LoveGame\\" is a step in the right direction; darker, sexier, catchy as hellfire. If anything, a little underrated, quickly dismissed as drivel, but on a purely musical level, a very good song.<br /><br />\\"Paparazzi\\" may seem like it caters to the blandness of pop-radio, but the song actually deals with the sensationalism of death, the spectacle of failed celebrity and our obsessive media society, making it hugely underrated. It does work on account of the sweet and mellow vocal performance as well though.<br /><br />\\"Poker Face\\" is the thing hit singles are made of. Blending the bland and the catchy into the annals of pop history, it's one of the songs that caught the attention of not only pop-fans, when you sensed this thing was simply too catchy to be the same old pop-drivel, but were afraid to admit it. It's also a clever euphemism for bisexual secrecy, even though the lyric \\"bluffin' with my muffin\\" wasn't exactly subtle.<br /><br />\\"I Like It Rough\\" is enormously infectious and flirtaciously sexy. A song to play loud, and sing loud. One of the great unnamed gems of the albums. Very good.<br /><br />\\"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\\" was the inevitable pop single, a forgettable little romp with an equally forgettable music video. Harmless and pointless, but actually a nice counterpoint to the monstrous walking piece of art we today know as Lady Gaga.<br /><br />\\"Starstruck\\" is another song that's mellow but simply catchy. It's proven time and time again that not all memorable songs have to be huge, heavy or fast. Undiscovered, don't miss it!<br /><br />\\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\\" is one of several self-indulgent and naïve wannabe-songs on the album; after all, the album cover depicted her with diamond-covered sunglasses, not exactly screaming subtle. Half-decent.<br /><br />\\"The Fame\\" is the next egocentric material celebration-song, but the melody is too good to dismiss, so it's still a solid song, even if it makes you feel like a spoiled and privileged capitalist brat!<br /><br />\\"Money Honey\\" is on the same track as the previous two songs, and probably the weakest of all three; the trilogy of bling closes on a sour note, but at least we've gotten that out of our system now. Forgettable.<br /><br />\\"Boys Boys Boys\\" is the kind of song I imagine young female students blasting on the beach; a harmless celebration of casual flirtaciousness and burgeoning sexuality, or it can quickly be converted into her proto-gay anthem! For regular straight dudes, possibly the only Gaga song you'd have to hide in shame from.<br /><br />\\"Paper Gangsta\\" is an absolutely magnetic hip-hop / dance / R'n'B blend, which is the album's unsung diamond in my opinion; mellow and with a very pronouced hip-hop flair, it's still sure to cement itself in your head and stay there for weeks upon weeks. I still find myself humming it in the shower or while working. Great stuff!<br /><br />\\"Brown Eyes\\" is Gaga's first attempt at an all-out ballad, but it failed to turn any heads. A little too on the nose, very slow and pronounced, a far cry from the catchiness that surrounds it. Weak!<br /><br />\\"Summerboy\\" is decent at best, the same innocent pop-blandness that you'll hear on the radio. No harm in nodding along though.<br /><br />\\"Disco Heaven\\" is a merciless throwback to the 70's; high heels, big hairstyles, awful pants, you name it. An absolute in-your-face disco song, none of that heavy dance music going on here. Good.<br /><br />\\"Retro Dance Freak\\" is a softer dance-pop track, which can be appreciated for what it is; mellow, easy listened goodness, and a nice slow sendoff before we're thrown into the epic world of the Monster.<br /><br />The Fame Monster<br /><br />\\"Bad Romance\\" will go down in history; it's the track that turned Lady Gaga from pop-menace to art-monster, a brave, odd, heavy, eurodance track with what has become her signature \\"stuttering\\" and fantastically theatrical vocalizations. An immortal song and tribute to the Little Monsters. Fantastic, with a music video to match.<br /><br />\\"Alejandro\\" is an equally brave song, but for all the different reasons; this sadly romantic mid-tempo tune holds both heartache and joy as Stefani bids farewell to her old boyfriends. The video short film's merging with Steven Klein turned Gaga from an innovative pop artist into a merciless art-ist; aesthetically, musically and fashion-wise, it cemented her place in history alongside Madonna and Michael Jackson.<br /><br />\\"Monster\\" is a good fun dance-song, dealing largely with casual sexual encounters, disguised in a Red Riding Hood-landscape. Nothing hugely innovative, but a fun song to play at any given time.<br /><br />\\"Speechless\\" is the second attempt at a heartfelt but powerful ballad, and despite Gaga's skill on the piano, the melody and tempo acts like a roadblock party pooper, and the song is probably best suited for live performances.<br /><br />\\"Dance In The Dark\\" is another example of Gaga's simple magnetism; if you have the melody, they will come. And keep coming.<br /><br />\\"Telephone\\" sees Stefani join forces with Beyonc&eacute;, and is probably the catchiest song ever made in the history of music. Opening with a subtle little guitar hook, the song explodes into a ferocious dance club anthem; both relevant and enormous, it's the iPhone-song for an entire generation, and one of the very best songs she's ever done. The video is an exploitation celebration equal parts campy, innovative and hilarious, only further making history of the mysterious name Gaga.<br /><br />\\"So Happy I Could Die\\" talks about the joys of red wine and the wonderful act of self-love, a mellow song with a beautiful live rendition. A far better inspiration to emulate than the shallow stuff going on in The Fame, perfect for a rainy sunday.<br /><br />\\"Teeth\\" is the final track on the evolutionary and revolutionary Fame Monster, with an almost tribal-like rhythm it's like a primeval sexual invocation, taking your thoughts to both vampires and youngsters in clubs.on the radio. No harm in nodding along though.    \\"Disco Heaven\\" is a merciless throwback to the 70's; high heels, big hairstyles, awful pants, you name it.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|well, i waited until the smoke cleared, the hoopla ceased and some objectivity could be brought to the subject, relatively speaking.  i recently acquired both the stereo and mono editions of this set, without extremely high expectations, actually.   but a pleasant surprise they are.  people must first realize the limitations of recording techniques when these albums were made and then...be very happily shocked by what has been achieved here.  sure, there are points one could nit-pick, but they are minor and do not hinder the detailing in these superlative remasters.  already timeless music is given more resonance, greater finesse and the clarity to knock you off your chair.  in short, if you love the beatles, you should really hear these.  1964 suddenly doesn't seem that long ago.
0143038419|2.0|Let me first say alot of people just love this book. My only question to the writer is why couldn't she have just stayed in the USA and had the same journey? She could have eaten in some 5 star resturants. Next, she could have went to a women's shelter, soup kitchen, cancer hospital, or  Hospice, and yes the v word volunteer. I think then she would have really found God. The third part of her journey was love. Oh wait you don't find riches there just diamonds in the rough. With all the money from the advance on the book she could have did alot more for her self and people in need  . I now understand why Julia Roberts is playing the lead roll in the movie. For the first time I hope the movie is better than the book.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Review on PX<br />Its true there is  still a lill hisin zzzzzzzzzzzz sound like someone el said before it's  like an old tape player/walk man like when theres no songs playing or when tape is about just finished besides that once the game starts u hear nothing... I think the reason for this is because its not DIGITAL.<br /><br />Don't really know the dif/between the p21 and Px21 but i tell u what these are my 1st set of headsets and im super happy the sound just blows u away in battlefield bad company 2 i only have used it for 30 mins and going crazy<br /><br />The sorround sound is just awesome plus i cant even complained i paid 49 bucks for these  brand new.<br /><br />i think that its well worth  the 79 bucks that they ask for unlike all the other pricy ones i did research on like the tritons but oh well who am i to tell u what to buy.
B00005JLR2|5.0|In reviews I read before purchasing this I found some stating this was one of those that got caught up in Disney politics and didn't get the publicity it might should have.  Now having seen it myself I agree.  The story is a take on Treasure Island set in a slightly different future.  The animation is great and the voice work just as good.  Its amazing to see how a big smart company like Diseny can screw things up from time to tiem and not stand behind a product.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This is one of George Harrison's most complex, imaginative, eclectic, diverse yet homogenous album. It is so revelatory about George's mind, soul, musical spirit, love, integrity and quests that it could be entitled \\"Inside George.\\" Indeed, the dedicated musician, the spiritual seeker, the insightful intellect, the dry humourist reveals with every song.    All the songs on the album are catchy and savantly arranged, but three of them excel, in my opinion, in rendering George's genius and moods: his luminous spirit sparkles in Pisces Fish; nostalgia, regrets, and introspection blend in the beautiful Looking For My Life, whereas his flamaboyant irony and mystical tendencies dance together like in a raga rhythm in Brainwashed.     Any Road, with the \\"Give me plenty of that guitar\\" introduction is light, rythmical and exhales good mood and serenity.    P2 Vatican Blues is at least interesting - the subject is daring if not taboo, the lyrics remind of his irony in Piggies and the melody is really catchy with its tasty guitar riff.    Rising Sun, maybe the most Beatlesque song in this album - strongly autobiographical if you dig beneath the cryptic lyrics; heavy and inspirational.    Marwa Blues, colourful, soulful, larger than life, wonderful instrumental. The guitars are fantastic.    Stuck Inside a Cloud, so luminous despite its inherent sadness. Like a ray of hope or a beautiful memory for the condemned, the lost, the unhappy ones.     Run So Far - gentle and sweet as George himself. Hunting tune, wonderful performance. His voice is just splendid in this song. \\"Lonely days, blue guitar\\"...    I'll Never Get Over You, enigmatic to say the least. It reminds of Something for some reason. The guitars are incredible in this song.    Devil in the Deep Blue Sea, maybe his most McCartney song. (Sounds a bit like Paul's inpired from the `30's  Honey Pie on the White Album). Serene, light and smiley.    Rocking Chair In Hawaii, a bit country, a bit blues, joyful, relaxing and dreamy.    No exaggeration: Brainwashed is one of the best Rock albums of our times. Addictive. Haunting.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This was a long book, but I barely noticed.  Mr. Larsson really draws a great character.  Lisbeth Salander, one of his main characters is so difficult to like but continually becomes more and more emotionally engaging.  I'm so upset that Mr. Larsson cannot make anymore novels, but you should read this one and check out the rest of the series like I will.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|This is the 2nd album I've owned from A-Keys (the 1st being \\"As I Am\\"), and I don't regret either of the purchases. What I love about this album is that it flows well, nice production/beats, beautiful words, and well-sung (for the most part). My only problem is that it's nothing outstanding and in a year from now can be easily forgotten. Nonetheless here's my breakdown:    The Best Songs:  Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart  Like The Sea  Unthinkable (I'm Ready)  Wait Til You See Me Smile  Love Is My Disease  Empire State of Mind Part 2    The \\"Ok/Decent\\" Songs:  Put It in a Love Song-This song seems more for Beyonce than A-Keys-def not a strong track on the album  This Bed-Her high voice singing in the chorus gets annoying afterwhile-production saves this song  Distance & Time-If we didn't have a \\"No One\\" in 2007 this song will be one of the bests but this sounds exactly like it with different words    The songs that we could've done without:  Doesn't Mean Anything   How It Feels To Fly    Overall another solid album but Ms. Keys I highly recommend to all R&b fans if you like songs more like \\"Try Sleeping with a broken\\" rather than \\"Put It in a Love Song\\"
B000NTPDSW|4.0|This is a dark, grainy but authentic version. This is not a show off your system bluray.
B002S0OBN2|4.0|In my openion it's not up to Cats and Phantom ofthe Opera and other works.
B00007DWRZ|5.0|Arnaldo Antunes is clearly a unique character. His voice, several octaves below most people's, sounds very cool and unique. His arrangements ideas and instrumentation s and totally unique and a refreshing break from the normal sounds of music.
0792846710|4.0|killer klowns from outer space is the best. i love the balloon track dogs, cotton candy people, shadow dinasours that eat real people. i love it for being a cheesy moive, just sad it was a vhs. recently gave my vhs player away so was unable to play it.
0439813786|5.0|Terrific book! The story flies by, and immerses the reader in drawings, photos, film stills. And the characters - the characters! They're not your two-dimensional Enid Blyton characters, oh no. These are real characters, with likable and unlikable traits. Those who first come across as villains are given reasons why they act the way they do. And to balance it out, the \\"good guys\\" have their share of nasty qualities: thieves, liars, and so on.    The drawings are meticulously rendered, and beautifully executed. As someone who draws exclusively in pencil myself - the drawings were so beautiful, this jaded twentysomething wanted to cry.    I look forward to discovering more of Selznick's works. This is a writer and illustrator to watch.
0385335989|3.0|I LOVED the first 3 books in the Outlander series, but was somewhat disappointed in this book.  It wasn't terrible, but wasn't great.
0143038419|1.0|Like many other reviewers, I too, found this book irritating and sometimes interesting.  No one can seem to decipher what her actual marital problems were--geez, a house in the country, a loving man who wants to start a family and a career in writing for a travel magazine- the author suffered terribly- I can see why she needed to split and \\"find herself\\".     One other reviewer wrote that the author totally ignored all the wonderful art and history in Rome and focused on the food, men,  wine and fine Italian lingerie instead. how banal!      Her time in India was excruciatingly boring (I had the flu, was off work and decided to keep reading anyway)... maybe she could have found God in NYC through some selfless service trying to help others rather than her excessive self absorbtion and indulgence in food, alcohol and buying fine Italian lingerie. And she's depressed because her adulterous relationship is ending?  Spare me...     Some of the characters and experiences sound as if they were specifically fabricated in order to write the book.  Ms. Gilbert frequently mentions how cute and attractive she still is and what exceptional people skills she possesses.     Has Ms. Gilbert ever thought of picking up a Bible? Praying a rosary? (It is Rome)...  You can pray anywhere you are at- God is not living specifically in India nor do you have to spend 6 hrs a day meditating to find him. You don't need a guru or to travel thousands of miles away to commune with God.  Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Light, not some Swami Rama woman who won't even let her \\"holy\\" name be devulged.      I can't believe this woman was paid a chunk of money to write this dribble! I don't find her to be godly or enlightened at all--just very self-absorbed and still in need of the saving grace of Jesus Christ.
B001WCBPCW|4.0|This is album is easy listening and a great one for the car. Turn it up and you will be head head bopping, toe tapping and hand banging on the steering wheel all the way down the road with a big grin on yer face. I love this album and recomend you add this to your collection. Because it is so easy listening I would recomend putting it on your shelf, leaving it there for long periods - only bring it out every so often so that it is not played to death.
B00004W221|5.0|This is an excellent movie!  Based on a true story, it is all about perserverance, and I would recommend it to everyone.  This is a movie that can be watched over and over.
B0000CABBW|5.0|a coming of age girl trying to impress her father and the people she lives with. Its inspiring and a good watch. I kept it to watch again some time or to loan out to friends.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|the movie is really spectacular, but most is too much unrealistc, more like a comics.
0061537969|5.0|I was kind of skeptical when I heard the book was narrated by a dog, but as soon as I started I couldnt put it down. The story is about a family and its hardships seen through the eyes of a dog. I especially liked how the author related racing tips to life itself. This book is for dog lovers and even for cat lovers. Very well written and a definite fast read. Enjoy!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|\\"Lost in Austen\\" was good fun!  It kept my attention even though I've probably wstched \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" over a hundred times, in every version. Someone with a good imagination took a classic, added to it, changed it up a bit and yet kept the basic entertainment value.  I highly recommend it to Austen fans!    Charlotte Stout
0061537969|4.0|\\"The Art of Racing in The Rain\\" was a very inspiring book that left my eyes brimming with tears of sorrow, tears of frustration, and best of all tears of joy. Garth Stein captures the reader immediately with his unique perspective, through the family dog's eyes. This is a tale of enduring love: the love for a dog, the love for a wife, the love for a daughter, and the love for racing. It is a tale of persistence even when you have nothing left to give. Stein puts the human life and its meaning best through the last dying thoughts of a dog named Enzo:  \\"I know this much about racing in the rain. I know it is about balance, it is about anticipation and patience. ..But racing in the rain is also about the mind! It is about owning one's own body...It is about believing that you are not you; you are everything. And everything is you\\".  I believe Stein has several strengths as a writer. He did a phenomenal job of attaching the reader to the characters so that when they feel a certain way so does the reader. He also was an expert of suspense; there were times when I could not put the book down because I needed to know what happened next.  Overall I was very pleased with this novel it truly was quite engaging.
0375842209|5.0|This book isn't going to be the easiest read you'll ever pick up.  To begin it's narrated by death and as you might guess, death has a lot more to tell you about than just the simple facts.  The tale follows a little girl (the book thief, herself) as she grows up in Nazi Germany--so if you're looking for light, fluffy material this isn't the best choice for you.     There are a lot of stories about the holocaust, so many touching stories, but Zusak does a remarkable job of making this one personal.  It's focus on this one little girl who steals books long before she knows how to read them makes the pain and suffering of the holocaust that much closer to us.    Zusak's writing style is ruthlessly beautiful and haunting.  He even has his deathly narrator warn you in advance of exactly what will happen and tells you not blame *him* when you're upset. And then when the big painful moments come, you don't blame the narrator, but you can't help but shed some tears and ache a bit.  The writing in this book is eloquent, the pacing is perfect and the characters will stay with you long after you've reached the last page.  If you're looking for a book that you'll remember long after you're done with it, this is a must read for you.
B002JWD6AS|1.0|I tried desperately to enjoy this book. I wanted to like it, but it just fell flat. I had to force myself to finish it. I felt that most of the characters lacked depth. I found myself skipping to Sam's perspective most of the time, as Grace's kept putting me to sleep. It was a lackluster read with a predictable ending.
0786856297|4.0|Amazon!<br /><br />You have the old jacket advertised, which was what I wanted.  You shipped me the newer jacket.  Poor description!  Just wanted to let everyone know (I realize the old jacket is a little ugly, but I wanted the classic edition...)
B00004Y6O7|5.0|You definately have to crank up the volume when listening to this CD because it will make you sing the lyrics so so loud!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|and the reason it is it's because of \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" One of the most mature songs she's ever done in her career. It's this eerie sensual song with great asian romantic instrumentation and deep meaninful lyrics.    For the people that don't like this song, i'm guessing they're still stuck in her Oops i Did it again days. Because it's the best song of her career. the lyrics blow me away from the very begining    \\"I'm not ashamed of the things that I dream  I find myself flirting with the verge of obscene  Into the unknown, I will be bold  I'm going to places I can be out of control\\"    the only song i couldn't get into was the song featuring the Ying Yang Twins, other than that, the whole album is a complete knockout, and \\"Touch of My Hand\\" still remains my favorite song from her decade long career.
0891419063|5.0|I bought this book because of the HBO series The Pacific. My father was there during WWII as a Sailor. The book was excellent . I especially liked the fact that it was from the man on the line view. Other books i have read were not as gritty and the real facts of life as this. It was how they lived, getting ammo, food, taking a crap. The friendship and shared reality that they may not live. One of the best I have read in a while. I have recomended it to several of my friends.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|I give this movie a '5' star rating for the excellent theme but a '3' for the overall script.    This movie isn't as 'gritty' as the first and I miss that aspect.  The script is also not nearly as creative with many of the same scenes of the first recreated in the second with a different twist.  I was hoping for some more 'off the wall' originality that I loved in the first film!    Many of the same characters are back for an encore performance but the script doesn't do them the justice like the first one did.  The new characters seem to lack the originality and flair of the original cast.  There are some really funny moments that do make the movie worth seeing.    Overall I felt that the movie was too short.  It would have been so much better if they had done less with more depth.  Though the movie was very exciting, and keeps you hooked, I had so much hope for the sequel following such a great original.  IF you haven't seen the first one, DO IT!      The ending leaves the story line primed for another movie in this chain, and I hope they do it sooner rather than later with some more creativity added to the storyline.
0375842209|5.0|I am just writing to counter the negative reviews on this book. I picked up my copy from the used book section of my library. I had it in a box for over six months before I opened it. I read it in just a couple of days and during that time I could not wait to read more. I want my children to read it and would also recommend it to my friends. I enjoyed everything about the writing style and the fact that the story is told by death. I am not a person that sits and tears the story apart and tries to find all the errors or mistakes that the author makes. I can say that it is not the typical type of book that I read but I enjoyed everything about it. Please give it a try, you will not be disappointed.

B00000E2VC|3.0|I think most aficionados of Chopin would agree that the Mazurkas are the hardest of his works to get right. The underlying form is a folk dance in 3/4 time, to which Chopin adds cross rhythms and eccentric accents. Combining these two aspects allows much room for poetic license. For some reason, Michelangeli ignores the challenge and plows through these ten mazurkas as if they had not a touch of nuance, poetry, or idiosyncrasy. I don't think that tossing a problem out the window is that same as solving it. Every once in a while, as in Op. 67 no. 4, he unbends a little, but I fail to hear the magic other reviewers do. What's to like in such impersonal pianism?<br /><br />Michelangeli's touch returns in the C# minor Prelude, where he weaves a lovely aura of lyric melancholy. The less-than-generous recital ends with a single Ballade and Scherzo. In the G minor Ballade there's a tone poem in miniature, and my preference is for a good deal of dramatic and emotional contrast. Michelangeli has different ideas. The opening is tame and leads smoothly into the first section, which is kept quite low key for the most part. Is he even involved, or are we supposed to adapt to a patrician classicism? The phrasing is kept under tight rein, although as always the pianist's control is impeccable. I suppose the intent was to unify the work's variety into a single seamless arc. If you've grown tired of pianists who bang their way through the B-flat minor Scherzo, Michelangeli applies the same restraint to it, with broad pacing, languorous rubato, and an air of uninvolvement. I would give this misguided outing two stars but there's no denying Michelangeli's artistry.
1590171993|2.0|This is one of Tom Hanks's 5 favorite books, according to a recent interview/article.  A review on the back cover calls it a \\"perfect novel.\\"  While it is not badly-written and uses vocabulary well, nothing is described using any of the five senses.  Reading the book, I don't know what anything looks like, smells like, tactilely feels like, etc.  My main complaint is that every character lacks the expression of emotion of any kind.  The story covers decades, yet, every character is flat of emotion and either doesn't fulfill any purpose in life or doesn't attain any joy from the fulfillment.  The author is clearly intelligent; it is the story I do not consider worth reading, as it does not provide enjoyment or lesson learned.
B000094HMU|5.0|I have said that once I see Turandot my life will be complete.  I have seen Turnadot at the Met and my life has been made good.  I have been reliving the wonderful experience on VHS but now having it on DVD is a true continuation of that enjoyment.  \\"Turnadot\\" says it all. It is the apex of the pyramid for all operas.  I became an opera fan and a Met supporter because of my being truly overwhelmed with seeing Turnadot. I have purchased works by Marton, Domingo and other opera creations because of this introduction to opera. First on PBS tv, then the live performance at the Met, and now I get continuous entertainment with the DVD.  The best opera performers are here. The picture and sound quality is excellent. I love it!  I still love it!  Life is good! Enjoy!
B0011NT4FC|5.0|If the band ever gets the rights back to their first 4 albums and does a brand new mix from the original tapes, I'm right there.  Until then, this remaster is the best one out there.  It managed to restore a couple seconds of some little piano riff that was cut out of Columbia's CD pressing, so that was a neat treat.  The mix is clear and loud, without being over compressed, the EQing is very well done, The bass end is rich and the high end is clear, but still has that fat vintage sound to the whole disc.  I did an A/B comparison to the Columbia CD in Sony Vegas and found that the Repertopire disc is also a little faster. Not by much, you'd never notice it and the pitch is the same. But when I lined up the same song from each disc, by the end of each song they'd be slightly off. I think this gives the music a little bit more energy, although really you'd never notice a difference.
6305428387|5.0|I received this order promptly and in good condition.  Thanks,  Polly L Hall
B000BM3ZUE|4.0|The sound is good, clear and well balanced in terms of EQ. However it's clear this is not from the original tapes. The telltale bent note at the beginning of the title track gives this away. Until the rights revert to the band allowing them to remix and remaster the original tapes, this is about as close as we'll get.

B001EO2UKO|5.0|What I like most about this Album of Dido's is how much it makes me think about lost friends. The first time I listened to The Day Before Today I knew I had to get this album. The emotions Dido was able to convey through her words in that one song were astonishing to me. I do not think anything has ever touched my \\"soul\\" as much as that song did and continues to do.

B002YIHO7I|3.0|Sade has this nice niche, that fluid peaceful sound uniquely her own. However, it's a matter of how many times you want to hear that same song. Her singing certainly doesn't show much range and doesn't take any risks. Same, for the most part with the music. Songs since the start of her career to this cd have only very subtle differences. I like the first two songs on this cd and track 8. The others seem rather lame, lacking any spark or creativity. So I'll play those three tracks when in my Sade mood, or tracks from previous albums, won't hear much difference. Unless you are a huge Sade fan that feels you must have everything she puts out, then I would question the worthiness of letting your money go on this one.
B002VECM6S|4.0|It is a very nice movie from start to the end. It is human, filled with emotions and Sandra B. has outdone herself.  It was excellent to watch a movie without violence, nonsense fights and vicious murders. It helped me remember that there are still nice people around and that \\"all you need is love.\\"  :)    You'll enjoy the movie.
B00328G4V6|4.0|Ofcourse leftover material will never equal the greatness of the first 3 Hendrix albums. However this is mighty fine music. Valleys of Neptune is a fine song, but you can tell with further work Hendrix would have made it into one of his best. Stone Free was never a song I cared for, but this is the best version I've heard yet. The long songs are pretty good, but too long for me. Lullaby for the summer is a great instrumental. I especially enjoy that one. This is a great version of Fire. It's nice to hear another take of that great song, although it's not way different from the original. Sunshine of your love is a nice treat, different from the cream version. What I'm saying is this is a very enjoyable cd showing off the talent of Hendrix. It's good all the way thru, but is 1/2 to one star below the original living works of the great guitar master. These are not throw away songs. These are definately at a good to very good level. So add to your Hnedrix experience. I really enjoy listening to this new Hendrix material. Glad I bought it.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|One thing no one has said about this album is how damn weird it is.  Although they were famous for their eclecticism - they played in pretty nearly every style they could get their hands on - the Beatles concentrated on love songs for most of their career, with a few exceptions.  Here, at the end, is where the exceptions took over.<br /><br />Beatle lore tells us that by the time the lads got to this point, they all knew they were just about finished with each other.  The \\"Let It Be\\" project had opened up the cracks between them into chasms, and they were ready to call it a day, but decided to record once more, in order to finish the thing up properly and say goodbye.  It wasn't all sweetness and light, of course - Lennon and McCartney disagreed about how the album should run, with Lennon wanting a stripped-down, non-conceptual collection of rock songs and McCartney working with George Martin to put together a linked suite of the loose musical bits floating around.  Fertile ground for all kinds of bickering.<br /><br />Now, Lennon sometimes referred to the Beatles as sort of like a marriage, and even on the eve of divorce they behaved accordingly - they reached a compromise.  Lennon got his wish on Side 1, McCartney on Side 2.  For that reason, this is one of those albums that doesn't get very good service from the CD format, but we can overlook that.<br /><br />Even the straight-ahead love songs, both by George Harrison, bump up against ambivalence - \\"You're asking me will my love grow / I don't know, I don't know\\".  As for the rest of these numbers, what can you say about things like a description of a grotesque named Flat Top, a 1950s-style vocal workout, a kid's song about love on the ocean bottom and a charming little ditty about a serial-killing medical student?  How are you supposed to react to an album where both sides interrupt themselves in the middle of a musical phrase?  Why did these guys wait until now to include the first recorded drum solo by Ringo Starr of all people, not to mention the first Beatles guitar jam between George, Paul and John?  What does it mean when John Lennon tells us that one of these numbers is Beethoven played backwards?  What is this, a joke?<br /><br />Not exactly.  Whatever the atmosphere in the studio was, \\"Abbey Road\\" is the sound of the Beatles cleaning out the attic before the move and getting a huge kick out of the things they find.  It's not that they recorded old Beatle numbers for this record - they did that on \\"Let It Be\\" the previous year.  These songs and fragments were pretty new.  It's more like they were clearing out their heads, and we all know how strange one's stray thoughts can be.  Anyone's mental attic can reveal all kinds of oddities - the Beatles' attic would naturally contain treasures, wouldn't it?<br /><br />None of which would mean anything if everyone wasn't on top form, including George Martin, the Beatles' producer.  \\"Abbey Road\\" sounds terrific, including the echo-chamber stuff, the ocean-floor and tape-hiss sound effects here and there, and the swoops from that newfangled invention called the synthesizer.<br /><br />The four guys tried all kinds of new things, such as Paul singing below John for a change (I know he said he was too shy to sing backing vocals on \\"Come Together\\", but it sure sounds like him) and the bunch of them chanting semi-Italian gibberish.  There's that guitar jam, where the lines are so distinctive you can identify who plays what without even trying hard.  And then there's the editing, especially on Side 2, that turns the last fifteen minutes or so into a referendum on the 1960s and the Beatles' whole career.  It combines resentment and appreciation, from \\"Boy, you're gonna carry that weight a long time\\" to \\"And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make\\", and everything from strings to one of George's sweetest guitar licks.  It even ends with a joke, just so we don't take the whole business too seriously.<br /><br />Inshort, \\"Abbey Road\\" may very well be the Beatles album for people who don't like the Beatles (there are such people, you know).  There are those who find this band too pop-oriented, not bluesy enough, not skillful enough on their instruments - you can't really say any of that about \\"Abbey Road\\".  As polished as it is, there's something that sounds casual about it, which makes sense.  The band was breaking up, had nothing to prove and nothing to lose.  Even the famous album cover shot came about because the four of them couldn't be bothered to do anything more complicated than go outside and cross the street.<br /><br />Speaking of which, that cover shot indicates again how peculiar the whole project turned out to be.  Simple as it is, everyone knows that it gave rise to all kinds of odd speculation.  Yeah, Paul is barefoot in the picture, his suit doesn't fit very well, he's smoking and he's out of step with the other three - so obviously this is a funeral procession with Paul as the corpse.  John's in white, so he's the preacher or even God; Ringo's in black, so he's the undertaker; and George is in work clothes, so he's the gravedigger.  Paul is dead, and the Beatles want to gently tell us so.  And people went back over the Beatles' entire catalogue looking for more evidence.<br /><br />Well, you know something?  The people got that wrong.  It wasn't Paul who was dead, it was the Beatles.  It was nice of them to give us something so excellent, musically and visually, to play with as a goodbye present.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Here's to absent friends and what they left behind.for people who don't like the Beatles (there are such people, you know).

0393072231|4.0|I am probably one of the only people here for whom Michael Lewis' \\"other book\\" is [[ASIN:039306901X Home Game: An Accidental Guide to Fatherhood]] rather than \\"Liar's Poker\\" or \\"Moneyball.\\"  I mention that because even though I listen to enough public radio to have a basic background knowledge about what happened in the financial meltdown, I rarely read books like \\"The Big Short.\\"  Yet, this time it seemed important as a citizen to get the inside scoop about how out of control Wall Street's system of incentives had gotten.  Lewis' account is compelling, though I will say the esoteric financial terminology won't be easy to swallow unless you have been following the news.  I recommend listening to the \\"This American Life\\" radio show's series of episodes on \\"The Giant Pool of Money\\" first to learn about \\"tranches,\\" CDOs and credit default swaps, and then reading this book.    Lewis pinpoints compelling characters to follow as the financial system unravels--falling apart much more slowly than it should have, actually, given the underlying rottenness of it's leveraged, risky investments.  I won't go into all those details but will say this is an engaging book that almost achieves page-turner status.  I did feel incredibly queasy at the end realizing how much stupidity and corruption there is in our financial system and how illogical many aspects of the government bailout were.  I wish the bailout had been more than a coda at the end of the book.  I know Lewis is going for the drama of the narrative, but I would have liked more guidance on a call to action.  Where should we villagers show up with our torches and pitchforks?  Which politicians have a clue and some hope of fixing our broken system?  Where are the other potential whistleblowers?  Meredith Whitney is mentioned briefly in the prologue to little effect.  What about Brooksley Born and other officials and regulators who saw the flaws in the system, but were stifled and dismissed?  The book could have used more background on how ended up with the messed up system we have, and how it could possibly be salvaged going forward.  I realize that could be material for several books but there should have been more here.  Still, four stars overall, and this admittedly complicated subject matter and recent history is something that all Americans should be reading up on.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|The Discovery Channel manages to destroy yet another BBC masterpiece by substituting David Attenborough's beautiful narration with the dry, uninspiring words of Oprah Winfrey.  Sadly, the Oprah version just cannot compare.  Attenborough has dedicated his life to the study and preservation of wildlife, and his passion for the subject makes the UK version far more enjoyable.  Don't waste your money on the Oprah version.
B000063DIR|5.0|The 2011 legacy edition is the original album.  All the original players are on it.  The second disc has a unreleased live concert featuring the great randy roades and others.  This is mixed into the other reviews. The 2002 remaster had a bonus track and then re-recorded bass and drums.  This one does not. I kept the 2002 remaster for the bonus song. Same with blizzard of oz remaster.  So it's a great thing to get this restored on this new edition. It's not remixed. It's wonderful. And this is how good metal was back in the day.  Melodic and well made.  I would say only get the 2002 remasters for the bonus songs.  Get this one because it's the original and the original band members finally get song writing credit too.  Which is the right thing to do.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|Most, I think, prefer Dylan's 'Highway 61 Revisited' album over 'Bringing It All Back Home' - I find both equally revolutionary, however I find that the balance of rock and acoustic make this the more enjoyable album.<br /><br />The album starts off with a bang: 'Subterranean Homesick Blues'. 'She Belongs To Me' follows - a ballad about a woman and a man...I have read the song is about Joan Baez. 'Bob Dylans 115th Dream' is an imagery laden satire about the United States. My favorite track would be 'It's All Over Now Baby Blue' - again, some say the song is about Joan Baez, others think it is Dylan's farewell to acoustic-folk music. Whatever interpretations you derive, you cannot deny the genius of this music. All the songs on this album are of high calibre...no filler whatsoever.<br /><br />I used to dislike Dylan's electric albums A LOT. This album was a good introduction to his electric work...though I still enjoy his early acoustic works the best, 'Highway 61 Revisited' has become one of my favorites.<br /><br />If you have not heard 'Bringing It All Back Home' yet, buy this album immediately.<br /><br />5/5
1594481938|4.0|There is no question that Nick Hornby is a master of first person narrative. He finds the distinct personality and vernacular of his protagonist and keeps that voice consistent and consistently fascinating, never straying from a truly human perspective.<br /><br />What makes A Long Way Down such an extraordinary feat is that there are four narrators with four completely separate recollections of the same events and four absolutely unique points of view. The only thing this strange quartet has in common is that they all arrived on an infamous rooftop one New Years Eve intending to plunge to the pavement below to put an end to what they considered to be an intolerable dilemma. Having talked each other off the ledge--literally--they now have a bond that cannot be broken.<br /><br />As an author myself, I am in awe of Hornby's skill in keeping these voices so recognizable and true to these very flawed characters, while weaving a tale that keeps the reader turning pages, ever eager to discover what comes next. A Long Way Down is a tight-rope walk that kept this reader on the edge of my seat. I love, love, love this book.<br /><br />Rand Bishop, author Makin' Stuff Up, The Absolute Essentials of Songwriting Success, and Grand Pop.
B000053VAZ|4.0|In this movie, Johnny Depp shines as a quirky and lovable character who just needs someone to love and understand him.  Mary Stuart Masterson is very convincing as a mentally unbalanced young woman, and Aidan Quinn handles the character of the brother believably.

1594481784|4.0|As a fellow author, I've always felt a certain kinship with Nick Hornby. I think it has a lot to do with his rock 'n` roll soul. I only wish I had ten percent of his literary acumen. Hornby inhabits his protagonists as believably as Marlin Brando inhabited Stanley Kowalski. With his classic High Fidelity, Hornby has authored a novel for modern times, capturing a subculture of doughy, pimply faced record collectors who live to know who played bass or keys or sang back-up vocals on what session. These are people I know well.<br /><br />Hornby is also a storyteller with prodigious skills. Effortlessly, he spouts smart dialogue, draws colorful and complex characters, paints vivid ambience, and weaves circumstance to draw the reader into another world--a world of yearning, insecurity, and alienation. I can smell the mildew in that used record shop. I can feel the ambivalent heartache of losing a girl you're not quite sure was the right one, yet can't let go of. I am in awe of this author and this book. I only wish the movie had come within a light year of the novel.<br /><br />Rand Bishop, author Makin' Stuff Up, The Absolute Essentials of Songwriting Success, and Grand Pop.

0374532125|4.0|Dead Aid by Dambisa Moyo has created attention in Norway, being one of the few countries that gives more than 1% of BNP, and a major part of it to Africa.   Corruption has been a major problem and even officials working in the government department handling foreign aid,  have been wondering how much monetary as well as other forms of aid, such as roadbuilding projects have really  been of help commensurate with the billions of Kroners that has been given in aid over the last 20-30 years.  Dambisa Moyo has shown other ways of looking at aid and suggested other ways Africa can move forward.    She seems particularly impressed with the chinese way, even if the chinese also helps themselves to raw material and oil.   The statistics she presents on the scale of aid to Africa and the scale of subsidies to US cotton famers and do.  to cotton farmers elsewhere, as well as agricultural subsidies in the USA and EU compared to aid makes  surprising reading.

B0033TJATW|5.0|I had this on VHS, bought it when my kids were little.(early '90's)they watched it at least once a week. By the time they were in high school the tape got loaned to someone and never returned. I've waited forever for it to be released on DVD and thought after Michael died it would be released right away, but no. So when Amazon emailed me and said I could get this one I was worried that a DVD released overseas might not be exactly the same. Shouldn't have worried. IT'S GREAT!! My 23 year old son and I watched it and he kept saying how he remembered watching this when he was about 6. Don't be afraid to buy this, it's Moonwalker just like you remember.

B0035J6TAI|5.0|I have been a Peter Gabriel fan since 1974, and had not previously heard most of the songs on this album by their original artists.   After two or three listens, I found that I really enjoy almost all of the tracks.  Many reviewers have stated that PG's versions do not stand out above the orginals, but I still find them enjoyable.  I like the orchestral arrangements also.  I bought the CD to complete my collection, but will keep listening to it because I like it very much.
B00005QGAV|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />For the most part, the songs that comprise \\"Dangerous\\" represent Michael Jackson as a master musical personality and artist at the top of his craft.  There are a couple of songs which feel like ragged filler, and a bombshell was about to drop that would change Mr. Jackson's cultural profile forever, but here is his last truly great album.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the wonderful \\"Jam,\\" a five-and-a-half minute mini-epic which at the time seemingly declared that Michael Jackson would be a major player in the popular sound of the 1990's, just as he was throughout the 1980's.  \\"Why You Wanna Trip On Me?\\" manages to be both catchy and trite, and \\"In The Closet\\" features a great chorus that saves the song from complete mediocrity.  Genuinely great songs from this album include \\"Black or White,\\" \\"Give In To Me,\\" \\"Remember The Time,\\" \\"Heal The World,\\" and \\"Will You Be There?\\", also featured in the 1993 movie \\"Free Willy.\\"<br /><br />This is the last truly great CD from Michael Jackson. Pick this up either for nostalgic reasons or if you are curious for a peek at the true talent that generations of pop music lovers continue to applaud.
B000009PNY|3.0|3.5 stars:  unlike many here, I wasn't particularly taken by the covers by God Lives Underwater, The Cure, The Smashing Pumpkins -- they're all fine versions, and bear the distinctive influence of the group doing the cover, but they didn't really add a whole lot either.  (E.g. I'm a huge fan of The Cure in addition to DM, but the cover doesn't capture the strengths of either band.)  At least it's much better than the many tribute albums that just leave me wondering why I'm not listening to the originals!    My personal favorite is Self's \\"Shame\\" [a great update with great background sounds], along with: Rabbit in the Moon's \\"Waiting for the Night\\", Rammstein's \\"Stripped\\" and Veruca Salt's \\"Somebody\\".    Other strong tracks are Meat Beat Manifesto's \\"Everything Counts\\", Hooverphonic's \\"Shake the Disease\\", and Locust's \\"Master and Servant\\".    My suggestion/summary: listen to (in order)    #10, #12, #16, #6; #7, #8, #9  and if you like those, it's worth buying the used disc album for $6.
B0011NVC98|3.0|When I was but a callow freshman my mother, an archetypal Danish monster*, meaning well, made me sign up for a Mediaeval English Literature class. At the time this aggrieved me, but despite myself I enjoyed it immensely, and especially the really old bits - derived from Icelandic and Old High German, prominent among them [[ASIN:0140447555 Snorri Sturluson's sagas]]  in which people ritually burn each other and the anonymous Danish legend [[ASIN:0393320979 Beowulf]]. It's a great story, even in its [[ASIN:0451527402 original old English]] (which considerably pre-Chaucer, so tough if you have trouble navigating the vowel shift), and - being the archetypal \\"confronting the Monster\\" story - ideal fodder, you would think, for a cinematic treatment.<br /><br />And in recent times, it has had more than its fair share. Derek Jacobi and Ralph Fiennes have narrated a 30 minute animated version; Gerard Butler and a bunch of Canadians endured gales and abysmal weather in Iceland to make an earnest and frugal but, in truth, [[ASIN:B000GIXEIG not especially imaginative version]] in 2005. And there's this one.<br /><br />Well, you certainly couldn't mark this one down for not being imaginative. First the positives: the cast, as announced, is astounding, numbering amongst them Anthony Hopkins (Hrothgar), Ray Winstone (Beowulf), John Malkovich (some other guy) and Angelina Jolie as Grendel's Mother. Yes: you read that right: Brad Pitt's wife (as she then was) plays one of the most famous monsters in the history of literature. Short of a  [[ASIN:B00005JMUK Charlize Theron turn as an Eileen Wurnos]] type character, that has to be one of the most extraordinary pieces of miscasting since they put Keanu Reeves in [[ASIN:B0000714BZ Much Ado About Nothing]].<br /><br />Unless, of course, the film-makers have been so imaginative that they've completely re-imagined the part of Grendel's mother. I hope it won't be considered poor sport of me to let on that they have.<br /><br />And the script is witty and the screenplay and staging - while frequently indulging in 3D effects for the hell of it, as 3D movies tend to do - is impressive. Grendel (junior) is well rendered and achieves surprising empathy for an entirely digital performance. I think he also speaks in Old High German, and is portrayed not as merriment-resenting curmudgeon (as in the original) but as having a very nasty ear infection!<br /><br />Now the negatives. Beowulf is designed as an onscreen rendering of a graphic novel (in old fashioned lingo, a comic), so do not come to this expecting a faithful or reverent iteration of the film. The plot has been significantly revised, although for the most part thoughtfully and cleverly, albeit conducted at breakneck speed, and with lashings of gore. Then again, it would be difficult to depict as much dismembering the story requires (even in its original state) without a fair bit of splatter.<br /><br />But the biggest thing to note is that (being produced by the [[ASIN:B000AGTPUU Polar Express]] team) Beowulf is entirely digital - not just acted in front of blue screens, but fully animated, like [[ASIN:B00009ZYC1 Shrek]]; the actors have been completely re-rendered. In some cases this works well (Hrothgar): I dare say portly cockney geezer Ray Winstone was absolutely chuffed to be presented as a 6 foot 5 inches of rippling Geatish hunk; but the remainder of the characters do have an unfortunate Shrek-ish sort of bearing and their movements aren't especially convincing (particularly the horses, which all look rather stumpy and ponyish). Ultimately I found this immensely distracting to the point where it spoiled what otherwise would have been a tremendous film.<br /><br />There's a place for the technical wizardry, as Peter Jackson has ably demonstrated; but when it becomes the principal point of the film something is bound to have been lost.<br /><br />Olly Buxton<br /><br />*Joking about my mum being a Danish monster.

B00328G4V6|5.0|As a long time Hendrix fan I must admit I didn't expect much from this \\"new\\" release assuming I had pretty much heard it all, but this material is pretty amazing, and for a longtime fan it's like manna from heaven! The title track cleaned up well from the previous version I have on the \\"Lifelines\\" box set. Much of the material sounds like it was recorded yesterday. I appreciate what the Hendrix people have done to get his amazing music out there without a bunch of B.S. The new 2010 remaster of \\"First Rays\\" sounds incredible too. Can't wait to hear what Jimi does next!

Very easy to read. Highly recommended.
B0035J6TA8|4.0|i'm a huge fan. i love that man.     i waited eight long years for this record, as i always do.    he's really just phoning it in here, having not done the arranging much himself even.    i really wish this was a proper covers record of songs reinterpreted in the style of peter gabriel as we know and love him, and not just stripped down, orchestral arrangements seeming to only serve to highlight some admittedly great lyrics. i just get the feeling this was the easiest way to satisfy the release quota, adding to it the gimmick of the promised companion record where these artists are now meant to cover gabriel tunes in return. it's a great idea, and i can't wait to hear some of those interpretations, but that doesn't leave me with another great gabriel record. instead, i have what amounts to something like an album-length version of \\"here comes the flood.\\"    don't get me wrong, this is about the best record of the year so far, and i do recommend it to anyone who likes a little beautiful music. i just probably won't be wearing out my copy in my car as i have all other gabriel records since \\"melt.\\"    since i buy all formats of anything gabriel, let me also add that one should not expect any more \\"teeth\\" from the remixes on the deluxe edition. they are very similar to the originals, in fact their differences would probably go unnoticed to anyone not actually looking for them. still, i prefer them (maybe just because i feel like i'm getting something more for my money) and the bonus disc also includes gabriel's rendition of \\"waterloo sunset,\\" by the kinks. i'm a bit sad that this one is not on the basic record, because i'd be most interested in what ray davies might do with a peter gabriel song. maybe he'll do one anyway.    so that's it. i'm so sad to report there's a peter gabriel record i'm not in love with, but i guess there had to be one sometime.
0307454541|4.0|Everyone thinks old Henrick Vanger is off his rocker when he hires disgraced financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist, to find his niece's killer. Harriett Vanger has been missing for nearly forty years and Henrick has never stopped wondering what happened to her. Blomkvist goes to Henrick's estate and takes a hiatus from his troubled magazine promising to stay on for one year to look into Harriett's dissapearance.<br /><br />Blomkvist teams up with hacker extraodinaire and research assistant, Lisbeth Salander. Together they unearth a series of grisly murders that have a biblical theme. They begin to believe it's possible that Harriett knew the identity of the killer and was in fear for her life on the day she took missing.<br /><br />Told with a welcoming, smooth narrative, this mystery will have you turning the pages as you search with Salander and Blomkvist for the killer. The crimes they uncover are truly horrific.<br /><br />There is a lot of sex and truly grisly crimes in this book so if you don't like that kind of content, this book won't be for you. It is however, a good Swedish mystery. I liked the characters and thought Steig Larson had many good characters and mysterious twists in this first book of the trilogy.

B002MU4NL8|4.0|Disclosure: I am a Trekkie. Dyed-in-the-wool, through and through. So I approach this film from that perspective.<br /><br />The movie:<br /><br />\\"Galaxy Quest\\" does the impossible - it makes me enjoy something with Tim Allen in it. I place this movie in that rarefied category of \\"spoof movies that are equally entertaining as spoofs and as stand-alones.\\" By this, I mean that you could never have watched an episode of Star Trek (shame on you!) and still enjoy this as a science fiction movie. Other films in this category include \\"Hot Fuzz\\" (Buddy Cop pics) and \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" (Zombie flicks). We are given a plot revolving around the cast of a Star Trek-like show, a few decades after their run on TV. They are stuck in a dreary cycle of conventions and appearances cashing in on their previous fame. Then, something strange happens: real aliens approach them, asking them for their help in an interstellar war.<br /><br />What is especially surprising is how emotional this movie made me. I think its loving depiction of fan devotion, mixed with the somewhat sad portrayal of middle-aged actors who are bitter over typecasting, really hit home for me. The happy ending was made all the more affecting. I was pretty much ready to check my brain and critical eye at the door by the time this movie was finished, however formulaic the resolution might be, objectively speaking.<br /><br />The cast is very good and the humor is dead-on target. Allen is perfectly cast as a self-important blowhard with an undercurrent of insecurity. Sigourney Weaver is also a standout, demonstrating fine comic timing. The alien characters are charming and quirky. The effects are also surprisingly good, equal to some of the later Star Trek films!<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />The 1080p image presented on this disc is a definite uprade from the SD DVD, but it isn't exactly a \\"beat you over the head\\" HD image. It shows a bit of softness and a bit of Digital Noise Reduction (DNR). The movie was filmed in 1999, and this does look better than some images of that vintage (\\"Dark City\\" springs to mind as a DNR'ed mess from about the same year). It's just not a spectacular transfer, at the quality level of, say, 1999's \\"Fight Club.\\" That said, the faces do not have the waxy look of the worst DNR, and certain shots show nice detail, especially in cloth. The effects shots also look very nice. The print is pretty clean, too. It's just somewhat evident that there was no major restoration work.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 channel mix that does a fine job. Dialogue is never overpowered, and some of the battles and explosions contain booming bass and rear channel surround information. Most of the track is pretty front-loaded, however.<br /><br />Extras include about an hour and 15 minutes worth of documentary features. The most interesting are a feature on the ILM effects (which were pretty good), as well as features on casting, production, and the like. Unfortunately, all the features are in SD. Only the included movie trailer is in HD. 12 minutes of deleted scenes round out the extras.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is great family-friendly entertainment. At the inexpensive Blu-Ray price, if you don't own it, and you love either Star Trek or Sci-Fi in general, you really can't go wrong. It would have been nice to have had a fancier set and a slightly better transfer, but even with its SD features, this is better than most bare-bones releases of \\"less successful\\" movies.<br /><br />I see this as a \\"love letter\\" of sorts to both Trekkies and the Trek cast and crew.

B000EHRVP6|5.0|If your rating this low you can say it is because you do not like the movie, but the truth is you just can not handle violence in a movie that is not completely toned down to try to make a little more at the box office. For these people I would recommend you stick to movies that have been using the same plots over and over from the 80's \\"anything by Tyler Perry or the new chic-flic\\". If you like movies based on the meaner side of reality that do not shy away from violence, then you will definitely enjoy Hostel.

I waited until after reading the book to watch Choke and I am glad that I did.  Not that the movie strayed from the book - it stayed true to the story- but because there is so much more to the book.<br /><br />The story is completely original and the characters completely believable. The language is raw as is the subject matter.  But the real surprise is the ending.  I was totally unprepared for how the story would end and completely satisfied once I had 'turned' the last page (Kindle edition).<br /><br />I am going to try a couple more of Mr Palahniuks book and see what happens!

The combo sets sold out very quickly though so I held off.  I finally got my BluRay player and one of the first BD movies I bought was this (the movie is very dark and makes BD totally worth it on my Sony XBR).  I opened it and low an behold, it comes with the DVD of the movie too, even though I don't really need  it now.  Why isn't this feature advertised clearly????

B001PPLIEG|5.0|The latest Bond is more of a throwback to the Connery days than was its predecessor, \\"Casino Royale\\".  Though the 2008 film is not as long as most JB films - running under two hours - and it does bear a striking resemblance in the action scenes to the Matt Damon \\"Bourne\\" films, it still has a few elements that make it a definite continuation of the series that began almost five decades ago.<br /><br />Like any good Bond film, there is the menace (Mathieu Amalric) with the villainous plan up his sleeve, the despot from a foreign country (Joaquin Cosio), the cool car, the hot women (Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Artherton), and the splashy destruction of the bad guy's lair near the film's end.  Though the \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is not clearly understood, there's enough of the good to outweigh that aspect of the story line.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is continuing to carve a unique characterization of the Ian Fleming creation, adding equal parts of menace and vulnerability.  His tough-as-nails demeanor still masks a man with a lot of BONDage carrying around, especially after the death of his beloved Vesper.<br /><br />Judi Dench is still commanding and perfect as \\"M\\" and Jeffrey Wright is again underused as Felix Leiter.  Maybe in the next film, he'll have more than a \\"cameo\\".
B0030BYWKU|3.0|When I first saw Jason Desrouleax (he changed the spelling of his name to make it more pronounceable), I dubbed him Chris Brown, Jr. Then when \\"Whatcha Say\\" became a #1 hit, I figured it was only because people didn't realize the chorus is built upon a sample that urban audiences aren't familiar with (in this case, Imogen Heap's \\"Hide and Seek\\"). But \\"Whatcha Say\\" isn't a bad song or anything; even so, you'd think his label wouldn't wait almost a full year to release his self-titled debut album (especially since it only has nine songs on it).<br /><br />There are other good songs on here, like \\"Love Hangover\\", \\"Fallen\\" and \\"The Sky's the Limit\\". But the album might not quite be accessible to everyone because Jason has the kind of voice that sounds like he's using auto-tune, but he isn't. This makes a few of the songs sound the same after a while -- in fact, the only song that really breaks things up is the final one, \\"Blind\\". All in all, though, Jason's album is still worth checking out.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

This collection is very solid & perhaps a very good place to start, but I recommend getting the deluxe editions of \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" & \\"Rumours\\", then moving to the deluxe \\"Tusk\\" - now that they are available.  I say this specifically because the compilers choose specific versions of some of their key songs & I believe they chose the lesser mix in several cases. With the deluxe editions, you can compare for yourself.  Diving deeper into Lindsey Buckingham's creativity is worth the investment!

0439023483|5.0|When I started reading the first few pages of this book I was like, this book is ok nothing really good about it, but as I read more and more of it, I just couldn't put  it down! The Hunger Games has action, adventure, romance, and some violence in it. It was really intriguing! There were lots of times where I didn't know some events were going to happen, then all of a sudden it just surprised me. I also like how Suzanne Collins always leaves you thinking, What's going to happen next? Every time I finished a chapter, thats what I was always wondering, which made me want to read more.     I love the author's writing style, she's always so descriptive in the characters and places, that I didn't have to question what the people or the places looked liked. It felt like I was in the book too, experiencing all the things that happened to the teenagers, I loved it! This book isn't slow or dragging, there is always something happening which kept me entertained the whole time. This is probably the best book that I've ever read and I'm glad that there  are two other books in the series.    The story is mostly about 24 teenagers that have to compete against each other and have to fight to the finish. I think that's kind of scary because you never know when someone's going to come up and kill you. So you have to kill everyone, but also be the last one to survive The Hunger Games.    So overall I would highly recommend this book to young adults or older just because there might be some gruesome things that happen. I cannot wait to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay!
1428166556|3.0|My many observations of \\"The Black Swan\\" do not fall into a Gaussian distribution. Sure, there are some strongly positive and some strongly negative and no doubt some clustered around some average, but the result would not be a bell curve.     In his key points, Taleb repeatedly makes strong arguments, supported by being generally correct. Who can argue with the evidence of the past few years and the financial meltdown driven by \\"black swan events\\" that were way outside the models of the \\"experts\\"? His timing was excellent. He is also on very solid ground in complaints about the narrative fallacies of ex post facto explanations and the \\"ludic fallacy\\". A recent example of such hubris was the special election after Ted Kennedy died. When Scott Brown won, the media were full of reasons why it happened and what it meant, and then offered forward extrapolations and predictions. I nodded in full agreement about the asymmetry of human claims for randomness in a negative direction and natural skill or influence on the upside.    Some of my objections were:    * Taleb overdoes the Gaussian pummeling. Perhaps I underestimate the commonality of analyses based on Gaussian curves, but I wasn't aware that many people actually claimed that financial markets and so many other things followed that model. This teetered a bit too much toward a strawman for my taste, although I must admit that in my own industry (software), the \\"six sigma\\" idea strikes me as a joke, as if there weren't clusters and dependencies and all kinds of complications with respect to defect rates.    * The cracks about various professions and people who just \\"don't get it\\" were either extremely arrogant or rather juvenile in their repetitiveness and tone, interfering with letting the material and more professional arguments carry the day. This, and the constant focus on himself and personal anecdotes, knocked off a star for sure. I understand the author was trying to liven up technical material with a personaltwist, as a textbook would have gone nowhere. Nevertheless, the listening was not that pleasant.    * He overstates the black-swan nature of some technical and scientific breakthroughs that were greatly aided by years of solid research and predictions and were not a tremendously great surprise to those involved (as opposed to the general public).     I suggest readers consider Gregg Easterbrook's review in the New York Times and Mr. Taleb's response, both entertaining and a capsule of some commentary.      The narrator of the audio book was average, not with the smooth tones of many readers. I have no idea what Mr. Taleb sounds like, and presumably the narrator captured the earnest argument and arrogance conveyed by the words.

0385510438|5.0|The year is 1970, and callow college dropout Will Traynor, with six months of journalism experience, buys the local newspaper in Clanton, Mississippi. The business is moribund until a woman is raped and murdered, handing Will the opportunity to triple its circulation overnight. What follows is the story of the trial and its aftermath ten years later, when murderer is paroled. Along the way, Will, who has morphed into \\"Willie\\", makes some good friends and some colorful ones, learns about and finds gradual acceptance in town, and chronicles the changes that rock the Clanton's foundations:  the decade ushers in racial integration,  the residents face up to the outlaw Padgitt clan, big box retailers change the face of Main Street, and the controversy over Viet Nam grows ever hotter.<br /><br />The plot of the Last Juror evolves slowly, although the intermittent violence that erupts prevents the development of ennui.  This novel's strength lies in its  characters, particularly those of Will and Miss Callie, who comes to serve as a moral beacon in the young man's life. But all of the characters ring true, from the shady lawyer to the newspaper's redneck photographer. Grisham has become a master at evoking the atmosphere of the deep South, and a sense of nostalgia pervades throughout. But this is a story of change, its central issues revolving around questions of integrity and honor.  It opens and closes with the writing of obituaries, but the Will who is writing the last one has come a long way. So has Clanton.<br /><br />Memorable, and highly recommended.

B002EC3932|4.0|\\"Historicity\\" is Vijay Iyer's trio album, and it got excellent reviews throughout 2009.  I think it's as good as everyone says.  The songs are in his signature style, which is sort of an Indian-American cousin of Matthew Shipp or Ethan Iverson.  His style is somewhat muted since only four of ten songs are originals by Iyer.  Some of Andrew Hill peeks out in \\"Smoke Stack\\", for instance, and the excellent \\"Galang\\" is a recasting of the song but still recognizeable as a pop song.  Longtime cohorts Stephen Crump on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums keep the rhythms tight.  I suppose only my preference for horns or guitar as the frontline instrument keeps me from giving it five stars.  If I could, I'd give this 4 3/4 stars.

The world has quite 'modern' sensibilities in everything form gender roles to medicine and the disappearance of regional dialects. As well, it can sometimes be a bit 'meta': Kvothe oft proclaims that 'things don't happen like they do in stories'. Finally, because it's the first person narrative of somebody who travels a lot and is frequently on his own: very few of the other characters are explored to any great depth at all.<br /><br />However, the world is well developed, the internal logic of the fantasy elements consistent and intriguing, and the dialogue natural and flowing. What struck me most, however, was the books lyricism: more than just the ability to turn a phrase, the occasional examples of poetry and song throughout the book are remarkably well done and contribute greatly to the feeling that this is an established world with its own history.
B00328G4V6|3.0|As a collector of all things Jimi, I really didn't expect much from this & that's pretty much what I got.     To me it's basically an \\"Eddie Kramer Labor of Love\\" (which isn't that bad), but there's so much more sitting in the vaults to be heard!    I have proof from many bootlegs (as many others do.) I couldn't even start to list the recordings never heard by most & much better.    ON HERE: Lullaby For The Summer.... Is maybe the only real saving grace, but no great shakes compared to the yet unreleased really.    Wait for the rest... If you can live that long!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|Awseome, as usual.One of the best singer songwriters of our time, and this is a collection of her greatest hits plus a couple of new tracks....
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Movie - 4.5    I've always appreciated the kind of grit and quirky comradery Guy Ritchie writes into his films, but all his previous efforts have been gangster titles. Here we have something different -- a detective story. And I think doing a Sherlock movie was a great choice because of two things: 1) Ritchie infusing his unique style into the film, and 2) Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's creation of Holmes, which resulted in the creation of Gregory House, which looks to have resulted in the re-recreation of Sherlock Holmes via Guy Ritchie. Aesthetically and literally, Holmes isn't anything new. It has elements of action, comedy, drama, thriller, and mystery, but what really catches me is the relationship between Holmes and Watson. For any of you who watch House M.D., I'm sure you know of the relationship House has with Wilson. The parallels between obsession and perfection in one's craft, the possession of sheer brilliance, the tough exterior with a fragile interior, and quirky intimacy between oneself and a good friend (or in this case, \\"bromance\\") is a combination of attributes I've really come to appreciate the past few years I've been watching House and now noticing in Holmes. I stopped paying attention to Downey Jr. during his rut of bad boy and alcohol days. But after seeing him in some great roles lately, namely from: Iron Man, Tropic Thunder, The Soloist, and Zodiac, he's starting to become one of my favorite actors. Jude Law (as obsessed as Seth Rogen appears to be with him) also does a great job as Watson. Like Wilson is to House, Watson compliments Holmes and gives him that down-to-earth quality required to make the movie as enjoyable as it is. Ritchie ultimately manages to input that time in spurts, though, giving just enough interaction to make it fun when it's there, but not too much to take away from the plot. Ah, and the sequel. While Mark Strong (whom I'm slightly obsessed with myself after seeing his performance in Body of Lies), plays an admirable villain as Lord Blackwood, the prospect of Moriarty in the next movie is something I really look forward to. If Ritchie can maintain the quirkiness and carry it into the battle of wits and intellect that accompany the rivalry of Moriarty, this may turn into a definite all-time favorite series for me. So here's hoping to that.    Video - 4.0    Because of the art direction and distinct photography, Holmes' video quality is a bit of a mixed bag. The monochromatic color palette gives the film a very Victorian feel, but doesn't amount to much vibrancy aside from Adler's pink dress when her character is introduced. There's a lot of grey, black, and dark blue used in the costuming, and while it's a good reflection of the period itself, I wouldn't say it's a bad transfer necessarily. It's just not the kind of video quality that will wow Blu-ray viewers. With that said, there are also a few instances of crush, bleeding, and inconsistent contrast levels when all the dark clothing kind of blends into itself a little too much. On the other hand, detail is fine, fleshtones are accurate (albeit, a little on the pale side), black levels are deep, and there isn't a whole lot of digital noise or any image manipulation to speak of. It's a very good transfer that reflects the period well, but as a presentation on BD isn't anything spectacular.    Audio - 5.0    The overall design makes for some great immersion both in sound effects and music. Hans Zimmer's score is well-balanced and never overwhelms, complimenting the fun and adventurous mood very nicely. Dialogue is clear and focused in the center channel, though you may want to watch the film with subs until you get used to Downey's accent. Dynamic range is excellent as well, most notably in the slaughterhouse scene where Blackwood's voice is circling the entire sound field. And LFEs are booming during flashback, epiphany, and \\"Holmes-o-vision\\" cuts and especially in the shipyard scene. Considering the scope of the plot and the fact thatit's a Sherlock Holmes movie, I give a lot of credit to Ritchie and the film's sound team for creating a very cool experience.    Extras - 4.0    While I own Watchmen and Terminator Salvation as well, Holmes is actually the first chance I've had time to try and watch Warner Bros. Maximum Movie Mode, and I have to say it's pretty cool. Guy Ritchie does an excellent job explaining his intentions and a lot of the technical jargon that accompanied the filming process (in a nice suit to boot). There are also cuts and splices of the Focus Points and \\"Reinventing Holmes\\" feature as well that flow very well with MMM. My only complaint, though, is that the FP and RH features tend to rehash a lot of what was already said in MMM, and I was a little disappointed in the amount of dead space during the feature as well. But nonetheless, it still makes for a very engaging and informative experience that beats most regular commentaries.    Overall 4.5    I'm happy that they picked Guy Ritchie to give the franchise of Sherlock Holmes a new and contemporary look. It's as gritty and quirky as lot of his other hits and is probably the funnest of his films I've seen thus far, thanks in huge part to the character/actor chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. A sequel is inevitable at this point, but I personally hope they turn it into a possible trilogy. The video is good, but not great, the audio is reference, and the Maximum Movie Mode shows a lot of potential for future big-name titles. If you like Ritchie or House M.D., I highly recommend you give this a watch.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|When I first heard about this collaboration, I couldn't really picture how they'd pull it off. Being a huge Queen fan,I nervously awaited their 2006 tour, and was pleasantly suprised -they sounded great from 2nd row.They did absolutely no disrespect to Freddie, and for Bohemian Rhapsody (his signature song),he re-joined the band via recorded footage on the big screens. Paul didn't even try to touch it, nor \\"Love of My Life\\" for that matter.I remember thinking \\"wow, Freddie would be proud that 2 of his bandmates are again selling out concerts and still honouring his presence,in a respectful manner\\". In many ways, it felt like a tribute to Freddie, 15 years after his passing.    I really encourage the listener to hear this w/o expectations - no one can replace Freddie, and Paul's not trying to. He sounds like himself with half of Queen.Rather than review the songs, which has already been done by others, I'll just give my overall opinion.  Honestly, this CD does have some cheesy parts (like \\"C-Lebrity\\" and \\"Schools Out\\"). But songs like \\"Small\\", \\"Through the Night\\", and \\"Some Things That Glitter\\" send chills down my spine. Brian's guitar work and Paul's  vocals really work well together, and \\"Voodoo\\" is a rather seductive song, sure to be a classic. Overall it's an uplifting CD, an amazing feat considering the undue expectations of some of the fans.    It does at times sound like Bad Co, Queen, and Brian May solo works were cut and pasted together, with Paul's influence being the heaviest. His swaggering melodies and soulful voice tend to dominate the music, as if the music was written around his lyrics. Maybe this is their extra effort at sounding like the non-Freddie Queen, or maybe it's just Paul's presence.      Overall there is good chemistry on this CD, and at times it sounds like they're just friends cuttin' up (like \\"Cosmos\\" and \\"Call Me\\"). I really believe (and hope) that if they put out another CD, it will be more cohesive, after they've had time to gel as aband while touring with these new songs. If they were to change their name, it would take off some pressure of expectations, but regardless - this is a whole new band and not the original Queen. Just listen for yourself, without prejudice.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I have been doing A LOT of research trying to find a stupid pair of headphones for my PS3 so I can play as loud as I want and not have to hear my wife saying \\"does that have to be THAT LOUD??\\" The problem being the great ones cost waaaaay to much money (which I am not opposed to paying for quality but for a gaming system...I have a high-fi set up for movies and payed big money for that) Anyway, I am just saying if you have been researching headphones you know by know how frustrating it is trying to figure out which one to get based on these reviews you read online.  I mean if you are like me, hearing them in use is the key to buying a set of headphones/speakers/ whatever audio piece you are buying.  You don't buy a car online without driving one first.  So at a price point of $79.99 I was willing to give these a try as they were designed for the PS3 as well as the Xbox and PC.  Few comments from the get-go:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Excellent design on ear cups (generous padding) and size of head strap (I have a huge melon and these fit with room to spare)<br />2) Super long cord<br />3) Very nice multi-directional sound for non 5.1 surround headphones<br />4) Very rich sound for games/movies/music.<br />5) Excellent volume control on headsets controls<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Belt clip is SUPER weak...broke 3rd day I owned them..doesn't matter to me..I wasn't even using that feature (and yet it still broke, I think I leaned on it in my chair..jeez)<br />2) I do hear the \\"hiss\\" people were talking about but it was only during the dead silence waiting for the games to load...it is not noticeable in games AT ALL. Remember this is right over your ear, you are going to hear something (least at this price point)<br />3) Bass Boost is a joke..there is not any huge sound improvement using this feature.<br /><br />I have not tried the headphone mic yet in MW2 yet so I may update this when I do but the setup in my Ps3 was easy and it saw the headphones no problem. I am interested to see how it mixes the two sounds (game/voice).
B002E01MI8|4.0|This Blu-Ray looks great for a 30 year old exploitation film. New York City circa 1980 was never looked sleazier and Blue Underground's transfer looks great. The video looks like a 35mm print, complete with a bit of grain and lots of detail. In other words, it's near perfect for what it is.....<br />The extras are minor but a nice addition.<br /><br />The film....love it, hate it, laugh at it....Personally, I feel it's Fulci goofing on Dario Argento. Argento's films have pretty lighting and make murder look artistic. With \\"New York Ripper\\" Fulci serves up sleazy characters, gaudy lighting and makes violence look gruesome and horrible. There's also the quacking, Donald Duck-voiced killer, another poke at giallo convention that typically has a raspy voiced killer making threatening phone calls.<br /><br />It's 2nd tier Fulci, but definitely worth a look if you have the stomach for it or are a fan of Euro-cult and exploitation films.
B002OB9KPE|2.0|Well you could also add another star in the evaluation, by avoiding the derivative moments and the lack of inspiration too (sometimes hidden by means of a couple of famous covers). But if you regard instead such a good Roine's performance (actually not completely original), as well as a bunch of remarkable and non- unforgettable melodies, you could change idea...of course in my opinion a modern prog album should be characterized by many different creative features (without forgetting the past, as in the early Echolyn albums or in the modern ensemble of After Crying, like within \\"6\\"), that here you cannot find...moreover the presence of N. Morse and his \\"Christian\\" lyrics once again, make the present work quite similar to his solo works.  Naturally such a personal opinion is not affected by the music background of each band member, but at the end the artistic creativity is more important than the skill of each musician; and here, above all within side 2, these elements are not present!! Then you can appreciate the length of the suite, sometimes a bit boring, even though the modern mix as well as a good production, make improve the general quality level of the work...so the album could be worth checking out at least, but now we are in 2010 and it could be so important to look ahead and towards a different music scene in the future too...but you have to make your own choice, as usual!!
B0036JU6CY|2.0|Concept from trailer seemed like fun, but the execution was poor.  Some Kung Fu scenes were OK, but the plot and acting were terrible.
B002GU5V24|3.0|As usual their live recordings- regarding the most famous symphonic prog band (afterwards most popular poppy/pop rock band of the Collins Era)- are not up to the task linked to their fame.  Moreover (even though most of \\"Selling England By The Pound\\"- at the time of its release- is present here!), there's not a good job concerning the re-master of \\"Second's Out\\" and- in particular- between track 1 and 2, where unfortunately you can listen to some evident defects inside and random noise within, probably due to an unperfect cleaning of the original tape...so at this point it's better listening to the remastered version of their double album \\"Second's Out\\", rather than the present one, but nevermind...the concert performed at Rainbow Theatre (dated 1973) was an important gig and in general, the new re-master has improved all their recordings within the box set (taken from various concerts, including one of their most celebrated ones, which was performed in Paris), also regarding of a simple 2 channel version in the place of a multi-channel method in 5.1. Talking about \\"Three Sides Live\\" I don't want to add anything else.. I don't like neither that period nor the approach emerging from their modern live gigs, which is too much easy in my opinion...but probably each fan of their old Era- obviously- keep on prefering the theatrical approach of the most important romantic prog band ever (not necessarily the best one..).    Make your own choice as usual, even though in my opinion Genesis (except on the original Second's Out) don't show the best side of themselves in their \\"normal\\" live performances!!    Good, but non- essential...
B00005NTNM|3.0|This is a real routine entry in the franchise.  Clint seems to be sleepwalking his way through this one.  Probably exhausted himself after starring and directing \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\" the same year.  The flick lacks the urgency of the original \\"Dirty Harry\\" or the sylishness of \\"Magnum Force\\".  This is not to say it's a bad flick.  It's an average one that reasonably holds your attention.  It just feels rushed and almost a cynical attempt to cash in on the success of the previous entries in the series.  A disappointment when you consider the calibre of Eastwood's previous and subsequent work behind and in front of the camera.
B002ZG977Y|5.0|\\"Clash Of The Titans\\" is great! This is how the story goes: The ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods. But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. Born of a god but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from Hades, vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, Perseus volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus and unleash hell on earth. Leading a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will only survive if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.

This is a great action film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. Sam Worthington is on a roll with the films he is doing. This is just as fun as \\"300\\" (2007) or \\"Troy\\" (2004).
630471193X|5.0|Fine actors in very good roles.  John Travolta and Kyra Sedgwick: between the two they could wring a tear from a stone.  Get it and watch it, it'll take the edges off your edges.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Overall I thought this was a good film.  The cinematography was dark and gritty and gave a perceived notion of London during the time period.  The characters were nicely portrayed as well and their clothes and costumes reflected the time period well.  Authenticity was definitely there.  The music was fitting although at times I didn't seem to notice it as it was mostly instrumental.<br /><br />The casting was done appropriately.  Robert Downey Jr plays Sherlock Holmes with his faithful sidekick Watson (Jude Law).  I did however think that Watson was a much more engaging and interesting character than Holmes in this.  While Holmes had plenty of quirks and eccentricities, Watson had more connect-ability and personality.  Other characters included Mark Strong, who plays Lord Blackwood.  He does a great job and makes for a formidable enemy, although for some reason his teeth really bothered me (but that could be my own quirk). Rachael McAdams plays Irene Adler, Holmes on and off again lady love who has foiled him numerous times.  There are other characters, but they don't play as strong of a role in the film.<br /><br />The premise starts with Holmes and Watson rushing in to save a girl from ritual sacrifice.  This leads to the capture and subsequent hanging of Lord Blackwood.  Soon it is discovered that by some means, Blackwood has risen from the dead.  It is up to Holmes to find him and stop him in his next plan, a plan that could end up with many people dying.<br /><br />During the course of the movie there are many fight scenes and action adventure type happenings.  However, despite this, the film progresses slowly at parts.  It seems to drag when there is no action happening.<br /><br />Overall I'd say this movie is worth seeing. It has an intriguing plot line (even if it takes forever to get through it) and interesting characters.  Having never read the books I can't say for sure whether or not it follows the stories or stays true to the characters, but on its own it was worthwhile.
0451196716|5.0|I thought this was a great book!  I read long into the night, needed to find out who would \\"make it\\".  Although simple, you begin to 'see' the characters.  One of his good ones and I've read them all.
B000O9K9EY|5.0|If you have not read the Thorn Birds, you have not read a great piece of literature. The TV miniseries is also great!

B0037QGS0A|4.0|Atom Egoyan's new film Chloe tells a story that's been told many times before, the tale of the woman scorned. But the new perspective that Egoyan brings to the erotic thriller genre, that makes it more original and provocative than any film I've seen this year.    Julianne Moore's portrayal of the heroine, Catherine Stewart, is near perfect. Moore has really been at the top of her game lately. In A Single Man, she played a character that she also brought great depth to, despite having only about fifteen minutes of air-time. In Chloe, she plays an upper middle-class gynecologist, who has been married to David (Liam Neeson) for many years. She suspects that he's having an affair, after noticing his flirtacious banter with a waitress, and after missing a flight, and his surprise birthday party. And just like that, her long simmering suspicions rise to the surface.    Finding no answer other than infidelity, she hires an escort, played by Amanda Seyfried, in the title role, to seduce her husband, to see his reaction. She finds herself \\"directing\\" she and her husband's encounters, giving Chloe notes on how to react to certain things that her husband says and does. Ergo, the fireworks start, and needless to say, lies are told and people get hurt.     This is Julianne Moore's best work in years. She has a knack for giving emotionally devastating performances, and she's in top form here. Her ability to say so much with saying so little, never ceases to amaze me. But the true star here is Amanda Seyfried, who gives the performance of her career. Her repertoire includes mostly comedies, like Mean Girls and Mamma Mia, but the amount of dramatic depth that she brings to the table is unbelievable. Playing a complicated character, you never know what her next move is, and it's interesting to see where it goes, ultimately until the earth-shattering conclusion. Seyfried's large, expressive eyes, tell you what her character is going through, and it's another case, where so much is said, when so little is actually spoken. The supporting cast, of course, includes Liam Neeson, who is always excellent, as Catherine's philandering husband, and he essentially does his job. There's not a whole lot of room in this picture, for his character to evolve. More attention is paid to the female leads.    What separates this from the countless stories of mistrust and infidelity, is the eerie and surprisingly profound tone that Egoyan brings to the table. It's a very mature, classy, smart film that deals with trust, loyalty, and love, and how, after so long, love can vanish, and an emotion can take over that you never would have expected to feel. And plus the settings are gorgeous. Jim Lambie, the set decorator of films like Heaven on Earth, and Egoyan's Adoration, brings a modern sense of traditionalism to the look of the film, especially the main setting of the Stewart household. And, also, the score, masterfully composed by Mychael Danna, brings out so much emotion, and tension to the table. Shattering orchestra crescendos, in pivotal scenes, bring more feeling, and intensity to the overall tone of the picture.     But, in the end, it's Egoyan's patient and thoughtful pacing, and an excellent performance by Amanda Seyfried that really stand out. It's a very mature, intricate experience that takes its time with developing each character, and brings a stunning conclusion that sets it apart from other stories of its kind. Its portrayal of lust and erotic desire, and the vulnerability of love, itself, will leave you breathless. Egoyan's use of an elegant, gliding camera, traps his characters against windows and mirrors, to signify how trapped a person can feel in their own life. And Egoyan's ability to never tell a story on one level, and his knack for adding layer, after layer to each character, makes the effect that the film has all the more effective.

B001FB4VXU|4.0|The second season actually improves on the first season of the Big Bang Theory. the setting was simple and bound for success: two nerdy phsycists live in an apartment and one day a pretty blonde girl moves in across the hall. It is a very simple concept but it works. the  cast is wonderful and the comedy is firsl-class. While in the first season Penny did not come across very well, this has been improved a lot as we see that is more and more actively interacting with the main characters. Also the secondary characters such as Raj are given more space. All this makes this series quite special despite the quite traditional setting. Every episode a subject is treated and we get to observe the hilarious effects as the two very difefrents worlds collide. It is one of the funniest and nicest shows around at the moment, together with Chuck.

B00004HYLF|5.0|I have this album on vinyl from years ago. In the mid to late 70s it seemed that all the local stereo shops (back before decent quality sound was widely available in big box stores) this album was one of the standards used for demonstration to show off good systems. I'm not a huge jazz fan but I like Return to Forever and this album was expertly transferred to CD and I'm glad to have it minus the vinyl surface noise.

He actually makes CDSs and CDOs understandable --- something that thousands of bond traders failed to do from 2000 to 2008.  While cable TV news talking heads, Wall Street spin doctors, and politicians (in Congress, the Administration [including Treasury], and the Fed!) are chattering around the edges of the issue, Lewis clearly and concisely goes to the root causes.  The talking heads and politicos want us to believe that chest pain causes heart attacks while Lewis explains plaques.  Brilliantly done, again.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|As someone who has been familiar with the original story of Hachiko and has visited the Statue at Shibuya station, I didn't know what to expect when I found this video at a rental location and saw the American actors on the front.  I assumed the worst.. that Hollywood had created some frankenstein version of the tale.     What I found however, was a powerful, clean, affectionate and heartwarming tale of true love and devotion.     This is a must see for all families.
0823003035|3.0|First, I must qualify myself by saying that I have been drawing seriously for about the last year and a half. I am not enrolled in any school or course of study (so I have had many deficiencies and made a lot of mistakes!). Second, I have been using a handful of books on drawing. Third, I have not read this book completely yet so these are my first impressions. Fourth, my three star rating is consequently a tentative one that will probably be revisited.      Having read enough of the posts regarding art/drawing books on Amazon I am very skeptical about any book claiming to be \\"complete\\" , \\"comprehensive\\", \\"definitive\\". Don't know if the \\"hype\\" is driven by the artists' ego or the publisher. Not a big point but nothing wrong with a healthy skepticism.       On the positive side, I have learned more about the specific \\"block in\\" that this artist uses in comparison to a book like Aristides's \\"Classical Atelier Drawing\\" which is very sparse in detail on that particular subject. As a matter of fact , most of my other books have scant information on exactly how one goes about \\"blocking in\\" (or whatever other terminology they use). So it has helped enlighten me on some points.       Where I see some major differences however are in regards to the \\"classical tradition\\". I wish the author could elaborate more on the \\"classical tradition\\" and where he differs from it.  The author has his own style and he states (I paraphrase here) that his method makes no use of cones, cylinders, etc. I guess that that is his \\"contemporary perspective\\". Perhaps I am naive on this point but I believe that many classical artists made use of egg and block shapes and these did not make their drawings/paintings deficient. I will try out Ryder's methods with a full understanding that they are another way of drawing that may or may not work for me. I am certainly, at this point in my own work, open to just about anything.       His drawings show much work and technical skill. In his book however, Iwould have preferred that he show drawings from the work of other artists who use the same or a similar methodology. For example, why not show some work from his teacher and friend, Ted Seth Jacobs upon whom he is quite effusive in praise?       That's my review up to this point in the book.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I had read some of the bad reviews these have gotten, so I knew what to look for in case I had to send these back. I wanted wireless because I have kids, and kids trip over wires. Plus I wanted surround sound. So I picked the X41's. I am happy to report that these are perfect for my needs. They have great sound, and yes I can hear what direction the footsteps are coming from. As far as a hiss, yes it's there but hardly noticeable. Does it \\"crackle and pop\\" from RF interference, yes, if you walk 30 feet or more away from the transmitter (which is the X41's advertised range). If you are within that range, crystal clear. I am not using Wifi on my Xbox, and my wireless router is upstairs, so that may be some of the reason I don't have any problems. As far as I am concerned the X41's delivered what they promised.<br /><br />Chat boost = Awesome<br /><br />Bass boost = Awesome<br /><br />Surround sound = Awesome<br /><br />Wireless = Awesome<br /><br />Battery life = Meh, buy some rechargeable ones. When the batteries go you have no<br />warning, the headset just goes dead.<br /><br />Build = Good. Take care of your equipment, you'll be fine.<br /><br />Comfort = Good/Awesome. Good for me as I have big ears and have to tuck them in. Would be Awesome for any normal human.<br /><br />All in all I would totally recommend them to anyone. Yeah, they are a little pricy. But if you want the best you got to pay for it.

1591843065|3.0|Like many books, \\"Back of the Napkin\\" seems to have begun with a brilliant very short concept that someone (correctly) thought would sell like hotcakes if padded out into a full-length book. The author really does present significant insights, but the irony is that they would have been best summarized literally on the back of a napkin, rather than dragging them out into full book form. So it reads like a 300-slide PowerPoint presentation advocating brevity.<br /><br />The sequel, \\"Unfolding the Napkin\\" (which I also read) is better thought out, serves more as a method, and contains more visual examples - but it still rehashes pretty much the same material as the first book in order to make its point, so reading both books was redundant in my opinion.
0802798225|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!! OMG, i was just blown away. The characters are well done and the author makes the character's relationship develop throughout the book. Alex and Brittany's relationship is quite believable. There was nothng forced and their relationshipp progressed throghout the story quite well. I loved the way how the author included steretypes and more than what meets the eye themes. Brittany pretends her life is perfect in front of everyone and crumbles down her facade when she is with Alex. Alex is a bad boy and he deals with the real issues of being in a gang. Everything that occurs in this story really happens whithin gangs in our world. The plot and the entire story is completely believeable. The romance between Alex and Brittany is so mesmerizing and touching. It is a beautiful book and never once was I ever bored when reading this story. I was always anxious to know what happens next!!! PLEASE READ!!! MUST REAAAD!!
B002ZG9788|3.0|In ancient Greece, men have started to revolt against the gods, and the gods are not happy about this development.  After a massive statue of Zeus (Liam Neeson) is dumped into the ocean, Zeus' brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), takes vengeance on the perpetrators, killing a family of innocent bystanders.  The family includes the parents and sister of Perseus (Sam Worthington), who becomes our protagonist.  Hades (who feeds off the fear and hatred of mankind) convinces Zeus (who basks in the love of mankind) to teach the silly humans a lesson.  Zeus reluctantly agrees, and Hades begins a war upon the Kingdom of Argos.  Only Perseus can prevent the destruction of Argos and save mankind.<br /><br />\\"Clash of the Titans\\" is a bit silly at times, and like many movies of its ilk, it relies on an overly complicated back story that is related as a prologue.  It's easy to lose interest and get lost before the story even gets started.  However, the story here is not really that important when it comes right down to it.  That'd be the sword fights, battles, and special effects.  For an early summer popcorn movie, \\"Clash of the Titans\\" is above average.  In particular, the special effects are quite well done without being overly fussy, especially the horrific monster, Kracken.<br /><br />How does it compare to the original 1981 film on which it is based?  The 1981 version has become a bit of a camp classic, replete with horrible acting and even worse special effects.  However, it's also a rather fun movie (although I haven't seen it since I was a teenager).  I'd say that this new version is less fun but much better directed and acted.  Ralph Fiennes is actually quite good as Hades, even if his role consists mostly of appearing and then dissipating as a cloud of black smoke.  I also liked the character of Io (Gemma Arterton) - Perseus's benevolent protector.  Sam Worthington is not a particularly good action hero for me; he's a bit too bland and boring.  However, he can act rings around the original Perseus, Harry Hamlin.  I'd call the battle of the \\"Clashes\\" a draw.  I did miss the mechanical owl, Bubo (look fast for his cameo!), but many people will find his absence a blessing.  Incidentally, the movie was not available in 3-D in my area, so this review is for the 2-D version.inal Perseus, Harry Hamlin.  I'd call the battle of the \\"Clashes\\" a draw.

B002RAREAK|2.0|Well folks,  I don't know what side of the tracks you're from but I've been following Usher from THE BEGINNING!  Being only a few years older than him, I could always count on him to give us mid 30's crowd, grown and sexy music,after all, that's what we represent.(MY MOM EVEN LOVES USHER!)    Now to the music, having said that...I just KNEW Usher had moved on to \\"grown man\\" status in music making, filling the void of the Luthers, Freddie Jacksons and Joes of the world.  To be honest, besides Musiq, there are NO OTHER singers closely hitting the mark of true R&B music making status, coupled with the artistry of Michael Jackson.  Having said all that, Here I Stand could have been the perfect segue into a very mature album with Grammy potential.  Unfortunately, this album doesn't even BEGIN to tap into this talented musicians fiber of skill!    I'll try to capture a few highlights..cuz I truly love the guy and wish him well!  There Goes My Baby - has commercial slow jam radio potential   Pro Lover  -has that Confessions swagger I loved.    Okay - I can get with the little 80's fantasy vibe.  Kinda sounds' like something Musiq could rock   Makin Love MAY be his commerical slow jam single.  Sounds like something Neo wrote or would sing.    Overall,  Sorry kids..it's not my favorite and I hope when Usher goes back to the lab, he will remember us Grown and Sexy folk who have his back and really BUY music!    Love ya Usher!~
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|\\"The Reader\\" struck me as a most unusual movie.  As I watched it unfold, I found myself drawn into it more and more despite some significant shortcomings.  The film begins as a fairly racey \\"coming of age\\" story.  A 15 year-old boy encounters an older woman (at one time mistaken as his mother) and things develop.  Things end abruptly when the older woman leaves with no forwarding address.  Naturally, things resume later only this time the 15 year old is a young adult law student in Germany (everything takes place in Germany but no one speaks German).  Now the former lover (looking a bit older) is on trial for Holocaust crimes.  The young man wrestles with the unfolding truth while holding back on his own knowledge of the truth.  Well, I'm not trying to give away the plot but eventually something unique and wonderful happens as the film makes its' way to a bumpy end.      For a movie about relationships, this was a movie that was equally guitly of not clarifying relationships.  One night the teenage boy has to nervously make up his excuse for being late for supper and the rest of the nights who knows when he gets home.  I suspect that an arrangement of some sort of boarding school happened when I blinked.  How about the marriage that failed without us ever really knowing it happened.  Of course a total of 2 minutes of good dialogue was all that was needed to explore the deep and fragile relationship between father and child.  Then there's the brief appearances of Ralph Fiennes which constituted top billing.  Oh well, Kate Winslet is the movie; not Ralph or his youthful understudy.  This film is about nobody doing the right thing with a major lone exception and that is where the film's title comes in.
0786868724|5.0|The book was a gift to a friend in prison.  He loved it and it has since been making its way through some of his fellow residents.  Its story of two vastly different men and their struggles with faith is a timely one for us all, free or incarcerated.  I highly recommend this book.
0307408833|1.0|I bought this book because the review I read on it sounded very appealing.  At first I was excited when I looked through the book but after making several recipes, here are my issues.<br /><br />1) Every recipe uses coconut oil.  Very expensive as you use half the jar.<br />2) All breads, especially the Lemon Poppyseed Teabread, takes way longer to cook then the recipe indicates and it ends up being a googy mess.  The middle falls and doesn't cook.  If you cook them as cupcakes, they are okay.<br />3) Seems like most recipes have the same dull taste.<br />4) Instructions are not complete.  I never used coconut oil before and didn't have a clue how to use it.<br />5) Frosting does not come out properly.<br /><br />I have other vegan muffin recipes that use maple syrup or olive oil or carrot juice for the liquids and they are much better.<br /><br />The only recipe that I found I really like are the Zucchini Muffins.<br /><br />If this is NY's finest, then the author should come out to the West Coast because we have way better vegan desserts out here!

B001GKJ2FM|3.0|The Manufacture is not at fault, but I received a used product that was rated as in very good condition, and it continually stops in one certain place, even after carefully cleaning the product.

B0036EBARO|4.0|2010 marks ten years since the release of Goldfrapp's debut album \\"Felt Mountain\\". Along the way the duo, Will Gregory and Alison Goldfrapp, have dabbled in electronica, folk, ambient, new wave, and to some degree, soul music. Their fifth album \\"Head First\\" is somewhat a return to \\"Black Cherry\\" and \\"Supernature\\", their previous electronic albums.<br /><br />However, \\"Head First\\" is not as cold and cool as those albums. This album is more late 70's/early 80's synth disco. In fact, I have read many reviews name-dropping Abba, Giorgio Moroder and Olivia Newton-John, which I agree with, but I have to add Billy Joel, Blondie and Pat Benatar as well. Just listen to \\"Alive\\" and it's mixture of Olivia Newton-John and Electric Light Orchestra's \\"Xanadu\\"-like synth swells and the Billy Joel mash up of \\"My Life\\" and \\"It's Still Rock And Roll To Me\\" electric piano melody and vocal tilt respectively.<br /><br />First single \\"Rocket\\" is an excellent example of taking the genre and giving it a new face lift. Same with \\"Believer\\".<br /><br />\\"Dreaming\\" and \\"Hunt\\" are the two moodier tracks, coming off like after-club trances. \\"Head First\\" is Pat Benatar's \\"Shadows Of The Night\\" incarnate without the guitar. \\"Shiny And Warm\\", like many reviews have already pointed out, is the only track similar to something you'd find on \\"Supernatural\\". \\"I Wanna Life\\" closes the album on a high before the lyric-less \\"Voicething\\" kicks in. It was my least favorite track at first, but with repeated listening I have come to appreciate it more.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Head First\\" is foot first, as in, upbeat and shiny dance moodiness circa 1978-1983. \\"Flashdance\\" comes to mind, and it's a good thing. Alison Goldfrapp was born in 1966, so she lived (and was likely influenced by) that time period, just like I did. It's one of the reasons I have liked Goldfrapp all these years--they remind me of that time.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Head First\\" compares to Goldfrapp's other albums:<br /><br />2000 Felt Mountain: Three and a Half Stars<br />2003 Black Cherry: Four Stars<br />2006 Supernature: Three and a Half Stars<br />2008 Seventh Tree: Three and a Half Stars<br />2010 Head First: Four StarsStars  2006 Supernature: Three and a Half Stars  2008 Seventh Tree: Three and a Half Stars  2010 Head First: Four Stars
0064410935|5.0|A classic story of friends helping friends.<br />The shy pig Wilbur befriends the smart and wise spider Charlotte. When Wilbur got into trouble and his life was in danger, Charlotte came up with a genius idea to save Wilbur. She awed the people on the farm and town with words she weaves into her web, making it look like some kind of magic, praising the smartness of the pig and with that saves him from a tragic fate.<br />A remarkable book with black/white illustrations throughout. The story is enchanting and heartwarming. The true value of friendship is made clear by showing how the animals in the story work together to save the pig.<br />Even a shy little pig can be a big star and can have it's shining moment.

B002ZG9788|1.0|I loved the Clash of the Titans as a child and I still enjoy it. I decided to ignore the film critics and see this thing. See people told me not to pay attention to critics. Never mind a 20% or so rotten rating at rotten tomatoes, for example. They got my 10 bucks. And couple hours I'll never get back. I have noting good to say about this thing. Elements of what goes into a decent film are not present. Of all the mediocre and terrible remakes this ranks at the bottom.<br />Edit (04/07): A little more.<br />The first pre-cgi, pre-video game paradigm movie had a stillness to it and reality that only real sets can achieve. And a stillness brought to the screen during a time when people could sit in a theater and pay attention without busting out with brightly shinning phones to text message.<br /><br />Seems like people younger than late 20s don't even notice.<br /><br />Did you notice the tranquility on Mt. Olympus? Sure the set sucked, but for its time it was good and *what matters now is it doesn't feel like a video game*.<br /><br />Laurence Olivier's performance has lasted. Liam Neeson's will not. Why?<br /><br />And who made a better hero Harry Hamlin or the Avatar manikin?<br /><br />And what about the old playwright played by Burgess Meredith of Rocky and tv series Batman fame (as The Penguin)? He largely made the movie for me. Compare the playwright to the immortal whatever-she-was that I guess was meant to take his place as a sort of story guide or something (Never mind she dies too, which is another idiotic plot hole).

031606792X|5.0|This book is a fantastic read. If you've read the other books in the Twilight series you will absolutely love this book. In my opinion, the best in the series. This book explains quite a bit about Jacob and Bella's relationship, and also reveals intimate details between Edward and Bella. The Volturi make a comeback, and Bella discovers that her ability to lock Edward out of her head is no longer a burden to her, as she finds new use for this talent. Not only will you not be able to put this book down, but you'll be begging for more!
B002T9H2LA|2.0|I realize, given the director, that this would be a violent movie.  I was disappointed that it came out in a comic book-like direction.  Brad Pitt was more of a distraction.  His accent was laughable and, that squint, looked as though he were trying to channel Popeye.    The dividing of the film into \\"chapters,\\" made one wonder if the director were trying to bypass a more smooth transition of the story.    Glad that I only rented this movie - only out $2.50.
B0032SQCQI|3.0|OK...OK...it wasn't really that bad but, it wasn't that good either.  It's basically a thriller.    Let's put it this way.  Acting - 3 out of 5 stars    Plot - 3 out of 5 stars   1. The plot started off really slow...really slow.   2. Still it really got interesting. I usually figure movies like this out right away and get bored.   3. OK, so this brings us to the end. What in the world???? That's why I couldn't figure it out because it's nonsense.   You constantly think - holy cow this is gonna get good.....and then....it ends. Kind of annoying.    Special effects - 3 out of 5    So, it was worth 4 bucks and the 2 hours just don't expect 4 or 5 stars.
0521484782|1.0|I don't even know what to say about this book, except that is is so awful, so inane, so disjointed and ridiculous that this book is a SKIP! I read it for my book club and it is one of the most disorganized group of short stories masquerading as a cohesive novel that have barely a thread to keep this whole thing from falling apart. Simply the worst book I can recall reading (and...well, finishing!)<br /><br />I suppose the first chapter about Noah's Ark was interesting enough and funny in moments, but I just couldn't wait to turn a page because the pacing is so plodding. I finally just ended up skimming over the unimportant parts (of which there are many). And just to be jerked from one story that has nothing to do with another story and peddling it as a novel is misleading.<br /><br />A terrible book. I am loathe to give it even one star, because it doesn't deserve a half a star. What a waste of paper. If you see it i a book store, run away! FAST!!!! (I guess I'm a little bitter since this is my book club selection and I have to finish it. At least here, I have a place to vent before the meeting next week.

(Thankfully, I sorted my things out long before Rob ever did.)

0061703257|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK!  I got the book because I always like to read a book before I see a movie...and I'm SO glad I did.  The book is well written and it has mind-bending twists to keep you coming back for more.  The ending was PERFECT. I bit on the confusing side, but it kept me thinking for days after I finished reading.  I definitely recommend, if you like psychological thrillers, this is the book for you!
B001OQCV2O|2.0|The special effects were very good.  If you like seeing the world get distroyed - this is the movie for you.  The story line was just - OK.  OK - the world is coming to an end - got it!  Now what.  Out run - out last - and watch everyone else get killed.  OK - what next?  Kind of a let down.  It sees that money or power (or speed) were the only reasons that people deserved to be \\"saved\\".  If I become rich enough or famous enough (or fast enough) - can I be \\"saved\\" too?  The few swear words that were in the movie - could have been left out and it would have been a much better movie.  Save your money - wait for it to hit the bargin-bin.
B000003S2O|5.0|Having already described Tangerine Dream's \\"Zeit\\" album as 'the great-granddaddy of all dark ambient albums,\\" I'll simply describe this one as the album without which other releases in the genre would have been impossible - and impossible to supersede as well! Eno's manifold talents as a musician, artist and producer all come to the fore in one ineffable piece of work here.    As others have described, this is a baffling accomplishment in many ways. It is both very obviously \\"studio-based\\" music and simultaneously his most organic effort. It falls into the cracks so successfully in so many realms that it attains what is probably the best argument for his reputation as a \\"purposeful genius\\" that I can imagine.    Emotional, cold - reflective and yet very much in the present, it's a timeless piece of work. There is little doubt in my mind that people will be listening to this two centuries hence with the same feelings of obscure nostalgia and appreciation for the day at hand as we do right now.
B0035J6TAI|4.0|I've never before been moved to write a review on Amazon.  There are times when the opinions are a little silly or uninformed, and other times that the opinions are childish and mean.  Usually, I can weed through the nonsense.  For me, there are five phases to my response to this album.  1# I became aware that Peter was releasing a new album: I was both excited and nostalgic.  2) Within minutes, I became filled with dread because the nostalgia generally overwhelms the new work: so I was worried that I would hate it.  3) Now hating the idea of buying the new album, I was even more upset with myself for ordering it from Amazon; so, to really rub it in and to punish myself (\\"that'll teach me!\\"), I bought the \\"deluxe\\" two disc version. 4) Having received the album, I dreaded opening it; and upon opening it and playing it, I pretty much glossed over it and didn't pay too much attention to it as I let my itunes-ADD tune out the album. 5) I have become aware that I cannot stop listening to this album: it is light, it is soaring, it is frightening and anxious...and while completely professional and grand, it is so intimate that it's almost embarrassing.  This is very possibly the best work that PG has done since III and Security, and it speaks well to all of his best work.  This album is almost nothing like those 80's albums in tone or tempo, but what most pulls me into this album is how easily it is to connect to PG's emotions throughout.  Very Well Done!!
0679720200|4.0|At 120 pages, The Stranger is a very quick read and contains much more than initially appears under its surface. It's also a wonderful turn of prose when you realize that Meursault is not just aloof but an absolute sociopath. Definitely a book that I need to read again to delve even deeper into it's themes of apathetic absurdism.
0393072231|4.0|I've never read any of his previous books, but since I am a hedge fund manager, I decided to pick up this book. The start of the book was somewhat dry, but once I got past the first chapter, things started to get interesting. But again, I am in the investing business, so I can relate to what the author was writing about. But for those that aren't in the finance industry, it is worth the read to educate yourself on what happened during the real estate boom and bust

0307386171|3.0|In retrospect On Cheslin Beach succeeds as a rumination on a relationship that was and what might have been. I emphasize the retrospect though, as the feeling it left me with upon completion was stilted. Because this one doesn't quite cut the expected McEwan mustard as a thoroughly compelling narrative. In particular the final bits are rushed and it seems that McEwan knew what he wanted to write about but not how to wrap it up with the same attention that he gave it's first three quarters. I didn't have a sense for it's conclusion as I read it, which is a good sign, as the two lovers grapple with the minutiae of their interiors and exterior. The theme of pre-sexual revolution era England is well done, as is the familiar territory of the obvious class issues England has. McEwan is a master of interior space, with the express value of connecting it to the unknown outside world. That essence holds, but ultimately On Cheslin Beach is a middle aged man's wondering about the woman he had and didn't succeed with because he didn't.
097747609X|3.0|I read this book because I wanted to know what Hitler was all about.  I wanted to know why he did what he did.  But, more than that, I wanted to know the truth behind the argument.  Everyone compares their political opponents to Hitler.  The Left accuses the Right of being like HItler.  And the Right accuses the Left of being like Hitler.  I wanted to KNOW who was right.  This book answered that question.  (The answer is:  Thankfully, NO ONE in modern American Politics is like Hitler in any important respect.  Yes, he was a socialist, but the reason for his socialism and method for achieving it are COMPLETELY different from the modern American socialists like Barack Obama.)       I learned a lot reading this book.  I learned a lot about the rise of the National Socialist Movement (at least from Hitler's point of view).  Before reading, many parts of  WWII history seemed unrelated to me-but now I can see how they are linked (at least in Hitler's mind.)  But, the biggest thing I learned makes me profoundly sad.  World War II need never have happened.  He could have been stopped.  It was ALL there either in explicit form, or by logical extension considering the work as a whole.  The anschluss with Austria, the alliance with Russia that wasn't really an alliance, the invasion of Poland, the invasion of Russia, the invasion France, and even the actions against the Jews-it was all there.  Any statesman reading Mein Kampf in the 1930s should have seen that Hitler was following his domestic agenda exactly as laid out in Mein Kampf and realized that he MEANT every word!  This should have set off the alarm bells-and actions taken to stop him.      If we are smart, we will learn our lesson time Mein Kampf.  Our modern day politicians should look around at what various world leaders say about hostile intentions an take it seriously.      Now, about the experience of reading this book.  For a moment, forget the evil this man did.  Forget all the anti-semetism in this book.  Forget all the foreshadowing of things to come.  This is a TERRIBLY written book.  Large sections of this book seemed to be a stream of consciousness rant about some minor incident or obscure line of thought.  This made it incredibly difficult maintain my attention.  I had to FORCE myself to finish the book.  That being said, there were some very interesting parts to this book, so I couldn't just give it 1 star.  I settled on 3.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Musically, X&Y fails to break any new ground for the band but I would be hard pressed to call that a bad thing. However, the band has definitely come into their own in the realm of layering and production and the sonic maturity is evident throughout the album. Everything is bigger on X&Y. Coldplay knew they would be playing stadiums this time around and they wrote the album accordingly. You can almost hear the screams when the guitar lick from \\"Talk\\" kicks in - it's the tried and true Coldplay formula, now with bigger and better hooks.<br /><br />On the lyrical side of things Martin sticks to a theme of love and commitment along the album's journey. It's obvious that Martin is very much in love, specifically with wife Gwyneth Paltrow and his daughter Apple (must...resist...sarcasm), and he wears it on his sleeve on X&Y. Songs like \\"Fix You\\" and \\"A Message\\" read more like pages from a diary when you realize that these were written by a husband to his wife while she struggled to come to terms with the death of her father. It's voyeuristic almost to the point of being uncomfortable.<br />Coldplay also one-ups themselves by writing another \\"perfect\\" song. On A Rush Of Blood To The Head they gave us \\"Clocks\\" which, in my opinion, was perfect in every way from music to hook to lyric. On X&Y, \\"White Shadows\\" has this honor. It's a rare thing when a song comes together in this way - even more rare for lightning to strike twice. But they aren't all winners. The band stumbles hard on the album's official closer, the meandering \\"Twisted Logic.\\" Thankfully it's redeemed with the hidden track \\"Til Kingdom Come,\\" a hymn-like acoustic gem that was originally written for Johnny Cash before he passed.<br /><br />Coldplay had their work cut out for them in creating a follow-up to perhaps one of the strongest sophomore efforts ever, the much-lauded Rush. While I truly believe that no band could have lived up to the hype set before them, I was a disappointed to see that Coldplay moved not forward with X&Y but sideways. As I said before, X&Y is a great album but for a band to truly be world-class they need to move forward - Coldplay took the safe route. (Until Viva La Vida, that is!)&Y but sideways.

0385504225|5.0|Loved everyone of Dan Brown's books and this one did not disappoint. The beginning was a bit slow, but once past the 1st chapter, I could not put the book down.
0451196716|3.0|Don't think there is more to this story than what is mentioned in the title.  The whole book focuses on the long walk a group of 100 teenagers take in New England.  During this walk, there are plenty of character moments and insight into who these people are.  I would have loved to have read more about the society where this walk would happen.  This book is not as strong, in my opinion, as the other Bachman book I read (THE RUNNING MAN).  There are plenty of good moments in this novel, but there are also more areas where I felt the story dragged.  I will say that the Bachman persona is surely a dark writer.  Both of these books have featured very bleak outlooks on our society.  I know that King often writes about dark topics (PET SEMETARY being a perfect example), but these two books are very dark.

B002VECM6S|5.0|Our whole family enjoyed this story about a boy who gets in to a private school thanks to a caring friend of his, despite the fact that he barely has any education or desire to do anything but survive.  Survival for this child is an uncomplaining journey to live peacefully, without anyone noticing him or bothering him.  He washes his one pair of shorts in a sink at the laundromat and dries them in another's customer's dryer.  He sleeps in the gym because that's where it is warm.  He is taken in by the school because of his size, and into a woman's home because she feels compelled to make certain he has a warm place to sleep for a night.  It is soon recognized by all that this gentle giant just wants to be loved, and so love he gets.  The best part of the story is understanding how he gets through life without bitterness or anger at the cards life dealt him:  He is following his mother's words of wisdom, though she had nothing else to give him.  Sandra Bullock gets the lion's share of accolades for her portrayal of a headstrong woman determined to live life good and to see that a child she can tell is good gets a fair shot, but it is her new \\"son\\" played by Quinton Aaron who provides the most brilliant and inspired acting in the film.  Fun moments are provided by the youngest son in the movie who adores the new big brother his family adopts.
B00008G9JM|5.0|Ian and the lads at their creative best, never in the annals  of rock music has composition soared to such original heights !<br />Helped with is arguably their best line up and at the right time in history for such an endeavor \\"A Passion Play\\" just is probably one of the best albums ever made!<br /> I think it's the mother of all concept albums even more than 'Thick as a Brick\\", lyrically  it is as deep and obscure as one can get yet Ian has such a firm hand on things and the band is just perfect and all things just fall into place. Bravo! A one in a lifetime event!<br />Unfortunately it was all down hill from that...Prog had hit its peak!
B002RAREAK|1.0|Seriously, I really liked Confessions CD.  I also like his older stuff,  but what it that?!  Childish lyrics which have no mature as Confessions had.    when you be putting your heels on   i swear your body's so perfect baby   how you work it baby yea  uuh there goes my baby    LOL ?    please...    the songs are totally overproduced and forgeteable.  but yeah still goes #1.    The best new song is MORE, which didn't even make on the CD.
B000002TQV|5.0|This was the first Radiohead album I ever owned. I bought this album when it was first released in the 1990s. I didn't love every song when I was younger. As I get older, however, and relisten to Radiohead's first albums, my opinion has changed (Or maybe it's my tastes.)     Even though I own all of their albums, I'm beginning to appreciate their music -- and all their songs -- even more than I did when I was younger. I don't know if experience has changed me, but the words in many of the songs on \\"The Bends\\" have even more meaning than they did. I still own the original CD of this album.    I agree with those reviewers say that this is Radiohead's most accessible album. The album has a beautiful range of anthem-like songs (\\"The Bends\\"), to pacific ballads (\\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\"), and rock songs. \\"Planet Telex\\" is one of my favorites off the album, along with \\"Just\\" -- *you do it to yourself, you do (and that's why it really hurts!)    Radiohead are one of the best artists (although my opinion is biased because they're one of my favorite bands.) They're good musicians and exceptional lyricists. I love their sarcastic sense of humor on their songs, their existential, abstract lyrics.     Some reviewers have claimed that people who love Radiohead are just being pretending to like them. That's not the case for me. I know, not everyone's going to connect to their music as I do. People have different music tastes: we'll have to agree to disagree.    As for Radiohead (and The Bends)-- this is always going to have a special place in my heart, in my music collection and on my IPOD!
0140430105|5.0|\\"Emma\\" is a multi-layered tale of self-deception and self-discovery; as claustrophobic and at the same time as sparkling as the interior of a glass Christmas tree ornament. At one level it's a telling of the familiar \\"what you wanted was right there all along\\". But much of what we see is filtered through the thoughts of Emma - and she is such a deliciously unreliable narrator. She's clever, and knows herself to be so, which makes her (often willful) blindness about almost everything all the more delightful.<br /><br />In the hands of a lesser author Emma could be loathsome. Because this is Austen, we can smile at the happy ending that Emma's machinations have kept from her for so long.
B0035J6TA8|5.0|When I heard that Gabriel was going to do a covers CD, I couldn't help but be disappointed. It has been a long time since his last recording and it's hard to look forward to something that often becomes a forgettable part of any artist's collection. I shouldn't have underestimated Gabriel's talent. On SCRATCH MY BACK does not just cover songs, he transforms them. Through the use of orchestration and his distinctive phrasing, these songs become new works that stand on their own, ostensibly becoming Peter Gabriel songs. Songs like \\"Heroes,\\" probably my favorite Bowie song, become a meditation instead of a proclamation and \\"My Body is Cage\\" is now a wistful lament instead of an angry cry. Each song is rendered with such thought and care; it becomes very easy to forget the originals, quite an accomplishment. I am sure some Gabriel fans are bitterly disappointed, but as someone who has been listening since the beginning of his solo career, I found this to be one more example of Gabriel's talent.
B0017XCDN6|5.0|\\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" gives Americans a needed insight into the mind of Japanese fighting men in WWII. I was moved by their story and the incredible commitment of their officers and the loyalty of the dog-faces to their officers. This film also gives us an insight into the determination and commitment of Japanese minds behind their very successful businesses.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I was tempted by the cheaper prices on the Amazon marketplace (around 100 dollars), and sure enough I got the Chinese bootleg. The sound quality was great, but there are a number of telltale signs. Past Masters has both cd's smashed into one sleeve, sure to scratch it. All the sleeves seemed tight fitting and it was an effort getting the discs out. On many occasions my disk stuck to the sleeve due to the wet ink when packaged. George Harrison's name is spelled in several different ways on the back of Revolver, and the track listing of the White Album has one song listed twice. There is no anti-piracy label next to the UPC code. The DVD has a faded apple. Many Chinese bootlegs have a red pull out ribbon rather than the black one. I had the black one, so I thought it was safe, so it took me a few days to notice these other irregularities, and it also shows that the Chinese bootleggers may be adjusting as we get wise. I also did not get the Chinese characters at the beginning of the DVD, which others have reported.     Other than that, the Beatles music is great, and I highly recommend getting their entire catalog.
B003A9584Q|4.0|Hey, don't get me wrong, the White Stripes are one of the best bands out there. They make great albums and they perform great live, but this doesn't quite capture them at their best. I understand that a certain \\"rawness\\" was part of the concept behind these recordings, but sometimes that rawness comes across as inferior sound quality. This is well worth owning, but judging only by the band's own impossibly high standards, you should make sure you pick up their concert DVD \\"Under Blackpool Lights\\", which captures them at their absolute best.
B002EWD08Q|2.0|The clever thoughtful lyrics remain, but musically HUMBUG seems trapped.  The title \\"The Fire and The Thud\\" sums up my feelings about the first 6 cuts. The sound in the first half of the CD repeats itself ad nauseum, bass and drums in a depressing combo that drags down everything else into the same muddled and unpleasant sound.  When you finally get a break on songs like \\"Cornerstone\\" it`s a welcome respite from a very dismal sound. Finally the lighter and more musical touch of their previous work makes an appearance. While I think it's important for a band to continue to evolve, I much preferred the balanced approach of the first CD to this one. The last few cuts make this much more palatable, but I still find myself less than inclined to give HUMBUG the multiple plays that WHATEVER PEOPLE SAY got.
0786868724|5.0|One of the best books I've read in 2 years.  A story of spiritual renewal, hope and forgiveness that everyone might relate to.  Also a story of how people of different faiths and life circumstances can understand each other and exist in peace.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|The 1981 Clash of the Titans was/still is a campy yet visually stunning fantasy classic. Campy? You ask? How could it not be, the Myths and archetypes by very definition are larger than life, so it stands to reason that the remake is going to have some camp to it, as well. And it does, but it doesn't disappoint as a popcorn picture, there the remake, like the original delivers. The original has the lovely Harry Hamlin, seriously,  Perseus is prettier than Princess of Argos  Andromeda. In the remake, up-and-comer Sam Worthington (Terminator 4, Avator) plays Perseus and has even less to do with the Princess than in the original, but he sure ain't no pretty-boy, and the new Andromeda is pretty, but Perseus is matched with the cursed and hauntingly attractive IO, this time round. Worthington's Perseus is even more of a reluctant hero than Hamlin, playing the everyman, a fisherman who has his great destiny thrust upon him. We get  more of a glimse of his back story this time, including the flashback to Zeus' seduction of Perseus' mother and another origin for Calibos tied to the bastard demi-god's birth (instead of the cursed son of goddess Thetis. Not from any real Greek myth, It has been said that Calibos was based on Caliban from \\"The Tempest\\" by William Shakespeare.)<br /><br /> The story is pretty similar to both the original and the myth; Perseus' re-gifted winged sandals still don't make it to the film's finale. The Mortals feeling as if they have been abandoned declare war on the gods,  Hades  leads the retaliation upon mankind in an attempt to seize power and usurp his brother Zeus. Perseus' adopted family is killed as Perseus swears vengeance Lord of the Underworld. Prideful Queen Cassiopeia again compares her daughter's beauty to that of the gods, to make amends Andromeda must be sacrificed or the whole city will be lost. Son of Zeus Perseus ends up on a quest to save Argos (and the lovely Andromeda ) from the punishment of the Kraken, collecting gifts and companions along the way, like some sword & sandals Magnificent Seven. Unlike the original, this film better captures the sense of scale between the gods and their strife with their less loyal subjects. It feels less like the Argons are the sole mortal effected. The bar for the gods is naturally raised, impressive transmutations and grand entrances and appearances, an homage to the clay figures of the original, only vaster.<br /><br />Although there are no Knights or Dames, the casting for the 2010 film is as impressively close to overkill as the original with egos such as Liam Neeson as Zeus (Olivier in '81), Ralph Fiennes a.k.a. Lord Voldemort is a perfect fit for Hades (omitted from the original). As I said Worthington replaces Harry Hamlin as Perseus, the lovely French actress Alexa Davalo as Andromeda (for Judi Bowker), Gemma Arterto( soon to be seen in Prince of Persia) plays  Io, who befriends Perseus in a much sexier way that Bergus Meridth's character. Luke Evans has a couple lines as the \\"prettier than Harry Hamlin\\"other son of Zeus, APOLLO ( ironicly enough Evans will BE playing Zeus in 2011's Dawn of War). A number of models are cast, well, to look pretty;  for example Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova gets her turn as a much lovelier more sympatric Medusa than you would expect, and English beauty Agyness Deyn stands as little more than Olympus window-dressing as Aphrodite. Speaking of pretty, the movie was filmed mostly on location in the Canary Islands, and cinematography makes full use of the lush Greekish scenery .<br /><br />The Great Ray Harryhausen (Jason & the Argonauts), stop-motion genius behind all of the mythological critters of the '81 original initially questioned the need for a remake...but approved of the effects of this one. The homage to his brilliant serpent-bodied Medusa is apparent, as is the return of the the giant scorpions, the Pegasus, Calibos and not to mention the over-the-top sea-monstery goodness of the Kraken for the climax.Speaking of homages, Bebo cameo at the half-hour mark. One new addition the Djinn, desert  mages who extend their immortally by replace their flesh with  \\"charwood and black magic,\\" appearing  as nightmarish treelike Middle-Earth figures  with glowing blue eyes and wicked teeth. The visuals are pleasing, but the movie was retrofitted with the 3-D effect, so it has it's moments, but isn't super, but the directing style of Louis Leterrier (Hulk) lends itself to the techniques used for the process.<br /><br />Best not to think of this as a re-make, but a Spring Break distraction, for which it serves it's purpose...<br />I expect the Kraken will soon topple the Dragons & their trainers from the box office weeklys.bo cameo at the half-hour mark.

0446619078|5.0|THE LAST COYOTE sees Bosch at one of his lowest points. Suspended for punching out a superior officer, his house condemned after an earthquake, and his only hope to get back on the job is a police department employed shrink who Bosch is prepared to hate. But this visit to the psychiatrist allows Bosch to examine one of his life's great mysteries, who murdered his mother, a local \\"good time girl\\" who had lost custody of Bosch and was trying to get him back. His investigation takes him from LA to Florida and what he finds out over the course of his investigation leads him to some still powerful politicians and the corruption that they once represented. As Bosch discovers some of the main players still alive, he starts a reckless campaign to find the truth regardless of the cost, a campaign that will end up making others pay the ultimate price for his actions. With a very believable twist and a deeply involving mystery from the start, Connelly has Bosch in top form in this entry of the series.
B003102JDM|3.0|Only the genius of Coen brothers could undertake with such brilliant incisiveness, the progressive existential deconstruction of a Jewish University teacher, who suddenly sees how his world begins to become him a true whirlwind, when a set of unexpected events set in movement.<br /><br />The acidic plot (whose narrative pulse would seem at first glance borrowed from Woddy Allen's approach)is merciless, devastating but never falls into a mournful or indulgent vision. As a matter of fact, the epilogue of the movie invites us to think that no human being may boast about his good fortune and that the elusive line between success and failure is thinner than we usually tend to think.<br /><br />The irreverent fact is that - for better or worst - nobody is innocent.<br /><br />A mature film that eventually could be better.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|While I've never agreed with the idea that only bad movies should be remade, the 1981 version of \\"Clash of the Titans\\" is a perfect example of why such statements are valid. This new 2010 version is, quite simply, a better film. It features special effects that are convincing, and with all due respect to his fans, the same cannot be said about the Ray Harryhausen claymation of the original. It tells a story that's equally preposterous but far less campy. The characters, while lacking any real depth, are given lines that no longer border on embarrassing. And the action sequences are much more exciting, in large part because of the aforementioned special effects, which are now presented in 3-D. When compared to the original, there really is no comparison.    As a standalone piece, however, it certainly isn't without its weaknesses. The story, while relatively easy to follow, is painfully short on detail, and it generally seems at a distance from the Greek mythology on which it's based. It's nothing more or less than a showcase of CGI, which means you're meant to look at it but not really think about what's going on. I don't mind this, as long as my senses aren't being assaulted; unlike recent big budget effects extravaganzas like \\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\\" and \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,\\" \\"Clash of the Titans\\" allows the audience to take in its visual delights, to savor the effort that went into them. One can watch it and actually be entertained.    The story focuses on a demigod named Perseus (Sam Worthington), born as the result of an affair between a mortal queen and the god Zeus (Liam Neeson). When his beloved adoptive family is killed at the hands of Zeus' wicked brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Perseus vows that he will have his revenge. He then ends up in the seaside city of Argos, where Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker) angers the gods by daring to claim that her daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), is more beautiful than the goddess Aphrodite. In response to this, Hades gives her two options: Either Argos will be destroyed by a monstrous sea creature known as the Kraken, or Andromeda will be sacrificed. Thus begins Perseus' heroic journey, one that will take him from the cave of the Stygian Witches to the ruined lair of Medusa.    Keeping continuous watch over Perseus is Io (Gemma Arterton), priestess for the goddess Hera. Why she's compelled to protect him is never adequately explained, although I suppose it has something to do with Zeus, who can't seem to decide whether or not Perseus should be helped or harmed. Why harmed? Because he, like the entire city of Argos, has turned his back on the gods and no longer offers his prayers to keep them sustained. I personally find that very immature coming from omnipotent beings, but then again, we find much immaturity and vengefulness in Greek mythology. Consider Artemis: Because a commander named Agamemnon killed a sacred stag, she wouldn't let him or the Greek Fleet sail to Troy unless his daughter, Iphigenia, was sacrificed.    I digress. The truth is that \\"Clash of the Titans,\\" while hardly a great movie, succeeds at being exactly what it wants to be. One can easily admire the work that went into the visuals, the makeup, the costumes, and the action. One of the most exciting sequences involves a disfigured king named Acrisius (Jason Flemyng), whose body has been fortified by Hades himself; when his blood drips onto the sand, it results in the creation of gigantic scorpions, which then flail wildly as Perseus and his men attack with full force. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed when it's eventually discovered that these beasts can be tamed and ridden like horses. Where's the fun in that?    And then there's the final sequence with the Kraken, featured prominently in the ads. The ensuing battle is surprisingly short, which, considering the level of technical wizardry on display, is a bit anticlimactic. Still, what little we are shown is exhilarating, aided greatly by the 3-D technology.    Sometimes, it's fun to see a movie that doesn't require the audience to think. It merely wants to entertain you, to take you on a two-hour journey away from life. That's exactly what \\"Clash of the Titans\\" did for me; it's an escapist film, a delightful distraction that consistently kept me involved. You don't often come across remakes that outshine their predecessors. Then again, when you consider how bad the original \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was, director Louis Leterrier and the screenwriters didn't have to try all that hard. It sort of makes you wonder, then, why no one thought to wait until now to make this into a movie. If we learned anything from the Ralph Bakshi version of \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" it's that we shouldn't force a movie into existence before the technology is available to do the story justice.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|My son got this toy with his birthday money and to say the least I was somewhat skeptical about how long it would be before it would be broken.  Not that he's tough on toys, but since \\"nothing is made the way it used to be\\".  Well to my surprise, it is extremely durable and he's been playing with it for almost a year.  Nothing has broken, nothing has needed to be fixed and other than a few lost darts (normal attrition), we've only had to pull out one dart that was mis-fed (put in backwards) and other than that it's been perfect.  You can also easily take it apart to give you a shorter gun and a hand gun which is kind of fun.  The gun has been taken apart and put together dozens and dozens of times with no issues.  The gun has a nice scope for \\"sniper\\" shooting, but it isn't telescopic or anything so the use of it is somewhat negligible - but still cool to pretend as there are legs under the barrel to give you even more \\"sniper\\" action.  The butt stock also extends in an out, but we didn't figure out what use that would really have.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the other ratings, but it's hard for me to understand the 1- and 2-star ratings unless you either A) got one that was already broken and you want to complain about it or B) you have a hellion as a kid and he breaks everything.  We also bought the adapter clip for his gun since the clip that comes with the gun only has 5 darts.  Kind of skimpy, but the gun as a whole is well worth it.  Because of his enjoyment of this particular Nerf gun, my son has bought three others all which he also thoroughly enjoys.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland is my fav. film by David Lynch. I got it a few days afer my film buying spree. I have no idea how Mulholland Dr. got stuck in my head and why i really wanted to buy a copy of it but I guess i got good taste that works on it's own!?<br /> I watched it twice in a row the day i got it. I love it. It's interesting and intense. Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring worked well together and made the movie work. I loved the song \\"I've told every little star\\" and my friend loved \\"Llorando\\" ( crying ). Mulholland was great un until the end, when they find the key that fits into the blue box. From their, the movie enters a different direction. It gets confusing and thats also why i watched the film twice, to better understnad what was going on or really going on. I think the ending is what you want to make it. Like it's an open ending, it could be anything. But that didn't stop me from enjoying the film. It's great but i wish in a way it could have just ended normally instead of taking some strange turn, like a horror movie that can't just end, no, it has to have some scary ending moment or whatever. Anway, if you like David Lynch films, then you will like Mulholland Dr. If you don't like David Lynch, i'm sure you'll still like the movie so watch it.
0385504225|2.0|Due to many things going on in life, I had not been able to  begin \\"The Lost Symbol\\" until about a week ago.  I was looking forward to a fun, intriguing read like I had experienced with both \\"DaVinci\\" and \\"Angels\\", both books that I thoroughly enjoyed.    However, I was tremendously disappointed in \\"Symbol\\".  By the time I reached page 20, I could already tell you the entire storyline, complete with twists and locations.  Brown was simply rehashing old story lines with different characters and different locations.  While \\"DaVinci\\" and \\"Angels\\" had you guessing, the story of \\"Symbol\\" was easier to see than a 500 pound man in a glaring orange vest in the middle of an LA freeway!  Brown writes in a very readable style and that is a credit to him.  However, if he wishes to continue to engage his readers, he will need to find new storylines and twists that he hasn't used before.  And, for the record, I certainly hope he does.

B0034U4QLM|5.0|I was given San Patricio (Deluxe!) as a gift a few days ago and I have been on a \\"Joy high\\" ever since.  I understand from the previous reviewer that the cd project is described more fully on the cd only page. I feel the story of the battalion of Irish immigrants fighting with the US Army during the Mexican-American war is worth repeating; we didn't read it in any textbooks.  The Irish found themselves unwilling to fight against the Mexicans, largely fellow Catholics; they deserted from the US Army and chose to fight alongside the Mexicans with whom they identified until the inevitably bitter end to the \\"War of Manifest Destiny\\" which gained the US two-thirds of Mexico's territory.  Ry Cooder and Paddy Maloney saw other similarities between the Irish immigrants and today's Mexican immigrants:  Their second-class treatment in the US, similarities of sentiment (love of country, homesickness) and their rich cultural histories.  They invited some well-known Mexican and Chicano artists to collaborate in the making of the cd and dvd, including Los Tigres del Norte, who have been the voice of the Mexican people and Mexican immigrants in the US for over 30 years;  Linda Ronstadt, Lila Downs; the great Chavela Vargas, now in her 80's; and other regional Mexican musicians.  The music is awesome, the dvd is an absolute joy to watch:  Cooder and Maloney discussing the project and serious musicians from different cultures enjoying each other's company and artistry.  BTW: The video on this page (no title) is a delight:  Los Tigres del Norte, accompanied by Ry Cooder and Paddy Maloney of the Chieftans performing the tradition Mexican song, Canción Mixteca.  The video and the artwork on the album feature traditional Mexican elements--La Virgen de Guadalupe and the iconic Loteria cards.  If I had to use just three words to describe San Patricio, they would be Joy, Respect and Brotherhood (which includes sisters).  Most of the music is in Spanish.   I wish Amazon would put a title by the video and promote this cd in its Mexican music section as well as with Lila Downs, Los Tigres del Norte, Chavela Vargas.  San Patricio is crossover... and it's about time.
B000E33VWW|4.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman did a great job in the film though his voice did get annoying over time. Capote writes the book \\"in cold blood\\" and spends lots of his time when not throwing big parties, talking to the convited murders for his book. He seems to fall for the younger convicte since he's always with him but i think in general Capote was a lying turd. Either way, the film was well presented and makes you want to read the book \\"in cold blood\\" somewhat. I know i do.
B00006F2TV|5.0|My son loves this movie. Huge spidey fan. I like the music in it. When I saw that it was Danny Elfman, I was surprised. His music usually has a very \\"small\\" feel to it with limited thematic phrases. This felt much larger. I could tell a difference in his musical growth. Overall, the acting is great and the effects are okay (not near as good as the subsequent movies).
0142000671|5.0|Steinbeck has a great talent of telling a profound story with simple sentences, basic vocabulary, and a straight forward plot. The strength of the story is in great characters and the tone of the story. Not many books have touched my life like this one. It's hard not to feel for Lennie and George and become angry at the world for there being no place for someone like Lennie at that point in time. It's a truly moving story that should be read by everyone at least once.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I love this series! There is so much these days that brings us down. In this series, we watch the characters facing extreme poverty, class snobbery, and all of life's other challenges, while lifting each other up. Well, at times they kick each other around, but in this series even the bad guys are lovable.<br /><br />The series has been compared to a British version of Little House On The Prairie, even down to the name of the main character being Laura. There are a lot of similarities, but it is not just \\"Little House\\" with a British accent.<br /><br />This is a delightful series. One could build a case for its demonstrating values, character, and even leadership roles for women. Oh yes, there's a little romance in there too.<br /><br />I have a couple of negatives about the second season. I think I'll post them separately.
B00007AJF8|5.0|I loved this film. It was great and strange. I loved the 7 1/2 floor and all the characters. It's interesting seeing the changes people have as they be john for 15 mintues. People always want to see what it's like to be someone else and we finally get to see it happen.
B0000029AP|5.0|Awesome, but the one before and after it is a little better. Aerosmith is already in their prime here and they deliver one of their best albums.  The whole band sounds tight and ready to breakout into super stardom and they actually did.    Their three best albums were this Rocks and Get Your Wings, and this is the most musically diverse of the three.  That is not to say that they do not rock on it.  Check out \\"No More No More\\", The title track, \\"Adams Apple\\" and the smash hit \\"Sweet Emotion.\\"  But there is a lot of diversity on this \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" sounds like an old blues tune,  \\"Uncle Salty\\" has a very weird, but cool guitar riff, \\"Round and Round\\"  has some good studio experimentation, a very good power ballad(before they became the norm)\\"You See Me Crying\\", and who could forget the fast talking \\"Walk this Way\\".    The only weakness to Toys is that the album as a whole is a little bit weaker than Get Your Wings or Rocks. But that's just one person's opinion. Check it out, then check out the other two and form your own one.
0375812024|1.0|My family loves Scarry.  I spend probably 40 percent of my day reading Richard Scarry books to my 17 month old, because that's what he loves doing .  I feel like I could find Richard Scarry in a parade, in the dark, with my eyes closed.  Something about this book just ain't right.  The drawings are sloppy and crowded.  They don't obey the laws of physics.  Huckle's dad looks like a knockoff.  The colors are wrong... and lastly, the story just doesn't sound like it's written by the S-Man himself.  Huckle never says, \\"Wow!\\"  Sorry...   we love airplanes but this book is creeping me out.
B002ONC9NC|3.0|\\"An Education\\" is a handsome early 1960s coming-of-age tale, adapted from a true story, that is ultimately not as ambitious as it should be. Jenny (Carey Mulligan) is a 16-year-old schoolgirl, the only child of Jack (Alfred Molina) and Marjorie (Cara Seymour), living in Twickenham, London in 1961. She aspires to read English at Oxford, and her parents seem to think of little else. Caught in the rain with her cello one day, a man named David (Peter Sarsgaard) in a red Bristol sportscar gives her a lift. And then he asks her to a concert. Jenny craves more adventure than her constrained bourgeois life offers, so she jumps at the opportunity to go to nightclubs, European vacations, and the races with David and his friends Danny (Dominic Cooper) and Helen (Rosamund Pike). David's charm even elicits her parents' approval. Predictably, David is not what he seems.<br /><br />This script was written by Nick Hornby from a 2003 article by Lynn Barber in the literary magazine \\"Granta\\". Barber made her name as an interviewer, but in the article she recounted a misadventure she had as a teenager, when she dated an older man named Simon Goldman, who turned out to be a con artist. Barber was less conned by him than her parents, who actually wanted their daughter to marry the man. \\"An Education\\" is so simplified and sanitized that it's better to think of it as fiction. Barber was more assertive and less a victim than her cinematic namesake and Simon more roguish. Barber apparently didn't even like him very much but hung around for the company of Danny and Helen. In the movie, David seems to have no personality and Jenny no edge.<br /><br />I don't object to fictionalizing, but this script is just a very long stay-in-school public service message. Admonitions that Jenny would be \\"ruining her life\\" by marrying instead of going to university are anachronistic. Who would have said that to a young woman in 1961? The film scolds Jenny for choosing a life of adventure over an English degree, which may or may not be wise but hardly has moral implication, while it tiptoes around the fact that she's running with crooks and profiting from their misdeeds. Lynn Barber's story is good material. But Hornby has taken the meat out of it and replaced it with, basically, mush. And preposterous dialogue. It's innocuous, predictable, and rather bland. Alfred Molina is very good as Jenny's domineering but naive father, as is Rosamund Pike as ditzy Helen. But watching the film, I had the persistent feeling that there is something interesting here, but they're telling the wrong story.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2010): \\"The Making of An Education\\" (9 min) is brief interviews with the director, producers, Nick Hornby, and cast, who talk about story, characters, and the film as metaphor for the cultural changes of the 1960s without saying much. \\"Walking the Red Carpet\\" (8 min) is red carpet interviews from the Los Angeles premiere of the film a Grauman's Egyptian Theater. There is an audio commentary with director Lone Scherfig and actors Carey Mulligan and Peter Sarsgaard. It is fairly constant but not very technical. They recall shooting the film, comment on the scenes, and occasionally talk about a technical challenge. There are also 11 deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer (2 1/2 min).

0739319175|1.0|This book was really bad. I was glad that I bought it for my Kindle rather than shelling out the cover price of $30.00. This book is so poorly written that it's actually painful to read. I couldn't muster up a lick of concern for any of the characters. Dan Brown is much more interested in telling a story and throwing in bits of arcane knowledge than actually writing a good book with compelling characters.  Brown's characters are flat. We have no past with them and little reason to care about them. The plot is completely  implausible so it doesn't take much to guess where the story's going.  The villain is little more than a cartoon character. I was reading aloud to my husband during a car trip and he thought I was embellishing the character for comedic purposes. Unfortunately I was not. And just when one thinks the story is going to end, it doesn't. And doesn't. And still doesn't. And when the symbol is was revealed at long last, all I could think was,  \\"Seriously, Dan Brown? You have got to be kidding!\\" because I'd already guessed the answer, but had excluded it because it was trite.     Angels and Demon's was pretty good. The DaVinci code was okay.  The Lost Symbol is bad. It's trite, flat, predictable and not very inventive. If you've got to read it then borrow it from someone; don't actually buy it. If you must buy it, then buy it used, in horrible condition. The story is barely worth the cost to ship it.  I hope he doesn't write another one.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I watched this movie with my family and we ALL loved it!  It's a wonderful story of taking chances in life and of having love and trust.  Yes, some may say it's full of clich&eacute;, but who cares?  It's hard to find a true story in today's cynical world with such a happy ending!  I know it's about a black child being adopted by a white family, but I didn't see it as a racial movie.  I saw it as a child overcoming enormous obstacles in his young life to remain a decent human being, and I also saw a remarkable woman who took a chance on that boy.  Great script with great acting makes a great movie!  Sandra, you go girl!  You deserved that Oscar!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a totally touching movie! A must have for any animal lover. Be prepared to have tissues near by. You will definately need them!!
B00275EGX8|3.0|Fast shipping on a just ok movie. Not sure why it won so many awards really.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I heard high reviews for this movie, and though that I would get it and watch it.  I was not happy with the turn out of the movie and yes we all wish Hitler had died that but that was not the case.  I am give it 4 stars for the action, but over all the plot I would have to give it a 2 1/2 stars.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|I saw the 360 tour live in Virginia, and then a little while later the live streaming on YouTube.  Just an amazing concert, great song selection, wonderful visuals.  I can only imagine how good this is going to look on the big TV playing on Blu-ray.<br /><br />The great thing about this stage, isn't just how good it looks, and how well it showcases the band, but also the design features a bunch of mobile high definition cameras all over the place.  These should have recorded enough footage to really capture this concert well.  The live edits for the YouTube concert were impressive, but given time, I'm sure they have taken it to the next level.<br /><br />If you like U2 even a little bit, I don't think you'd be disappointed by this purchase.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|Great movie, came in \\"new\\" packing and worked great. A bit on the late side for shipping, but it got here.[[ASIN:B001OQCV2O 2012 (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]]
B001UW58WW|5.0|Fabulous!!!  David Garrett is outstanding.  His music takes you to a different place.  Get this CD!!!
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Modern Family is one of my favorite shows on television right now.  It deals with the \\"modern\\" family in a way that is fresh, relevant, and hysterically funny.  Each episode is better than the next.  I find myself laughing out loud, something I don't usually do with the crap that's on television right now.  I can't wait for this to come out on DVD, I'll be buying it with the quickness!!
B001OQCV2O|4.0|Lots of action keeps your attention throughout the whole movie. Special effects are amazzing on Blu-Ray.
B001GWUBSC|4.0|I've seen some of the negative reviews on the series that lamented the lack of historical accuracy.  This series is meant to be entertainment and it certainly is.  Lots of sex, political intrigue, and beautiful costumes make for a great escape.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|.  .  I'm sorry, not much to review here, zap me with thumbs down here it you'd like...    If you haven't seen it don't.  The movie is down right insulting to your intelligence.  I can agree with all the bad reviews here.
B000LXHK22|5.0|Top 5 reasons that this movie is a keeper:    (1) Visually stunning       This is the first movie that the modern London looked \\"unattractive\\", unlike the Matchpoint by Woddy Allen. Provence, France, by contrast, featured a chateau with beautiful vines and sunset glow on beautiful trees. Dinners around the pool featuring live band and silent movie. Water mouthing hoem cooked dinner at the tenant's house.    (2) Marion Cotillard as Fanny Chenal      Young, beautiful, hot and intelligent with a great wardrobe. She acted so natural and confidently. The film lighted up when she appeared on the screen.    (3) Great bonding between Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) and young Max (Freddie Highmore)     Chess, tennis, cricket, how to win and lose, all you need to know about red wine    (4) A script with surprising twists    I like the way that the clues (Uncle Henry's will, the job at London, the expensive wine maker of the Lost Corner, the words whispered into young Max's ears) which were unfolded in the last 10 minutes    (5) Interesting supporting characters     The secretary(Archie Panjabi, Bend it like Beckham), the tenant Duflot(Didier Bourdon) and the Secretary (Tome Hollander, Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice)     At the end, it is Marion Cotillard which is the decisive factor why Max (Russel Crowe) could go back to France. She would have played Elizabeth so well in the modern version of Pride and Prejudice.
B0001WTWCO|1.0|Would someone please tell me what this movie is about?  I tried watching it several times, but fell asleep long before the ending each time.<br /><br />One great thing about this movie...It's allowed me to throw-away my Ambien pills.<br /><br />Probably one of the worst five movies I've ever watched.  Watching flies crawling up my drapes is more watchable.

B000093BDX|5.0|Ahhhhhhhh...Sounds Of Summer...The Very Best Of The Beach Boys...<br /><br />This 30-track CD is outstanding.  It contains virtually all of the big hits of The Beach Boys.  If you're looking for just a \\"greatest hits\\" type of album by this band, then this is the album for you.  Loaded with classics from the '60s and beyond, this CD will help you stay upbeat and think about fun, sun, beaches, surfing, convertibles, drive-ins, starry nights, everything that is summer.  Not to mention a simpler, safer, more innocent and more prosperous period of time in history - a direct contrast to today's world.<br /><br />Some of the big hits on this collection are \\"California Girls\\", \\"I Get Around\\", \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Good Vibrations\\", \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\", \\"Surfin' Safari\\", \\"Surfer Girl\\", \\"In My Room\\", \\"Barbara Ann\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"Kokomo\\" and many others.<br /><br />If you want to get into the summer frame of mind and keep your sunny disposition, then this collection is your fuel.  Highly recommended.
1439190275|5.0|Imaginary science or not ... I was declined by a insurance company for life insurance due to poor blood profile test results placing me at risk for heart disease.  On the recommendation of my family physician, I was advised to be on a low fat, high complex carb diet, the blood profile got worse in a month at which time he wanted to put me on medication.  I decided to try the Atkins diet; within a month, my blood profile was back in normal range.  As a side effect, I lost over 40 lbs in about 9 months.  I was no longer feeling tired and sleepy after lunch hour.  Friends and family commented that I looked younger and I definitely felt a better sense of overall well being.     The New Atkins For a New You is a great, well detailed book confirming once again of Dr. Atkins work, it is easy to understand and well researched.    This way of eating was not really difficult after the first week when I got over the sugar and junk food cravings.  I do try to stick with organic meats and vegetables, I used butter, coconut and extra virgin olive oil.      People do need to understand that if you wish to follow this diet, you CANNOT eat the sugar and junk food in addition to the higher fat, higher protein combination which is what make most of us overweight and unwell at the first place.      As my own doctor indicated to me, blood test results do not lie.  Anyone writing a negative review should really take the time to look at the research available.  It is your health, be proactive, don't just follow any advice blindly.
0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown tries to throw out red herrings but only manages to create a plot that strangles itself.   I kept asking myself, \\"Why am I still reading this?\\"  Every character is a professor of Gnosticism and must spend incredible amounts of time preaching lectures.  The reader knows far in advance of the character what will happen even when the outcome in obvious.  While Dan Brown is incredibly knowledgeable about history and obscure locations and has written good books in the past, I wish he would have spent more time developing a good story.

0143038583|5.0|This is a very worthwhile book. A lot of it is not new to those of us who think about food and its relationship to the world.  But it is well told and full of insight that enriches that thinking and examples and metaphors that flesh it out.  For example do you know how many calories, of fossil fuel energy it takes to produce a calorie of corn energy under our industrial agriculture system? I forget, but its in the book and its a depressing number, especially considering that the actual calorie of corn energy was a free gift from the sun and the corn plant.  If you don't have some idea of the unsustainable fuel guzzling industrial food chain, then this book will be a revelation to you.    However, the book is more than just anti-industrial food.  In fact, I don't know that it is anti-anything.  It just describes and meditates on these things. It does not solve any problems.  You come away with a deeper understanding of the world as it is and our place in it as big smart omnivorous animals.  Like all the rest of the animals we came up through evoltionary history on the abundant free lunch that the sun supplied and that plants made available directly to us and through food animals that also ate plants.  Now we find ourselves dependent on an industrial food chain based on productivity cranked through the roof by petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides.  And that is a real bargain with the devil.  Humanity's numbers may have already grown to the point that we are addicted to that food chain as moral creatures in that to abandon it would be let certain populations starve to death.  At the same time, there are alternatives that offer some hope, or at least offer individuals healthy, flavorful food with integrity.  One can even still hunt and gather one's food in a way that pay's tribute to the ten or 20 thousand generations that lived this way.  The books last chapters conclude by capturing some of the inherent joy and satisfaction of hunting and gathering and preparingand consuming our food.  That satisfaction is the joy of participating in the world, because, as the last line of the book says: \\"...we eat by the grace of nature, not industry, and what we're eating is never anything more or less than the body of the world.\\"  I could not have said it better.  I can't wait to read Botany of Desire.
0061537969|4.0|This is a sweet and sad story about a man (Denny) and his dog (Enzo). The story is narrated by the dog so, when Denny meets and marries Eve and they later have a daughter, Zoe, you get to see these major changes in Denny's life through the eyes of the one who knows him best. Having the dog narrate the story is brilliant...you can be so creative with it because, after all, who really KNOWS what a dog is thinking?<br /><br />Enzo loves racing and he loves to watch TV. Denny started leaving the TV on for Enzo to keep him company while Denny was at work, so Enzo learns many things this way--about racing, about the world and about life. He is a very wise dog! But it bugs him sometimes that he's a dog and not a man. He believes that in his next life, he WILL be a man, and he feels that he is completely ready for the challenge.<br /><br />I loved Denny & Enzo's relationship, especially that Denny talks to Enzo. Without giving away the story, there is much sadness and frustration in the story, but the only part I found weepy was at the end (and that was a doozy).<br /><br />I would have had no problem giving this book 5 stars if the book were less about car racing.<br /><br />Recommended for all dog owners and racing fans (even moreso if you are both).
7883708813|5.0|Beauty in the Beast is my favorite animated movie, but I think Pinocchio might be the best animated movie of all time. It's just perfect. Walt Disney's second animated feature lenth film after Snow White combines superb animation with a real soul of life. In a timeless story of a puppet coming of age, Pinocchio learns harsh lessons of temptation in a world of cruel characters, and eventually finds what's really most important. The richness of characters like Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio's creator Gappetto, and a host of charismatic bad guys, just makes this film a special one.     The DVD is a terrific restoration of picture and sound quality. It has a nice second disk of extra features, but the movie is what this is all about. A classic in every sense of the word.

B002EA4IO8|5.0|I believe the ending of this book would give most people night mares. Other than that, It is well written and keeps your attention.
B001FB55L2|2.0|First of all I must say the acting from all the primary characters was masterful. The story content however was depressing and fell short at the end. If you're looking for a movie depicting how war makes people do terrible things and ruins families, this is it. If you're looking for something about working thru hard times and pulling thru together, plan to be disappointed. All in all the story felt incomplete. Jake G's character was getting close to being more than an ex-con but never quite got there, ended as a jerk trying to be better. Toby M's actions as a prisoner were inexcusable and dishonorable and not suprisingly haunted him at home. My father was a WWII vet and I am certain down to my toes that he would have died before taking the life of a fellow American soldier to save his own. Fear and being a hostage does strange things to people but Toby's character lost it for me when he took that step. Natalie P's character never quite crosses the line into infidelity but just skirts it, so the love triangle the film leads you to expect falls flat. Good for her but made the movie more of a dud. The story ends on a downturn with Toby M in military custody, mentally unstable and Natalie willing to stay by his side though he can't commit to anything. Overall just plain depressing to watch. Movies don't have to be all hearts and flowers for me to enjoy them, I love a good Clint Eastwood crime flick. Brothers left me irritated with the characters,too many unresolved issues and with nothing positive,no honor at the end. It doesn't really end either, it just stops. At least Clint gets the bad guys in his movies. In Brothers, the good guys turned into bad guys. If it had gone farther, had Toby apologise to the family he destroyed or man-up in court for his actions,it could have been so much better. I'd much rather watch \\"Band Of Brothers\\" about real ordinary guys, real hero's. Wish I had rented this instead of buying, doubt I will ever watch it again.

B0017JKEL8|5.0|Seeing season 1 for a second time, especially after seeing the even better season 2, really made me appreciate it more since I knew the characters more intimately and was no longer having those initial reactions to the characters' bad behavior. The picture quality on the blu-ray is far superior to the DVD, though it does have a few quirks that are a product of the transfer. The sound is better as well, allowing the sound design to breathe more openly.    I did experience a bad copy of a first disc where the image froze for almost a minutes length on episode 3, but Amazon was good enough to replace it right away. No technical problems the second time around. One thing I appreciate about Amazon is they don't make you send the defective copy back before they send you a replacement. I was able to hold onto both copies in case any more glitches occurred, having a back-up replacement at the ready.

1416550550|5.0|This is the story of three women in three different time periods.  Eliza in the early 1900's, Nell in the mid 1970's and Cassandra in the mid 2000's.  It starts with 4 year old Nell being alone on a ship to Australia and the story is about finding out why she was abandoned and who left her there.  That's just the basic premise of the book, but the story is so much more.  The writing is so good you truly feel you are in the times and places that the characters are. A lot of the book takes place in Cornwall, England and the writing is so descriptive, I really feel like I know what it's like there.  The atmosphere is just perfect for the story.  There are lots of extra characters - friends, family members, neighbors, etc. and they are all really interesting to read about. There are 2 interesting men who are main characters in the book also - both kind of dark and mysterious. The book is pretty long, and it took me probably 3 weeks to finish it when I can normally finish a book a week.  There was not one part of the book I wanted to rush through - every word was just perfect.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was very pleasantly suprised with the quality and effort and thought that went into this album. i would definately buy more albums as they are made. a fine product.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I like inspiring films when they are not too mushy. Thank goodness this is the case with this film, which is not afraid to show some rougher parts of Michael Oher's life, such as his past, his mother, and his worthless neighbors.  Big Mike has no home and is not doing well with high school until a woman and her family take him in and treat him like an adopted son.  He is encouraged to play football, gets a good tutor, and...well, I would not want to ruin what happens.  Let's just say that good things do happen and there truly are some decent and honorable people still left in the world.   Refreshing.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Probably the most listened to album of all musical albums on my iPod.  SOOOO many songs and all of them are just awesome.  I don't think you will see an output of such quantity and quality from another musical act in a long time.
B001HN694K|4.0|For someone who is not a big fan of the story \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" I am surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. In Tim Burton's film, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is all grown up and escapes from an unwanted marriage proposal by falling down a rabbit hole and returning to the strange world she visited during her childhood. The kingdom is in peril, suffering under the rule of the Red Queen (played brilliantly by Helena Bonham Cater, who is by far the best part of the movie). Alice encounters many old friends, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), who attempts to help Alice slay the Red Queen's Jabberwocky and save the kingdom.<br /><br />This is a very good film. The story is clever and the cast is very good, with the exception of Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. (Her idea of acting in this film is keeping her arms raised above her head the entire time. So annoying.) I saw the movie in 3D, which is something I didn't think I would enjoy but actually did. Instead of being a distraction, the 3D effects just served to make Alice's world look even stranger.<br /><br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" still isn't my favorite fairy tale, but this new and improved version is much more enjoyable than the original Disney cartoon, and I recommend seeing it in the theatre for the 3D experience.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I disagree with alot of his point of view about who is good and who is bad. However, this movie is fast paced and very entertaining and not too boring. I wish he can put more cartoon in his movie like the clip in Bowling for Columbine.

0465092764|4.0|As with most things related to quantum physics even the title of the book, \\"Not Even Wrong\\" by Peter Woit, is hard to understand.  When dealing with things that don't behave intuitively, as is the case with quantum physics, and on the brink of human understanding, clarity is critical. Nevertheless, physicists always seem to revel in their own intellect and have little regard for those of us who don't share their higher IQs.  Woit seems different notwithstanding his choice of title for this book.  The purpose of this book was to write down in one place the case against string theory and the monolithic institution of researchers and worshipers of the theory that grew up in the shadow, or on the coat tails, of Ed Witten.  Woit does this by giving us a short history of theoretical and experimental particle physics that begat quantum theory, the standard model, and with Ed Witten's help, string theory.  This is all very clear and tracks very well, and of course necessary to understand the criticisms he later levies against string theory in general and the M-Theory that was to follow.<br /><br />First a word on understandability:  When I took second year physics in college -- electromagnetic theory --  and experienced imaginary numbers, flux, phases, transformations and triple integrals for the first time I had to wonder if any of it was truly understood.  Of course my professor spoke with a deep Czechoslovakian accent which made the lectures even harder to understand.  Day in and day out he would stand in front of the room with his back to the class and lecture to the chalk-board filling every available inch of space with a flurry of equations.  One day he was absent and his wife took over the lecture. In some strange episode of synchronicity, his wife stood in front of the classroom, with her back to us, and in a deep Czechoslovakian accent lectured to the chalk-board filling every available inch of space with a flurry of equations.  The class felt as if we had just experienced a breach in time-space and with perfect symmetry as the professors' anti-matter component slipped into our room for the day.  This is difficult stuff.  It takes a great deal of study to understand the very simple let alone the highly complex.  In some cases, as Woit points out, even the experts get fooled due to lack of understanding or interest in taking the necessary time, and pain, to gain more than a general sense of the topic.  Decades later I understand all too well, that I will never truly understand what is being discussed in Woit's book or any number of texts on the subject that I might open.  Nevertheless, I gave it a try and have come away with a few insights I feel are worth noting in my review.<br /><br />First, Woit really only has a single point to make, albeit an extremely powerful point.  The fact is that after two full decades of research into string theory, not a single prediction coming out of the theory can be confirmed experimentally.  To me, a book isn't necessary to convey this message, it's pretty simple.  His deeper message, and his second important point, is that a book was indeed necessary because after years of screaming into the abyss with no one is hearing his message too many resources have been and continue to be wasted in pursuit of a theory that ceases to be scientific.  Theory, no matter how beautiful it might be in the eye of the beholder is no more than mental masturbation without experimental results confirming something, anything, not, as has been the case with string theory, nothing, zip, zero, zilch, nada, butt-kiss.  So whereas I may not understand exactly how a 1-dimensional closed loop of energy vibrates across 10 or 11 dimensions of space and time, six or more of those dimensions are so small we can't see them thus we don't need to worry about them, I do understand that I shouldn't believe you even though I can't do the math myself.  Science ceases to be scientific when the hypothesis cannot be proven.  For thisinsight Woit is highly effective and should be thanked for trying to make this simple message clear.  Has his message been heard?  I heard him, I can only hope the next generation of quantum physicists hear him before investing a life-time in pursuit of a science that is not scientific.it is highly effective and should be thanked for trying to make this simple message clear.

B0000C8AVM|5.0|I purchased the remastered version, which has a deeper, warmer sound than the previous version. If you like Bob and sound is important, I wouldn't think twice about buying this CD.
0066620996|5.0|I read this book as part of a leadership class I am taking and to be honest, I was dreading reading it.  However, it was very interesting and grabbed me by the end of the first chapter and I enjoyed every page of this informative book.  I applaud Jim Collins and his team on the incredibly detailed comparisons that were used as examples of companies that went from good companies to great ones and what it took for those companies to achieve greatness.  If I ever find myself in a situation to help make leadership decisions I will definitely remember what I learned from this book.  I highly recommend you read this book if you are in a position of leadership within your company, or ever plan on working your way to the top!
B001OQCV6A|3.0|The Amazon summary of this movie is pretty accurate.  I'll translate as, if you're from the \\"less is more\\" school of thought about movies, flee from \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" as fast as you can.  Watson as a martial-arts expert?  Riiight.  Victorian England as a setting for a slam-bang action movie?  Who would have thought?  Robert Downey is Holmes and Jude Law is Watson, investigating a megalomaniac member of Parliament who is heavily into the Dark Arts and a serial killer.  The acting is solid throughout, production values strong, and the plot intriguing, but the totally over-the-top action ultimately loses its punch and becomes mind-numbing.  I enjoyed it anyway, but having seen the trailer beforehand, knew what to expect.
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|From the first note you stand amazed.  There are three things that do this.      First, the absolute professionalism of the musicians: They were not there to goof around for 90 minutes.  They were there, after 14 years out of the public eye, to introduce themselves to the next generation. And every song is so perfect it sounds like the original on an album you may own.  Even a NON-musician can see that these men are the best in their field at playing and vocals.      Second, (and the best reason to buy the video) are the camera angles.  MTV nailed this in the production room.  They have high roaming cameras zipping back and forth across the stage and they catch everything, like Frey giving Felder the eye for walking away from the front too much during Take It Easy!  The camera keeps this video interesting.      Third, the digital sound.  The base is earth rattling if you have the system.  Excellent music quality on a live performance.  You can drop this in your home theater system and let it play all day like a CD - its that flawless in music reproduction.   Thank you MTV, you have given us something that can last forever and could have not been done better.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Many have by now forgotten this movie; the controversy surrounding it may have defused any desire to see it on the part of those who are not believers in Jesus the Christ.  It's too bad, because the picture it gives is deeply rooted in history - unless, of course, you believe that the New Testament accounts are fairy tales with no basis in history.  If so, you may have no interest.  But the dramatic power of the story and the historical accuracy with which it is presented have a power of their own, no matter what you believe.  It is interesting that this movie was attacked for its anti-Semitism.  To a person with no axe to grind either way, it would seem that if Jesus was NOT the Messiah, then indeed he was a blasphemer and a troublemaker par excellence, and the Jewish hierarchy were doing the right thing to get rid of him.  If he was the Messiah, then this same hierarchy was playing a dangerous game, and the earthquakes and general destruction that followed his death were a sign that perhaps his kingdom truly was not of this world...and not a rational thing, either.    The hierarchs who fuel the cry for his crucifixion are above all rational men, who see where their power lies, and know how to maintain it.  There are several of the hierarchy who disagree, but they are shouted down.  All along, there are those on both sides (Romans and Jews) whose hearts are moved, and who are horrified by the brutality of what happens.  So it certainly cannot be said that the Jews en masse are to be blamed, as was wrongly said by many ignorant people in the Church during medieval times and later, who used this as an excuse to persecute Jesus' people.  If Jesus said, \\"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do,\\" then it is indeed the Christians who have failed to follow Jesus' example.  The true guilt lies here.  Each of us during Holy Week should watch this movie and see what the results of lack of forgiveness are.  Teachings of forgiveness and mercy are not unique to the NewTestament, they are there in the Torah/Pentateuch if one's eyes are open.  The Jewish people who went like lambs to the slaughter of the Holocaust are heirs of Jesus, even if they did not believe in his identity as the Messiah.  And we Christians have been in the shoes of the Romans who drove in the nails.   If hearts are open to it, this movie could bring much peace to the world.  Peace is never brought by ignoring violence but by confronting, even, if necessary, submitting to it, and forgiving it - which is the only thing, ultimately, that touches men's hearts.
B001QOGYFO|2.0|When a movie panders to the star's appeal in one useless elongated opening shower scene, you should know what to expect ahead. Kate's tough gal schtick ran out its welcome not long after she opened her mouth.     The unimaginative appearances of the killer, red herring, trap hole, mind-(D)umbing final twist and the 'whiteout', GEEZ.... can these elements be more stupifying cinematically in their timing? Then again, this is the same uber-auteur for Gone in 60 Seconds and Swordfish.    One star for the Antarctica setting and one star for the scientists who ran across the pond naked. Who said geeks can't party? Too bad I didnt while watching this, maybe I would have blacked out this crapola.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|So I have been a Gorillaz fan since their first album came out in 2001, and have loved every one that they have put out.  But I have to say, this one has got to be their best yet.<br /><br />As much as I love [[ASIN:B00082IJ08 Demon Days]] and [[ASIN:B00005LMBK Gorillaz]], Plastic Beach has just put the group over the top.  With an inventive nautical theme to the album and some great beats, lyrics, and guests, this just has to be their best yet.<br /><br />Highlights of the album:<br /><br />Track 2 - Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach - Getting Snoop Dogg involve with this album was a great idea.  Not only will this increase the presence of Gorillaz in the U.S., but it will show that Gorillaz can collaborate with any artists.  I did have my doubts when I heard that Snoop Dogg was on the album, but his style works great with this track.<br /><br />Tracks 4 and 7 - Rhinestone Eyes and Empire Ants - These 2 tracks have the best vocals from 2D on them, and the lyrics are amazing.  The music and beats for Rhinestone Eyes are just so powerful, while Empire Ants starts off very calm and beautiful and escalates to some great beats for Little Dragon's section of the song.<br /><br />Tracks 5 and 15 - Stylo and Cloud of Unknowing - Bringing in an old school R & B artist like Bobby Womack further makes this album shine.  His vocals on both tracks are very different but amazing.  In Stylo, it's that R & B style that comes from the deepest part and it's like Bobby is screaming to get his message out.  For Cloud of Unknowing, Bobby takes it down and it is the type of R & B vocals that are more mellow, but still hit your heart with just as great of force as in Stylo.<br /><br />Track 6 - Superfast Jellyfish - De La Soul is back for another album and they deliver again.  This is the most fun song on the album, but it does have a big message attached to it, mainly about how our culture is eating very unhealthy fast foods and foods with artificial ingredients that are not good for us.<br /><br />Track 9 - Some Kind of Nature - I just love Lou Reed's gruffly vocals on this song.  They work extremely well with the music for this track, which is very fun at times like Superfast Jellyfish, but fit Reed's vocal.  The lyrics for this song are also fun and interesting, and 2D's backing vocals are nice as well.  Again, another great guest for this album.<br /><br />Track 13 - Plastic Beach - This song is not only the title track for the album, but the great thing about it is the guitar and bass guitar at the beginning of the song by The Clash's Mick Jones and Paul Simonon.  You can just hear the greatest of their playing styles and how much of an influence The Clash still has on many artists today.  It's really awesome as well that they have joined the touring band for Gorillaz for Phase 3.<br /><br />So, if you have never listened to Gorillaz before, or you didn't like their previous albums, this one is going to be different.  There is more blending of several different music styles and there is at least one track (in my opinion) that every one will love.<br /><br />If you haven't gotten this album yet, do so now!  You will not regret it!  If you don't have [[ASIN:B00082IJ08 Demon Days]] and [[ASIN:B00005LMBK Gorillaz]] yet, get those as well so you can compare each album separately and make your decision on which is the best album.  But for me, this is the best yet!ust love Lou Reed's gruffly vocals on this song.

B0035V35P8|4.0|I've wanted to see this movie for a long time, and finally got the chance.  I wasn't disappointed.  This is an action packed film the brings the ninja genre into the 21st century and makes the first Kill Bill look like a PG-13 film when it comes to gore.<br /><br />This movie goes a fine job of exploring the ninja mythos and paying homage to the genre.<br /><br />Bloody fine entertainment.
B0039UTDFG|1.0|I give it ZERO stars! I purchased Planet Earth bluray, have Blue planet, plus many single Blu Ray outdoor shows (over Alaska, Australia, underwater and such.) I tried to watch the Life series on HDTV but Oprah's narration of this kind of show just ruined it for me, 100% does NOT work! If they are trying to attract more black people into these \\"Earth\\" shows and they think it has to be narrated by a black person, WHY Oprah? We know if Oprah was outside and saw a bug, she would start screaming and drop her wig while flailing her arms running in circles.     Why could they not get Morgan Freeman or the great James Earl Jones to narrate Life?? Sigourney did the Planet Earth and she did a very good job but not as good as Attenborough-the version I purchased. At least Sigourney Weaver has become an activist and honorary chair of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International and fights for animal rights.     I cannot in any way, understand how anyone thought Oprah's persona and voice fits this type of series. (Did they hire someone from NBC to make that decision?) I see that Attenborough narrated a British version. Maybe I can find Attenborough's Life version here in the states. I will not buy \\"Life\\" with Oprah's narration, even for 1$.  If I cannot get Attenborough's version, then they can keep it. Hey. that's Life.. (But I think James Earl Jones could have been a better narrator than even Attenborough.)
B000089RW0|5.0|This underrated film of a ship found adrift at sea is a blend of modern horror and old-fashioned storytelling. It moves the familiar haunted house story to the ocean with more emphasis on atmosphere and story than most present day horror films. Other than a somewhat gory opening scene the viewer must see as background, there is an understated old-style atmosphere and performances which works well.<br /><br />When a close-knit salvage crew led by Gabriel Byrne agree to go treasure hunting based on photos of an unknown ship drifting deep in the remote Bering Sea, they have no idea what lies ahead. Even the hardened Murphy (Byrne), who has seen strange things at sea, is shocked when what appears and disappears in the dark chilly sea on their radar screens turns out to be the Italian luxury liner Antonia Graza, drifting like a dark and elegant ghost. She is a maritime mystery, vanishing without explanation or trace decades before.<br /><br />Epps (Julianne Marguiles) is the first of the crew to realize something onboard is very wrong, when she sees a sweet young girl who cannot possibly be there. Director Steve Beck does a nice job capturing for the viewer the sense of eerie wonder and anticipation exploring a dark, drifting ship deep in the ocean, thousands of miles from nowhere, brings. As the crew begin to explore the Graza, tension builds and we feel a sense of doom. So does the crew, but just when they are ready to boogie out of there, gold is found, and keeps them aboard.<br /><br />The elegance and style of the original voyage is nicely captured in flashbacks, and adds dimension to the dreary present day salvage operation. Despite the fact this is a horror film of sorts, it is set design rather than special effects which drive it, and make it fun to watch. Marguiles does a nice job, as does Italian beauty Francesca Rettondini in her much too brief flashbacks. Emily Browning, as the young Katie, trying to protect Epps and her crew because she is not like the \\"others\\" is very good also.<br /><br />The gory flashback which opens the film is more shocking than bloody, but still way too much for younger audiences. It does, however, add to the adult viewer's enjoyment of the story in a way, giving the moviegoer empathy for young Katie's tragic fate. Picked off one by one, she may be the only hope for the remaining. The story has style and is told in an old-fashioned manner. While some elements may be predictable, it is done with understatement and visual flair, making it a fun film in the genre for those who enjoy a good story..

B000002MK8|4.0|I will never err in classifying this intimate live showcase in the same league as 1971's masterpiece \\"Every Picture Tells A Story\\". But it might be no accident that he revives half that album when he was at the peak of his credibility.<br /><br />22 years later, that raspy voice retains its magic and he is greatly assisted by a back-to-basics band that revisits his blues and folk roots from back in the day. Yet this product feels a bit trendy as a whole. The two oldies covers of the Impressions and Sam Cooke are banal. Trying to cover Tom Waits is a misstep. And \\"Have I Told You Lately\\" holds little appeal and confirms my belief that this song will always belong the Van the Man.<br /><br />Still it's nice that he resurrects some old chestnuts. And the three exceptional numbers in this setting, \\"Handbags and Gladrags\\", \\"Reason to Believe\\" and \\"Highgate Shuffle\\" have me wondering if he's ever done any better. These really get down to his early essence.
B00009W0WM|5.0|\\"And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?\\" -- Renault<br /><br />\\"My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.\\" -- Rick<br /><br />\\"The waters? What waters? We're in the desert!\\" -- Renault<br /><br />\\"I was misinformed.\\" -- Rick<br /><br />Any film buff watching this screen classic today will certainly get a sense of having seen this formula over and over. Howard Hawks remade it in a fashion, and actually improved upon it by putting his distinct spin on it, in To Have and Have Not. While it often gets overpraised because it is a beloved favorite of critics, it also doesen't receive the credit due it. The four strongest performances here, namely Bogart, Rains, Lorre, and Joy Page, who rarely even gets a mention, didn't garner the Academy Award. It can be argued that any solid studio director from this period could have made a great film out of the terrific screenplay worked on by many but credited to Howard Koch and Julius and Philip Epstein, and the fine cast assembled. But it is a film which is more than the sum of its parts, and the reason why it has been copied so often over the years.<br /><br />Bogart is Rick Blaine, doing okay running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca, in French Morocco. Everyone must go through Casablanca to get to Lisbon, and freedom from the turmoil brought about by Hitler's ever growing expansion. Rick runs his cafe and gambling house unencumbered by politics, looking out only for himself and a few close and loyal employees like Sam (Dooley Wilson) and Carl (S.Z. Sakall). Peter Lorre is marvelous as the criminal who worships Rick, and seeks his approval. It is really what happens to Ugarte (Lorre) which turns Rick against the Nazi's and for the French Resistance, though it won't become evident until the film is nearly over. It is perhaps, the most interesting relationship in the film, made more so since Lorre meets his end early on.<br /><br />Ugarte leaves Rick a letter of transit which can't even be questioned, when in pops Rick's reason for hiding out in Casablanca; Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Rick's bitter disillusionment with love all goes back to what happened in Paris, where Ilsa left him holding his heart in his hand. The montages were in part directed by Don Siegel, who would direct Mitchum and Greer in The Big Steal, and later become well known for Dirty Harry with Clint Eastwood. Ilsa isn't alone, however, bringing with her her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). He is the lead figure behind the movement to rid the French of the Third Reich. They would prefer he never make it to Lisbon. Caught in between is the pragmatic Captain Renault (Claude Rains). He gives a terrific performance, full of humor and larceny. It is never clear which side he is on. Ilsa wants her husband Victor to escape with his life but Rick isn't so ready to hand over those transit papers; not without some graveling and an explanation for the way he was burned by her.<br /><br />Perhaps Bergman was a good second choice for Ilsa after all. The viewer knows she's messed Rick up, and wants it to be righted, while at the same time sensing they don't belong together. Her casting and lack of chemistry with Bogart makes the ending easier to take for me. Before we get there, however, there are some terrific moments from Joy Page as a young wife fleeing Bulgaria and desperate to get she and her husband out of Casablanca. What Rick does to help her out, and get around her making a mistake with Renault, shows the effect Ugarte's killing by the Germans had on him. Rick is at heart a softhearted romantic, which is why he was cut so deeply by Ilsa's getting over on him in Paris. There was a reason, however, and once he knows what it is, he'll come to the same decision the viewer has.<br /><br />Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Screenplay, and Direction (Michael Curtiz). Bogart would have won for Best Actor, Rains for Supporting Actor, and Joy Page for Best Supporting Actress in a different timeand place. While this isn't the Noir masterpiece many describe it as, it is one amazingly smooth blend of genres which pleases everyone, and makes it one of the great films of all-time. Silent film fans might even catch a glimpse of star Monte Blue as an uncredited American. Bogart and Bergman fans can enjoy watching this over and over, as it is one of those films almost universally cherished by movie lovers.and place.

B000000XCH|5.0|The two greatest attributes that rock and roll embodies are fun and as a useful tool of communication. This album attests to both these principles in spades. This could almost be called a self-contained greatest hits album. Three double A-sided singles comprise this package: \\"Travelin' Band\\"/\\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\", \\"Up Around The Bend\\"/\\"Run Through The Jungle\\" and \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\"/\\"Long As I Can See The Light\\". Each of these songs are masterworks and offer glimpses of Creedence's scope.<br /><br />But the greatness of this album is already evidenced on the opening track, \\"Ramble Tamble\\". On sheer music alone, this track should be the highway anthem to usurp \\"Born To Be Wild\\" (though I love that song too). Listen as the lengthy-but-hypnotic mid-section riff subtly rises in intensity before being brought back down for the finale. Then absorb its few lyrics about daily troubles at home and in Washington D.C. This is their buried anthem.<br /><br />Moreover, what you notice on the whole record is the playing. Stu Cooke, Doug Clifford and Tom Fogerty really become an integral part of the band. But the hero, unsurprisingly, is John Fogerty. His growling tenor is brimming with confidence and his lead guitar work peaks here.<br /><br />The three roots-rock cover tunes, \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" is a blues so thoughtfully arranged that it manages to surpass its master Bo Diddley, Arthur Crudup's \\"My Baby Left Me\\" sounds so authentic that it almost has more of a Sun Studio feel than Elvis Presley's version and Roy Orbison's \\"Ooby Dooby\\" is effective rockabilly slotting in beautifully into the context of the whole.<br /><br />And now for the Motown cover. Or is it?  They radically rework \\"I Heard It Through The Grapevine\\" into a fun, garage-style blues jam. All eleven minutes of this is positive pleasure. Just hear Stu's bass on this one!<br /><br />John Fogerty could really articulate his guitar when required. Listen to those noises on the intro and outro to \\"Run Through The Jungle\\". How appropos. Then, of course, there's his blistering axe on the balls-out rock and roll of \\"Travelin' Band\\". And on \\"Up Around The Bend\\" (another highway anthem) his slide hooks you in for a joyride.<br /><br />But Fogerty's songwriting and vocals are equally central to this record. Every one of his melodies are catchy. On \\"Travelin Band\\", Fogerty has never sung so ferociously. Yet on \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" his voice is reflective, almost surreal, like its lyrical contents. \\"Long As I Can See The Light\\" is a spiritual love song by way of R&B. These two songs seem to have more personal overtones than anything he's written before. As for his political stance, \\"Who'll Stop The Rain\\" and \\"Run Through The Jungle\\" are timeless elaborations.<br /><br />Fogerty expands the instrumentation with piano, sax and dobro ever so sparingly so as not to betray Creedence's trademark sound. He successfully brings that synthesis of 1950's blues, rockabilly, R&B, pop and rock into 1970. And his production is masterfully economical. And the best rock and roll is based on economy.ourse, there's his blistering axe on the balls-out rock and roll of \\"Travelin' Band\\".

B000002P7R|3.0|It's no shock that the two great cuts here, the wild blues \\"Look Over Yonder\\" and the made-on-the-spot instrumental \\"Pali Gap\\" were initially released in 1971 with much more stellar company. Except for the annoying \\"Stars That Play With Laughing Sam's Dice\\" and the meandering \\"Tax Free\\", each of the remaining cuts is worth a listen. The jazziness of the title track reveal where his leanings may have led him given a few more years. The same but different \\"Watchtower\\" fascinates as does the other Dylan cover. And though there are disruptions of a smooth flow, the home demos are evidence enough that this guy breathed and felt music like few others.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I purchased this book in preparation for the movie when my daughter expressed interested in it. I was pleasantly surprised by the book! My daughter enjoyed it so much it took her no time at all to read it through. Then I undertook the task of reading it and found it to be a delight. It has a wonderful mixture of mythology set within the modern timeframe.    I'll be buying the other books in the series, and looking forward to any more movies they make based on them!
B000093BDX|4.0|The first half of this 30-track career summation is el primo Beach Boys. \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" and \\"In My Room\\" retain their shine and have never sounded crisper. The second half, starting with \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", is where the overall quality dips some. None of the post-1970 cuts should have representation here. But I'll withhold from too much griping because you can't miss with that sensational five-song finale with \\"Do It Again\\" leading the way. Still, 1974's deleted \\"Endless Summer\\" stands as the reigning compilation for these guys. It's more consistent and truer to its concept.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Seriously. I was under the impression that Discovery channel knew how upset people were that they replaced David Attenborough's narration with that of Sigourney Weaver for the American telecast of Planet Earth. So why would they repeat their mistake with Oprah Winfrey?     I guess I understand the theory. Maybe putting Oprah's voice on it will make the lonely lower class housewives watch it and learn a little bit about the environment. Plus I'm sure they're getting tons of free advertising on Oprah's show. But how is Oprah qualified to talk about conservation and nature? She flies around on a private jet and wastes her money on a brand new wardrobe while she makes her fans bid on her hand-me-downs to raise money for her charity. At least Sigourney Weaver has some connection to the environment and is an intelligent college-educated woman. Oprah is just good at manipulating people. That does not make her a good nature documentary narrator. In fact, I thought she was awful and made the televised Life almost unwatchable.     So buy the David Attenborough version. They come out on the same day and are the same price but his narration is just at a far higher level than that of Oprah Winfrey.

1416550550|3.0|The premise of the book promises a good mystery.  A 4 year old girl shows up on the docks of Australia in 1913.  She carries a small suitcase, speaks like she came from wealth, but has no name.    The book follows the little girl, the same woman in 1975, her granddaughter in 2005, and various of her relatives from about 1903 forward as her story is slowly unfolded.    I enjoyed the opening where I was pulled into the mystery and I enjoyed the ending when finally the mystery is explained.  Although I could foresee the giant surprise (and found it to be a little mundane), there were enough small twists at the ending to keep me engaged.    However there were three problems with this book that kept me from really loving it.  First - It is 548 pages long.  I'd say 150 pages of that (first 50 and last 100) were engaging.  The middle 400 were boring with little happening to advance the plot.  Instead what we got was a 10 page scene about nothing important that dropped one line or one clue to advance things at around page 9.  I ended up skimming much of the middle looking for these single clues and (sadly) got rather good at finding them quickly so I didn't have to read the boring stuff.    Second - the author likes to drop the subject of sentences.  \\"Made a picture in her mind the way Papa had taught her.\\"  As a stylistic choice this didn't work for me.  It was clunky and every time she did this, I had to stop, go back, and mentally add back in the subject.  (I almost tossed the book because of this.  It really annoyed me.)    Third - the book is written in a ton of point of views from a ton of different characters and yet they all seemed exactly the same.  We are told that characters had quirks, but on the page they were all REALLY bland.  The character development just wasn't there for me.    I'd actually skip this one.  There are better mysteries out there.
B0039UTDFG|4.0|I normally hate anything with Oprah and I love all those documentaries narrated by David Attenborough.  But I think O does a great job (unlike Sigourney Weaver).  I also like the Attenborough narrations.  I would love to have both with out spending twice the money. So, the real complaints in all these 'reviews' should by why the discs don't include both audio tracks.  Bluray discs have a huge amount of space and it seems to me that an extra track could be included.

0452287022|4.0|It is a fictionalized account of the period (mid 1660's) that the model for the painting of the same name was painted, by Dutch Painter Johannes Vermeer. I enjoyed the book; it is interesting and moves along at a good rate. Chevalier paints a picture of life in this time and what must be endured.<br />There are also 9 colour plates of some of Vermeer's other paintings painted in this time.
B000095IUM|3.0|Far too bland and passive for my taste.  I seriously doubt that LvB expected that his symphonies would be this uninspiring in the interest of \\"authenticity.\\"  Beethoven was a composer/ conductor of great energy and intensity (see Thayer); this set lacks both. Harnoncourt gets too much credit in the trades (see Gramaphone) for being a pioneer of period performances without demonstrating that his interpretations come close to inspiring or historically accurate.  The Karajan 1963 analogue set, Toscanini with the NBC SO, Walter with the Columbia SO and even Furtwangler's WWII recordings with the Berliners (without 1, 2 and 8) in my view set the benchmark for modern instrument recordings.  For a truly wonderful set of period instrument/style recordings see Gardiner and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique with the Monteverdi Choir on DG Archive.  The Collector's Edition is now available at a bargain price.

B000025XKM|5.0|Nick Drake's is one of the many sad stories from the world of music. He was signed by a record company when he was just 20, released three albums, went into seclusion, and then died from overdosing on antidepressants, a death which was officially ruled a suicide. His music was well received by those who actually heard it, but partially due to his refusal to perform live or really do anything publicly, it never really sold well until many years later when the title track from this, his final album appeared in a car commercial. I instantly recognized it once the vocals started up, although I can't say whether it's the commercial or just hearing it on the radio. In any case, it's the beginning of one of the best folk albums I've heard in my limited experience, and certainly still worth listening today.    Except for a bit of piano on \\"Pink Moon\\", the entire recording is just a half hour of Nick with his voice and a guitar. It's apparently easily his sparsest release, but I found myself nevertheless enjoying what he was able to do with such a limited range of sounds. He plucks and strums his way through eleven similar but distinct enough songs, many of which portray all too vividly the personal issues and depression that likely led to his early death. There's \\"Place To Be\\" in which he already seems morose over his long gone youth at the ripe old age of 24. And then there's \\"Which Will\\", where he seems to ask a woman who she'll love if not him. And who can forget \\"Parasite\\", a title that conjures an image of a despicable, loathsome pest and is in reference to Nick himself. And despite all this self negativity, there's a simple beauty to the music itself that somehow makes the whole thing even more depressing. It's not the most interesting album I've ever heard, but it's one of the most emotionally affecting, and definitely worth a visit for anyone interested in the genre.

B002ZG977Y|3.0|Never mind that Clash of the Titans play fast and loose with the mythological story of Perseus. Never mind that Medusa wasn't a Titan. Never mind that the Kraken is from Scandinavian mythology, and that casting Lawrence Olivier as Zeus in the 1981 version was sort of typecasting.<br /><br />The new Clash of the Titans is a darker, grittier more realistic Bronze age world than the 1981 version, but the story hasn`t changed all that much. The citizens of Argos have become disenchanted with the rule of the Gods. The Gods have caused too much chaos and ruin to their lives so they've decided to take their destinies into their own hands, and destroy the temples and statues of the Gods. In doing so, Perseus'(Sam Worthington) family is killed by a falling statue of Zeus. When Zeus (Liam Neeson) learns of the desecration urged on by Hades (Ralph Fiennes), he decides to destroy the city in four days or they can offer the sacrifice of the King of Argos' daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). In a visit to the throne room of Argos, Hades lets it slip that Perseus is a son of Zeus, a demi-god. Being told of his near divinity, Perseus and a group of soldiers go off on their quest to save the city.<br /><br />The special effects are great! The monsters look real and the characters realistically interact with them. In 3D the water roiling off the undulating tentacles of the Kraken must look really cool! The problem is they shortchanged the story in favor of the special effects. The story only follows the barest of outlines of the myth. Same with the 1981 version, although it's a little more faithful to the myth. The most glaring lapse is there really isn't any reason for Perseus to save Argos. In the myth his reason to save the city is for the love of Andromeda. In this version he's a stranger to Argos and doesn't fall in love with Andromeda. She's barely a consideration until she's needed to be sacrificed to the Kraken. The only reason he seems to take up the quest is because he's the nearest handy demi-god that can help out. Worthington's Perseus doesn't seem very heroic, there doesn't seem to be any emotional investment in Perseus in either the quest or the surrounding characters. Most of the time he has a stoically sullen, put upon attitude, and this keeps the audience at arms length from the character. He doesn`t seem to embrace the heroic at all. Yes, he kills the monsters, but the tasks he must accomplish like tricking the Stygian witches and figuring out how to survive the encounter with Medusa, he seems to accomplish almost by accident. It seems that Perseus isn't meant to be heroic. he repeatedly says he wants \\"to do this (the quest) as man, not a God,\\" and he keeps refusing the gifts of the Gods. The message in the myth is for mortals to find the divine, to find the god, the hero within themselves, Perseus' refusal of the gifts of the Gods, is the refusal to find the hero within himself.<br /><br />The 1981 version, although a bit campy in it's delivery tells the hero's story better. The 2010  version delivers better on the special effects. If such a thing were possible as to merge the strengths of both, you would have a better movie.<br /><br />DVD Bonus Features: The only bonus features offered with the DVD are deleted scenes.demi-god that can help out.

B000069HJN|5.0|\\"Brother, Where You Bound\\" was a reasonable question to ask in the mid-eighties.  With an American President who refused to mimic the capitulating posture of the previous administration, the Cold War between The United States and The Soviet Union had reached a fever pitch.  And while history has proven Reagan's tone to be the antidote to Soviet aggression, it is also important to remember that a very reluctant European populace was inextricably caught between this proverbial rock and a hard place.  Although songwriter Rick Davies' concerns clearly mirrored those of much of Europe, he _does_ represent the other side in this time in history in the fourth verse from the album's title track.  Many Supertramp fans regard \\"Brother, Where You Bound\\" as the single most epic piece the group ever produced and, considering the weight of the subject matter, they certainly have point!  Since this song is not available for download, I would recommend picking up the entire album rather than just cherry-picking here and there.  While Roger Hodgson is certainly missed, none other than David Gilmour steps up to the plate to deliver some fantastic guitar work throughout this sixteen-and-a-half minute odyssey!<br /><br />The very strong single [[ASIN:B000V636JA Cannonball]] affected me the same way that The Alan Parsons Project's [[ASIN:B000IOM1YQ Stereotomy]] did; defiant of trends and thoroughly engaging!  An exceptional poly-rhythmic song that never overstays its welcome despite being seven-and-a-half minutes long.  If, for any reason, you are reluctant to purchase the entire album, dip your toe in the water here!<br /><br />But those who jump all the way in will be richly rewarded with the beautifully atmospheric [[ASIN:B000V6A8FU No Inbetween]].  In some many ways, this is my favorite piece on the whole album and this remaster does a wonderful job of expressing the resonance of the song's opening ringing bells.  As a matter of fact, this remaster dodges the pitfall into which so many other remasters fall; there is no undue narrowing of the dynamic range!  And while I do wish the essential cannon of Supertramp, of which \\"Brother, Where You Bound\\" is one, was available on Sony's Super Audio CD, this redbook compact disc is audiophile quality.ers fall; there is no undue narrowing of the dynamic range!

B000J4OYTK|5.0|This is not a review on the album Tommy as far as the songs go because we all know how brilliant this album is from start to finish. But I must say that Classic Records did a masterful job at repressing this vinyl at 140 grams in weight. The packaging is fantastic and it sounds better than ever. I usually never hear any loud cracks and pops when purchasing the 140, 150, 180 and 200 gram vinyl. If the companies like Classic records keep on pressing them, I will keep on buying them. They are keeping vinyl alive and fresh by doing this and the response has been phenomenal. Even the packaging is pretty much a replica of the original pressing which makes you feel like you are buying an album just like you did in the 70's and 80's. Way to go Classic Records on this incredible Tommy pressing.

0307454541|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel, especially as it had two major plots going at the same time; the mystery was very well done.  But I thought that the violence, especially given the nature of the violence, was too graphic.  The author could have toned it down without sacrificing anything.
0312379293|4.0|This is a good story of getting one back after being found guilty for a crime the leading character didn't commit. References to The Count of Monte Cristo's theme is prevalent and for a reader it is a patient pace to the end with vivid characters and courtroom drama that engulf the story.  Archer uses his fluid writing skills and storytelling to good use, however there are bits that feel a little dragged. The closing chapters of the book pick up rapid pace and you can be sure the pages will turn to a great ending.
0446567337|4.0|I enjoyed reading Dear John. It's not just about John and Savannah's romance but also about John's relationship with his father and how over time it evolves into something much better than they had before. Sparks does a good job of showing that although mistakes can be made in a person's youth, it doesn't mean they're a lost cause. On a negative note, I wasn't real happy with the ending. John's a nice guy but the ends a little unbelievable no matter how nice he is.
B001FB55L2|3.0|First and foremost, if you're looking for a lot of action and possible explosions, then Brothers will probably bore you to sleep. However, if you're looking for a film that has a lot of drama and some suspense building up to an apex of action, then perhaps Brothers is for you.    Brothers is about the model son/father/husband/soldier being called off to war to fight for his country. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is a \\"favored son\\",loving husband, great father and a Captain in the US Armed Forces.    His brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is just returning home from prison from what appears to be a bank robbery. He is not to the son that he was supposed to turn out to be according to his father. This aspect plays out throughout the movie.    Natalie Portman (Grace) is Sam's loving wife. She plays a gorgeous and supportive wife and loving mother.    When Sam gets called off to war to go to Afghanistan, his life after that will never be the same again. You'll have to watch the movie yourself to determine why. While Sam is away fighting for our country, Tommy is good with Sam's kids and he also seems to fill an emotional void with Grace. Come to find out, Tommy has a secret crush on Grace. Grace and Tommy begin spending a lot of time together while Sam is away. And that time spent together seems to continue even after Sam comes home. Because of what Sam has endured in Afghanistan, he finds it extremely difficult to communicate with his wife and kids. Over time Sam seems to become suspicious of an affair between Grace and Tommy in spite of Tommy bringing another woman by the house. What I will say without giving away the movie is that Sam confronts both his wife and Tommy. The movie builds to an apex from there.    In my opinion, Brothers lacked an appropriate ending. Though the drama was intense, there were too many loose ends that weren't tied up to make the movie complete. Everyone involved in the action portion of this film did a stellar job. It's the writers that did theactors an injustice by putting on (what I think) an incomplete movie. I'd give this movie 3 and half stars. You'll like the movie, BUT you're going to be looking for more when the credits start to roll...
B001J53X9U|3.0|The movie is great: however, I'm not sure it's worth the extra cost for the batpod. You can probably find as many batman toys as you'd like separately for a better price.

B002TZS5GU|3.0|Carriers: 6 out of 10: What amazes me about Carriers is how it has the exact same plot as Zombieland. A story about two siblings traveling across a devastated and depopulated United States to visit a theme park in California that reminds them of childhood. The movies even share the same fetish for a nerdy character that has come up with all the rules to keep them alive.    While Zombieland was filmed in early 2009 and released later that year on 3000 plus screens; Carriers was filmed in 2006 and released on a hundred screens in 2009 to virtually no fanfare. Only actor's Chris Pine's recent starring role in the Star Trek movie caused it to be released theatrically at all.    The other main difference is while Zombieland on the surface may appear to be a horror-comedy along the lines of Shaun of the Dead it really is more of a straightforward comedy with gore and zombies. Carriers also certainly appears to be a horror film on the surface but it really isn't. This is large D drama that starts off serious and gets quite disheartening before the end credits role.    Carriers is a medical drama writ large mixed with a post-apocalyptic future. There are no zombies or even 28 Days Later pseudo zombies. This is not an exploitation film as there is no nudity nor violence; there is also very little action. There is simply a small handful of sick people, a small handful of not yet sick people and a copious amount of dead people. It is more a sequel to a bird flu movie than a Dawn of the Dead film.    Carriers biggest problem is it simply is hard to root for any of the characters. Chris Pine and Lou Taylor Pucci play the siblings heading to their childhood vacation spot (of which we see strange seventies era super 8 nostalgia footage though judging by the age of the characters their childhood was in 1995). Pucci is the rules nerd while Pine is a super jerk (or as TV Tropes wisely points out a Psycho Party Member).       Then you have the ladies. Emily VanCamp plays what wouldseem to Pucci's girlfriend but she is frigid, preppy, and possibly a lesbian. At the very least the \\"I wouldn't kiss you if you were the last man on earth\\" rule seems to apply here. Piper Perabo as Pine's girlfriend is borderline likable but she is whiny and a liar and I really am grading on a curve here.     Only Christopher Meloni as a father with an already sick daughter seems to pull on the heart strings; but he isn't a member of the core group and they separate ways halfway through.    The acting is good across the board with Meloni and VanCamp the standouts. The film also seems much grounded in its reality and logic is safely tucked into bed every night. I simply wish the movie was about a different group of survivors.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I'll be the first to admit my addiction to the show.  It is so bad I have actually been able to recruit additional addicts.  Great show.  The plot changes but not so drastically you get frustrated.  Actually very intriguing.  Keeps you wondering what is next....
B000068QZK|4.0|Ozzy finished the `80's strongly with yet another new lineup featuring another guitar prodigy in Zakk Wylde. This partnership has been almost as long and enduring as the one with Sharon and Wylde has become another metal icon whether in his long career with the Oz or in his own Black Label Society. `No Rest for the Wicked' which came in the fall of 1988 is probably the heaviest record in Ozzy Osbourne's career due in no part to Mr. Wylde's ultra aggressive guitar style.  The album is also a much more consistent and stronger LP the either of its two predecessors (the Jake E. Lee records, though I love Badlands!) \\"Miracle Man\\" is a great opener and a definitive shot at the hypocrisy of televangelists which had targeted Ozzy and his ilk for years.  \\"Crazy Babies\\" and \\"Breaking All the Rules\\" both received some strong airplane though nothing to rival his earlier output.  Bob Daisley came back to write most of the lyrics and they seem to be an improvement over much of his work on `Ultimate Sin'.  Ozzy even revisits the subject of alcoholism in \\"Demon Alcohol\\" which is a fine cut but doesn't hold a candle to \\"Suicide Solution\\". `No Rest' is an enjoyable piece of madman mayhem that showed an artist who though again working with new collaborators could be depended upon to deliver the goods.
B0032KNA4I|3.0|It was a good movie if you simply suspend your belief in reality.  As in all movies coming out of hollywood now-a-days, one must accept this movie with a grain of salt.  Lots of action and the characters were very involved.  There was not a lot of depth development for some and some \\"moments\\" when you wished there was no development.  All in all, worth watching, but, I wouldn't write home about it.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|I was looking forward to seeing this when it was released to the Theater. I didn't get to see it until I purchased the DVD. What a pile of crap this movie turned out to be.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|Into The Wild is a decent drama film, watchable enough without being too sappy, but sappy enough without being all-out goofy. The standout thing about it is the music. Sean Penn's old pal Eddie Vedder alone with a microphone and acoustic guitar would be the basis (at least sound wise), and that's perfect for a film like this. His warm baritone is like a storyteller lamenting the past but embracing the fun and sun. Very enthralling, touching and addicting. While it's great as long as it lasts, the whole thing is over in just 33 minutes, which is a little on the short side. Perhaps I'm picking too much about the quantity of minutes though, but as far as quality goes, this is one not to be missed.

B000X1BPYQ|4.0|I remember the night still, feeling so bizarre after just having seen the film [[ASIN:B001MEJY8W Martyrs]] for the first time, and following that with this fantastic album. It's something unique, spawned from the culture of Greece, and combining black and death metal touches with chants, pipes (I think, I might be mistaken on this) and choirs. Plenty of it epic and compelling, but working on a deeper level - the instruments are used exceptionally, there's a lot of attack and metal here, but the songs are broader than your average headbanger album. The standout track on this is without a doubt Nemecic - hearing the enthralling melody kick in on that, combined with the chanting vocals and thumping drums, gets to me every single time. That's the way it ought to sound! Highly recommended, especially if you're looking for something unique but still \\"metal\\" enough.
B0000029AL|5.0|10/10 - 5 stars<br /><br />The first album of Aerosmith, named as the band itself, shows us a group of musicians with clear tendencies towards Rock and Roll, Hard Rock and Blues. However, its truly sound, or the one which would remain for more than a decade, would start to become stronger since the next album, Get your Wings. From beginning to end, the proposal of the Aerosmith album is not only varied -from the very-well-elaborated power ballad 'Dream On', to the enjoyable and realistic rocker track 'Mama Kin', passing through the electrified blues of 'One Way Street', among others- but also cheeky, and that is because we can easily perceive, more than once, the double entendre included in some of its messages throughout the lyrics -a typical characteristic of the Rock genre, but wisely used by Aerosmith.<br /><br />It's important to mention that the band goes directly to the point in this first album, not only because of its sound, but also (again) its lyrics, which mainly talk about life experiences that ended up in disappointments and the subsequent attempt to go on, always including realistic or sarcastic elements, or a mixture of both. Furthermore, the rhythms of the songs tend to be catchy: once you've heard them, they stick in your mind and you feel like wanting to keep the tempo.<br /><br />The record opens with 'Make it', a song whose first paragraph tells us that people, in the end, will use their instincts to survive (or, simply, to go on living normally). The rest of the song talks about someone who has to pay their dues for having chosen the wrong path in life since the beginning, which can be due to the corrupt use of their instincts all the time.<br /><br />The following track is 'Somebody', a song with a marked and catchy riff, and lyrics to which lots of lustful people can feel identified with. Slightly perverted, the song tends to be sarcastic in a general sense and can make you smile if you are in a good mood, or even cheer you up if you are not but willing to relax a little.<br /><br />Then comes a song that would establish a very important point of influence on the Hard Rock scene (in fact, on the whole music scene): 'Dream On'. The message is clear, concise and direct: seize every instant of your life since it might end at any moment. You can learn from any experience, don't waste your time doing endless calculations. Now, the way the song has been elaborated makes us think of a band that has a lot of experience, even though their members were very young at the moment the record was released. Furthermore, their melodies, full of suspense, melancholy and feelings of freedom, create an atmosphere that adds intensity to the song.<br /><br />Suddenly, the intro of the best song in the album, in my opinion, begins: 'One Way Street'. Seven minutes under the same tempo, highly soaked in blues, which creates the sensation of wanting to snap your fingers at the same rhythm during the whole track. The lyrics are at the same time a complaint, a warning and a declaration. Her indecorous and irritating behaviour causes him to rethink his life and make important decisions.<br /><br />No matter what you do in your life -or with it-, regardless if good or bad -of course it's better if you do it the right way-, don't ever lose contact with your family. This seems to be the message that 'Mama Kin' leaves us, another milestone of the album. Having a riff clearly marked, this song would turn itself into another important point of influence on the nearby future (and it is still today). It also includes passages of saxophone.<br /><br />The next one is another song with blues influences, but with a happier general rhythm, a characteristic that is also reflected in the lyrics even though they talk about a serious theme. This person finds himself lost in its way, drowned in loneliness and in the distance, his soul is far away -it looks as if his current state were due to having been left by his girlfriend-, and asks for someoneto write him a letter! (Therefore, the title 'Write Me'.) -Apparently, that 'someone' is the woman he loves.<br /><br />'Movin' Out', one of the best tracks of the album, begins with a guitar melody in its purest and most fundamental rock and roll sense, which reflects all that the band was at that moment: rock from the bottom to the top. The lyrics present two scenes: on one side, it shows the stage that Aerosmith was living at the time -mostly, metaphorically-, or what their members were expecting due to their own effort. On the other hand, but in a related way, it says that, to see the light, you must take the right path from the beginning and be honest, never go astray.<br /><br />Finally, the last track on the record is 'Walkin' the Dog', a Rufus Thomas cover, whose music belongs to the Rhythm & Blues genre. The song includes passages of nursery rhymes. When played by Aerosmith, its musical style is comparable with that of 'Write Me', but its lyrics go in another direction. This time it seems to be shown a comparison between two women: first, a lady of high society with certain limitations when doing the daily chores is introduced; then, quite the opposite, there is a girl who belongs to a lower socioeconomic class (apparently), but completely different in terms of abilities to do the same tasks. Curiously, both girls are named the same.<br /><br />When the album begins, the intro itself (from 'Make it') makes you think that something big is about to happen. To this, the phrase 'You got to think of what it's gonna take to make your dreams' is added, which was used by Aerosmith to say, in a few words, that you are going to have to make a concerted effort if you want to see your dreams realized. Their members have gone through a lot of pernicious difficulties along their career, but they have known how to get over them.

B000ENWKN8|3.0|Rob Zombie has become known for his unique sound. After disbanding from the thrashy groove rock of White Zombie, it wasn't long before he was cemented as a kind of electronic hard rocker dude, providing a stream of unchallenging (but always catchy) songs with plenty of party atmosphere and ghoul nostalgia. It was fun while it lasted, but then came this - the first spark of something different. Some were unimpressed, but I welcomed the change. The first track doesn't tell you much is up, \\"American Witch\\" sounds just like old times. But right after that, there's \\"Foxy Foxy\\", oddly mellow and yet surprisingly addictive. Instead of banging your head you could actually stomp your feet or clap your hands in pace with this, and Rob's got a lighter singing tone, almost speaking or whispering the lyrics instead of using his typical \\"whine\\". You'll also notice that for once (thank goodness), not all the songs are about old black and white monsters, there's a more traditional, \\"dusty\\" kind of desert rock feel to this one. It feels more inspired by a cheap roadside motel than a Transylvanian castle, and I have to applaud Rob's efforts for that. \\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\" is probably one of my favourite tracks - again, kind of scaled down, but literally with a clapping rhythm that'll stick in your head. \\"Death Of It All\\" is also one of those songs that'll go by largely unnoticed, but it's probably the closest thing to sincerity the man's ever done (and likely to ever do). If it's anything holding it back though, the album ends on a weak note - The Devil's Rejects is the name of one of my all-time favourite films ever, but also one of the weakest and most uninspired songs. Overall it's a solid 3 out of 5 though - don't be quick to shy away just because he substituted electric guitars with acoustic ones. Listen to it a couple of times before you make a final judgment. Unfortunately his next one, [[ASIN:B002ZLPCUA Hellbilly Deluxe 2]], tried to sort of fuse the two sounds together and ended up falling flat.nded up falling flat.
0756405890|5.0|I'm not sure that there's anything I can add to these reviews that hasn't already been said.  I'm not, admittedly, normally a fan of this genre.  I skip over the fantasy and sci-fi sections at the bookstore....don't even browse there, as a matter of fact.  While I loved Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as a child, the genre never really appealed to me.<br /><br />A good friend gifted The Name of the Wind to me last year, saying that I really had to read it, and the book lingered on my shelves for over a year.  A few days ago, I picked it up and took it with me on the airplane for a five-hour flight.  Quite literally, I couldn't put this book down until I finished it.  I haven't been this enthralled with a novel in years.  First person narrative stories normally don't work well for me, but this story was told so masterfully that I wasn't just reading the narrative, it's as if I was right there with the characters.<br /><br />So I'm here to recommend this book to all non-fantasy/sci-fi readers.  Read this book, it is simply astounding and I promise you, you'll be waiting on tenterhooks for the next two in the trilogy along with the rest of us.
B0014Z4ON4|4.0|A lot of people have mixed feelings about Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom. Some don't like it because of Willie & Short Round, others like it because it has more action than Raiders of the Lost Ark. Personally, I do find it to be weaker than Raiders and Last Crusade, but it's also a notch above Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Out of all the primary Indy films, this is the darkest and bloodiest of them all. The atmosphere is less mystical and far more nightmarish. The gore is just as strong as in Raiders, though perhaps slightly stronger. The humor relies more on slapstick, which may not be acceptable for some people. And finally, Willie and Short Round are people you either love or hate. I, for one, don't like these two very much. Willie is your typical damsel in distress, while Short Round is your standard child sidekick you see in other Hollywood action films. They're not that terrible, but they are still annoying.<br /><br />So what exactly should be said about Temple? Well, it's not that great, but it's still fun. It has a tremendous amount of energy surrounding both the action scenes and the storytelling. You still care about Indy whenever he's in danger. The special effects are still impressive, even if a couple of shots of it look pretty dated. And even though I'm not a fan of John Williams, his music in the film is still spectacular. The plot is obviously contrived, but little matter. In the end, Temple of Doom is still a very good movie, just not as good as Raiders and Crusade. It's still better than Crystal Skull, though.<br /><br />Grade: B
B002ZG9788|3.0|Does anyone else feel that the \\"Release the Kraken\\" line has been used way too much in all the TV adds and trailers? Other than those three words, I was quite looking forward to Clash of the Titans. I have never seen the 1981 version, even though I tried renting the Blu-ray prior to seeing this remake, but it's not in stock anywhere. Those looking for high art are at the wrong movie, but if you want some B movie popcorn fun, this might do the trick. Parts of it reminded me of the mess that was 10,000 B.C., but it never quite gets that bad.<br /><br />The acting is slightly better than I had read about from critics. Sam Worthington is okay, though a bit too bland. He was much better in Terminator: Salvation and Avatar. I'm still not sure if this guy has star quality or not. Liam Neeson (Zeus) and Ralph Fiennes (Hades) both turn in performances worthy of a movie with better writing, but they manage to do the most with the average script. Same goes for Mads Mikkelsen (Draco). As far as the ladies go, Gemma Arterton (lo) and Alexa Devalos (Andromeda) are nice to look at for sure, but Arterton's character is more interesting, mainly because she is actually given things to do.<br /><br />Movies like this live and die by the CGI. About half of it works, but some is very mediocre. Nothing reaches the depths of The Scorpion King look in The Mummy Returns, but at least that has the excuse of coming out in 2001. Which leads me to the 3-D. If given the choice of 2-D or 3-D, I don't mind paying double the price for this popular format, but I'm glad I listened to the critics and other movie goers who have said that the rushed 3-D job here stinks. At least Alice in Wonderland had a lot of time put into it's upconvert. I heard they spent only two months or so on Clash of the Titans, leaving the film looking too dark and turning the action scenes into nothing more than headache starters. Take it from me, I saw it in 2-D, saved five bucks, and thought it looked good.<br /><br />I love Greek mythology, with all the cool creatures that go along with it, and I'm currently hacking and slashing my way through God of War III, so Clash of the Titans was fully entertaining in my eyes, but this movie needed more effort in the script and CGI department. Still, it's fun and worth seeing on the BIG screen. In fact, I'm not sure if they should have made this movie any less silly. Perhaps that's exactly what it's suppose to be.<br /><br />Perseus may be the son of Zeus here, but Kratos will always be my God slayer.all the cool creatures that go along with it, and I'm currently hacking and slashing my way through God of War III, so Clash of the Titans was fully entertaining in my eyes, but this movie needed more effort in the script and CGI department.

6305076995|4.0|I was a little dissappionted.   Since I had never been to a Yes Concert, I have no base to judge a performance, except the Yes Albums,  and having seen them for one or two song TV Concerts. Well rehearsed and very tight as a Band.   This is of the Full Band with Rick Wakeman.    the Band look's animated (Coked up) except for Jon Anderson.   The video is better than I expected, the audio sounds like a VHS tape transferred to digital, and not mixed quite right  the recording captures the Band at that moment in time.   (you can never tell what internal conflicts are going on with in the Band at that time)  All the Music and each Note is in there, But the Band is not Tight.  A Yes Lover should have this. There may be a better Video of Yes in Concert.  I am looking for it.  This is a piece of History. 1972 and Andersons performance Saved this DVD for me
B000X107GI|5.0|Good pricing, ok product.  Had to email the company and send pictures to figure out the 'date code' so I could be certain they weren't old batteries.  Ok in the end.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Great album - just downloaded the MP3 album and it's instant gratification. I'm not usually a huge country music fan, but I keep hearing \\"Need You Now\\" on the radio and XM. It's just a great song. Great driving tune, great kicking back and just listening tune. And it turns out the whole album is that way, too. Very easy to listen to. I don't buy a lot of albums anymore - mostly single songs - but this one is definitely worth listening to the whole album.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|The thing I love about the Die Hard films is their complete lack of pretentiousness. They are big, dumb, stupid action films, but they know perfectly well that they're big, dumb, stupid action films and don't pretend to be anything else. No heavy-handed moralising or social commentary, no token attempts to be \\"deep\\", no multi-layered political plot filled with challenging twists. McClane is the Good Guy, his opponents are Bad Guys, Good Guy fights Bad Guys, Good Guy wins. Sure, it's cliched and predictable, but so what? It's great fun. And in the post-9/11 world, where every Hollywood action/thriller is full of \\"Are we really the bad guys?\\" navel gazing, the black-and-white morality of 'Live Free Or Die Hard' is actualy quite refreshing.     The plot is perhaps the one token attempt to be modern, involving cyber-hackers shutting down essentail infrastructure systems across the East Coast, bringing the US to a stand-still. But from here, you know exactly how this works. While the FBI and other experts just stand around frowning and looking worried, McClane dispatches the army of baddies almost single handedly, all the while coming up with a smart wisecrack to nail every moment. It is an older and more world-weary McClane in this installment, which of course just allows more room for jokes about his age, hair, fitness, and lack of technological nous.     This movie is unashamedly stupid. Turn off everything even remotely resembling a brain cell before watching this, and please don't bother trying to understand how McClane can survive 100 metre falls, car pile-ups, massive explosions, and hundreds of bullets. And as for why the baddies fire everything from a machine-gun to a missile at McClane without causing a scratch, while McClane can let off two bullets from a pistol and hit them between the eyes.....you know better than to ask that, don't you?    By now, Bruce Willis can play McClane in his sleep, and there are some surprisingly strong supporting roles. Justin Tong nails it as the nervy hacker Farrell, and I also loved Mary Elizabeth Winstead as McClane's daughter Lucy (who shares the same no-nonsense attributes as her father). Cliff Curtis gives Bowman unexpected intelligence and depth as the capable-but-hamstrung FBI head Bowman, and I wish there'd been more of Maggie Q as the very cool Mai, since Timothy Olyphant wasn't that menacing as the main villain.     You know exacly what you're going to get from a Die Hard movie, and the fourth installment delivers everything you want in spades. Brainless popcorn stupidity was never so much fun.

B0033QC0WE|5.0|I've been a starry-eyed admirer of the more polished, better-characterised HIP versions of Beethoven symphonies for many years. I know that many listeners will continue to vilify these versions till the end of time, but I will still be a keen supporter of this paradigm shift approach. I have embraced the paradigm shift of Beethoven performers as a listener, but yet I know these recordings will always be contentious territory.  I know that historically informed anything means hurry-sick performances and hurry-up tempo choices dictated by the rush-hour culture of today's world. I know also that there is mounting concrete evidence to suggest that the first musicians who performed Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and other composers adopted slower speeds out of necessity because of ragged ensemble standards and poor internal instrumental mechanics. As such, performers who adopt such stratospheric speeds might be part of a plot to drive the world to burnout and ruin. If our forbears were alive today, I'm half expecting them to scold today's musicians for their trivial, ignoble and vacant renditions that are lacking in musical substance.  However, I wearied of the stodgy, gloopy and slushy performances of Beethoven symphonies done by many conductors of the past. So I was grateful for conductors who attempted to adhere to Beethoven's stipulated speeds. His prescribed speeds work if you consider that he wants us to feel his music in larger beat units.  Of the first few historically-sensitive versions (Goodman/Huggett, Norrington/LCP, Hogwood and Brüggen being the others) I find that Gardiner is perhaps the most robust. The performances are more full-bodied than the others that had been released up to that point. Though the ORR was a young orchestra at the time they recorded this cycle (compared to Hogwood's AAM or Brüggen's Orchestra of the 18th Century), their punches and salvos are still strong in their clean, forthright renditions of the symphonies. I know that the European period-instrument recordings are more nuanced and focused on the beauty and blend of the sound, but Gardiner and the ORR are bracing and incisive where needed, and strong on characterisation too. They tend to better project the music out from the recording space.  Gardiner's Beethoven cycle does a marvellous job at capturing the Sturm und Drang aspect of the symphonies. Though some people are in principle against the fast speeds of the historically sensitive presentations, Gardiner makes them work and work convincingly. The light-footed symphonies come off well and Gardiner wisely holds back so that they don't sound too much like the heavier middle-period symphonies. It is to his credit that sometimes his speeds are sometimes slower than the metronome speed, as in the slow movements of the Second and Fourth. These slow movements spin themselves out nicely and at a flowing, just speed. It might be helpful to note that other conductors have outpaced Gardiner in the slow movement of the Fourth. The dotted rhythm could be a little bit more winsome (as it is in the Mackerras and Antonini recordings) but the main melody and discourse spins itself out nicely.  Any Beethoven cycle stands or falls on the quality of the great middle-period symphonies, and here Gardiner and his team succeed magnificently despite the many memorable readings we have had of these works in the past. The Eroica and the Firth are highlights in the cycle, and show Gardiner and his orchestra in their element. There is torque in the outer movements and a steady, nicely sculpted Funeral March. It might also help to remember that the Fifth is at heart a violent, brutal and headbanging symphony (in its minor-key sections), and so I am grateful that Gardiner acknowledges this in his performance. Gardiner also turns in some energetic and rhythmic performances of the Seventh and Eighth symphonies, and a nicely sculpted rendition of the Pastoral. I know that this particular symphony needs a &#34;long now&#34; conception, and as such the slower versions of Böhm and Walter fit better into such a conception. However, the Gardiner Pastoral, on the same CD as the Fifth, still sounds as fresh as spring. It doesn't sound rushed and I love the fact that it still feels &#34;con spirito&#34; even at these speeds. The climaxes build up naturally without being pushed, pressed or rushed. Also, Gardiner takes comparatively more time than his other historically-sensitive buddies. Norrington, Hogwood (and, for that matter, Karajan) undercut him in the first movement .The Brook flows peacefully and I don't feel any hint of Gardiner forcing the waters forward. He comes into his own when the storm breaks in the fourth movement, and holds back for a steady paced Shepherd's Thanksgiving.  As the Ninth is the longest symphony it will have a paragraph all to itself. The Ninth symphony may be a bit of a surprise to those who have known and loved the way that Wagner and his followers interpreted the work. They may think it's perverse, but it's a musical performance that works and approximates what we know so far of Beethoven's intentions for the work. There is a real Sturm und Drang quality to the first movement, pushing itself forward unlike in other performances where it plods along. There is more violence and brutality in this conception and the dotted rhythms are well-articulated while the music generates its own momentum. To those who complain that Gardiner is outpacing all other recorded performances in each and every movement, It is to his credit that he adopts a fast, but just, speed for the Trio in the Scherzo. I know that people will hate the way the historically sensitive Ninths have done the slow movement. To the detractors of this approach, it would be helpful to remember the family resemblance to the slow movement of the Pathetique and also the metrical superstructure of the movement. Here in a common-time movement the minims are the slow notes and so they need to set the pulse, notthe crotchets or quavers (as per the older conceptions of the Ninth in the past). Moreover the music can feel slow if the common-time bar is beaten in two, not four. I know that people will brand these Ninths as rush-hour Ninths but the music works at Beethoven's marked speed and allows the 12/8 variation to be really flighty. As a concession to those who are non-fans of the historically sensitive style, I notice that Gardiner's tempo is slightly slower than the metronome mark. Also, Norrington, Hogwood and Zinman streak past Gardiner in this movement. The Finale snaps and crackles with energy and has a superb team of soloists singing together with the superb Monteverdi Choir.  I'm very glad that DG has re-released this set as a budget-priced box. As such the budget-conscious collector now more choice when looking for superb performances of these works. The only downside to this release is that it would have been nice to combine the Gardiner Beethoven symphonies set and also the Gardiner/Levin cycle of piano concertos in one slam-dunk clam package for a marvellous bargain. But as it is it's great to have this cycle available and to seize the bargain of this re-release.  Though Gardiner and the ORR have since released re-takes of some of the symphonies (four at this edit of January 2016), these earlier recordings still hold up well. I feel there is a bit more &#34;fire in the belly&#34; and the characterisation is still sharp.  My readers will know that I love this Beethoven cycle tremendously. I know that the performance of these symphonies is a matter with no definite answers. But then, it is the mark of all composers if their music stood up to all manner of interpretation through time. Karajan, Weingartner and the other conductors of past generations have chipped in with their perspectives, just as today's conductors have done. Though people may vilify historically-informed recordings till the end of time, this set will still be a stimulating, provocative and durable Beethoven cycle and holds up well two decades after Gardiner and his ORR first recorded it.

B001OQCV2E|3.0|OK, so the entire humanity will die but we are supposed to care about 12 people? What's more, there is nothing special or even likable about the 12. So we are supposed to care if the little girl like her hats, that the main character sold only 500 books and hates his rival, that his son likes the stepfather better, that the mistress had a boob job, and a geophysicist liked the family he met at YellowStone? WHO CARES? The world is going to end and none of it matters. I wonder if anyone in the writing team ever thought of that.<br /><br />I certain'y didn't care about any of the characters. They were ALL boring, trite, and I cringed every time the film focused on the meaningless details of their lives that obviously added no value to the movie or character development. I mean the movie could have chosen ANYONE to focus its story but they just happens to be the most boring dysfunctional family you would ever want to know.<br /><br />The special effects, however, were spectacular.<br /><br />The movie was 20 minutes too long. I just didn't care about this movie after 2 hours. I just wanted to see the end and how the humanity would survive.<br /><br />I also give credos to the imagination of the film makers.<br /><br />Watch this movie if you have nothing better to watch. Just make sure you have your fast-forward button half pressed so you can move forward to the action sequences.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|The social message is not subtle but rather in your face.  This is one of those sleeper movies that has not gotten the positive exposure that it deserves.  It is more of a thinking man's sci-fi flick and it definitely leaves you thinking at the end.  No co-incidence that it takes place in South Africa.  It's gory but not gratuitous. The portrayal of the  chief protagonist reveals a complex persona not commonly seen in Hollywood's cookie cutter sci-fis of late.  Not perfect but I definitely recommend it as a must see.
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|This is an amazing cd that any fan of Porcupine Tree should love.  This release seems to me me what you would get if you combined Stupid Dream with The Sky Moves Sideways (as far as style goes).  Check out the Harmony Korine video on the PT website and you will see what I mean. Not a bad song on the disc, highly recommended.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|I was seeing the movie for the first time.  The BluRay transfer is excellent and  my subwoofer walked across the hardwood floor.  It's a great movie to play loud.  I'm a tech freak so I could really appreciate the special effects. I can't get enough of seeing LA and NYC getting destroyed.   However,  even for me that couldn't really offset the lack of plot.  The main characters were simply running away from impending doom (always just one step ahead).  The plot was too much like Day After Tomorrow, War of the Worlds, or Cloverfield, i.e., thin.  If you like apocalyptic destruction than this is for you.  If you want a fresh plot line with interesting character development, than look elsewhere.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the greatest laid back fun movies I've watched recently. It has great characters and dialog, plus the stop-motion and cinematography are breathtaking (make sure you see it on blu-Ray). The only small downside might be the plot, which is a bit generic, but it follows the story from the book. As to how much a child will enjoy this, I do not know, it has some heavy adult themes in it. The comedy is very offbeat, as always in Wes Anderson's films. I don't normally do reviews on here, but I was so amazed by this movie, that I just had to write something and hope it brings more attention to it. I didn't think it was the best movie of 2009, either. It was just a very, very fun, charming watch.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|\\"Surrogates\\" was a memorable four star sci-fi film which explored (on the big screen for the first time) the extreme limits of \\"virtual reality\\". The so called surrogates of the movie were clearly unconscious robots having no will of their own.  The concept of the general public using robotic bodies (remotely from their home while interacting with the world through a special simulation couch)is interesting, but an enormous waste of energy for a society trying desperately to \\"go green\\" (ugh) and to individuals, except perhaps for someone terribly maimed by an accident or otherwise bound to a wheel chair.  The idea is just nuts, but very interesting to think about. Think about robots driving cars, using mass transit systems, and other crowded and energy consuming resources. It obviously makes no sense, except as an allegory for the World Wide Web.<br /><br />Also interesting was that the \\"operators\\" of surrogates no longer took time to dress for work or waste their time on grooming because they must now keep the android properly attired and groomed for business.  The operators of surrogates were shown not to use make up, shave or dress and this is a reasonable projection of what would happen to individuals who work from home and interact with the world, their business associates and friends using the World Wide Web.<br /><br />I am a long time sci-fi fan and prefer robot stories which explore artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic \\"consciousness\\" in the sense of the Spielberg film by that name(and Arthur C. Clarke's HAL and SAL from 2001 and 2010). Still, \\"Surrogates\\" was a very interesting and well done film.  Also, some other examples of films more to my liking included: Blade Runner, I Robot, Bicentennial Man, Colossus the Forbin Project, and so on.  Needless to say, Bruce Willis was worth the price of admission alone.
031606792X|5.0|I just can't put into words how much I love this book.  It was wonderful and brought a sense of closure that I was hoping I would have after being so surprisingly attached to the characters and their lives throughout the Twilight Saga.  The book was well written and full of life.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|So you have a movie script that ultimately calls for two primary actors, and two others just for garnish here and there. Think you can swing it? Worked for the White Stripes, why shouldn't it work for movies? It absolutely works for Moon. Sam Rockwell's progression into paranoia, mental breakdown, conspiracy, physical breakdown proves that in this day in age of movies that cost more than the GDP of 50% of the nations on Earth, that you can still make an absolutely rock solid low budget flick.     I would not say it is for everybody. you must be able to deal with a quiet, emotional and psychologically driven story with relaxed pacing and little REAL action to be able to grasp this movie, as it is in no way shape or form an action or horror film. It is however a very rewarding experience in absolutely minimalist story telling, as in giving one character immense depth with almost nothing to play off of. It is a fantastic example of script writing, and character development.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I really like \\"true\\" movies.  This is a great movie about a football player - well, pre-football player. A must have movie if you watch football.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I am a 19 year old who saw this movie for the first time roughly 6 years ago. It was love at first sight, back then i was a mischievious little teen who had no respect for tragedies. Upon watching this movie it opened my eyes so wide and respect filled my heart for the Holocaust.    The movie was so well executed, so exquisite, it made my heart stopped. The mix of humor and tragedy made this movie set apart from all the other movies made from/for/tributing the Holocaust. One thing for sure it's that humor was still seen in the middle of a tagedy like this, it is a way to escape reality and some people never lost hope, or simply saw everything on the bright side.    I recommend this movie to those who are open and know how to judge a good movie, I am no expert at this of \\"critique\\" but I do know when a movie is worth watching it, owning it, and sharing it to others.  La vita è bella (THe Life is Beautiful) is that film.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|Ive watched the BBC Attenborough version and the first few episodes of the Discovery Oprah versions and as stated previously, the Attenborough narration is vastly superior. You can feel his passion for the subjects and years of experience expressed in every line. Discovery Channel must be commended for broadcasting the series to a broader audience but the alterations take away from experience. I highly recommend getting this BBC version. With the breathtaking camera work, narration, and score, this is a perfect companion to the Planet Earth series and should be part of any Blu-Ray collection.
1435248244|4.0|This was one of my first books for young adults based on a dystopian society and began my exploration of this explanding genre.  As an adult reading this book well after the series was popular, I wasut to  fascinated that teenagers took such a strong interest in such a dark topic that makes the future look so dim.  After reading more teen focussed dystopian books and discussing with librarians and teenagers, I have learned that the current generation of teenagers were raised in a world that witnessed 9 - 11, a long foreign war, Columbine, worry over the greenhouse effect, environmental disasters (hurricanes, tsuanamis, earthquakes) and reading these books helps focus their concerns on the future.  They don't expect the world to stay a safe place and believe that they will be the generation that has to come to terms with the problems in society and fix them to save the world.  That theme is very apparent in the Uglies and its sequels.  Conformity and beauty and the most valued traits in this futuristic town.  Once adolescents become 16, they undergo an operation that makes them beautiful, separate from the \\"Uglies\\" who are have not undergone the operation.  Once the operation is complete, the individuals have no cares or concerns beyond the next party and the current fad.  However, a group of teens end up discovering that it is more than appearances that get changed in the operation and work to undercover the reality of their society, creating friendships they never expected, taking risks that bring them even closer together.

There really isn't one track to I fell in love with and I'm one of her biggest fans. I find it crazy when I see other Sade fans giving it Five Stars  because you love . We are talking about the music here not the love for her as a fan which will never die. I love Sade but truth is truth and I waited along time for this to come out and I'm lost without feelings. Sade mastered the smooth middle grove \\" you know not a dance and not a slow song just perfect music to listen and enjoy love with that someone special \\"  This album doesn't take you there.  Truth
6304708521|3.0|I waited many years to find a copy of this film. Looking back it may not have really been worth the wait and expense. The film, made for British televisionand shown in black and white on Boxing Day 1967 was a critical failure. Today its a colorful journey into a past thet no longer exists.    The film features the bad on a \\"magical mystery tour\\" a bus ride with no particular destination where strange things happen. There is no more plot than that really and the film is simply an excuse for presenting some really great songs in the days before MTV.    The film features videoes for The Fool on the Hill, Flying, I Am the Walrus, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, Magical Mystery Tour and the impossible to find Death Cab For Cutie. Intermixed are scenes of wizards, a strip show and the stranges tent you've ever witnessed.    This one is for die hard fans only but it is an enjoyable way to spend an hour. The standard definition DVD features the film and zero extras.
B002ZG99D6|5.0|The Last Song is a great movie.  It is a coming of age movie but not just a chick flick.  All family members will enjoy this movie.  Miley Cyrus plays a somewhat troubled teen and blames her troubles on her parents divorce.  Her attitude quickly takes a turn when she falls in love and even more of a turn when she finds out that her father is dying with lung cancer.  Take a box of tissues to the theatre.  Miley plays this dramatic role very well.    In this movie you will be introduced to turtle eggs and you will see them crawl back to the ocean when they hatch.  I think this is interesting for children of all ages to watch.    Go watch this movie and go as a family.  We don't get many of these type movies so make it a family day and go.  You won't be sorry.    Although some young children are upset that the series Hannah Montana has ended, I have to say I am glad.  Miley Cyrus has so much more to offer to the entertainment business than her role as Hannah Montana. I think we will see her in many, many, more movies.
B000TJ6CPY|5.0|This is a rediculously low price for what is a classic album.  Clark Terry literally kills it on every track.  \\"Brotherhood of Man\\" is a great opener and sets the tone for this whole session.  He pushes Oscar and the rest of the trio to the top of their game.  This is not an uninspired mashup thrown together to sell copies, but a truly inspired date.  Everyone seems to be having a great time and is on top of their game.  When you hear Clark killing it on Brotherhood, Blues for Smedley, pretty much every track there is no way you can keep a straight face.  This whole record swings so bad it's unbelievable!
1584282584|5.0|after following Neil Van Niekerk on his blog and via a forum, I decided I better buy his book. I wanted to have all the Blog Info right in my hand, with examples, on the job. It is really nice to have an instructional book full with beautiful photography taken in situations I always encounter.  I am a wedding and portrait photographer and I mostly shoot available light, and when necessary, on camera flash. Well, sometimes, no, often, available light sucks. But so did my techniques on using my on camera flash. Normally I would bounce my flash, but never really got the natural look I was after.  Neil explains in detail, and with examples, how to get the best possible results with flash. He also introduces very inexpensive home made snoots to help shield and direct the light, so the photographer has total control where the light will fall.   All of this can be done, without lugging around heavy lightstands and softboxes, and lots of cables.   I can't wait to be able to use his techniques during my next portrait session and weddings.  Thank you Neil for putting it all into one, easy to understand book.   \\"on camera flash\\" is not only a resource for the professional photographer, it is also easy to understand for flash virgins. Your subjects will never again look like \\"deer in the headlights\\".  If you are thinking of buying any of the expensive plastic diffusers,stop right now.  I think this book would be a much better investment, and take your fear out of using on camera flash.
B002U33GUQ|5.0|Brad Mehldau has been hailed as one of the greatest jazz pianists since he came on the scene in the 90's and for good reason.  His largest audience came with the 2002 release \\"Largo\\", a  genre bending album, that got him the most attention and introduced a new audience (although polarizing some fans...likely the same kind of people who whined when Dylan plugged in) to Mehldau's work.  The experimentation on the record was exciting and fresh, but he was soon back to his more traditional style with the self-assured straight-ahead (yet very rewarding) album \\"Anything Goes\\"(2004).    Now after numerous trio recordings, solo outings and collaborations, Brad Mehldau and Jon Brion bring us \\"Highway Rider\\", the highly anticipated sequel to Largo.  Highway Rider is an album that really needs to be appreciated without any distractions, and preferably on nice equipment.  This album was very uniquely recorded and sonically sounds different than almost anything I've ever heard.  The nuances on this record are extremely important.  When I sat down and listened to the record for the first time I was shocked when the orchestra suddenly crept into the trio soundscape.  It is truly overwhelming.  This is not \\"Charlie Parker with Strings\\" or any overtly-commercial type orchestration by any means.  Think more along the lines of Phillip Glass.  This is serious and intense material.  These compositions are relentless in their dissonance, yet there are many beautiful moments that arrive out of this chaos.  All of Mehldau's compositions on this album work together as a body of work, and all of the musicians and the orchestra are all of one voice in a way that no other orchestra/jazz album has ever done successfully.  This work is truly a journey.  You will hear singing, children's voices, adult voices ,sounds of laughter, sounds of instruments of all kinds; sounds of pain and joy run throughout this entire work.   With so many people in the studio the danger is that things can sound fragmented, but that rarely happens on this project. When considering the cover art; thematically this album deals with the struggle of living the American dream, isolationism, the shattered illusions of a post tech-boom society, and the confusion and loss over America's unique identity in a overly-corporate society.  But it's also a very personal story as well (see Mehldau's notes for the album on his website).  It's comparable to works like Springsteen's Born to Run, The Great Gatsby, or On the Road.    Initially I wasn't sure what to expect out of this 2-CD set, but I figured that it wouldn't be able to match the originality of \\"Largo\\".  This album is of a completely different caliber.  This work is ambitious, groundbreaking, and visionary.  With all due respect to all of the other great pianists working in jazz today, I don't know how anyone can respond to this.  Mehldau has set the bar so high that he will be hard to touch.  I suppose some will sweep this album under the rug as an \\"interesting experiment\\" and write off the album's conceptual nature, but show me an album that will be more influential than this one 10, even 20 years down the line.  No other pianist or artist out there continues to reinvent the genre like Mehldau.  Nobody has ever made a record like this.  This album only solidifies his place in jazz as a genius and his newfound muse as a composer.      Highway Rider has changed the game.  Those few people who have been negative towards the album desparately want the attention for knocking down jazz's modern genius, but even they must know deep down inside that this work is profound.  Not only the greatest jazz album since Wayne Shorter's \\"Footprints Live\\" in my opinion, but also what will become one of the most important recordings of the 21st century.  I did not expect anybody to make an iconic jazz recording in this day and age and was literally in shock for hours after I finished listening to it.  Although Mehldau, like every musician, owes a lot tohis predecessors (Fred Hirsch, Evans, Monk, and countless others),  it's fair to say he has accomplished enough on his own to place him as one of the greatest pianists and jazz musicians of all time.
B001DRF84W|4.0|I'm not the biggest fan of Ang Lee(I like two other movies by him) but this gem has been denied for far too long. I think people expected this movie to be a brainless blockbuster and were upset when it didnt turn out the way they expected it to be. Hulk is pretty good with a few flaws(which I will mention later). Its definitely better than its given credit for.    The movie details Bruce Banner(Eric Bana)'s coming to be the Hulk. It deals with the Hulk's origin from Bruce's childhood to his teenage years. It also deals with his estranged father(Nick Nolte) coming back into his life. It deals with his relationship with Betty Ross(Jennifer Connelly)and her father Thaddeus(Sam Elliott)hatred for Bruce.    The acting is good all around. Eric Bana gives a heartfelt performance as Bruce Banner. Jennifer Connelly is a sweetheart as Betty Ross and Sam Elliott is perfect as Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross. Nick Nolte is also great as Bruce's eccentric father. Josh Lucas is the quintessential jerk as Talbot.    As much as I like this movie I cant give it five stars because...    Flaws: 1. The numerous attempts to get us to feel sympathy for Bruce being the Hulk. I applaud the effort but it just doesnt work for me. Bruce never hurts a loved one as the Hulk. We can only feel sympathy for him if he hurts everybody he loves as Hulk. But most of the people he hurts had it coming so to get us to sympathize with him is kind of difficult.    2. The split screens. Split screens are useful when there is action. This movie tends to overdue them a lot. When there is action split screens are useful but when nothing is happening on screen you waste the effect of split screens.    3. Length. I have no problem with this movie being long but there are some scenes in the movie that are superfluous to the storyline and should have been cut.    Other than that this movie is pretty good. I'll admit that at first viewing I thought it was decent but second viewing I liked it a lot more.  Its definitely better than the instantly forgettable 2008 sequel. And before I leave I must settle this argument. While the 2008 sequel is not bad its not memorable. How can you forget Hulk battling the gamma mutated dogs in this movie? How can you forget the helicopter chase scene? How can you forget Hulk handing Talbot his rear end on a platter? How can you forget the insight about Science and the harmful experiments ran on humans and animals? In Hulk 2008, the only thing you remember is a solid performance by Edward Norton and thats it. Instantly forgettable and was brought to you by the same director that gave you the easily forgotten Transporter 2. In conclusion Hulk is an underrated and unappreciated gem from a director that deserved more credit than he got for this movie. 2 thumbs up and thanks a million to everybody that defends this movie.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|While some give Saints II a bad rap, I've gotta say, having watched both the first and second, I find that II definitely lives up to the original. Okay, parts of it were repeats of the first and the Mexican guy's personallity might be a bit too \\"colorful\\", as he so aptly puts it, but I'd have to say that, all things considered, it didn't fail like so many other sequels (Rambo II & III, The Transporter III, etc). Yeah, it could have been better, but it also could have been a lot worse. So, while die hard fans of the first may be disapointed, for the casual viewer (like myself) it's a five star flick.
B000NA1XSA|5.0|This book gives a great behind-the-scenes view of recording the Beatles.  I love it.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I've had this for about a month now and use it often.  My previous portable was a Sharp mini disc w/some condensor mics built into an otter box, but this stopped working.  The H4n is much easier to use because of the mic stand mount, SD card (upgraded to 16 gig) and USB connection. So far, I've used this to record live preformances (my own groups), jam sessions, etc. for reference and evalutation.  The sound quality is good with the built in mics- the 90/120 degree variable pattern is a useful feature as well.  The display is well designed and bright enough to read in various lighting situations and the menus are easy to navigate and can be mastered in a fairly short time.    I didn't buy this with the illusion of making pro recordings but was hoping that it would work well enough record tracks/loops which I could piece together on my PC.  This would seem possible with the additional inputs for mics and instruments, and is another reason that I chose this unit over others, as well as being able to record in 4 track mode.  The ability of using the H4 as an audio interface is also a great feature, but I couldn't get this to work well (tried this for about 1/2 hour without success).  My M-audio 410 which works well so I gave up, but I would be dissapointed/frustrated if I needed to use this capability.  I also spent a few minutes recording in the multi-track mode.  The effects are okay but again, I haven't worked with these enough to form an opinion.  The 'stamina' mode is great too (I think I recorded for about 5 hrs straight on battery power) however it does disable some features.      The cons is that it is a little large and the mics are not protected if it were to be dropped, which I've done twice now but was lucky enough to have it land 'softly.'  It wouldn't seem too difficult to design and protective cage.

B0000AUHPB|5.0|This movie is utterly of its time. Rather than rattle us, scare us, thrill us, it charms us, just about effortlessly, through a perfect combination of cast, script, music, and direction. Caine is terrific as heist head man Charlie Kroeger, but the greatest pleasure comes from Coward, playing a behind-bars king of Anglo-Saxon crime with a fixation on The Queen. In a small part, Benny Hill is a delight. The chase scenes are filmed not from the cars' bumpers, but from a graceful distance, and Jones's music is a deliciously light accompaniment to the playful Mini Cooper sequences that benefit as much from Turin's scenery as from unexpected twists and turns--across a weir, swinging through a sewer pipe.     From beginning to end this is a gem, breezy, light, devoid of any real grit or seriousness.

1594488843|5.0|Why are lawyers so miserable?  Surveys like this one from the American Bar Association [...] consistently show that, despite having relatively prestigious and lucrative careers, lawyers are less happy with their jobs than many other professionals.  Why is that?  Is it the long hours?  The burden of student loans carried over from law school?  The endless lawyer jokes?<br /><br /> In Drive, Daniel Pink argues that they're unhappy because they lack the right motivation.  A good salary is a start, but human being require other stimuli in order to thrive in the long run.  Lawyers, especially junior associates at big firms, have relatively little control over their work and face strict demands on how much time they need to bill every day, week, month and year.  Young lawyers find themselves dissatisfied with their careers because they find they don't get to choose work that they find interesting or rewarding.  Assignments are handed to them by partners and they have to make do with whatever they can get. So instead of facing-off in court against Perry Mason, Ally McBeal or Patty Hewes (pick your generation), they wind up working on an assembly line cranking out billable hours.<br /><br /> What lawyers are missing is a sense of autonomy-- one of the three factors that Pink argues are crucial for motivating the 21st Century workforce.  I'm not going to summarize the whole book since Pink does such a good job himself.  Here's the \\"Cocktail Party\\" summary from the toolkit he provides as an appendix:<br /><br />When it comes to motivation, there's a gap between what science knows and what business does.  Our current business operating system-- which is built around external, carrot-and-stick motivators-- doesn't work and often does harm.  We need an upgrade.  And the science shows the way.  This new approach has three essential elements: (1) Autonomy-- the desire to direct our own lives; (2) Mastery-- the urge to get better and better at something that matters; and (3) Purpose-- the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.<br /><br /> I admire how Pink keeps his thesis simple enough that it's easy to understand and recall (having 3 main points is key) while backing up his ideas with anecdotes from business and scientific studies.  And the \\"cocktail party\\" summary is something many writers should adopt.  If nothing else, it might help some of them focus on what it is that they really have to say.<br /><br /> Don't let Pink's use of science turn you off-- it's covered quickly and written about in a clear manner that makes it palatable for all kinds of readers. I'd recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the idea of what motivates people.  You don't have to be a \\"business person\\" to find something valuable here.  If you feel stifled in your own job, Drive might help you find a way to make it more rewarding-- or help you make the decision that it's time to do something else.  It also has suggestions on how to motivate your kids to do their chores, how to lose weight in ways that are more likely to work in the long run, and how to reform our educational system so that kids can motivate themselves.  But I'd mostly just recommend Drive for its insights into what makes us happy-- and what doesn't.what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I don't think anyone reads Dan Brown for his literary genius...He's an average writer who has had some great plot ideas in the past.  Unfortunately, it appears that Brown is trying too hard in Symbol to retain his past praise.  It's formulaic and predictable given his past works.  That being said, it is an enticing concept (though a little played out if you've seen any National Treasures).  I believe Da Vinci Code fans will love it (fighting the image of Tom Hanks aside) because The Lost Symbol delivers just what one should expect from Brown's other works...mediocre writing and sensationalistic plots that amount to a page turner...sort of like ordering an appetizer for a meal.
030745455X|4.0|Book two in Larsson's Millennium trilogy pays off on a lot of the Salander material from The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. If that book can be looked at as describing her 'what' then Played with Fire deals more with the 'why'. How did she end up a guardian of the state? Who was her family? How does she get out from under her past?<br /><br />I found it a quicker read than Thje Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and perhaps a bit more of a classic thriller, with all that's good and bad about that. There were elements of the plot that annoyed me in this book-- the breast augmentation, the famous boxer angle (too much!)-- but I hardly noticed them until after I had finished. The book moves very quickly.<br /><br />Still a cut above most thrillers. I've already bought The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.
1400052173|5.0|One of the things that I  remember about my childhood in the 1950s and 60s was how little could be done for family members who became ill.  The word \\"cancer: was barely spoken.  Heart disease was mentioned, but only as a reason that someone was permanently disabled.  Doctors, who could do so much less than than can today, were venerated far more than they are today.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks was a young African American woman who listened to her doctors and didn't question.  In that she was not unusual. As I read about her I could not let go of a feeling of dread.  How would I feel knowing that my mother's cells were famous in the research community and that portions of her name were used without the slightest concern that this nicknamed substance had once been a person, that her medical records had been freely given out to reporters, that my brothers and me had been given blood to researchers from Johns Hopkins, under extremely questionable circumstances?  How would I feel hearing that her cells had been donated, when in fact, there was no donation?  When I read the callous comments of the director of medical genetics who took the blood without adequately explaining its purpose, brushed off the entire situation and casually included Harriet's name and her children  in a report that made her reputation, I nearly fainted.  We may think that researchers  are more aware of these things today, but we shouldn't take that for granted. Much of what is reported in this book is still perfectly legal. It was nice to see that this woman's behavior  is now against the law.<br /><br />This amazing book tells at least part of the story of how Americans went from the early 1950s to where we are today.  Henrietta's story is shaped not only by her poverty but by her race and gender. When you know what medical research has accomplished it's easy to think that its all been for the good.  But it's also easy to take the strides we have made for granted.  One of the most touching things about this book was reading that Dorothy Lacks, Henrietta's daughter wanted dignity for her mother, and credit, but not money for herself.<br /><br />I put down the book feeling that today's medical ethics are harder to grapple with than I had ever realized.  But I am so glad that Rebecca Skloot wrote this book both to honor Henrietta, and to give us an understanding of the complicated state of today's tissue research situation.k was reading that Dorothy Lacks, Henrietta's daughter wanted dignity for her mother, and credit, but not money for herself.

B0036B8MXC|4.0|I admit it- every criticism of this show is probably valid - lots of gratuitous sex, nudity, and graphic violence,some uneven writing, a lot of CGI ,and some really laughable lines that I gotta admit grow on me - but I really do like this show. Initially, I thought that the first few episodes focused a bit too much upon the sex and violence, but the recent focus has been more upon the plot, and all the scheming machinations that transformed Spartacus into the historical icon that he has become. In order to make the show interesting, the producers and directors have transformed Batiatus' ludus into a hotbed of intrigue that would rival any soap opera, and any historical accuracy of these events is probably limited to decorative things- although I understand that even there, historical fact takes second place to artistry. That is okay, though. I watch this show for the same reason that I watched \\"Rome\\" and \\"The Tudors\\"- for taking real life events and people and enmeshing them into dramatic situations while adhering to some basic facts of history, and taking liberties with some in order to craft interesting story lines . The realism of these shows differ, so I really don't try to compare them too much. For a scholar's view, I watch the History Channel, or read a good book on the topic. As for the sex and violence, it is not enough to be offensive to me, but some people may not approve, so caution should be used when watching with other individuals who may not share those views. The show is not for everyone- I get into arguments with acquaintances about that- but it seems to me that those who like it really like it, and those who don't really hate it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|We all know how great is the Matrix Trilogy, so I won't write paragraphs about the movie itself. What I do want to point out, however, is that the quality is amazing! I bought the Bluray only so that I can watch it in high definition, and I got exactly what I expected. I've only watched the three feature films so far (no bonus materials or anything like that) and they are all in very good, sharp, clean quality (for example of what I'm praising here, the definition was so high quality, I could see every single pore on Trinity's face and every single layer of makeup on all the actors :O Truly great BD). Also I enjoyed parts of the philosophers' comments as well.
0385504225|2.0|i had to do a multi genre project for this book n boy was it fun. this book was a dissapointment, to say the least. It had too many similiarities with the da vinci code but the da vinci code was much better. the author kept ending his chapters with cliffhangers just to keep u reading. every chapter would be in the same format - ending in a cliffhanger n then the next chapter would start n it would be on the subplot. then a cliffhanger n back to the main plot on n on n on. also, brown ruined all the tense and action packed moments by adding in dull paragraphs about the many tourist attractions wahshington had to offer. for example, langdon n the heroine (another very smart, scienc-y and beautiful lady) were getting chased by helicopters n they ran into the basement of a college so they wudnt be found, brown paused the action to explain what the college was called, what it used to be called, and what classes r offered there today. he did this multiple times and i wondered weather he was trying to be a tour guide of washington or something - it got really anoyying after a while!
B002VECM6S|4.0|A racist movie. It's not about a white family who's on a phoney quilt trip and take in a Black kid to make<br />themselves feel good.<br /><br />This is a story where A REAL CHRISTIAN FAMILY does the right thing - not a family who spent a night at a<br />\\"motel six\\", and then call themselves Christians.<br /><br />This is not a football movie.  It is not a mushy movie with overkill on sentimental values.<br /><br />This is a true story based on the early life of Michael Orr who plays for the Baltimore Ravens.<br /><br />Some say, (sarcasticly), Sandra bullock won awards for this, WELL DUH.  Yep, you usually get awards for fine acting and FINE ACTING is what she did.  This ain't no avatar thank god!  This is what movie making is all about, that is telling a compelling story with lovable and believable characters.<br /><br />This is a feel good movie and it re-enforces my belief that there are still really good CHRISTIAN people out<br />there who care about others. NO MATTER WHAT COLOR THEY ARE.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|J.J. Abrams asked the questions of his creative staff when he began this Star Trek movie odyssey, Can we make it cool? and How can we make it for everyone? He certainly answered the first question in the decidedly affirmative and accomplished the second query when he created this marvelous film. The acting is incredible with actors that have the same magical chemistry working together that the cast of the original Star Trek series had. Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine are perfect mirror images in both demeanor and appearance of Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner playing the starring roles of Spock and Captain James T. Kirk respectively. I was particularly impressed with the versatility of Zachary Quinto's acting skills, because Spock in this film is a vastly different character than the one I have enjoyed seeing him play in the television series Heroes where he is the unpredictable villain-turned-hero Sylar. The rest of the talented cast members do not disappoint either.<br /><br />The second disk in this set is fascinating. It includes deleted scenes which I would love to see eventually incorporated into the film. While they were not absolutely necessary, those scenes added meaning to the storyline of the movie. There are also wonderful interviews and some behind-the-scenes peeks into the creative process of producing this film. There is a casting feature that gives us an insightful look into the complicated process of finding the talented actors willing to make the attempt to fill some big shoes and emulate the iconic actors that started the Star Trek phenomenon.<br /><br />What I loved most was the direction that J.J. Abrams took in developing this new Star Trek adventure. I have been a Star Trek fan since the original series first aired in 1966 when I was 10 years old. My mother, father, brother and I all watched it together as a family every week when each new episode aired. I have seen every episode of all five of the series created for television as well as all eleven now of the movies produced for the silver screen. I was only sad that they did not produce a movie to conclude Star Trek: Voyager with Chakotay marrying Seven-of-Nine. Oh, well! I was devastated, however, when the television producers called it quits after Star Trek: Enterprise. It was my great joy, however, to see J.J. Abrams bypass the problems associated with prequel productions by inventing an alternate time-line for the original Star Trek storyline in this movie. That brilliant maneuver made it possible to create an entirely new and different story while still maintaining the spirit of the original show along with the development of the characters and their relationships with one another. It also leaves the creators with limitless freedom to come up with more new stories. I truly hope that they will not stop with this movie and will go on to give us more Star Trek in series form on television. I and my children have grown up with Star Trek, and I would love to see my grandchildren do so as well. If not, this movie is still a very worthwhile experience, and it was great fun to wander the decks of the Enterprise again.<br /><br />After posting the comments above, I decided to read the other reviews that have been posted here.  I was shocked by the many vehement criticisms of the visual effects in this movie.  So, I have decided to add this postscript.  Personally, I thought the special effects were stunning, but then I am also an avid book reader and a published author, so perhaps visual effects are not as important to me as they are to others who prefer visual forms of entertainment.  Even so, however, the original Star Trek series was never about visual effects.  It was about the well developed stories which included complex larger-than-life characters.  In fact, when the network television moguls tried their best to kill off Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry's budget for visual effects was cut leaving him with little more than cardboard and paper mache to create his sets with.  Cheesy primitive sets still didn't stop the fans from watching the stories created in the ensuing episodes.  Since those tactics didn't work the network canceled the series outright, but did that stop the adoring fans?  It certainly didn't, and the network offices were inundated with literally millions of letters demanding more Star Trek.<br /><br />When the entertainment industry decided that the fans couldn't be ignored, they appropriated proper funding for better visual effects for the movies and new series that followed.  No one will deny that better visual effects make watching Star Trek a lot more fun, but unless you have a great story to tell no amount of money and time spent on visual effects is going to make it worth watching.  This movie is a truly great story.  Even Leonard Nimoy, who had decided that he would never play the part of Spock again after the few episodes he guest starred in during Star Trek:  The Next Generation, was moved nearly to tears when he was presented with this story line and realized that J.J. Abrams and his creative team really understood what the original Star Trek was all about.  Then he enthusiastically put his ears back on and took on the role of his endearing character, Spock, once more.<br /><br />Karen Dearing (Laurel Cain Haws)y primitive sets still didn't stop the fans from watching the stories created in the ensuing episodes.

B0036CWK8O|4.0|I've always been proud to be a member of the metal genre.  Metal fans are the most loyal and devoted of any musical genre-they don't care how old a band is, if they had any chart topping singles, if they are overweight or just plain ugly.  It's the music that matters, and that's what makes the metal scene great.  On the downside of this, some metal fans are the first to jump all over a band's case when the band has done something the fan doesn't like(having a somewhat poppy sounding song on the album, playing a chord that sounds too \\"modern\\", using a drum machine on one track, and many other offenses).<br />Recently I have read some pretty harsh things online about Helloween's new Unarmed cd.  Helloween have been in this boat before back in the day with the notorious Pink Bubbles Go Ape and Chameleon albums, so I'm sure the were expecting this type of reaction.  I love the fact that they don't let it get to them.  In fact, I have seen an interview with Michael Weikath on Youtube where he states(in regards to Unarmed) that a lot of people will hate this album, and he suggests people listen to it before purchasing.  I have never heard a band member say something like that when promoting their new album!  I was rather impressed by that statement.<br />So how is this new album?  Well, it's probably not gonna get a ton of play in my cd player, but damn it, I enjoyed it.  Like the style of music or not, Helloween's having a good time here.  One of the things that's always made Helloween one of my favorite bands is their lighthearted nature, and their ability to not take themselves so damn seriously.<br />As you may already know, Unarmed is a \\"Best Of\\" anniversary album with the band doing non-metal versions of their classic songs.  Faster Helloween songs are now slower acoustic ballads, songs have been converted to a more mellow rock, even jazzy sound.  In fact, some of the songs are so far removed from metal that the intent is obviously to be a bit funny.  It reminds me a bit of what Blind Guardian did with The Forgotten Tales, minus the cover songs from other groups, and a bit more tongue in cheek.<br />Some folks might think Helloween are disgracing themselves.  Honestly, lighten up.  Helloween are a metal band and will continue to be a metal band.  They're not doing this album to become pop stars.  This was just an oddball sidestep meant to be a fun time.....and it really could be if you let it.t Blind Guardian did with The Forgotten Tales, minus the cover songs from other groups, and a bit more tongue in cheek.

B003ELOQD4|5.0|I was at this concert, as well as the show two nights before in Las Vegas.  The concert was streamed live on YouTube (and archived for later viewing for the next week) and of the more than 20 U2 shows I've gone to dating back to the Unforgeable Fire tour, this was best of the lot.   That statistics tell part of the story: this was the biggest show U2 ever played in the US, and the largest show by a single headlining artist in US history.  But that's only part of the story.     While U2 shows are always high energy, this one went just a little bit further. The next to the last show of the tours second leg, they were polished, confident and clearly having a great time.      This is the first U2 live video that will be released in Blu-Ray, and in a rare move for a live concert release, it was taken from only one show.  (Typically, at least two concerts are shot to give more editing choices.)  While this may result is a slightly rougher sound (no second takes - unless they re-recorded them in post), it also gives an even greater sense of being there live in the moment.     More than just a memento of a night at a concert, I'm looking forward for the chance to relive a night that saw one of the best bands in the world completely \\"in the zone\\" and sharing the moment with 100,000 of their friends in Southern California.
B000002LCK|5.0|This is an excellent collection from one of the top electronic acts of the 80s (and really all time).  All the best New Order songs/mixes are here including the extended mix of Bizarre Love Triangle.  If you are a fan of 80s electronic music like Erasure or Pet Shop Boys, you will like this album.  Sounds as good today as it did 20+ years ago.  Not as pop as their later stuff (Substance and beyond) but still palatable for those who are into the lighter/pop stuff they did later in their career.  I think it's a good transition form the Joy Division years to what we've heard from them lately.  Certainly a must for any New Order fan.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|In honor of Easter, I rented the most Christian film I could think of -- Michael Moore's new film, \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\".<br /><br />Not as funny as some of his other films, CALS did cause me to cry several times -- and think hard about our country, our world, and our future.<br /><br />Buying or renting the DVD is actually preferable to seeing the film in a theater (although I imagine there would be some pleasure joining in a lusty chorus of BOO's when Cheney's evil, sneering puss appears on the big screen).  That's because the disc includes a number of additional features that ponder the effects of capitalism on our ecology -- and show a few enlightened companies where workers actually share equally in the profits and decisions.<br /><br />I have to say, I wonder what sort of world we're leaving our children -- and I don't even want to think about the grim fate awaiting our grandchildren.<br /><br />Unless of course your children wind up among the fortunate few in the top one percent -- and then they'll probably be living behind locked, electrified gates in heavily fortified McMansions far from the poor and middle classes from whom they have profited.<br /><br />CALS is essential viewing for every citizen who still believes in the American dream...
B00158K0S8|5.0|On my list of all time greats that I watch over and over and over...Its Patton. I saw it at the theatre at release time, bought the VHS, bought another VHS (I suckered for one of those that claimed \\"extra scenes\\") bought the first CD and now I got the Blu Ray. Outstanding. You wont believe your watching a film done almost 40 years ago. Its real stuff of wartime (hollywood style) right in your face. On the opening sequence with Patton standing at attention with the U.S. flag as a back drop, you can see little beads of sweat coming down from underneath his helmet. The audio is wartime deafening. Louder than hell.. because it was. The Blu Ray version of this movie is outstanding. 10 stars on the wowiekazowie scale. We all know without argument that this movie in itself was a winner right out of the chute. George C. Scott totally nailed it. Karl Malden as well...Amazon needs to separate the reviews for this version of Patton away from those reviews that were written before Blu Ray was released. This version is without question a standalone..
B002WY65VU|4.0|This movie is violent but funny.  Therefore, the violence is not purely gratuitous.  Some of the cinematography is excellent, especially at the amusement park.  As an afficionado of zombie movies, I'd rank this up there with \\"Shaun of the Dead.\\"  All the actors did a great job.  Extras are fine.  This is a movie one can watch repeatedly, which is really the only reason to buy (not rent) a DVD.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|The mounting suspense and twisty plot turns may recall Hitchcock, but the richly paranoid mood, the ambiguous moral compass and especially the climax of this politically driven 2010 thriller are pure Polanski. The 76-year filmmaker has made a polished yarn that brings to mind his career pinnacle, [[ASIN:B000UAE7RW Chinatown]], but the pulpish nature of the material here never allows this film to come near the classic level set by Roman Polanski's 1974 masterwork. Still, it remains crackling good entertainment on its own terms. Based on Robert Harris' 2007 novel, [[ASIN:B000XTGFTS The Ghost]], the story (adapted by Harris and Polanski) wraps around Adam Lang, a renowned world leader who is fighting extradition for past war crimes. Similarities to former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair are purely intentional since Pierce Brosnan's sharply rendered portrayal evokes such comparisons. The handsome, charismatic Lang was forced to resign when he supported a war as a favor to the U.S. President even if it irreparably damaged his reputation at home. Along with his tightly wound wife Ruth and suspiciously efficient assistant Amelia Bly, Lang is staying in a private compound on Martha's Vineyard in order to finish his memoirs.<br /><br />Enter a professional ghostwriter hired to finish Lang's memoirs, an assignment nearly completed when the first ghostwriter is suddenly found washed ashore on the island. The circumstances for his death are unclear, and the new writer is given just one month to spruce up what his predecessor had written. Just as the writer settles into his new role, Lang is ordered by the International Criminal Court to stand trial for handing over four suspected terrorists to the CIA for torture such as water-boarding. The gears are set in motion with the book's deadline pushed up due to the breaking news and the writer discovering information secretly left behind by his dead predecessor. The plot thickens considerably with Ruth playing a pivotal role as she unravels from the crisis and the surprise appearance of a Harvard professor named Paul Emmet whose past association with Lang may implicate the political leader in a burgeoning conspiracy that proves life-threatening to the writer. By the time the puzzle pieces come together, Polanski provides a crescendo that melds the brooding intensity of a mystery with a canny sense of political intrigue.<br /><br />In the title role, Ewan McGregor brings fervent energy to a nameless everyman character whose entire existence appears to rest on the secrets within the manuscript. With subtle force, Brosnan exposes the vainglorious underbelly of the Blair doppelganger, while Olivia Williams sears the screen with fierce intensity as Ruth, a cross between Hillary Clinton, Lady MacBeth and Mrs. Robinson of [[ASIN:B00000F798 The Graduate]]. Polanski is not afraid to cast familiar faces in key roles like Kim Cattrall as Amelia. Initially, it's hard to shake the image of Samantha ([[ASIN:B001DDBCUA Sex and the City: The Movie]]) when she strides onscreen, but the actress sharpens the buttoned-up Amelia with a real edge.  Showing up in effective cameos are Tom Wilkinson as Emmet, Timothy Hutton as Lang's attorney, a nearly unrecognizable Jim Belushi as the publishing magnate who hires the ghostwriter, and 94-year-old Eli Wallach as a beachcomber. Alexandre Desplat ([[ASIN:B001U0HBPG The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]) delivers an appropriately sweeping score, while Pawel Edelman's ([[ASIN:B000FVQLRA The Pianist]]) cinematography produces the right foreboding atmosphere necessary to maintain a tight vise around the mystery.m the crisis and the surprise appearance of a Harvard professor named Paul Emmet whose past association with Lang may implicate the political leader in a burgeoning conspiracy that proves life-threatening to the writer.

B00005JLWN|5.0|Great movie with tons of cool fight scenes. The only mistake the producers made was releasing this movie around the same timeframe as the Matrix which made this movie seem like a knock-off. They are actually two very different flicks and this one is nearly as good as the Matrix.

0805091742|5.0|Correctly applying knowledge to achieve a goal is not automatic; it needs attention and method. In [[ASIN:0805091742 The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right]], Atul Gawande describes two common obstacles to employing available knowledge and demonstrates a corrective method.     One obstacle is that we may forget to perform an important action though we desire to, know the process, and know that it is important. Through routine and boredom, or inattention to precautions, we neglect to do it, or are distracted by the complexity of a situation and lose track, or the knowledge is available to us but we cannot remember it. In such cases, a checklist quickly tells us the critical steps to take.     Airplane pilots were the early inventors of the systematic, and deliberate use of checklists to overcome errors in applying readily-available knowledge. Their efficacy has been repeatedly proved, in the remarkable safety record of modern aviation, including dramatic situations such as the successful landing by Captains Sullenberger and Skiles of an Airbus 320 after both engines were shut down by striking a flock of geese. Checklists have proved their efficacy in fields as divergent as medicine, financial analysis, and restaurant operation.     Sometimes, however, the exact process to achieve a goal is not known, though the knowledge needed to solve the puzzle and discover the process is known, but that knowledge is not all immediately available to one person, but rather parts of it are held by a number of people. In such cases, checklists again play a powerful role because, at the meta level, we do know the process: find the people who have the knowledge, consult and learn from them, and use all that information to arrive at a solution. A checklist of the issues that need to be addressed and the people to consult ensures that we actually perform the process correctly.     In contrast to a \\"to do\\" list of things that we intend to do at some point in the future, a checklist is a list of the essential steps that absolutely must not be overlooked in a particular context. Each context, such as preparing a patient for surgery, analyzing a potential investment, cooking a dish correctly, preparing a plane for takeoff, or landing a plane with dead engines, has its own checklist. Checklists are of two types: DO-CONFIRM and READ-DO. With a DO-CONFIRM checklist, appropriate for familiar tasks, performance is from memory and the checklist is used to confirm than no step was missed. A READ-DO checklist gives and verifies the steps of a less-familiar procedure    When used, checklists have reduced deaths from surgical complications by as much as 47%, allowed top businesses to deliver exceptional customer service, and helped outstanding hedge funds to make decisions with lower risk and more profit. Despite this evidence, however, many people are reluctant to use checklists -- and this provides an opportunity for superior performance to those who do.     ([...])

B0028RXXE8|2.0|I recommend the Hist Channel's \\"ROME: The rise and fall of an Empire\\" instead of this HBO version of \\"Rome\\" if you are truly interested in ancient Roman history as I am. You won't find it on this HBO version of Rome.<br /><br />WARNING: Don't buy this HBO set if you plan to let your children watch it.<br /><br />Do NOT buy this HBO Rome video if you are interested in ancient Roman history or family movie entertainment. This HBO ROME is filled with XXX full nudity, full action sex throughout the entire video and has no historical merit.<br /><br />As an alternative suggestion, the History Channel's Rome video is based on well-researched, accurate historical facts presented in a chronological order as you have often seen shown on the history channel. They also recreate ancient Rome using fully recreated period attire and locations; including a narrative filled with information and recreations of historical events. The History Channel's DVD set is very nicely done and with their usual high quality production if you are truly interested in the history of ancient Rome. It is also less expensive. You can let your children watch the History Channel's video set... But NOT this HBO version.<br /><br />I just think you should know what you are buying especially if you have a family. This is full nudity, full action fornication, close-up, genuine XXX adult p0rn every 5 minutes throughout this entire HBO ROME video. It spends more time on the p0rn than they do the story of Rome. The core video is just a boring soap opera using historical names, interlaced with VERY adult video every few minutes. There is no historical value or movie entertainment value on this HBO video.<br /><br />However, if you like full XXX total nudity and full action p0rn sex on the screen, then this HBO series is for you. I'm not shocked by p0rn and I've seen a few in my time, so I caution you, this HBO ROME video isn't some momentary flash of nudity nor some prudish comment. This is a full action fornication, full lewd nudity p0rn just 2 feet from the camera lens throughout the entire video series. This is no exaggeration. They have a new sex scene every 5 minutes. This is the kind of p0rn you see at the adult book stores with the infamous \\"Stormy\\"... except this is higher quality production which has a soap opera story to go with it. In keeping with modern p0rn, the girls are all trimmed up nicely with preference to fair with plastic surgery upgrades rather than the authentic, unshaven hairy, raven haired Italian girls of ancient Rome.  So much for authenticity...<br /><br />I wanted to see a historical video on Rome... and I guarantee this HBO p0rn version is not it. Even if it did not have the p0rn, it is nothing more than a slow, boring soap opera. It isn't even a good movie. It just slowly drags from one scene to the next about daily events on the road with the Roman army or political discord at the Roman Senate... interlaced with the XXX scenes.<br /><br />This HBO video is presented in a soap opera style so it is not a history lesson. Basically, they created a soap opera scenario about Julius Caesar and the other historical figures of ancient Rome interacting and (literally) lathered it up with HBO sex to attract viewers and recoup the money they spent on the production. They would never have added the lewd scenes if the video itself was of any quality because they would have been concerned about losing their family audience. But the scenes with Caesar, Pompey, Brutus, Anthony, etc., are all just boring soap dialogue of events without historical or entertainment value... so the only way they could have sold this video or kept an audience interest is by catering to those who enjoy raw sex and then package it in a Roman wrapper for marketing. By using this popular ancient roman theme, HBO was also able to fool those of us looking for historical videos about Rome who had no idea it was just a p0rn video in a Roman wrapper. We bought it, now we are stuck with it.<br /><br />When you see all of these rave reviews from other reviewers, consider their ages and gender and what they really liked about this video. I'm sure a lot of these reviewers are young males under 25... and who knows how young some of these commenters are? But there is no doubt this video series will really be a big hit with males of any age and a few females who are into this type of video. Just consider the source of those reviews.<br /><br />As for the kids, I'm sure this was better than national geographic photos for the kids to learn about sex while their parents think they are watching something educational. Pay attention to what your kids are watching! Frankly, I don't know how the stores are getting away with selling this on family video shelves at best-buy and on Amaz0n with no cautions or age requirements about this p0rn content.<br /><br />When I first read the reviews (before I watched the video), I thought it was probably just a few nude scenes and people were overreacting. As I said, I'm not easily shocked and I was interested in a quality historical video about ancient Rome. So with the rave reviews about the quality of this video, I figured a few nude scenes wouldn't be a big deal... but that is not the case with this video. Those reviewers warning of p0rn were NOT exaggerating! If anything they were understating it. It is as bad as they describe and worse! This is a p0rn video which includes a soap opera using the names of ancient Roman figures. There is no historical merit to this video. It is nothing more than a p0rn soap opera using ancient Rome as the wrapper. While they've used some historical events as backdrop, the dialogue and scenes are just soap opera interpretations of how someone in the p0rn industry might interpret daily ancient Roman life.<br /><br />These reviews remind me of those old comments the guys used to make about reading PB magazine for the articles... (and claimed they didn't look at the centerfold). I don't know who they were trying to convince other than to justify why they bought it. It is the same with this HBO set of videos. Don't let someone convince you this video is authentic roman history. It is just an excuse your significant other is using to get you to watch it with them. There is no historical value in this video. It is not about the history of Rome. This is a XXX p0rnographic soap opera with genuine, full action, prolonged full nudity, active, close up, fully exposed sexual fornication on the screen throughout the entire video. This is not just one or two nude scenes. It is the core focus of the entire video.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I'm astonished the stores were selling this for anyone to buy. This must be quite the coupe for those seeking X rated videos in dry areas of the country where there are no adult video stores like the bible belt. Kids can go in and buy it. I didn't see anything stopping minors from purchasing this set other than the price. I can only imagine how many parents have made the mistake of buying this for their family. I wonder how many know what they really bought?<br /><br />I am, however, grateful that I had also bought the history channel's \\"Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire\\" while I was at best-buy. I bought it at the same time I bought this HBO p0rn version of \\"Rome\\". I'm glad I had the other to watch when I found out just how bad this HBO video on Rome turned out to be. I'll save this one with the p0rn collection for that purpose, should the interest occur... because this HBO video is worthless for historical value or even movie entertainment. This is the very reason I cancelled my subscription to HBO years ago. They had turned into nothing but a lowbrow p0rn soap channel because that was all they were producing. They weren't even showing good movies anymore.<br /><br />This production shows that HBO hasn't improved on anything except the amount of money they have to spend on their productions... but even with the higher priced production... it is still belongs in the 86 round file based on total lack of value as entertainment and certainly of no educational value whatsoever. But if you are looking for XXX videos, this would be a better quality production than you could find in the adult video stores. So if you are looking for that kind of video... then this would be at the higher end of adult sex entertainment.same with this HBO set of videos. Don't let someone convince you this video is authentic roman history. It is just an excuse your significant other is using to get you to watch it with them.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|The \\"Castle\\" crew is back and better than ever with 24 new episodes of witty, comedic crime-solving. Season two of \\"Castle\\" brings just as much sass and fun to the crime scenes and murder storylines as the premiere season while still finding the time to delve a bit deeper into the lives and backgrounds of the main players. We learn a bit more about what makes all our favorite characters tick as they work together to unravel the mysteries of New York City murders. Fans of the show will be excited to learn that \\"Heat Wave,\\" Richard Castle (Fillion)'s first Nikki Heat novel based on Detective Beckett (Katic), is in circulation in the \\"real world,\\" appropriately a real-life New York Times Best-Seller. Season two gives the stellar actors and actresses a chance to really find their footing with the characters we've all come to love over the past year. With such distinctly spectacular writing and excellent performances by one and all, it's no wonder that \\"Castle\\" has picked up an even larger following this season. Recent through-the-roof ratings have secured another season for this enormously popular and refreshingly humorous crime procedural.
B001OQCV2E|2.0|Wow, what a GINORMOUS disappointment!  Watching the trailers over and over, I became let's say a little bit obsessed with watching this movie.  The scene where the monk warns the people about the impending flood was so captivating.  Unfortunately it's really the only scene that I enjoyed watching again as I viewed a movie that was both unimpressive in story and overindulgent in effects most likely to make up for the lack in story.<br /><br />Not to give anything or too much away, but connecting the dots through a fantastical storyline just to keep a cast together should be illegal in the movie industry.  Sorry, but you shouldn't be able to make a movie unless the writing actually is both believable and is honest.  Instead we're lead to believe that a sequence of events are happening just because.  ACK!<br /><br />The acting in my opinion was at least on par with the cast that was present and the other star was for, albeit ridiculous to the story, the special effects which were amazing.<br /><br />Pretty much this movie is no more than a ride at Universal Studios, and the action does keep moving things along quite well, so if that's what you're looking for then this movie isn't so bad.  However, just like a comedy where all the best scenes are in the trailer, it's a very disappointing experience.
B001JRB16U|5.0|\\"Mary Poppins\\", first released in 1964 and now in its 45th anniversary edition, is just as charming and entertaining as ever. A sweet-souled children's fairy tale disguised as a Disney musical, \\"Mary Poppins\\" won five Academy Awards for its songs, its then-cutting edge mix of animation and live action, and for the performance of a young Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins.<br /><br />Mary Poppins magically arrives at the Banks home in 1910 London to serve as nanny to the two rather neglected Banks children, Jane and Michael. Firm but fair, the \\"practically perfect\\" Mary Poppins restores order to the nursery through a combination of song and magic, and begins to open the eyes of the children to the possibilities of life and their own imagination. In company with the multi-talented chimney sweep Bert (Dick Van Dyke in top form), Mary and the children embark on a series of adventures that will end up transforming the entire Banks household, headed by a harried banker and his fervent sufferagette wife.<br /><br />Mary and Bert use song, humor, and compassion to set right the Banks household and persuade the parents that family comes first. Don't miss Dick Van Dyke's uncredited performance as Mr. Banks' ancient boss. This two-disc edition includes some superb \\"making of\\" featurettes and interviews with surviving cast members; very highly recommended.
1400052173|2.0|First, let me say that I agree with others that the story of Henrietta herself and her contribution to science is a well-written, compelling story. It's that portion of the book - and that portion only - which merits the two stars for this review.     The rest of this book - the story of Henrietta's family - gets zero stars. It's ironic that Skloot spends the majority of this book shaking a stern finger at the biopharmaceutical industry for \\"stealing\\" Henrietta's cancerous cells and, after spending millions of dollars and thousands of hours growing them into viable cell cultures, \\"selling\\" them for (GASP) PROFIT! It's exploitation the author tells us - sheer, unadulterated exploitation of Henrietta and her family by the biopharmaceutical companies. As evidence of this damaging exploitation, Skloot offers the tale of the sad wreck of a family left behind by Henrietta.    Clearly, this was a family in crisis long before Henrietta even fell ill, and blaming the biopharmaceutical industry is ludicrous. Thus, it's here that Skloot veers horribly off course, and begins her own exploitation of the Lacks family. It's all here - the incestuous \\"marriage,\\" the extensive in-breeding and resultant genetic consequences, the infidelity, the mental illness, the reactionary ignorance and the naked greed. The story is sad, distasteful, fascinating and guaranteed to sell books.      Presumably, Ms. Skloot is profiting from the sale of this book, and unless she plans to share those profits with the Lacks family, this book is nothing more than a brazen example of breathtaking hypocrisy.
B00378OBJ8|5.0|This box set is a real treasure for any fan of classic down and dirty rock n roll. Included exclusively in the box set is a dvd of the white stripes 10th anniversary show called under Nova Scotian Lights. The show is fantastic because of it's raw power. Jack and Meg play for well over 2 hours and every minute of it is a treat. It's shot in black and white but in no way does that take anything away from the show. This is the white stripes at their best. Meg holding down the beat so that Jack can perform his guitar magic. A highlight for me is when they play screwdriver and Jack plays the keyboards giving the song a strong 1970's vibe. There is no doubt that Jack knows his rock n roll history. The box set is well put together. You get the vinyl, cd and 2 dvd's along with a lithograph and a very nice book of pictures. I saw two shows during that tour so I was really looking forward to this release. I can't think of any rock artist his age that can hold a candle to Jack White. My wish is for Jack to produce the next Rolling Stones album. If anybody can get one more classic album out of the stones I believe that Jack White is the only man for the job.

0786838655|4.0|The Lightning Thief is a book that should be read, not missed. It is a fun read and leaves you wanting more Percy Jackson by the end of the book.<br />Though so many have said it is like Harry Potter, I tend to believe it has its relates, but I do not think you should judge the Percy Jackson books that way. Read this book with no expectations and you will love it. You will add it to your bookshelf and read it again.
B003DYGP04|4.0|I don`t think there is any age that would be &#34;too old&#34; for what this sneak preview promises! Once more, Rick Riordan has brought mythology to quite a fascinating place in literature, albeit the similarity this book seems to bear, at first, to the excellent &#34;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#34; series. In fact, Carter and Sadie Kane are two of a fresh batch of well-made characters, as well as being near opposites, and promise a new thrill ride with Rick.    I guess I can`t say too much, seeing as this is a review for a preview, but I am looking forward to the start of The Kane Chronicles!   (Speaking of the title, does this foreshadow perspective changes as the books come out?)
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins Review<br /><br />Rating: 5 out of 5<br /><br />Summary:<br />In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV<br /><br />Review:<br />The Hunger Games was brought up to me when I heard it from everyone around online and personally. I wanted to know what was so great about this 'Hunger' book, so when I arrived at Barnes & Noble, I remembered what to look for.<br />Boy, was I blown away.<br />The cashier looked at me as I gave her the book to ring up and she grinned. I didn't say anything, neither did she until she beeped the book and said \\"You're going to love this book! The third one comes out in August!\\"<br />I smiled and said \\"Thank you. I'm sure I will.\\" and went home to read. I read the first chapter with an O for a mouth and fingers assaulted by paper-cuts. I couldn't stop reading The Hunger Games. I know you won't either. 5 out of 5 Stars. This book is a must read for everyone through ages twelve and above. You'll be mighty hungry for The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />PROS: It is a page turner and will keep you intrigued throughout the whole entire book. The idea is genius, and the writing is incredible.<br /><br />CONS: Violence of teenagers killing one another. I do not think that it will make you close the book, though, no I do not, but that is the con. Truthfully, the book is one of the best I have ever read, though.<br /><br />WHY YOU SHOULD RENT/BUY/READ THIS BOOK : Survival and characterization joins together to form The Hunger Games. It is an intriguing novel with heart-pounding scenes. I will not lie to you and say it is four stars, no, this marvelous masterpiece deserves what I give it: FIVE STARS.
1439190275|5.0|Wow!  This book is great.  The New Atkins for a New You has been revised and updated to provide new clinical studies and to be easier to follow.  I have used Atkins (and probably every other variation of weight loss diet invented) in the past and know that it was the one program that I lost the most on and kept the weight off the longest.  I have always also felt better and had more energy on Atkins than any other program I've followed.  After five years though, I returned to my old ways of eating and regained most of the weight lost.  (On other programs, I was never quite successful at getting to goal and never kept it off more than a few months.  And felt like crap.)  I am now back on the New Atkins program and within a few short days, started feeling much better and know I'm going to get back to goal and keep it off this time.  (I bought both the hardcopy and the Kindle version so I will always have my book with me.)
B003DEMV1Q|2.0|What Jay-Z has been to rap in the 00s, Usher has been to R&B. Both had simply classic albums, and both are masterclasses in their genres that are the gold standard every poser aspires too. They also took breaks after those classic to find themselves in other endeavors, including starting and running their own record labels. However, as we enter 10s, both artists face the problem of staleness and sounding like a poser themselves. Jay-Z mostly failed at this on his last album, so can the new King of Pop live up to the crown?<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Monster<br />OMG<br />Guilty<br /><br />What's most surprising about the album is the lack of good club hits, which is usually where Usher has had the most success in the past. Songs like \\"Lil' Freak\\" just come off incredibly stupid, which makes it almost unlistenable. There are so many moments on this album that are painful, it's hard to remember that Usher used to be a good artist. At least Jay-Z had flashes of brilliance in his last effort. This just has flashes that don't suck. Sexy comes off awkward. Jamming comes off sleepy. Confessionals come off superficial. Plus, every song and the album as a whole just drags so much. It's way longer than it should be, or is considered tolerable.<br /><br />Overall, to lay some truth on you: Jason DeRulo is currently running circles around Usher, quality-wise. Why? DeRulo takes chances with his music, and so far, he's putting out some classic stuff. Usher may be the wise old master with the impeccable voice, but he's stuck in a deep rut of bored material that he simply runs the motions of. The New King of Pop just gave up his crown with his laziest/worst effort yet. I blame Justin Bieber.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It really amazes me when you people bitch and moan about studios double or triple dipping the consumer.  While I do agree that it happens quite a bit, the case is different here.  James Cameron and Fox are being very up front with the releases.  They are explaining each release and what it contains BEFORE any of them are released.  The reason for the first release not containing any extras is because Cameron wanted the film released on Earth Day.  The movie was only released in December!  It became so popular and even though he wants to release the version with the deleted scenes back in, he needs time to finish the visual effects work, the sound, sound effects editing, James Horner needs to compose additional material, etc. It takes time for this to happen if you want a high quality product.  Now, it seems to me that no one has the right to be complaining here about the release.  Complain about the film all you want, but don't bitch about the releases.  If you don't want a particular version of the film, DON'T FRICKIN' BUY IT!!  It truly amazes me how some of you are so inept to understand that.  So, stop complaining, wait for the version you want, buy that and be happy!
B002ZG9788|4.0|If there was ever a film that needed to be remade, then this was it. Sure, the original was good for whoever watched it growing up as a kid in the 80s, but by today's standard the movie is little more than a joke. Fortunately, this film will be relevant for much longer than the original, and Sam Worthington does a much better job than Harry Hamlin.<br /><br />The story follows the same basic premise of the original, with a few tweaks, so it's still an ancient road-trip movie to save the local princess, except this time the film adds a heavy amount of more motivation for Perceus. This time, he's driven by revenge, and his desire to be more man than God. And in this sense, while the story take a little bit too much of the screen time, and there are lulls, the story does a serviceable job creating a cohesive narrative that moves from setpiece to setpiece. The characters are a bit less serviced, and by the time the movie is finished you only really get to know Perseus. Thus when a character dies, you're a lot less inclined to care, since there's a great disconnect between the emotion of the film and its audience. Thus, for me at least, it was simply about the action.<br /><br />And the action is pretty good. Since the larger creatures are just so fantastical it was hard for me to get into those scenes as much, but anytime Sam Worthington has a sword I'm happy. But still, the Medusa scene is one of the film's highlights, and apart from the fact that he looks like a sea monster version of Godzilla, the Kraken does provide a lot of great destruction. Plus, it gives the line that will forever live in the annals of film history in, \\"RELEASE THE KRAKEN!\\"<br /><br />Overall, Clash of the Titans is a mostly satisfying B-movie action matinee, and a great way to kill an afternoon. It may have its problems apart from the action, and I'm not exactly thrilled at a possible sequel, it was a mostly enjoyable two hours, and that's all I can ask from a movie nowadays.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Anybody who thought this movie was going to be the old classic stuffy  Basil Rathbone-type Sherlock Holmes from the 30's & 40's is in for   a rude awakening! Guy Ritchie, the brilliant high-octane very stylized   director or \\"Rock N' Rolla\\" and \\"Snatch\\" fame, takes the helm and takes   the classic characters into the 21st Century with a bang while being very   true to the London in the 1890's time period in which all the original   Sherlock Holmes stories took place.   Robert Downey Jr. was brilliant as the genius sleuth, bringing a quirkiness   and physical edge to it which made it very uniquely his own interpetation.   But then that's just what makes Robert Downey Jr's work so special,   because he has been doing that for over 25 yrs now.    My only point of contention with his performance is in his very affected  1890's London accent...sometimes it was just too affected until you   really had to strain and turn up the volume to understand what he was saying!     Now Jude Law on the hand, an actual born and bred Londoner,   I understood everything he said without a problem! (-:   I loved Jude Law's rendition of Dr. Watson because his Watson   kicks ass and asks questions later!  No mere second banana, he is good-looking, physically fit,   a lover of the ladies, and he'll even go toe to toe with his buddy Holmes,   matching wits & theories. Ultimately though, Holmes is on another wavelength   of genius with his deductive reasoning, powers of observation, and his   razor-sharp timing in bringing it all home in the end.   The supporting cast of players were all very good and brought much comedy,   menace & flair to the film.  Overall, it was Guy Ritchie's vision and direction which brought it  all together and makes for a very enjoyable movie!---I liked it very much.

B001OQCV6A|4.0|SHERLOCK HOLMES a la Guy Ritchie - seems like a non sequitur, but the trade off of Doyle's cerebral manner with Ritchie's visceral visual version makes for a very interesting if at times frustrating film.  The rather silly screen story was hatched by Lionel Wigram and Michael Robert Johnson (who also penned the screenplay in tandem with Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg) and despite the general lack of resemblance of Ritchie's concept of a messy, hygiene-challenged sot of a Holmes (as portrayed by Robert Downey, Jr) the overall result is a Victorian London come alive in a richly colorful way.  Jude Law is placed in the shoes of Dr. Watson and makes them fit despite the original's more dignified persona.  And the ever present quintessential evil - Professor Moriarty - becomes a rather excessively far-fetched immortal presence of Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong), his accomplice is one Lord Coward (Hans Mathesen).  Rachel Mc Adams adds to the flavor of Ritchie's kickboxing fast forward fighting Irene Adler,  and Watson's affianced Mary Morstan is a look-quickly-before-she-disappears Kelly Reilly.<br /><br />To be fair much of the original smart and sharp witted conversations and mind-workings of Holmes have been preserved: the dialog of the author's style comes in quickly delivered digressions amongst the explosions and CGI effects.  The film is a long song and may lose a few to nodding off before the final credits, but stay awake if you can, because the artwork of the credits is startlingly fine!  Grady Harp, April 10
B002ELM5HY|4.0|Mark Knopfler is no stranger to the music scene. His band Dire Straits may be long gone, but he has now released as many albums on his own as he has with the band. Thus comes Get Lucky, his first album on Nonesuch Records.<br /><br />Mark's storytelling skills are still in abundance, and they enable him to paint picturesque tales like the two-in-a-row of \\"Remembrance Day\\" and the title track. There are also good uses of metaphors on here, as evidenced by another two-in-a-row, \\"Cleaning My Gun\\" and \\"The Car Was the One\\". My favorite song though, is the soulful \\"You Can't Beat the House\\".<br /><br />Those people fortunate enough to have picked up the version of the album with the bonus tracks should thus enjoy \\"Early Bird\\" and \\"Time in the Sun\\". In fact, if there were any concern to raise about this album, it would be that a few of the songs have a little TOO long of a musical prelude (see \\"Border Reiver\\", whatever that means; and \\"Piper to the End\\") or reprise (\\"Before Gas and TV\\"), which don't sound bad, but would just feel better at a live performance or something. Oh, well; Get Lucky is still a great album to hold onto.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

0307389839|4.0|\\"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running\\" by Haruki Murakami is an odd little book.  It's a memoir, of sorts, in which Murakami writes about running.  In addition to running, he describes his views on writing novels and compares writing to running.     In this book Murakami rambles a bit as he describes what running means to him.  Even with the rambling, if you enjoy running, you'll enjoy this book.  His obvious passion for running is evident on every page.  Time after time, I found myself relating to his thoughts on running.  He runs most days and has done so for more than 20 years.  At one point in the book he writes about a 100K race he ran, which is interesting.  He also writes about doing triathlons and the challenges involved with doing a triathlon.     I enjoyed this book - I enjoy reading about running.  If you do as well, check out this book.
0891419063|5.0|I first read this book some years ago, when it was out of print but still recognized by many as a first rate journal of man and war.  I trust the HBO series will keep it back in print for many years to come.  Sledge tells his story with a deep sense of humility and respect.  The violence and terror of Peleleui and Okinawa are palpable through his unembellished prose style.  There is no literary enhancement here, no exaggeration, because none is necessary. It leaves readers to marvel at the good fortune of the United States, to be defended by ordinary men who are called upon to engage in extraordinary and dehumanizing acts of selflessness.

Blomkvist--assisted by the titular character, Lisbeth Salander, a young woman with a sordid past--digs deep into this locked-room-island mystery, slowly unraveling a tapestry of evil so vast, so dark, that there may be no escaping its repercussions.<br /><br />It would be easy to accuse THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO of being too long.  The first half of the book is filled with extraneous detail that, here in the States, would most likely be sliced away.  Salander's role doesn't become important to the plot until halfway through; and we get so much intricate Vanger family details, one cannot help but be reminded of THE GODFATHER.  This might make it an uncomfortable read for those interested in your typical murder mysteries.  Do not, however, underestimate Stieg Larsson's novel.  This is NOT a conventional murder mystery; this is a story about the evils of an empire, about a family legacy and social abuse and the consequences of one's actions.  More than just a thriller, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is an allegorical tale of human evil and corruption, one that is just as chilling and memorable as it is engrossing.
B000001G5A|5.0|This is for my taste the definitive performance of Süssmayr´s arrangement   of Mozart´s Requiem. With expansive tempi, maestro Böhm brings us a very  spiritual, powerful, and crystal-clear reading that shows one of the most   apocalyptic and implacable renditions ever extracted from this masterwork.  The Wiener Philharmoniker plays heavenly and soloists staff is a dream-team.   This is a MUST for every Mozart collection.
0743455967|5.0|I was hugely surprised by how great this was. My mom reads all his books and recommended it, but I assumed it would be totally irrelevant for my copywriting. Even though it's not advertising specific, it's about the act of writing from one of the most prolific authors of modern time. His story of humble beginnings is so inspirational, and the tone never comes from a holier than thou place. He bares his routines for all, revealing how a blockbuster author still has the same struggles and flaws as young writers. You cheer for him through the first half of him telling his story. Then he cheers for you.
B002ZG9788|2.0|Clash of the Titans is essentially a watered down version of a live-action adaptation of the God of War video game. Seriously. The only difference is the main character's name. While this could be considered a compliment, it really isn't. A God of War film is pointless now unless they decide to do a full-blown R-rated version of it.<br /><br />Certain other things about the film really bugged me. The main one being that the two main female characters Io and Andromeda cried at EVERYTHING. Every time they spoke it was like they started getting teary eyed. \\"Oh Perseus, I can't follow you into Medusa's lair since I'm not a big strong man like you are. *sob*\\" Just made me want to slap them and go, \\"GET A GRIP, LADY! SHEESH!\\" The biggest pet peeve of mine lies in the finale of the film. Everything regarding Hades and the kraken are dealt with so quickly. The film makes a huge deal about both of them only to have everything wrapped up in less than five minutes when the time finally comes. It just wound up feeling very rushed and anticlimactic.<br /><br />Despite all of the things I found wrong with the film, there were some high points. The CG seemed very all or nothing to me. At times, the effects were fantastic. The giant scorpions scene and the kraken being the best examples. Pegasus is also a great example. The winged horses looked fairly genuine, but they looked kind of odd when they flew. Other times though, it seemed way too obvious that the characters were standing in front of a green screen and fighting with creatures that weren't actually there. There's a scene near the beginning where we first see Perseus as an adult where his father is talking to him and a thunderstorm is beginning to brew. The sky was obviously CG. There were just several moments like that that brought me out of the film.<br /><br />Clash of the Titans was one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year, but fell short and wound up being one of the most disappointing. With mediocre special effects, a sloppy finale, and female characters that will get on your last nerve, the action film fails to live up to expectations. At the end of the day, Clash of the Titans is basically just a glorified Xena: Warrior Princess.inale, and female characters that will get on your last nerve, the action film fails to live up to expectations.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I bought this set (BD/DVD Combo/Digital Copy ONLY because it included a digital copy. We all know that in the future there will be some other standard ie. Blue Ray will go the way of DVD (that pushed out VHS) etc. I was going to purchase the digital version from itunes, but they wanted $19.99 just for the digital copy! Um, the prices for digital copies are getting out of control. I just do not buy it that without a brick and mortar storefront, no shipping, no disk, no cover, no insert, no storage....that the price of digital copies should be MORE or the SAME AS hard copies. The pricing of digital copies should be less, significantly less than the hard copy. And there is no way in hell that the itunes price should be MORE than the Amazon price for BD/DVD/Digital! At $17.99, Amazon is facilitating purchasing of this at all. The movie companies need to be realistic in their prices if they want to discourage people from copying DVDs, ie. stealing them. The Amazon price seems more than fair. Bottom line is that if customers pay $19.99 for digital copies, then the price will stay the same. I hope movie execs read this. If you include a digital copy with your BD/DVD sets, price it in the $15-$19 dollar range, I will buy more movies. Am I the only one?
B00337KM2S|3.0|I had really high expectations of this film after all the hype, critical acclaim, and award nods - but the reality for me was that this is just an average film.  Clooney is just Clooney (read Danny Ocean) and, although the idea had legs, I don't think the writing was all that clever, provocative, or funny.  Anna Kendrick is the only bright spot in an otherwise somewhat blah picture and the only element of the movie that deserved any nominations this award season.
0743497465|5.0|I was skeptical about reading that early book by Dan Brown and I was wrong. This book is a real entertainment. It brings together two levels. Political fiction on one side and cosmic science on the other. The cosmic science of the book is based on a false scientific debate about the efficiency and honesty of NASA and state research in that agency. The message is contradictory. The best scientists and yet the worst bureaucrats and that gives financial waste and inefficiency. How can NASA recapture the imagination of the public? By finally discovering the proof of extra-terrestrial life, no less, no more. And then we have there a real thriller about the authenticity of a so-believed meteorite. But this is only the tip of the iceberg visible beyond the Arctic Circle. The real stuff is a plot around a coming presidential election with the confrontation of a weak but honest incumbent president and an ambitious senator who aims at privatizing NASA, because he gets kick-backs from private spatial contractors. The plot is to give a scientific and cosmic push to the incumbent and to save the public agency known as NASA. There the plot runs into and against scientific resistance and even resistance from the daughter of the senator, who is an important agent in the secret security services. But the various stakes are to bring the truth to the public after stopping the plot, then to make the revelation beneficial to the incumbent president and hence save NASA, and finally destroy the dangerous senator who is ready to do anything to win the election, even against the best interest of the country. Stephen King in The Dead Zone had done a beautiful novel with the same aim to destroy a dangerous senator trying to get the presidency under his control. But here Dan Brown goes further and I must admit his solution is a lot sexier. But Dan brown has always liked sexy situations emerging from deeply sadistic crises. Quite an entertaining book altogether.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDsity Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID

B000ZM1MGE|5.0|This film is a manifesto in many ways and will remain a classic. A manifesto against drug trafficking. This activity is absurd, silly, only dictated by greed at all levels for something that has no justification whatsoever.<br /><br />And yet the real cause of the drama is in the tolerance some - like the father or the girl friend - have in front of the moderate use of such substances. But it is also a manifesto against the only answer that is leveled at that problem, in this case in Turkey, but it is not better anywhere else as for that, and that is repression.<br /><br />Repression makes the activity dangerous, hence all the more attractive because it becomes pure sports. What's more it is a manifesto against the cruelty of the punishment. The only objective of it is to make the person suffer physically first of all and to enjoy the slow and brutal degradation of the person. It also creates a social microcosm among prisoners that aims at developing fear and hatred.<br /><br />At the same time the surrounding microcosm of the prison wardens is a descent into a sadistic hellish cloaca that cannot in any way be redeemed. It is finally a manifesto against justice, and not only Turkish justice. The representative of the US consulate, or the lawyers, local or not, are not better.<br /><br />At the end we just wonder what we could do to really avoid the sadistic spiral of that vengeful vision of social management. And the only answer seems to be \\"escape\\". As far away and as fast as possible from justice, prisons, drugs and all the rest, maybe even humanity itself.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B00328G4V6|3.0|C'mon, how many times have we heard Red House.  And a ragged version of 'Fire', sheesh.  And they say there is still more to be released but this is all they can give us.  The Hendrix legacy will always be the first album JHE, Bold as Love, and Electric Lady Land.  You have to know by now they are just squeezing the last utter drop out of what's left.  I will say the sound of the recording is quite good, even excellent.  But I dare say, its old.  Not good old, just old.  Musicians have moved beyond even the talent of Jimi these days, as this sounds like a garage band with a badd-ass strat player singin sub par tunes.  Not to take away from the guy.  He was a miracle in 67 and 68. But guitarists copied, learned it, and went forward.  And I'm not sure if Jimi had the tunesmith in him to keep up if he would have lived.  I now can safely say there is no wondrous Hendrix 'Vault'.  The Grateful Dead has a Vault, a real vault that will likely be spawning legitimate releases when our grand kids are old (I think they really have that much tape). Anyway, I like this Neptune CD cause I here Jimi kickin the heck out of his guitar here and there.  I'm not a naysayer, just bein real. And I still love Jimi. But stop this nonsense of buildup equating to the importance of the dead sea scrolls.
078401213X|5.0|A strange black and white movie about a mathematician who believes everything in nature is mathematical and patternable, including the Stock Exchange. He meets with the Jewish numerical ideology of the Kabbalah and that does not improve his vision. The result is explosive and of course proves what is supposed to be proved, viz. the vanity of mathematics and mathematicians. A film that is interesting only to those who have a certain amount of scientific and technological orientation. And from the very start it is shown as a disease that is the result of the illumination you get when you penetrate some mathematical secret: the same as when you watch the sun, which makes you blind at first and then leaves you with severe headaches when the blindness recedes. In other words a film that orients you rather towards the graceful and slow spiritual dancing of the Chinese in China town.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

6305313687|5.0|A film that is supposed to be cultish and to be anti-racist. It is true there are some interesting scenes in the first four fifths of the film. But the last part, after the nocturnal confrontation of the two brothers around what happened to Derek in prison goes its own way and leads to a message that is absolute despair. \\"What have I done?\\" says Derek on the dead body of his brother. He has in fact done nothing at all but exploited a manipulative situation that was rotten from the start and made him the victim of bigotry. But Derek was redeemed in prison. His brother was redeemed by Derek's tale of what happened to him in prison and by the black principal of the school. The two white boys were redeemed. But the black boy was not, could not be and he killed and was unerasably and permanently sprayed with the blood of his prey and the final vision of a completely red Pacific Ocean of forever waxing and waning blood leads to a meaning of fatality that will never end. Racism is forever because the black victims of white racism will never be redeemed and will never forgive. And why should they? The an eye for an eye law of this society is forever and the film suggests no way out from that eternal vengeful apocalyptic vision, not even an escape.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

B002OXANO4|1.0|I LOVE Queen. They are one of my favorite bands. That's why I'm painfully giving this new Queen collection 'Absolute Greatest' one star. Read on for further details.    In 2009, Queen released their umpteenth compilation, 'Absolute Greatest.' A career-spanning retrospective, the record spans many classic tracks of theirs, including a track from their incredibly underrated 1995 record, 'Made in Heaven.'     This record is a cash cow. That's the bottom line. If you have 'The Platinum Collection: Greatest Hits I, II & III' and 'Classic Queen,' plus the studio records, you have this already. It's a massive ripoff from Queen and the folks at Hollywood Records. How disappointing -- it seems Queen has to release a compilation rehashing all of their classic tracks every several years or so.    If you thought 'Stone Cold Classics' was bad, you'll probably flinch at the sight of this. 'One Vision' is horrendously edited, chopped down to 3:59 as opposed to the classic 5:11 studio version. That's one of my favorite Queen songs -- and what a shame that this collection offers it edited. 'Greatest Hits II' and 'Classic Queen' suffer the same problem -- 'Queen Rocks,' it seems is the only collection that offers this song in it's full-length album version.    Overall, don't buy this record. It's Hollywood Records once again trying to deprive you of your hard-earned dollar by making you pay for another useless Queen compilation. If you are new to Queen's legendary catalogue, start with 'Greatest Hits I & II' or perhaps if you want to take it a step further 'The Platinum Collection: Greatest Hits I, II & III.' And, better yet, you could buy all of the studio records, which is definitely the best way to listen to Queen.    But don't buy this record. By buying this, you're simply encouraging Hollywood Records to rehash the same material AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. I can almost guarantee you this set will be out of print, by, say 2013.     NOT RECOMMENDED.

B001N1DPDE|3.0|I'm not entirely sure how to do this knife justice within a five star rating system. It's very good for what it is, the question is what is it? As others have mentioned, it's a whopping quarter inch hunk of 1095 steel fashioned into a short brute of a knife shape. As near as I can tell, the knife itself is made in the USA, whereas other online sources indicate that the very well designed and executed sheath is made in Taiwan. The sheath itself deserves some commentary as I feel that it's easily worth maybe half the cost of the $63 knife/sheath system. The blade snaps solidly into the plastic sheath and the retention is good enough for inverted carry even without using the provided nylon grip snap retainer. The heavy duty sheath is also fully ambidextrous.     The plastic handle is retained by allen bolts with nuts and it's a good thing they're user tightenable, since the handle loosened up almost immediately with some batoning through hickory kindling. The blade is certainly robust enough for plenty of batoning through wood, yet at only 5.25\\" long, it's too short for batoning through much over about 3\\" wood or so. Yet, it's short length makes it relatively easy to carry on one's belt. When using it to whack and chop, I found it to be particularly bone jarring, and it's short length makes it a very inefficient chopper, even though it's quite heavy for it's size. I've seen comments to the effect that this would be a better knife with thinner micarta handle scales, and I agree, but at that point, it might well become as expensive as an Ontario Rat 5, which in my opinion, is an all around better knife for most purposes.    Some have said that the Campanion works as a kitchen knife. That's true as far as it goes, but nearly any dedicated kitchen knife or cleaver one happens to have is a superior slicer, and dicer due to the extreme thickness of the Campanion and the resulting obtuse bevel. Edge retention on the 1095 blade is only so-so.     The Amazon blurb that describes this as \\"lightweight\\" is hysterical. At nearly a pound (14.6 ounces), this knife is actually heavier than some lightweight tomahawks and hatchets. That brings up the question of whether one is better off with a lightweight puuko, or even a Becker Necker, combined with a light hatchet, machete or 'hawk, and in my opinion, the answer is most definitely. I like the Becker Campanion, but honestly can't think of too many scenarios where it would be my first choice in a carry knife. I'll probably use this one as a backup knife left in the vehicle for any situations in which, for whatever reasons I either don't have something more suitable with me, or want a knife that can be used as a beater. It's a good solid tool that should last for several lifetimes. I recommend it with reservations, though.

B00337KMAA|3.0|George Clooney has earned his way into the category of trusted actor. It happened on the last feature I saw him in, Michael Clayton. Afterwards, I decided the films he takes on are worthy, period. There are few other actors in this category. Renee Zellwiger, Morgan Freeman, Christopher Walken, Jeff Bridges. The point is, Clooney chooses his projects wisely. Aside from 'Oceans', which he does for camaraderie, Clooney has climbed to the top, several steps above his previous status of 'charismatic with face value'.<br /><br />'Up In The Air' finds George in the curious role of Ryan Bingham. Employment for Ryan is dependent on the expendibility of fellow professionals. He is a hired gun, who terminates and transitions employees for companies who would rather outsource their blood-letting. Ryan lives comfortably out of a carry-on suitcase. He has mastered the art of transition, thus he is an expert at what he does.<br /><br />Back at the home office, Ryan's boss (Jason Bateman) has hired a recent firestorm of a grad (Anna Kendrick), who has plans on modernizing the way his company does business. Ryan is tasked with taking her on the road and indoctrinating her into his way of doing things. Along the way, Ryan's latest partner in the mile high club (Vera Farmiga) slowly evolves into something more. Transition is the major theme of 'Up In The Air'. That takes on many contexts in this fine drama fused with romance and comedic splashes.<br /><br />'Up In The Air' is directed by Jason Reitman, who previously helmed the outstanding 'Juno' and a favorite of mine 'Thank You For Smoking'. Reitman is quite good at dealing with everyday situations coupled with exceptional dialogue. The actors are allowed the latitude to expand their characters while remaining on a smart pace. This occurs when room for expression is granted yet not allowed to linger. This fine line can also be observed in the editing which is very good as well.<br /><br />As stated Mr. Clooney has elevated his stature, yet his supporting cast is undeniably outstanding. Vera Farmiga is truly wonderful as Mr. Clooney's mirror image throughout. She has a great script to indulge in and appears comfortable matching wits with Clooney. I also thought that Anna Kendrick was perfect for the role and spot on from her first scene to the last. Hers is a new world of a matter of fact 'company man' on the rise. Jason Bateman turns in another fine performance as Clooney's supportive but realistic boss. His previous role in 2009's 'State of Play' saw him scaling new heights as well.<br /><br />The DVD is available in Blu-ray as well as regular DVD. It plays with a crystal clear picture and sounds great (screened on a Sony BVD-360 with a Samsung 40\\" 1080p HD set). Special Features include commentary from the director, Jason Reitman, and deleted scenes.undeniably outstanding. Vera Farmiga is truly wonderful as Mr. Clooney's mirror image throughout.

His style seems so effortless...a good story with people we care about, yet we know how rare that is.  Wish we had a longer list of his books to look forward to.
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins' Catching Fire picks up where The Hunger Games left off. Katniss and Peeta are compelled to run their victory laps around Panem's twelve provinces, giving uncomfortable speeches to audiences that include the family members of tributes they killed in the arena. Meanwhile, as victors they'll have a role--a larger one, as it turns out, than they might have supposed--in the upcoming games: the games are bigger this coming year, or rather, they come with a surprise, since it's the 75th anniversary of their institution. All of this plays out against a backdrop of growing unrest in the provinces: Katniss has unwittingly become a symbol of rebellion because of her refusal to play by the rules as a tribute. On a personal level, she remains torn between Gale, her hunting partner and would-be suitor, and Peeta, whose love for her is the talk of Panem. Catching Fire is a worthy sequel to The Hunger Games. It's almost as unputdownable as the first book. The plot offers surprises, but the direction the story takes makes good sense. And, as with the first book, reading Collins' prose is like drinking water, it goes down so smoothly.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
0061922315|5.0|This extraordinary first novel tells the parallel stories of two familes, one in India, one the the US. The families are intimately linked by the eponymic child. The book begins by establishing that the birth of a daughter in parts of India is a tragic event, almost inevitably followed by the murder of the girl. This mother, however, heroically walks three days to bring her daughter to the nearest orphanage.  The American couple falls in love with the girl from a distance and adopts her.<br /><br />The Secret Daughter is a compelling study of both cultural and family/emotional issues. Shilpi Somaya Gowda is the Canadian daughter of immigrants from Mumbai, who volunteered for a year in an Indian orphanage and who now lives in the States. Writing in the very difficult to execute present tense omnipotent third person,  she couples her personal experiences to a gift for narrative in telling this vivid character study.<br /><br />The book begins with a compelling and horrific flashback to the birth of a first daughter wrenched from the mothers arms by her own husband, immediately after its birth. Girls are an expense uncompensated by an ability to work in the field. The impotence of Indian women is on full display as she engagees in tiny acts domestic insurgency  such as overspicing his meal; and all of this sets up her nearly preternatural strength-of-resolve when she becomes pregnant a second time. If this is a girl, her husband will not have the child, regardless of the risk. Just when you think you're on a well trod narrative path, Gowda takes you back to the moment when the husband gave the first child over to be put to death, and you wittness his unexpected but all too human agony.  The message of the critical importance and value of family underlies her entire narrative.<br /><br />My only complaint, albeit a trivial one, is that it would have been very helpful to be alerted to the glossary provided at the end of the book.  As it was, by the time I found it, I no longer needed it.<br /><br />That said, this novel is highly recommended, especially, as the publishers note, for fans of Kim Edwards and Thrity Umrigar, Sara Green, Jhumpa Lahiri and Kathryn Stockett.That said, this novel is highly recommended, especially, as the publishers note, for fans of Kim Edwards and Thrity Umrigar, Sara Green, Jhumpa Lahiri and Kathryn Stockett.
0790731509|5.0|Released in 1967, COOL HAND LUKE was among a wave of 1960s and 1970s films--BONNIE AND CLYDE, EASY RIDER, and ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST to name but a few--to present the classic David and Golitath story of a likeable rebel going up against established powers. In these films, however, David rarely overcame Golithah; he was instead destroyed and we the audience were left to admire his courage and despise the powers that destroyed him. In the case of COOL HAND LUKE, based on a 1965 novel by Donn Pearce, the hero was a World War II veteran who, for reasons of alcohol, amused himself by cutting the heads off parking meters in a small southern town--and consequently finds himself doing time on a chain gang. He also finds himself incapable of following the rules, and it doesn't much matter what the rules are; he is a born rebel, a never-say-die fighter, a man who simply cannot turn from a path once he has set foot upon it. And from his first day the powers that be are determined to rob him of all humanity and break him of all self-respect.<br /><br />Like ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, most of the film plays out like a comedy, with a host of memorable characters as both prisoners and guards. On the prisoner side the cast includes George Kennedy (who picked up a Best Supporting Oscar for his work here), Dennis Hopper, Wayne Rogers, and Ralph Waite, to name but a few; on the guard side is the truly memorable Strother Martin, who runs the county farm with the assistance of brutal killers. Jo Van Fleet and Joy Harmon also shine, the first as Luke's tough but dying mother, the second as a country girl who decides to give the chain gang a treat by washing her car in the most seductive manner possible. The cast is a director's dream, and Stuart Rosenberg makes the most of it; although most of his previous experience was with television, and although his later films are hardly worth mentioning, he gets the most out of the actors and script, and the result is... both hilarious and bitter, comic and painful, and ultimately incredibly ugly.<br /><br />The atmosphere captures the feel of a county \\"farm\\" prison and a chain gang in an uncomfortably realistic way; I was born and raised in the deep south, and I can attest to the fact that such beat up shacks, brutal punishments, and chain gang labor was common well into the late 1970s--and in some instances are only now beginning to be uncovered and prosecuted. The film is also rife with covert references to homosexuality, a fact that seemes to have gone of the heads of the censors of the day but resonated with audiences in a \\"boys will be boys\\" sort of way. But the thing that makes COOL HAND LUKE such a winner is Paul Newman's spectacular performance in the title role and the humor he and the rest of cast brings to the film--from card games to egg eating contests, from escape attempts to outwitting the guards. But as Luke learns the hard way, one can only outwit the guards so many times, and when the establishment wants you broken, you're broken, and when the establishment wants you dead, you're dead. Sometimes we need to be reminded that cinema can be much more than just eye candy--happy dragons and CGI effects and other such foolishness. It's a cruel world we live in, and it hasn't changed much since Newman and company stepped before the cameras to make this film.<br /><br />You'll laugh at Luke and his prison mates. You cringe at the guards with their icy eyes. You'll cry. You'll be outraged. And although it is a painful trip, when the movie ends, you won't regret having taken it. Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerbitter, comic and painful, and ultimately incredibly ugly.

B001UV4XWY|4.0|Imagine, your family needs money. It is 1976. The wallpapers in your house are desperately in need of changing. More expensive things are up too: medical treatment for mother (a surprisingly strong Cameron Diaz)-- no health care reform yet!; son's education getting more expensive after a discount is cancelled; father does not get a job that he had counted on... A man with half a face (Frank Langella, with Nixon's voice) shows up and offers you a deal: one million dollars for pushing a button in a box. Somebody somewhere will die, but you will not know who... But you may not tell nor ask..<br />One sees easily that this is a brillant basic concept.<br />Unfortunately the script spoils the grand idea by turning it into an alien story. If one ignores all the hokus pokus, the film is still very interesting, just not as good as it could have been.<br />Based on a story by the writer of I am Legend (unless I got the name wrong).<br />And Cameron Diaz looks like Hanna Schygulla in her best years (appropriately so, this is 1976 after all!) She is a teacher and seems to teach literature. We attend a class on Sartre's Huis Clos. That's weird.
0316069906|4.0|\\"Eating Animals\\" explores a subject that's nagged at me for my entire life. As an animal lover, I find the killing of animals disturbing, so the detached anti-septic presentation of meats at the grocery store provided the disassociation I needed to eat them. This book and a look at [...] quickly bring back the cognitive dissonance.    Foer is particularly effective because he transcends the PETA-inspired manifesto. \\"Eating Animals\\" argues against factory farms not just because it is a miserable life for the animals, but also because of the risks to the consumers' health and the far reaching effects on the environment.    \\"Eating Animals\\" is scattered in its presentation. Yet that allows it to be conversational and easy to read, which is necessary because it is not a \\"feel good\\" book.

0307266303|5.0|Seriously, this is an amazing page turner. It has inspired me to start running again (this time barefoot). However, there is a major disconnect I hope McDougall recognizes and addresses at some point: he spends part of the book explaining how a vegan/raw diet is the best possible for health, disease prevention, etc, and then goes on to explain how humans were made to run after large game animals, literally exhausting their prey to death. If we are built to eat mainly plants, his \\"born to run\\" argument falls apart (you don't need to run very fast after an asparagus). Be that as it may, the book is a pure joy to read, and highly recommended for runners and non-runners alike.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Despite the fact that this was filmed in just 33 days, Moon is an excellent motion picture. As others have noted, it was at first easy to believe that Moon would be all too similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey; but I too am happy that I was wrong. Yes, there are some similarities but the plot is so different and the sci-fi/horror/thriller elements so original and inventive that Moon works on all levels. The acting is superb and the casting was very well done; the cinematography and the choreography work wonders for the film. The script was well written and the action move along at a good pace although they could have edited this down just a few minutes to make the action and the plot a bit tighter. However, this is a minor detail.<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who, at some point in the future, has been assigned to a three year solo mission on the far side of the moon to \\"harvest\\" helium-3 for cleaner energy; and he sends it all back to Earth as his bosses at Lunar want him to do. Sam has only his robot named \\"GERTY\\" for company; and yes, there are some similarities between GERTY and HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey but by the end of the picture you'll see that these are two different robots.<br /><br />With just two weeks left to go, Sam is eager to go home. Indeed, he is so lonely that he talks to his plants and watches with frustration the sporadic one way-feed, incoming only video messages he gets from his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and their young daughter Eve (Rosie Shaw) back on Earth.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one day on an expedition outside the base, Sam has an accident with his vehicle and he awakens to find himself in the base's infirmary. It's not long after that Sam discovers that there is in fact someone else on the base with him after all--and who is also named Sam (Robin Chalk)! This shocking discovery creates riveting drama with thriller features and creativity that impressed me very much. Although it may seem as if I've given too much away, there's actually much, much more to the plot and I won't provide spoilers to keep it interesting for you.<br /><br />The DVD comes with some nice extras. There are two optional running commentaries; and I particularly liked the \\"making of\\" featurette. In addition, Kevin Spacey does a great job of providing the voice for GERTY.<br /><br />Moon is one of those rare, somewhat softer sci-fi thrillers that gradually pulls you in and then never lets you go until the very last moment of the picture. I highly recommend this film for people who enjoy sci-fi, thrillers with drama and even mysteries. You won't be disappointed!n too much away, there's actually much, much more to the plot and I won't provide spoilers to keep it interesting for you.     The DVD comes with some nice extras.

B000C65Z1G|3.0|I found \\"The Constant Gardener\\" to be a standard suspense movie.  There's a fair amount of mystery and intrigue but, frankly, I was more impressed with the location shots in Kenya.  The only reason that I thought to write some comments about \\"The Constant Gardener\\" was the politics involved.  This could be one of those teachable moments that enlightens how two sides of a story could both be correct.      There's an aspect to \\"The Constant Gardener\\" that involves pharmacutical companies dispensing their products on Third World countries prior to the normal length of research that takes place before such drugs can be introduced in the USA.  The suggestion is made that this early availability is terrible and is happening solely for the benefit of greedy indutrialists.  While watching these developments I couldn't help but think of the early days of the AIDS epidemic.  There were no drugs that could cure the disease back then but there were drugs in various stages of promising research that might eventually help.  The pleas of dying suferers went in vain because the FDA could not OK a new drug until all extensive studies had been successfully completed.  I recall that, in time, some restrictions were eased somewhat but the rigorous standards of the FDA continue to persist.  So, is the release of drugs that have laboratory-proven results but without the conclusive, time-consuming studies a crime? Or is it an effort to reach impoverished remote areas with epidemic levels of lethal diseases?  I kept thinking how the other side of the story was totally ignored and that greed was shown to be the only motive involved.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Trying to watch episodes recorded from the Discovery Channel but the narration is so poorly done by a person that lacks the correct voice tone to do so and then talks down to the viewers.      Funny how Discovery also does not mention the format - recall that the Discovery version of Planet Earth was only in 1080i whereas the BBC used the higher quality 1080p.  I happen to have both versions of Planet Earth and in several scenes the difference in video quality and definition is very obvious. The Discovery version also has fewer scenes than BBC due to more commercials in U.S. causing them to cut the run time although the Discovery version of Planet Earth did have more special features presumably to fill the time on Discovery HD Theatre which did not attract as many advertisers.    It is your choice but my experience has been so negative that I will avoid the Discovery version in favor of the significantly greater quality of the BBC version.

0143170104|3.0|While I enjoyed this book, it didn't flow as well as the first book. Also there were 2 big issues that I had with this book. The first deals with hack writing techniques - improbable things happening to make the plot move along. For instance, someone hasn't seen someone for 2 years, then just happens to walk near this person as something bad just happens to them - with a time frame of about 30 seconds for them get personally involved. Or everyone always having their cell phones off so someone can't call another person to warn them or ask for help, or for some other reason that moves the plot along. Almost every policeman in the book has their cell phones off some or most of the time, but this almost always only happens when they are needed. I know some police detectives. This is unheard of. These are just 2 of the many examples of poor writing tricks.<br /><br />The last thing that I don't like about the book is not really wrong per se. It is just a pet peeve of mine. I feel that in a straight forward book like this, the length of the ending and resolution should be in proportion to the length of the novel. The book is just over 500 pages, but ended abruptly. In just a few paragraphs. In fact, it really wasn't even an ending. There were a lot of loose end that didn't get tied up, and characters that were involved in the final parts of the books were suddenly dropped from the very end without resolution. Compare this book with \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", which closed everything out nicely. The first book gave a much more satisfying ending.
0061703257|1.0|Can't help it, I feel cheated.  I'd never read Lehane, but a friend of mine saw the movie and said it was so great.  I had my Kindle [[ASIN:B0015T963C Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6\\" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)]] at the table and she wanted to see the fast download, so--I asked for Shutter Island.  There it was, a sample in just seconds.  I thought, what the heck, I may as well read it.  The start was strong. I downloaded the book.  Big mistake.  The farther along I got, the more cheated I felt.  Hey, the convenient hurricane?  Page by page things got worse until finally the insult of the last chapter.

0446401307|4.0|Originally created as a 16-part serial for the New York Times Magazine, The Overlook is a fast-paced, straight forward, easy-to-read 225-page Harry Bosch novel.  The Overlook is a follow up to Echo Park and Bosch is reunited with FBI agent Rachel Walling.      Stanley Kent, a medical physicist, has been murdered execution style and 31 vials of radioactive cesium are missing.  The cesium could be used to create a deadly dirty bomb.  National security is at risk and the FBI is trying to squeeze the LAPD and Bosch out of the investigation.     The FBI contends that the terrorism threat trumps the murder investigation.  Bosch disagrees.  He believes murder is the key to the case.  He senses a great deal of misdirection going on and he has to prove his point, working outside the normal channels, of course.    This is a quick, but satisfying read.
B0039UTDA6|1.0|I have to agree with other reviewers here.  Why they changed the narration on this documentary is beyond me.  Oprah's reading comes across as stiff and stale.  The narration with Sir David Attenborough is rich and warm.  His descriptions actually pull you into the beautiful cinematography.<br /><br />When I heard this documentary was coming to American television I was excited.  However, I was soon disappointed to learn of the narration change.  I was unable to listen to Oprah's readings during the first episode.  I decided to buy the original series from amazon.co.uk instead to watch in my region free player.  I am glad to see that a North American version of the original will be released the same date as this version.  I recommend strongly that you stick with the original version narrated by Mr. Attenborough.

0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis has an incredible gift of taking complex issues and synthesizing them into easily digestible, engaging narratives that entertain as well as informs his readers.  \\"The Big Short\\" describes the recent collapse of the financial market at the hands of subprime lending.  Lewis relates the rise and fall of subprime lending through the stories of three groups of investors that grasped the potential consequences of what would happen should borrowers begin to default on their loans.  Utilizing credit default swaps, these investors were able to buy insurance at pennies on the dollar against the default of the residential mortgage bonds backed by portfolios of individual subprime loans.  Once the subprime loans started failing, the bonds would default and the holders of the credit default swaps collected on the entire value of the bonds that defaulted, as if they owned the bonds.  This enabled investors to make bets on specific bonds defaulting and paid on huge multiples of these bets once these bonds collapsed.  As many people have described it, it was like an investor buying fire insurance on their neighbor's house.  If the house burnt down, they would collect the payment for the insured value, even though they did not experience any direct losses because of the fire.<br /><br />Lewis goes into detail to describe everyone's role within these transactions but places a significant amount of the blame on the investment banks.  Published in 1989, Lewis' first book, \\"Liar's Poker,\\" offered readers in inside glimpse into the world of investment banking.  At that time, nearly all investment banking firms were privately held partnerships, thereby exposing only the individual partners to the risks the firms took on.  Today, nearly all investment banking firms are publicly traded companies.  This dramatic change in ownership structure has created a huge moral hazard issue whereby the firms have an incentive to take extreme risk in order to participate in the upside of the trade, but do not have to worry about the economic consequences if the trade does not pan out.  This is precisely what happened once the subprime market collapsed.  The economy was already heading towards a recession due to the drop in residential home values.  The entire destruction of the economy was a direct result of the collapse of the house of cards the investment banks created.<br /><br />Like all of Lewis' previous works, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone.e, but do not have to worry about the economic consequences if the trade does not pan out.

B002XTXG1G|4.0|4.3 stars<br /><br />The real-life Bronson is quite a celebrity in Britain, apparently, but I'd never heard of him across the pond until this wild film. Director Refn's unique vision and Brady's incredible performance as Bronson make this a truly special film that will delight some and no doubt sicken others. In any case, it's a piece of cinematic brilliance that raises all sorts of questions and answers almost none of them, with much drama and glee.<br /><br />This guy is the very definition of sociopath, yet he's a hero to many in his native country. My main question in watching this is how do the guards get suckered into his grasp time and again; certainly a very different prison system from America's, where this sort of fellow would be shut down immediately. Yet the willingness to try to fathom Bronson's mind and heart are what perhaps makes Britain a more humane place. Or maybe not, when criminals have more rights than their victims? Yet another quandary hardly even addressed here. Like most of the judgments, it's up to you.<br /><br />What is certain is that Hardy and Refn gave this their all, and the various weird but effectively matched techniques that Refn uses are always in keeping with Brady's oddly nuanced performance. There's plenty of violence, but it's all realistic, non-Hollywood bare-knuckle stuff, with hardly a gun fired. The violence will be too much for some, but as much as I don't love violence I thought it was well done here and always worked towards the film's message. Still not sure what that is, but it was a trip to watch it all play out.<br /><br />Beautifully shot and thoroughly ugly at the same time, Bronson is one of a kind, and Brady's star turn is one of the most bravura acting jobs I've seen in years. If you can stomach a fair bit of fisticuffs, and a look at a mind that's unlike any you've ever encountered, Bronson may be an experience you'll not soon forget. And rarely will you feel better about law enforcement, knowing that society does well to have places to keep folks like Charlie well away from everyone else.ep folks like Charlie well away from everyone else.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|It was the most despicable parody & denigration of the Star Trek concept, that a thousand nightmares could have conjured up.

B002ZG9788|1.0|Zzzzz... yet another movie with terrific CGI, a garbled plot, no human emotional connection, and a mixed bag of awful to above average acting.  I actually started to fall asleep at various points in this movie....<br /><br />One's senses are not quite as assaulted as with \\"Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen\\", but this movie falls into that same class of an action movie hyped mainly for its special effects and yet unable to hold our attention just on that basis.  Yes, there was a time, back in the days of \\"Jurassic Park\\", when merely seeing this awe-inspiring CGI onscreen was enough to keep a moviegoer awake, but no more.  Nowadays, terrific CGI is so ubiquitous that it is easy to be blase about seeing it onscreen;  the CGI is just part of a movie's landscape, like the potted plants and furniture.<br /><br />Enough, my eyes and ears tell me, so what if the Kraken/Medusa/Giant Crab/Monster Du Jour is attacking - do I care enough about the characters and plot that it means anything?  Without that essential emotional connection to the story and characters, watching massive quantities of CGI is just as sleep inducing as watching potted plants grow.<br /><br />Sam Worthington is in this movie, which might be enough to keep his fans awake, but I am baffled at how he has managed to become a mega-movie star in such a short time.  A published critical review of his performance said that his CGI \\"Avatar\\" character had more facial expressions than he did in this movie.  Another said that his acting was so wooden that it belonged in the lumbar section of the Home Depot.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelsen was one of the few actors to squeeze a capable performance out of this movie, as Draco, the co-leader of Perseus's merry band of monster-chow.  Kudos to him for managing to retain his dignity, much more than Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes were able to do in this movie.  The presence of these two stars bring to mind the latter days of Sir Laurence Olivier, who was willing to appear in almost any bad movie as long as they paid his fee.  I would love to know just what was going through Liam Neeson's mind as he was walking around in that silly mirror-polished suit of armor and scraggly beard.  Come to think of it, he did once do both in \\"Excaliber\\"... so maybe that's what he was thinking.  Ralph Fiennes - has playing one of the most effective evil Nazis of all time onscreen (\\"Schindler's List\\") made him a lock for all the blockbuster Evil Bad Guy roles in Hollywood?  Take the money and run, is what seems to be going on here.<br /><br />One interesting visual effect of this movie was that all of the males were tanned a dark shade of bronze, whereas the two main female characters were left strikingly pale, which made me think that in the time of the Ancient Greeks,  men and women were of different races.  Or, perhaps the women were just locked up indoors all the time.  Both women were cute and did a decent job in their roles, but the shag rug carpet  which Io wore in her last scenes made me want to burst out laughing.  Poor Gemma Arterton.<br /><br />Yes, the costume designer for this movie was beyond horrible.  I could go on and on about the horrible costuming.<br /><br />Even worse, the Continuity Director must have been on drugs during the entire shoot.  Or maybe it was just really bad film editing, combined with a fractured screenplay.  Did anybody else notice the beautiful shot of sunlight breaking through the clouds....... during the total eclipse?  Right, it does get awfully dark during a total eclipse, and that entire Kraken vs. Argos scene (with Alexa Davalos getting strung up as Kraken food) should have been in the dark, or twilight.<br /><br />But then, almost nothing made sense in this movie.  The initial entry into the palace of the King of Argos - was it a festival or something?  What was with all the music and dancing girls?  Perseus and his group journey into Hades - Charon is mentioned, but barely seen - not enough left in the budget fora better Charon?  Then, having crossed the River Styx, they are not in Hades, but in Medusa's lair.  WTF?  And when Perseus comes out, he is seen exiting a cave.  What happened to recrossing the River Styx?<br /><br />More questions - Why is Pegasus black?  What happened to Calibos's hand? (an interesting teaser, watching his hand come back to life... and then nothing).  Why is it mentioned that Medusa can only turn men to stone, not women, and then the Kraken gets turned to stone when it sees the Medusa head? Does the Medusa head turn fish and crustaceans to stone also?  How about insects?  And oh dear me, WHY IS MEDUSA WEARING A BLACK BRA?  Imagine putting a bra on your pet snake, yes that's what that looked like.<br /><br />And of course, one cannot go through the list of what's totally bad in this movie without mentioning the obligatory Hollywood caricature of the Extremist Religionist, who is stuck into this movie like a sore thumb.  He appears as this skinny bare chested guy with mascara eyeliner shrieking in a British accent about offering up Andromeda as a sacrifice.  In between trying to stay awake, I could only groan and sigh \\"Not again\\" at the grating appearance of this character....<br /><br />There were lots of things like that which made me want to close my eyes during this movie...n Hades, but in Medusa's lair.

B0034GK7DM|5.0|What a fantastic debut CD when i heard his single A little more Country on the radio i thought it was King George<br />Strait,the resemblance is uncanny,he definitely is the new George Strait.It's great to hear one of the new singers<br />carry on the traditional values of George,George Jones,Keith Whitley,Alan Jackson.<br />I had to go buy the CD when i first knew who it was and i must say i love every song.Being raised in a family of 14 brothers and sisters in New Zealand who all sing and love country music the words in the songs standout.<br />Would recommend this for all country music lovers and i guarantee you won't be disappointed,Can't wait for a 2nd album.A must for George Strait fans.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|I liked it, but, having LOVED the original 1981 Harry Hamlin version, with creatures by Ray Harryhausen, this movie was a little disappointing.  It was good, but I expected more.  With that said up front, I could not wait to see this in the theater, and of course opted for 3D so the creatures  would stand out from the screen.  The Computer Graphic Imaging (CGI) and Animatronics were great!<br /><br />The story begins with a seaman opening a box on his ship that he salvaged from the sea  to find a living baby lying inside on its dead mother's chest.  He takes the baby boy home to raise as his own.  Young Perseus quickly advances to about age 25. As Perseus (Sam Worthington), his mother, father, and younger half-sister are on the ship approaching Argos, they see the huge statue of Zeus being thrown into the sea by the people.<br /><br />Now, let me side-step a minute.  Zeus (Liam Neeson) was the mythological god in charge of the humans. Zeus loved mankind, but mankind was getting a bit tired of honoring the gods all the time and still having to suffer and die.  Zeus also has an evil brother named Hades (Ralph Fiennes) who is in charge of the Underworld.  Calibos lives down there with Hades.<br /><br />Another side-step is that we find out that Perseus is a demigod (half god and half man).  Zeus came down one day, disguised as Calibos and made love to his queen, impregnating her with a son (Perseus).  King Calibos sealed his queen and the baby in a wooden coffin and they were thrown into the sea.  The baby lived, as we saw earlier, and Calibos went to the Underworld for his crimes.<br /><br />Back to the story--now the humans have upset their sponsor, Zeus. The sea begins to rise and Perseus' family all perish in the sea.  He is rescued and taken to Argos, where he meets Princess Andromeda and her family.<br /><br />Back on Mt. Olympus, the Council of gods are having a big meeting.  Hades is just dying to get at the humans with The Kraken, because Hades takes his strength from the people's fear, while Zeus takes his from their love.  Hades says, \\"Zeus, can I get after the people?\\"  and Zeus allows Hades to do his thing because the people have shunned the gods of Mt. Olympus.  So Hades appears in Argos, telling the King he has dishonored the gods.  Either sacrifice the princess to the Kraken in 10 days or Argos will be destroyed.  Perseus and the small army of Argos set off on a journey to find out how to kill the Kraken before the 10 days are up so he can save Andromeda.  Zeus sends his son a few special gifts now and then to help him on his journey, such as a special sword and a black-winged Pegasus.  On their journey, they meet giant scorpions, the jin people, and search for Medusa (whose very gaze turns any living creature into stone.)<br /><br />This is a neat movie to see in 3D and on the big screen.  It was filmed in Tenerife, UK, the Canary Islands, and Etheopia.<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend that you catch the 1981 version, whether you see this 2010 one or not.  If you want both, I recommend you see the 2010 one first.  Both stories follow the same script pretty closely but the 1981 version has a lot more to the story.  I also liked Sam Worthington in this type of action role.  I look forward to seeing him in future action movies.takes his from their love.

0061703257|5.0|Teddy is a US Marshal who has had a difficult life.  His father's death when he was a child, a horrific experience in WWII which included liberating the Dachau concentration camp, and his young wife's death in a fire have all left Teddy emotionally scarred.<br /><br />His current assignment brings him to Shutter Island, where there is a prison and treatment facility for the criminally insane.  They've had a patient mysteriously disappear, and Teddy and his new partner Chuck have been called in to discover her whereabouts.  Once they arrive, though, they realize that the missing patient is only one of many mysterious things about the hospital.  There is a carefully guarded building called a sewage treatment facility.  There are rumors about horrific drug tests and barbaric brain surgery.  Teddy starts to get the feeling that he might not make it back off the island.<br /><br />This book was excellent.  I loved the dialog among the characters and the way that Teddy's mind worked through all of the mystery surrounding the island.  I liked the way Teddy and Chuck's relationship formed as they grew more comfortable with each other.  I loved the way the author managed to set the tension for this story with the weather and the descriptions of the characters.  The book was really creepy and made me feel edgy without any battle scenes or blood and guts.  I found the ending of the story to be incredibly satisfying, tying up all of the loose ends hinted at throughout.

B0036XN2L2|3.0|...you don't really listen to it.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were a little too high for this (being their \\"final\\" album and all); I wish they were going out stronger.<br /><br />First, there are the lyrics. Other reviewers have pointed this out - but the lyrics generally border on ridiculous.  Thematically, this is much like KISS' Psycho Circus CD; it's often just a recognition of how far the Scorpions made it or how much they love to rock. And, sure - to be a Scorpions fan for any length of time, you can't really put too much weight on meaningful lyrics - but oftentimes the lyrics on Sting in the Tail are as awkward as they were 30 years ago. In that way, the Scorps have certainly recaptured something here....<br /><br />But I've been a fan of the band for about 20 years now, so I can look past lyrics most of the time. What I can't get past is that, musically, Sting in the Tail doesn't feel right. Maybe going through the writing process knowing this will be your last album has a way of creating magic in your mind that might not truly be there. Who knows - the whole album just feels kind of by-the-numbers. It may be closer to the style of Love at First Sting or Blackout than anything they've done since, but that could be because some tracks have guitar licks that feel copied from them (particularly \\"Raised on Rock\\"). \\"Slave Me\\" has a breakdown that too closely echoes the absurd \\"rap\\" portion of \\"Du Bist So Schmutzig\\" (off 1999's otherwise decent if lighter-than-usual Eye II Eye). The ballads here are mostly forgettable as well, especially the closer, \\"The Best Is Yet to Come\\".<br /><br />There are a couple bright spots for me - \\"Turn You On\\" and \\"Lorelei\\" - and, overall, this is a decent exercise in nicking the 80s style and creating some decent, if generic, rock. But, for a finale, and, especially after the brilliant [[ASIN:B000TSIK14 Humanity Hour 1]], I guess I was hoping for more.
B0036WHM1E|4.0|In 2007, Angus & Julia Stone released their debut record, A Book like This. With a focus on fairy tale themes and simplistic instrumentation, the album was a solid debut, but inevitably forgettable. Three years later, Angus and Julia have returned with a great deal of experience under their belts and what seems to be a lifetime of knowledge on the topics they were just beginning to understand in their debut.<br /><br />Trading vocals with her brother on every other song, Julia takes the lead track with \\"Hold On.\\" Her vocals are soft, airy and innocent sounding with similarities to Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O. With a lush string section reminiscent of Sia's \\"Breathe Me\\" building in the background, Angus & Julia have definitely expanded their instrumentation since their last release. The following track, \\"Black Crow,\\" gives Angus a chance to shine. With a likeness to Kings of Leon's \\"On Call,\\" \\"Black Crow\\" lays down a slow groove that remains unaltered throughout, but builds on a dynamic level that keeps the song interesting.<br /><br />Ringing in at 66 minutes long, the Stone siblings have given us a great deal of material to absorb. The weakness in the record occurs in the middle when creativity takes a backseat to genre experimentation and repetition. Tracks like \\"And the Boys\\" and \\"Walk It Off\\" have moments of beauty, but rapidly become lackluster. Ending with \\"The Devil's Tears,\\" however, is somewhat redeeming for those patient enough to play through the remainder of the thirteen total tracks on this release. Angus and Julia share a quiet duet that relates Down the Way to their first album while placing their maturation on display.<br /><br />Down the Way is a vast improvement from Angus & Julia Stone's first release. My guess is they will continue to grow and expand their instrumentation as the years progress. They have developed a great deal of buzz in Australia and in the U.K., but have yet to make their mark in the U.S. Perhaps this will be the album that gives them the break they deserve.<br /><br />Similar Artists: She & Him, Taken by Trees<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"For You\\"<br /><br />********ADDITION***********<br />Since my original review of this record, it has gradually become one of my favorite albums of the year.

B000PMFS2I|5.0|One precise word to describe the film could be 'Flamboyant'. a film emphasizing on a very rare subject, what we witness, is not just a journey of a woman on reaching success in life, but also a deep character study. Elizabeth Berkley as Nomi is simply excellent, she easily gives a stunning performance and steals the show. The character of 'Nomi' is full of self innocence, honesty, lust and boldness, one can't help but adore her as a woman. Some wonderful dances and music and neat character study makes this film worth a watch. Watch it like you are exploring deep inside 'Las Vegas' and much more than that.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I wasn't sure whether or not I would like this book, but the reviews were fantastic and I had been hearing about it from others so decided to check it out.  This is the kind of book I believe men and women, young or old, will all enjoy.  Some of the subject matter may be a little too mature for the younger audience but this book touches on so many important subjects.  The decision to write from the narrative of a dog was brave and creative and could have gone badly... but it just went perfectly.  You don't even need to be a fan of dogs to enjoy this book.  Highly recommended!

0385737947|2.0|Lately, I've been really into the YA dystopian books. I blindly picked up The Hunger Games last summer and loved it. I've since read Forest of Hands and Teeth, Birthmarked, Adoration of Jenna Fox, The Host, and a few others, all of which I enjoyed. I like stories that are not noticeably YA, except maybe for the absence of vulgarities and sex. It was very obvious to me that The Maze Runner was a YA book, which for some, may not matter. But for me, it lacked the depth and intricacies that make or breaks a story.<br /><br />I was absolutely excited for The Maze Runner after reading the Amazon reviews, but this is the very first time I've been so sorely disappointed when picking up a book due to other reviewers' enthusiasm. I had a hard time getting through The Maze Runner. There were a few times it interested me to keep reading, but for the most part I could only read it for a 1/2 hour at a time, when usually I could read for hours on end. Towards the middle I started skimming and reading dialogue to push myself through the bland writing.<br /><br />I wasn't emotionally invested in any of the characters, and had a really tough time picturing a lot of it, especially the grievers, which I blame on the writing. The new words to substitute for swears were annoying, and the characters very flat. I thought the ending was predictable and lackluster. This book might really work for some but I really, really didn't like it at all.
1401216676|5.0|Batman - The Killing Joke is one of the greatest Joker stories ever told by far not the singular one but one of the best.  Written by Alan Moore the most imaginative and best comic book writer ever. This story is no holds barred take on a truly insane criminal mind masterfully written and artistically designed by Brian Bolland a formidable artist. This is a dark tale of madness and obsession with the Joker one of Batmans oldest and deadliest adversaries.  Amongst other things this story stirred quite a bit of controversy bec ause the story involves the Joker brutally and pointlessly shooting the Commissioners daughter in the spine. Although this may seem shocking this does lead her to becoming a far more significant character in her new role as Oracle for Batman. The Joker is bent on dragging his nemesis into the insanity and hell that a series of bad events cast his own agonized soul into.  The story written by Alan Moore is so strong and powerful that it needs to be told.  The Killing Joke tells the origin of the Joker at least one of the origins. His origin is the underpinning for the psychological drama to unfold, true to his psychosis the Joker doesn't want to accept responsibility far from it he is bent on proving that any man put under duress can be insane.  This story and it,s elements within continue, in which it's not a story about the Joker as per usual but instead is a story on the examination of human nature, within which is on the Commissioner Gordon  wheather he can be turned into a raving luntaic or not by the clown prince of crime himself the joker!?The Killing Joke is a masterfully written story within the realm of psychological and sociological underbelly.  Each scene in the story is brimming with a perfect transition of writting between the present and past Bolland's art is unique in it,s unmatched appearance of work. Moore in is extraordinary manner of writing is trying to potray the  clown's smile the sad story of  a mass murderer a mad man brimming with insanity he is also trapped in a cycle he is also vulnerable and is also shown as a pathetic figure .  If you're a Joker fan this story is not to be missed it is the epitamy of what good story writing is about . This is a tale of the man who became the Joker , it has had a lasting impact on the DC Universe it has changed and redirected the characters and stories of the universe itself.

1416550550|3.0|I have to admit up front that I am only half-way through this book.  It has a fascinating premise and I will stick with it but.....each chapter jumps back and forth in time.  One chapter it is 1975, the next 1913, then 2005, then 1900.  This is not a book to put down and get back to in a day or so.  I fear you might forget who is speaking in that chapter's era.    Other than this little bump, I am enjoying the quest for the origin of the heroine of this book.  Wonderful writing style and descriptive sentences make you feel as if you are right there with the person of the chapter.  Enjoy and don't worry about my little quirk!

TAKE 2 !!!!!!.i sure dont remember any extras at the theather, so its not a big of deal for me. if the company its holding out on the extras, thats just business. theyre sure not putting a gun in my head and saying \\"buy the special ed\\"! im buying this and only edition the minute it comes out. for  those who want to wait, you all know deep inside your getting this edition.

B0035G9ABQ|4.0|from myBlog, check the link in my profile!<br /><br />...The only Electronic group with literally animated group members and consistently mind-blowing videos have released their third album last month. Talking about the Gorillaz naturally, who have made a name for themselves with great imagery, hotly discussed videos, and a handful of insanely catchy and iconic hit singles. With the groups first single from their new album \\"Plastic Beach\\", you get a real indication of what the album will be. The video for \\"Stylo\\" follows in their great tradition, and is yet another consistent and captivating music video co-starring Bruce Willis of all people. The song however, while good, is just a bit Too mellow and even guest appearances from Mos Def and R&B veteran Bobby Womack can't really make the song itself more memorable. And that's the main problem with the album, which is in general a good effort just not a very hard-hitting one. Not that the Gorillaz have ever been anything other than a mellow/chill Electronic group, however in their previous albums they did a great job at infusing some really catchy and more upbeat cuts into the mix. This album doesn't have a \\"Dirty Harry\\" or a \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" or even a \\"Dare\\" or \\"Clint Eastwood\\".<br />The good thing about the album is it's very cohesive and the \\"Plastic Beach\\" idea is felt in the vibe of the very relaxing tracks. And better still, the featured appearances from the likes of everyone from Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed and De La Soul mix in perfectly. There vocals never seem to take away from the moody and chill tone of the album. This album seems to be perfect if you are going to listen to the whole thing on maybe a road trip, or just some sort of a relaxing playlist for the beach or wherever. Not their best, but definitely not a bad album.
B001AQO3Z6|5.0|Perhaps if enough of us write reviews, Koyaanisqatsi in BluRay will become a reality.    The decision on whether or not to make a BluRay version of a given movie rests with the studio executives.  MGM in this case, I believe.  I hear that MGM is in financial difficulty.  K-Qatsi is a cult film and may therefore not be high on their priority list.  But any money they invest to remaster and release it on BluRay would probably produce a very fast and very large (percentage-wise) return on investment because just about everyone who owns the DVD version of this film is itching to buy the BluRay disc as soon as it comes out.  The same cannot be said for most films.    Studios often underestimate the profitability of niche-market products that have a small but dedicated fan base.  For example, the Fox TV Network had a science-fiction series about ten years ago called \\"Firefly\\" that developed an intense (albeit not huge) fan base.  The ratings weren't as high as Fox had hoped for, so the show got cancelled before the first season was finished.  Later, they released the series on DVD almost as an afterthought, probably not expecting to make much money on it.  As it turned out, everyone who'd been a fan of the show immediately bought the DVDs and Fox made a ton of money very fast, much to their surprise.  Consequently, Fox Studios decided to bankroll the theatrical film \\"Serenity\\" based on the series.  Perhaps not by coincidence, \\"Serenity\\" was one of the very first movies to come out on HD-DVD back when HD-DVD had a head-start over BluRay.    My own view of studio executives (both movie and TV) is that they're not exactly rocket scientists.

B001PO53IO|5.0|I am one of the few who actually liked the first clone wars movie so I didn't have any doubts about getting this one. I was expecting lower quality animation and no extra features because of the low price. I am very pleasantly surprised about everything. Starting with the casing itself it's one of those book type ones. I have a few others like it and I never really found them interesting. However, the concept art with notes on this one are very interesting and you get the feeling that the animators really cares about making a great show. The extra material mainly consists of a small behind the scenes  featurettes (around 7 minutes) for each episode with more concept art and some great insight from the creators. The episodes them self are top quality, I am constantly surprised of the level of detail on the characters and ships. Voice acting is excellent and the characters are likable. Only gripe is the battle droids that are a little too much slapstick and at times annoying. But that's for the kids i guess. If you have the chance get this on Blu Ray. It looks and sounds awesome and the price is very good.
0802130208|5.0|While the title of the review is borrowed from Miller's [[ASIN:0142437336 The Crucible (Penguin Classics)]], the metaphor works for this brilliant piece of literature as well.  Set in New Orleans, _A Confederacy of Dunces_ follows the misadventures of Ignatius J. Reilly, an over-educated young man who lives with his mother and seeks to avoid work at all costs.  The variety of situations he finds himself in, and the colorful cast of characters who cross his path (and who cross each-other's paths) make up the bulk of the plot.  This, however, does not do this magnificent, laugh-out-loud funny book justice.<br /><br />Ignatius is a modern-day Quixote, a man whose head is full of medieval literature and history, who sees himself as a 20th century Boethius, helplessly spun on the Wheel of Fortune.  He is lazy, obnoxious, compulsive and one of the most memorable, unique and truly humorous characters I have read.  With each misadventure, he adds to his \\"masterpiece\\", writing on Big Chief tablets the random accounting of his daily travails and rants about the modern world, certain he is a misunderstood genius.  Maybe he is.  With each job Ignatius finds (and subsequently loses), Toole introduces the reader to a new caste of characters, who in turn spin off on their own misadventures, often times crossing paths unnoticed with others whom we have been previously introduced.  The intricacy of the plot is similar to Tolstoy in its complexity.  Of course, I never laughed so hard reading Tolstoy as I did with _Confederacy of Dunces_.<br /><br />And this is how the wheel turns, each character's sub-plot in turn influencing the sub-plot of another and so on and so on, \\"wheels within wheels\\" - the writing and organization of the story and its sub-stories is mind-boggling.  What marks this as a particular piece of genius is how all the apparently loose ends are eventually tied together with the book's conclusion.  I have only one caveat: the book was given as a gift to read on the airplane as I made my first visit to New Orleans.  (What a wonderful city!)  Had I not been familiar with the location and haunts constantly referenced, I would have liked the book less, I think.  Having met some of the residents of New Orleans, I enjoyed the book even more - as more than a few were reminiscent of characters Ignatius meets.  Highly recommended.my first visit to New Orleans.

B000002GK1|3.0|This & Superunknown were some of the first albums I bought as a teenager. During my highschool years I was kind've a loner & depressed. Naturally I sought refuge in music (As most teenagers do.) This however- made me feel worst. OF all the bands I listened to growing up this is the only band I can say that about. I find their music to be very depressing *and seeing as how I was already depressed- that's really saying something!<br /><br />See, I tried listened to people that resonated with me. I've always been that way. Later I listened to Elliott Smith (which was awesome) but at this current stage in my life it was Soundgarden. Soundgarden & Nirvana. Well, I don't really have to tell you who won that battle now do I?<br /><br />See this music is boring, plain & simple. I don't understand what all the big hype is about. Now don't get me wrong- I still like Soundgarden- but I like them ONLY because I associate them with grunge. (Like so many other people do.) I like them for no other reason though. Their music doesn't move me. If anything it's boring. Let me give you a little background though. Like I said, these albums were amongst the first I purchased & I listened to them entirely. For the first 2 nights I listened to them completely. From start to finish. I don't know what I was looking for, but I didn't find it. Perhaps I was just looking for a song to like. And eventually I found them. (Outshined, Mind Riot, Holywater.) But after years of listening I can still say: I'm not impressed.<br /><br />These songs are good but they're not memorable. They're not songs that can easily define a mood or life-style. They're more like songs that come & go. You can listen to it on & off, but there's no love loss or gain for me. It's just TOO repetitive. Other than that the lyrics (for the most part) are incoherent or lack significant meaning. In one song Cornell is saying \\"The grass is always greener where the dogs are shedding\\" but it sounds like \\"where the dogs are sh!tting.\\" Personally I think the latter would have been greater, but no. He was saying shedding.. See even there you can't win.<br /><br />Well anyways, I bought this & SuperUnknown because of all the great reviews I read on Amazon. (Boy was that a mistake!)<br /><br />At that point I had made it a point (and still do) to check reviews before buying anything. I listened to the albums entirely for 2 nights straight. Not because I liked them, but because I was trying to. This just didn't do it for me. To this day I can't understand what all the big fuss was about. Someone actually had the nerve to say they were a mini-Led Zeppelin. (Ha!)<br /><br />Cornell's voice sounds the same on almost every track. He does this whiny thing with his voice & then talks in it. That's about it. It ranges from high to higher. That's it. The tracks- they sound like they depend entirely on loops. If you've listened to a track 1/4 way through you've heard it all (minus the solo.) Again, I'm not sure what all the big fuss was about. The singing is unimpressive, & so is the style. It's very...How do I say it.. Anti-life.<br /><br />Other words to describe it would be: Slow, sluggish, loud, &...Repetitive.<br /><br />When I think of grunge I think of Soundgarden, but they are NOT why I like it. Other bands do grunge SO much better. Bands like Fugazi, Morphine, Candlebox, Sponge, Silverchair, & Blind Melon, they ALL give grunge a good name.<br /><br />And what is grunge? Blues & rock. That's all it's ever been. Blues & rock with a hint of punk. And that's what soundgarden doesn't have. Soul! At least not enough to catch my interest..\\" Personally I think the latter would have been greater, but no. He was saying shedding..

B002SF9YUM|4.0|Fundamentally, this is a truly brilliant and artistic exploration of the life of Federico García Lorca, in which Salvador Dali played a major part. Lorca was unquestionably a pivotal figure in the Generation of 27, and Dali was perhaps THE pivotal figure in the surrealist movement that alternately worshiped and shunned him. However, do NOT accept the hype of this work as \\"The Gay Dali Movie.\\" This is the tragic and compelling tale of man who changed his world - Lorca, not Dali - a revolutionary, a poet, a visionary, a playwright, a genius, and a gay man in an culture where all of the above came to be despised.     This movie does him justice, and depicts his contemporaries (including the brilliant and increasingly mad Dali) in accurate, penetrating and often unflattering detail. It is a must-watch for those interested in the rise of fascism, the worlds of art and poetry, the culture of Spain or the artistic and cultural revolutions of the early twentieth century. If you're looking for a great gay period piece, go for Brokeback Mountain or Brideshead Revisited; if you're looking for a brilliant, sensitive and artistic work that happens to be gay, THIS is your movie.

B000002LRX|5.0|In a perfect world, this record would have outsold \\"Thriller\\" one-hundred fold [I'm not taking a cheap shot at Michael Jackson, just an opinion :)] This is one of those rare pieces of art in ANY medium where, IMHO, the abundance of adulation holds water. So much is explored here, so many images and emotions are evoked throughout. So much more is constantly revealed after each listen. And it's NEVER boring or tedious. Each track is worth it's weight in diamonds, but my favorites would have to be: \\"Land Of Sunshine\\", which is like a funk-tinged three ring circus from hell, \\"Midlife Crisis\\", possibly the catchiest tune in existence, \\"RV\\", the ramblings of a trailer park invalid set to a satirical waltz and \\"Jizzlobber\\", an ominous metal anthem with some truly psychotic vocals. If you're a die-hard fan of alternative music, chances are you already own this. But if you don't, you'd be hard pressed to make a more worthwhile purchase. Oh, and one last thing. Do NOT be scared off by the fact that nearly every \\"nu-metal\\" outlet has raked in millions of dollars by taking the formula for this record, dumbing it down considerably and stripping it of it's artistic merit. This is quite different from odious trash like Limp Bizkit and Insane Clown Posse. Thank you and have a nice day.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I say love/hate relationship, because Jillian kicks my ass every morning during the video and I \\"hate\\" her for it. But I love the results! I'm currently trying to lose some weight before my wedding this summer and before purchasing this DVD set, I had been spending 45 minutes jogging on the treadmill every morning for 3 months with very frustrating results. I am very happy to report that I lost more weight and inches in 3 weeks of training with Jillian for just 25 minutes every morning than I did in 3 months on the treadmill. Now I tell everyone I meet that they need to give this DVD set a try.     I personally rotate through level 1 and 2 and throw in one of Jillian's other Biggest Loser workouts in place of level 3. (I find that level 3 is too hard on my knees.)
0792844882|5.0|I love this film so much. From the very first day that it was released in theatres, I was on it. I love dancing, I love Vegas Showgirls and I love sexy women who have no problem showing their power. This film has all of that and more. It is so easy to get lost in and sucked into. Just turn off your mind, relax, and float downstream. Its dazzling Showgirl production numbers, along with its over the top storytelling and very sexy star, Elizabeth Berkeley (in a very underrated role she gave her all to) will have you mesmurized throughout the film, if you just let the elements take you. Also, don't underscore the music, which does a great job of pulling you into the film further. All of the elements in this well-made production were very thought out and meticulously edited and presented here for maximum enjoyment value. Pure escapist joy of a film. Don't let the naysayers disway you. They are just embarrassed by the more taboo subject matter. Just relax, turn up the 5.1 and go for a fun thrilled ride!!!<br /><br />I have just one question: On Amazon, the regular DVD says the running time is 128 minutes and so does the VIP version. But the Fully Exposed Edition says 131 minutes, yet other reviewers say there is no difference in any of the DVD presentations other than extra features. I wonder if that is the case.<br /><br />Anyway, get this film. If you love movie escapism, and after all isn't that what movies are about, this movie will not disappoint you. Just have an open mind and enjoy it for what it is, a fun, thrilling, sexy, musical joy ride!!!<br /><br />I am a professional writer and publisher: [[ASIN:0963549936 S.O.S. ~ Songs Of Sobriety ~ A Personal Journey Of Recovery]]
B002VECLVO|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this movie. I've seen it twice at the theater. I will be purchasing the DVD. Colin Firth should have won an Oscar for this performance. (sorry Jeff Bridges...loved you too but Colin's understated pain and loss which he acted so subtly through minor facial expressions is just amazing)    Tom Ford should have been nominated for best director and this film should have been nominated for best movie. And should have won both. I can't wait to see what Tom Ford does next. Although, I can't imagine how he could top this first time out. Some have said it's too artsy....not at all. All of the artsy-ness of it makes sense. This is a gorgeous film. The music is amazing. I bought the soundtrack immediately after seeing it. I cannot get this movie out of my mind. Anyone who has experienced great loss will identify with George (Colin's character).    I cried and cried in this movie the first time and the second time I cried even earlier on because I knew what was coming up. The scene with the dog in a parking lot takes my breath away...how beautifully perfect it is. I've never been so touched by a film. The way Colin(George) smells the dog....oh it breaks your heart in a million pieces.    Tom Ford is a genius. Please, Tom if you ever read this...make more movies!!!!! You are so incredibly talented.
0385736002|3.0|I was at first a little daunted by the size of this book, so I put it aside for awhile until most of my students had finished the whole series and I was left behind. When I started to read (and listen) to this book, I was not immediately intrigued. It was very slow to catch my attention and I'm still not particularly sure that I care about the characters. Here is a brief summary of the story:    Nicholas Flamel and his wife are immortal because Nicholas unknowingly purchased The Codex from someone early in his life (over 500 years before the story begins). The Codex describes many secrets from the elder race, including prophecies and alchemical recipes. Anyways, the elders want this book so that they can take over the world. They have commissioned Dr. John Dee to get the book from Nicholas. So, on a summer afternoon, Dee goes after Flamel in Flamel's bookstore. Josh, a clerk from the bookstore, and his twin sister Sophie, attempt to help Nicholas and his wife from the seemingly mad man that is trying to steal and kill them. No good act goes unpunished, so Sophie and Josh get caught up in this mess. Dee ends up with most of the book and Flamel's wife. However, Sophie and Josh could be a set of twins that are prophesied about in the Codex. The battles begin as Flamel tries to train and protect the twins, while also trying to get the book back from Dee. Flamel enlists the help of some of the good(ish) elders and destruction flows through the rest of the book. Are the twins really magical? Is the prophecy correct? How many people can actually survive their exploits? Now, you have to read it and find out.    As I mentioned, I was not really into the book. The action was intriguing. There was a lot of movement and the book never really slowed down, but I never fell in love with the characters. I don't believe that Scott made them overly interesting. The elders are described in more depth than the twins, and the twins are really the focus of the book. It made it hard for me to buy into the book when I didn't care one way or the other if the main characters made it through. Also, there is a bit of conflict within Josh that I think could have been explored further. It may have made me want to read the next one more. I will say that the best part of this book is the mixing of mythology. The elders are all basically gods from ancient times. They are intriguing and the back stories that are slipped in here and there are fun to examine.    My student's have all enjoyed this book, so it is not a total loss for me. I believe that the constant adventure pulls a reader through regardless if they feel the same about the characters as I do. The magical fighting is creative and described very well. I think my favorite part comes towards the end after a major magical battle. Scott includes a quote from the local newspaper from that town and explains the attacks. It just made me laugh to see how the truth is changed in media even in fiction. This book is best suited for children ages 11 (if they are a strong reader) to 16.

0618918248|2.0|The author offers a general critique of religion, especially the familiar Abrahamic faiths. He concludes that the religious view is clearly invalid and that a god involved in human affairs is too improbable to merit serious consideration.  Although I personally find the supernatural claims of such religions unconvincing, and regard the possibility that there is no god as conceivable, I often found the approach of this book and its arguments somewhat tedious and superficial.<br /><br />I will admit that the author was amusing at times, and his discussion of the Templeton Foundation, of which of I was previously unaware, was somewhat enlightening.  His observation that the Templeton Foundation bestows a prize of greater monetary value than the Nobel Prize for spiritual achievements is interesting.  His claim that the prize seems like a sort of bribe to induce scientists \\"to say something nice about religion\\" is worth looking into.<br /><br />Dawkins also touches upon the intellectual laziness of creationism.  Indeed, people who give up on finding an evolutionary path to a given living entity, such as Behe at Lehigh, are not doing anybody a favor!  Perhaps some people are unaware of the connection between science and engineering--or medicine.  When the scientist understands how a living structure has developed by physio-chemical processes, the engineer or physician can then use that understanding to cure or prevent a disease.<br /><br />The most objectionable flaw of this book is similar to that of books written by evangelical Christians--that of a rush to judgment.  The forth chapter of this book is devoted to proving that god does not exist.  All that he offers in way of an argument is a series of metaphysical conjectures.  He attempts to disprove the anthropic principle by claiming that the existence of parallel universes renders the need for one fine-turned universe unnecessary.  The existence of parallel universes, however, is little more than a conjecture, as are many other ideas current in Physics.  Some day one of these conjectures may indeed break away from the pack, predict the masses of fundamental particles, and derive the value of Planck's constant and other important parameters.  This day, however, has not yet arrived.  Until such an event comes to pass, I don't believe that we can begin to narrow down the possibility of whether god does or does not exist.  Until then, those of us who conduct and analyze scientific experiments on daily basis find that our best theories are unable to predict even the simple motions of atoms on a surface, let alone a comprehensive theory of everything that might trace the evolution of God during the early stages of the Big Bang.<br /><br />There are other questions or points of view that the author dispenses with in a manner that is too cavalier.  He interprets the concerns of a rabbi for undermining the religious faith of others as intellectual cowardice.  I really think that such is an unfair characterization!  He also dismisses the miracle at Fatima without any real explanation other than that the sun really could not have fallen from the sky.  Although the sun clearly did not fall from the sky, it is also clear that something strange happened there--something for which we less formally religious people have no adequate explanation.<br /><br />There are good books that have been written on the topic of what is knowable, and, by implication, what can be said about god and his role in the world.  On the side of the believers, the book by Collins (the leader of the Human Genome Project) is a pleasure to read and offers a religious view that is in accord with evolutionary biology.  On the other side Karl Popper lays out a worldview that makes no mention of religion as a source of authority.<br /><br />I am not sure who would actually benefit from this book.  For people who could not understand the validity of evolution after studying it in high school, the odds are against them ever learning to appreciate it.  People who have a proper understanding of evolution, and therefore regard it favorably, would not actually glean a great deal from this book.  People who believe that evolution is impossible and contrary to their religion will probably never be convinced by any argument; as a result this book would offend them instead of winning them over.ave a proper understanding of evolution, and therefore regard it favorably, would not actually glean a great deal from this book.

B000002A46|3.0|I recenrtly \\"inherited\\" a bunch of holiday CDs and discovered something interesting.  Listening to Christmas music all winter long can help keep the blahs away and the homefires glowing.  Of course, when you still grinning like an idiot on Groundhog's Day and wishing people \\"Season's Greetings\\" (hey groundhogs have seasons too), people tend to take their winter doldrums out on YOU.  So be careful out there.    So anyway, what to think of this Mariah holiday effort?  Not bad.  I don't listen to Mariah all that much.  She can indeed be over the top, as her critics maintain.  On the other hand, she's got talent (sort of like Britain and America), and I do find that dismissing singers out of hand because you don't like their style can come back and haunt you if they just change their style a tad, but enough so that you start to like them in spite of yourself.  It happened to me with Pat Benatar, when one day I found myself humming \\"We Belong\\" and some of those other mid-80s numbers.    It's pretty inevitable that if you can pull all the vocal tricks that Mariah can (or could), you're gonna use 'em.  I can't fault her for showing off from time to time--or even most of the time.  Still I have to agree with those who maintain that she goes from gospel stuff to what appears to be outtakes from THE LOST PHIL SPECTOR CHRISTMAS ALBUM.  I like the gospel stuff.
015603252X|4.0|A brilliantly written autobiography, A Tale of Love and Darkness is sometimes gorgeously descriptive, witty, with beautifully rounded and developed characters. At times, however, it's a hard slog.   It's amazing how Oz somehow managed to know and interact with so many of the fathers and mothers of the State of Israel. The history alone makes this a powerful read.
1439138311|2.0|Colm Toibin's Brooklyn tells the story of Eilis, a young woman who escapes a provincial 1950s Irish upbringing and matures in a Brooklyn rooming house.  Having grown up during the 50s a half mile from Ebbet's Field, shopping in the Fulton Street area, and attending Brooklyn College, I enjoyed the nostalgic walk around the block.  Oddly, the novel felt 100-200 years older than the 50s, almost a manners tale, not Austen or Dickens in quality of character or plot, but somehow reaching for a little of each. Sensible expectations.  The novel ambles along as if World War II never happened, with an ocean crossing depiction reminiscent of turn of the previous century nightmares followed by surprisingly little observation of the post-war Brooklyn environment.  It is tempting to say that the novel would have made a better short story, or a better longer novel, but my disappointment is probably not related to the length, but to the lack of theme and focus in the narrative. There are no subplots, and fundamentally Eilis' story seems more suitable to 1st person narration.  Was the story about breaking away from confining family or place, immigration, evolving realizations, obeying/breaking the rules, betrayal, achieving aspirations, first love, sexual awakening, cultural/religious differences?  All of the above, and unfortunately, none of the above.

B00005RIKI|5.0|On PRONOUNCED LEHN'-NERD SKIN'-NERD', Lynyrd Skynyrd break out of the gate with a bang. The song \\"Simple Man\\" tells us to stick to our roots; \\"Gimme Three Steps\\" describes a guy narrowly escaping a fight with his life; \\"Poison Whiskey\\" warns of the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption; and \\"Free Bird\\" and \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" speak on the surface of leaving a lover, but deep down really one's whole life, behind. Those two songs have inspired me to skip food-related reunions at my old school. Overall, this is one of the most important Southern rock records ever, along with Skynyrd's own SECOND HELPING, STREET SURVIVORS, and ONE MORE FROM THE ROAD, the Allman Brothers Band's AT FILLMORE EAST, EAT A PEACH, and BROTHERS AND SISTERS, and the Outlaws' first three albums, BEST OF THE OUTLAWS: GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES, and BRING IT BACK ALIVE.

My most favorite tracks on this album are Music, Runaway Lover, Nobody's Perfect, Don't Tell Me, What It Feels Like For A Girl (mostly the remixes), Paradise (Not For Me), and Gone.
B002VECM6S|2.0|This story had all the elements of a fine sports story cliche - rich vs. poor, black vs. white, etc etc... Has anyone heard of Radio, Rudy, etc etc....In this age of bad-movie making, poor directors, the lowest common denominator, is it any surprise that this movie got so many raves.  This had too much syrup and too little reality.  And what did Sandra Bullock do to earn an Oscar?  Not sure.  Didn't seem like such a tough part, except how humorous was it to see her in the hood with that skimpy dress.  Real believable.      And the little brother was annoyingly cute.

B0034JKZ86|4.0|I was highly anticipating this movie, but I was disappointed to a degree. I felt this movie didn't have the same magic, for the lack of a better word, compared to the other Disney movies featuring princesses. Maybe because I'm a little older than I was when I saw the other movies or maybe because this particular fairy tale occured outside of \\"once upon a time,\\" and somewhere in a far away land.     However, that doesn't mean the movie was horrible, it was enjoyable, sweet, and did make me teary. It's refreshing seeing Tiana head out to try and make her dream come true. Her trials getting there are realistic. At first, I didn't know what to make of Prince Naveen, but he grew on me. Tiana and Prince Naveen are cute and funny together - brillant chemistry. I've got a soft spot for \\"aruging like a married couple,\\" sort of thing and I enjoyed the fact that not only did Tiana speak her mind, but that these two learned a thing or two from one another. Tiana's friend Charlotte is hilarious, a bit of hopeless romantic (but then, so am I), and her antics when it comes to love just makes me laugh (she's adorable).     This movie is worth the watch with beautiful animation and music. This is the Disney that I like, taking us all back to the good ole days of Little Mermaid right up to Snow White. I'm looking forward to the next installment of Disney's remakes on fairy tales.

B002RAREAK|3.0|I love Usher, so of course I got his new album. I wasn't impressed though. It's not like confessions, but it's better than Here I Stand. The songs are cool but there are some that he should have left off because they just didn't fit him at all. Those songs would be: Lil Freak, I hate Minaj so this was an automatic skip when I found out she was on it. The second would be OMG with Will I Am, no words to describe how bad this song is, another skip. The song with Ludacris is okay, but I only like Luda's part. The music is terrible, and really superhero music? How old is he again? That's what I thought. All in all the album is cool, nice beats, lyrics, favorite song is Guilty with T.I, amazing, that's my favorite song on the album. So I give it a 3 out of five. He lost major points by putting that joke you call a rapper Minaj on his album. UGH.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I loved it. Still do. My favourite movie of all time and ultimately the one that introduced me at a tender age, to the world of SCI-FI and Fantasy.  When I saw the movie the first time, I could not take my eyes off it and had sneaked to the TV set to indulge in a late night movie without my parent consent.  It had been very late and I had gotten sleepy but when this movie DUNE started I forgot about the sand man and focused my whole being to watching....    Never have forgotten it and any other followup DUNES could, sadly, never compare.    I am very happy to see it has been converted to BLU-RAY.

Everyone who goes in search of doing good shall always be blessed in the heart and spirit and that is why this movie has been so popular; I am simply lamenting the overlay of fakeness in which it was presented; the reality seems so far from what I have glimpsed; so hopefully, after that, this will cover at least a bit of something. An explane' if you will.<br /><br />Sometimes the only sense of happiness comes in split rotation forms of music and movies; snippets of greatness fed piecemeal into my psyche; little pieces of warmth or rather fits of cold fusion that wraps my warped and weary soul with a molecular coat of sustenance patting down the hairs of my soul and petting me into a comatose slack jawed sense of familiarity letting me know that at least in some corners of the universe I am not completely and entirely alone; I am not the only one who looks around and says, What the **** has happened here? - - and then the realization that there is no solution.<br /><br />I made the tragic mistake of thinking there might be some piece of this comfort resting within the confines of this movie, excuse me, commercial. And in making this mistake I seem to have mistakenly given over a part of myself to trying to make sense in what America seems to hold up to the light and applaud. Not only applaud but gather around, hold up as of mortals worshipping Gods; and I must freely admit that this idea of heralding such blatant materialism and juvenile quest to the finish line touch downs yellow flags and all; quite simply makes me ill. Not ill as in I fear there is a chill in the room and I may sense a fever coming on. Ill in the sense that I look around and see so much fake and plastic being passed off as real; ill in the sense that this very movie is such a great lie. The only real part of it being the essay written by Mike, entitled, \\"white walls.\\" A moment of clarity interrupts the fake and plastic and inserts itself for a few scarce moments.<br /><br />Compare this commercial to something like say, \\"Doubt,\\" \\"Precious,\\" or \\"The Hurt Locker,\\" and where does it stand? Way over in the corner looking out the window and hoping that mum is on the way to the circular drive and wondering what's for dinner. Because the reality is that this is a joke. It is a sick sinister joke. Turning the ever well oiled wheels of the illusion that if you run fast and hit hard and throw the ball just right then the contract and the endorsements are just abatements holding the line until you maybe or maybe not quite graduate from high school and run out into the open arms of the fake and the plastic; but the cheering crowds will reward the players all the same; this is Rome, after all.<br /><br />So, go on and get yer game on. Go on and slap some ass and work on flattening out that southern drawl until it sounds as monotone and as void of any feeling as the very mouth it is coming out from. Spew. Spew. Spew. Spew the monochrome into the ominous void and - touch down, we have a winner. Sadly, there are so many schools containing teaching lounges just like this one, and sadly, it will never change. Just watch the teacher who holds up an essay like, \\"white walls,\\" and then take a step back and back and back and walk right out the door because that's exactly where the job will take you. Was there a mission statement written into the dialogue around here somewhere? And how dare I pare down and split open something so juicy as a watching a barbie doll try to push herself into a reality that she will never understand? What's wrong with me and why don't I just get with the program? - - Come on already.<br /><br />I think I'll opt out of the plan. And I'd suggest to parents who want their children to grow up not as products, but as real people who think real thoughts, to abstain and go in search of a good book. Or maybe write an essay on the violent nature of football and it's ever enforced violent nature of the crowds and the illness that takes over and inserts itself into people's psyches; write an essay examining why it's okay for someone who looks great in color coordinated outfits to cut in front of the line and sass talk the workers; just because it looks good. I think of the movie, \\"Precious,\\" and the reassurance that there are real writers out there - Sapphire - who dare to write the truth and then someone comes along and makes it into a movie; these are the moments my soul climbs into in order to breathe, in order to go up and on and face the great American void; in order to be able to write the truth about this movie which is in no uncertain terms; pushing the lie.ush herself into a reality that she will never understand?

0307266303|5.0|Even if you are not a runner, this is an excellent read.  It's been a long time since I've read a non-fiction book that kept me glued to the pages (if you liked Seabiscuit, then you will love reading this book).  It takes you through some great details of distance running history and McDougall's storytelling ability keeps you wanting to read more and more.  A fun, but factual book that enlightened me.  I considered myself a \\"knowledgeable\\" runner and this book opened my eyes to what else is out there in the running world.  It gives one a very unique perspective on the spiritual connection humans have with long distance running.  I highly recommend this book.  You won't be diappointed!
B00275EGWY|1.0|This movie is boring.  I love war movies but I could not wait for this movie to end.  Don't waste your time with this one!
B000TGQDZQ|3.0|This band could be SO awesome if they wanted to, easily ranking up there with Nightwish and the likes. WHY then do they insist on keeping their Uruk-Hai singing? When Simone is at the microphone the song is about a 6 out of 5. Enter Mr Orc and the score drops to about a negative 3. GET RID OF HIS SINGING PLEASE!!!!!! He's great on the guitar, keep him there!
B002VECMAO|1.0|this movie is really bad, wish I didn't waste my time on it. Not recommended, sorry
0061537969|5.0|I read this book for a monthly book club selection.  It had all of the elements of a great read..  human interest, family trials and tribulations, mystery and humor.  I also liked the fact that it introduced me to a field that I had no knowledge of and that I grew to undertstand somewhat (race car driving) And then there was Enzo.. never have I met a more appealing protagonist.  I bought this book after reading it to give as a gift, since I had originally borrowed it.
B0036EBARO|5.0|I will keep this simple.  If you loved the infectious, uptempo songs of \\"Supernature\\", but were disappointed with \\"Seventh Tree\\", then you will love this album.  I have listened to it three times now, and play it from beginning to end, skipping nothing.  Super album!
B000000OQF|5.0|This album was what started my love for all that is hair metal, power metal, hard rock, melodic rock, etc. etc. Based on that alone, I have to give it five stars. I remember listening to this on cassette tape over and over while delivering newspapers during my early teen years. I have a collection of nearly 1000 CDs but I don't often go back to this one because I have heard the songs so much and have become bored with them over time. In fact, I prefer some of the more mature material from the Use Your Illusion era better than these songs. However, I can't dispute this as a five star album. Anyone that says otherwise either doesn't like the genre of this music or has a personal issue with the band itself.
0965316599|4.0|It's unfortunate that the 1-star negative review got triple posted, messing with the rating of this book because this is a great little book.  This book is an incredibly fun read and does not take itself too seriously.  If you want to read a book about the English language, and you don't want one that is too scholarly, this is it.<br /><br />There are plenty of really scholarly works out there - and many of them are pretty much unreadable.  And in fact, one of the things this book points out repeatedly is how various theories come in and out of fashion.  In linguistics, it seems a lot of the oral history of our words are based off of ideas that are kinda hard to prove.  I have no doubt there are mistakes in the book some of which the angry reviewer has noted, but I believe that Mr. Bryson has most likely tried to be as accurate at possible.<br /><br />Instead of trying to write a definitive work, I think Bill Bryson set out to write a mirror for us to have a laugh at ourselves and our wonderful language.  He's not a linguist - but he's not a hack either.  He is exploring this language and seeing how it stands in this world - among other languages and in its point in history (1989) relative to its lengthy past.  And his exploration is extremely well written even if maybe there are mistakes here and there.<br /><br />I find the book a great read.  If you're gonna write a dissertation or looking for a definitive work (or a book that takes Esperanto seriously), this isn't it.  But if you want to have an enjoyable read chuckling at our idiosyncrasies and learning a little bit more at how we got here, I think you'll have a great time!
B0036XN2L2|5.0|When I first heard this album, I was thoroughly impressed and thought there was not a bad song on the disc. I began to wonder if the Scorpions had just put out the best album of their long storied career, thus saving the best for last. I have since backed off of that opinion after going back through my Scorpions collection to listen to their other material again. However, I do have to contend that this album definitely deserves consideration for inclusion in their top five if not top three albums the Scorpions have ever made. There really are no bad songs on here. After several listens all the way through, I have found one or two that I don't like as much as the others, but I would not consider them any type of filler song. The thing that stands out the most on this album is the quality of the ballads. The Scorpions have almost always had ballads on their albums. This one is no exception, but they have not been THIS GOOD since the days of Holiday, Still Loving You, and Wind of Change. Yes, they are that good. There are three pure ballads on this disc. They are Sly, Lorelei, and The Best is Yet to Come. The Good Die Young may also be considered a ballad but it has a lot more power to it in the vein of No One Like You. If you look at these ballads, they all seem to incorporate some of the best traits of some of their classic ballads of the past and they are full of emotion, passion and melody to the point you will be singing them in your head for days on end. The 30 second samples of the ballads included on Amazon really don't do the full songs justice. The samples don't display the really nice guitar driven melodies and solos within the songs.    As for the harder edged songs, there are some great tracks such as Raised on Rock, Sting in the Tail, and Spirit of Rock. The other songs are all good in their own way, but those three are my favorites. Also, I can't help becoming a bit melancholy as I listen to the last track, The Best is yet to Come and think about how this great rock band that I grew up on is now calling it quits after this album and tour. All told, I think the strength of the ballads and the lack of any truly weak songs makes this last offering by the Scorpions one of their best of all time.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I admit that when I went to see this in the theater I was very unsure if I would enjoy the movie but I was happily suprised at how much I enjoyed the movie.  Robert Downey Jr. was simply brilliant as Holmes with the right blend of humor and seriousness.  He conveyed the excentric nature of Holmes while showing his brilliance.  Jude Law was very good at playing a Watson that was Holmes' equal rather than a simply side kick.  Rachel McAdams was a delight as Irene Adler, the only person besides Moriarity, to get the better of Holmes.  The movie had the right blend of action, adventure, comedy, and drama and the inevitable sequal is already in the works.  The advantage is that this film has created a wonderful base from which to build on and foreshadowed Holmes struggle with Moriarity.
B001KVZ6F2|2.0|Oh, boy, was this movie offensive.<br /><br />I'm not even talking about the rampant Archie Bunker-esque racist remarks coming from the mouth of angry old Mr. Kowalski, either. I'm talking about the fact that this was yet another movie in a long line of movies in which the non-white characters bumble through their lives as utter childlike idiots with no clue how to live, until a white man comes along and sets them straight.<br /><br />The fact that it was up to this man to teach Thao (whose name Mr. Kowalski wouldn't even pronounce correctly, and everyone was fine with that, including Thao and his family) how to be a \\"MAN\\" really angered me. Did Thao just step out of a big white balloon? Does he have no other adults influencing his life? We know that his father is dead, but I distinctly saw other males in his house during the ceremony at the beginning. That's implying that there is, in fact, only one way to be a man, and that way is to be abrasive, assertive with women, use tools, and be quick with the ethnic slurs and the profanity. Wow. Just wow.<br /><br />Speaking of the ethnic slurs, why are they okay? Why does no one call him on them? Sue even jokes with him about how her family doesn't eat dogs, only cats. Why does she do that? Why are they seen as something almost noble, an art form?<br /><br />Thao also talks about how he couldn't get a job. Why not? It's not explored. It seems to me that it's not explored because it's not seen as important. We see that Thao is quiet, meek, and likes to garden, but we don't see anything else. He is not really a character in the movie, rather a means to an end. He's just there so he can be saved, transformed, and so Mr. Kowalski can be redeemed through him.<br /><br />His sister Sue fares little better. She has more to do, but it's abundantly clear through the movie that since she is just a girl, she too will need to be saved, or avenged. It's just ridiculous. She starts out as a strong character, but ends up as just a victim. The gang member cousins dismiss her as just a woman, and so does the film.<br /><br />Indeed, the only character with any development is Mr. Kowalski. Yes, Thao supposedly became a \\"man\\", but I didn't see much difference in how he behaved throughout the movie.<br /><br />It could have been really good, and parts of it are very entertaining and funny. The part where Walt is in the Hmong family's basement, has no idea what to do, and ends up fixing their washing machine, only to have no one notice, was hilarious. I think the depiction of the ungrateful family who wants Walt's house and car were very well-done and realistic. And I admit, it is a pretty good redemption story at least in theory, but I keep forgetting it takes place in 2008 because the ideals are so dated. I honestly have seen episodes of \\"Jonny Quest\\" that are less blatantly racist, and that's a cartoon from the 60s.her as just a woman, and so does the film.

B001VLXNLU|5.0|This book is my favorite book. Even better than Twilight. Zoey was just like a regular teen getting caught up with boyfriend issues even though she had to fight evil spirits. It had everyhing I enjoy in a book. It is seriously something you should read and in my opinion is the best book in the series. I couldn't put it down! The best book ever!
B001OQCV2E|4.0|Ensconced somewhere, Roland Emmerich is cackling and wringing his hands, awaiting doomsday. In some hidden underground lair of his, the man has probably constructed the ultimate bomb shelter or at the very least is assembling his own Noah's ark. He may even be working off Irwin Allen's blueprints. This is how I like to think the mind of Roland Emmerich works. 2012 is the latest from this master of disaster and it's his biggest try yet. Emmerich has stated that 2012 would be his final disaster picture and if it is, this one is gonna be hard to top.<br /><br />The best-laid schemes of mice and man again get diddled. A long time ago the Mayan calendar predicted the end of the world. It's 2012 now, and the signs are there. An alignment of planets, a phenomenon which happens only every 640,000 years, is causing massive solar flares to boil up the earth's core. Temperatures are rising, the earth's crust is destabilizing. In California, more now than ever, tremors have become a habit. Crazies crowd the street corner, waving their crayoned cardboard signs, heralding the Apocalypse. Back in 2009, the imminent global calamity is discovered and a massive, unprecedented, and very top secret international endeavor is launched.<br /><br />In 2012 struggling author and divorced deadbeat dad Jackson Curtis (Cusack) gets the gift of being in the right place at the right time. On a camping trip with his children, he unearths a conspiracy and gets a whiff of how he can save himself and his loved ones. More involved in the secret project to preserve humanity is the geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and as the end of the world looms closer, Adrian finds his idealism trumped by the horrible realities of life. Although, the story follows a diverse cast, Curtis and Helmsley are the core characters.<br /><br />Word to the wise: If you're making a disaster epic, make sure the special effects pop out and the cast is solid, because the f/x will have to carry the day but it has to be anchored by characters that you'll care enough about. I heard the budget ran around the 200 million mark so the CG stuff is truly rendered on an overwhelming scale. And while their character arcs aren't so original, Cusack's everyman appeal, Ejiofor's sincerity, Oliver Platt's smug Chief of Staff - and, by the way, Platt and Ejiofor engage in some pretty incendiary scene-chewing -  Woody Harrelson's terrific looney tunes doomsaying DJ, and Zlatko Buric's Russian billionaire... these cats are glue enough to keep you emotionally invested. Also, that seven-year-old girl with the pull-ups and the hat fixation is adorable. 2012 covers the usual bases of the genre: fractured families, a soap opera, a morality play, the end of the world.<br /><br />Scoff or cave in. You'll have to do one or the other. There are only so many scenes of hairbreadth escapes, of our cast outrunning earthquakes and crushing waves of water, fireballs and other hurtling objects that you can take in before you either get enough of the nonsense or submit to Emmerich's fantastical whims. Me, I rolled with all the crazy stuff and the cheesy stuff. What is 2012 if you can't suspend disbelief? Although, at an elephantine running time of 2 hours and 38 minutes, that's a lot of suspension.<br /><br />I can see audiences in other countries checking this film out if only to see how the toppling of their famous landmarks are handled. The CG is bombastic and absolutely stunning and treats us to a breathtaking film-long chain of mammoth scenes in which monuments and landscapes are absolutely obliterated. The destructive sh-- that goes down is exactly what big screens are made for. 2012 is a spectacle and, really, there's nowhere else for Emmerich to go if he were to make another disaster film. There are no more kitchen sinks.<br /><br />In the Grain of Salt Department, I have a few nitpicks about Cusack's character, and these are really the only concerns which took me out of the movie. The first is at the Yellowstone National Park where Jackson Curtis disregards the warning signs posted on a fence and opts to scale the fence with his children, even with one of the kids remarking dubiously: \\"Don't you see the signs?\\" The other is an even more blatant case of reckless endangerment as Jackson takes his young daughter along on a whirlwind search for the crazy DJ, Charlie Frost. The last thing is actually Jackson being a good dad and it happens near the end. Time very much a factor and tapped with playing hero, Jackson got on my nerve as he took his sweet time hugging it out with the fam and dispensing pep talks, and I know, I know, you can't blame Jackson Curtis for that... but I guess actors will milk the moment.<br /><br />The DVD Special Features include: Writer/Director Roland Emmerich and Co-Writer Harald Kloser record their Teutonic musings on an audio commentary track; an alternate, perhaps too optimistic ending; five deleted scenes (including one in which Helmsley finally loses his cool and pops Anheuser); a feature on \\"Roland Emmerich: The Master of the Modern Epic\\"; and \\"Time for Miracles\\" - Adam Lambert's music video.<br /><br />Two final things: I know it's silly but I kept expecting Danny Glover - who plays the last President of the United States - to somewhere in the story grouse that he's \\"too old for this sh--!\\" Also, Roland Emmerich seems to find Wisconsin amusing. It's kinda weird.lowstone National Park where Jackson Curtis disregards the warning signs posted on a fence and opts to scale the fence with his children, even with one of the kids remarking dubiously: \\"Don't you see the signs?\\" The other is an even more blatant case of reckless endangerment as Jackson takes his young daughter along on a whirlwind search for the crazy DJ, Charlie Frost.

B001OQCV6K|4.0|I really wasn't looking forward to Guy Ritchie's take on Sherlock Holmes, but upon finally giving it a look, the end result is that the film winds up being a surprisingly good and plenty enjoyable romp.  This probably wouldn't be possible were it not for the performances of Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson respectively, who match wits and punches with the demonic Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong).  Beautiful Rachel McAdams is also on board as the fiery Irene Adler, and Ritchie jam-packs the film with so much visual flair and arresting action sequences that it's hard not to enjoy it.  While Downey's dialogue delivery may be occasionally inaudible, and the film's convoluted plot doesn't exactly help matters much, Sherlock Holmes still winds up being a blast regardless.  All in all, purists of the Arthur Conan Doyle creation may not dig what they find here, but regardless of that, Guy Ritchie's take on Sherlock Holmes is a big budget blast that delivers the goods.
0785134352|5.0|My goodness, no wonder there's a movie coming out. What Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. have done here simply calls for a cinematic adaptation, and I am salivating. If you've ever wondered what it'd be like if some fool - and an untrained kinda nerdy high school fool, at that - decides to don a superhero costume and prowl the slimy streets in search of mischief, this'll be an eye-popper.<br /><br />John Hughes never dreamed of something like this in his high school flicks. The central figure is comic-book-reading 16-year-old Dave Lizewski who doesn't boast that tragic a past; no radioactive insects bit him; he wasn't exposed to a magic word; and he's not an orphan from an exploded planet. To quote Dave Lizewski, his origin is he was bored. But under Mark Millar's insanity, Dave's story takes on this dark, outrageous, ultra-violent turn while still staying somewhat in the periphery of what's realistic.<br /><br />This trade collects the first eight issues and lets you into an urban bloodbath. Because when you put on a wet suit and start looking for trouble, odds are you're gonna end up bumping against some seriously hard mothereffers. And when your only super powers are perseverance and some talent for soaking up punishment, you'll most likely end up hitting the floor really hard. Dave gets severely pounded his first time going up against some thugs, and then he gets bowled over asss over heel by a hurtling car.<br /><br />Months of recovery from his injuries, and you'd think Dave's learned his lesson. But then Dave puts on the costume again and resumes his night patrols. And then, while bracing some muggers, Dave becomes an overnight online sensation, the first real-life superhero. The Internet even gives him his superhero code name. And soon other costumed freaks are following in his footsteps, including a badasss ten-year-old girl expertly wielding swords. Go throw your hands in the air for the lethal and potty-mouthed Hit-Girl. And, okay, with Hit-Girl, Millar does wander past what's believable. But she's such a cool character that we have to, have to give her a pass.<br /><br />Despite the Rob Liefeld intro, this trade is a jaw-dropping read, but it's horribly suited for children, nuns, and perhaps Armenians. Profanity and nudity are a healthy presence. Let me say that KICK-ASS is bloody and brutal and subversive and simply in your damn f----- face, and Millar shows you why no one's actually gotten away with putting on a costume and stomping on amoral lowlifes in real life. Artist John Romita, Jr. comes in with some of his best stuff and there's even that smidgen of that Frank Miller vibe in his art. Saying that this series is violent is to understate matters, kinda like suggesting that Big Daddy exhibits questionable parenting skills. I've already said that Mark Millar is insane, and I'm sticking to that. But the guy is also a master of his craft, and so we eat up his dish of bloody visceral bombast, and I also relish how Dave and, later, Red Mist go about on their new careers (Meanwhile, Big Daddy & Hit-Girl's relationship is really too dysfunctional to be relatable). So is this an unflinching, credible look at costumed vigilantes in the real world? Probably more so than not. The dialogue, by the way, rings true, as does Dave Lizewski. And the story is funny as well. I laughed my titmice off at what happens when Dave arrives at the moment in which he feels he ought to start leaping rooftop to rooftop. Dave Lizewski is a compelling character, but I think the kid is seriously disturbed. Still doesn't keep me from saying that his alter ego absolutely friggin' rules!es wander past what's believable.

B001KO3FFW|5.0|This was a really great first album. Most all the songs written by him I loved this album and can't wait until he releases his next CD but wonder how in the world he will be able to top it. David Cook's voice and his lyrics really are in tip top shape. I'm not a huge idol fan in that every thing the winners put out or the runners up for that matter I'm going to run and buy. But I waited impatiently for this one to come out and I was not disappointed in the least. You won't regret buying this album. Its right up there with Nickleback, Shinedown, Red hot Chili peppers, ect....but better.

It was a great read and I finished it in three days!

Although he will admit there is a time to procrastinate and it can be a tool. That I have found to be true. If looking for some new insite this is not the book. If looking for many old ideas from many people this is your book.
B002MRROKI|1.0|One of Nirvana's dignified live shows totally butchered and released with one of the worst modern sound mixes to ever disgrace my ears. If you're the type that endures low-bitrate, compressed to hell mp3s that sound like they're playing straight out of a tin can, you'll be smitten with the audio mix on this CD.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the obviously fake crowd inclusion on every beginning and ending of every track herein. It's a nuisance on the legacy of the original recording and the band's performance. The band's screwin' around and occasional bantering are completely excluded, as well as the infamous performance of Shocking Blue's \\"Love Buzz\\" in which frontman Kurt Cobain actually takes time to tune his guitar while bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl continue to play through the song.<br /><br />Yeah, I still own this, despite the sodomy that Geffen put it through. If you're really wanting a nearly-authentic \\"Live At Reading\\" experience, get the DVD release, instead.
B002YOKVU4|5.0|A step up from the DVD's video quality, at least as I recall. If you are a big fan of the movie, it's worth getting this version.
1439130833|5.0|Let me start off by saying I'm not big on Self-Help books (this is the only I've ever read). I actually do not view this book as such, instead - for me - it is based on a solid theory grounded on a simple law of physics.<br />I highly recommend this book. It is a very short reading, so you won't have wasted much time even if you don't believe the theory. In that case, you still come out better by exploring this intriguing paradigm.
B002POMLHY|2.0|So I've been a Breaking Benjamin fan for a few years, and I was honestly excited for this CD.  But I knew something was wrong when I saw it was titled \\"Dear Agony,\\" and what I was feared was happening to one of my favorite bands became a clear fact.  They'd sold out to the undying masses of pre-teen girls who want to hear a guy be \\"soft and heartfelt.\\"  But those are just the lyrics.    Granted, there are quite a few good, heavy riffs on this albums that I do enjoy, but they almost always come in on the beginning of the songs, and then just teeter off onto these melodic parts that sound like they'd fit better in some alt rock song, not in what I've come to know as Breaking Benjamin.  Songs like \\"Give me a sign,\\" \\"Into the Nothing,\\" \\"What lies beneath,\\" \\"Anthem of the Angels,\\" and \\"Dear Agony\\" just utterly destroy this album for me, and do their best to persuade me to skip over the saving graces of this album, namely \\"Fade Away,\\" \\"I Will Not Bow,\\" and \\"Lights Out.\\"    My problem with that first group of songs is that they completely diverge from what I want from a band, they stay to their original sound in a song, for the most part.  For example, \\"Lights Out\\" starts heavy in your face, stays heavy in your face, and ends heavy in your face.  \\"Into the Nothing\\" starts with a heavy distorted-as-hell riff, and then goes into these whiny lyrics combined with what I can only describe as a riff I would expect a 12 year old emo kid to come up with after he breaks up with his girlfriend.  It's false advertising.    I know on past records, they have had at least one song which one could call a \\"slow\\" or a \\"lighter\\" song, and that's perfectly fine.  If Disturbed can write a song like \\"Darkness\\" and then still come out with an album like Indestructible, I don't care.  But this is taking it one step too far.  Had they written more songs like \\"Fade Away,\\" or in other words, written songs like they used to, I wouldn't consider this album such a disappointment.    Until their next album comes out and pulls a 180 degree turn, Breaking Benjamin is a band on hiatus circa 2006, and someone is just parading around with their name.
B00337KMAA|3.0|In most books or movies, the main character goes through some kind of traumatic event or experience, and emerges changed in some way. Sometimes the change is so exaggerated that it isn't believable, but, when done right, there *is* always some kind of a change. In this film, I kept rooting for the borderline-unlikeable Ryan Bingham to change in some perceptible way and, though he comes close, that doesn't happen. Also, the \\"plot twist' with Alex is too easy to guess. Still, this film has its moments and the irony that even corporate hatchet men may fall victim to technology is intriguing.
B00000DG1R|2.0|In my youth, I listened avidly to the commercial music of the eighties, and aimed at one point to collect everything I coudl find from a limited-edition chart book compiled by radio station 3XY.<br /><br />Duran Duran, whom I thought of as a group with the same kind of \\"bad boy\\" image as [[ASIN:B00005QGAX Michael Jackson]] owing to the lyrics of \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\", were a band I had limited attraction to because even mainstream critics like [[ASIN:0679737294 Rolling Stone]] and [[ASIN:0306805820 Robert Christgau]] hated them. Still, because my brother, at the time a much more discriminating listener than I was naturally attuned to be, seemed to think Duran Duran were good enough as to recommend at least their first two albums.<br /><br />With hindsight, by which I have realised that the electronic synthesisers that dominated commercial music of the eighties really are very derivative and dated, I can still say some things about Duran Duran that are not as bad as about many artists (e.g. [[ASIN:B0000269Y8 Paul Young]]) who were criticised less by the critical establishment around the time grunge broke up any praise for commercial music of the eighties among most critics. This because their music is in places very effective and maintaining a reasonable degree of listenability on repeated listenings. This is because the songs are so catchy as to be exceptionally memorable when first listened to, regardless of the fact that there is not much musical substance apart from the saxophone solo on \\"Rio\\" that makes that song into a drama and undoubtedly the best song on \\"Greatest\\". The unusually tight (for this type of music) groove further adds to this. \\"Girls on Film\\", whose intro features the most listenable effects on any 1980s hit song and manages to be funny in a way uncommon in a decade when pop musicians were often focused on fighting Thatcher and Reagan.<br /><br />It is unsurprising but unfortunate that the qualities that even today when 1980s synthesisers sound terrible made Duran Duran's early singles reasonably listenable were not carried over beyond their first couple of years. By the time of \\"Union of the Snake\\" they were trying to turn into politics but made enough of a mess that the song becomes silly rather than satirical. \\"The Reflex\\", more than their earliest songs, shows all the terrible aspects of 1980s music, and the ballads \\"New Moon on Monday\\" and \\"Wild Boys\\" (taken from the [[ASIN:0802133312 William Burroughs novel]]) shows this up even worse, with the former being the worst type of power ballad from the period. Then, their later work, including the comeback single \\"Ordinary World\\", is just as bad even if the sound is somewhat updated.<br /><br />All in all, whilst the early singles like \\"Rio\\" and \\"Girls on Film\\" are entertaining, there is little more to \\"Greatest\\" than that.n's early singles reasonably listenable were not carried over beyond their first couple of years.

0393075966|1.0|Economists disagree among themselves, of course, but Stiglitz goes beyond mere disagreement, scorning details and nuance, Stiglitz doesn't hesitate to distort the facts to prove his point. On one page, he writes that the real-estate market crumbled because new owners could obtain 100 percent mortgage credit, putting nothing down; on the next page, he commiserates with the \\"millions of home owners who have lost the savings of their life\\" when they could not repay their loans. But they had no savings to start with, as Stiglitz has just explained!   Freefall is of no help in understanding the origins of the current crisis or in determining how to remedy it. When Stiglitz attacks market fundamentalism as the cause of all evil, he does not stop to consider how such a regime led the world into unprecedented economic growth from 1983 to 2008.   How dare Stiglitz write that Eastern Europeans have been the victims of the Washington consensus imposed by market fundamentalists, when the free market has drawn Eastern Europe out of poverty?  One bizarre recommendation he praises Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries on earth, for its new freeways, which he hopes will inspire public infrastructure programs in the United States.  Stiglitz feels compelled to remind the reader that he is not a socialist: he only advocates a better world. His utopia would replace the failed market fundamentalism by striking the right balance between market and state. What would such an arrangement look like? Stiglitz doesn't elaborate, but he hints repeatedly that the world would be a better and more ethical place if he were in charge. For those who already fear the Obama administration's anti-market bias, think how much worse it could be: Stiglitz could be working there! We better keep him writing fiction!  One receives the Nobel Prize in economics for research in a specific area, Milton Friedman used to say, but prize winners then tend to believe that they've been implicitly granted the right to express their personal, nonscientific opinions about everything. Stiglitz's Nobel Prize on market asymmetry was well deserved. His opinions on everything else are just opinions and deserve to be treated as such.
B0000027RL|2.0|At the beginning of the 1990s, the very time I was moving from childhood to adolescence, there was supposedly a huge makeover of the popular rock scene by which the glam metal that had previously dominated the charts was replaced by a much harder and starker sound that became known as \\"grunge\\".<br /><br />In reality, however, the \\"grunge\\" of the 1990s actually had all the worst aspects of the hair metal of the 1980s, only turned into a new form. Instead of simply overproducing the rhythm section to create an artificially dense drum sound as was typical of such 1980s bands as [[ASIN:B000026BDY Whitesnake]], grunge turned this overblown sound into harder guitar that people thought was far more emotional and passionate. In fact, when listened to carefully, grunge has as little emotional depth as most hair metal, even though the singers generally sing with a rougher voice.<br /><br />In contrast to the totally noisy - and for me completely unlistenable - sound of [[ASIN:B000003TA5 Nirvana]], Pearl Jam did at times emphasise melody rather than overblowing their sound, at least in their earliest days before the band began to try to hide from the commercial acclaim it had won. This is seen to some affect on \\"Alive\\", which even if it does not do anything that previous pop songs did not, still sounds quite heartfelt and energetic. However, the band fails by and large to build on this level of power in the rest of \\"Ten\\", wiht the result that on the whole it cannot be called a serious success.
B002LC2DQ4|1.0|According to Wikipedia, this format is officially obsolete as of 2010.  Olympus created the xD card format as a way to lock in proprietary control on their cameras, and they soon learned it was a huge mistake.  Nothing exists over 2gb and they are slow as molasses.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|I was introduced to Cook's music when I saw him in concert in Colorado.  I bought this album as soon as I got home and I have listened to it all the way through at least a hundred times.  It is a great blend of erotic guitar and latin drums that fits well with a long drive or a night at home in front of the fire.  You will not be dissapointed.
B003B13QQU|4.0|Look, if you don't have a sense of humor or any twinges of nostalgia for the early '80s, avoid this album like the plague.  It is not for you.  But if you don't have an enormous stick up your rump, you're going to get a big kick out of Head First.  Goldfrapp manage to successfully mine very-early '80s synth pop for what's probably the most listenable album of their career.      Now, one could certainly argue that we had enough of Abba, and ELO, and Kim Carnes, and Olivia Newton-John the first time around.  But I have to admit that every single track on this record plasters a huge goofy grin on my face, as Goldfrapp mines -- in an entirely non-ironic way, I might add -- an astounding array of early-'80s pop conventions to produce an entirely charming (and infinitely catchy) work.  And it's that combination of technical achievement and solid pop songcraft that makes Head First such an intense sugar rush.    Every track is good, but the lead single \\"Rocket\\" has to be one of the finest pop tunes anybody has crafted in ages, all Reagan-era double entendres wrapped around one hot hook after another.  \\"Alive\\" is the other poppy highlight, with a glittering synth fill that could transport the listener straight to Xanadu.  I had to check the mirror to make sure a Member's Only jacket hadn't materialized on my back.  The compelling \\"Believer\\" strongly recalls the Kim Carnes single \\"Voyeur\\" (remember when she was at the pop vanguard?), while the title track plays like some long lost Abba hit.  And of course who could forget the deliciously naughty \\"Shiny And Warm\\", or the scrumptious, Motels-esque \\"I Wanna Life\\"?    The album closes with the lovely, experimental \\"Voicething\\", but truth be told it's less impressive than the pop tracks that it follows.  I've never heard anybody *successfully* recreate the essence of an era the way Goldfrapp have here on Head First.  It's ultimately a loving tribute to the end of the great era of radio-driven pop music.      That market would soon fragment, thanks both to technology (the Walkman, the CD), and the rise of polarizing genres (rap, metal), all of which was supposedly an improvement according to music critics.  Thirty years later, listening to Head First, I'm afraid I'd have to question that conclusion.  Head First may be sugary enough to rot every tooth in your head, but a pure-candy diet has to be healthier than choking on the kind of nihilistic (or materialistic) crap that largely took its place over the past 20 years.  Compared to that, Head First's sweet sounds of 1981 seem shockingly liberated, forward-looking and free.  I'm not quite sure how they did it, but Goldfrapp have somehow made their trip back to 1981 the most subversive thing I've heard in a long, long time.
0307266303|5.0|Born to Run is an excellent book; a mixture of travel and culture, biological anthropology and inspirational running writing.  Ostensibly the book is about ultrarunning and the journey towards a 50 mile endurance event with a tribe in Mexico but it's really so much more than that.  The author explores our running heritage and proposes that we are really born to run, being designed as running animals.<br /><br />If you've got any interest in running from the recreational jogger right through to the elite ultrarunner then I'd heartily recommend this book. It's very well written, interesting, engaging and very compelling.  I read it in within a couple of days because I just wanted to keep on reading.  The only thing I would have liked to have seen would be some photographs of the people and places that MacDougall mentions but that doesn't detract from the great book that this is.<br /><br />By the end of the book you will want get out outside and run barefoot for hours.  Inspirational stuff.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|This is an album that definitely took me way too long to get. The first song I heard was watching the music video for \\"Rebellion (Lies)\\", which I liked but didn't flip out over. Later I heard \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" thanks to a friend, and thought it was pretty awesome. I knew how much people liked the album and was interested in buying it, but somehow it didn't end up happening for a long time. I didn't see it often in stores, and when I did the price wasn't right for some stupid reason. I almost forgot about it until they recorded a new version of \\"Wake Up\\" for the trailer to Where the Wild Things Are, but that was still about half a year before I finally bought the damn thing. And now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long. Funeral is one of my favorite albums of the last decade, ten tracks of incredibly consistent musical bliss without a single misstep to be heard.    The married couple of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne are the main songwriters and vocalists of the band, although there's currently five other permanent members. Win gets the lion's share of the lead vocals, although Régine's presence is pretty frequently evident and she does sing two of the last three tracks. There are lots of different instruments contributing to the sound, although the rock mainstay of the guitar is pretty frequently prevalent, and the percussion might be the single most important element in many of the songs. The whole Neighborhood suite that dominates the first half is pretty brilliant, with \\"Une Année sans Lumière\\" breaking it up a bit with a nice change of pace. The second half keeps up the pace, with two of the five singles, some of the more emotionally affecting songs, and a few of the more interesting cases where songs will completely change gears partway through and become something else. The background of the album is a bit sad, with it being written and recorded at a time when an unusually high number of band members' relatives dying, greatly influencing thesongs (and the album's title, obviously), though it's hard to listen without coming out feeling good, thanks to the passionate, exuberant intensity with which they seem to tackle every single track. Just great from start to finish.
B0031OCY2E|1.0|Intro: This is a review of the movie as an experience. Look elsewhere if you want an overview of the story, or how well the movie reflects actual events and people.<br /><br />For those who would be satisfied with a movie that was simply a collection of goofy and absurdist scenes, I expect that the pacing here is much to slow to be satisfying, although in the second half it becomes noticeably less slow.<br /><br />For those expecting more, the basic problem here is with how the lead character Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon) is portrayed.  It is immediately reminiscent of the William H Macy character in [[ASIN:0792846427 Fargo]]: A doofus in over his head who is flailing about.  However, in Fargo there was a progression to that state--here it starts at that point and doesn't change much.<br /><br />Even without the Fargo baggage, the Whitacre character is too big a goof to be sympathetic or funny.  My first impression was that he was an incompetent bottom level manager. When he was identified as a top manager, I couldn't help but think of him as a fraud, thereby undermining everything that was to come. In addition to his being a fraud within the movie, it was a fraud on the audience: Such a personality would never have gotten a PhD (from Cornell), much less risen so high in a major corporation (most people forced to work with such a person would be screaming and throwing things at him before the end of the first day).<br /><br />The core of the movie's story is the revelation of a series of deceptions and lies.  The typical dramatic treatment, whether serious or humorous, is akin to a roller-coaster: It elevates your confidence that you know what is happening, then suddenly puts you into free fall, adding twists and turns to increase your disorientation. You start to climb out of that, only to be hit by additional drops.  This movie has no such drama: It just goes gently and slowly round and round, the tone being closer to enumerating the lies than to revealing them.  Perhaps Whitacre was intended to be played by an improvisational comic who was expected to fill in such texture?<br /><br />As a movie, the significant story elements should have been _seen_ and not merely commented on by characters.  For example, Whitacre is presented as being maniac-depressive (bipolar), but we never _see_ that roller-coaster of emotions--the portrayal is very flat.  At the very end, statements of various characters provide some evidence of this (Nigerian scam, compulsive over-consumption).  Additionally, when part of the story is whether his underlying mental problems were triggered or exacerbated by his role as an informant, how could they not show this, but simply comment on it at the end?<br /><br />The script has characters _saying_ that Whitacre is brilliant, but I remember only a couple of scenes where he _appeared_ even mildly clever.<br /><br />We are _told_ that even after all the revelations of Whitacre's crimes and lying that some of the Feds (FBI and prosecutors) strongly advocated clemency for him, but from the movie, I couldn't guess why.  And during the extended investigation, there is no sense of the passage of time--other than dates being flashed on the screen. Nor do we _see_ the stresses on Whitacre: The script trivializes his risks and sacrifices by consigning them to asides in the disconnected goofy scenes that constitute this movie.<br /><br />This movie seems to have been intended to be both funny and interesting, but is neither.played by an improvisational comic who was expected to fill in such texture?

I love all of Amazon's products and I look forward to getting cables from them in the future, because it has great quality, hassle free packaging, and a great price!
B0038P80CO|4.0|Some of these reviews are very eloquent and seem to be written by people with a great deal of entertainment expertise.  All I can say about this movie is that I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish. It was a complete surprise. I thought it might be just another cheap sci-fi dud like we've all seen. Not so! If there was a negative I would say it leaned a bit toward the gory side. Not gratuitously though. And what a complete twist at the end! I think this movie deserves a solid \\"A\\".
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This Emma is by far the best film/tv series of the book.  I haven't liked the other Emma adaptations, as they tend to portray Emma as smug and irritating. Romolai Garai's Emma was charming, artless, and quite wonderful.  Jane Fairfax was good, engaging and sympathetic.  I was really pleased with Mr. Knightley, as he looked hip, acted noble, and had great chemistry.  The locations were really beautiful.  Highly recommended.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|but for a movie put out in 2008 it is pricey. You would think it'd be down to $13 or $14 by now.<br /><br />To the movie: I've seen it a half dozen times and it still never fails to get to me. The animation itself is well done, the storyline exceptional. Before 5 minutes are up, you've already fallen in love with WALL-E and want him to get his lost love. The, uh, \\"courtship\\" between WALL-E and EVE is hilarious. I crack up over the shopping carts every time.<br /><br />Not to give away too much and spoil it, WALL-E is alone on the garbage heap known as Earth, except for his roach companion. A space ship shows up with a flying robot, EVE, here to check for plant life. WALL-E is immediately smitten and works to get her (it's??)attention even if it means following her wherever she/it goes.<br /><br />Is it worth the inflated new price?  Probably.  Truly this is a very good movie, fine for the whole family, and one you'll watch more than once.

0380977788|4.0|The story of Coraline takes place in a house that has been divided up into flats as they are called in the UK. Here in the United States, we might call them apartments or condominiums. Anyhow, Coraline lives in one such unit with her parents, who both work. Being the intrepid explorer-type, Coraline meets all of her neighbors and explores her home... One day, she finds a door, but it won't open. Being curious, Coraline asks her mother about the door...<br /><br />The big, old house where Coraline and her parents live strikes me as being a good place to set up a haunted house on Halloween... and the story is just about that scary. Enough to give the reader a creepy feeling, but not so creepy as if something is going to reach out and grab you.  Well, okay, the author does reach out and grab your attention with his story about Coraline and the things behind a door that only she can open and pass through.<br /><br />Recommended for kids age 7 and up who don't scare easily and who think a haunted house is cool, not creepy. This review has been simultaneously posted on Amazon.com, Dragonviews, and LibraryThing.
B0035IV7PQ|5.0|I was deployed to Iraq last year. My response to this film was visceral (I suspect similar to other veterans). I didn't relax at all, the film grabbed me with its intensity from the get go and din't release.    I had some issues with aspects. There is a very strict \\"no alcohol policy\\" for US troops. Some of the actions taken by the EOD team are reckless and, I don't believe would have happened. For instance, the SFC James car jacking a haji insisting he be taken to \\"Beckham's house, then running back to the base. Going off to pursue the bombers on the side streets (there are men who's mission is to do that and they would know where each other would be, making friendly fire incidents less likely).    The emotion, the filthy streets, the behavior of the \\"Iraqis,\\" the use of weapons, the sense of \\"I could die at any moment\\" are all very real. As they drive around on patrol and going to mission ANYTHING can be a threat, a box on the side of the road, a dead animal, a young child on a bicycle (bike bomb), an old lady (she can throw a grenade). As I said, it is a filthy country with, seemingly, no sanitation, determining what is a threat and what is not comes from experience and from constant vigilance, all evident in the film.    This film represents only a small aspect of war in the Middle East, but it does provide an excellent insight.

B00337KM2S|3.0|George Clooney is very talented and not bad to look at so I generally go to see whatever he's in.  A few of my favorite films are \\"Michael Clayton\\" and \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\".    Clooney as Ryan Bingham is a  good choice since he can pull off the role of a self centered professional who fire's personnel for a living and still be likable.  Vera Farmiga as Alex was well done too.  Her role seems ordinary as a kind of \\"comfortable in her own skin\\" and friendly colleague if it weren't for the duel life she leads.  But Anna Kendrick's portrayal of Natalie a ivy leagued go getter with book smarts but no common sense was a much more interesting character to watch albeit an unpleasant personality.  And Jason Bateman always plays a shady fast talker very well.    But my problem with Up In The Air is some parts of it didn't seem to complement other areas.    In the introduction some people didn't seem authentic talking about losing there jobs.  After the fact I can certainly respect private citizens talking about there real terminations.  But in the theater I was thinking wow some of these extras cant act.......    Ryan Bingham's family seemed odd and  frumpy compared to his well dressed, charming and dignified persona.  They also seemed to be mad with him simply because he lives his own life away from the brood.  Ryan's older sister specifically seemed cold, angry and needy.  I really couldn't understand why adults would be furious because a sibling was successful and living on his own?     The whole wedding and Danny McBride's entering the film was confusing since I expected to laugh right away because his comedy is usually delivered with a straight face.  Whenever he was in a scene I couldn't take it seriously because of his smirk.    If the message Up In The Air was trying to convey is to value friends and family the characters in the film that represented that lifestyle were contradictory, selfish and unlikable.  Natalie spoke of wanting to get married and having afamily as if it were on one of her flow charts to be checked off like a task.  Alex had a family she was willing to cheat on regularly.  And Ryan's siblings were willing to include him in their life as long as he lived by their rules and geographical boundaries.       Seemed to me Ryan Bingham was the only honest sympathetic person in the film.  And my advise to him is, \\"Ryan if you ever start thinking about what your missing, don't.\\"
B0009A40ES|4.0|American Psycho stars Christian Bale as the status conscious Patrick Bateman, who is also a ghoulish killing machine. The movie satirizes the yuppie culture of materialism, using a modern day \\"Ted Bundy\\" serial killer.  American Psycho is set in the 1980's and Patrick Bateman is a broker in New York.  His colleagues are young men his age, who vie for the best business cards, restaurant reservations, ties, and suits.  It all seems so meaningless and sterile as they arrogantly discuss what trendy restaurant to eat dinner at each night at a local club.<br /><br />Patrick Batemen lives in a expensive New York apartment and starts each morning with a shower and narcissistic regimen of skin care.  He is misogynistic, and self centered, spending time with same-aged colleagues sharing a obsession over classy business cards, designer glasses, ties and suits.  His public personality hides a murderous rage at small frustrations.  When his anger mounts then it is taken out on anyone, including his do-worker, prostitutes, homeless men and models.  During the murders he plays music and critiques the songs of Huey Lewis and Phil Collins.  Chloe Sevigny plays Patrick's secretary and Reese Witherspoon plays his fiance.  Both are wonderful actresses and give the movie some depth.  Although there are many murders in the movie, the actual killing scenes are not graphic, although plenty of blood and bodies are seen throughout.  Patrick gets away with everything with his public persona - clean cut professional - just like Ted Bundy.  Even as Patrick is loading a full body bag in the car a friend comes up and comments what a gorgeous bag - is it Armani?  Patrick grunts and groans as he puts the body in the trunk and responds the correct designer.  There is no one who really suspects him, and he has a lawyer who covers his trial when an outside detective starts asking questions.  He is highly protected  in a world of money and style.<br /><br />American Psycho is a great satire on Yuppie culture.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|The film was beyond credulity from the beginning. To start with, the sets looked quite artificial. It attempted to create a wizard out of Holmes, and instead made viewers wondering how they could have been taken in by the ads. The film bore no relationship to the Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This 'divorce from reality' was compounded by a number of scenes attempting to show Holmes as a master of action/fisticuffs (quasi 'Lethal Weapon\\") - carried to such inane and inconsistent levels that even teenagers would be put off. As for the plot, an 18th century version of a James Bond movie villain attempting world takeover, it also lacked credibility; it was also difficult to understand the mumbling dialogue. Finally, in a final attempt to somehow cover up all the silliness, the audience is also 'treated' to 18th-century science-fiction involving transmitted signals, and some sort of quasi-romance involving Holmes and the former leading bad girl. Couldn't wait for it to end. Must have been dreamed up by Robert Downey Jr. (Holmes) during one of his drugged out periods. Not worthy of the world's greatest detective. Terrible - the worst part is at the end where they obviously set the stage for a sequel.

Lewis is an amazing writer who makes you laugh out loud (which totally startles the sleeping cat!) and keeps you going until the last page. It will make you rethink baseball every time you watch whether you are in a stadium or your living room. It might even make you an Oakland A's fan.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I thought this knife would be my \\"grail\\" knife but the large handle killed it for me.    Overall I rated the knife 5 out of 5 stars... just seems so well thought out, almost perfect in every sense for a general purpose camping knife except one, the handles. I really wanted to love this knife but the slippery handle was a little bit too large for my hand even considering I have medium/large hands.    If the grips were a little bit thinner or the grips were made of a less slippery material or had at least a checkered texture for better gripping, then I wouldn't have returned it.    Otherwise, for the much larger handed folks out there, I can understand why this would rate 5 stars. Heck, I even rated it 5 stars eventhough I returned it...it's perfect but just not fitted for me.

B003102JDM|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best movies that has come down the pike in some time. It gives a humorous but serious view, not only of life in the USA in the 50-60's, but also an informative point of view of Jewish-American culture. Most Importantly is its insight into the human drama that we all are a part of; anyone from any background can understand the difficulties and the joys that Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) anguished over. It is as Henry David Thoreau would say, \\" We lived our lives of quiet desperation.\\"  Poor Larry, he could not understand from his rational point of view that sometimes life is what it is. As Clive's father (Stephen Park) advised him, \\"Accept the mystery.\\" In the end the advise from Rabbi Marshak (Alan Mandell) to the son, Danny (Aaron Wolff) best fits it all, \\"Be a good boy.\\" This movie should have received more attention than it did; it should have received an Academy Award.    This is a five star movie.

B002XUL6RG|5.0|Faced with headlines about Cuban prisoners starving themselves to death and the unsolved status of Guantanamo Bay prisoners, this movie about IRA prisoners in Northern Ireland begs many questions but provides few answers.  Are they criminals in a glorified gang? The British answer would be yes.  Are any of the resistance methods employed by the IRA effective? Who is being punished more by the no clothes no cleaning strike?<br /><br />The questions of ethics and politics are neatly folded into the various characters of the cast.  Sands is clearly right to stand for status as a political prisoner.  The British jailer is clearly right to hate the 2-bit gangsters who drape Irish nationalism over their crimes.  The priest is right in loving the sinner but expressing serious doubts about the virtues of a hunger strike.  The nurses are right in caring for their patient and hating what he does as he slowly wastes away.<br /><br />The acting carries this film and prevents it from being heavy-handed or preachy.  Each actor carries his point of view so confidently and completely that the viewer can't help but empathize with the horrific events that each actor confronts.<br /><br />The film work is excellent.  Nothing too showy or gimicky: no one is trying to make a faux-documentary here.  The little details captured by camera particularly in the early scenes during the no wash strike a powerful and disturbing.  The body of sands as he detriorates is painfully vivid.<br /><br />After it is finished, this film leaves the big questions open and will make viewers want to talk about some of the complexities brought out in the picture.  Ultimately, I think, the one question each character forces us to confront is:  how can  mankind be so cruel to each other and yet so oblivious to other's suffering at the same time?

B000E1MXSW|5.0|Loosely based on the life Marie Louise-Habets, THE NUN'S STORY by Kathryn Hulme was a best-selling novel of 1956, but it drew little interest from the film industry until director Fred Zinnemann brought the project to Audrey Hepburn's attention.  The result was a bidding war for the project with Warner Bro.s the winner, and although the studio feared the subject would be too esoteric for most audiences, THE NUN'S STORY not only picked up numerous Academy Award nominations, it was among the most financially successful films of 1959--and one of Audrey Hepburn's greatest box office successes.<br /><br />The story concerns Gabrielle van der Mal, the daughter of a noted Belgian surgeon, who enters a convent with what she believes to be a true calling from God and in the hope that her medical experience and skills will be of use to the church.  Now known as Sister Luke, she is xcited by an assignment to the Belgian Congo, she is disappointed when she finds her assignment is to a European hospital instead of a native hospital.  With passing time--and under the possibly negative influence of Dr. Fortunati (Peter Finch)--she begins to place her calling as a nurse before her calling to the church, and as such she begins to question whether she had a true calling as a nun.  While in the Congo she contracts tuberculosis, and although she recovers she is returned to Beglium, where she finds her place in the convent increasingly unteneble, and with the onset of World War II she finds she cannot maintain the neutrality the church demands.  Significantly torn, she elects to leave the convent, and in a powerfully evocative scene does this, walking away into an unknown future and an unknown fate.<br /><br />Although some may find it a bit too long, THE NUN'S STORY is among the most visually beautiful films of its era, filmed on location in the Congo and in Europe, flawlessly costumed, perfectly filmed.  The direction is subtle, and each performance shines in a truly memorable cast that includes Peggy Ashcroft, Patricia Collinge, Colleen Dewhurst, Mildred Dunnock, Edith Evans, Dean Jagger, Barbara O'Neill, and Beatrice Straight--as well as the aforementioned Peter Finch, who adds a certain sexual tension to the mix.  But the focus is on Audrey Hepburn, and if any film proves that Hepburn was not just an actress but an artist, it is THE NUN'S STORY.  She so beautifully captures Sister Luke's spiritual tug of war.  At the film's conclusion one feels that Sister Luke has demanded too much of herself, and--unable to acheive spiritual perfection--has almost deliberately faultered into a more worldly point of view.  What ever the interpretation made, THE NUN'S STORY is brilliant, start to finish, and not to be missed.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewery Ashcroft, Patricia Collinge, Colleen Dewhurst, Mildred Dunnock, Edith Evans, Dean Jagger, Barbara O'Neill, and Beatrice Straight--as well as the aforementioned Peter Finch, who adds a certain sexual tension to the mix.

B0027VTMAE|5.0|Movies made for public consumption must be for entertainment, not for analysis for an award.  The Ninth Gate is way more enjoyable than iconic movies like Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.  There is unjustified over-analysis of this movie, which stifles enjoyment.<br /><br />The cinematography was excellent, justifying the wide-screen.  The DTS soundtrack was impressive.  Colour saturation was intense, putting the Blu-ray to good effect.  Comments on the Blu-ray version having washed out colours are groundless.  When light streams in behind the actors through library and caf&eacute; windows, there is going to be less colour in areas lit by shafts of light: photography 101.  There are a lot of scenes taking place in libraries, and there is a lot of backlighting in the movie.  There is no colour washout at all: the skin tones are outstanding, as confirmed by the bare bodies of Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner.<br /><br />Lack of features?  Roman Polanski's detailed and non-stop commentary was the best I have heard in a very long time - it is virtually an instructional lecture on movie making.  This commentary, pleasantly, is never once self-serving or self-congratulatory.  It incorporates into the narrative all the relevant material normally found in \\"Special Features\\".  Besides one gets to watch this marvellous movie one more time, the original feature not having boring moments helps making this exhaustive commentary readily consumable.  The drawings in \\"Special Features\\" have characters bearing an uncanny resemblance to various actors.<br /><br />Unresolved ending?  Roman Polanski wisely leaves the final encounter between Johnny Depp and the Prince of Darkness to the viewer's imagination.  To be fair, no movie interpretation can possibly come out right, nor can any good come out of it.<br /><br />This Blu-ray does not work on the old Sony BDP-300, but is playable with models Sony BDP-350 and later 2.0 BDPs.<br /><br />Many movies give the feeling \\"I could have written this script myself\\" or \\"another variation of a worn theme\\".  Not this one.  It is compelling and refreshing drama.  Since this story was put to film in 1999, there has rarely been another quite as original.tion of a worn theme\\".  Not this one.

The booklet also contains linernotes by Niall Stokes. Allmusic gave the album 4/5 in their review and so do I. 4/5.
B00361HV7A|5.0|This is a great live album.  If you like The White Stripes or Rock 'n Roll music, buy this.  If you've heard their live music before, you know it's good.  This is them at their current peak ability.  They sound sharp, crisp, frenetic, and on the edge of flying out of control.  Mostly all of the great tracks are there.  There may be one or two that you love missing, but almost everything is there.  It's an enjoyable experience listening to this album.    If you have a record player, buy this.  It sounds great however you listen to it, but listening to it on vinyl feels right.  Plus, Jack White really puts time, effort, and care into his album presentation.  It makes the vinyl version worthwhile.

If you're looking for a concert movie about The White Stripes, don't get this.  Get \\"Under Blackpool Lights.\\"  It is a much more entertaining concert experience, and there aren't the holes in music that this film necissarily must have.    Nothing is deliberately said about the two bandmates that wasn't already known by many.  There are a lot of interesting undertones, but nothing about them is ever confirmed.  Meg breaking down in tears at the end of the movie is moving, but it's nearly impossible to determine what she was crying about.  There are a lot of pieces of the movie like this.  It can be frustrating for the interested viewer, but it does help maintain the mystique that The White Stripes have built around themselves and their band.  That's probably the way they wanted it.  It left me wondering though.  Maybe they wanted that too.

0060557818|5.0|Neil Gaiman writes another novel inextricably linked to mythology, where everyday-man, Richard Mayhew, is sent into a the fantastical and dark underworld of London, against his will. The only way back is to accompany Door, Hunter and the Marquis of Carabas on a strange and dangerous quest.    Richard, or Dick, is an everyman. He lives his life pulled along by an ambitious and dominating girlfriend, his life simply twisting and turning on the wind of fates. And so fate delivers him Door, a girl he finds sprawled on the pavement hurt and damaged. Instead of following his girlfriend he picks her up and cares for her. And that seals his fate. She is the daughter of Lord Portico of the London Beneath, and while he helps her to return, he finds he has become one of the London Beneath himself. Someone who people never notice, or just can't see. And if they do they forget about them immediately.    Now he has to find Door again and regain his place in London above, to do that he accompanies Door on her own quest to find out who killed her family and avenge them. Door is equipped with a singular skill, that is she can make any lock or door open for her. Whoever killed her family is now apparently trying to kill her. She needs help and the Marquis of Carabas is the only man who can help her. Mysterious and strange, the Marquis can only help her so much. He trades and lives on his wits - and he arranges that she should be protected by the best of the best, Hunter. Certainly following them are the utterly terrifying figures of Mr vandemar and Mr Croup.    Throughout the book the links with fairytales (Dick Whittington and the Marquis of Carabas etc) are interspersed with mythology (the mythology of 'Hunter'), with London history and present. Londoners I think will especially appreciate the history of the Underground in here and Christianity - the crucifixion and Angels.    There is black and bleak humour throughout, Mr Vandemar, Mr Croup and the Marquis of Carabas getting the best of them all. And while at times the story seems to have gaping holes in it, everything is carefully filled in at the end making it obvious that these are essential elements in the plot.     I found this an extremely clever novel and a page-turning read. Since I read his book Coraline, I have been absolutely hooked on Gaiman as an author. My top read of his works is American Gods, but I think this book comes a close second. It is full of allusion and allegory and it makes me want to re-read it again and again to pick up those clever little points. A novel you can really sit down and discuss with someone as well. I would recommend it for reading groups.

0061914177|2.0|I had stumbled into Gary's video blog about a year ago. I find his videos entertaining, even though a bit intense, if not crazy. When one of my colleagues brought the book into the office I couldn't resist borrowing it.<br /><br />The book is a very easy read, (maybe 2-3 hours) and sounds, well, just like Gary himself. The ghost-writer has captured his spoken word spot-on. However, the problem with that is that it does not translate well into the written word. If you are going to file this under self-improvement books, it falls short of helping you improve anything. Just because Gary became a success story doesn't mean that his method will apply to everybody or anybody.<br /><br />The examples offered in this book, are overly simplistic if not banal. Making it rich on the internet through passion for bait and tackle? Really Gary? To give Gary credit, the message of this book is great. I would summarize it in \\"If you have talent, passion, dedication and put in the hard work (Hustle), you will become successful and eventually rich!\\"<br /><br />Also, on a side note, I don't agree with the whole building a personal brand process. Philosophically speaking there is more to life than building a personal brand. Putting every thought and every idea into the web is mindless chatter. I think having e sense of privacy is way more important than building a personal brand.<br /><br />At 25.99 CAD, on a 100 point scale I would rate this book a 47, and a give it a major pass.

0786868724|4.0|Have a Little Faith is the story of two men. Albert Lewis (Mitch Albom's childhood Rabbi from New Jersey) and Henry Covington (an inner-city priest in Detroit). Two men who really have nothing in common except for their faith and the inspiration they bring to their congregation and those who they are in contact with.<br /><br />Mitch no longer resides in Jersey and finds it rather odd that he is asked by his Rabbi, Albert Lewis (a/k/a \\"The Reb\\"), to write his eulogy. Firstly, it's been years since Mitch has been in contact with him. And secondly, he isn't dying, at least, not anytime soon. So Mitch makes it a point to spend time with The Reb to get to know him, and thus begins an 8-year long friendship.<br /><br />Henry Covington preaches in a run-down church with a gaping hole in the roof to the poorest and the homeless of Detroit. He's a former drug dealer and spent almost a decade behind bars, but has now turned his life over to God.<br /><br />This is the story of two men, with different beliefs but who have common goals... their faith, their love of God and their congregations.<br /><br />As a fan of Mr. Albom's previous works, I was excited when I finally got the my hands on Have a Little Faith. In its pages you will find everything that you would expect from a Mitch Albom book... faith, inspiration, joy, tears. But for some reason, and I'm saddened to say this, it fell a little flat for me. Don't take me wrong, I truly enjoyed reading about The Reb and Henry Covington, their experiences and their anecdotes. All in all, I felt that it was missing something. It didn't grip me in the way some of his previous books have. In the end, I'm not sure exactly how much I got out of this book, but it is a good story. One that I think should be read and I can easily see that many will enjoy.
0446569895|5.0|Only Ozzy could keep me awake laughing, crying and reminiscing...    As a fan going back to Sabbath (and following Ozzy when the road split), I love everything that he, Sharon and their kids are. Real, no bs, warts and all...    As part of their generation, I'm proud to see he survived everything stupid most of us did (thanks in no small part to the love of Sharon)!    I never even thought about Ozzy doing a bio, but when it was announced, jumped on pre-order like it was the original Ozzfest! Then when it came I absolutely could not force myself to stop reading except to go to the john! As another reviewer stated, I was laughing out loud, sobbing like a baby, and having major flashbacks to stuff I didn't remember but came back like a bad trip...    The honesty and style in which it's written honestly makes you feel like Ozzy is sitting on your patio (with Sharon right next to him) having a conversation about the stuff we remember and the stuff someone else has to remind us of, even tho we were there. So far 3 friends have read it in one sitting and said pretty much the same thing.    Thank you Ozzy!  You will never realize how enjoyable the trip down memory lane became when you put it into words!

B0015DROBO|1.0|This novel fails in almost every aspect: poorly written, bad timing, and has what I would call a miscarried plot. The author wastes endless pages showing off his studies in Nazism, and constrains whole developments into single, almost laconic paragraphs. Even though it catches the reader's interest within the first part, with a somehow well settled mystery situation, the outcome of the story is anything but witty, clever or unpredictable. Every single riddle of this detective styled novel is solved by the disappointing revelation that two of the characters are depraved and insane. Moreover, the idea of relating serial crimes with Bible verses through code numbers is not only a deja-vu, but it is accomplished in the clumsiest way possible. As if all this wasn't enough, the reader is not even granted any sort of credibility, since the reasoning behind most of the main developments is either unrealistically bold, or plainly stupid; hard to swallow even for a teenager.<br />If I were compelled to find something positive about the novel, I would say that the author might have had a kind of inspiration when he conceived the colorful and mostly original Lisbeth Salander's character, and that he might boast here and there with a couple of well accomplished humorous strokes.
B001EN71DG|4.0|We were very happy to get these three movies at such a good price, and when they arrived, we could see where the seller cut some corners.  Don't expect fancy packaging on this set - this is just the bare bones of DVDs, in thin, mass-production cases;  it comes 3 discs, 3 bonus discs, and there does appear to be a bunch of special features, so, regardless of the packaging, we are happy with the purchase - i would not recommend this item for a collector, but we got it for our son, and he doesn't care.  Plus, one of the bonus features is Legos starwars video game, so that's pretty cool.  We haven't played them yet, so cant' comment on the video quality, but i will come back in and edit this review if i have any problems.

0756405890|5.0|I've spent the past hour and a half reading all the negative reviews for this book and I've seen some patterns emerge. First, people criticize the book on matters of preference, not literary quality. Second, people have had a bad reading experience because they expected something different than what the book really is. The truth is, there are many 5 star reviews (that I think the book deserves) that are not written in 5 star fashion. Many people do not know how to properly describe the book in a way that helps possible readers know if they would like it or not.           Here's the thing. I like this book a lot. I think it is one of the best books I've ever read. Here is what it's not: A fast-paced novel, a novel about the epic world-changing deeds of a hero, completely original, for everyone. The novel is not about world-changing feats of heroism. It is a slow-paced book about the development of an incredibly intelligent, but relatively normal boy, how he becomes a legendary figure, and some of the problems he faces in fostering that reputation and living up to it in the end. It is not the most original fantasy novel to ever hit shelves. It's originality comes not from it's world or characters (for goodness' sake, look at the map with the book. It's obviously an adaptation of Europe. Just like middle earth or countless other fantasy settings). The originality comes from subject matter more focused on the coming of age of a young boy and how, due to the existence of his impressive intelligence and the existence of a logical type of magic, certain events shape him into a legendary figure. There are plenty of cliche plot points, but not ones that I couldn't fully relate to. That said, the character is a very intelligent, but often foolish and arrogant, teenage boy. Not everyone can relate to him, but that also doesn't make it a bad book.          What I loved about this book was the main character. I have read many fantasy books with unbelievable characters. Often times, their behavior seems overly emotional or angsty. When I think about the people I know, I feel like people are often times as irrational as characters in those books, but I tend to not be. I can't stand when character conflict is built up on small disagreements that would easily be solved if one person cleared up a misunderstanding by simply talking to the other party. Very few such situations arise in this book which makes me happy because I seldom let those situations arise in my own life. The love story, while simple puppy-love is something myself and all of my friends went through at some point in our teen years, and I love that the main character is afraid of failure and making mistakes. Often times his problems come from lack of action rather than stupidity or brashness. Almost every man, whether he admits it or not, has a deep fear of failure. Kvothe is so real on so many levels, and his actions follow logically with his personality. It was impossible for me not to get fully immersed in the story.          All of that said... one last thing. I would be remiss if I didn't also say that this is the first book I have read that made me cry since I read \\"Where the Red Fern Grows\\" in 5th grade. And I cried like a freaking baby.
0060557818|3.0|I have been anticipating reading this book for quite a while and had finally gotten around to buying and reading it.  I went in thinking that this was going to be an awesome adventure, which, it was.  But, I am used to American authors and they way their books flow.  Gaiman being a British author writes in a stop-flow kind of manner.  The two main villains in the story are hard to understand and needed a dictionary to figure out a lot of the words they were saying.<br /><br />This story is strangely addictive because of how out-there it is in the London Below.<br /><br />Enjoy either way. : )
B001FB4W0W|3.0|The first few episodes of this show I was not so sure I liked it to much. Well I did like it but I like most anything with vampires in it, but all in all the show seamed to me to try to hard to be shocking and cool (and doing this by having characters have sex all the time) not that I mind sex or even graphic sex in a TV show or movie but when there is several long sex scenes in about every episode I start wondering why I did not just pick up a porn movie in the first place. However a little bit into the season the show do get better, the storyline and the characters pick up.<br /><br />The show have some very good and interesting characters, and some who are not so much. The premise of the show is that a few years into the future vampires have stepped forward and declared their presence. They have now become a part of society, partly due to the fact that they drink tru blood, artificial blood. Society is in an uproar over the vampires, some welcoming them and some wanting them hunted down and killed. In some way the show is similar to Alienation in that you have these supernatural creatures which try to become a part of society but there is forces working against that both in human society and inside the supernatural society. Now as often happens in these vampire shows one of the undead fall in love with a human girl. In this case a psychic blond redneck named Sookie. The show is about these two and their relationship as well as the pepole around them and their reactions to vampires suddenly being a part of society.<br /><br />I found True Blood to be an enjoyable show. I however do think that it at times is to redneck and try to hard to be trashy. At times I would love to see a character who do not live in a trailer or a house so run down it is surprising it do not fall a part and who actually have a bit off class. But I do not know, perhaps it is just me being snobby. Anyway True Blood is a good show if you like vampires and it have some interesting plot twists, it is definitely worth watching.worth watching.

B0039UTDFG|1.0|I'm sorry but this has been painful to watch. I love Planet Earth and Blue Planet. I watch both series numerous times a year both at home and as applicable clips in the classroom. My students are amazed and every time I am enthralled. I assigned extra credit for watching this series thinking, just like its predecessors, it would be amazing. The good is that visually, it is fantastic once more and it's educational value in terms of predator prey relationships and adaptation are incredible. Unfortunately, the bad has been suffering through Oprah. Her painfully dull narration is an absolute killer! I don't care for Oprah but it's her show not her voice that bothers me. I had no reason to believe she would do a poor job. Instead I find myself bored, even annoyed by her narration. It's not like I was dying to have Mr. Attenborough narrate another program either. I show four separate series with him as narrator (The Private Life of Plants and Life in the Undergrowth are the other two) and my student's have grown accustomed to, almost tired of him. I thought I might grab the alternate version of this just for that reason. After suffering through this on TV, now I can't wait for Mr. Attenborough's version! I can't wait to hear some life brought back into this fantastic presentation.

B003102JDM|2.0|Weird or pointless movies can be original and even good as the Coen Brothers have shown in \\"Fargo\\" and other films. However, if that is the only kind of film you make, no matter how artfully done, it becomes boring and is no longer new. This film has some value to non-Jews who are curious about some of the faith's terms, practices, beliefs, etc. However, a documentary would have been a much better way to learn. The characters use all kinds of Hebrew terms in the movie and it must have been perplexing for non-Jews in the theaters. On the DVD they give you a dictionary so you can translate. The brothers try to make the film somewhat interesting by putting this Jewish family in the 1960's Midwest (mainly because that is where and when they grew up) and have things go wrong in the father's life but to me it was a pointless, tedious mess. Lots of great production design and CGI work done in the service of a story with no reason for being. They tack on a silly made-up fable before the main titles that runs for around 10 minutes and has NOTHING to do with the movie. The Brothers even admit they just wanted to make a short fable so they used this movie to film one. It adds nothing to the film's story but I guess if someone else is footing the bill, why not? They even say it is like a cartoon before a movie. It is non even a real Jewish fable, it is totally from their imagination and plays more like a Stephen King short. Thanks for wasting my time, Coens. The reason I give this movie two stars is because the actors do a great job with very little to work with. It is sad to see talent wasted on a truly wretched script. Starting with a pointless fable and ending with head-scratching tornado, this movie seems to have been made on LSD. Black comedy? Nope. Just black like a void.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|This movie mixes dynamic plot, vivid scenery, over-the-top characters, shocking violence, and subtle humor in a quirky way that perhaps only Quentin Tarantino could come up with.  In that sense, this movie is very much a reincarnation of Pulp Fiction, although of course the details are all different.<br /><br />This sort of movie can't possibly appeal to everyone, as the broad spectrum of previous reviews attests, but I personally found it highly entertaining and well worth the time.  Indeed, I was so gripped by this movie - frequently wanting to know what was going to happen next but rarely able to predict it - that the time just flew by and it felt like my attention didn't even lapse for a second.  True, some of the violence is hard to watch, but the movie's pervasive aura of humor subtly reminds us that this is make-believe stuff, so that helps to soften the blow (both figuratively and literally).  And of course humor is partly a matter of taste, but I personally found myself laughing out loud many times during this movie (Brad Pitt's character is the funniest in the movie, and I think he nails the role).<br /><br />What are the general lessons from the movie?  I don't think this movie really has any serious aspirations in that direction, but every good movie still has such lessons in there somewhere, so here's my attempt to pull some out:<br /><br />(a) Before harming someone, beware of the possibility of revenge which may far exceed your harm.<br /><br />(b) Ideology can readily drive people to violence which they consider justified, along with willingness to die for a cause.<br /><br />(c) Terrorism can be disproportionately effective, particularly with respect to undermining the morale of the enemy.<br /><br />(d) Occupying a group of people is an inherently dangerous undertaking.<br /><br />(e) People tend to vacillate between allegiance to their personal interest versus the groups to which they belong.<br /><br />(f) History sometimes reaches sensitive points at which outcomes can be drastically changed by seemingly small events.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of Tarantino's previous work, and also recommended to others who want to try something different.ll events.

1400063515|1.0|The book is actually about two black swans: the concept (unpredictable, highly-improbable high-impact event) and the author (Nassim Nicholas Taleb). The first can be explained in 10 pages. The second takes the rest of the book. If you're curious about the author, the book is a good reference (an artist's autobiography, one can say). If you're curious about the concept, virtually any book on the subject should be better than this one.
0784011710|4.0|As I watched this movie, I began to dread every appearance of Kevin Kline. While the existence of his character may have been necessary, the appearance of the character was not. If I had the time and wherewithal, I would create a Klineless version of this film. Perhaps every action of his character could have occurred off screen or be otherwise minimized. The film's editor did us no favor. To watch it again, I will have to mentally edit him out, focusing my attention on Meryl Streep. Her's is the ocean in which you will drown, in euphoria as you watch the light fade away.

B001QOGYBI|4.0|For those who've grown just a wee bit tired of all those \\"family-friendly\\" animated features we've been inundated with over the years, I commend to you \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox,\\" Wes Anderson's sly little creation that, for once, is aimed less at the kids in the audience than at the adults. Not that it is particularly crude or vulgar - it's certainly no \\"Fritz the Cat,\\" and even the swearing is covered-over by the characters uttering a generic \\"cuss\\" - but its themes and dialogue are pitched at a generally higher level of sophistication than we are accustomed to in such works.<br /><br />Based on a book by the beloved Roald Dahl, the story focuses on the dapper Mr. Fox, a recovering chicken thief who, at the behest of his wife, has given up his predatory ways in favor of domestic responsibility as a husband and father and a career as a newspaper columnist. What could be more respectable than that?  But old habits die hard, and Mr. Fox soon discovers he must remain true to his carnivorous nature, leading him to enlist a few of his friends and neighbors of various species in a scheme to raid some local farms and make off with their poultry. This lands him and his buddies in hot water with both the owners of the farms and the heavily armed authorities who are called in to support them.<br /><br />Like Anderson's live-action works, \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" (co-written by Noah Baumbach) owes much of its charm to the scattered, random and quirky nature of the material and its presentation, with a narrative so full of side forays and offbeat, eccentric characters that the movie feels as if it's constantly renewing itself as it's going along. There is wonderful voice work by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe, clever in-joke references to spaghetti westerns and \\"Rebel Without a Cause,\\" a funny subplot involving Fox's son and his obsession with proving his athletic prowess to his inattentive dad, and a simple, clean, streamlined look that combines a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.<br /><br />It may not be a great animated film, but it is one of the more original and refreshing ones we've come across in quite some time.s a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.

0738711500|5.0|I have been reading Tarot cards for many years and have used several different decks.  I came across this deck and book when I was looking for a deck and book set that would benefit a new reader.  While many people suggest starting with the traditional style Rider-Waite, I found the colors dull and the images lacking.  This deck is beautiful and inspiring, and the accompanying book is very well-written and organized in a very thoughtfully-planned way.  The learning method suggested is one of the simplest yet effective plans for learning and interpreting the cards in a realistic and meaningful manner, and is also an excellent way for an experienced reader to re-connect with the cards or to attune to a new or different deck.    This set gets high marks from me and I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in Tarot.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|For those who know the movie: This product is exactly what it says with no tricks or gimmicks.  The DVD works on our very old DVD player.    For those who don't know the movie: You and your children will love this movie.  However, if your children are very young, you might want to see it first.  It's from 1939, when animation wasn't just for kids, and so some parents may find a lot of objectionable material.  For what it's worth, I had this movie memorized by the time I entered pre-school and I don't think I was negatively influenced.  A classic: everyone should see it, and most people should own it.
B002S0OBN2|4.0|I have seen POTO over 200 times so I was very skeptical about a sequel to the show.  I have not seen the show yet because it has not arrived on Broadway yet but I did purchase the Deluxe Edition of Love Never Dies.  Seeing the video of sent by the Really Useful Group with Ramin Karminloo sing \\"Til I Hear You Sing\\" - I knew I had to hear the rest of the CD - so I pre ordered it.  Well I am not disappointed in the smallest way - yes it is different from the original but then I don't really expect the sequel whether the music, story to be identical to the original - it just would take away from the original.  Yes it is not going to be elaborate like the original with the crashing chandelier etc..but none the less I fell in love with the story.  I listened to the music first by itself and then I listened again following along with the libertto and it moved me - there were times were the tears were flowing and if you can effect me that way without even seeing an actual performance of it then you have done a tremendous job.  There has only been 2 other shows that effected me like that.  So you have give this a chance and stop comparing to the original - listen to it with an open mind and heart.  My 20 year old nephew just listened to it and it was just as amazed by the musis and story and told me he will go with me to see the show when it comes to Broadway.  He thought as I did that Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess were amazing. Andrew Lloyd Webber has done it again!!!
B001HN694K|4.0|Mad as a hatter and wildly audacious, this fantastical 2010 adventure turns Lewis Carroll's classic tale of surreal logic displacement on its ear. Who better to translate this story into a female empowerment parable than the master of quirky darkness, director Tim Burton, and his favorite muse Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter? The excesses of Burton's imagination, guided by Linda Woolverton's ([[ASIN:B00003CXB4 The Lion King]]) sharp-tongued screenplay, result in a particularly idiosyncratic adaptation. Yet, as dazzling and sometimes scarifying as the computer-generated images are, the film is not overwhelmed by the visual elements and retains the basic themes of the original stories.<br /><br />Combining elements of [[ASIN:1402725027 Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]] with its sequel, [[ASIN:0543900568 Through the Looking Glass]], the movie begins when a young Alice awakens from a nightmare in which she has visited Wonderland. The obviously precocious child questions her sanity to which her father assures her that it's fine to be \\"bonkers\\", all the best people are. Flash forward several years later, and Alice has become a rebellious nineteen-year-old on her way to a garden party where all the guests are to witness her being engaged to a patronizing fop named Hamish. She hesitates and asks for a moment at which point she chases a rabbit from her earlier dream into a hole. Perpetually shrinking and enlarging, she finds herself in not Wonderland but Underland where she sees all the talking creatures from her dream, but this time, they all question whether she is the real Alice. They all need the Alice of their collective memory, the one who would have no trouble defeating the monstrous Jabberwocky and ending the reign of the evil Red Queen.<br /><br />Once Alice joins the Mad Hatter's party, it becomes clear she is not in a dream of her making, that she is being signaled to make her own way in life and within Underland, ensure that the virtuous White Queen be restored to the throne, even donning Joan of Arc-like armor for the climactic battle scene. Australian actress Mia Wasikowska ([[ASIN:B0030E5NJ6 Amelia]]) makes a terrifically wary Alice whose sense of wonder is tempered by her palpable search for self-confidence. As you would expect, Depp has the showiest role as the Mad Hatter, all leering smiles and electro-shock orange hair, and he makes the most of it despite an incongruous dance solo toward the end. With her head blown up three times its normal size, Helena Bonham Carter has a field day as the decapitation-crazed Red Queen as she barks orders at her lackeys and demands to be pampered with pigs being used as footrests.<br /><br />The rest of the cast make the impressions needed within the dimensions of the story - Stephen Fry as the dapper but cowardly Cheshire Cat; Crispin Glover as the villainous Knave of Hearts tending to the Red Queen's absurd orders; Alan Rickman as the surly, hookah-smoking Caterpillar; and English comedian Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, perhaps the most Disneyesque of the characters conceived here. Only Anne Hathaway disappoints in an arch turn as the White Queen, appearing to channel her [[ASIN:B00006L948 The Princess Diaries]] co-star, Julie Andrews, in accentuated [[ASIN:B001JRB16U Mary Poppins]] mode. All the production values are first-class from Robert Stromberg's wildly varied production design to Dariusz Wolski's rich cinematography and Danny Elfman's bombastic music score. The movie does meander at various points, primarily to establish the next story turn, but fans of Burton's and Depp's work shouldn't be too disappointed.en donning Joan of Arc-like armor for the climactic battle scene.

B000TPZJNE|3.0|This review is about the Vinyl only, not the album \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" The music is a masterpiece and every one should own a copy no matter what type of music you listen too.    I have recently started to collect vinyl because I have friends that go on and on about how much better is sounds that CD's.  So I purchased this record and played it back to back with my CD.  I delayed the record about 10 seconds so I could listen to the CD and then click it to the record.  My CD play has an adjustable volume so I leveled them as close as possible.  So I listened to the first half clicking it back and forth.  I hate to say this to all you vinyl lovers. For about 95 percent of the music is sounded EXACTLY the same, and I mean no different, the drums sound the same, the vocals sound the same, the cymbals, the only difference I could hear was when the clocks chimed at the beginning of Time and they sound BETTER on the CD. Here is the problem, I have heard this album on SACD and I heard things in the music I have never heard from vinyl or compact disc.  To me they are both flawed and do not represent master tapes that well.  All you vinyl lovers really need to check out SACD or other new formats and give these records up.    The cover, posters and stickers are cool.  I collect music and I do like vinyl, but if you just want to listen to the Album buy the CD and same come cash.

B001TIQUSI|4.0|Im not going to review the movie, (i assume that if you are looking at this review you already know something about this Movie).    So, I'm very happy with this product, it's an awesome movie, the T-Shirt it's good, and the DVD it's Great!. Something you have to know is that you're not going to get a High Definition Quality But that's because this movie was made in 1922 and by that time cameras were Primitive, But it looks fine just a little grainy. 3  Things I Love about this DVD are:    1. It has a different and high quality soundtrack (Seriously it's Amazing).    2. It has like 10min more than some other versions.    3. This is the \\"not edited\\" version, For example: The Name of The Vampire is \\"Dracula\\" not \\"Orlok\\"    So, I don't give it 5 stars because it doesn't  have any extras or subtitles (I really do not expect any bonus), and in like 1 or 2 scenes in this DVD the screen cut parts of the words out, but its just like in 2 scenes (and in that 2 scenes you still can read it and understand it)  .    Great product! i really recomend this one!
0060005696|3.0|I liked the book, but it was so tedious!!!!  Schwartz is compelled to repeat himself time and time and time again.  Although I find the concept of Maximizers and Satisficers fascinating and am glad I was introduced to the subject, I felt as though he was hitting me over the head with examples being reiterated repeatedly.  As my English teacher summed it up - it would be a lot better if it were 50 pages long and in my opinion would have covered all the same points in that number of pages as well.  Albeit, it's an easy read.    All in all, I'm glad I read it.  Frankly, his 20-30 YouTube video (see his website) sums up the book perfectly.  I could have saved a lot of hours reading if I had known of the video first!!! (Albeit his lazy attire leaves a lot to be desired - I think he must have just come in from a run and didn't have time to shower before his presentation.  Either that, or he's a satisficer with a low expectations, but being a true satisficer, hasn't spent much time worrying about it). ;>
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|This is a G movie, and I've got a 5 year old and a 2 year old audience, with themes that are clearly not in line with our personal values.  (Yes, my 5 year old asked with concern why the little boy and girl were being left by themselves??)  The animation is beautiful, sure, and I'm glad Disney didn't kill off the parents for once...      Wow, that sounds a bit priggish, but I'm having a hard time verbalizing that I did NOT like this movie, and think it wasn't on target for little ones.    I did like how the sea life was depicted.  And the waves.  I like the music quite a bit.    I did NOT like how the child was the go-between in the grousing between the parents.  I did NOT like when the Sensei let the child leave alone in clearly bad circumstances.  I did NOT like when the parent left the kids alone, driving across flooded roads, etc.  The pacing was odd, and seemed to lurch a bit.  I guess I wish they had suspended reality entirely, than this odd amalgam of normality mixed with high art.  Talking teapots worked better somehow.    Finally, my 5 year old said it was boring.  This from the child that can watch the same movie back to back for 3 days on cross country road trips.    Wish I hadn't bought this on a gamble.  Renting it first would have saved me some money.
0061730327|5.0|Having been to Malawi several times I looked forward to reading this book.  I wished I could have read such a book before my first trip there.  This book gives a real picture of what life is like in Malawi.  I was moved by William's faith in God; his hunger for learning and his desire to better the life of his family.  The portrait of the difficulties faced by the people of Malawi (famine, corrupt gov't, school fees, etc) is certainly moving and personal. It is great reading/disscusion material for anyone. A great book to read and pass along!

Thanks for a great book Maggie Stiefvater!!  ** Another book series you would like if you like this one -- I highly recommend \\"Tiger's Curse\\" and \\"Tiger's Quest\\" by Colleen Houck = also a fantastic read.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Quite possibly \\"The Nun's Story\\" is the best film about organized religion to come out of Hollywood, in the this case a nun in the Roman Catholic Church. It neither proselytizes nor judges; Sister Luke's spiritual journey unwinds as it happened, allowing the audience to form their own conclusions.  This is based on the true-life story of an actual former Belgian nun Marie-Louise Habets, who became friends with author Kathryn Hulme when they were both working together in a charitable organization for displaced persons in the wake of World War II.  Ms. Hulme novelized what Ms. Habets had told her about her life, but the basic facts are true, in the beautifully written best seller \\"The Nun's Story.\\"  Even though, the book had been a blockbuster in sales, and the talented and successful director Fred Zinnemann had bought the screen rights, at first no Hollywood studio would touch it, the rationale being who wants to see a film about how to become a nun?  This changed when Audrey Hepburn, agreed to play Sister Luke, suddenly every studio wanted the property, with Warner Brothers winning the prize.  What a difference having one of the biggest stars in movies on board will do!<br /><br />The film details with compassion and a sense of wonder, the story of Sister Luke, born Gabrielle Van der Mal, the daughter of an eminent surgeon, who is herself gifted in medicine, but mistakes her vocation for the religious order of nursing nuns she joins.  The movie is book ended with her first and last days in the religious life.  In between, we see the rigorous process a young woman used to undergo in the novitiate, the stepping-stones beginning as postulant, then novice, before taking final vows as a professed nun.  This is most likely a time capsule because I don't believe most Roman Catholic orders of nuns these days would go through such a tough, exacting, exhaustive training.  As the Superior General of the order, Reverend Mother Emmanuel (Dame Edith Evans) warns Gabrielle's class of postulants, \\" Dear Children, It is not easy to be a nun...in a way it is a life against nature.\\"  As we view the sometimes-severe, repressive tasks and rules designed to remove the candidates from the outer world into a closer spiritual communion with Christ, we marvel at the sheer courage, strength, discipline and determination of those who complete their novitiate and become professed nuns.  Despite her misgivings that she in not perfected in the Holy Rule of her order, Gabrielle is professed in her vows, and is now rechristened Sister Luke.  Her religious life after her profession, will take her first to a mental sanitarium in her native Belgium, where she is almost killed by a deranged patient.  She realizes her ambition to be sent to the Belgian Congo where she assists in surgery to a brilliant agnostic doctor in a hospital run by her order.  Just prior to the outbreak of World War II, she is sent back to Belgium, for what is supposed to be a temporary stay, but the war interferes, and she is posted to a hospital on the Dutch border for the duration.  The one obstacle that continues from her beginning as a postulant and threads through her religious life is total obedience to what is perceived to be the will of God as exemplified by the Holy Rule of her order.  Ultimately this is to be her fatal flaw in her life as a nun, she cannot blindly obey without question, and this will finally defeat her, and cause her to leave the order but not the Church.<br /><br />No other actress could have portrayed Sister Luke as well as Audrey Hepburn.  She is simply magnificent, not a wrong note is struck.  This performance was the realization of the acting promise shown in her earlier films, it is her finest, truest portrait, in which she becomes an actress of the first rank.  There is no coasting here on her considerable charm, she must deliver the goods; she does and then some.  The Givenchy outfits are replaced by the austere, simple black and white habits in which shelooks just as breathtaking, the inner beauty shining through.  The soul of Sister Luke is illuminated on her countenance through the peaks and valleys that document her religious life; her torturous, heart wrenching inner struggle with her vocation in the last portion of the film is etched in the pain of the dark circled eyes in the thin, wan face.  Both her son Sean Ferrer, and her companion Rob Wolders have said this film holds a special place in their hearts as the character had many similarities to Ms. Hepburn.  Interesting to note how much the actual Marie-Louise Habets and Audrey Hepburn had in common, both Belgian born, both worked for the resistance in World War II, Ms. Habets had nursed Ms. Hepburn through a back injury sustained on her next film, and finally and most importantly both did exemplary charitable work for the African natives.  This breakthrough performance so totally different from anything she'd attempted before should have won Ms. Hepburn her second Oscar, it didn't, although she did receive a nomination and deservedly won her second NY Film Critics Award as Best Actress and a British Academy Award for Best Actress.<br /><br />An ensemble of renowned actresses augment and support her, in addition to Dame Edith Evans as the regal Reverend Mother Emmanuel, there is Dame Peggy Ashcroft as Mother Mathilde, Sister's Luke's superior in the Congo, and in lesser roles Mildred Dunnock, Beatrice Straight, Patricia Collinge, Margaret Phillips, Barbara O'Neil, Ruth White and in a small but harrowing cameo Colleen Dewhurst in her motion picture debut.  Peter Finch gives a vital, forceful performance as Doctor Fortunati, the Congo surgeon, who will not let his fierce admiration for Sister Luke prevent him from trying to make her to face the truth about her fitness to be the nun her order expects her to be.  As Doctor Van der Mal, Sister Luke's father, Dean Jagger brings poignancy and an unspoken yearning in losing this favorite child with her gift for medicine, so like him in many ways, to the convent.<br /><br />Director Fred Zinnemann does an extraordinary job handling a controversial situation the story of a nun leaving the convent with superb tact and delicacy.  He had mentioned in an interview about this film that the struggle of the individual with his conscience was always a subject that continued to attract him, he would continue his cinematic variations on this theme with \\"A Man for All Seasons\\" and \\"Julia\\".  The screenplay by dramatist Robert Anderson, is literate and eloquent, one of the best-realized adaptations of a famous novel, completely capturing it's essence.  Franz Waxman's musical score is powerful and majestic complementing the action on the screen, but appropriately silent in the final absorbing minutes, a first for a Warner's Brothers film!  The cinematographer Franz Planer uses a somber palette of subdued, muted shades for the scenes in Belgium, primarily blacks, whites, grays and pale blues, when the story shifts to Africa, the vivid, blazing, tropical colors bursting onscreen are almost overwhelming to the viewer.  All of these factors blend together perfectly to create a soaring work of film art. What's gratifying to report is that apparently at the time, film audiences DID want to see a film about becoming a nun, since this was the top grossing Warner Brother's film of 1959, and was rewarded with eight Oscar nominations,including Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director and Best Screenplay. After viewing this film, if you haven't already go back and read the original book, it will add to your appreciation.<br /><br />For the final word, let's hear from the woman who inspired it all, Marie-Louise Habets, who made these comments after the third time she had viewed the film. \\"I'm never going to see it again, because if I do I'm going to run right back to the convent...I could just sit there and cry my eyes out, not with regret or anything, but because of the beauty of it.\\"looks just as breathtaking, the inner beauty shining through.

It refers to the important and sometimes critical ways in which checklists are used, especially in a hospital environment.  My takeaway was, the checklist is a critical tool to insure accuracy, consistency and improved execution, no matter the task.  However, you never see one (checklist) in the book.

B002VECM72|5.0|The  \\"blind  side\\" was  written  by  Michael  Lewis, a  financial  journalist. He  came  across  the material  in 2004  when  he was  working  on  a  book  about  the  finances  of  the National  Football league.  He  noticed  that  the left-tackle  position  was  gaining  importance.  Sean  Tuohy  was  his  classmate  in High  school  and  told him  about  Michael  Oher's  position  and  their  adoption story.(they had not  seen each other for 25 years.)  they  are  wealthy  and  are  not  seeking  any  personal  gain  at  all.  They  took  Michael Oher in  and  devoted   much  of  their  time,  energy  and  money  to nurture  him. It  was  really  a  mircale  for  him  to  go  from almost  a  zero  grade point  average to  2.6. (a  grade  needed  to play  division  1  footabll per the  NCAA  requirements)  This movie  was  about  a unique mother-son  relationship.   Sean  Tuohy contributed  much  too,  However,  Michael  Oher did not  trust man  due  to  his  rough  upbringing. In  the book as  well  as the movie,  Leigh Ann  was the  driving  force-as  in real  life-  for helping  Michael Oher  with  his  transformation  for  his  last  two  years   at  Briarcrest  Christian  school.  The  movie  stay true  to  the  book. The book  and  the movie  exposed many  social  ills of    our  society-such  as  falling  school  systems, drug  problems,  parenting  problems  and  the gaps  between  the rich  and poor.  However,  the  focus  of  movie  and the book   are  to  show  that  an american  family  taking  chances  on  a  homeless   teenager  with  open  arms  and  offering  him  a  second  chance  in life.(obviously   hard  for  some one to swallow.)  one  good  example  here:  Collins  Tuohy  dropped  all  her  advanced  placement  class  to   be with  Michael's  mathematics and  English  class  at  their  senior  year. In an  interview, she  stated  she  was  glad  to  do  it  to  help him out. this  example  addressed  the  point  as to why  there  were  few conflicts  in this  movie. Michael  Oher  deserved  much credit  for  his  vision and  excellent coping  life  skills  while he  was  homeless. He  is  an  inspiration  for many  of  us  in tough  times. I  have  seen the movie  precious  too.  The  incest,  child  abuses and  in-equity   are  common  among  american  families.  The  movie blind side  just  exposed  them  and not  went  into  details.  However,  the movie did  show the  true  life  story  of  Michael  for  a  period of  time.  I  recommend  this  movie  to  everyone  who  is  open-minded.
B0034C9CFK|5.0|Alan Jackson's \\"Freight Train\\" is his sixteenth studio album for Arista Records. Fans will be satisfied to learn the album is typical Alan with his beautiful power-ballads and up-tempo numbers. He wrote seven of the twelve tracks, including \\"Big Green Eyes\\", \\"That's Where I Belong\\", and \\"After 17\\". The album's first single, \\"That's The Way It Is\\", has already shot up the charts and is an exceptional track. The song is simple and deals with how God made the earth. Alan's vocals, like on the other tracks, could simply melt better. He's one of those singers that keeps sounding better with age, even being over 50 now. The highlight, however, on the CD is Alan's powerful duet with Lee Ann Womack called \\"'Til The End\\", a remake of the 1977 Vern Gosdin/Janie Fricke hit. Vern passed away last year and including this song on \\"Freight Train\\" is Alan's dedication to him as Gosdin was one of Alan's idols. The duet is breathtaking and is familiar in the old sound of Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton. \\"Freight Train\\" is a must-own and is one of Alan's better CD's in recent memory.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I very much liked this movie.   It is one of the only times I didn't get think Holmes was snotty and and Watson simple.  The chemistry between the actors was great.   I hope a sequel is in the works.
4789009637|5.0|This is without doubt one of the best integrated books available for learning Japanese.  Now if you are expecting to pass the JLPT level 3 (or N4 for the new test), then I feel that GENKI 1 + 2 is sufficient.  However, please keep in mind that there are people that have passed JLPT 2 and cannot even order in a restaurant!  I have finished all of Genki 1 (although I have not memorized all the kanji and vocab), and am able to have a decent conversation with my Japanese friends and write them emails.  If I do not know a word then I look it up in a furigana dictionary.  The Genki series gives you a VERY solid foundation in Japanese.  No, it does not sound natural if you try to speak like they do in the text, but to sound natural, you just take the very formal speech and make it informal.  It will NOT be that difficult since Genki gives you a strong foundation.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  Your foundation is the key.  You can try rosetta stone or pimsleur or whatever, but if you don't understand why or how verbs or adjectives conjugate the way they do, I firmly believe you will be lost.  I would recommend learning Japanese to learn Japanese and not to pass a standardized test.  Can you imagine speaking with somebody that just studied for the SATs and not really how to speak English?  Conversely, there are millions of people whom scored poorly on the SAT but can speak English naturally.  Well, at least they know how to order food in a restaurant :)  My two cents...

B001FB55L2|4.0|One doesn't have to have seen war first hand to know that war can damage the mind as well as the body.  This is certainly the case in \\"Brothers\\" where a veteran from Afghanistan returns home to small town America as damaged goods.<br /><br />The brothers around which the film is based are Sam and Tommy Cahill.  The former is a decorated soldier and the pride of his overbearing father.  Tommy, on the other hand, has just been paroled from gaol for robbery.  For him, his father has little more than contempt.<br /><br />Sam is shot down in a helicopter while on duty in Afghanistan.  He is reported dead.  His wife is shattered.  However, it is here that Tommy steps up by offering his sister-in-law a helping hand.  He is slowly welcomed and his two young nieces come to adore him.  It is at this point hat Sam is found not to be dead.  He had been held captive by militants and dreadfully mistreated.  Effectively, he is a broken man.  His return home is a great challenge.  He simply can't fit in.  He believes his wife and brother to have been having an affair.  His whole life unravels.<br /><br />\\"Brothers\\" is a modern war film in that it deals not with the action of war per se but its consequences.  It does this well.  Too often, war movies seem to focus on little more than good versus bad.  \\"Brothers\\" goes deeper.  It directly addresses the issue of how a veteran returns to his community.<br />It is inevitable that \\"Brothers\\" will be compared with \\"The Hurt Locker\\".  In such a comparison, it comes off second best.  \\"Hurt Locker\\" is a great film.  \\"Brothers\\" is a good film.  Nonetheless, it is well worth seeing as it sheds light on the challenge of coming home but leaving the war behind.
B000BNX4MC|4.0|Sometimes when you turn on a movie from the 1980's you say to yourself, \\"man, I can't believe I used to like this, this SUCKS.\\"  This will NOT happen to you with Ferris Bueller's day off.  Its just as funny as relevant as it ever was, even though its been around for almost a quarter of a century and the lead actor who played a high school senior, Matthew Broderick, is now pushing 50.    Ferris Bueller's day off offers fresh, non-cliched, and timeless humor at a fast pace. There are no lulls in the laughs, the movie goes from one scene to the next with no tedius moments or slow scenes.  You get to see high school seniors ditch school and play an assortment of pranks on the principal.      They have a near perfect day, doing everything from visiting Chicago's finest restaurants and art museums, to joy-riding a fancy sports car without asking the owner.  The movie explores a number of themes that young adults go through as they graduate high school and go on to college (or something else).  This includes, marriage, not seeing friends anymore, breaking away from parents, and ultimately, independence.  Usually great movies, even comedy, have a framework of thematic material.      A young Charlie Sheen makes a brief appearance as a 1980's punk.  The acting is superb.  I like the scene when Ferris Bueller lets a run down looking parking lot attendant take care of the sports car and when he goes into psychoanalysis and explains why his friend will not be successful in marriage.    Check it out, you'll have a good time with this one.

B000KIPT30|5.0|I got this ampflifier for the intent of adding that 2.1-style bass for late night gaming from my PC, and I find the 11 o' clock position on the knob dial seems to be the sweet spot, which will give you the same amount of bass as a good THX 2.1 system (Logitech Z-2300), without hurting your ears.  I use a pair of Sennheiser PC 350s with this, and it REALLY pumps the sound when playing games like Counter-Strike or Unreal Tournament 3.  You will need two different adapters for the plugs, tho, since these use the 1/4\\" jacks, so I made sure to get a 1/4\\" to 1/8\\" cable for the input, and a 1/8\\"-1/4\\" adapter for the Sennheisers.  However, this does seem to do the trick for PC gaming, glad I found a device like this.

B003102JDM|1.0|I'm utterly baffled by the glowing reviews of this film, from seemingly intelligent people.  Can we have been watching the same film?  The film I saw was the cinematic equivalent of a root canal.  15 minutes in I was feeling unengaged, after half an hour I was wondering in frustration: \\"where is this GOING?\\", and after 45 minutes (feeling rather cheated by all the positive reviews) I decided I'd rather write a review of it than finish watching it.  I see from the many other extremely negative reviews that my opinion wouldn't have changed.      Allow me to summarize the plot:  after a ten minute episode about a dybbuk set in a Jewish village in Poland (which was rather creepy and interesting but had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film), the remaining 90 minutes of the film are taken up with Larry, who lives in a banal Jewish suburb in Minneapolis (?) in the 60s, and  is beset by troubles from the people around him.  In response, Larry does..... nothing, and learns nothing.  There's a Sopranos-style ending, and that's it.    Upon further reflection, I've decided that you'd need to be Jewish (or at least, of a religious/mystical mindset), in order to have the deep thoughts that people are apparently having about symbolism, the meaning of life, Judaism, God, etc when they watch this film.  If that's the sort of thing that turns your crank then apparently you'll like this.    For me this was the wrong movie. As an atheist, these themes are completely uninteresting to me, and there's not much else going on here.  The movie is not 1/100th as funny as Lebowski, it's painfully, PAINfully slow, full of very ugly (in all senses of the word) and uninteresting people.  This film is reminiscent of Days of Darkness by Denys Arcand (shlumpy everyman is beset by troubles, not much happens), but in that film, the everyman at least displays human reactions, fights back, learns something about himself, and finds a bit of peace.  In short, it has a \\"story\\", and thus it's a far, far,FAR more watchable film than this mess.     Acting, sets, cinematography are all very good (the actors all convincingly portray repellent and unwatchable people).  With all this talent, it's too bad they didn't make a movie.  I read the New Yorker review of this film which I thought was very good: \\"As a piece of moviemaking craft, A Serious Man is fascinating; in every other way, it's intolerable.\\"

B000Q6GUTI|1.0|Never read the book, but the movie was boring enough. You finally get to some sort of \\"climax\\" in the film, and the main character totally chokes! If there was some intellectual reasoning behind this, it wasn't made clear in the film. If you want intelligent plot lines and intricate conspiracies, you'll probably have better luck just reading the book.     You can't even figure out what the characters are saying half the time. Does Danny Glover have poor lung capacity and need throat surgery? Because I swear there wasn't any sound coming out of his mouth throughout the film. What? What did he just say? Can you hear me now? Nope, can't hear him.    In summary - no action, no satisfaction. Just dudes who like to shoot around here and there, and lots of grocery shopping. The chick was hot though - plus she was half-naked all the way through the film. Anyway, if you want action, go watch \\"Taken\\" starring Liam Neeson.    What?! You can't give 0 out of 5 stars here?? This movie deserves a -1 out of 5.

1439190275|5.0|I bought this book for Kindle originally, but then loved it so much I decided I needed the hard copy in my hands.  Let me start by saying I lost 55lbs by low carbing 4 years ago.  I have gained back 15lbs over the last 4 years and have yoyo dieted back and forth since then, trying to drop that 15 plus another 40 or so.  Reading this book has brought back the simple science that I needed a refresher course on.      When I first started lowcarbing, I was not concerned with fat intake AT ALL.  And I lost 55lbs in 8 months.  Then I got some screwy idea in my head that if I cut my fat intake, and did lowcarb AND lowfat, I could lose even faster!  NOT!  All it did was keep me hungry and unsatisfied.  Reading this new book has really opened my eyes and brought me back to the simple science that is the genius of Dr. Atkins.  You need to eat fat to keep you satisfied.  Also, my labs at that time were excellent.      Another question I had answered was how losing sodium (thanks to all the carbs being cut out, you quit retaining water) can make you feel lightheaded while showering.  Well, that had happened to me and it scared me, and I mistakenly assumed it was low blood sugar.  So, I quit Atkins and started another lowfat/low calorie regimen, which did not work, again!  Knowing now that it's sodium loss, I make sure I get enough salt every day.      I'm not saying that lowcarb is for everyone, but for me, it is awesome.  My family is full of diabetics and I need to be aware of this as I enter middle age.  I have 45lbs to lose, and I am confident that reading this book has gotten me back on the right path.  Good luck!
B00337KM2S|4.0|Ryan Bingham is close to chalking up a mythical 10 million miles on American Airlines when a perky new executive, Natalie, threatens to take the personal touch out of giving employees the boot by turning it into a web-cam experience.  Bingham is a no-nonsense \\"outplacement representative\\" who is close to reaching a major frequent-flyer milestone.  He also finds himself wrestling with a cardboard cut-out of his sister and fiance, which they want him to photograph in front of landmarks around the US.  Not to be thwarted from his \\"magic number,\\" he leads Natalie on a round of outplacements to demonstrate that this is something that can only be done in person.<br /><br />Clooney has become quite comfortable in this type of role, growing ever more attractive with his gray highlights and open smile.  He seems to have met a good match in Vera Farminga (Alex), who similarly has taken on a pleasant \\"weathered\\" look, despite being only 36 years old.  The two play off each other like in a Billy Wilder movie.  Social commentary is kept to a minimum, although Natalie feels the brunt of outplacing persons when they are forced to give Detroit autoworkers the heave-ho.<br /><br />Jason Reitman seems more polished now.  He avoids getting overly sentimental, although there was a point where you thought this movie might go the way of [[ASIN:B0000AOV4I Sleepless in Seattle]].  Ryan manages to hook Alex into going to his sister's wedding with him, which to some extent forces him to re-evaluate his own life.  He seems almost to the point of giving up those swizzle sticks at executive class lounges when this airport romance hits some turbulence and he is forced to accept the cards that have been dealt him.
