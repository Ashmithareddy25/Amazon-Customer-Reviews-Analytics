B000FC0V3E|3.0|First read in high school, this book was puzzling, shocking and had me wondering what the fuss was about; next read in my 40s when I went on a Hemingway kick, it seemed inconsequential compared to \\"The Green Hills of Africa\\" and especially his bullfight treatise \\"Death in the Afternoon\\"(I was attending bullfights in Colombia at the time,intially against my better judgement, became fascinated by the extraordinarily beautiful pageantry and by the courage of the great bulls, movingly described by Hemingway).<br />  This time around, with lots of life experience to draw from, I was struck by a few glorious passages in \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", some of the hastily sketched characters who are much alive, and the incessant, tiresome drinking that was evidently the hallmark of that era. Read it if you are already a Hemingway fan or plan to see the recently mounted play \\"The Select\\" that used the novel as script.
B007YJ8ZRK|4.0|This movie has 3 teen boys gaining super powers and doing stupid things and getting out of control. You could substitute the super powers for drug addiction, wealth, power, etc. The movie shows the dark side of humanity when someone gets out of character and can't handle their life. I definitely recommend the movie. It is very well done.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|There are so many extras that I have not had a chance to dig into the all yet. Loved the blu ray version and the movie. My kids did too!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down!!!!! It was even better than the first one! This def a must read !!!!!
B000KJT8IG|4.0|Love the first three National Lampoons movies this is proberly the worst of them ,but there is still a lot<br />of very funny moments.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The Panther was OK but it wasn't as good as previous novels.  I was expecting to be on the edge of my seat.  I wasn't.  The story was good but not as fast paced as I would have liked.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My son and I both love this paci.  Its so cute plus its easy to find.  I would get all of them if I could
B0015KGWZG|5.0|Excellent book! If you wish to understand why people in your life make decisions or react in ways that you do not understand then this is the book for you. It is also insightful as to why your behaviour may cause others to feel negatively or positively towards you.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|My daughter just loves this toy! Their are all types colors and textures to explore. She loves chewing on the teether and the rings and squeezing the crinkly \\"foot\\" of the giraffe. The entire bottom of the giraffe crinkles too which was a nice surprise. Overall a great product for this age to keep them entertained and happy!
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|What can I say about Iron Maiden that hasn't been said already. They are absolute legends and this is a must buy for any Maiden fan
B00004XONN|1.0|This music is meaningless and has no personality. Its funny how people call it \\"innovative\\" when it is anything but that. The vocals are horrible, and the lyrics are so pretentious drivel that they almost sound painfully like someone trying hard to be intellectual. There's no enjoyment to be had from this music. It does nothing to stir the soul. Its void and vapid. It has not real emotional connection to human hearts. Its made just for the sake of impressing people with something proposed as new and hip. Hipsters may like this piece of garbage, but I find it better to put it in the trash where it belongs.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Unbelievable dangerous missions performed as routine.There can not possibly be better fighting units/personnel - and it is all real! Could not put it down.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie is worth worth watching. Good film not foe young preteens watch movie good movie nice action good movie.
B005ES1EN0|5.0|i usually buy 8 - 8.5 for shoes and boots, this one is at least size 9 for other brands, so you might want to choose half a size down. apart from that, really light and good looking crocs you have there.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|What a haunting, heartbreaking, wonderful story. it sat in my night stand for over a year before I finally read it (reading my kindle instead). what a mistake. I loved it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher and was so excited to read it as I have been a fan of Mitch Albom's since his first book Tuesdays With Morrie\\".  I have read and enjoyed all of his books, some more than others, so I had high hopes and expectations for this one.  The story started off introducing the reader to a caveman who invents \\"time\\" but then is punished by God by being put in a cave while listening to everyone on earth beg for more, less, faster or slower time.  He is then sent to earth on a mission to save the lives of two people.  Where this book began to get a little bit weak for me was in the character development and story lines of these two people, one a teenage girl and the other an older man.  Neither one of these characters were endearing to me, in fact I found them to be somewhat annoying.  I wanted to like them and I really tried to care about each one's plight but ....  Anyways, the end of the book wrapped up a little bit quick for my liking and I felt a bit disappointed.  This has happened before to me when finishing a Mitch Albom book.  But overall I must say that I did like it a lot and would rate it 4 out of 5 stars.  The character of Father Time and his lessons learned were heartfelt and intriguing. If you have read Mitch Albom's prior books, pick this one up, but if you have never read him before, do yourself a favor and read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" instead.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have given this review five stars because I believe that this account of the raid that took down Osama Bin Laden is as accurate and detailed as we will see for many years to come due to the sensitivity and operational security of the subject.  Although the author's name, Mark Owen, is a nom de plume I do believe that he is a retired Navy SEAL and I trust the veracity of his account. As one who has spent a lifetime associated with the Military the writer's style and language idiosyncrasies convince me of his authenticity: I would expect to see certain works and phrases used only by one with significant military experience.  I have read other accounts of the bin Laden raid, both non-fiction and fictional, and they pale by comparison to this work.  The author has provided a unique insight into the mental and physical processes that make the members of our Special Operations Community capable of enduring hardships and executing missions that few of the rest of us could even come close to attempting.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in getting an accurate insight into the bin Laden mission, the life of a U.S. Navy SEAL and Special Operators in general.  The book is an easy read and once started I could barely put it down.
B0001I561E|5.0|Since this title is in the vault....could only find here.  Shipped fast and in good condition as promised.  I'm sure my grand kids will love getting to know princess jasmine now like the rest of the Disney classics.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Donald Fagen deftly--and wryly-- captures an essence of middle aged male angst<br />in this pop gem of a recording. Ironically, it sounds more \\"Steely Dan-esque\\" without<br />ANY input from long time collaborator Walter Becker. This may be my favorite Fagen<br />solo record because at 50--I KNOW what he's talking about! I bought this record for<br />two friends, and lent my CD to a co-worker; who then bought \\"Sunken\\" for her husband's<br />48th birthday.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|An interesting concept but predictable. The outcome is given away when creatures from the swamp attack the men. When they find room full of egg like items that \\"bleed\\" it becomes obvious what they are when you Know who the producer of the film is.<br />jerbash
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Is a wrongly accused prisoner justified in wreaking revenge on the system? What if his accomplice were a felon? Those were the questions that lingered in my mind after reading this rich, well conceived story. The protagonist, if that's the right term for the accused, has a winsome personality; I was rooting for him despite my doubts.<br /><br />The author's description of the US justice system and its witness protection program is lucid and interesting. The characters are very nicely developed. The standard of English is excellent. In sum, this is definitely worth reading.
B00563M11M|4.0|I have grown up with them,so it was great to see some adult humour really appearing to make it a great story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love it its awesome always better marvelous spectacular cant wait for the next one waa its gonna be over soon
B008458O3S|5.0|i got this game as the FAOD and installed it on my kindle fire hd. i really didnt have any expectations for the game. to my surprise, ive enjoyed every second ive played it so far. its the perfect mix of fun and  brain exercise. yes, it does require thought and strategy to advance through the levels.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|This movie looked like it was going to have some potential, with cool visual effects and a different take on the Snow White story line - a little darker and more action filled.  Unfortunately this potential was never reached, with a shakey story line and negligable character development.  Really not worth paying for, but if it is on TV for free sometime, sure, check it out.  Overall I would give it a 2.5/5, but Amazon does not allow half stars... so rounded up to 3 for not being totally crap.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise. It captivated me from start to beginning.The story is very well written. For only $1.50 this book is a must buy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The series is alot like the 50 Shades of Grey series.I am looking forward to the third in the series to come out
B005LAII12|5.0|This is the best comedy of all time. Can't wait to buy the DVD!  The movie was hilarious from the beginning to the end.
141659521X|5.0|I am a big Vince Flynn fan and have read all of the Rapp books along with Term Limits so I will use that for comparison to his other Rapp novels.<br /><br />My perspective is that Vince's Rapp books usually tend to be great reads and build up nicely from the beginning with a story and twists - flipping back and forth from Mitch and the Villain - and then at the end they kind of climax with constant action.<br /><br />This one is a little bit different and definitely more constant action throughout the beginning of the novel - but it still follows that same old pattern which I found to be excellent.<br /><br />Spoiler: A character from one of the old books shows up unexpectedly - adds an awesome twist.  You have to have read the previous Rapp books to know who he/she is.<br /><br />Have fun reading.  It is a must read for any Vince fans.  Awesome job Vince.  Hate that I have to wait till next fall for the next one!
0312576463|1.0|Where to start?  I suppose that I really wish I'd read the user reviews about this book before picking up the audiobook for a long drive.  What torture!  As most people have said, you form no relationship with the characters (other than one of disinterest and dislike), it goes on and on and ON about things you DON'T CARE about, and it seems to be trying to put out a political message, but you're so annoyed by the characters, you can't even be bothered to care about it!  I found myself skipping over anything that involved the \\"mountain trust\\" or population control...soooooooo most of the book that involves Walter.<br /><br />As I mentioned, I listened to it on audiobook.  The narration is alright.  I've listened to some other books read by the same narrator and he uses some of the same voices that he used for other books, so that was a bit confusing.  Lastly... the voice that he uses for Lalitha.  Oh.  My.  Goodness.  I could not STAND it!!!!!! I wanted to rip my ears off anytime she was speaking!<br /><br />Skip this book! I don't know what the critics were thinking!
B007OV9EYG|4.0|And I give it a A+ for not limiting me to ultraviolet . I only buy Blue Ray disks that have ITUNES DIGITAL COPY.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Can`t wait for the next book to come. I loved it! Funny, interesting, romantic, not boring- I recommend it for sure
B001DMJ9VA|5.0|Either you like Rod's music or you don't. Nothing I say here will convince you to buy this if you don'tlike his raspy voice. But, if you do--you're gonna love this just like all his others.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|YOU DON'T NEED REAL MONEY for this game. Everyone who says you need real money to advance in the game is a liar and do not know how to play this game.<br /><br />I'm playing this game since April 2012 and didn'd spent any \\"real\\" money for it. I mastered all \\"Goals\\" (on Android) without any problem or paying \\"real money\\".  There's also no reason to spent \\"real money\\" for buying gems. For what do you need gems? Maybe for some decorations, but there are enough Items without paying gems for them to let your restaurant/bakery look good.<br /><br />To advance in the game, you should know which recipe you cook. There are recipes with many XP to reach higher levels easy and there are recipes where you get much \\"money\\" for selling them.<br /><br />If you think the game is unplayable since the price-doubling, you don't know how to play this game. Even since they doubled the in-game prices the game is easy to master. If you think you earn not enough money or it's \\"impossible\\" to gain levels you don't know how to play this game.<br /><br />4 Stars - because every day the game crashes several times with error message \\"loading the other restaurant failed\\"<br /><br />Leveling up in Restaurant Story is not so easy as in Bakery Story, because you get less XP and less \\"Money\\" for the reciepes.<br /><br />To level up fast:<br />* buy some Grill and prepare Gourmet Hot Dogs for 35XP each hour, T-Bone Steaks will give you 30XP/hour<br />* Sushi Bar: prepare Tuna Nigiri for 28XP/hour<br /><br />To get \\"Money\\"<br />* buy some Oven and prepare Roast Chickens (48 hours) for a profit of 6,33 \\"Money\\" each served portion or prepare Apple Pies for 5,92 \\"Money\\" each served portion.<br />These are the only reciepes to get much money.<br />And: DON'T prepare Stew.

If you cook Stew you'll only get a profit of 3,96 \\"Money\\"/portion.<br /><br />If you don't want to wait 48 hours you can preparesome Cauliflower Casserole (1 hour), but you'll only get a profit of 3,53 \\"Money\\" each served Portion.<br /><br />USE GOOGLE how to play the game!
B00992CF6W|4.0|So I have built 4 worlds and I'm waiting for them to impliment redstone, rails, and other things like iron doors. I heard that is coming with the redstone though. Anyway, I had this since 0.3.0 (yes I got it before it was out on kindle). It was still being tested so there were a few bugs but those were fixed. there is a bug where the spiders rear part is gone. I think it is a little cute but that fact threw me off guard. Also, in the next update for all of the platforms, Mojang should change the dot in redefine back to the cross. you'll see what I'm talking about if you type into youtube &quot;redstone with a Mojangster sethbling&quot; It'll be in part 1 or 2. that's all I have to say about the next update! Hope it comes soon so I can give Mojang 5 stars!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|l look forward to falling asleep each night with these soothing sounds and love how you can customize it. I plan on purchasing the upgrade soon but the free version is great.  I also like that you can set a timer. Again great free app!!
B008518MOW|2.0|I can't believe in this day I can not get a movie to watch on my IPAD. Ultra Violet is good with a quick connection but that's it. I might rent it at red box. But for the price of Blue Rays these days this will not be part of my collection.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Thank you Ken Follett for writing Winter of the World and Fall of Giants.  I have enjoyed both of them and would recommend them as a great read.  I am so looking forward to the 3rd in the Trilogy - I hope it isn't long in coming.<br />On my list is Pillars of the Earth, and I will probably read many more of Ken Follett books.
B004259BMM|5.0|I have literally played this cd every day for the past month. The songs & lyrics just lead one right into the next.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Want to know what it takes to become the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military...<br /><br />Jim DeFelice, in his Excellent autobiography of his life up to and as a sniper is a worthwhile read. One gets a better understanding of the man and the roll of the \\"sniper\\".
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Wanted was a good one but I would expect no less from Mr. Child.  He keeps writing, I'll keep buying.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was a really engaging trilogy.  What I found most remarkable was the lack of black and white issues.  Most young adult fiction (and a lot of adult too) is too easy - \\"this guy is bad, but that one is good\\".  Life isn't that simple, and neither is \\"The Hunger Games\\".
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book had a difficult plot line.  At times it was hard to follow.  The characters did not have the usual reality of a Grisham book.  I have read most of his books.  This was not his best.
B001LM1456|4.0|This was well done. One small part needed fast forwarded because of sexual content but besides that it was pretty good.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|There's no one even close to him when it comes to recording a wide range of music.  Christmas songs were looong overdue!<br />They're all excellent.
B00846REIS|4.0|I love Eva and Gideon relationship. They are good together. Cary is a great bf. Maggie, Corrine and Christopher are too much...
B009329ZF2|1.0|The movie was good but I was unable to view the whole movie as it took forever to download the movie.<br />This was my first movie on the kindle so maybe it was a user problem but I don't think so.<br />My one star does not the reflect the quality of the movie but rather the quality of the kindle
B0052RDHTM|5.0|An engaging read with an interesting, first person perspective on the lead up to WWI.  Realistic characters and detail within an accurate historic context make this a must-read for anyone interested in early 20th Century history.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The twists in this book are fantastic. The first book pales in comparison. I can't wait to finish the series.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Every song on this album captivates and transcends the soul to a higher plane! Turn down the lights, light up the candles and incense and prepare for an F'N journey!<br /><br />A Lot more actual singing than screaming, but still heavier than hell and a masterpiece. How they do they get better with time? I dunno! Definitely a contender for  ALBUM OF THE YEAR!<br /><br />!!!!BEST DEFTONES ALBUM TO DATE!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very useful app zzquil is no use to my eyes I have a terrible case of insomnia n this works each time I turn it on I really recommend to try.....nothing to lose only gain :-)
B0085Z3B2Q|3.0|I ordered the Lorax two pack DVD.  I only received one DVD.  When I called about it, I  was told that there was only one offered.  However, I did not see this.  If I had wanted to order just the one DVD, I could have gotten it cheaper.  I paid a few dollars more to get the two pack and did not receive what I thought I was getting.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|The app is great, all going smoothly. The only negative being that the search function isn't quite as good as the pc version, as there is no ability to refine or search by organisation.
6305428042|5.0|I bought this for Halloween for my kids.  They loved it as much as I did when I was little.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Couldn't wait to finish - great love story! So glad I listened to my girlfriend and decided to read it!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great book ! Can't put it down! Even though the characters are the same, it is a good read. It is like putting on your favorite slippers.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This reminds me of the fun I had playing as a child..addictive. Always waiting for the time period where I earn the most coins - don't want to stop playing.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson Demille, never disappoints me. His character John Corey has incredible humor, which obviously sprouts from the mind of Demille. The story lines are always captivating, and keep me sliding the screen on Kindle.
0375869026|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I teach in a middle school, and I don't think that Auggie's voice could have been portrayed any better.<br /><br />One of my students recommended it, and I was definitely NOT disappointed!<br /><br />I was expecting just another 'oh, poor me, middle school sucks, kids are mean' portrayal of middle school. Instead, this book is a very positive reading experience. There are tough times for Auggie, but he shows such grace and positivity throughout the book that it's hard to be sad about anything.<br /><br />My favorite line... \\"Be kinder than is necessary\\"
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. My loves the &#34;Lorax&#34; book and loves to see the characters play out in the movie!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Everyone should read this and decide how it applies to them. It is easy to read and makes great sense.
B009PEPML4|4.0|I must say right off the top that I am a big GYBE fan. I love this album as much as their others but don't find it to contain one particular song that jumps right out and speaks to me like Dead Flag Blues did. If you like GYBE then this is a great download at a terrific price!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Easy to use. Use sparingly, it's expensive. Don't assume you know what to do. Follow the instructions! Some thermal compounds are impossible to remove. Arctic Silver cleans up with just a bit of isopropanol. It's clean and easy to use!
B0095T3H2U|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. I was surprised at how the film balanced slapstick comedy and a convincing and realistic development of the characters. I won't give it 5 stars because it's not something I will watch over and over again, but it was very sweet and thoughtful.
B009FB3W9G|2.0|First, Barbra sounded amazing!!! All the other performers were great as well... Now the disappointment, the show was edited way too much! It felt rushed and the magic of the night was taken away. They should have kept the introductions and unedited all the performances from the night. Barbra did a beautiful medley of her hits and Make Someone Happy, which was removed for some reason?! A proper release should have been done to celebrate a one of our greatest voices.
B007SPPANM|5.0|This was a great quality DVD, it was clear with no freezes or glitches what so ever. I recommend this DVD lender to anyone.
B008458O3S|5.0|I reaally enjoyed this puzzle. I completed the puzzle 31 hours after the download and got the bonus puzzles. Hope there ia an update soon. Love this puzzle - if you are a spatilal thinker you will enjoy the individual problems even after you solve them.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is pretty entertaining. Makes my slow days go by quick. i like that it has different modes: arcade, zen mode, and classic.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|can't put it down the fastest 900 pages i've ever read. It makes history a reality - true Ken Follett style Beautifully written and powerful.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|This musical did not hold my attention. The performances were great, the story was lousy, and the mix of the two just left me feeling ambivalent.
B00914JWSW|5.0|One of the best collections Barbra has released... From the beautiful first track &#34;Being Good isn't Good Enough&#34; to the stunning &#34;Didn't We&#34; these unreleased tracks were way overdue. I can't wait for Vol. 2 & 3!
B0043UB0BQ|4.0|sex and violence with a story line that keeps you going. great casting.all three seasons were done very well.i havent repeated any words and there are twenty already there
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A great  game .  It is challenging but not too difficult.  Its very interesting and gets increasingly more difficult. Well worth the money.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|love Peter Gabriel and this is his best! 'In Your Eyes' is a personal favorite with a lovely version song by Dianne Reeves on her Bridges album, but still not as moving as when Peter sings it!
B0095R76EW|3.0|The movie has its funny moments but overall is just ok.  2 hrs was way too long, it seemed that midpoint throughout the movie they were trying to extend it for no major reason at all.  I'd say wait till it's $0.99 to rent it, not worth the $4.99 to watch it in HD.
B0090EIILU|3.0|This film made me laugh, but nothing quotable. It was the sort of comedy where in the moment it was brilliant.
0316044695|2.0|the first half of the book is spent telling about SEAL training, that got boring after the first chapter.  when you finally get to the actual combat the author hammers the reader with political screeds a good portion of the time, mostly aimed at liberals and pacifists. then, while not a stylistic issue, claiming to be a Christian, he repeatedly uses Jesus name like a swear word. the soldiers who lost their lives deserved a better remembrance than this.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I started reading Patrica Cornwell when here first book came out, and I've read every one since. There are only one or two that I wasn't just crazy about, but Bone Bed is my new favorite. I was reminded of her earlier writing, and I enjoyed this book so much. I always look forward to her next book, but after reading this one I just can't wait!
B009JZVT70|4.0|It's a little hard to buy Ginnifer Goodwin with a broadsword, but Jennifer Morrison does a great job in this.  Nice to see her get a good role after her excellent work in House MD, one of my favorite shows.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle is a little annoying as Rumplestiltskin, but is great as Mr Gold.  I'm still crying about the crash and burn of Startgate Universe.
B00846REIS|5.0|So much better than 50 shades of gray. But it was too short. Can't for the third books. I read 1 and 2 in 15 hours
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book, hard for me to put down....great characters, easy to follow. Much better than his last few books in my oinion, although I love most of his books! THis one just seemed to hold my attenetion and was really hard for me to put it down.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie tried to jam-pack all of the original TV series into one movie, which didn't work very well. I will say it was entertaining and it made me want to look into the original series, because it looks pretty great (This movie acts as a sort of teaser for the series.)
0552166758|5.0|Excellent.  I await additional books of simular quality based on other discworld characters, in paperback (I'm a reader and not a collector).<br />Interaction between Vetinari and Weatherwax would seem rather prone to pyrotechnics.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Impressive range of literary skills make this one of the most fascinating books ever.  The author develops unique voices for each character which make this a challenging and engaging read.  Not for the reader looking for a simple page turner, but rather someone appreciative of the craft of storytelling.
B00006I53S|5.0|The quality of this lens is amazing for taking pictures in low light with no flash.  I purchased this to replace the lens that came with my T4i and I have no regrets.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Such a great plot. With many twists and turns. A must read for book lovers
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was very interesting and a book that I couldn't put down.<br />I was reading every free minute...I certainly recommend it.
B00125JP1C|4.0|Reluctant hero with a questionable past and a lady of the evening put their lives and unique skills on the line to save a new born baby.  Different plot to say the least.  Dark humor, lots of gun play, fast action, steamy sex scenes, a little kink.  Adults only.  Not for children.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Not gangbusters, but this product is good for a few minutes on a ride or during a break at work. I'm for anything that keeps my mind active without undue stress.  It works for me.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|Great studio versions of the mashups from the film.  Even the solo Anna Kendrick's character sings with cups.  I listen to the riff-off track often.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book I have just read was classical Greg. I just cannot wait till the next book comes out. Greg is probably the greatest at planning, but it never turns out well. The book would be rated an 8 because it wasn't all about the love that Greg was looking for but Jeff corrected it. The love is in the air, and Greg just needs to find it!
B007N8RULO|4.0|Rapid fire version of Spider Solitaire.  No glitches unless you count the addictive quality of the game itself.  Continuous play is a cinch.
0062209078|5.0|At times painful, at times triumphant, Townshend's fame comes deservedly and at a price. I purchased My Generation as a teenager and was riveted from that point forward and was equally riveted in his telling of his life story. Consider the CD biography. It served as a great companion while I drove to work and back. This is genuine and from the artists point of view!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|If you liked the other MI films, you will like this one.  Great stunts, special effects and non stop action.  Twisting plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Lots of fun.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Pretty Little Liars is an amazing series. It gets your attention and you will not want to put it down, it has mystery, drama, and is a thriller. For ages 13-30 this will get your attention and you wont want to miss what happens next. Also the series on TV will also catch your attention and you wont want to miss an episode.
B00493E1GI|5.0|Great movie!!!  It has a certain amount of truth to some of our trials and challenges within, looking for an answer including a spiritual search in hopes of finding ones self.<br />The movie has an incredible cast.  Love Julia Roberts in her role as well as Richard Jenkins.  The film locations, the scenery, just wonderful!<br />I find this movie inspirational as well as entertaining.  Love this movie!
B000MV9026|1.0|Racist.  Sexual innuendo.  Mean-spirited.  IN A KID'S MOVIE!  Glad I bought this movie used and cheap, because it is headed to the dump.  First few minutes of the movie: a comely penguin singing a Prince song.  To children.

B004EI3ON4|4.0|I watched Tron: Legacy recently, during the ungodly hours of the night.  It got me really emotional, so I impulsively bought this soundtrack right after watching it.<br /><br />I realize now that I only listen to a few of the songs.  If I were given the choice to buy this again (given the ability to rationally think), I might stick to buying those few songs I do listen to.<br /><br />Then again, I do love having the complete CD.  Either way, I have it now, so I won't complain.
1444737112|5.0|I saw this book in a bookstore in London just before boarding the plane for our trip home.  Since I did not purchase the book at that time, I ordered it from Amazon when I returned home.  The book is an easy read and I have shared it with several of my friends.  One friend said she is going to order a copy for herself.<br />This book is uplifting because its story is touching.

B006Z9SP3E|4.0|Not as good as the first book, but still a good read.  I would still recommend both books to my friends.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|As always Mr. DeMille writes a good story.  One of my favorite Authors and I look forward to future releases.
0071762345|5.0|This is my first review for any product on Amazon. I am proud to say that I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a better understanding of the social media landscape. This is a perfect book for any business looking to make the jump to social media or may want a better understanding of it. I believe this is also the perfect book for an individual person looking to change careers into social media  (I was in the middle of reading Likeable when I got hired for my Community Manager position) or wants a better understanding of it. I have a much better understanding of social media strategy and know the questions to ask my boss. I look forward to reading Dave's new book and will get my hands on it soon.

B002PNAY9C|5.0|The book was well crafted and the flow of the writing was captivating and pulled you into the story.  The imaginative storyline is a work of art.
0385344333|2.0|If this had been any other author I would have used the rule I use in most books - if you don't grab me in the first 100 pages I stop reading and move on - too many books, too little time.  Given this was Lee Child and Jack Reacher I kept going.<br /><br />I had an audiobook so a previous reviewer's comment about sections being repetitive is amplified.  I love audiobooks but you can't skim through sections that you don't want to read.  Try listening to a Lincoln Rhyme novel where he recaps his board of evidence at the end of each chapter and you will know what I mean.<br /><br />Maybe it was because it was an audiobook and the reader was trying to sound like a man with a broken nose but Reacher came across as really pitiable.  Jack''s long time habit of buying new clothes every 3 days along with the broken nose effects sounded really pathetic.  He sounded more like a homeless bum than the hero he has been to all of us over the years.<br /><br />Glad I got a from the library and didn't buy it.

B0032Y0OH0|5.0|This device is just what I needed for use with Adobe Premiere Pro (I'm using CS5). I also use it with After Effects, but to a lesser extent. I haven't tried other units, just this one and it does what I need it to. Highly recommended if you currently edit with just a keyboard & mouse.

B007QPFGJW|3.0|I have read all the Nesbo books that have been translated, and this is probably my least favorite.  I didn't find it as suspenseful or historically educating as his other novels.  Many of his earlier novels give fascinating insights into the historical background of Norway in WW2 or nordic character and culture.  This was not true of this novel.  In fact, I can't even remember much of the plot although I read this book just 2 or 3 weeks ago.  However, if you haven't read any of the other Nesbo books, you will probably enjoy this, since you won't be comparing this to his other work.  In all his books, Nesbo is a skilled writer, educating the reader while taking her/him through engrossing and twisting plots.  I look forward to reading other reviews of this book by Nesbo fans, since I don't know if I am being unduly harsh.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|With the exception of one or two songs i did NOT like, this is an epic musical, and definitely worth seeing at least once.  The music is majestic, emotional and gripping, and the story themes are timeless.  Definitely the best cast I've heard.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have this app installed on my tablet and liked it so much I added it to my phone for the times I don't have the tablet with me. I would reccomend this to anyone who likes puzzles. Some are very easy and the larger ones can be quite challenging.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I have read two others of Gillian Flynn's novels, and had high expectations for this one.  The story idea was captivating and I enjoyed reading the novel, but the ending left me wanting more.  It ended with no resolution.  If I wanted to dream up endings to books I read, I would write my own!
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This series is NOT for an immature audience. It is dark and graphic and goes where many other shows will not. This show will creep you out mentally, physically, sexually, and you will love every minute of it. Its a masterpiece of horror.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Just a delightful story.  There's hope for all of us.  I love her feistiness and her good looks will always be remembered.

0553801503|4.0|Though this isn't the best of the series it's still a really great book and i found myself still loving the characters and situations that they were put in and can't wait to see what happens next.  As another reviewer put it \\"this is the calm before the storm\\". Though it doesn't have much action i'm so enthralled by the author's wonderful writing style and this amazing world that he has created.  Still worth a good read :-)
B0047CPB42|5.0|I saw the movie about a year ago and loved it, just got around to reading the book. Couldn't stop reading, even when I knew what was going to happen. The story really draws you in, its exciting and keeps you on edge.<br />A must read. If you haven't seen the movie yet read the book first! But if you have seen the movie you should still really read this.
B0053FANS6|5.0|All three movies that you know and love from the Mummy franchise all in one nice and neat package. The only thing that would make it better is if it included the Scorpion King.
6305428042|5.0|I've been waiting years to get this movie at a discount.  It's the most delightful, fun Halloween film for all ages.  These ladies can do no wrong anywhere.  Loved the music too.
1576875776|5.0|Vivian Maier's work discovery is an amazing story. She is a photographer to discover. Every picture in this book is great! Beautiful black and white work. Good sense of humour on some pictures, good sense of geometric composition on others. A great street photographer.
B008PWUYVA|4.0|Velcro is used to secure the Kindle inside the case, as well as opening the case; it's definitely not going anywhere or fall out easily. However, if you hate dealing with Velcro, then this case isn't for you.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Multi-angle viewing thanks to the \\"gecko\\" grip<br />- Black cloth frames gives it a different viewing experience<br />- Easier to distinguish the orientation because the headphone/volume cut-out<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Dust can get stuck on their patented \\"TEGS micro finger grip\\"<br />- Not the prettiest looking case - not slim (but gives better protection). It definitely doesn't have a sleek look; it's like a heavy jacket.<br /><br />If you prefer looks over functionality, then this isn't for you. However, if you need a case that will protect and give you better viewing angles while laying down or sitting on a desk, this is for you.
B0078XHAB4|5.0|Enjoyed this book so much couldn't put it down, such a lovely story with a happy ending, didn't want it too finish, along with other books I have read would like a sequel.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I loved it. It was a great game to play. It was so much fun. It was very challenging. It was better than the first one.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|We are still not through all the different episodes, but it doeshold your interest pretty well.  A good Series to watch.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|I've been collecting all the LotR sets (or at least enough to get the fellowship). This one wasn't too exciting from the box images.<br /><br />But after building it, I think it might be my favorite. The internal details, and clever tricks of putting this set together don't come across on the box. It's a fun set with more interesting building details than many of the other LotR sets. Some of the figures aren't as interesting, but lots of cool pieces, and all-around, a lot of fun, this guy.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Why can't this be for the first gen fire kindle? I refuse to pay for this when other tablets are getting it for free. Its un fair. I almost want to sell my kindle due to many apps not being unfairly charged because I have an original fire.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|Its frustrating that everytime my daughter opens this app it restarts her. Even after I have paid money to purchase more points so she can build a team of enough employees to keep up with all the quests.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a good read.  Some was pretty graphic, but overall I enjoyed reading it. Will be interesting to see how the movie is adapted and whether it stays true to form.
098478280X|5.0|I was recommended to purchase this book as I was applying for Software Engineering positions - some at small consulting firms and others at larger organizations. It had been a few years, since I interviewed or took any programming/software engineering classes, so I definitely needed practice. I practiced the problems in this book daily -- it really helped to train my brain how to think about the interview questions -- especially the puzzle-like questions. Overall, I think this is a great book for any software engineer, whether you are looking for a job or not. While a lot of books and Internet resources have the same questions and answers, this book really digs into databases, data structures and design patterns, amongst other things.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Always wanted to add this to my library. Arrived sooner than expected.  Great condition.  Movie is very good, the first Time Machine movie is the best though. Very satisfied.
B006WM2FFS|5.0|This movie contains so much action. It also has the best background music and scenery. The movie 's theme about the importance of a country's unity over individual ideas was very compelling. Overall this movie is very entertaining.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Good graphics and sound.  Challenges you to think multi-dimensionally and instinctively work the controls without taking your eyes off of the runway.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Omb I love this game I have been playing for a week. I am a freshmen in highschool and all the work has got me stressed out I totally recomemd this game for anyone who wants a bit of stress relief. ;)
B004Y8075M|5.0|This book is great for adults and youth. It really takes just a night to read...at least...I couldn't put it down, but a lifetime to ponder. Whenever people talk about what \\"paradise\\" or the afterlife looks like they speak of perfection, but what does that really look like? This book gives an eerie picture that sticks.<br /><br />Lowry walks his audience through the life one boy, who is chosen to learn the secrets of a life his ancestors, chose to leave behind. At first, the world sounded like a place I wish I could live in--children were always provided for, everyone gets along and does their duty or...(this is where Lowry does the psychological shift)...is disposed of. Then the reader is left to ponder how a world so beautiful could be tainted by ritual murders of infants, teens, and adults alike. Then the exposé begins to occur. There is also no love-making, love, or joy because those come with pain and sorrow which the society was created to destroy.<br /><br />In the end, the reader is left wondering whether one should try to escape such a perfect world or try to fit in to avoid the tragic ending...or was it tragic? It is left up to the reader to decide. Which is more tragic--life where sin exists but also joy or life without either?<br /><br />Which would you choose?
B008TTPQXA|4.0|I worked as a nurse for 25 years and saw death at first hand and can relate to the scientific explanations of NDE'S. However I have experienced things that I have been unable to explain and found this book convincing and comforting,having dealt with personal loss in my life. I have talked with colleagues both doctors and nurses about what I have seen,but the 'rational' explanation always prevails. This book gives another viewpoint and I would recommend an open mind before attempting to read it.@
B0000AQS0F|2.0|I bought this thinking it was region free and when it came it was region 1. Very disappointed indeed. Not happy
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A good follow up to the first.  Learner a lot more about the charters and enjoyed them.  Can not wait until the third book to see what comes next.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I can't put this book down. It's extremely captivating. Better than &#34;Clash of Titans&#34;. It's off to a slow start at first, but then gets much much better.
0486278077|5.0|This book was so well written and covers so many important, seemingly timeless dilemmas that I felt guilty while I was reading it. Even though there is  no explicit language, there was a subtle sexual undertone throughout the work that was frightening. It is one of those books that people love to hate and hate to love because it hits so close to home for people in so many walks of life. I think the reason it can touch so many people is because it makes people wonder about how well their friends would think they are doing rather than how well they themselves think they are doing. \\"What would I look like if the mirror were to show my 'inner' self rather than my 'outer' self?\\" is the pervasive question here.
B003KK65KG|5.0|This is one of Jodie Picoult's best.  I love the way she takes what could be a contentious issue (or two) and makes a brilliant statement through it via fiction.  Love it.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|In all my years of reviewing albums, it's rare to find a band as popular as Aerosmith (that uses professional songwriters, nonetheless) that has now released two out of their last three original studio albums that have a good, strong vibe overall, but very poor singles.<br /><br />In a way, the album is similar to \\"Nine Lives\\" because there are really no killer singles, and no terrible tracks, just a solid but unspectacular rock album. There are faint attempts by the band to return to their old sound of the 1970's, but again, the songs don't have great hooks, so they sound good while they are playing but don't stick with you like their classic stuff does. Sure, there are a few songs with partial hooks (\\"Luv XXX\\" sounds like it could have been taken off of \\"Get A Grip\\" and \\"Could've Been Love\\" sounds like the b-side to \\"Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\\") but these highlights don't match the heights of their previous work. Given the fact that this album took eleven years to make, the songwriting really should have been better. But even the songwriters they have used (Marti Fredrickson, Desmond Child, etc) are older and pretty much tapped out of good songs. But the whole idea of \\"album rock\\" is to make an album that rocks, and in that regard, this album accomplishes that.<br /><br />Steven Tyler sounds old and worn out, but by the same token he sounds amazing for being 64. At least in the studio, he can still hit the notes that matter, when they matter. So overall, this is an album by a legendary band that certainly will not taint their legacy in any way. It's quite a good listen. But no song in particular is up there with their best work, so it won't add anything to the legacy, either.
B001NLKS16|4.0|This journal gave us fans a bit more insight into John's mind,and reasons for his actions. Don't get me wrong, he comes across as an ass at times,but all in all I enjoyed it. Those superfans will recognise holes,but they are pretty easily overlooked as Bobby explains more in his Guide to the Hunt. i really enjoyed the journey John went on and his pain of taking dean and Sam along for the ride.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I'm not easily pleased by just any old release and I don't buy off on classic rockers who pump out lame stuff and rest on their laurels, but this cd was a very pleasant surprise.<br />I can only laugh at the negative reviews I've read here on Amazon; I can't imagine what kind of criteria they are using to judge this cd. Evidently some people are stuck in the past wanting 1970's Aerosmith, or maybe they are hooked on today's disposable and irrelevant music sounds?<br />This new cd, from classic rockers who are still touring rockers over 60 y/old, absolutely delivers! Don't over-analyze it, just enjoy it, it rocks! If you have been a fan of Aerosmith since the old days, you should love this cd! If you fancy yourself an \\"intellectual rock music critic\\" or are into headbanging noise, yeah, maybe should skip it, lmao.<br />As many Aerosmith fans have been reporting, this cd just keeps getting better every time I listen to it!
B007VYDFMS|5.0|What a wonderful documentary! This is one of the most honest depictions of a public figure that I have ever witnessed. It not only highlights his awesome talent, but also his shortcomings; those extra bits that re-assure all his avid followers that he was merely a human being - just like the rest of us.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007VYDFMS Marley]]
B001ECQ75A|2.0|This movie is the best but I was disappointed when I received the DVD because the listing says &#34;widescreen&#34; but the DVD I got was full screen. People, when you're listing a product and you're not sure of its specs, ASK SOMEONE!
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|I bought the Amazon MP3 version **not the physical CD**. The Amazon MP3 version INCLUDES ALL 23 songs from Born to Die and Paradise (including Lolita,Without You, and Lucky Ones). I preferred the mp3 version so I can have it on my Kindle/phone/laptop/cloud/etc.<br />...and Lana Del Rey is awesome
1936608898|2.0|I didn't like the organization or the writing style of the book. The authors speak like teenagers talking down to five year olds. The book recommends a very extreme diet.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its a very good game if you like samurais and zombies very fun you can be zombie or human some zombies are really dumb tho they jump around like fool FOOLS I SAY.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|It may be Bob Dylan's last, but it's one of his best albums.  I have enjoyed it driving to LA and back.
1452101248|5.0|Hands down the most inviting, inventive yet not too tricky vegetarian cook book on the market. Have made nearly half the dishes already and all were delicious and not too challenging. A must buy for any food enthusiast!
B009E2WX3W|3.0|It was OK, I already listened So more than 20 years ago... I purchased it because it was cheap and I never got music from amazon. Thanks.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|At first I had some problems trying to decide why I should stay with this book.  It didn't appear to have any relevance to my life, but as I read more of the book I realized what a profound impact this book could have on our perception of life and death.  Definitely worth reading.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Not the usual Diana Krall. No where near what I was expecting. Not jazz. I've already dumped it on the used market.<br />Sorry but I've got all your other albums and this was not your best!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I am a big Daria fan and this collection have so much value for the money. Excellent case with sturdy dvd holders. Music is not the original one but the replacement music is ok. I am grateful for this collection and I totally recommend it.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|Have tried this several times and have been unable to get it to work using it at work and at home but so far no luck....
B009FZFONO|5.0|The second season was really not so good, it was really annoying, especially some of the characters. But this third season is fantastic so far! A lot happens, really keeps you on your feet. I recommend it, and if you're just starting the show, just sit through the second season. It'll pay off.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|For me ,personally, I really liked Audio Secrecy (especially the three bonus traks), just like me Come What (ever) May and continue with this work in the same musical line. If we judge this cd for the first five songs, for me is his best album (Tired is for me the best song from Stone Sour) but it is possible that the album down a bit the high level at the end. The worst song, always in my humble opinion is Last of the Real which is the last of the cd but overall a very good job. Highlight the string section on some songs that give a different color to these compositions Now we wait a worthy continuation. Surely not disappoint us.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Amazon was great, as usual, with getting this product to me. I now buy almost everything from Amazon. But the book is such a let-down. I was expecting the same talent shown in Harry Potter series, but all she is doing is trying to make up for lost time with foul language and vulgarity. I am about 30% into the book and still haven't discovered the plot.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Every week I watch this show it gets creepier and more twisted. My husband has now gotten sucked into it. Personally, I love it, although I question if I want to watch it. I get sucked in every time!
B00932A2MC|5.0|I was really turned off when I heard Rhianna was acting in it. But I have to say the movie was great and she did a great job. Really awesome movie!
B004HW7JHE|5.0|The writing on this show has crackled since the pilot episode of season one and hasn't let up.  Unexpected things happen, just as they do in life.  And 'Mad Men' captures the mid-'60s flawlessly.  I lived through that era, and watching this show is like a time machine.  The acting is brilliant, the dialogue is piercing(and sometimes uncomfortable, which is the show's strength)and the sets, costumes, makeup and props dead-on.  I can't wait for season six, to first watch on AMC and then to buy.  When there are no more episodes of this show being produced, I'll feel like I lost a friend.  'Mad Men' works on so many levels....you can watch each season and episode multiple times and get something new each viewing.  How many TV shows can you say that about?<br />Weiner and company continue to amaze.  Every season is a home-run.
0345803485|2.0|The way everyone was acting I expected more from the book. I mean don't get me wrong it was good reading, but not the way people were taking it off the sale shelves. They said it was like renting porn. I think not. I will however go on to the next book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is simply amazing. I love the way the author tells the story and the way it is inlaid. If you are interested in fantasy at all along with a great view of old lore then this book is for you!!! Can't wait to start reading the next book which I am downloading now!!!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I've seen better movies, but Johnnie Depo is fantastic in his role and so are the other characters. I wouldn't watch it again, but for one evening it was entertaining enough!
B0090EJ99A|4.0|I've always loved comedies. SBC has always ha that type of quirky humor I could relate to. This is a definite watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm slowly reviewing each of the stories but this edition is a great value. Even if you purchased them seperately it would be a great value. Read the first one for free then get ready to buy this bundle. The stories are well written, exciting and keep you coming back. 5 stars all the way.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|This is a favorite album of mine.  Bruno Mars is a great artist and his songs do communicate.  Many of them are quite different, so give it a shot.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|It's very different from the book, really shortened down. At some parts I wish we could have gotten more insights, but it's a good, entertaining movie. The Lincoln actor was great!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I recommend this book to women and men... men especially you might learn a thing or two on how to really make your relationship more intense and satisfying your partner. This book should be read by all adult women... for those who snub this book I'm sure your sexual experience could use a pick me up! How erotic! I'm going on to the next book!
B004QSQML8|5.0|I grew up to this movie back in the late 80's. This is an absolute classic I had to have in my collection. I couldn't find it anywhere in the stores, so I tried looking on Amazon, and BOOM!!! There it was. I love the quality, and it brings back so many memories. Reasonably priced item that I couldn't resist.
B0048IMZMG|4.0|This is Taylor Swift when she is more country than pop, yet I like it even though I'm not much of a country fan.  I know, try to make sense out of that!  Swift sings what she feels, so there is a lot anyone can relate to.
B000002B30|3.0|BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN-GREATEST HITS: The Garden State's answer to BOB DYLAN held off longer than most artists (over twenty years) before issuing a &#34;best of&#34; compilation, which is commendable...his most rabid fans coveted all his original albums anyway. Unfortunately, GREATEST HITS ignores The Boss' first two platters completely, opening with his everything-but-the-kitchen-sink breakthrough BORN TO RUN. Just one track from DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN appears here...thankfully, it's BADLANDS, with its rich lyrical imagery, raggedly perfect guitar solo, and wailing CLARENCE CLEMONS sax break...in short, all the trademark elements of classic SPRINGSTEEN. Not surprisingly, BORN IN THE U.S.A. is represented by four solid tracks, but the remainder of this sampler is given over to lesser fare...several so-so new tracks from a reunited E STREET BAND, at the expense of genuine showstoppers like SPIRIT IN THE NIGHT, ROSALITA, PROMISED LAND and famed B-side PINK CADILLAC. The triple play ESSENTIAL SPRINGSTEEN is a much more thorough examination of the &#34;Glory Days&#34;, racking up almost every important hit, cult classic and rarity....something GREATEST HITS barely hints at.<br /><br />RATING: THREE FIVE O'CLOCK SHADOWS
B000VWYNOG|5.0|This was an awesome CD. This combination of songs was absolutely what I believe in. Van Morrison is still a great singer and song writer. It's hard to believe that I just became acquainted with his music. We (my husband and I) listen to this CD probably three or four times a week. We love it!! Amazon is a perfect way to get the music you want, fast and often<br />cheaper than anywhere else. Love ordering from you!
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Life time player of amature chess and never learned (\\"learned\\") the game, but I like to play, so this program does it all with low permissions, functions well on my Samsung Galaxy SII. Thanks dev and Amazon FAOTD.
B000OSDSKM|5.0|Outstanding. This film holds up and is as timely today as ever. If you love movies, then you must see this one.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. In 3d you can see the difference in the fore and back grounds. Even if nothing jumped off the screen like in other 3d movies, the depths is what made the difference. I hope that 3d for home really takes off.
B005CRQ4AG|5.0|Wir besitzen alle Harry Potter - Bücher und doch wollte ich es mal als eBook zu lesen versuchen. Natürlich ist es nicht mit einem Buch, das man direkt in der Hand hat, vergleichbar, aber auf dem Kindle doch recht gut zu lesen. Was “ kostenlose Kindle-Leihbücherei angeht, werde ich das Angebot weiterhin nutzen, aber auf keinen Fall auf echte Bücher verzichten.
B0068FYZCA|5.0|I bought this soundtrack and fire it up when I am working out on my home rowing machine.  It makes the time fly... and the Wolfman Jack stuff is great as well. I loved the movie and this CD is just awesome.
1401937268|5.0|These cards are amazing. Doreen Virtue's Cards are all great! I love getting her cards on Amazon because they are a good price!
B00846REIS|4.0|Post \\"50\\"... I was searching for something comparable. After reading a couple of duds... I read a review and then the sneak peek of the book...I was hooked!!!<br />OMG...Gideon is smoldering hot!!! Gideon and Eva are a great couple. Instead of one that's \\"50 shades of F'd up\\", you have 2.<br />You will transition quickly to  \\"Reflected in You\\"
B003WUYRGI|5.0|A tome of excellence. If it was followed by a thesaurus of equal standing it would save much shelf space.
B005PK553C|5.0|I absolutely love this show! It's spooky, sexy, intriguing, interesting, captivating and addicting! I was hooked immediately and became an instant fan. I look forward to watching many more seasons...
B0042816YK|3.0|Product was scratched and skipped but after cleaning it worked and I was able to  view and enjoy the DVD.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I felt that the product was delivered in perfect condition. It was had come with enough special features to keep me busy for weeks.
1421550644|5.0|I'll keep my review short:  This print is one of the nicest (graphic) novels that I've ever laid my hands on.  The slipcase, binding, paper and inserts are of the highest quality.  As for the story itself, I must first admit that I'm not a comic or manga guru.  That said, if you have even the slightest interest in the genre, then you'll find that Nausicaä is a pretty safe bet.  Be warned though, as others have said, this story is quite intricate with multiple characters and plot-lines.  Not needlessly convoluted, mind you, just intricate.  Nonetheless, your time (and money) spent with Nausicaä will not have been wasted.
B008NEMN0K|2.0|A rip-off from Fox.  First, all should know that the 3D version of the film has been CROPPED!  The widescreen film therefore loses picture information...which is reprehensible considering that this is a visual-effects film.  The 3D conversion is just \\"meh\\" as well.  While I'd give the film at least 3 stars, the hatchet job done to the movie by Fox makes it a must to avoid.
1451696191|5.0|I have read this book at two very different times in my life and it changed both times I read it.  When I was younger I read this book and felt like I could relate to the characters so much just being in the unsure place about what you do next in your life and this book drives home the fact that that is okay.  It is okay to now know who you are or what you want in this life.  This book is written in a series of letters to the reader and even that takes on a different tone based on where you are.  It is a very honest book about Charlie starting high school and dreading every moment of it.  It doesn't pull any punches and you by the end you feel like you know the characters so well from Charlie's eyes.  It is gripping and there are moments that you will find your self trapped inside this world waiting to figure out what will happen next.  At the end when everything comes together it is gripping.  It is a book that stays with you when you close you and one that you remember and want to tell everyone to read when they are in a transition in their lives!
B004HMNQQM|4.0|I have seen this movie before and I love it! I could not find it on Netflix, but then it popped up on Amazon, so I ordered it!<br />I like Richard Gere - he and Jodie Foster make a good team in this movie.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Love legos! This purchase was for one of my grandsons. I can't wait to see his eyes when he see's it. Surprised at it being hard to get ahold of already. I'm sure it will be a hit.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I originally bought this thinking it would be at my parents house for my sister's xmas gift sooner than Christmas Eve, but I found that it may not be. The seller went out of their way to express it to me without additional cost. My sister was happy, I was happy, and the seller saved Christmas Morning! Definitely would do business again. Oh, and I definitely cant complain since this was roughly HALF OFF the original price in the stores! YUP!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Thia book was an easy read and it kept my attention the entire time.  Engaging in this entire series was well worth while.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing Prometheus because i heard it was a pre-quel to the movie Alien. On the front of the box it says \\"Questions will be answered!\\". Well after watching the film all i could say was \\"what the heck just happened?\\" Almost all of my questions about the genesis of the Alien were left unanswered and the film just made me have more questions then before i saw it. What i took away from Prometheus was that the Alien is a mutated biological/geneoligical weapon of some sort created by the \\"Engineers\\"(as they are called in the film)which are the race of alien that piloted the spaceship in the film Alien. At the end of the film you see a creature that looks somewhat like the aliens from the other films. But how this Alien came to be is a bit strange and makes no sense to me. If you watch the film i believe you'll say the same thing. All in all the rest of the film was boring. Even if you don't associate this film with the Alien franchise, none of the major plot points in the film came to a conclusion.<br /><br />  I don't know what Ridley Scott was thinking when he made this film and I don't understand what the writers were trying to accomplish either. It felt like an incomplete movie to me. I'm really disapponted that Scotts name is attached to this film because i really enjoyed many of his other films. If somebody is dumb enough to make a sequel to this film (it was set up for it) i hope they write a better story and execute it better. If you read this and haven't seen the film....do not purchase it. Rent it first. Have a nice Day!!:)
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I hope that they continue the series. There is a certain chemistry between the actors that makes it more fun.
1594135851|5.0|A must for the Hunger games fan, as the story takes on a whole new dimension and leaves you needing to get MockingJay !
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Another Dream Theater CD. Not much else needs to be said. I knew of Dream Theater, but I really hadn't been exposed to the right things until a year or so ago. I've really missed out. This isn't my favorite, but it's a strong CD and recommended for any fan.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Some of Grisham's latest work hasn't been up to the level I know he can write at. Well this one got back to where I expect his books to be. Wove an incredible story and unfolded it beautifully right up to the end. Highly recommend this. Still waiting for one that matches A Time to Kill though.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Best \\"Hard Rock\\" album this year.<br /><br />Soundgarden have come back just as strong as the left. Similar to Alice In Chains last album it grows with every listen. At first listen I found myself questioning song by song asking why the did this. Yet by the 3rd listen i was hooked. Some seriously amazing bass lines by Ben, great shredding by Kim, Matt as always pounding out some odd timed beats, and Chris as his best.<br /><br />Best track for me has to be Worse Dream, followed by Eyelids Mouth. The end of the album is better then the start. Odd but it leaves you wanting more.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Love it, buy it . Add it to your collection especially with the snow days ahead in Minnesota.  Great to watch with a bowl of soup.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|5 episodes in and this is a mentally challenging and visually stunning season. It challenges moral decisions and builds characters that have never been on TV before. This is a classic show worthy of watching. Note that it is not for the faint of heart and for people who can handle some gore and violence.<br />Worth all the violence for the brilliance of the writing and the depth of each character.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|I had never seen this movie until recently.  I noticed it had the unfortunate timing of coming out in 1997...year of the Titanic and overshadowed by other blockbusters.  Truly unfortunate because I was absolutely riveted from start to finish even though the run-time is longer than most movies today.  Kevin Spacey was just absolutely great...there is a scene where in about a span of two minutes, he demonstrates what an incredible actor he is.  Russell Crowe, I had no idea he could be more than just a \\"hunk\\" like character but his Bud showed that he was something more than an emotionally damaged thug.  Guy Pierce was really terrific as the straitlaced cop who delves into murkier waters and we wonder whether the bright eyed young man will just be one of the fish that gets swallowed up or emerge as a shark.  All three of them really owned their roles.<br /><br />The only one I thought was the weakest was Kim Basinger to be honest.  Perhaps her script was just not as good or something.  I am not sure but it surprised me that she won the Oscar for that year. I thought her character could have been much more compelling as the one whose motive is not quite certain (does she really care or does she have a hidden motive as well?)<br /><br />Anyway it may not have been the most lucrative movie for these guys but I would rank it as one of their finest works.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|If you haven't realized by now Crystal Castles are not satisfied with making the same album over and over again, then maybe you shouldn't listen. If you get what Crystal Castles are all about then this is another amazing album.<br /><br />III takes the overall dark feel of II and expands on it, wallows in it and celebrates it. I feel like I am listening to the soundtrack to someone's beautifully haunting dream. Like the last album it wasn't what I was expecting, but like the last album it gets better with every listen. In some ways III reminds me of their first album, it's a little more raw and many of the sounds have a vintage feel due to Ethan using analog equipment. The only problem I have with the album is overt use of reverb on Alice's vocals, it get a little monotonous after awhile. Like the last album, it leaves some of the old CC behind and picks up something new. The greatest asset to the album is the melody and hooks buried beneath the atmosphere. I feel like I'm in a room filled with fog trying to find my way through and that really sums up how I feel about this album. Everything I love about CC is here and that's really all i need.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  I enjoy the series good clean tv for a change.  I laugh a lot watching it each episode .
B001EU79F4|5.0|This album is a perfect way to dip your toe into the pool of Waits' creations.  Listen to some of his later stuff first and it's a more awkward and coarse introduction.  Closing Time gives you some beautiful sentimental ballads as well as some musical 'c'mons' before Waits' voice got that trademark whiskey soaked growl to it.  Perfect musical nudge to give someone who says they hope they don't fall in love with Tom.  Then step back and say 'Opps' when it happens.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this Game is really good. I think it is the best that I have on my kindle. I woruld recomade it to everybody. like my friend kens._
B00633W614|5.0|This master storyteller keeps your interest and leaves you hungry for more.  My favorite author.  If you are new to Jeffrey Archer go back and read &#34;First Among Equals&#34;, &#34;&#34; Kane and Abel&#34; , and the others.  Have not read the short story collections because I like getting lost in a book.  His works do it!
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Horrible movie. Worst movie rental decission I have ever made on Amazon Movies.  Please don't waste your time or money.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I love reading this series. I love watching it on HBO even more. The story is excellent. Martin gives the story depth and there is no shortage of detail. It's easy to become invested in the main characters but almost impossible to keep track of the secondary characters. Martin does provide the genealogy of the various houses but it's confusing to read so I skip over it. What I like most about this series is that Martin isn't afraid to put the main characters in harm's way. I'm only about half way through with this book but I have been assured by friends that have read it that there will be surprises along the way. I think my favorite character is Daenerys. I want to see her succeed and win her way to the throne.<br /><br />Main point: Great story, easy to get into, but by no means a quick read.
0345529057|3.0|I think i will enjoy this set of books, although the cast of characters is hard to follow, you have to keep going to the back of the book to find what Family each belongs too..
B006X415GK|5.0|I love Monster High dolls, and for a while I was only collecting the Draculaura dolls, because she is my favorite. But when i saw this doll i HAD TO HAVE HER! I always wanted the comic-con black and white doll, so i was so excited to see that they came out with a new black and white tone doll at such a reasonable price- something everyone can afford. Now to the features about her that I like: like all the other MH dolls, Frankies makes up is beautifuly painted, I love all her stitches as well, as well as her neck bolts. I think her outfit is super cute, and i LOVE her shoes that she comes with too! She also has a braclet included. Her hair is very stiff, so you cant brush it, and she doesnt come with a brush either. She does however, come with a stand with is great. I do wish she came with a few more accesories, but for the price she is, im not gonna complain. great addition to my collection!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I really liked this after I got into it. You really have to pay attention and understand it follows the Buddhist principle of being reincarnated until we get everything right.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far so good. It is great to see Game Insight finally appealing to the kindle fire users.  I am a long time mm player who has been waiting. for this app for the fire
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this movie and story.... anytime I can rent a story with great actors over the age of 50 having fun and romance, I'M IN!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Once you get past the zombies, the story line and characters are awesome! There's a new twist (and sometimes 2) in every episode! I love how the creator brought together characters from all walks of life, that probably otherwise would not have had anything to do with one another.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I like Jack Reacher; a very interesting character. I do not see Tom Cruise as Jack so we will see.
B00006L7XQ|3.0|what more can be said about johnny cash. this cd only had a couple songs that i didnt have on a different disc. when the man comes around, hung my head and hurt are the best on here. the rest were ok.
B004TTHLBE|2.0|I really did not enjoy it. It seemed too fantisafull for me. Maybe I just don't like that kind of book. I read another of his books & semi liked it.
B002B2FZKK|3.0|Malcolm McLaren has a knack for blending different music styles to produce some ethereal music. However, was disappointed that Malcolm took a song called 'She's not there' that was written by Rod Argent and recorded by several artists, notably the Zombies and essentially used it (and it sounds like Colin Blunstone singing) without any reference. It doesn't show Rod Argent as the writer but Malcolm McLaren. I am sure royalties were paid but disappointed such a great song as 'She's not there' was renamed and reclaimed by Malcolm
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|To tell any part of the movie would ruin the whole story line. I wouldn't have expected Jim Carrey to be the lead. It is still bouncing around in my head trying to stick to what's left of the gray matter! Not a movie to watch often but once per annum would be good! Definitely worth the money and the time. To sum it up in one word: Astonishing!
B009KHBDUU|2.0|I kept waiting for the movie to start getting good. I love Tim Burton, John Depp & Helena Bonham Carter. But what they showed in the trailers were the best parts of this movie - very disappointing.<br /><br />I rented the HD version, and it kept buffering, and when it stared to play, it was no longer in HD. I have had this happen before - it is hit or miss w/renting Amazon HD.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I can easily say that The Avengers is now my favorite super hero movie to date.  It is full of likeable characters and great action scenes.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was full of a lot of surprises! There were no slow chapters and was very hard to put down. Another great Grisham book!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|really like this game.  you can keep trying to beat your previous time. good memory game. keeps you thinking.  would highly recommend.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The Racketeer was a unique story that I am still trying to evaluate. I liked the main character, but was a little shocked that he could get away with what he got away with. It always amazes me that people can be so creative in trying to side-step the law to make money.  All in all, it was a good read.
B003TZCFR4|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums... I think of all time, actually. Give it a whirl and see if you fall in love with careless abandon.
B009LL4LMM|3.0|All you permission nut jobs, get over yourself.  Come out of your paranoid shells.  Cute, fun game.....and no, it's not some clandestine project to steal your life. Grow up!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone.  It had everything, great plot, very sympathetic, well developed characters and a satisfying ending. I believe it was the best book I read this summer and will look for more by this author.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book makes you proud when you consider there are still people today that will do the difficult tasks which are sometimes required for our country.  This book details how \\"just regular folks\\" do extraordinary things for the rest of us \\"regular folks\\".  God bless them.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this story.  It is so poignant and so heartfelt.  I can't imagine what it must be like to be in the foster system and never find a place to call home.  This author was really able to depict this scenario and still leave us with a sense of hope.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|If you look at the Google Play Store description of this game, you will see that every single permission is reasoned by the developer. E. g. this game uses leaderboards, thus the device id`s, startup is for push notifications which can be turned off in the game-settings. Billing is for in-app purchases for dlc's. So go ahead and read it for yourself, this game has many positive reviews on the Play Store.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This is the second book in a Trilogy. I liked the way certain items were cleared up from the first book 'The Girl with The Dragon Tatoo'. The book dove tails nicely with all three books. I am currently reading the last of the trilogy 'The Girl Who Kicked Over the Hornet's Nest.'
0060786523|5.0|I read this book originally when I checked it out from the library in hardcover when it was new.  It is such a great book that I wanted to read it again.  Right after I got my Kindle a few years ago I checked to see if this enormously cumbersome book was available in that format and it was not.  My sister in law bought me the trade paperback which is seriously too large to hold up to read comfortably.  Now another year has gone by and this book is still not available on Kindle.  I would pay twice the trade paper price just to get an electronic copy so I could read it in comfort and truly enjoy it.  Why isn't it available in Kindle format?
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I purchased this season through Amazon to watch on my Roku.  The show itself was really very interesting.  Every once in a while the delivery to the Roku would get spotty/grainy, but that could have been my connectivity rather than an Amazon issue.  I am trying to figure out how to get Season 2 now...
B009HV2JT8|4.0|More enjoyable then I expected. Successful attempts at humor. Action scenes enjoyable. I would recommend this movie for an evening of mindless viewing pleasure.
B0070X0PGE|5.0|Dutch group Focus' second album is best known for \\"Hocus Pocus\\".  The rest of the album, especially Focus II and Eruption really define the Focus sound. Guitarist Jan Akkerman and keyboardist Thjis Van Leer had great interplay and received solid support from Cyril Havermans and Pierre Van Der Linden on bass and drums respectively.  A classic album not to be missed!
B007HACDLK|5.0|The story starts with a missing CIA agent in Afghanistan and a crime scene that makes no sense. The plot tension is that the missing man has a treasure trove of secrets in his head that every hostiles intelligence service would kill for. Mitch Rapp's job is to find him and find him fast.<br /><br />I read this book during the two nights after I got the hardcover (right after the official pub date and I don't know why this is labeled as a review of the Kindle Edition). At the outset I was wondering if Vince Flynn was making a deliberate allusion to the classic Orson Welles movie, THE THIRD MAN. The framing of the plot, the book's title and even the cover art for the book all suggested that this could be (in part) an homage to The Third Man.<br /><br />After I finished the book I was convinced that Vince decided to have some fun doing a variation on a theme from The Third Man. To be more specific than that would get me into \\"spoiler\\" territory. The action and intrigue will keep you up late at night reading and reading. In the second half of the book we get into what keeps Mitch Rapp sane as he goes around the world killing men at war with us and \\"who need killing.\\"<br /><br />It would be great to have a zither played as background music for the \\"closing credits\\" of the audio version of this book. (Search for The Third Man Theme on YouTube or watch the movie and you'll know why, plus you'll hear some great music.)
B009329Y30|3.0|This movie was not up to par with some of the other Nicholas Sparks movies.<br />I thought it was rather drab, yet, I did not necessarily enjoy the book as much as<br />his other novels.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved reading this book...confirms my beliefs in the afterlife. Would recommend this book to anyone. Get it today...you will not be able to put it down.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have been reading Grisham since his first publications, but thought he became too repetitive and lacking in suspense.  But with \\"The Racketeer\\" he's back in his groove!  A worthy read!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|The English characters were very real. Except Dev Patel, so were the Indian ones. Patel was a caricature. India / Jaipur were realistically portrayed.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Very disappointing. This book only got vaguely interesting when Rowling was describing the lives of the teens. I never felt any connection with any of the characters and couldn't understand why this was a topic she chose for a book. I am disappointed her editor and the professionals surrounding her would even let this book go to print.
4898153194|4.0|Someone, (not me of coarse), should take 12 of the more popular photos and turn this into a wall calendar. I'd buy several for gifts, along with one for myself.  I'm just saying...
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Cannot put this game down .. I have beat this game several times and I still love to play it .. works great on my KINDLE
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn offers so many station choices.  The searches are easy.  The best feature for me is the sleep timer. I tune in some relaxing music while falling asleep and it shuts itself off.
0783235380|5.0|This was a very romantic comedy, appealing to all ages.<br />The content was light and watching this movie makes<br />for good family entertainment
B005BDZQKU|5.0|The clarity and those colours ...POW!<br /><br />A spectrum of talented people combining to produce a truly wonderful piece of art.<br /><br />Two directors would have been bound for creative conflict but what a great result.<br /><br />People actually wanting to do the best they could. All focussing their energies on a common goal.<br />You can feel the creators passion on the screen.<br /><br />So much that passes for film today seems to reflect the prancings of show ponies.<br />When so many films are designed for the smash 'em up hate 'em all crowd (i.e. the monied trawled crowd)<br />we have this breath of fresh air from the 1960's.<br /><br />So I'm nostalgic. Not a bad thing.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|My father and his fellow Marines came back from The Pacific during WW2.  And for the most part, they never said a word about it.  Not even to their family.  This book tells you much about why they never said a word.  It is worth reading if for no other reason than, to know.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Although not really realistic, this is an action packed movie that doesn't stop pretty much from begining to end. The good guys win.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|ai iust use it as a battery monitor but other than that it is an insane app. 18 19 20.
B005LAII08|3.0|The fusion of animation between Disney and Pixar studios has resulted in some dynamite movies over the past few years. Many have become the classics of the future for children including movie series like CARS and TOY STORY. There hasn't been a single movie from the combined efforts of these two that has yielded a bad movie. This holds true for their latest release to DVD, BRAVE.<br /><br />BRAVE takes place in an unnamed country that more than likely is Scotland pre-Christianity days. These Celtic warriors talk tough and battle against the likes of bears when not fighting one another (something alluded to as the film progresses). In this world is a young princess named Merida, a free spirited young woman who loves to roam the countryside with her bow and arrows, riding her horse and climbing mountains. But that's not the thing that a princess should be doing as her mother reminds her of over and over.<br /><br />Her mother wants Merida to be a young lady of refinement, ready to take over the duties of a queen when the day comes. That day comes sooner than Merida would like when her mother and father inform her that the leaders of the other three clans are on their way bringing with them their first born sons, her eligible suitors. Ever the misunderstood teen in these sorts of films, Merida revolts against her parents and when a tournament is held to determine who will win her hand, it is Merida who wins the match and announces she is free to choose as she likes. This doesn't go well with the clans and arguing ensues.<br /><br />Back at the castle Merida and her mother have words that result in Merida slicing a tapestry of her family her mother made and running off to the woods. In the woods she comes across a Stonehenge type area where she spies a sprites (blue lit fairies of a sort) that guide her to a house in the woods where a witch lives. Talking about her desire to determine her own fate, she makes a bargain with the witch to help find a way to change her mother.<br /><br />Returning with a gift for her mother, a treat that contains the spell, her mother eats a portion of it only to become ill. Once in her room with Merida's help, her mother changes into a black bear. Not a good thing since Merida's father is known for being a bear killer. The two escape the castle and head back to find the witch's house in hopes of returning the queen back into herself.<br /><br />In order for this to happen, Merida and her mother must mend the tear in their relationship that has come about. Not only must they do this figuratively they must do so literally as well with the tapestry. Along the way they begin to understand one another clearer than they did in the past. But if they don't take care of this problem soon, the queen might stay this way forever.<br /><br />What we have here is a failure to communicate. Okay I had to say that. But the gist of the story lies in the inability between a teen and her parent to be able to come to a common ground. This, as well as several exposed bottoms on the warriors, makes the film more inclined to be one for teens as opposed to the younger crowd. That might not be easy since by that age they're past cartoons, computer animated or not.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining with some great music in it. The animation as always is breath taking to behold and you'll wonder just as I did how they are able to capture such detail in some areas like Merida's hair. The story is one that might even help a few teens and their parents come to terms with one another and communicate better than before seeing the film.<br /><br />My only problem was that this isn't the sort of film Disney was known for. In the past magic was on display in Disney films but was used as a plot device. The jaded apple, the pumpkin carriage and such. In this film the magic stems from Celtic symbols and revolves around magic. This might not mean much to some people but for me it gave the film a different feel than the normal Disney films I grew up with.<br /><br />Still, the movie does offer a nice piece of entertainment. It tells the story of a young girl looking to find her way in life and how she achieves that. For me, it won't go down as a classic Disney tale and my guess is it won't be remembered as well as most, but it's still a good movie.s I grew up with.<br /><br />Still, the movie does offer a nice piece of entertainment.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Likeable characters, fun, thrilling and entertaining.  I am  a John Grisham fan and this one didn't disappoint.  Wondered where the story was going and didn't want it to end.
B000URWYTS|4.0|What an interesting take on an innovative architect who made his mark in America.  It makes one ponder and sheds some light on the history of the times.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Scotty  lives around the corner in my world.  We find through him you not only understand us - you begin to see yourselves.  We love this human child and look forward to his growth as a voice many will listen to.
B007704HO6|5.0|I thought the trials and tribulations of Bob and his adopted companion James through out this story where both moving and uplifting at times bringing both laughter and tears. Thank you James for sharing your heart warming journey with us all. I look forward to the on going antics of Bob and his friend in future publications. This is well worth the 5 stars awarded
B008BM9L72|5.0|Omg me and my boyfriend really like these books ;) xx love it x x x x x c x
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is awesome I bought the fullversion its even better more stuff infinate time buttons are better I love it its way better than mc pe so all you haters better be quiet
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This was a story that did not hold together well. I have never read a Scarpetta book where she was so insecure and I couldn't draw a logical conclusion. The antagonist was so minor and inconsequential that he wasn't even introduced until the last 1/4 of the book. And so many side stories that were never addressed- Toby, Luke, Marino  and his Internet issues. Just a weird book and definitely not her best. I barely remember reading the middle of the book.
B005DOL0R0|2.0|Kindle Fire HD... is too big for the sleeve..  Cannot close the zipper..j. had to buy another.... Order #103-7785543-158 refers...
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|No offense to crack users.  But seriously, why are there so many 5 star reviews for this book?  I don't get it.  It was horrible.  The story is stupid, the characters are stupid, and the relationship between Travis and Abby is stupid. I definitely do not recommend.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I have had the G155 since September of 2011.  I have used it in many different situations: traveling for work, vacation, in the living room when my wife is watching the \\"Real Housewives of wherever\\".  I even sat in my driveway playing Batman Arkham City on Halloween last year, while handing out candy.  It is great for what it is - a portable environment for hardcore gaming.  The viewing angles are a *little* limited both horizontally and vertically, but I can't detract from the score as it is designed to be viewed directly from close up, it isn't really an issue.  Other reviewers have commented about the speakers - I will say that these speakers perform as well as I would expect.  They aren't booming, but are adequate, and I always use headphones anyway.<br /><br />I love my G155 so much that I have ordered the UNSC Vanguard and I plan to keep my G155 if I do in fact receive a Vanguard.  Unfortunately I didn't order the Vanguard until Nov. 10th, so I am not sure if I will even get one at all as they are currently sold out of what I believe to be a fairly limited run.  (I wish I had paid closer attention to the info about the Vanguard, as I had assumed it was simply a Halo themed Sentry.)<br /><br />To sum up, I recommend the Project Gaems G155 to anybody who wants a portable, self contained, Audio/Video system for console gaming.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|this game used to be fun until they did the update and started trying to force us to download other games for quest. I will no longer participate.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This album is Susan Boyle's best to date in my admittedly picky view.  Arrogantly labeling myself as a real music lover, I quickly shy away from artificial noise music, repetitive lyrics and unnecessary vocal acrobatics.  While I have never had to shy from Susan Boyle's music, this album is so spectacular as to practically shut me up.<br /><br />  Susan's almost miraculous take on Somewhere Over The Rainbow and Memory leave me staring at my speakers, wondering how does she do that.  Her ability to express such a variety of emotions and her remarkable vocal expertise just eclipses most other offerings.<br /><br />  One could write all day about the feelings evoked by The Winner Takes It All, Bring Him Home, As Long As He Needs Me, Out Here On My Own, and You'll Never Walk Alone.  Susan's voice leaves no doubt that these songs touched her and then she touched me.  Big time.  Every song has something special, and the variety contributes to making this album a winner.<br /><br />  The duets with Donny Osmond are a treat I never expected.  He is so perfect with her and she with him.  Amazing vocal blending in this collaboration.  The Music Of The Night with Michael Crawford is a whole new experience in hearing Susan for me.  Clearly playing the role and loving it.<br /><br />  I feel a bit helpless that one can only give five stars to this amazing album.  A must have for those who love this type of music and probably for a good many who just don't yet know they love it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This album is awesome! She has grown up some much and this album tells you that. My favorite song right now is \\"All Too Well\\" GORGEOUS song. She did such a great job with these songs. She is a great role model for younger kids. I defintely recommed this album and all of hers.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I purchased this game for my daughter a few months back. She has had it for months and still loves it.  However I would reccomend one of the booster packs to have additional cards to make it less likely become obvious what your making after playing the game numerous times.. We did add pieces to make the game more fun, I thought of this as more of a starter kit. We kept a mini notebook with a running tally of the pieces we wish we had.<br />The key is to remember that you don't have to make a supremely detailed model; you just have to make enough to help people guess. You can say \\"I ran out of green so pretend the yellow is green.\\" It's never been a problem for us. The drawback is the game does not come with enough blocks to make all the items on the card.  However if you already have extra legos at home this will not be a problem.  And you can always improvised as I have stated above.<br />The game holds up really well and overall it is a fun change of pace from the traditional board games on the market.<br />Also the ages are 7+ my daughter was able to play this well even though she is only 5.
034580404X|5.0|These book was absolutely wonderful, even though it leaves you wanting more. And it will truly open your mind in exploring your sexuality. Love it can't wait for more from the author.<br /><br />Opinions about each book:<br /><br />Book 1: Was kind of dry and dull I want to say for the first four chapters but after you get past that its hard to put the book down.<br /><br />Book 2: Loved it<br /><br />Book 3: Near the end you will be begging for more but it ends like a typically love story will end...But because I think you should read it I will not spoil any juicy details.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Loved the back story and It's great to have an old friend back!<br />The book was well paced and kept me flipping though. Can't wait for the next one.
B004HW7JH4|2.0|I am a big fan of MAD MEN and really enjoy watching each an every episode.<br />However being located in Switzerland and the fact that the DVD are have regional<br />protection don't allow me to watch it with my DVD player on TV, but only on my PC.<br />This is far less comfortable than sitting on my couch thus only 2 stars.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|In this book Cornwell returns to the basics to some extent - forensic investigation. But there seems to be too little FUN in the book. No joking or bantering like in the first few books. Everybody is so disfunctional. And ultimately the perpetrator is caught almost by accident. No guessing who did it based on the evidence, which makes the reveal kind if a let down. I keep hoping to get the same enjoyment out of Cornwell that I did with her early books.  This doesn't do it, but it's the closest she's come in a while.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Wonderful guy.  Wonderful talent.  I wish he was still around.  He was the best a listener could ever hope to find.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This is a really god book, second in Trilogy.  I already bought the 3rd book.  Can't wait to finish the series.  The book is well written, keeps you interested throughout with lots of action and good development of the characters.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|We ordered this show and watched it with two of our small grandchildren.  They were transfixed until the movie ended!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Love this app and love the website. Peripatetically speaking, the website's vocabulary quiz is worth the visit. I bet M-W is at a loss for words after reading this review.
B00943SQCI|1.0|This movie is poorly written, not funny and has no relation to the television series whatsoever. I was really looking forward to this movie and was saddened to find that it was poorly written and appeared that its creators had never seen the original Dark Shadows television series. The humor was lame and predictable and the story was poorly conceived and acted. Do not waste your money on this trash.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A truly engrossing dystopian novel. A must read for all ages, a book worthy of a thousand praises and I just can't write them all down. This book is one hell of an art that every eye should feast upon.
B002BWP49M|1.0|how easy they charged me the movie and send me the when I will send nesesito mi pelicula o el dinero ok
B00932A2MC|4.0|Entertaining movie with good special effects.<br />Story line is classic Sci-Fi: humans vs aliens (with a simple boy/girl love interest).<br />Did not see as much of Liam Neeson as I thought I would, but an entertaining movie all-in-all.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|My dtr is a 1D fan. This is a great video. It is worth the money. It is great for sleepovers.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What can I say that hasn't been said in 13,000 reviews already? Well, 1st off....I truly have had more fun reading the reviews for the 2nd installment of this trilogy then I had reading 50 Shades of Grey. My mistake was NOT reading any reviews before I purchased (due to all the hoopla)50 Shades. But I did start reading before I went on with the 2nd book. By the time I got to page 28 of reviews I found a 3 star review (28 pages of 1 or 2 stars!!!). I'm sure this reviewer (on the 29th page!) is in her early teens. 50 Shades held so much potential to be really good, but never quite made it. Poor writing, poor editing, poor everything! I had no problem with the sex except it was repetitive and very unrealistic. Really people, WHAT IS ALL THE FUSS? 50 Shades was a waste of my time and money and I am an avid reader. I do NOT enjoy giving bad reviews, but I am waiting for the time in my life when I can say I have forgotten all about this book. I'm sure its coming soon as 50 Shades is only memorable for how VERY bad it was to read! My biggest fear is not being able to trust the NYT best sellers list ever again.
B00A135YUW|5.0|Love Lana Del Rey's voice. Could not get enough of \\"Born to Die\\" and had it on repeat for weeks and weeks. This EP has some really catchy tracks with her sultry voice and haunting lyrics. The tracks are on the darker side. I note more emotion and scale in her voice. Just listened to it a few times already and like the tracks \\"Cola\\", \\"American\\" & \\"body electric\\". I'm sure the rest of the tracks are going to grow on me in the next few hours. If you liked her prior album you will love these tracks. Stop reading and start downloading !
B007EE4XKI|5.0|Mack's latest project \\"Cold Equations: The Persistence of Memory\\" is an incredibly engaging story  which is impossible to put down!  His introduction of the father of Data and B4 as a main character, as well as his very well-crafted plot, creates an appealing narrative and reinstates one of the most beloved characters of the Star Trek series.  Handling all of this with aplomb and imagination, Mack does not disappoint his readers for a nanosecond with an appealing premise and intrigue which will allow future scenarios to expand the Star Trek universe for many years.  Great story, superbly written and I expected nothing less from David Mack!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun<br />Anyone with time to waste<br />Takes some skill<br />And some swift hand eye coordination<br />Will keep you coming back for more
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I loved this game as a kid and spent way too much allowance on it. This way I can play the game I loved without going broke or standing at a fair all day. I highly recommend it.
159413586X|4.0|Does this instalment live up to the previous two? In my mind, no. It seems very rushed by comparison, things happen, then don't happen, then everything is over before you know it.<br /><br />I can understand that this may be intentional on the part of the author. Since we see everything through Katniss's eyes, we also feel her confusion and frustration at events. Things happen that are beyond her control. This leads to a disjointed feeling; the book doesn't flow easily.<br /><br />Saying that, I still enjoyed the story. I would give this book a 3.5 if there was that option. I was fairly satisfied with how things worked out but there are a lot of questions I would like to have had answered too.<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and am glad I chose to buy instead of rent.  I normally do choose that option, and this lets me know exactly why.  What a tender story, I was laughing and crying the whole time.  I LOVED IT.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very well written and a great deal of new information. I found the book intriguing and very hard to put down. I definitely recommend this book for all Lincoln enthusiasts.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Grest sound i compared to beats and not that different in sound, very comfortable to wear for hours at a time but i did sweat slot while wearing them 20 feet of cable makes them hard to travel with but i bought them for home i give them 4.2 out of 5 for some minor sound issues and the heat around your ear from the very padded ear covers
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I picked up this book after rave reviews and I did like it, but there were a few things that stuck in my craw about it, and that's why I only gave it three stars.<br /><br />The main difficulties I have with it derive from the book's relationship to Twilight. I know, of course, that this book has its origins in a Twilight fanfiction (called Masters of the Universe), so similarities are only natural. However, once I realised it, it seemed to blatantly stand out to me. Most of the characters are there (albeit with different names/occupations), and it's hard to push that aside.<br /><br />My biggest problem is also rooted in Twilight, and that is that I hated Bella as a protagonist and Ana suffers from the same flaws: a good-looking girl who thinks she's ugly, that she doesn't deserve happiness, who can't understand why any man would want her. I find that incredibly off-putting and I wanted to slap Ana a few times because of it (though she might have liked that).<br /><br />If you can separate Fifty Shades from Twilight then I think you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads.
B005MLOKXA|3.0|unfortunately I have not been able to review season two -season one was great - due to geographical restrictions. I am living in Brazil anfd cannot download the Good Wife season two even I bought it last month. However, I am interested in reviewing the series so maybe you can send me a hard copy.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|*This review refers to the 2-disc blu-ray release*<br /><br />Just watching the first few minute of the blu-ray version of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" told<br />me the remainder of the movie would be fantastic and it was.<br /><br />Sound quality is superb and never has it been clearer. Background noises<br />are easily distinguished well not overpowering the vocal tracks.<br /><br />The image is superb and it shows a studio dedicated to getting it right. Just enough grain<br />and the colors really pop out. I have seen various versions of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" on DVD, TV, and VHS<br />and the blu-ray release outdoes them all easily. I say ref. quality.<br /><br />Easily my best blu-ray purchase thus far this year and certainly one of the best<br />movies ever was given the due it deserves. The interview with Peter O'Toole was<br />quit good along with the \\"making of\\" which was slightly over an hour in length.<br /><br />If you love the movie and have a blu-ray player this is a must purchase in my opinion.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|They still have power, nice music. I'm pretty sure you can find five or more hits in there.<br />If you like The Killers, go and buy this.
0451228731|2.0|I thought this book had a really interesting concept and I enjoyed seeing how things panned out. However, sometimes I found the pacing a bit hard to follow. I thought there were also too many questions left unanswered, but because of how hard I found this book to read, I don't think I'll bother with a sequel.<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|This book has changed how I wake up and start my life everyday! It not only works but the message is clear and easy to understand exactly what you need to do. Thanks Rhonda you made a difference.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Loved the story the characters were convincing and I loved the depth of lou's feelings for Will how they crept up on her.....A good book
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Typical Reacher book.  I only wish I would have read this book prior to reading \\"Don't Know Jack\\"  This would have explained a lot!
0545425115|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I thought the pacing was great and I flew through it in just a day.<br /><br />I didn't give the book five stars for the following reasons:<br /><br />-The other tributes are incredibly one-dimensional. We have no idea why the richer ones would want to participate in the games. Most of them are no more than a name or number to up the body count. We don't learn anything about them, which makes it hard to see them as real characters and not just set pieces.<br /><br />-I found the plot very derivative of Battle Royale. I'm sure this has been said a thousand times, but the premise is almost exactly identical. Battle Royale is one of my favourite books, so that probably made this grate a bit more on me than other people, but I honestly feel that BR is much superior, especially with regards to character development.<br /><br />Saying that, I still think it's worth four stars. It was good to see what all the fuss was about and not be disappointed by it. I'm hoping that the rest of the sequels will give the author a chance to branch out with more original plotlines and develop the background characters more.<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|I had no problem loading this to my kindle and it played very smoothly. I'm glad it's available on amazon so that I can watch it whenever I want.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of his best, John Grisham weaves a twisting plot that entertains!!  A must read, hope you enjoy the story as much as I did
B009B4ZEKM|3.0|It just doesn't seem like she's ever going to top Stripped. Stripped was even nominated for a Grammy. Back to basics was also, but still, Stripped is better than Back to basics, in my opinion.<br />I don't know, I just don't think she will ever surpass Stripped. Where's another spanish album?!?!? she mentioned several years ago she was going to start another spanish album, I mean come on. How much time does she need off between albums.
0316223239|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. In the beginning I found it really hard to read, purely because of the subject matter. Despite 5-year-old Jack's innocent perspective, it was still plain that his mother was in immense distress and for the first quarter of the book I was still undecided as to whether I'd finish it or not.<br /><br />Once I got over that first little hill, I couldn't put the book down. Through Jack's eyes I felt I was seeing everything in a whole new way and this really added to the story. I thought it was a clever choice on behalf of the author to write it that way. It was impossible to read, though, without thinking on recent real-life events that surely inspired this tale, and it made me realise that a lot can go on under our own noses without us ever knowing.<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great second book to the trilogy.  It left me hanging enough to want read the third one immediately,  and the entire book kept me interested.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a really interesting documentary and very well made. It really makes me consider the impact of my food choices. Well worth the $2.99 :).
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love to play hidden games and of course the adventure ones are even better. compared to some of the other games I have played, this game is a 2 thumbs up and with the kindle fire hd the graphic are great. If you love unsolved hidden object games, I truely recomened this game. I can't wait for the others to come out. Enjoy!!!
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Everything comes to a close in the final instalment of Fifty Shades. While Book 2 was fairly slow-moving, everything it set up comes to fruition here, and we learn a lot more about Christian's background. It's still awfully written, and really cringe-worthy, but it's worth seeing through to the end.<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads.
B003TQKVGU|2.0|Basic stuff really!! Positive thinking is all it boils down to. This type of book appears every ten years or so and this is one of the old ones.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|This movie is great if you're an old salt, like me. They actually filmed a good deal of this in various locations around the globe, so they were able to duplicate the various water colors, etc. This is mostly a rollicking old swashbuckler with a bit of drama thrown in by the captain and his doctor bickering occasionally. It also showed how brutal the British Navy could be in order to maintain discipline.<br /><br />If you're an old sailor and have ever spent any time on a tall ship or just about any old wooden boat, you'll enjoy watching some of the 'up-in-the-rigging' stuff.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this was the first game I played on my kindle fire and it is absolutely addicting. I would recommend this game to anyone who has a kindle fire!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|An improvement over the first book. Ana has developed a bit more of a personality and a backbone (though she can be frustrating at times) and the story progresses outside just Christian and Ana's relationship. It has also set up a few things for the third book which should be exciting.<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Very intense, enjoy working out with Jillian, she gives you levels to adjust at your own pace.  If you like a good workout this is a good purchase for you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show and great play no skipping or pauses.  Just wish it were cheaper then I would buy more often.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Hated it to end.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Good for all ages not just teens adults also.
1594135851|4.0|One of my main criticisms of the first book was a lack of originality (because there was so much in common with Battle Royale), but I think this instalment has gone a good way towards correcting that.<br /><br />Yes, the games are still there, but are almost more of a framing device for the rest of the book and for the forging of new relationships. The politics of the Capitol and the Districts comes to the fore as we, the readers, come to realise, through Katniss's eyes, that the Games are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what the Capitol is capable of.<br /><br />My other criticism of the first book was that the other tributes were very two-dimensional, but this has also been addressed. Of course, we can't learn about them all, but many more of them than before play important roles in the plot as we learn about their motivations.<br /><br />Finally, I hope you have Mockingjay on hand, because this ends in an unexpected cliffhanger!<br /><br />Note: I also posted this review on Goodreads.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|So thankful Amazon sells these movies on DVD. It's hard to find DVD. This is a cute one from Disney, it is a little scarier than other Disney movies, but that's because it's in Scotland in the woods. The character is one any girl will love.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Well, what can be said? Angry Birds has gone to a new height! I laughed aloud when I first saw the little birds made to resemble Star Wars characters, and then when the little guy used his light saber, well.. You get  the idea! buy this game!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|When I Look at the Reviews for this book, They were not good, but one of the review said that if you like Twilight that you would like the book, so I get the book and am glad I did, the book is for adults , but it a great read, I have read it three times.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|I was never able to get this app to work correctly. This reminded me of the old video tape recorders.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This is an updated version of the old classic game, I believe it was called \\"Breakout\\"? They game is simple, yet challenging and it can be fun to test one's reflexes. I also think that since little reading or strategy is involved, it's quite suitable for even young children. Fun game!
B008458O3S|3.0|This is a rather entertaining puzzle game.  Had almost nothing to do with trains, and I beat it in a few days. Got it free as the app of the day, worth a download, but I wouldn't pay for it.
B009LL4LMM|2.0|I would really like to enjoy these types of games but they are all the same. and this one makes me keep asking myself why the Scrubbing Bubbles give a rat turd about flying?
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I'm not sure if I would have been AS in love with this film if I had not watched the entire TV series.  In Firefly (13 episodes then cancelled), the character development is almost complete by the end of the pilot episode.  River's personality takes a while to develop, and Jayne evolves as well during the 13 weeks, but mostly, you are in love with each unique character right away.  I've never seen it done better.<br />The story lines are nice, too, but I almost think that is not the point.  At the end of the movie, I leave not saying \\"I want more adventure\\", but \\"I want to see more of Zoe and Mal and Inara, and especially the delightful Kaylee\\".
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Our beloved ZZ Top is back!  We have missed you guys, and your great original style that we have come to love over all these years. Great stuff as usual!

159420411X|2.0|For a book about signal and noise, it delivers remarkably few insights.  The book is full of examples and storie but does not teach readers how to apply basic statistical skills to make better predictions.  It is full of \\"whats\\", but very few \\"whys\\" and no \\"hows\\".  It is a good coffee table book and a great conversation starter but teaches readers precious little.  I found the hedgehog and fox analogy and the primer about Bayesian statistics useful, but neither was developed sufficiently with specific examples - despite the author's concluding remark that this book is about Bayesian statistics.  The author - or the editors - dumbed down the book so much that it turned a potential Lawrence of Arabia into Iron Man, without the pyrotechnics.  Pity.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|I like the actor.  His outlook is good for comedy.  This movie is an old story but he plays good in it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just love these characters and everything that happens in the book was just so fun and exciting. I have no clue what to expect with the third book and I can't wait to read more.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|This book is great as are all his other books.  However, they dont capture the magic that \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" did.  Its an interesting read though.  It does keep you engaged and you want to keep reading.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Story is weak. Characters are cardboard. FX mundane. Waste of Rapace's talent and looks. Aliens was SO good.  This is SO bad.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Just like I recommend to this TV show before, it worth for you to own your own DVD.  Highly recommend.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|With all the remakes that have been coming out and all the disappointments, this movie is definitely above all of that. The cast does a perfect job and was the perfect fit for their roles. They played their characters with perfect precision and the story line does an excellent job at, if you pay attention to it from the beginning, explaining why there are differences from the Original Star Trek story.<br /><br />Definitely a 5 star rating for a 5 star movie.  Impatiently waiting for the next movie to be released!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor so deserves the many awards she has received during the past 7 years. She is an amazing writer and artist and her fun personality shines through in several songs on here, such as 'Stay, Stay, Stay' and '22'. My favorite line from the album is from 'State of Grace' when she says, \\"You were never a saint, and I loved in shades of wrong. We tried to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts. This love is brave and wild.\\" Sooo beautiful!! The guitar and drums on 'State of Grace' and 'Holy Ground' are incredible.<br /><br />Through Amazon, I got the CD 'Red' just a few days after ordering and it was in perfect condition as promised. Thank you for your prompt and reliable service.
B000002GQL|2.0|I have the misfortune of owning a \\"BMG Direct Marketing\\" edition of this CD, and it sounds like it was ripped from an old 1972 record.  So the sound quality might be ruining my impression of this album.  It is hard to hear the vocals amidst the over-busy instrumental mix, and when the lyrics can be distinguished, they are a meandering stream-of-conscious mess, perhaps drug-induced.  There are many timeless classics from 1972, but this album just sounds old and dated.  Do not recommend.<br /><br />I'm a little curious about the newer re-masterings with more tracks.  Maybe they sound a lot better.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|If you like to watch FX movie, this one is still ok for you.  But It's not worth to won one.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|I was perhaps more excited for this box set than anything I've purchased music-related in decades.  Unfortunately my excitement left me when I saw the condition of both the shipping box, the product box, and the albums and materials inside.  The shipping box was badly damaged when it arrived and some of that damage translated to the product box corners (dinged in a bit).  The packing material was a paltry few plastic air bubbles around the sides of the product box, nothing on top or bottom.  With the shipping box being way oversized that led to a lot of bouncing around.  Once i opened the actual box set other problems appeared pretty quickly.  Several album jackets had bent/creased corners, and a few had inner sleeves that look like someone at the factory crumpled them up before inserting the vinyl.  A real shame considering the sleeves are otherwise decent and poly-lined.  The additional 'psychedelic' red/white paper sleeve in Peppers was also creased badly.  I examined each piece of vinyl and found a few with obvious scratches that did produce noise when played.<br /><br />The book included was in perfect condition and is stunning.<br /><br />None of the damage described here was major, but it's the summation of all of it that makes it obvious there was a total lack of QC during the manufacturing of this product.<br /><br />Not happy at all about this, but considering returning it for a replacement rather than a refund.  Maybe I'll get lucky next time.<br /><br />Quick Update 11/15/2012 - I received my 2nd box set yesterday (I ordered one to play, 1 for the archive to remain sealed and maybe give to my son 20 years from now).  Anyways, the second set arrived in much better shape, but it again was not packaged in the original foam wrapped shipping containers that others are raving about online.  This time it arrived in a smaller outer box, but was packed around it with crumpled up packing paper.  not much better than the first set.  I think i just got lucky that nothing happened during shipment.<br /><br />My main concern tonight is with the quality of sound on this vinyl.  Both of my copies of Abbey Road and The White Album (i opened both box sets due to all of these problems) have an incredible amount of noise on them.  i'm not a vinyl expert by any means, but i know a noisy record when i hear it.  i know others are raving about the sound quality, but my sets sound like garbage...Returning both for refunds.<br /><br />Update #2 - 11/17/2012 !!<br /><br />Have any of you found the major misprint on side two of the label of Magical Mystery Tour?  Go look!<br /><br />If this doesn't just ice the cake of complete failure on this box set, nothing will.  ABSOLUTELY NO QUALITY CONTROL WHATSOEVER!<br /><br />Update #3 - 11/24/2012!<br /><br />Ordered box set #3, this time from Amazon UK.  The box arrived quickly (even with the holiday in there), and was packaged as hoped, inside the official EMI 'outer' box with the cool 'Handle With Care' labeling, foam inserts etc.  Unfortunately someone thought handle with care meant drop the box on the floor and crush one corner in so badly that even the foam inserts weren't enough to prevent the box set from a small but noticeable corner ding.  oh well, i could live with that i guess, seeing as this thing just traveled thousands of miles.  Several differences noted between the EU box set and the U.S. box:<br /><br /> - overall EU box was manufactured with significantly higher overall quality.<br /><br /> - EU box is about .5 inches smaller in both height and width, due to thinner black foam pads inside the box.  EU box also came with silica gel packets resting in top portion of box set.  There was no shrink wrapping on the EU box set, only on individual records and the book.<br /><br /> - EU record jackets are much higher in quality, seemingly slightly stronger card stock, and noticeably glossier.  Absolutely no record jacket, inner sleeve, or 'extras' damage in the EU box.  Notably, gatefoldshad more precise 'hinge side' squaring than my U.S. box versions.  The EU gatefolds also seem to be sized a bit better to hold all of the extras without having that strange jacket warp the U.S. versions have.<br /><br /> - EU vinyl labels were all perfectly centered, and appear to be printed with better quality that the U.S. set.<br /><br /> - EU vinyl had no signs of no-fill, with only two minor surface defects, one on Sgt. Peppers and one on MMT.<br /><br />And now for the bad news.  6 of the EU discs were significantly warped.  I haven't had a chance to play all of them yet, but the two I did were warped enough to affect playability.<br /><br />My plan is to talk to Amazon UK about getting a replacement box, or individual records to replace my warped copies.  At this time Amazon UK is not selling the box set due to 'reported customer problems'.  I assume this could mean the warping issue is fairly prevalent in the EU pressings.  Hoping this may also mean they are waiting on a second pressing before they resume selling.  Why Amazon U.S. isn't putting a similar halt on sales is beyond me...had more precise 'hinge side' squaring than my U.S. box versions.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|First i'd like to point out that this will be review of limited edition statue and not show itself.<br />So let's get down to business :)<br />The statue looks pretty cool and it's definitelly worth 60$ that i originally paid,but price went up 10$ since then, and  in my opinion it's 10$ too much.<br />There has been a lot of complaining about the paint job on the head,but with exception of the right eye (they did bad job here) everything looks great.<br />Details are amazing and everything seems so real.<br />For example,when you touch the nose or ears it feels like you touching real persons face,so that seems like a big plus to me.<br /><br />Downside of this set appears in two places.<br />First is screwdriver. While pretty good visually, it's made of some really light plastic and honestly it feels like you could brake it with one finger. Second downside is the base of the head (whit Walking dead logo), and here is the same problem like screwdriver-same light and probably cheap plastic.<br /><br />I should also mention that blue ray packaging that comes with the zombie head is exclusive and you can't buy it without the statue (big plus for amazing cover art ;) ).<br /><br />So this is it<br />All in all,it's a good set that i would recommend to any fan out there who likes statues and stuff like that...<br />If not, than save your money and buy second season without the statue,after all it's \\"The walking dead\\" show that's important here :)
B006FE83U4|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is in my estimation, and many others, the single most important piece of work to ever come out of Hollywood. The movie covers much more than just racism. It's a tale of how judging others without knowledge is as dangerous and illiterate as a murderer. Unfortunately our society has embraced judging others, whether by media influence or just plain ignorance. It is a tale of growing up in a society that doesn't practice what it preaches (pun intended). It's the story of a man whose entire life boils down to the simplest of emotions, empathy.<br /><br />Why is it that a movie loved and universally praised can't be used as a blueprint for the society from which it came and today's society as well? Have we truly become so enamored of our own self-serving interests that we can't see what it's doing to our world.<br /><br />I don't know about anyone one else, but aside from my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Atticus Finch, fictitious though he may be, is a personal role model for my life, and has been since I first read the book in third grade. I would give anything and everything I own to see the evolution of mankind take on the characteristics of Atticus Finch, Scout, Jem (and, Lord forgive me, no more of those whose main goal in life seems to be to make the whole world about them).

B000P0J02E|2.0|I specifically purchased this \\"sound track\\" for the first song \\"Hoist the Colours\\", as I found it haunting enough to be included in a Halloween theme music mix CD.<br /><br />Imagine my dismay when I find it incomplete!  In the movie, between the boy's solo and the pirates' chorus, a condemned black pirate, up on the gallows with the boy also sings a verse.  That is missing from this supposed sound track.<br /><br />I am not pleased.

0062197258|5.0|If you are a fan of psychological fiction, please do try this one.  How does a very sick man create a girl with OCD?  Well, one way is definitely explained in this story.  It begins with a trial as well as ends with a trial.  Each section flips from the past to the present in Catherine's life.  Well written and easy to follow once the reader realizes and accepts the quick flipping from past to present.  Short sections.  Easy to comprehend and well put together.  I am a fan, and it seems the English ladies, (SJ Bolton, Rosamund Lupton and now Elizabeth Haynes) are must reads for me.  Excellent.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I think that it is very stupid that I should have to pay to play more new levels, I paid full price for the game and I should be able to play all the content from the new updates

B008PE9GSA|5.0|Was told ZZ Top had finally produced an album much like their old stuff. At first I was a little hesitant in that Antenna from 9 yrs ago was such a disappointment. Upon listening to snipits of each song on Amazon, I immediately purchased and have not regretted. Billy Gibbons, Dusty Hill and Frank Beard bring it like they used to. Got cd in my deck right now. My only regret is not catching them this past summer in Dallas as I'm sure they were promoting this not yet released album which I was totally unaware of.  40 yrs now of making big, big sound! Recent release takes me back to much simpler times. A must have for any ZZ Top fan!!!
B002BWP49M|5.0|The blue-ray I received was in excellent condition. It was still in the plastic.

1451662432|5.0|I think this is a good autobio as I feel what Arnold was able to accomplish was quite amazing. He speaks to hard work and vision a lot and it clearly paid off for him. I think the book is not selling well because his core fans are males and he is just coming off a governorship that was not very popular. He also just went thru the whole mess with the maid that has painted him in a negative light, but trust me, this is a worth while read.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD because I hate working out but I want to get in shape (and hopefully once I'm in better shape working out will be more fun!). I knew I could force myself to commit to 20 min a day and that even if I didn't lose weight, it would be good for me to try. I have been through Level One three times now, have continued my regular eating habits (which are average to healthy), and I've already lost 1.5 lbs (and I weigh in daily with no variation generally and I had just eaten when I weighed myself last night so I know this loss is for real!). I am so excited. I started this now to get in shape before the holidays so my metabolism is ready for a challenge and I have less work to do come January. The workout is challenging but very doable, and I was SO sore after the first day but since then I have been fine. Just like with any exercise routine, be careful to do the moves correctly and listen to your body otherwise you could get injured. I am hoping to lose 10-15lbs by the end of the 30 day period and I am on my way! The best part of this program is that it only takes 20 min...it is a lot easier to talk myself into a hardcore 20 min workout than it is for me to talk myself into taking an hour run. I know it will be over before I know it and I'll be glad I did it :)
B0091REZMW|3.0|difficult and a money grabber. but if you like search and find games, you'll appreciate the difficulty level.  know going in what you are downloading and you won't be disappointed.
B000002KJM|1.0|Let me start by saying that I listen to this album a lot in its entirety... ON VINYL.  I would never waste my money on this CD reissue of the album because all of the songs were remixed with those cheesy 1980's sound effects and production techniques.  So, basically, this remixed album lacks the crisp sound that the original mix had.  I know that vinyl will always sound crisper than CD, but a CD with the original mix of this album would sound a lot cleaner and less cheesy than the production quality of this remix.<br /><br />So, do not buy this CD.  The band has stated that they would be reissuing their first 6 albums on CD in their original mixes, and did have already released 3 of these promised reissues.  So just sit tight and I think we shall see the other reissues within the next few years.

0451196716|4.0|This is one of Kings better reads and one of his shorter novels but quite compelling. It's the story of perhaps either the not-too-distant-future or an alternate reality where bloodthirsty games are an integral part of a military rule kind of society. A man known only as \\"The General\\" seems to preside over the country but little is said about him, he remains a mystery figure throughout the story. The story entails an annual event called the \\"Long Walk\\" that is open to teenage boys under 18 years of age, where 100 will be selected to participate and a further 100 placed on standby to replace any who fail to start the contest. This is the countrys largest event and much money is spent gambling on it. The General himself starts the event (I cannot call it a race) and makes a couple of  appearances further down as the contest develops.<br /><br />  The aim of the contest? To be the only one walking at the end. They begin on a highway and walk many miles through towns and cities, the destination unimportant. The story centers around contestant Ray Garraty and progresses as he develops friendships and bonds with fellow Walkers. The rules are simple...slow down under 4 miles an hour, stop or sit down and you receive a warning. Receive 3 warnings and any further violation will earn you a 'ticket' out of this world with a grisly death from the soldiers who escort and keep tabs on the Long Walkers on their journey. The winner is the last Walker left, who earns 'The Prize' of anything they want for the rest of their life.<br /><br />  The raw brutality of this is frightening enough but the real story deals with the 'whys' and why anybody would want to take part in this event in the first place. At the start they think they knew, but as The Walk progresses into the hundreds of miles and pain and fatigue and lack of sleep and fear set in, they rethink their whole philosophy on life and their reasons for doing this. Some make strong friendship bonds with fellow Walkers whilst others keep away from everybody to avoid losing friends. This book is about out inner strength to go on that comes from nowhere, when we've all but given up and all hope is lost but go on regardless, and the power of the human spirit. That's the real story I found here.<br /><br />The premise was a basic one but that wasn't what this book was about. It was about the human bonds we make and the choices we face, just when we have life all figured out and know what we want, we really don't have a clue.<br />  I gave it 4 stars, it lost a star for me because I think the ending could have been longer...it was good but needed more closure for me. All in all a very chilling and entertaining book.ers keep away from everybody to avoid losing friends.

B003XQM2YU|5.0|I liked the movie but it was a little frustrating. It ended where Robin Hood began and I really thought it should have kept going; although it had good graphics and story line. One of those that could have been longer. All in all it was worth the money for the movie.

And since that particular PC I put it in doesn't do heavy graphics or anything, the Build in Intel HD 2000 Graphics is more than plenty.<br /><br />Really though Intel Processors are usually worth there money anyways. They last forever and are powerhouses. Very good Brand in CPU's.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|the best angry birds yet.  I have it on my g2 phone and my Asus tablet.  I have the free version and have had no problems with it at all... just awesome game play.  for those of complaining, try updating your phone or tablet.  I am sure the game was optimized for newer devices.  Also, do you have problems with too many apps on your device?  try getting rid of some and see if that helps.
B008RC72G8|2.0|Big fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Deep and even bigger fan of Dark Shadows.  I had bad feelings about this movie when I saw the trailers, but thought I'd stay open minded.  Didn't go to the theater to see it after all of the bad reviews, but decided to rent it on Blu-ray when released.  Was not worth the wait.  Very disconnected from the original series, not the same mood or tone, characters totally different from the series.  Didn't mind it being up dated or re-imagined, but this mess of a film that did everything wrong.  Did the creator's ever see the original series?  The music from the series is iconic, but there was not a single refrain in the score.  Over the past 50 years Bond films, while being updated, retain something of the original. This film was more of a parody, more Saturday Night Live skit, than a new vision of Dark Shadows.  Complete waste of time!
B005XN31LY|4.0|It is a good TV series, but I recommend you start from the beginning rather than come into the middle of the series.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This was a great story, lots of plot twists and great characters but<br /><br />I hated how it ended.  The story ended in a way which wasn't an ending that was just or fair.  It ended in a phase that continue... don't you hate a story with a surprise '....to be continued'  ?  That's how this story ended.  I found the ending very unsatisfying, however the story was a great read...until the end.
B009H442DG|5.0|This album is the perfect thing to cuddle up to on this Christmas. I know when I'm eating my dinner of lunchables, and vodka while surrounded by my 5 cats \\"THIS CHRISTMAS\\" is what I'll be listening to. I'm glad I sold the last of my foodstamps for this wonderful Christmas extravaganza!
0060575913|4.0|Read more:[...]    I really wanted to love this book, especially considering how much I love Neil Gaiman and how much I enjoyed the movie.  I just didn't.  I liked it, I really liked it, but it didn't give me the tingly literary elation of Stardust or Neverwhere or The Graveyard Book.  The aesthetic is wonderful, and so is the writing.  Pure Gaiman, eerie and like an old timey story.  I think the hitch for me was in the plot.  It just went so fast.  I had expected a slower, more suspenseful introduction to the other mother's evil, but that revelation came right away and most of the book was spent trying to free the captive souls.  I would have liked to see a switch in emphasis.  That said, it's still classic and the concept is brilliant beyond measure.    plot . 4/5  It starts out perfectly, with a great eerie horror-story set-up.  Neglectful parents.  Girl goes exploring.  Strange things keep happening and suddenly she's in an eerie otherworld that seems in some ways too perfect, in other ways ghastly.  Here's where I thought it fell a little flat.  I wanted the reveal to be slower.  I didn't expect the other mother to reveal her true colors so quickly.  It made it feel less horrific to me that we were shown the truth so quickly.  So I didn't feel as invested in the end, because it just seemed to take such a long time.  I think it just peaked in its horror too quickly.  Not to say that it wasn't exciting.  I just have higher standards for Gaiman.    concept . 5/5  No complaints here.  The concept is brilliant and sadistic and unique in a way that Gaiman is so perfect at.  It takes every child's greatest desires and worst nightmares and rolls them into one.  Dolls and toys become sinister.  Freedom from parental control becomes terrifying.  It reminds me very much of old Are You Afraid of the Dark? episodes.  Want to come live with us, dear? says the eerie otherworldly parental figure.  Seems like a great idea...until she shows her teeth.  It's classic in ways, butGaiman gives it a darkly funny twist.    characters . 5/5  Gaiman's characters tend to be caricatures of reality that somehow seem perfectly real themselves.  I don't know how he does it and I envy him for it.  Coraline is the stereotypical little girl drawn to such epic proportions that she's totally believable.  Very Roald Dahl like, only with bite.  No recipes.  Day-glo gloves. Always wanting to be treated with more attention, fewer rules.  Her parents are exaggerated too--the absentminded adults who send their daughter out into the yard to play.  It's this that gives the story a lot of its dark fairy tale quality.  But exaggerated as they are, they're still relatable and so real-feeling.  You want to root for them.    style . 5/5  Gaiman's style is one of my favorites in literature.  Part fairy tale, part satire, witty and dark and elegant and eerie.  His pages are filled with sarcasm and poetry, silliness and the most beautifully vivid descriptions.  You feel like you're in a magical place from page one.  It manages to feel childishly whimsical and also very adult. Different ages of readers would all love and understand it, but they'd get very different things out of it.    mechanics . 5/5  Perfect, as always.  The addition of pictures makes it feel even more like an old woodcut fairy tale tome.    take home message  A dark modern fairy tale that waxes both horrific and whimsical.
0425263916|5.0|Book 2 was even more awesome than one and I didn't think that would be possible.. Love the story and can't wait for Book 3.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|timeless classic! Kevin Costner is amazing. I would recommend this movie to young and old alike. never goes out of style.
B008SGMPVU|1.0|I thought this would be humorous on a B movie level, it's not even Z level. To add insult to injury and a waste of money, there's obvious audio glitches near the end of the movie which makes me want to return or exchange it to verify if they left such a blatant correctable problem intact, It should be easy to fix such audio problems. It sounds like cables being unplugged or plugged into to a sound system while it's still on. The movie sucks, it begins with O'Bannon's disclaimer on how the movie was original intended to be funny upon it's (hard to believe it was ever released) release in theaters... and it mentions how he realized if he couldn't be funny and get laughs, he'd get screams and went on to work on Alien with Ridley Scott. He also states Alien was the scary version of this movie? his ego knows no bounds obviously.<br /><br />Avoid this, when the highlight of a movie is an alien pet that consists of a painted beach ball... yeah, save your money and spend it on a REAL HD modern Blu-ray movie of any quality over this drudge.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is a must read if you are a Grisham fan. A page turner--couldn't put it down. Never saw how it was going to end--really surprised.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I started watching Homeland late, last seaon. Love the show and worth buying the DVD, to catch up and to have. Fast paced interesting show.
B00984668E|4.0|This album brims with swagger and power... But not the full out hungry aggressiveness of Gods of the Earth or the lumbering muscle of Warp Riders. It contains all the elements of their previous efforts and I guess thats why i feel a little let down by the album... the guys seem to be playing it safe. Long story short I like the album very much and is another impressive notch to an already impressive pelt. But I can't help but be a little disappointed... The mix is pretty slick and raucous. The guitars crunch and scream and the drums seem a little more tame. But I miss the urgency, ferocity and lofi-ness. But that's just me.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series. If you're into zombies, drama, and zombies you'll be good to go. Very addictive and can't stop watching!
B008G59IKO|5.0|I thought Uno was great, but this album is far superior. It's a much more interesting and varied album. Nightlife is a great song! I know some fans will hate it because it has some Hip Hop / Pop influence in it. Personally, I love seeing a band that continues to take chances and try out new sounds. Can't wait for Tre!!!
B009GIPDQS|4.0|One of John Grisham's better novels of late. The plot twists and turns and surpris made it a really enjoyable read. The ending was a little abrupt, but overall a good read.
B0009P66TK|5.0|Bought this watch about two weeks ago. To start with, Amazon and UPS are awesome when it comes to shipping. Ordered it at 11 pm local time here i Sweden on Thursday. Monday morning at 10 am, the UPS delivery guy rang our doorbell! Its freakin faster than the Swedish postal service.<br /><br />The watch arrived in a nice looking box, The watch itself looks and feels great. Its a big, quite heavy watch (for being a watch with a leather strap) but that just makes it feel rugged and expensive.<br /><br />The 99$ price is a steal!<br /><br />I love it.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I was really looking forward to this latest book. To me it started off very slow with way too much detail. I thought it would never pick up. Then about 3/4 the way into the book it did get better but still, it wasn't one of her best. I even thought her last one was lacking also. I'm glad I read it because I want to keep up with her latest books but I was not thrilled with it. It wasn't a smooth read. Hopefully she can get out of this slump and write the good books like she did in her older ones. Just so so for me. Disappointed.
B004LRORES|5.0|I read this book about every ten years,  every time I find myself thinking that I wish it was required reading for every young person.  So much to be learned from it.

B0095R64AO|3.0|Many of the same plot elements from their previous movies show up in this movie - so if you like them as a team then you'll probably like this one.  It drags quite a bit in the center and I think it could have been improved significantly if it were shortened by about 30 minutes.  There are few laugh out loud moments and the supporting characters are really great.

0307720950|5.0|Chris Anderson does a stellar job of exploring the Maker Movement. Tying this current movement back to the \\"cottage industries\\" of England in the first industrial revolution helps you get an appreciation for just how impact-full this movement may be. This book resonates with me on three levels:<br /><br />I'm pushing my 14-year old to be more hands-on in his exploration of math, science and engineering concepts. He loves cars to the point that he thinks Google's robot cars are evil - \\"real men want to drive their own cars.\\" We've been listening to this book on my iPhone on the way to and from school each day. The sections of the book on Tesla and Local Motors hooked him in to the Maker concept! Now, I can't keep him off the Local Motors website and he is designing his own car (on paper anyway). A book that inspires a 14-year to be more interested in STEM is a great book!!!!!<br /><br />On a second level, I'm an electrical engineer with over 20 years of IC design experience. I'm now in marketing so I spend my days talking with really sharp people about how they can get their great ideas into one of my company's custom chips. But, most of my design at work is limited to PowerPoint. As a creative outlet, I'm a Maker. Chris's book contains great stories about other makers and if nothing else this book would serve as a great reference for anyone wanting to make things. The information is great for those simply making for the fun of it or those looking to turn Making into a business.<br /><br />Finally, and this is my highest compliment - I WANT TO STEAL EVERY GREAT IDEA IN THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Chris does a tremendous job of discussing how modern desktop manufacturing equipment like 3D printing and laser cutting have made it so that anyone can \\"make the atoms.\\" You don't have to have a product that is going to sell millions. Instead with the tools of the Maker Movement you can cost effectively make products in your garage or have them fabricated at inexpensive service houses and support production runs of tens, hundreds or thousands.<br /><br />I'm in the mixed-signal semiconductor industry where it costs millions to make a custom semiconductor or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). My company helps to cut those costs by up to 80% but a few hundred thousand dollars to make your own custom chip is still expensive compared to the advances that have been made in the mechanical desktop fabrication world thanks to these maker-like concepts and products.<br /><br />\\"Makers: The New Industrial Revolution\\" will be my guide book for making custom mixed-signal IC development as affordable as printed circuit board (PCB) development.

B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Great game. It makes you think. it is not quite as good as the angry birds series. Its different. It was hurt to try it.
1401324649|4.0|The book reminded me a the style and the story telling of the Forrest Gump which while I realize most people loved I did not.  I really do not find it very appealing when fictional characters find themselves at the center of historical events and in someways unknown to the rest of the world find that their behaviors had a major impact on the outcome.<br /><br />Jonasson wrote that basic premise, the character drifts through life and things seem to just happen to him and he doesn't seem to care.  The history was interesting, the perspective was funny, and I could overlook a few inaccuracies because of that.  I know the character is a 100 year old version of Forrest Gump but because his behavior and outlook were a choice and not the mental issues that Forrest faced it made more sense to me and in spite of myself I found myself laughing and would highly recommend that book.  It won't change your life but if very well could brighten up a weekend or so.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|This first book in the Kane Chronicles is certainly entertaining, with some of the high wit shown in the Riordan's Olympus books.  Fun to see someone taking on Egyptian mythology from this perspective.  The narrative lurches around a bit, but settles down to a satisfactory climax.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Truthfully i have read other reviews of this film that stated THIS WAS NOT A SPIN OFF OF ALIEN<br />EXCUSE ME but i disagree IT DARN WELL IS A SPIN OFF OF ALIEN .<br />your entitled to your opinion of course but i saw the story line during the first few minutes.<br />The film was visually stunning and beautifully done but right off the bat i saw the similarities and the story line was there artfully hidden but still there.<br />as the film progressed i enjoyed the interplay of unusual characters and i truly enjoyed the surreal mysterious story as it unfolded  alien you betcha it is, but also unique in its own right yes very much so!!  worth a look most definitely i think you may just enjoy the film .
0446580848|1.0|Enough with the lame Corey remarks to every single thing that is said or happens in this book. The book could be half its size if remarks edited out. I'd hate to meet this guy.

B007C3TVEY|2.0|Art films often require that a chance be taken on the part of the audience. I think that this is why audiences sometimes avoid them; when you buy a ticket to The Amazing Spider-Man, you more or less know what you're getting. When you buy a ticket to The Tree of Life, you're taking a chance on something that reaches farther and may, as a result reward you more. I took such a chance recently with We Need to Talk about Kevin, and unfortunately, the chance was punishing.<br /><br />We Need to Talk about Kevin stars Tilda Swinton as Eva, at the bottom of a downward spiral. She's living alone, overmedicated, drunken, her community hates her, and her son Kevin is in prison. Through flashbacks, we see how she got here. Kevin was conceived through a passionate commencement of what was most likely destined to be an affair. Her husband Franklin is played by John C. Reilly, and we see fragments of her life with Kevin, as he is a baby, again when he's 6, and then when he's 16. We see the signs of a tragedy on the horizon, and I won't spoil what that is for you; you can figure it out pretty easily.<br /><br />There is ample material here for a powerful drama, but We Need to Talk about Kevin squanders its potential. The first mistake that the movie makes is that it lacks any semblance of conflict. Little Kevin is evil. No, I mean REALLY evil. As a baby, he cries constantly, but only at Eva. As a 6-year-old, he refuses to communicate with her and provokes her into breaking his arm (trust me on this one). As a teenager, he's openly hostile. There's a single scene that seems to suggest that they will finally get along, but the movie suddenly resumes its unending stream of cruelty to Eva.<br /><br />While this does stretch plausibility, the bigger problem is that it makes the movie completely predictable. We Need to Talk about Kevin may not be intended as psychologically realistic, but any kind of fiction needs a possibility that its events will turn out more than one way. Here, we see the ending coming a mile away because there's nothing to suggest anything else will happen. The third act of the film holds a fair amount of power as is, but because it's inevitable, it doesn't matter.<br /><br />The second problem is the movie's style. I know, I know, art films need to be bold, but were We Need to Talk about Kevin a mainstream horror film, the crushingly obvious choice of soundtrack and endlessly recurrent use of the color red would be criticized as amateurish. Shots draw attention to themselves, like when Eva, pregnant, walks down a hallway as a group of young ballerinas run past her. We get it.<br /><br />The praise I can laud upon the film is hampered by these last two points. Tilda Swinton is a magnificent actress, and she's as good here as she is anywhere else. John C. Reilly and Ezra Miller are also effective. And the style, while annoying, is basically technically competent. But a movie needs more than good performances; it needs a world that we can believe in, and that's where We Need to Talk about Kevin fails. If you want to see Tilda doing great work in a better movie, check out Julia.

Those wonderful women that took Snow White and the Huntsman in - Where were the men?  Why were they gone?  No remorse for the Wicked Witch?

B007V65R54|4.0|Truth be told... I'm a data geek.<br /><br />Mr. Silver did a great job going over the hurdles that one must face when doing predictions with data analytics in a very easy to understand writing style.  His real world examples, applicable to current events, is spot on.  This is an excellent read for the analyzer as well as the person who relies on the analysis (marketers, c-level execs, etc...).<br /><br />I purchased this book before the elections and was eagerly watching the FiveThreeEight blog for their predictions and outcomes.  Amazingly, every state was predicted in the Presidential election accurately.  This adds an amazing amount of credence to Mr. Silver's insights.<br /><br />The only reason why I did not rate five stars is that over time, this book may lose some of its relevancy when comparing with recent events.  If there was a 4 1/2 stars or 4 3/4 stars option, I would have happily chosen one of those.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed in this purchase.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|Clay Jannon is one of those people that rarely touch paper. Need news? He uses Google. Looking for a job? He scans the job openings online. Looking for something to read? He downloads books, magazine articles, blog posts to his laptop or his early version Kindle. He is a child of the internet and his job is at a startup, creating logos, web sites, administering a Twitter account. However, a severe downturn in the economy results in the loss of Clay's job. He's been out of work for a year, there is nothing in San Francisco for him; he is a dime a dozen.<br /><br />It is paper that gets him a job.<br /><br />Because he cannot concentrate on actually finding a job while he is online, one link sends him to another site, then to another until his entire day is shot and he is no closer to finding a job. What he does to combat the internet is to print out the want ads and take a walk around San Francisco while reading his printouts. Strangely, that does not help him land a job. But San Francisco is an interesting place, as he discards his latest printouts, he sees a \\"Help Wanted\\" sign in the window of Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore. \\"What the heck,\\" he says, walks in and interviews for the job of the night clerk at the store. He is hired.<br /><br />This is not an ordinary book store. While they have some popular books, the store is dedicated to different kinds of books, strange books. Which are loaned out to a wide variety of people who arrive at the store at all hours of the day and night. Curious, Clay takes a look at some of them; they appear to be written in some sort of code.<br /><br />Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore is an incredible balance between \\"new\\" and \\"old.\\" While books are the primary focus, Robin Sloan incorporates new technologies, such as Google, OCR, crowd sourcing, and more. Old Knowledge, that which is not indexed on a search server, has a definite place in the world and is very much relevant. In addition to the wonderful characters and excellent plot, it is this balance that allows the novel to soar. Sloan really shines when he focuses on Clay, a man who may live a technical world but, underneath his web-centric world, really likes pen and ink. The reader recognizes this early, but enjoys the ride as Clay discovers this for himself. And it's not because Clay is a Luddite at heart. He really has a deep appreciation of the glue, the feel, the smell of books (and bookstores) and ink. Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore is a fabulous page turner that is very appealing; it is very hard to put down. It is also one of those books what will remain with you long after you have powered down your e-reader or marked your place.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained from: Amazon<br />Payment: Purchased

B0076DCT2G|1.0|I used to always look forward to reading Nelson DeMille's books.  They were always well written and had an exciting plot.  I consider Up Country one of the best books I have read.<br /><br />However, I have significant problems with his newest book The Panther.  The plot is slow and tiresome and John Corey has become stale and rather irritating.  But, I'm afraid the biggest take away from the book is that it is nonstop racial slurs about Arabs.  John Corey (Nelson DeMille) seems to not be able to help himself uttering the worst racial stereotypes against Arabs.  It appears to me the book is a compendium of Nelson DeMille's racist comments about Arabs.  If Nelson DeMille thinks educated people enjoy reading his racist views in his books he must be demented.  Maybe he should change his name to Nelson DeMented.<br /><br />I've rated this book one star because that is the lowest rating I can give it.

NOTHING ever goes wrong and it will infuriate anyone who has owned (or managed) a business.<br /><br />The book basically follows a pattern -<br />Chapter one - They make a fantastic search engine (google) and everyone loves it; their profesors tell them to make a company of it.<br />Chapter two - A friend loves their search engine and offer to financially start the company if they can have 50% of the shares - this is rejected because google believe they can get more money and they want full control.<br />Chapter three - A private investor offers them more money but wants 50% share - this is rejected because google believe they can get more money and they want full control.<br />Chapter four - A group of financial investors offer them a fantastic amount of money for 50% share - this is rejected because google believe they can get more money and they want full control.<br />Chpater five - A group of financial investors offer them a gigantic amount of money for a minor share - this is rejected because google believe they can get more money and they want full control.<br />By the end of the book they finally accept so much money (Over a Billion dollars) and they keep full control of the company.<br /><br />During all this they do not hit one roadblack, not one single thing ever goes wrong!!!  This drove me personally insane as I have started my own business and had it go under because of things beyond my control (don't get me wrong, I've started other businesses and stuffed them up without any outside help!).<br /><br />Wether this story is accurate or not it should never have been published as it has no conflict (except people having a conflict to see who can throw the most money at it and others battling each other to tell them how great the search engine is), no 'battling the odds' or personal struggles.<br /><br />If I could give this book -5 stars I would; and yes I did read it to the end to see if they hit any obstacles on their way to the top - they didn't.them how great the search engine is), no 'battling the odds' or personal struggles.<br /><br />If I could give this book -5 stars I would; and yes I did read it to the end to see if they hit any obstacles on their way to the top - they didn't.

I LOVE THAT IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM ( VERY FEW) all you have to do is go to help and leave your phone number and in A instant help call you and fix your problem. MANAGING MY BOOKS IS SO EASY WITH KINDLE AND GOING TO THE LIBRARY AND RETURNING THEM WITH THIS APP IS GREAT.LOVE MY KINDLE FOR ANDROID.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Glad I purchased the Kindle version from Amazon.com. because it made me rethink a few things.  But I wouldn't consider it a \\"must read.\\"  I already believe in Heaven and this book didn't prove or disprove that belief.  I don't think it would convince any nonbeliever.
1451613512|5.0|What a brilliant book! Perfectly researched and expertly told. I am buying it for everyone on my Christmas list.<br /><br />This is Oliver Stone's best work yet.
0545425115|3.0|Just imagine yourself as the author of Hunger Games and you have been given the directions to write the hunt to the death for the 24 children using primarily present day advances in technology and not some of the bizarre or beyond all possible coincidence scenes and effects that we were subjected to. Hey you writers out there; of course you could do it and I submit that it could have been a much finer novel and left you with a much scarier and realistic feeling.<br /><br />Like feeling: \\"Wow, this could really have happened.\\"<br /><br />Also, if there were an opportunity to rewrite, I would have put it in first person past point of view and not first person present and, most importantly, I would have included some chapters in some of the other characters point of view. That opportunity was lost staying in first person present with the protagonist for the entire book. Also the ending got a little fuzzy with the evil president that the author never really followed up on. And one always feels a little cheated by an abrupt ending that is primarily a promo for the next book in the series and doesn't satisfactorily end this book.<br /><br />It's still a good book; it just could have been better.
0316228532|1.0|This book is shear poison.  Imagine a whole cast of characters like aunt petunia and uncle Vernon.  This is a mean spirited dig at British society, bitter and profane.  It made me depressed the whole time I was reading it and I intend to destroy it so no one else will suffer through it. A big disappointment, I will never buy a book she wrote again. don't waste your money.
1419705849|4.0|As a school librarian, I love the Diary of a Wimpy kid series. They are funny, and the kids want to read them over and over, which is awesome. I was eager to read the newest edition, especially since I knew it would be about a school dance. I know Greg is in middle school, but fans of the books are as young as first grade. I wanted to see how the topic was handled, but I should have known the dance would be more about Greg's mishaps than romance.<br /><br />Although it's not the best book in the series, I still enjoyed the latest Greg drama--getting locked in the laundry room while babysitting, having his mom come to school to make him take off his jacket, and even Greg getting kicked out of kindergarten. And that's all before the senior citizens crash the dance. Each situation is humorously written, and fans will enjoy getting to know a little bit of Greg's past while seeing him worm his way out of his current predicament.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that mention the topics jump around, and while I thought the beginning of the book that compared Greg's childhood to Manny's was a little long, I thought Kinney tied the ending back to the beginning, which was a nice touch and great conclusion to the story.<br /><br />Fans of the story, both young and old, will enjoy this latest book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A bit of Forest Gump meets the old folks home.  The adventures of the 100 year old man has a dark side... but in a light sort of way. There are laugh out loud portions... The cast of characters will keep you wondering what will happen next.  I will read this book again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I enjoy puzzle type games that get your mind working. That being said this game is pretty simple to get at the onset until you make your way up to the more difficult levels that are larger and have more dots to connect. Fun little time waster that is not as challenging as say Sudoku, but is worth the time.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|After watching a performance of Wicked at ASU Gammage I knew I had to get the soundtrack so we could relive the best show we've seen to date. I am no theatre buff or music aficionado, all I know is that the show and the music rocks! Any time that music can paint a picture in your head or get you emotional you know that the composer and performers have done their job. My wife and I will sing the songs periodically because they're as much fun to sing as they are to listen to. Even if you haven't seen the show (I would recommend it if you can) and enjoy good music I would definitely purchase this.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was excited to read this new book and intrigued by the plot description.  It started out strong, and about 1/3 of the way in, the author gives over, in my opinion, to over-use of foul lanuage.  That type of language can be great to make a point or convey a range of sentiment, but when it is every other word, then I felt like it was distracting and took away from the over effect of the plot.  Would have been better with foul language in moderation.

1432794426|5.0|I've read a lot of books which gave us an inside look into the life of Michael Jackson but never have I come across a book which took you this in-depth in the portrayal of Michael Jackson until I picked up this book by Dr. Karen Moriarty which really does the King justice.<br /><br />This book which even covers his controversial problems, paints the picture of the man how I, and many have always believed him to be.<br /><br />This book \\"Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy\\" is one of the best books dealing with Michael Jackson out today period. While some may argue that there wasn't enough research done on this book it's become very clear that Dr. Karen Moriarty really worked hard in trying to capture as much of the life of the gloved one as possible.<br /><br />A Stunning 500 page book that really tried to showcase as much as it could of the life he lived without having had first hand experience herself she relied on first hand accounts from people who actually knew Michael.<br /><br />If you ever want to read a book which not only tells it how it was!<br /><br />But also acts as a great way to bring justice to the king of pop. Then this is the book for you.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for all Michael Jackson fans.
B004GJNFHG|5.0|This film was not just an ordinary piece of cinematography. It was poetry, each scene a work of art that only Steve McQueen could pull off. The long silences and actions carrying the story along and making you ponder every word you just said. Michael Fassbender should have won awards for this as well as every other cast member. I am mystified by this piece and will watch it many more times. I would recommend this to anyone in the world that truly appreciates cinematography and art.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a fantastic Marvel movie...one of the very best ever!  It is a fun ride that everyone will enjoy!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was good but I was glad to come to the end of the trilogy.  Enough was enough and I was entertained by the three books.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|\\"Proof of Heaven\\" is a very intense and moving account of the author's near-death experience.  While he was in a coma for 7 days, he visited the Underworld and Heaven itself.  As a medical doctor and well educated in current science, he is well qualified to comment on the technical aspects of his physical condition during the near death experience.  The book should encourage all people to believe that there is more waiting for us after this life.

B009KYXEY6|5.0|This is an outstanding album, and a suitable follow-up to her spectacular Born To Die from earlier in the year. The tracks are less over-produced thus allowing her voice to shine through. The most spectacular tracks for me are Ride, American and Cola.<br /><br />However as has already been noted by many customers, the deluxe album for Born To Die in this package is missing three tracks. As I already have the BTD album with the 12 tracks, the only reason I bought this was for those 3 tracks. Therefore to sell a CD without them included is fraud. This needs to be corrected by Interscope as soon as possible (maybe exchange the defective CDs for the correct one).
B000TJBNFI|5.0|I think this is my favourite movie from the master Stephen King, and the Kathy Bates performance is superb. Excellent Movie !
1455519006|5.0|Baldacci is always great at creating suspense.  The addition of the resourceful, young, suspicious girl added a very touching twist.  As I age (I'm 74) I find myself tearing up more easily.  This occurred several times in my reading.
630460288X|5.0|I love this movie, great special effects and great story.  Stallone, Snipes and Bullock, great actors.  This is a representative movie from the 90s.
1419705849|5.0|While I haven't read this book (or the series) myself personally, I have to love a book that my son gets at 3pm on the day it comes out - and reads 120 pages nonstop in that same evening!<br /><br />Jeff Kinny nailed it on the head when he created Greg Heffley and his family & friends.  My son is in 3rd grade and has enjoyed these books for almost a year.  They were the first \\"chapter\\" books that he showed any interest in and I've been very happy that my son will read them without my begging him (like some books).

B001HNE3NO|3.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" is a compelling read. After reading it, I'll never look at France the same way. It's a real page-turner, but be prepared for devastation. For four nights, I found it hard to sleep; images from this book kept jolting me awake. If you can get past the worst, however, you'll be glad you finished it. There's some sense of closure at the end.<br /><br />Even Eli Wiesel's book, \\"Night,\\" didn't touch me as much as this did.

B0076794IO|4.0|This book has everything you want from a thriller: easy to read, pacy and unpredictable. Pavone makes good use of non-chronological order to keep the reader hooked. The big action is happening 'today', but each chapter has only a snippet of today's events and then it jumps back to a previous time. This builds suspense as you want to keep reading to find out what's happening.<br /><br />Each of the four main characters has a deep secret. As Kate is trying to unravel the details of her husband's seemingly unethical world, she desperately tries to keep a lid on her own dark past.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Joe B. is the best in the world. Buy this dvd and find out. If you are a guitar rock/R&B fan is does not get any better than Joe Bonamassa.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I read all three books.Loved them all!~ I thought the first two of the series were more interesting and easier to read. The third was alittle confusing at times with the flashbacks and all. But all in all a great read.
B0095R64AO|3.0|The movie was cute but there was 20 minutes at least that could've been cut there near the end. The ending is predictable and it just gets prolonged with unnecessary details. It was not as \\"laugh out loud hilarious\\"as I expected but it had some good moments. I'm glad I watched it but its not near the top of my \\"watch again\\" list.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Loved how the author Kathleen Grissom used two narrators. I am presenting this to my book club for our next read. Kathleens writing was beautiful, fell in love with the characters. Bravo! Thank you

B004LWZWGK|5.0|Years after thwarting the Joker, Bruce Wayne sits alone in his mansion, his body derelict from abuse and neglect, his days as a crime fighter spent after taking the blame for Harvey Dent's crimes and death. Life in Gotham has gone on, safe and prosperous without the Batman. All of this is shattered by the arrival of Bane, a new leader in the League of Shadows. Young, determined, and unbelievably strong, Bane is more than a match for Batman, and aims to succeed where Bruce Wayne refused to act: in destroying Gotham City painfully and absolutely. Beaten, bankrupted, and betrayed, Batman will face his greatest challenge: saving a city ruled by his enemies from itself.<br /><br />Let's get the obvious question out of the way first. Rises is not as good as The Dark Knight. In fact Heath Ledger owned the Joker so thoroughly it's hard to imagine ANY Batman film topping it. But in a way, Dark Knight's success was also a shortcoming: so dominated was it by its villian that Batman himself felt like a supporting character. Rises, by contrast, is soundly a Batman film, and its dives into the hero's psyche (and his bone-crunching fights) are as exciting and compelling here as they were in Batman Begins, if not more so. This is supported by excellent development of characters like Commissioner Gordon and newcomer Catwoman (who is not CALLED Catwoman in the film, since one silly animal-person name is already pushing it in these dark masterpieces).<br /><br />Rises also feels like a move between the Nolan cinematic universe and the comic books. All the Hitchcockian darkness of the past two films remains firmly in place, but the action is a bit more over the top, as armies of criminals with futuristic weapons war openly against the police. Nolan's Batman films have always presented themselves as the building of the Batman mythos and this movie does a fine job showing the ultimate outcome of that movement. The resulting film is tense, exciting, and menacingly larger than life- the best way to describe it is as a combination of the climax of Avengers and the siege of Stalingrad, the second component being pretty obviously intentional.<br /><br />So Rises succeeds at being a great Batman film and a solidly tense action thriller as well. However, if it has any failing it is that it leans on the comic books and other Nolan films far more than its predecessors. Still, this only means that to best enjoy it you should watch the whole trilogy- by no means a bad thing. It is also less solid than its forebearers: why does Batman waste his time erecting a flaming bat-symbol atop a bridge? Why does a city full of criminals willingly follow Bane? And yes, Tom Hardy is very hard to hear through (the audio filter of) his mask. But these weak points do not ruin the film- it starts at such a high tier that at its worst it still stands with the best releases of the year.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Excellent performances from a great cast; Anne Hathaway in particular nails Catwoman to a tee<br />-Builds the Nolan Batman franchise to an insane crescendo befitting its epic earlier episodes<br />-Brings Batman back to the fore in a solid way<br />-Brilliant set design, costumes, and soundtrack create an innovative and eerie world that befits the grim, terse story<br />-Surprisingly affordable for a new release of a major hollywood picture in high def<br /><br />CONS<br />-Convoluted plot has more than a few holes<br />-About half of Bane's lines are really hard to hear since his voice blends into background noise easily<br />-Lacks the panic and rough psychological hit of The Dark Knight<br /><br />STUFF TO WATCH FOR<br />-Batman's final battle to dispose of a huge spherical bomb with an obvious timing mechanism is more than a little reminiscent of Adam West's similar quest in the 60s film, so much so that it almost must be deliberate<br />-One of Bane's League enforcers is played by Chris Judge, formerly of Stargate. Yay Teal'c!<br />-Doctor Crane makes another return cameo in this film, making him the only Batman Rogue to appear in all three Nolan films. And his cameo is AWESOME.
1936608618|5.0|I've used the concepts from this book myself and with numerous athletes with excellent results.  The chapters on technique training for running, cycling and swimming are easy to follow and the flexibility chapter provide great advice and stretches to make you into a supple leopard (is that trademarked?).  The programming section provides a 12 week plan that will definitely get you ready for most any event at about 6-8 hours a week of training.  I highly recommend this for any athlete looking to train for endurance events while incorporating a strength and conditioning program without having to invest a substantial amount of time training.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I couldn't stop watching the show. Incredible writing and plot. Very intense. Well developed characters. It's a fast-paced suspense with ever-changing plot.
B008HK3XYK|3.0|I bought this case when I bought the KF. Great case, but I cannot figure out why the auto sleep/wake is not working. I went so far as to email the Marware about two weeks ago and got zero reply. Going to have to talk with Amazon to figure out if it's the case or the kindle itself. It's very frustrating since the power button is so small on the KF and I'm tired of fussing around with it.<br /><br />Otherwise case is well made. I wish it had a strap on the back to hold it with one hand since the KF is actually pretty heavy. One reviewer said it this case was awkward to hold, I'd agree with that. But it's lightweight, stylish, well padded and it fits perfectly.
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|I thought this was a solid movie from beginning to end. It's gruesome and real and full of heart. It doesn't take the easy way out, it's not trite or filled with cliches. There are no false notes. And I absolutely loved Kelly Willis in it.
0756407125|4.0|As a rule, I don't reference other reviews. But I'll make an exception here because the review by James M. Bennett  on March 6, 2011 says it all. And far more eloquently than I can.<br /><br />This book is a mess. A vastly entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable mess, but a mess nonetheless. The story lurches forward in odd bursts, and at the end you know not much more than when you began. I expect all will be \\"tidied up\\" in the 3rd book, but it's a bit aggravating in the meantime. For the record, I have no particular problem with Kvothe's foray into sex with a faerie queen. Sounds good to me. Heh. Still, he's supposed to be a young man in his late teens - of COURSE sex is going to be part of his life. I read somewhere that a person thinks about sex once every 15 minutes or something. My late teens were a while ago, but I'm pretty sure it was once (or twice) every 15 SECONDS. Just saying.<br /><br />I also have one other minor complaint about the martial tutelage Kvothe's receives from the Ademre (and be advised, this is epic nit-picking on my part): the author clearly has no personal experience of 1) war or 2) edged weaponry. I have a bit of both, courtesy of Uncle Sam. Kvothe's teacher gets very angry due to his flippant statement about using a sword. I got irked about the whole \\"that's not the point of learning to use a sword\\" bit. A sword is a weapon to kill people. Period. You can't hunt with it. You can't build a house with it. And, no, you DO NOT cut wood with a sword - the balance, weight, and edge are all wrong for wood. It is a tool that makes killing people easier. Pretending otherwise is not only foolish, it could be fatal. I realize the point was to drive home the idea that you shouldn't use a sword lightly or carelessly, but the message got messed up along the way. A trainer of warriors should know better than to get pissed at a student for recognizing the ultimate purpose of a sword is to kill others. The cause may be just or unjust, but that doesn't change the function of the steel.<br /><br /> Anyway, enough ranting from me. Buy the book. Read the book. Swear loudly. Then wait for the third one like the rest of us. ;)

B0070XB0N6|5.0|Fun, frightening, and beautifully written. I always try to read the book before the movie, and this one did not disappoint. It reminds me of Gaimon's The Graveyard Book; check that one out also!
0985081821|3.0|This book was well written and well edited. It was interesting but not a page turner. I wasn't up until 2am because I needed to finish it. It's one of the better books I've read in the paranormal/urban fantasy category but certainly not the best. It doesn't hold a candle to Discovery of Witches by Harkness. However, I will give the next book in this series a try. Maybe it will capture my attention more than the first.
1407130293|5.0|This series is incredible. Each book is an easy read, but will stay in your mind for days after you are finished. Many have seen the movie, which is excellent as well, but doesn't do justice to Katniss' inner monologue and dynamic development throughout the series. While the concept of the book seems barbaric at first, it is chilling to think about the fact that if we as a society become desensitized to one another's pain, this kind of horrific event could be in our future. A must read for everyone.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was an ending, but not the best in the trilogy. Worth the read, but don't expect the same level of thrill as the first two. However, I am sure that it would have been very challening to keep the pace of the first two without leaving the world of (even moderate) believability.
B009CAAQIA|4.0|With enough material in Ztt's vault to keep the Fgth catalogue afloat for years to come , we're blessed with yet another best of ,just in time for xmas. In short ,this one has a better sound than most of the previous ones and features rarer alternate mixes to the 7\\" singles . This one's definitely a keeper !
B0099114WO|2.0|This movie could have been so much better. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones did a fine job portraying believable middle-aged characters along with Steve Carrell playing a sympathetic counselor. As far as an empty marriage requiring a 180 degree change, it was a believable plot line until their therapy only involved sex work with some really stupid juvenile tips that will bring on cringe-inducing moments. Rather than make a movie for 'grown ups', this production devolved into yet ANOTHER story built around SEX. Very tiresome when this had makings of greatness and could've been 90 minutes of marital counseling for the masses but instead was built around teenage fantasies for old people and how to rekindle sex at age 60 like an 18 year old. More gross than funny, let me tell you!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I could never get too interested in these characters.  Perhaps it is best for those living in England.  Maybe next adult book will be better.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|awesome movie, Robert downy Jr. does an excellent job as well as the other actors. Also I noticed that this movie ties you into the movie Thor and the Avengers
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Marvels The Avengers? Very simple - best super hero movie EVER MADE! An excellent ensemble cast, an amazing script and action packed special effects through out.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan never ceases to amaze us with her extraordinary interpretative style! She sings so effortlessly and beautiful, I believe every notes that she sings! These set of songs are so perfect for Susan, she brings them to life! Susan Boyle is one Classy and Elegant Lady, everything she does is extraordinary and magnificent! God bless you Susan, you have made the World a more beautiful place! Strongly recommend this album to everyone!
B009LL4LMM|1.0|This game wants to start at boot, access storage outside of its sandbox, and have full internet access.  Sounds like the basic formula for mining private data. No way to tell if the dev has ill intent,  but for a game the perms are unnecessarily evil.  Passing on this one.<br />Fix the permissions and I might give this another look.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love playing this game!  Gets frustrating because it can be challenging, but I guess that is what makes it a game! :)
0312962118|5.0|I have just finished Snow Wolf and what a great read. This is not my normal genre but once I started it I could not put it down and was up till 3AM one morning. It is a long book and not one you can finish in a couple of reads but Glenn has a wonderful way of bringing all the characters to life where you want to know what happens to them. I found it enthralling and just did not want to put it down. There are enough twists and turns which make it believable but also enough where you are not sure what is going to happen. I have read some great books recently but this book is way up there and an excellent story. I have no problems in recommending it to your readers.
B007HACDLK|1.0|I've started AGAIN buying books at Costco because Amazon is going nuts with their prices for Kindle books. If we all do that maybe the price would come down.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Johnny Depp was good but not as good as his other movies.It has funny parts not as you expect from him.
B0085RZGYU|1.0|I have been a Baldacci fan for years and picked up Hell's Corner because of his name.  I can only say that he must have written this book some weekend when he could not pay the bill on his summer home.  This book is so lame I had trouble finishing it.  The Camel Club was brought in for no apparent reason and his nemisis was not well rounded.  This book should have embarassed him that it ever got published.  There were so many cliche's and absolute crap in this so called novel that I will probably not pick up one of his books again.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Very well written. Very quick and fun read. Got me rethinking how I run and train. Plan on reading it again.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Yes, I am a huge fan of Harry Potter. Yes, I knew it was not a children's book. Yes, I found it difficult to begin and to sustain through the first portion of the book. Yes, I found it immensely good after I got into it. I knew going into this novel it was not a children's book. I was also, for some reason, expecting a mystery type book (this isn't), and that, too was difficult to work through as I began to read the book on its own merit.  It is hard, though, to distance yourself from Rowling as Harry's creator and Rowling as the voice of Pagford. However, I really reminded myself that it was a different book with a different purpose and if I kept reading I would find something of merit. Was I ever right. I am amazed at Rowling's ability to distance herself from children's literature and write a very adult novel using very adult language and themes. It was a huge break from the past and one that took bravery and daring to write. I was also amazed at the development of the characters and the plot lines. Each character had a unique and distinct voice. I think what was difficult for me at first was keeping them all separate, however, once they are all introduced and you are moved between them and among them and introduced to each of them through the other characters, I was amazed at the intricacy with which it was written. As far as writer's craft goes, it is excellent. As the plot continues to unfold, Rowling continues to tie one person's observations and interpretations into another character's reality...and let me say...they are not always one and the same. Truly, things are not as they appear in Pagford, and the necessity of \\"keeping up appearances\\" hides a lot of pain and misery. No, it is not a happy book (although there are moments of lightheartedness and wit), but just because it is not happy and does not sugar coat reality does not make it any less compelling. It took me a long time to read it. I began in September when it came out and I just finished in mid-November. Mainly because the beginning was difficult for me to sustain. Once I determined I was going to go back to it, and got past all the introductions, it flew and I finished the remaining 2/3 in just a couple of days (my reading time is limited). If you are a Harry fan, please try to separate yourself from the other series. If you give the book a chance on its own merit, you may be surprised at how involved you become in empathizing with (or hating) some of the characters. I am convinced to go back and re-read the beginning, now that I am more in touch with the characters...I will enjoy it more the second time around. The 4 stars are because of the slow beginning. The remaining was a 5.ovember. Mainly because the beginning was difficult for me to sustain.

0882709194|5.0|I picked up the book and it changed the way i view everything...i mean everything. why does the media hide this kind of stuff from us? it's a healthy process to think through your worldview and this certainly challenged me...I have to wonder why stuff like this was never brought to my attention sooner...
B0085776BG|5.0|Very good movie which held my interest and I learned new interesting information.  Always glad to find a new good movie.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|For anyone with a 3D TV this is a must have! The 3D effects are the best I've seen & I actually think that the 3D is just as good as the theater. If you are a fan of Avatar you will not be disappointed.
B000SW4DJO|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE ;) Best movie ever! It can take a while to load but other than that its good!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|I could not stop watching this movie! It carries you away from the first moments and holds you captive to the wowww ending. Everything a movie should be... enjoy!
B00846REIS|3.0|I just cant get sucked in the the charactors like the auther wanted me to. It felt like a poor mans 50 shades of grey!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I loved this book! Its very well written and it kept me reading on and on , I couldn't stop reading.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So addicting!! I love this game! Just like at the arcade but cheaper! Finally I can feed my coin dozer. addiction without spending tons of money!
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie has more going for it than the trailers give it credit for.<br /><br />First Glance:<br />At first glance you expect mindless action with zero plot.<br /><br />Reality:<br />Awesome action and just enough plot and good characters to make this enjoyable from beginning to end.<br /><br />Classic Hollywood entertainment...I love it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I'm not even 1/4 of the way in to this book and I'm getting a feeling that Vince Flynn did not write this book. Vince Flynn is my favorite author of all time and Mitch Rapp is my favorite fictional character ever. Ive read all the other books in this series twice. I know the flow of the words.....I know mitch's mannerisms....I'm just not getting those with this book. Don't let my opinion keep u from buying this book. Ive never written a review but just felt compelled to do so with this book. Mitch Rapp is The Man.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My daughter loved this movie and so did I! The best part of this movie was the strong mother daughter bond and strong female role model. Not a typical princess story!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son is 2 years old and loves this app. It is a combination of fun puzzles and images they love; trucks, trains, planes, boats, etc..
0316010669|1.0|This \\"book\\" is written as a 10 year old would write an essay.<br /><br />Not worth the price.<br /><br />It's cr*p. Completely useless.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Might have started a little slow, but by the end I couldn't put it down. I appreciated the plot twists, how the author keeps the reader on our toes, without seeming trite. Would highly recommend, and appreciate the fact that the publisher has allowed me to loan this to my wife. 5.5 for being able to do that!
B00004XQ83|5.0|Not only did the CD contain all the old time Christian music seen in the movie, but it also had a screen saver that is so fun.  It plays the banjo, rings a cow bell, and multiple other goodies that making computing more fun.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the worst, I would give this movie a 9.5 It it truly an original.<br />I was quite surprised seeing the vampire from True Blood be a captain of a ship.<br />If you have not seen this film, the graphics alone are worth it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great read, not as good as the first though. Did not want to put it down, but regretted the ending.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|It's inspiring the amount of passion and mastery they have of their instruments and the music they play. It's truly moving to listen to their music and feel the emotion put into every song!!!
B000SVZIGC|4.0|A great movie for younger children all the way up to teen years. Daughter and father watched it together and both enjoyed it.
B008458O3S|5.0|I've had a hard time putting this game down. Breezed through the first half-dozen towns until I hit 'Spiced' in Guelph. Ouch. Have taken multiple cracks at it, but I'm just not getting it right. Ah well ... at least I can skip it, hit the next town, and come back later. Is it later already? OK, going to try that one again.<br /><br />Updated review ... finished the game, only to find that I unlocked a bunch of bonus puzzles. Whoa! And they are HARD! Knocked out 5 so far, and am sweating at the rest that I can access.<br /><br />Added note ... this game has a wonderful feature of automatically saving your unfinished work. Very cool to come back to a board and continue on the tracks where you left off.<br /><br />This might be my favorite Android game.
B008OOYALE|5.0|sweet and fun. u don't need real money to enjoy. I love naming each dragon myself. reallly fun and really cute
B009LL4LMM|4.0|Reminds me a LOT of Shark Dash, except that this game is a bit easier. However, it didn't hold my interest for very long. I went through about 30 boards before the redundancy of them kicked in and made me get off my butt to make breakfast.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|At least if I had used my credit on renting Battleship I would have got what was expected, explosions. Instead, I opted for manufactured situations and not enough death and gore. Please, save your time and buy the special edition Battle Royale blu-ray set.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Every time I try to save to the gallery, it never ends up saving. fix please! nexus 7 here with all latest updates installed. hasn't ever worked for me.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|My six year old really likes this game.  it starts out easy and then progresses into more difficult stages.<br />really makes him (and me) think and use strategy.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love the game but it keeps locking and crashing dumping my settlement and despite three emails I cant get any help to fix it. so don't get to attached to what you build.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|a very nice compliment to the angry birds space.  My 6 year old is hooked anyway on angry birds and this<br />was a very nice addition to challenge him.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought this book started of great and blended back in where the second book left off, but I didn't like the way it ended, it was a little predictable to me. It is a great story though and actually gives a person alot to think about. i do like the fact that at the end she ended up having children of her own though.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Well, your not going to rent this movie for the plot, nor or you going to rent this video because you think it will win the academy best picture nomination. Its pure eye candy. Enough said.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book, it picks up right where the first one left off and spins an even more intrigueing tale! with some unexepected turns of events too!
B008MEM24S|4.0|Great game. I even like to play it. Help to make the child think ahead. I was hesitant on buying this but it is worth the money.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|This book is very different. I really enjoyed it. I have a son who is schizophrenic and mental illness seems to overlap. Funny sad book very true could relate to all of it.
B009LL4LMM|1.0|No way I give these permissions to a game company. Absolutly no reason for it. Just amazing that Amazon lets these be a FAOTD. Obviously they don't care about privacy.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I believe that I have read all of John Grisham's books.... and, again, he has created a very entertaining and suspense filled book that keeps the reader guessing how it will end... until it does....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After the steamy Bared to you i was very curious as to how and if  the relationship between gideon and eva would develop. i discovered the series just before this one was release so fresh from having read the first one i bought this one. and never in my life have i been more frustrated with characters in a book. but in a good way. many many times i yelled 'that's not ok' or 'what are you doing' put my kindle down in frustration and walked away from the story only to return a fews minutes later to read a few more paragraphs and go 'oh, ok'.<br />where the first bookwas hot and heavy this one delved a little more into the characters and made them relatable where the first one hadn't. now i can't wait until number 3 comes out.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|It is perhaps one of he greatly anticipated super hits of all time.  Incredibly riviting.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 2 hours and them some.  Watch it!  You simply will not regret it.
B00846REIS|3.0|so i heard about this series in the press much like i'd discovered 50 shades. the similarities bothered me a lot: rich powerful guy, new girl at new job but the underlying story of abuse reeled me in. the book stopped to abruptly for me though and if the second book hadn't already been published i would not have continued with the series. there wasn't enough of a first book to make me want to wait for the second. but it is worth the read laying the ground work for the second book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it works well. I really like it, and is very helpful :)<br />try it you will like it too!!!!! :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was the best books I have listened to in a long time. I can't wait to buy her next one.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I think Dr. Alexander is trying to prove medically the existence of our Creator, but the book is dedicated to that proof with long, involved descriptions of the brain, his disease, and the medical community's response to his crisis.  Very little of the story records his memory of his time in Heaven.  I always knew I'd never make it as a medical student, but I still think I'll get to Heaven.  I'd like to have learned more about that and less about meningitis.  Still, if the book helps to overcome disbelief for some, then bless him for it.  I'll find out what I want to know eventually anyway.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I downloaded this app hoping that I could have a quick link to both current conditions and a forecast. It's a clock.
B00005N6KG|4.0|this In-The-Ear-Headphones, is a welcome change from the regular earphones that are always falling from my ears.they are clear and of course light-weight, and not cumbersome.no regrets in getting them.
B006RXQ0JO|1.0|This movie is so bad it doesn't deserve a review.  Its just a really dumb movie, and badly acted as well.  Save your money.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Fun game! lots of fun making your own carriers for the piggies. trying to get them to where they need to be and getting the highest score is work.Highly recommend it for free.
B0041KVW2K|2.0|Don't bother buying this. First of all, the end product is from a digital master. That clearly defeats the purpose of vinyl.<br /><br />Second, it sounds like a pile of mud. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on original pressings of the albums. I'm sorry, but that's the only way you're going to get to that great sound.<br /><br />I had really high hopes for this box set. I plunked down the money and bought it. The book that comes with it is beautiful, but that's secondary in my opinion. I wanted to hear some great vinyl. I was really disappointed. There is a chapter in the book describing how they mastered the vinyl. Listening to the vinyl, they should have just left that chapter out.<br /><br />Don't buy this. Seriously, just go and find some decent original pressings. You'll be a hell of a lot happier, trust me.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|One of the best comic book movies out there. Made even more amazing in 3D. Funny, gripping, and very entertaining. I highly recommend.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|To be so heavy and sound so beautifully melodic at the same time takes talent. No doubt about that. Glad to see this band continue to put out great music. I saw them live in the 90's and have to admit I like their last few albums even better than their earlier ones. \\"Swerve City\\", \\"Leathers\\" and \\"Tempest\\" are a few of my favorites on here, but it's worth getting the whole album.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I've seen almost all the bond movies, minus a few with Roger Moore and this is by far my favorite. Great action, cars, women, & storyline.
B008R5OJXE|5.0|\\"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\\" is, deservedly, one of Handel's most highly-regarded operas and one only needs to listen to this recording to understand why. Alan Curtis has brought together a superb cast which truly does this Baroque masterpiece justice.<br /><br />There is not a weak link in the cast. I am not always enamoured of Marie-Nicole Lemieux' voice (her vibrato can be a bit wayward at times), but her singing here is exemplary, strong and forthright with perfect control. Karina Gauvin is arguably the best soprano Cleopatra on disc! She has a truly beautiful voice and her singing is an absolute joy to listen to from beginning to end. This lady just seems to improve with each new recording she releases! Romina Basso, as Cornelia, sings in her usual lovely way, bringing out the pathos and intrinsically regal nature of Pompey's widow. I was already familiar with these three ladies (indeed, they were the main reasons I picked up this recording in the first place), but soprano Emoke Barath's was a name I did not know. What an incredible find she is! Her portayal of Sesto is simply wonderful, bringing across his yearning for heroic deeds and longing for vengeance with her sensitive singing. Her's is certainly a name to look out for in the future.<br /><br />All other cast members are well and truly the equals of those mentioned above. As always Il Complesso Barocco plays with intelligence and precision under their excellent conductor. To my way of thinking this is the \\"Giulio Cesare\\" I have been waiting for. As I stated in the title of this review, it is as near to perfect as a recording can be!<br /><br />I unreservedly recommend this recording to all lovers of Baroque opera!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|The Kindle fire becomes heavy after awhile of reading so being able to sit it down is a plus.  Appears to be durable.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Good if you're old and have a lot of time on your hands. Better than thinking about arthritis and all the other ailments that I have.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This is the worst movie ive ever seen! Completely cgi and unrealistic. Jumping from horse to horse...just a horrible movie!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fantastic Book.  And Book Three was equally good!Looking forward to reading more.  Thinking a movie version would be over the top!
B003Y3GTU0|5.0|Be warned, once you wear a pair of crocs you'll never want to wear another shoe!  I wear these Adrina sandals all the time.  I am short so flat shoes don't alway look good on me, but these do.  They are extremely comfortable and look really cute.  They run true to size and have a little arch support.  They hug your feet without rubbing anywhere.  I am considering buying a couple of different colors and add to my ever growing croc collection (I have 7 pairs!).  Recommended them to a couple of friends and they love them too.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|She has written many other books that really held your interest.  I had a hard time wanting to spend time absorbed in this book!
0307887448|5.0|What a great read!<br /><br />There were so many points in this book that were fun flashbacks for me.  \\"I remember that\\", \\"I loved that movie\\", \\"Great show\\", \\"forgot about that\\", etc...  And to top it all off it has a great plot line, and it's a page turner.<br /><br />This book will be great if you remember the 80's, but even if you don't you will still enjoy it.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|The thing I love most about this book is that is uses cliches. Yes. That's right. It uses them without becoming them. It's like it's self-aware. Not once did I think, \\"Wow. Just another book about high school.\\" It's so much more than that.<br />That's all to say: Please read this. It's well worth your time.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I've read most if not all the Jack Reacher books and this one is more of the same.  Easy to read and keeps you interested.  It's what you expect with these story lines.
B0075LTOR2|5.0|the volume on these discs is as low as the volume of a 1985 compact disc. but of course, everyone has a volume knob, so that shouldn't be a problem... right? i personally like to rip my CDs onto my mp3 player and shuffle my tracks so when \\"2 H.B.\\" off of Roxy Music's 1972 debut is over, and Crystal Castles' \\"Baptism\\" come on next, i nearly go deaf. almost all new albums/remasters today are released with this new \\"high volume standard\\" (example - The Beatles' '09 remasters rose the volume), however not all abide by it. this set is one of those rarities that fight for team quiet in the volume wars.<br /><br />otherwise, the remastering is exactly what all the other reviewers are claiming it to be... flawless! a magnificent improvement from the 1999 remasters! these sound cleaner. if you don't own the '99 remasters and are looking to fill in that gaping hole in your collection, look no further.<br /><br />the packaging is beautiful!<br /><br />this set is the holy grail for Roxy Music fans... everything is here. a Grade-A set!
B008458O3S|5.0|The graphics are simple but the game is very entertaining. I have played other games like this one and they may look prettier the challenge is just not there. You can get top score without using the least amount of track. It is still a dream for obsessive types. So much fun.
0865479410|5.0|Mr. Burkeman,  I heard you on NPR yesterday.  You have a fantastic voice, and I would really like to listen to you read your book while commuting.  Perfect topic for being stuck in traffic!  Please Record!!!
B009LL4LMM|5.0|jelly flop is a very solid &amp; fun physics-based game with good graphics. runs perfectly on my kindle fire. it is not really very different from angry birds, except it's better in that the entire area of play fits on the screen so you don't have to guess. your goal is to bounce &quot;jelly&quot; toward a feather which he wants so he can fly. to do this, you draw lines beside the various obstacles for him to bounce off of. then you press play &amp; watch him go. if you do it wrong you can keep re-trying till you get it right.<br /><br />this game makes you use your brain a bit, which can be good or bad depending on what you want. and if for some reason you want to post your scores on twitter or facebook you can do that, which is, i presume, the reason for all the permissions. permissions aside, jelly flop is a solid offering for a FAOTD.
B007THA4FI|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is the story of a town. Every family, every person has a history and a life that is affected by the others and by the death of one man. It is complex and fascinating to see their lives develop. It's particularly interesting to note all the logical misunderstandings and their consequences. I thought this was a wonderful comment on the human condition.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|In Standing Ovation, Susan Boyle gives us a sumptuously rich selection of soul-touching melodies, poignant lyrics and rich harmonies by some of the greats in musical theater--all sung in the rich, crystal-clear voice millions fell in love with just 3 short years ago. And she adds something rare in today's music: an understanding and ability to express the emotions that come with passionately held values.<br /><br />Miss Boyle fills every song in this 11-song cd with skilled combinations of nuance and power, giving voice to the depths and heights of emotions we all feel, but often find difficult to express. She starts with an interpretation of the iconic Somewhere Over the Rainbow that is filled with a longing I've never before heard in that song. Her interpretation of Bring Him Home flows smoothly between the voice of a mature woman standing up for her beloved boy, and the sweet voice of a young mother begging for her precious boy's life. Determination and triumph pour out of Susan's As Long as He Needs Me. In All I Ask of You, one of two duets with her life-time idol Donny Osmond, she gives us an oh-so-tender love song that is a warm melding of two voices made to sing together. And those are only 4 of the songs on this must-have cd!<br /><br />Warning: there is no background music in this album. Every song offers an irresistible invitation to enjoy your own passions for your own highest values.
B009FB3XTA|2.0|I own every single Twilight Soundtrack ... the songs on the CD's used to be anthems of me ... they'd get me excited about the movies, they'd fill my car up as I drove around, I loved them -- loved them so much, in fact, I'd buy the digital iTunes album for my computer and iPod as well.  I liked Twilight, loved New Moon, liked Eclipse ... then ... we got into the Breaking Dawn albums.<br /><br />If the ball of awesomesauce was dropped for Part 1 of Breaking Dawn ... the ball shattered on impact in Part 2.<br /><br />Gone are things I have loved about the soundtracks that came before -- the moody, almost haunting songs that guided us fans through the saga have replaced now by rock ballads and Greenday ... GREENDAY! There is nothing about the love of Bella and Edward that screams Greenday to me, sorry ya'll but it just doesn't. The redemption comes in maybe 3 songs in the entire album, but that's it and sadly, it's not enough.<br /><br />Finishing thoughts:  This was the END of a Saga that marked years for readers and fans ... and rather than going out with a bang, they busted and how incredibly disappointing is that?
1400032717|4.0|Anyone who is close to an autistic person must wonder about how he or she truly sees the world. We can never know, but this book offers some interesting insights into what it might be like. Every person with autism is different, but for me many of the characteristics of the main character rang true to the autistic person in my life--for instance, how he can understand complex math equations but not be able to read a novel. I don't know what Mark Haddon's background is, but I do think he did a great job of drawing what life might be like from inside one autistic person's mind. Because the main character's focus is on concrete sensations and objects, it actually helps create a stronger picture in your mind of what he is going through. Scenes such as how he experiences a busy train station or finding a series of letters really puts you in the character's situation.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|One of my favorite CD's.  Really good the music is beautiful and different. Not too fond of the last song on the CD, but this still deserves a 5 star rating.
B00846REIS|5.0|It is a great book, you really become captivated with the characters and drawn in their story.  I found myself struggling to put the book down because I wanted to see what was going to happen next in their relationship.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|in a way this movie is different then any other vampire movie. this movie has a great plot great action and great actors.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Forget the fighting and watch the relationships. Unbelievable anger and loneliness by one brother and the other brother, commitment to his wife and children! No pat answers at the end of this movie, you can finish and wonder if they ever came together. Best fight movie in a long time!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|this movie is amazing! i saw it in 3D the very first day it came out. this is a must own.
034580404X|3.0|I have to admit that I was shocked at the pornographic nature of these books.  They got such a great review and the wait list at the library was 23 people waiting.  I donate all my books to the library.  So they are on their way there.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great series.  Riordan does not disappoint with this continuation of the Percy Jackson universe.  The worst part about this book was realizing it was over and I'd have to wait a year for the next one to come out.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed it thoroughly...hard to put down. John Grissom pulled off another exciting thriller and this time the ending was totally unexpected.
0316228532|2.0|Dear Jo,<br />Well, you proved to everyone that you can write a book that is not about wizards. And there is certainly no solid argument for this one being geared to anyone but adult readers. You showed that you have skills with plot development and characterizations. But Jo, the world you have created in this book is ugly. The people are ugly. If you intended to represent modern English society as prejudiced and hypocritical you have done a good job. The towns you created are inhabited by child abusers, drug addicts and thieves. The picture you have painted is hopeless and sad. Why would anyone want to read about that? We are not entertained by the unbearable pain of other people, and not amused to think that the world is exclusively populated by vicious and hopeless people.<br /><br />I hope you are doing well, and have been associating with people who are successful or at least happy with their lives. I hope to hear about them soon.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Booker2

B009AZZEU2|5.0|King Animal is a fantastic addition to Soundgarden's list of studio albums.  Anytime a popular band reunites and puts out an album after 16 years, there'll be criticism aplenty (no matter what they do) and certainly a ton of hype to live up to.  In today's age, living up to that hype is nearly impossible.  But frankly, I think Soundgarden for the most part does that with King Animal.  The first 6 songs are sensational - with \\"A Thousand Days Before\\" my early favorite on the album.  After that, King Animal mellows out a bit - not as drudgy and dark as something like \\"Let Me Drown\\" or \\"Overfloater\\" but not as rocking as say the first four songs on this album.  \\"Halfway There\\" and to some extent \\"Black Saturday\\" seem out of place - very good songs but I can't help feeling they came from a source outside of or previous to SoundGarden's reuniting and thus not a perfect fit on King Animal.  But the album ends strong with \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\" and \\"Rowing\\".  Overall, it's just a great great album - and I can't stop listening to it!  I gave King Animal 5 stars - really it's about 4 and 3/4 in my book but that's close enough to 5 - so there ya go.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|For the price....this knife cannot be beat! Overall, it's a beast, will last a lifetime, is delivered very sharp, made from 1095 HC steel, comes with a \\"basically\\" good sheath, and feels good in the hand. I don't believe you can find a better heavy duty survival knife for the money.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|Classic American Pie humor. Jim is a clown, & Stifler is a butthead as usual.  Had me on the floor several times during the movie.
0312641893|5.0|This book was kind of weird...but I COULD NOT STOP READING!! It completely captivated me. I was so curious about how things would end up throughout the whole book. There are so many different pieces of the story occurring at the same time that it really keeps you on your toes. I love Cinderella, so I loved the fairy tale part of the story. The futuristic technology part was confusing at times, but overall it was cool to see. I think it was a really creative idea. I loved Cinder. She was so strong and had such courage. I was definitely rooting for her throughout the whole book. Kai was a sweetheart and I was very intrigued by the romance part of the book. I think this book was so well written! The only thing I did not like was not knowing the rest of the story and having to wait for the next book!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Last season blew my mind but this one just keeps one upping it!!!! It's amazing!!!! I normally don't like anything zombie but this is just what I like!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My subconscious is appalled that I finished this book.  It was so bad! The story is weak.  In the last 5 minutes I've come up with a better story in my head.<br /><br />The main character is so annoying. Laughable , no really, I'm laughing, that she is a literary student.  If she clambers into a bed or a car one more time......ugh! Overused words - clamber , reverie , sardonically, inner goddess, jeez, holy crap, holy S, subconscious - just to name a few.<br /><br />The sex scenes are boring.  It takes a little longer to climax than that ... let's be real.  Also 4 times in one night on a repeated basis? Sure.  I love fantasy ,but this is too far off.<br /><br />They're both too young for this story to be good.  He's 26 and she's 21.<br /><br />Don't buy this!!!!! It's offensive that it's on the NYT bestseller list !!!!!!!<br /><br />BTW I've read Twilight.  twilight is a literary piece of genius in comparison.  Genius!

B0086213XW|1.0|This movie caused me to log into my facebook account and tell everyone the movie isn't worth watching, let alone renting.  Terrible.  I think it's just the story because, in general, I like the actors, though I would question if they actually read the script.
B008ENA74E|3.0|Author tells a bit about the malfesience at GS but mainly talks about his own great performance and high standards of ethical behavior.  If you want to read about a GS derivitave trader glorifying himself, this is the book!  He doesn't scratch the surface of what really goes on at GS!
0486275590|5.0|Pirates are the endurable symbol of man's desire for freedom from restriction and the cost of such freedom. They are one of the few mythic archetypes in literature that can be both the villain of the story as well as the protagonist thanks in large part to Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. Few adventure stories have had such a wide-ranging impact on storytelling and popular culture. While Stevenson did not invent the swashbuckling genre, the argument can be made that he made a swashbuckling story that is close to perfect.<br /><br />To read the rest of the review, please visit the King's Crier: Book Reviews blog.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|My 5 stars are provisional because I am torn between being awed by Cloud Atlas, and being suspicious that it's really just an artful contrivance.  Either way, it's a great read.
B004P7CMDM|5.0|2 of the best of the crow moviess.. in this package you get 2 movies for the price of 1.. the price was so good, I bought a set for myself and a friend.
B009SCRERI|5.0|I purchased Secret of the Wings because my granddaughter loves Tinkerbell--we play with Tink and her friends often.  When I previewed the film, I was especially pleased that Disney excluded any scary villains that could give a young child nightmares.  When Bonnilee came to visit, she watched Secret of the Wings three times.  This three year old was captivated by the story of the two sisters \\"risking their wings\\" to see and experience each other's world.  I appreciate the lessons of loyalty, support, and enduring love that the film offers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play this when im winding down at the end of the day and when there is nothing good on tv!
B004WR125O|5.0|Works perfectly.  Receives strong signal from Apple Airport which is in a different room in the house.  A few reviewers seem to have had problems with signal strength but I have not experienced any problems.  I feel this adapter is well worth the price.  Set up was quick and easy and the unit has functioned reliably.
0307887448|1.0|Not sure how much longer I can continue plodding through this thing. I'm at Chapter 7 already and I kind of feel that at this point, I should be liking the protagonist enough to be rooting for him. Instead he still comes off as this geekier-than-thou, know-it-all douchebag and I don't really want anything good to happen to him. The narration is incredibly dull.  (First I did this.  Then I did that.  Then that happened and it triggered an idea because I'm such an 80's pop-culture genius [repeat pattern over and over]) I do realize it's the author's first novel. The problem is it was being touted as first-rate when it reads more like first-attempt. Yeah, I might just have to put this book down.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|Sure, maybe it's not the most original premise, but what it may lack in originality it make up with beautiful graphics. I wanted to leave a review while it was still the FAOTD, so I don't yet know whether the later levels might be too easy or difficult. But it's so cute that it makes me happy to look at it, and I have high hopes for it. For the reviewer that asked, this version is ad-free, unlike the free google version. I agree that there aren't any permissions that concern me. I have an app that alerts me to invasive permissions and it didn't have anything to say about this. You can read the reasons behind the permissions in the google play store.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I highly recommend this series.  It is full of richly detailed characters as well as great sets and special effects.  Something happens every episode to advance the storyline too -not like Falling Skies or Revolution where the story goes in circles and never advances.
159102594X|5.0|If you're looking for fantasy books to read this series is just tremendous.  The characters are well fleshed out and interesting. Great world building.  The writing is fantastic.  Looking forward to reading this author's other books!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I've been playing this game for a quite a while (I'm at level 101) and love it other than trying to get you to pay real cash for upgrades. My kids play it on their kindles also and is a great learning game. BUT... now it won't open on any of our kindles! HELP!!!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Crossed is a fantastic sequel to Matched! This book had me sucked in from Chp. 1. I had a really difficult time setting it down, and I'm dying to get my hands on the third book. I would recommend this series to  everyone!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is a great read. A can't put it down page turner. Like his earlier stuff. Reminiscent of The Firm. Can't wait to see the movie!
B007V65R54|4.0|This book contains statistical information in a manner intelligible to many lay people, but still demands thoughtful attention and occasional rereading of portions. Not a casual read, but filled with important every day information. It illustrates the foibles of predicting the future of a wide variety of things such as the stock market and climate change. Very thought provoking.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a great Grisham read. I was a little bit disappointed with the prior book and approached this one with doubt, but it definitely did not disappoint. It has all of the wonderful aspects that most of his stories have. It keeps you in suspicion because you continuously feel that there must be more to the story than just the facts you get in the first few chapters. I, too, work in the legal field, but I work in the north, not in the south. Seems to me that some of Mr. Grisham's stories might have a bit of truth woven into the fiction. Interesting!
1401322786|4.0|Time. We all use and abuse it, and it is the topic of conversation everywhere. In his new book, Mitch Albom follows three distinct people in their search for more time.<br /><br />Dor is a man with principles. When he refuses to work on the tower to the heavens, he and his wife leave their family to keep them safe. But as his wife lays dying, Dor runs for the tower. What happens next determines the  beginnings of \\"Father Time.\\" Victor Delamonte has vast wealth, but finds it can neither buy happiness or health. He makes some choices about his remaining time without telling his wife. He wants more time. Sarah Lemon is a teenager who doesn't fit in. She wants time to speed up, but her choices lead her to greater difficulties. What would happen if these three met? Mitch Albom explores that question and what the results would be, encouraging the reader to be careful what they wish for.<br /><br />This is a powerful book about time and how we use it. I enjoyed the characters, and while I didn't like the stories being interrupted by each other, it all made sense in the end. Time - we need to spend more of it loving others and enjoying what God has given us.
B009329Y30|5.0|The movie was great!!! I would recommend this movie for you all to watch!!! It is great, you will enjoy it!!!
B007REV4T8|3.0|Daniel Craig's haggard, wrinkled, dropping face says much about \\"Skyfall\\" and the James Bond persona.  After fifty years, James Bond has become a very old and tired cliche, a character borne of the racist British imperial patriarchy that still lives and breathes well in Mayfair, London and Victoria Peak, Hong Kong, but has thankfully passed away in the rest of the modern world.  In today's world, it's hard to justify why James Bond fights, and nearly impossible to create a compelling conflict that captures our imagination.  If John Le Carre couldn't find a cause worth fighting for after the Cold War, then neither could James Bond.<br /><br />But, alas, the show must continue.  In today's spy movies, thanks to the Bourne movies, exotic locales, parkour, motorcycle chases on rooftops, train collisions are de rigueur, and we get all that in the first ten minutes.  So for the next unbearably long two hours we'll left to deal with the existentialist angst of James Bond and M16, as they force to justify and explain their existence in an increasingly skeptical world.  Needless to say, James Bond does not and cannot do so, and so instead just goes drinking, gambling, whoring, and killing -- and when all the gratuitous violence is all done he and M16 are newly resurrected, and all the inquiry and skepticism have all gone away.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" is an incredibly stupid movie, but somehow in its ponderousness and pretentiousness it seems to have hit its mark.
B004LX0D36|4.0|had not read this book since school days , its a joy to read , and one gets a real feel for the times when women were dependent on their men folk , not allowed to own property in their own right , and a good marriage was the aim

B0041KVW2K|4.0|If your buying to listen to and enjoy, fine.  Book is fantastic, just awesome.  If you are buying as a collector to keep in a corner and sell one day, forget it.  Many quality problems on manufacturing process on individual albums.  Off center spins, strings of pearls and inconsistent surface noise to name just a few imperfections.  Rarely find an MFSL with a problem ever.  As a collector I would not purchase a sealed set of this boxset in the future from someone, say on ebay.  Unlike MFSL boxsets of past and orig pressings etc., the chances of problems with the new pressing seems rather high.  Many are being returned and replacements are being sent which also have problems.  The US pressing plant was terrible and no need to mention their name here.  This is a perfect example of going with the lowest bidder and getting sub par product.  Shame all this work was done at abbey road etc and the final step, the pressing, was flawed.  If you buy the box set don't tuck it away as a collectable unopened with plans to sell.  Long term this will surely become known to audiophiles as the boxset with problems and sealed resales will not be desired.  Open every one and check them and you must listen to them.  3 albums in mine have to be replaced do to ubearable surface noise and pearls in the vinyl.  CAUSE of this is simple.  Poor quality control.  That being said, music is great of course and those without flaws sound pretty good.  Likely would sound even better with a higher quality pressing...

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have been a huge fan of Nelson DeMille for several years, and I have read every one of his books. I think The Gold Coast is an outstanding novel, and The General's Daughter, Up Country and Word of Honor are all classics, in my opinion. That is not the case with his latest offering, The Panther. In my opinion, the story line is very weak, the Panther is neither threatening nor realistic sounding and the entire premise comes across as ridiculous. While members of the ATTF might be sent to Yemen to investigate the Cole bombing, etc., their role in this story is really stretching it. Mr. DeMille often comments in his Foreword or Acknowledgements that he sometimes takes literary license, but this is over the top. The most maddening problem with this book is the constant wiseass remarks by John Corey; some outloud and some just crossing his mind. Virtually every paragraph contains the wisecracks, most of which aren't very funny. In fact, he seems to strain to come up with something cute to say. It was extremely distracting to the story, and two friends of mine who were reading their copies at the same time complained about this, as well. I look forward to the next DeMille work, but if it is a John Corey novel, I'll pass on it. Love to see more Paul Brenner, but we'll see. I really don't recommend this particular novel.
B00005JKG5|5.0|got this for a good price..love watching this movie time and time again. Dancers  can make it with their own style.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Fantastic. There's no other way to describe this box set. If you're a huge fan of the matrix, this is your fix; your very own Jesus Christ. I bought this when the first disk from my 10 disk DVD set stopped working and it was worth the money. I ended up watching everything all over again in BluRay. Great stuff. :D

B0090X4GLW|4.0|I went into the cinema expecting to hate this film and came out very surprised, which doesn't happen often and logically shouldn't have happened then.  A mashup of Glee and Major League, liberally season with pop music that I despise on a nearly philosophical level, should not have been my second favorite movie of the year, yet it was, and the music had a lot to do with it.  On the whole, I was impressed with the performances, though I have difficulty believing that some, like those of Rebel Wilson, aren't walking with the aid of digital crutches.<br /><br />I have only two complaints.  First, the sanitized a cappella arrangements are entirely too sterile, lacking the verve of their film counterparts.  This is a sad but unsurprising trend among the soundtracks of modern film musicals.  La Vie Bohème from the Rent soundtrack, for example, was a bit of a snooze divorced from the youth defiance of the action.  Second, the performance of Michael Jackson's Blame In On The Boogie by the Footnotes, arguably the best a cappella piece in the film, is conspicuously absent.  I sincerely hope this oversight stems a legal issue and not from any perceived lack of marketability because none of the leads are in it.<br /><br />In all consideration, it's a decent soundtrack from a solidly enjoyable film.
B00722Y1EK|5.0|- very customizable<br />- the overlay display for all kinds of system information is great (my lives in the statusbar)<br />- currently 'hide in fullscreen' is not working on JB, but thats not a real problem<br />- only downside is, that this PRO version is not available through Play Store
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is the perfect ending to the series. I loved the rest of the series and I love his new series heroes of Olympus.
1423140605|3.0|Just an issue with the publishing of the book.  I had purchased it for my granddaughter and she informed me that it was missing 30 pages, then had some pages repeated later on.  I called Amazon and the gentleman sent me a return slip and shipped out a new one that was put together properly immediately.  I returned the defective one and my granddaughter is now enjoying the book.  Thank you Amazon for standing behind your products.
B008G59IKO|5.0|So let me say this right away, if you're close minded or just like the old school Green Day, you will most likely be disappointed. And I'm also not a huge fan of the 60's style or garage rock, but after a couple listens to this album, it really grew on me and I can listen to the whole album front to back. I don't even want to compare it to Uno! just because it's so different. But this album is so well written, the lyrics can be pretty basic at times but it doesn't cripple the album at all. This is just a really fun album that takes a couple listens to 'get' it. Lazy Bones may be their standout track, it's just pure genius.<br /><br />I think the reason I love this album so much is because this is the one album in the trilogy I had my doubts about because I knew it was a 60's style record. But it was a huge surprise, I think it's better than Uno! in terms of energy and 'fun.'

B0085Z8F4A|3.0|Well, this movie looks good from a graphic standpoint, but the story line and plot are so full of holes that it still irritates me weeks after seeing it.  I headed online to figure out what was going on and how all this was supposed to piece together.  If this was intended to be a multi-movie release then I can understand it being left so wide open.  If not and this was meant to be a stand-alone movie, I would have rated it a 2 star.<br /><br />Again, you are left in the end asking, \\"Why, why this, why that, how come, what happens,...?\\" etc. etc.  This is one of those movies I wish I had either not watched or waited until the whole box set comes out.  After the online research, I found that no one really knows what the director meant to convey and it is all just conjecture at this point until a follow-up movie is released.  Even then, the movie had so many questions that it may end up like \\"Star Wars\\" in that movie I and II are just filler leading up to III.<br /><br />Not a waste of time as I am a science fiction fan, but if you like movies that have a tidy, wrap-up kind of ending, you may finish this movie feeling kind of hollow as I did.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved all the unexpected turns.<br />When it ended I wanted more.  Partially because the ending was a little more abrupt than I expected or maybe wanted.  Overall, a very good read that I would recommend to all my friends.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham seldom disappoints.  Some books are better than the others. One starts to get used to his format and remembers that in the end, all eventually meet even though some of them are a bit far fetched.  Even with that, his books are enjoyable.  I enjoy the tongue in cheek endings very much and so will you the reader.
0316187216|4.0|I'm a huge Abercrombie fan, but I have to say Red Country is not his best work. Unlike in his previous novels, a lot of the characterization felt a little bit rushed. Characters didn't seem as developed, and their motivations were a little bit less interesting. At times it seemed like we were introduced to a character only to never hear from them in a meaningful way again.<br /><br />That being said, this book is still absolutely incredible. Abercrombie's writing style really sucks you in. You can read this without having read any of his past works and enjoy it, but readers who have gone through his previous books will get a kick out of seeing a ton of old characters.
B00005QK3W|5.0|OK - I'm one of those old farts who watched the Beatles LIVE on Ed Sullivan almost 50 years ago so I'm a certified Beatles addict. And for further full disclosure - I'm a McCartney fan. I didn't listen to this album when it first came out. I bought it in 2008 based on a review here at Amazon. This album is McCartney inspired... he was just starting out with Heather (OK-OK... we all know now about her) and he was on a mission to express his \\"love\\" for her. SO many great songs on this album. Not ONE that I hate. If you're a certified Beatles addict (and a McCartney fan), buy it. Trust me. And listen to it several times. It'll grow on you really fast.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I'm so glad that I didn't pay for this piece of mystery meat.  I was able to complete one room, then exited the game before it sent me to the Kitchen.<br /><br />Now, whenever I start the game, the mansion map appears, but the game freezes right up - can't do a thing.  Tried to restart it a number of times and got the same result.  I'm guessing that the designers did not do a thorough validation/beta test on this game, or they would have caught this problem.<br /><br />Note: this problem may occur whenever you leave one room, and before you enter another, when you decide to exit.

0545265355|5.0|I hardly ever read books. I've never liked reading. But I couldn't put these books down. Although, I'm sure the 3rd book will make a good movie, it was my lease favorite book. I can't stand reading a book that doesn't have a lot of conversation and the 3rd book was action packed but not much conversation. Still a great book, just my personal opinion.
B004UID2LC|4.0|This ebook is part of the series of alternate history of Germany covering the Grantville replacement into Europe and how they are changing the world of that time.  It is a very interesting series and keeps a person wanting to see how the world keeps changing in the 1630's.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|Nylunds' prequel to Halo:CE is a gripping account of some fairly loose, shallow military sci-fi. Not the most ground-breaking stuff, but definitely fun to read.

0316044695|4.0|Overall, this book was a very good read. I felt like I was with Marcus throughout each of the experiences he discusses. Some people were critical of the time he took to describe the training and his bias towards the \\"liberal media\\" and other \\"liberals.\\" While I may not necessarily agree with him, I cannot image what it was like to write this book and think back about the decisions they made that impacted their mission. The emotions that came through while he was writing this book were evident throughout and I feel that I can not, in any honest way, criticize him for what he feels after the entire ordeal he went through. The only thing that kept me from rating it five stars was the way it was written. At times it was very choppy and I had to reread a sentence or two to keep up. Just like this review. Enjoy!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Gave it four stars for keeping me engaged. I enjoyed the story. Looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This book was surprisingly dull and one of the worst Patricia Corwells I have read!  It barely kept my attention and I had to skip portions of the book so I was not bored to death!  The plot was dull and the end fairly anticlimatic.  The forensices did not add any interest either.  I thought there would be more drama surrounding the dinosaur dig, but it was hardly mentioned.  So...the book was really the empty bed and I don't recommend wasting your money on it.  Obviously Patricia must of had a car payment to make!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I Loved It. Still one of the greatest movies ever made! It's in the same level of Terminator and Predator!
B007U4DDXK|5.0|Since my husband and I are great fans of the Beverly Hills Chihuahua's movies,  of course we loved the third one.<br />And just maybe how some human father's feel about letting their little girls go.
0345803485|1.0|Mills & Boon with 75% explicit sex. Reminds me of women who remain in abusive relationships because of their emotions.
B005HSL626|4.0|I agree with the other person.the game is awesome and get over you're selves people if you don't want the ads then buy the other simple as that.dur! so stop your whining
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have tried various versions of solitaire and this is a good one.  I can play it on my Fire or my Galaxy S3.  Even on the smaller screen it's easy to play. You can tap on a card and it will automatically play it, although it's not always to the best place. Once you reach a finish point it will auto-complete, just like my old version on Windows. The only thing it won't do that I miss is give you the option of a 3 card deal like I learned growing up.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I loved Sigh no More and Babel does not disappoint, either.  Though the pace, at times, is somewhat slower, the overall mood is more open and positive.  Though more positive is not always a plus for an album, it holds true for M&S.  The songs speak deeply and the music builds on itself in each song.  Lyrically, probably my favorite album of the year.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is excellent.  A very quick read that will leave you longing for more.  I bought this book and when I finished reading it had to immediately go and buy the second and third book in the series.  Only took me a week to read all three because they are that good.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett is continuing to tell the fascinating story of the twentieth century through the lives of his original characters, and now the story includes their children.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it is a nice little clock. I like it for when I have to get up early for school. I love it
B0085RQLXK|1.0|This is a big disappointment and I do believe Ive bought my last Aerosmith album. Joe Perry said a cross between Rocks and Toys? What is he smoking? Maybe these guys should go back and dig through old tapes like Van Halen did and make a real Aerosmith record. Sorry but I just dont get this and Im only half way through the thing. UPDATED: Just got to the Carrie Underwood track. WTF? The further I get into this thing the worse it gets. Lots of sappy ballads and not enought rockers. Sorry die hard fans from the early years this has nothing to offer us. Now if you like all the sappy stuff that put them on the map you will love it but then you are not a real Aerosmith fan just a fan of the commercial rock that was shoved down your throat.
B003WKOU0G|3.0|There are some adorable babies in this film.  The different lifestyles is amazing. But in spite of that<br />  babies make the world a much better place. I enjoyed this short film.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|Pretty In Pink is a timeless classic.  Ducky will always be Ducky and the record store scene with Annie Potts will always ring true.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Of course the show is out standing and I'm so hooked on it I have now seen all the seasons and episodes that are available.<br />The story is great, the acting is the best I'v seen since the Sopranos.<br />I recommend this highly
0446547646|5.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks, I haven't read the book yet, but I'm sure I will enjoy it. The price and shipping time were above my expectations.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|This Album is just too good to put into words. I have listened to the Deftones since their inception with Adrenaline. I came to love them with Around the Fur. White Pony has consumed such a chunk of my life that it is unreal. I thought they were on the downside with their self titled album, which I enjoyed it but I just didn't feel it like I had with the others. Could be that I was hung over from White Pony , but it just didn't seem on par . Saturday Night wrist had it's moments and was enjoyable but is probably my least favorite album of theirs. I was not disappointed because their music catalog was by the time very impressive already and I had thought maybe they had just started to run their course with getting older and maybe even tired of the grind. Then Diamond Eyes came out which I feel was closest to Around The Fur. It was a great album but it also had it's high and low points. I felt myself liking certain songs a great deal more than other songs on the album. Enter Koi No Yokan, I really had a feeling that this album might be a let down being released soo close to Diamond Eyes, was I ever wrong. The attention to detail and the composition of this entire album is masterful to say the least. It is one of those albums that each time I listen to it I am picking up something I didn't catch before. I have no favorite or least favorite song, start to finish this is their masterpiece. It takes alot for me to say that I feel this is their best work yet. It may not be everyone's favorite Deftones CD , but I think it is safe to say everyone will like it if you like the deftones.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|I think \\"Rodrick Rules\\" is a better book than the first all over. It was funnier and more creative. A score for Kinney\\"!
0316228532|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  Felt it was weird and that I should have waited to read from a library.  I would very much have preferred not to have spent money on it....especially when my space is limited and there are FAR better novels to make part of my permanent collection.<br /><br />Harry Potter I will read over and over again.  This book, one and done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Since all the changes were made it works great!!!! I use it at least a few times a week. No complaints.
B000AMJC2K|3.0|This arm is well built and does a fine job of supporting my 22\\" Samsung.  The three star rating is because the arm does not move vertically.  The height is fixed.  I read the reviews and the description but it never jumped out.  Overall, I would rather have paid extra and gone with another product.  Why didn't I return it?  This thing is heavy and shipping would have been another $20+.
0984183523|5.0|This book is great. If you are interested in work in consulting this is simply must have. In the book Victor explains why do consulting firms ask certain questions, helps you to understand interviewers mindset and understand what(and why) he is looking for during the interview. He also introduces basic frameworks for solving case interviews and adds his tips for how to impress interviewers. If you liked this book I would also recommend you to purchase LOMS program from Victor, It is also great stuff and definitely worth the money.
1419705849|5.0|I loved did, and so my 11 year old daughter.  You will read about the early years of Greg, his uncle Gary, Rowley's unexplainable success with girls, pantsers, chickenpox, and other goings on of the middle school.  Illustrations are as fresh and funny as always, Greg is as obnoxious as expected, another good book in the series.
B005RKBZEI|3.0|I was not always a huge Darren Hayes fan... I was not caught up in the \\"chicka cherry cola\\" fanaticism, Savage Garden was fun but not exactly something I'd go out of my way for. And then Darren Hayes went rogue. Rogue in that creative indie can't-we-make-pop-music-reputable kind of rogue that made me a convert. Spin really was Savage Garden volume 3, but \\"The Tension & The Spark\\" kind of shed that and started down a much darker path... a place I was all too willing to follow. \\"I Like The Way\\" and \\"Dublin Sky\\" are probably the best duo from that album... sheer pop brilliance all driven by a pulsating dance beat and a stripped-back emotional wrencher. You could totally tell that there was something deeper afoot there. And then came the full bloom of \\"This Delicate Thing We've Made.\\" Sprawling, unfocused, uneven & demanding - there are all sorts of explanations for why many people don't find \\"This Delicate Thing We've Made\\" to be great, but Darren Hayes was clearly making the music he wanted to make and doing it well. My hat is off to him for the daring alone, but I will always love \\"Casey\\" and \\"Who Would Have Thought?\\" and as much as I want to dismiss \\"I Just Want You To Love Me\\" as cheesy, it strikes a little too close to home and \\"Conversations With God\\" actually helped me articulate the position a friend of mine was in that I hadn't previously understood. That's the kind of thing for me that changes music into a touchstone, the difference between disposable \\"pop\\" and why popular music can wield a disturbing amount of power. That kind of trajectory is probably not sustainable, but I was following the making of Secret Codes & Battleships all through the following years and chomping at the bit for the year it took the album to actually come out.<br /><br />So I was met with Secret Codes & Battleships, having been warned that it was a step back towards mainstream pop music. Fine, I was ready for more \\"On The Verge Of Something Wonderful\\" and less \\"100 Challenging Things A Boy Can Do.\\" I've been listening to these codes for months now, and I'm just...not... into it. Don't get me wrong, this is a reasonably good album but I can't agree with the reviewers who unabashedly praise it. \\"Taken By The Sea\\" while the lyrics are more traditional (as in made up of images and themes we've all heard before), it's a solid opener. \\"Black Out The Sun\\" is the stunner, well written and swollen with pain. \\"Stupid Mistake\\" is the fun single, fun to sing and easy to digest. \\"God Walking Into The Room\\" is one of my favorites & while I like \\"God Is In The Room\\" (which for whatever reason seems to be unavailable) this is an improvement. But then, I'm left ambivalent towards the \\"big\\" single... \\"Talk Talk Talk\\"??? Really? Next. \\"Don't Give Up\\" and \\"Nearly Love\\" are both perky enough to be serviceable, but they're not compelling. \\"Roses\\" is downright trite. I spend most of this album bouncing back and forth between songs I really like and wanting to like it more. I'm not sure why \\"Explode\\" or \\"Perfect\\" were deemed \\"bonus tracks\\" but \\"Cruel Cruel World\\" and \\"Roses\\" made the album proper.<br /><br />I have a problem with artists I fall in love with & end up having really high expectations of. Often, they'll come out with something I wasn't expecting and it will take a bit for me to be able to hear what they recorded as opposed to what I was hoping for. I was waiting to see if this would be one of those, but I don't think at this point that I'll be turning this particular corner. I think this is a case where Darren went back to making more \\"pop\\" and less powerful. I don't begrudge him & I hope that he sells enough copies to record whatever he wants next, because that's what I really want to hear. I can't say that there's really anyone else making the kind of music Darren Hayes does, but if you are looking for something in the ballpark, I'd recommend Emeli Sande's \\"Our Version Of Events\\" because she can really sing and takes the time to put together lyrics that are easily as powerful as anything here. I'd love to hear them duet, but that's probably just a fantasy. Snow Patrol's \\"Eyes Open\\" also goes well, though I haven't heard anything else by them that's as good as that one album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recommend this book for ages 11+. Anything one under that age could get scared or have horrible night mirrors. Also soon seems just aren't appropriate.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|It is rare that I find an artist who captivates me out of the gate, impressing me with both their voice and ability to write lyrics. Interestingly enough, I first heard of Emeli in an interview with one of the kids from Glee who said she had an amazing voice & no one in the States had heard of her yet. I was intrigued enough to look her up & I haven't looked back. When I first looked, there was only a scattering of acoustic videos available on YouTube since this album hadn't been released yet. Interestingly, this led me through a realization about production values. When you listen to the acoustic version of \\"Heaven,\\" the subtext of the lyrics are much more apparent and I was originally frustrated by how overpowering the dance beat of the official version was. Over time, I've come to really enjoy them both, though I wonder if I would have ever gotten hooked if I'd only had the dance mix as reference first. That being said, I love the mix of \\"Next To Me\\" on the album because the driving drum beats they added amplify what was a good song into a great song.<br /><br />Emeli is a great writer and at her best with lyrics that can be interpreted depending on your experiences... \\"Daddy\\" especially strikes me as an ill-advised love story or story of chemical addiction, making it's point all the better because I'm not sure those are entirely different things. \\"River\\" is a great reflection on life and what it takes to evolve. For standout favorites, though, I have to go with \\"Read All About It\\" and, if you're evaluating different versions of this album go with the one that has \\"Easier In Bed\\" (haunting how close to the bone she can get, this is NOT sugar-coated pop). At the same time, depending on my mood, \\"My Kind Of Love\\" is the kind of assertive message I like to belt out in my car that can be my favorite on the album, or maybe the tender, deep-in-denial \\"Suitcase.\\" I am shamed to admit that it took me a dozen listens before I realized that her reference to \\"Martin\\" was about Martin Luther King, but when it finally hit me, the whole of \\"Hope\\" took on a whole other level of meaning. It's this kind of prize that makes me love and respect and artist and album, a sentiment that strikes me all too rarely, but all the more welcome for it.
B004SN8YXK|3.0|I'll cut to the chase. These are very narrow for minimalist footwear. I have average feet and they are way to constrictive to really be good minimalist shoes. Minimalist shoes should allow your toes to splay easily and move around. If you have really narrow feet these may work well then. Also they are very HOT. Unlike the Trail Gloves which these are a variant of, they have a thick material in the upper that is almost like waterproof. And no venting at all. These may be great for a dedicated pair of winter trail shoes if you have narrow feet, but thats about all. They do look great though, and dont stand out as minimalist like VFF's and others do.<br /><br />Merrell makes some other of their shoes in wide widths, like the very similar Trail Glove, these would be much better with a wide width option.
1936608618|5.0|Brian MacKenzie has been a foundational resource for a number of years. Only when the launch of crossfitendurance.com occurred was his particular brand of training available to the masses. With the publication of Speed Power and Endurance a text is now available. I evaluated this text as a teacher (I am a University Professor of Kinesiology) and as an athlete (I have been a CrossFiter for over 4-years).<br /><br />From the perspective of teaching - the information provided in the text is exceptional and well organized. Brian and Glen have done a very good job of presenting a large amount of detailed information in a manner that is not confusing, well articulated and visual. All of these qualities are paramount to the success of instruction. The information is logical and sound.<br /><br />From the perspective of learning - The method in which the science behind the model is presented is appreciated and I think under represented in other texts. I found the book easy to navigate and structured in a fashion that afforded the ability to refer to various sections without feeling lost. The information is presented logically and to a level of depth that I appreciated. I am experienced with the CFE model and like very much that I now have a reference/guidance tool within my arms reach.<br /><br />I believe Speed Power Endurance is an excellent guide to training and highly recommend it without reservation.
1604590483|5.0|I learned quite a few things from this publication.  Few are aware of what the human mind is capable of.  This book offers some valuable insight.  Worth the read.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I installed it in Kindle Fire as soon as I bought it almost a year ago and it's very useful. I like it.
B00005JKJA|3.0|This was an OK movie....rather difficult to get through at times, losing my attention.  I liked it, but am glad that I did not pay to see it in a theater
B0049U4NQO|5.0|I don't know why they \\"obviously can't date\\" I actually know of a step brother and sister who married. If they aren't blood relations, i don't know why this is seen as wrong.<br /><br />That said, i think this book was quite daring but realistic. To truly end it, Alex needs to get out of England. Even with Blunt gone, so many know about him that i don't think he and Jack will be left alone. And being adopted by Sabina's parents makes sense to me. Having Jack just leave would be kind of anti-climatic (although if she went back to America, she could still have a lot of interaction with Alex. Actually, strike that-Alex and the Pleasures are in California, and she hales from the capitol. Kind of easy to forget how big the USA is!)<br /><br />Besides that, i think that the Pleasures (and especially Sabina) are the only ones that can realistically help Alex to heal (emotionally i mean) At the end of an earlier book (or two maybe?), it was Sabina that drew Alex out of his funk.<br /><br />At least Alex lived at the end. Agatha Christie killed off her characters!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book. Good concept and imagination. Wish there was more to the story but otherwise kept me hooked. Waiting for more like this one!
0345803493|4.0|Once you get over the \\"SEX' aspect of this series you do find a redeeming story. Being a flawed although sucessful guy, Christian Grey finds acceptance in a young girl who has enough maturity to accept him without being a crazy overly emotional 20-something that most of us propably were. It was a good story and fun to read.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|one of my favorites. got it as a free app of the day, not sure i would pay $5 for it though.
0345803507|5.0|Although I found the premise of these books a little far fetched,, I did enjoy the story.<br />The news labeled them as \\"mommy porn\\" which I have to tell you, that there are more sexually explicit books out there.<br />E.L James found the redeeming value in our main character that shows that we all can over come the crap that life sometimes throws at us given a chance. Christian Grey was damaged and used sex to cope. Luckily he found a very emotionally introspective virginal young women who acted and responded more maturely than most women her age, which at 21-22yrs old is the part I had a hard time with. Never the less it was a cute story and I did enjoy reading it.
B004N8CP8K|5.0|I have to use a RDP app to connect to my school's electronic patient record for dental school. This app is effective and easy to use. It is easy to add connections, and I have never had a problem with it crashing or anything else. I highly recommend this for anyone that needs a RDP app, especially since it is free.
B003L77GRY|5.0|If you're a fan you gotta see it. Classic Dexter. All you expect from the series & so much more.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is by far my favorite angry birds. There are so many levels and they tie in the actual characters from the star wars movies.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you need to buy a copy. Sad things were like this back then, but glad they changed. This movie really illustrates the struggles and the victories of these men. Would like to say more... but you need to see it for yourself.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|definetly fun with lots to do been playing for two days and still am no where near done but its fun and realistic
B00417HV14|5.0|I will never regret purchasing this dvd. If it can be worn out I'm sure I'll be the first to do it. definitly a must have for any blues lover.
B001I13PM0|3.0|Anyone else wonder why there are only 65 minutes of video on a dvd that is capable of holding 2 hours of material? Granted,Yanni did not play just 65 minutes of music that night. People would have rioted afterwards. Why do we get shorted because we were not there in person? Perhaps the idea was not to include the same old songs that are on other live dvds..........SO WHAT?  Put them in!!!! Who cares if 4 or 5 more songs on this dvd were also included on the Acropolis release or the Royal Albert Hall or the Taj Mahal. Please include them. You can't say that they would sound the same. For instance, Yanni's band is only a third of his earlier ensembles because of not having a full orchestra present.<br />That would guarentee a different sound. You also have a choice of playing songs you never have included in any video.<br />Does anyone really mind if the 4 or 5 extra songs would be just piano solos? Not me. I just want the ENTIRE CONCERT.<br />Also do not care for the individual selections such as when Yanni lets the cello player play so long it puts you to sleep. Don't mind showcasing an individual's talent as long as he or she is accompanied by the rest of the band, but on their own? Not for me.<br />Yanni has two songs that are about the same as both are just rythmic beats and go from artist to artist to show off what they can do. One of those was enough. Two were hard to take. Attempting to play songs that we are used to hearing with a full orchestra left it sounding very thin.<br />Overall rating for me was a 5 out of 10
B008HK3XU4|3.0|This is a pretty good case. I would personally like to see a skinny sleeve on the outside where I could store my stylus. Also, there's nothing on the flat surface to keep the kindle from sliding when you're trying to watch something. Sometimes it seems to slide more than other times. Puzzling. I've been using it since I got the kindle fire hd in September, and the corner grips have held well so far. So,again,I'm just saying, it's not perfect, but it's pretty good.
B0085Z3B2Q|3.0|The blu-ray and DVD were in great condition, but there was no digital copy as the title listed. Email I sent before purchasing, to ask if it was really included, was never answered so I purchased it just hoping it would be. I did get the item for a great price and received it very promptly.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Good movie I liked it. wouldn't be the best I would say but I did like it and would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Every bit as good as the 1st book of the series! Currently im about 60% done w/the 3rd & last book & each one of them are fantastic!!!
076115678X|4.0|A lot of great tips for maintaining curly hair and great recipes for hair solutions. A must have for someone with curly hair.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great storyline! The ups & downs really holds your attention & makes it a real pageturner! This is one i will reread several times!Even better than the movie! But since i had seen previews for the movie the characters had faces while I was reading which did make it really great (zac efron) LOL!
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|It was a bit long at the end of Part 2.  Part 1 had me wanting to read more.  I was told it was wonderful, but I found it just OK.<br />I had read Gone Girl and this did not measure up to that at all.  Strange story.  Part 3, the ending was disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical going into this book. I prefer books that have possible storylines such as James Patterson, Sue Graften, Nora Roberts, & Nicholas Sparks. Im not into fantasy, harry potter, etc. However, when Twilight caused such a raucous I decided to check it out & I loved it! So I figured i may as well give this a chance too. But I knew just as I did w/the Twilight series, I wanted to read them before seeing the movies. Once again Im enthralled w/these. Im about 60% done w/the 3rd book right now. Once Im done w/these Im going to try the 50 shades trilogy.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This was yet another example of creative liberty gone wild...  better said.... the book is better than the movie!  One can only say that if you even remotely enjoyed the movie... and you can read.... READ THE BOOK!  I give it a one star based entirely on the premise that it was a good story.  The problem is that they left 2/3's of the story out... leaving the viewer with lot's of questions... or \\"holes\\" in the plot.
1451638450|5.0|Great story that works as a stand-alone story but is even better if you \\"know\\" some of the characters from previous books in the series.
B007EDYN36|5.0|I have admit, I was very excited to hear that Peter Criss was writing a book to tell his side of the story of his years in and out of KISS.  I've been a KISS fan for 25 years and as of late all you hear is Paul and Gene's side of the story which usually involves bashing Peter and Ace.  With this book you get Peter's versions of events that took place inside and outside of the band.  You see how basically Gene and Paul run the show for KISS and always have.  Peter struggled with his demons but most people in his position and level of success did.  Gene and Paul have carried on KISS but with their version of KISS and the energy of the original band cannot be topped.  You see how when the reunion was starting to take place how Gene especially simply had dollar signs in his eyes and used both Ace and Peter for his own gains.  Peter has come a long ways and seems to be in a good place now.  I highly recommend this book for those of you who are KISS fans and would like to hear another version of the events that took place instead of the venom that Gene and Paul constantly spew.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I stood in line for almost two hours on Black Friday 2011 to get my Kindle Fire.  My husband was dead set on getting it for me as an early Christmas present.  He swore i would love it, I wasn't so sure...but whatever.<br /><br />He was right on the money!  I LOVE my Kindle Fire.  It comes with me on every road trip we take, every vacation we have been on since I got it.  I read books on it, play games with my boys on it, and even surf the web in bed at night.<br /><br />So, I want a case that is going to protect it.  Shortly after I bought it, I purchased Built's Neoprene Sleeve and for the money, it was an excellent case.<br /><br />And then I saw this one.<br /><br />First let me say, I love the color.  A beautiful, striking red.  I'll be honest, at first I didn't notice what the writing was, I just liked the look of it, and when I received it and my kids looked at it, they pointed out that the writing was actually countries.  We've been to a few (Grand Cayman and Cozumel to name a few) that are inscribed on the cover, and for some reason I dig that.<br /><br />Second, My Kindle Fire fits inside nice and snug.  No worries about it sliding out, or anything of that nature.  I do have a screen protector on my device, and though the cover didn't close completely at first, I simply put it 'upside' down for a few days, and now...no problems!<br /><br />This is a beautiful and supple leather as well, soft to the touch, and I've had it a month and use my kindle daily, so it is handled often and it is wearing beautifully.<br /><br />I think this is a wonderful product for the price.  You get a beautiful, leather cover for less than $50-great deal in my book...or should I say, my Kindle.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  If you like John Grisham's books, you will like this one, too.  The ending was a surprise, but books with a twist are more interesting.  Could hardly put it down.
B009LL4LMM|1.0|Seriously, this may be the worst yet for a game. I'd love to hear Concrete Software's reasoning for these permissions.
B009KYXEY6|2.0|I am a huge Lana Del Rey fan, and I have Born to  Die, and I purchased this to get Paradise and the 3 songs extra on Born to Die. I was extremely upset when I put it in and the three extra tracks \\"Without You\\", \\"Lolita\\", and \\"Lucky Ones\\" were not on the CD, but are still shown on the back of the case and inside the album pamphlet.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I watched this with my husband. Has a lot of action which being a girl I am not all that into. But over all it is a pretty good movie
B003XF1OJK|4.0|This book is great but there are things that you wouldn't understand if you have never played halo. I suggest playing halo 1 (combat evolved) first. Overall a great read!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I just got in the Twilight phase and I have to say I am sad that I didn't watch these movies sooner!! I will definately be waiting for the newest one to come out. They are just the right amount of love and action so its a good movie for the whole family!

B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a fabulously written book.  A lot of history that appears to be very factual. I have really enjoyed the first two books of this trilogy.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I have seen the movie dozens of times.  And, recently went to the play.  So in the spirit of halloween I thought I would read the book.  I enjoyed the book so much more than the Hollywood version of the story.  The love story always seemed out of place.  Also, the detail and depth of the book was so much more complex and compelling.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was amazed at the information in this book - written by a doctor but in such a way that I could understand every word. I am diabetic and have friends with Celiacs. I immediately withdrew wheat in any form from my diet and have found that's it's true, I don't even want to eat anything after dinner now (my worst time for over eating of the day) While I haven't had a great weight loss yet, my daily glucose readings are excellent. Definitely a book everyone needs to read and follow.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Love it. Works much faster then the factory browser that's on my tablet. Easy to use and not at all complicated. I used Opera browser on my computer and it was okay, but the android is great. Comes highly recommended.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son has been talking about Star Wars and since he's only 4 can't watch it so when I saw the Angry birds Star Wars I thought it would be something fun to share with him.  I was disappointed to see that the free version is not available on my Kindle Fire (1st generation) but because I enjoyed the other Angry Birds games too I paid the $2.99 for this one.<br /><br />Now I'm not a big fan, but I have watched all the Star Wars movies and get a big kick out of the pop culture represented with the Star Wars characters turned Angry Birds.  As someone who has played both Seasons and regular (and ad-free) Angry Birds games, I really like the new light saber and Jeri force features in the new game, along with new physics properties of outer space (I.e. different gravitational pulls).  It poses an interesting and new challenge to use these powers and you get the added benefit of the cute Star Wars backgrounds and short videos.  Uses a lot of true Star Wars sound effects too, like for light sabers and the Darth Pig that laughs at me when I fail a level!<br /><br />So I'm a 33 year old mom who downloaded this to play with my 4 yr old toddler and I find myself playing while the kids are in bed!  I was REALLY disappointed to see that a whole section of levels in the game has to be unlocked with purchase.  I didn't use the free version since it wasn't available so I actually paid so I expected all features to be included.  You can also buy more Falcon ships to try to pass more levels or get a Falcon high score.  I will not pay more for these things and I have a parental control set up so a pin needs to be entered to purchase in-app extras.  Again I purchased the app so I didn't expect added costs to be pushed BUT there aren't any random web ads as in other free apps which is great.<br />All in all it is worth every penny, as long as you understand there are levels you will have to purchase.  Developers have a whole section of levels that will be a free update at an unknown time it shows in the menu.  Love this game!t shows in the menu.  Love this game!
0345803485|1.0|This book has a lot of hype and I can not understand why. I did notice it has the Twilight personalities of Edward and Bella so maybe that is it?*May contain some spoilers*<br /><br />Ana is clumsy and sees herself as a girl who is not beautiful. She has never had any interest in a guy until she meets Christian. All the guys she is friends with are attracted to her and want to date her. She also thinks Christian is the most beautiful guy on the planet. She is always breathless/mesmerized when around him. She always thinks that he doesn't care about her the way she does of him. She can't understand why he likes her.  Sounds just like Bella to me. Also Christian can't stay away from Ana. He is overly protective of her and even tracked her cell phone number to get her location. Stalkerish much? He also gets very jealous when she hangs out with her best guy friend Jose.  These both to me sound just like Bella and Edward.<br /><br />After you get passed the first couple of chapters it is basically SEX. That is all I see this book. Explicit detail of the sex they have on almost every page. And when they are not having sex, Ana is thinking about sex, because everything she does even when she is not around him, it reminds her of sex with him. She also almost orgasms from anything. Even at a light touch from Christian.<br /><br />The book started out good for me, but then after I bought it and got more into it then it became annoying with how bad it was written and how the story line is.<br /><br />All in all I can not see how it became so popular and why they are making it into a movie.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was exactly what the title said a beautiful disaster, it was raw, and at times so intense and pure, it made my heart melt and smile, it also had me angry and wishing.. when I tell you, you'll fall in love with this story.. you really will. I enjoyed this story so much that it actually my second time reading it.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|This product is over priced for the size of the set, bought it for my son who loves minecraft and it's been a month and he has yet to play with it.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Easily one of the best, if not THE best Season yet! Dexter never disappoints! Dexter: The Fourth Season is a must see for all Dexter Fans.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This book although entertaining, the story could have been told in 1/2 of the pages. The end seemed rushed and disappointing.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|If you are a parent, you NEED to read this book. Please actively insert  yourself, as a parent, in all aspects of your children's lives.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|The subject says it all, I can't put it down till I beat it!  The physics are entertaining, potentiality the most fun part is after failing a flip you can pick the guy up and throw him around.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Almost as good as fsog. I didn't like giddeon as much as Christian or Eva as much as ana. There are just too many issues between them both.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|This quote is from my favorite part of the book, the last four stories that Munor refers to as the closest to an autobiography she intends to write.  In them she recounts a life with a humor and a depth of thought that reveal the thoughtfullness of her view of other people.  The quote above is her father's response to her revelation to him that she had had late night insomnia in fear of an impulse she had had that she might strangle her sister.  Munro was young, and clearly in no danger of homicide, but his considered answer is endearing and powerful and served to calm her.<br />I think Munro takes this view with her characters, along with her closing remark that we often say we will never forgive ourselves, but we do.  In her stories, she chooses cameos of a life to examine in spare but rich language that allow us easily to picture both the narrator and the subject.  So often love or connection comes so close, only to falter in a minute.  The sudden veerings from the lives of relationships are fairly harrowing to me however.<br />Best I like the stolen glances at the heart of a conversation or look.  In her autobiographical \\"night\\", she talks about the sight of a young girl sitting on a stair bemoaning the unfairness of an occurrence at a dance.  It develops that she was a young prostitute made not welcome, but the salient feature to Munro was the crooning of the young soldiers that all would be well.  One can summon the deep longing of a young girl to be the subject of that consolation.  These glimpses are the things that make me hold this group of stories in high regard.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I was curious as to what the hype was about...so I bought the book.<br />I am not one to read about homosexuality, rape and child molestation, so this was not for me.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is one of the most riveting historical pieces ever written about Lincoln and our country during that time.  The wealth of information is just unbelievable.  If you enjoy history, you must read this book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was recommended to me by my coworkers.<br />It is a story of different perspectives...what he thinks...what she thinks.<br />There is also a little craziness...or actually ALOT of craziness involved.<br />Not what I would normally read, but I enjoyed it just the same.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Jurassic Park is a movie legend. It set a new standard for special effects and suspense. I remember how everyone freaked out when this movie was new in theaters. I think I went to see it at least 5 times. Every time I left the theater I was practically shaking from excitement. Excluding the ever boring Jeff Goldblum this film has amazing acting. The soundtrack is also one of the most famous movie scores of all time. The scenery, action and drama are all incredible as well. This movie is a legend. I know I'm preaching to the choir, but if you haven't seen Jurassic Park, then you need to as soon as possible.
1442346272|5.0|Apart from he fact that the book is well written. It is a must read, it helps you understand how Steve Jobs has changed our world. Thank you he was so adamant to get things right for the user. Hope Apple can keep it up.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. plays Iron Man wonderfully. I have never been a fan of his, but I was very impressed by his role as Tony Stark. This movie has boat loads of action, suspense, and drama. The supporting cast is also amazing. Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow are awesome. This is one of the best superhero movies I have ever seen. It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and leave you speechless. It would be a shame to miss this movie.
B0012GMY64|5.0|The cd is exactly what I wanted. I knew what I was getting as far as the music is concerned because we used to have the record album with the same songs. It was always one of my favorites. It is a good cd for anyone who loved Andy Williams. He will be missed.
B00008EY9G|3.0|This movie is about a group of strangers that meet at hotel by coincidence. They are trapped there by a storm and cannot leave. Unfortunately a killer is among them. As their numbers dwindle, the trapped victims are forced to trust no one except themselves. The truth will shock you and leave you saying, \\"oh it's one of those movies\\".<br /><br />This film is very different, but it's nowhere near being original. I'll just tell you what the deal is since the movie isn't all that spectacular. The people trapped at the hotel are actually figments of a schizophrenic murderers imagination. A doctor is trying to get the man to mentally kill all the conflicting personalities within him in order to discover his true self. So the events in this movie never actually happened. After the doctor believes he has isolated the man's real and harmless personality, they proceed to haul the guy off to jail. Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful and the dude kills the police transporter and gets away.<br /><br />That's it. I wouldn't bother to watch this movie. It's not great, but it's not bad either. The whole multiple personality killer thing has been hashed to death. This movie is just a carbon copy of a bunch of others. Not to mention Ray Liotta is a terrible actor. You're not missing anything.
B009LL4LMM|1.0|Lets see, you want to know when i start up so you can be running.  You want to be able to look for internet on your own so i dont have to tell you.  Then you want permission to be able to automatically open internet connections without telling me.<br /><br />If this app did my taxes, reminded me of important dates, and also made me a nice home cooked meal every night, i still wouldn't allow an app with permissions like this.  If this were on my computer, id ban it for being spyware.  But lets make it an app, put it on phones next to EVERY contact, email, phone number and address i have ......and thats some how ok?<br /><br />Seriously,  DO NOT DOWNLOAD this app.  Developers can not get away with such invasive permissions.
B00004RFFS|5.0|In an empty room in San Fransisco a reporter awaits his visitor. The man who meets him is a vampire. The vampire starts to tell the story of his life. This is a story of all the glory and loneliness experienced by those who are undead. This is a very powerful movie. It explores the psychology of a man who can never escape his regret and solitude. This is one of the best vampire films I've ever seen, if not the best. It's spectacular! You need to see this film.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I am so excited to read just about everything from this author! Including the rest of this series. The wickedness of the whole society pulled me in but Drizzt kept me there with his struggle.
B004LWZW24|4.0|After moving into a new house a family of 3 discovers that there son has become very ill and a dark presence has overtaken their home. They move again only to find that the spirits have followed them. After consulting a medium they realize that their son is the one that is haunted.<br /><br />This movie is a pretty different kind of horror film. It's not like this sort of thing hasn't been done before, this movie just has something about it that makes it seem different. It's not really all that scary. It does have some parts in it that will make you jump in your seat. The demon in this movie is pretty cool. He looks a lot like Darth Maul. Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie, and think any horror movie fan will enjoy it.
0307346617|1.0|I don't want to read anything like this ever again. The story was interesting, I mean, who doesn't want to hear about zombies. But the fact that the reader has to sift thru loads of information makes this book difficult and ultimately boring. A coworker recommend this to me...FAIL! I'll read for what feels like an hour, only to find I've been reading for fifteen minutes.<br /><br />I wanted nothing more to get to the end of this book.I'm sorry I paid full price for it. I recommend finding another more interesting/entertaining zombie book to read.
B00006FDCD|3.0|I have never been a big fan of this movie, or the novel. I have never thought a clown could be scary, but in this film it almost happens, almost. The acting in this movie isn't bad. I guess it's about as good as it could be. Overall I think it's pretty mediocre. You'll be okay if you see it, and you'll be okay if you don't. That's about the size of it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its a large awesome calculator that does everything I need for accounting at work and even remembers every problem so I can go back and review it. :)
B000063UR2|4.0|I have never liked Tom Cruise, but he has done a few good movies. Legend is among them. Tom plays a magical forest dweller that falls in love with a princess. She is captured by a demon lord who plans to bring about an ice age. Tom must save her and the world at the same time. He isn't alone though. He has the help of dwarfs and other mythical creatures.<br /><br />This is a simply magical movie. It has pretty good acting, special effects, story, and a great score. I remember how sacred I was of the Demon Lord when I was a kid. Having feared him when I was a child always made this movie very impacting to me, even 25 years later. I think this is a great movie for the entire family. It's a great experience. You don't want to miss it.
B0092D1V5Y|5.0|learn to read folks! and if you can read the try reading a description before you download an app. gah!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Clyde Shelton is a law abiding family man, and inventor. After his wife and child are brutally murdered an up and coming lawyer hands out a deal to the killer in exchange for his accomplice. Clyde isn't happy about the way the \\"justice system\\" functions. Like many of us Clyde wants to right the wrongs in our flawed legal system. He proceeds to track down and kill the man that killed his family. After being put in jail, Clyde starts killing many of the others involved in the court case. The judge and the criminal defense attorney are among his victims. The problem is that he is in jail. It's hard to commit murder when you're locked up. He is pulling it off somehow. His former lawyer, Nick Rice, is determined to bring him to justice. He learns how hard it will be after he finds out that Clyde was a CIA tactician and inventor.<br /><br />This movie blew me away. The acting, story, and soundtrack are all amazing. This film has action, drama, suspense, and comedy. It's pretty well rounded, and a major thrill ride. You don't wanna miss Law Abiding Citizen.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|I am a little over half way through this book and it is very informative and I have already brewed my first batch. Well worth the time and  money.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Any veteran of the war in Iraq will tell you that this is not an accurate depiction of the way things are. I can, however, tell you that this movie is entertaining. It has great cinematography, acting, and special effects. Much of the dialogue is also very powerful. Even though my experience in that lousy place was totally different, I can still appreciate an entertaining film. The major thing that I noticed was that the guys in this movie didn't act or talk like soldiers. Whatever, they did a pretty good acting job and I really like The Hurt Locker. I think almost anyone can find something to love about this movie. Definitely give it a chance.

0374531269|3.0|A Long Way Gone, by Ishmael Beah, was a surprisingly quick, page-turning read.  I wasn't expecting this, as it was assigned for school, but I really got into it.  It was not a novel that I would have picked up on my own to read in my spare time, but this kind of thing happens a lot with books that we are assigned to read in school.  I always expect to dislike it, but I end up not being able to put it down.<br /><br />  One of the things I enjoyed about this book was the honesty of it.  An author, musician, or any artist should always tell the truth.  And this book did just that.  Beah offers very graphic descriptions that meek authors may shy away from.  He writes about the terrible things he did, just to survive.  The brutal realities in this book are not sugarcoated, because if they were, A Long Way Gone would not resonate the way it does.<br /><br />  Before reading this book, I can honestly say that I didn't have a very good idea of what was happening in Africa.  I was just familiar with the AIDs epidemic, but one of the great things Beah did was paint a very detailed picture of an Africa I had never imagined before.  I didn't know this civil war was occurring in Africa, or how brutal it got.  Beah could go from describing a peaceful village to describing scenes of horrific violence, like a woman running and screaming with her murdered baby on her back.  This image is what I see when I think about A Long Way Gone.<br /><br />  Although I did like this book overall, there were a few things I didn't like about it; this could simply be because this type of book would not be my first choice to read on my own time.  The writing seemed distant at times, but the subject matter makes this understandable.  Beah didn't go out of his way to describe the people in his book.  His descriptions are wonderful and the book moves fast, but what's happening in the novel doesn't give the characters much background or personality.  I'm used to reading books with very strong personalities and character development, like Catcher in the Rye and Perks of Being a Wallflower.  I can easily relate to these books, and obviously most people that read A Long Way Gone can't relate.  This book was a dramatic change of pace for me.  This isn't a bad thing, though, because reading about a distant, radically different continent can teach about a culture through a novel, which to me is more interesting than simply learning about it in school.<br /><br />  Overall, I would give this novel a 7.5 out of 10.  I liked it, I didn't love it, and I wouldn't say it's my favorite book. In these boys' world, they have no control over what happens to them and are often at the mercy of other people or in extremely dangerous situations. This is an important concept in this novel.  The action surrounding the people in Beah's book dominates them, instead of the other way around.
1616202416|5.0|It's a story of a young girl and her young brother as they grow up under a strict father and discover themselves and their freedom. Set in Ibo-land, Nigeria, Purple Hibiscus is a well spun story full of suspense and intrigue. Kambili, through whose eyes and mind the story is told, starts of as mute girl with excellent academic credentials and by the end of the story she is in love with one she will never possess, has discovered her voice through her association with her cousins in Nsuka, and has &#34;lost&#34; her brother through her mother's brave but misguided attempt to liberate her family.<br /><br />This is certainly Ngozi's masterpiece. You will not regret ever reading this story.
B009YU62H2|3.0|Got it for $4.  Big fan of Superunknown. Seems like they have taken a step backwards after each album since.  Maybe its that I had too high expectations, especially since black rain was such a gem of a single.<br /><br />In ranking of the latest albums from the latest \\"90's bands\\" that I have purchased (Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Alice In Chains[added], Red Hot Chili Peppers), I would unfortunately rank this last.  Will listen more than the 10 times through the album and update as necessary.<br /><br />Had hoped Chris Cornell would have brought more to the album after his experiences with Audioslave and his solo albums.  Worth the $4 for the album.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works great but wish it came with original Fire purchase, or was told I needed it to download USB books.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Excellent action film. This film has a lot of cool guy fights and is a modern 'super action' film similar to the action blockbusters of the 1980's. It has a modern setting and stars many action film superstars. The choreography of the fight scenes is fantastic! Non-stop action fills the screen as the good guys try to win. A must have for anyone's action film library!
1423140605|5.0|Loved it, it was everything that I expected it to be and just an amazing read. I really enjoyed finally hearing from Annabeth but I must say, Rick Riordan, GET HOUSE OF HADES OUT NOOAAAW :D
B004GYY714|5.0|I downloaded this app just prior to a hurricaine so tht I would have access to weather and news info. during a power outage. It functioned far better than I ever expected. I was even able to lock in local favorite stations, and cue them up quick.  The sound quality was crystal clear! I can't believe such a great app is free.  You'd be wise to jump on it and get this fantastic app.!
B00867GKIK|5.0|If the first ten minutes of \\"Up\\" don't tear at your heart, you aren't human.  The opener is quality filmmaking in any medium -- truly marvelous stuff.  Happily, the rest of the film unfolds just as creatively, with some of the finest storytelling I've seen in a long, long time.  Pixar's graphics work is stylistic and skillful.  Its the one area that you have to respect in any Pixar film.  However, in \\"Up\\", the graphics support a powerful, moving tale about an elderly man who has lost everything and a young boy who is troubled by a broken family.  Typically, 5-star reviews are overused but in the case of \\"Up\\", its well deserved.  I very highly recommend this film.
B007EECSFA|5.0|After reading several Kate Morton novels, this is her best yet.<br />It grabs you from the start & keeps you guessing to the end.
1421550644|5.0|I have wanted this manga for years, so when I heard that Viz was re-releasing it in this two-volume set, I immediately pre-ordered it.  And I was not disappointed.  The box itself is beautiful and well-constructed, and the two volumes are absolutely gorgeous.  The set also includes a small, double-sided poster, perfect for any fan of the series.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|One of my favorite Coldplay songs.  This title song of the 2008 album, is uplifting and will put you in a great mood.  You will find yourself tapping your toes.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I have only got the sample so far but loved it.  I have read all the other Wimpy Kid books and loved them all so I don't see how Jeff could mess up on this one. If you haven't read any of the other books then I suggest reading the sample first because noone knows if you will like the book or not. You do not haveto read the books in order because they are all different stories about Greg's life. This book is a hilarous novel for kids and adults.  I suggest you read it.
B0099G3I96|4.0|This is a solid return to the Old School No Doubt that most of us know and love.  I enjoy most every song.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app to have.  I use it everyday and never have a problem.  Very easy to use.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Jonny Lee Miller is magnetic and twitchy and I love it. The rest of the show needs to match him in character and quirk and it doesn't yet. It's a standard CBS crime procedural with a quirky male lead. Give me some grit, CBS! Let Lucy Liu be just as brilliant and quirky. Put more money into the Production Design so I don't feel like I'm watching them act against an Ikea catalogue instead of my beloved dirty, gritty NYC. Give the Production Design the HBO treatment. And about this whole 'they will just be friends' stuff, that's fine for now, but eventually, please ship them, show. Go all X-files/Castle on me.<br /><br />So 3 stars for Jonny Lee Miller and his awesome skillz, and 1 extra star for my hope that this one will get better with age.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The Marware Vibe Standing Case for the Kindle Fire HD7 is by far and wide a very good value. It not only looks great, but it works great. I say, \\"Get one.\\" Thank you.
B006MPKDD6|3.0|Concrete blonde is actually a very good read. I have read most of Michael. Conellys. books and to be honest until Milky Haller was introduced i was tired of the moody<br />and predictable Harry Bosch.<br />However at least this book has more depth and the entwinig of a case and a court trial makes the book a little intriguing . Im still sold on anything that Mickey Haller is involved in but this is definitely one of Conellys readable Bosch stories .
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Another great read that had me hooked into beleiving one thing only to find I had fallen into the trap that Grisham had planned for the reader.This book is as good as he has written. A master storyteller.
B009EANE3M|5.0|What an Awesome album. I love the script! I think it is Definitely as good as the previous albums. I highly recommend!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I think this book definitely shines some light on mental illness. Which is a good thing because mental illness still carries a stigma. Pat Peoples is a very broken man and I really enjoyed reading his story. It felt honest, genuine, and real. It was funny at times and dark at others. A good, quick read. I hope that the movie does the book justice.
B007TK77QE|2.0|Casual Vacancy reads too much like a daytime television soap opera. I kept waiting for the real story to kick in. The plot highlights today's preoccupation with mundane gossip. But the door has been left open for at least another three editions of pap.
B007KOMTUI|3.0|This season seemed to bog down compared to others but still interesting and worth watching. Seems like the writing team is running out of steam.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Corey has to be my favorite character. Love his wit, he says what most people only think. Having said that,The Panther is not one my favorites from ND. I was hooked, as usual, but something was missing. I would still definitely recommend The Panther.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I love the movie, saw it in theaters had to see it again. Perfect mix of humor and action, I would highly recommend this movie.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|awesome movie, great price, you wont regret getting this movie and if you do your are crazy, it was just epic
B0071AKB38|3.0|everything about this is very good but the one thing that was terrible is the open and closing. first day i got it, it broke. it is only held be a few tiny plastic pieces and they broke really easily.
B008KL2ITW|4.0|Another book I couldn't put down. Romantic, keeping you guessing will they or won't they right until the end. I would have liked a bit more towards the end as thought it was a little rushed but will probably read again and am looking forward to the next book x
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is the best De Mille's character. His witty dialogue (and thoughts) keep the reader constantly amused. Wish there would be more stories with this character. Otherwise very interesting reading about Yemen, CIA involvement in Middle East. Highly recommended!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is amazing. Its an inspirational book that will make you think the whole time. I read the book in two day and couldnt put it down. I saw the movie first but that didnt matter. It truly make you think about your life.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|this looks like a rip off of minecraft.. and yes please add more time to the demo. good game though.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Even though some heavy hitters in the film, not best by all involved.  Wanted better storyline and plot.<br />It filled the silence for an evening.

B007LB2B3K|5.0|Like all of Volbeat's albums, just amazing. I have heard of Volbeat 3 years ago. 1 year before they started releasing their singles in the U.S. with Devil or the Blue Cats song, and been hooked ever since.
B0095J0AL6|4.0|I orderd this in october and I am not getting it till the 19th but i listened to it and it is AWESOME
B005H9B44A|2.0|well, THOR got many beautiful animations, and is really well done...but i think the story is not so inspired.....THOR may please the people who enjoyed HULK and CAPTAIN AMERICA, but the lack of inspiration on the story is huuuuuge....in fact, almost ALL the MARVEL movies are the same in this way.....Great images but no story...too bad, the MARVEL characters are TOTALLY CLASSIC!!!!!!stick with SPIDER MAN and X-MEN, the best from the catalogue of MARVEL movies.....
B0098460O4|5.0|I agree with some reviewers negative comments about \\"The Prayer.\\" Jonathan's role in the song is less than the BGT performances. But, Charlotte's role is every bit as great. This makes \\"The Prayer\\" an average song. The \\"Caruso\\" recording is just as good as the semi-final performances. These two songs play a small role compared to the others on this CD!<br /><br />  The pop remakes are absolutely remarkable. \\"Rule the World\\" and \\"Who wants to live Forever\\" continue to amaze me after dozens of playings. You can actually hear \\"Rule the World\\" on youtube, but the recording on the CD absolutely blows away these live youtube versions.<br /><br />  I personally wouldn't buy this CD for \\"The Prayer\\" or \\"Caruso.\\" I would purchase the CD for the pop remakes. Like the final performance of \\"The Prayer,\\" these remakes will nearly move you to tears. Unbelievable voices singing perfectly rearranged songs.<br /><br />C
B005ZCXPP0|2.0|The story on CAPTAIN AMERICA is really not inspired.....Got a lot of explosions, fights but NO STORY.....well, in my opinion almost ALL MARVEL movies could had better storys.....The HULKs and this one are the WORST of all........NOT SO GOOD, NOT A GOOD MARVEL MOVIE!!!!! try Spider Man and X MEN, by far the best MARVEL put on movies!!!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read all of Ken Follett's Books in his previous Trilogy & the first in this series.  This is one of the most compelling & page turning books I have ever read.  This is a must read, not only for entertainment, but also for an enjoyable means of learning much about our history.
B008NAFU9A|3.0|Was pretty good ,something quick and different for me,wanted to try something short for first time reading on kindle it was not drawn out pretty good
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is awesome, you never know who is going to get killed next!! I've watched The Walking Dead from season 1 and it has had me in suspense ever since. Now that the group is a little more consolidated, it makes it even harder to try and guess who will make it through (if any) this zombie apocalypse.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|You can't go wrong when you purchase a book by Mitch Albom!<br /><br />My daughter posted on social media that she was reading \\"The Time Keeper\\" and I purchased it within a day or so. I took it with me on a business trip. I began reading on the plane, and simply could not put it down.<br /><br />The author takes you on a time journey across the lives of three people. While you know the connection is coming, you don't see it until you're supposed to. Father Time is able to control the speed at which time passes for him as he learns the impact of what he has created.<br /><br />In vivid detail, Albom describes the experiences of Father Time as he travels virtually unseen, picking up eons of knowledge at his leisure to bring himself up-to-date with the complexity of today's world. In the end, Father Time is able to provide the two characters just what they need (not necessarily what they want). In so doing, he gains a precious gift for himself.<br /><br />Riveting. Great reading!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Racketeer started a little slowly but finishes well. Its a clever and intricate story - but not up to the level of Grisham's earlier stuff like The Firm, The Pelican Brief or The Client. Reviews that said it was among his best were an exageration.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I admit I am not all the way done with the book while writing this review, but I really like it.  No horror, next to no \\"gross\\" and Stephen King is obsessed with being gross.  No one likes writing about \\"snot\\" more than him.  But here is this book, kind, gentle, loving.  Time travel is the underlying theme, but life in the 1960's small town is what it is about.  What a wonderful departure for him.  I hope he takes roads like this more often.  Now I finished it and am amending my review.  Stephen King talks a lot about harmonization and discordance.  What harmonizes for King is catastrophic horror.  He just has to go back there, that is his comfort zone, so imagining that nothing good could come from changing the past works for him. Negativity is his harmony.  Discordance in his case is being positive, as long as you understand it his comfort zone, you understand why his characters just have to go there.  Still thought it was a great book even though he had to take one last waltz through gross and catastrophe. But an author has got to do what an author has got to do.
B005LAJ212|3.0|This series had a great start.  However, this great start has proved to be difficult to keep going. Once the initial episodes had been shown the theme lost impetus, the story line proved untenable to substantiate a long drawn out series. It is difficult to keep enthusiasm going when the story line of revenge becomes diluted with episodes that really bear no relation to the main premiss of this series.<br /><br />On the positive side the actors develop their characters and are the only real reason for continued viewing. The writers have to come up with material that matches the initial episodes in quality or they will undermine the casts ability to hold viewer interest.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|$2.99 for a game, and there's only two levels? My 7 year old son had this solved in 30 minutes. You want $1.99 more for the third level? Sorry, my son was disappointed when I told him no. No more Angry Birds purchases (games or merchandise) for our family until Rovio gets back on track. Sorry, but we don't do in-app purchases, and remove those stinking ads from a paid game.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone Survivor is an excellent book.  It details the extreme training a person must go through to become a SEAL.  And it illustrates how unbelievably courageous these men are in fighting for our country.  It also describes the difficult terrain of Afghanistan and how different Afghans are as compared to Westerners.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the story line on this entire series I hope to see more from this author. Could not put the books down actually finished this book in two days
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  If you liked Fifty Shades of Gray you will love this.  I can't wait for the next one to come out.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this series and now I can watch it all the time. yay! three more words
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoy very few international writers, mainly because the writing style is different than what I am used to, as far as novel-reading.  I would have to say that Kate Morton is one of those exceptions.  Her writing reminds me of some of the \\"classics\\" that I used to stock in the book planograms when I was a book merchandiser for the North American book wholesaler, Chas Levy.  Her books make you think as you turn the pages.  I have shared her books with my friends, and they like her work, too.
157421327X|5.0|Thanks for having this book in your inventory.....I had searched all over with no luck!<br />I have found a new hobby thanks to you!
0449806979|3.0|Wonderful content, even better if you are a parent with Ameropean heritage. A strong recommendation as a read, EARLY in your childs life. Many of the wonderful common sensical principles should be implemented early rather than later. I regret having missed some chances.<br /><br />The readers fake French accent is atrocious. Every french citation is a fringe, I could not finish listening to the day chapter because the hundredfold reoccurring word for French day care \\"créche\\" borders on audio assault. Make sure you have good, smooth headphones.
B0086700CM|4.0|A real blast from the past. Absolutely maddening fun for all ages and easy to play for everyone of any age or ability. Better than a barrel of monkeys or elephants and twice as addicting with or without sound.how many more words do I need to add to this review before it drives me crazy.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this movie is really a heart felt story. a very insperational story and anyone who has a family and close friends would like this movie. i recorrmend this movie to everyone it has a few surprises in it as well.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|love this version. very creative, fun. wish there were more levels to play and more ships/vehicles to use. best version yet.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The author did a great job of keeping you on the edge of your seat!!  There were new twist with every chapter and no detail wad left unturned.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The movie felt like it had more than one movie in it. I liked the story, it was a different take on the story of Snow White. The movie took a darker tone, but it worked.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the game; am totally addicted and the ads don't bother me in the least. I try to beat the moves,especially because some of these times are so quick. This game keeps me happily occupied during wait time. My only negative is that it seems like the draws are set up for failure but then when I beat the game, it's all good!
B009KHCT94|4.0|So I wasn't expecting much from the movie. I definetly liked it. It was cheesy in the best possible way. I enjoyed watching.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Apart from being very sexy I'm dying to know all Christian's secrets, there are so much that i cannot put the book down. Never knew I could sit still for so many hours reading. Friends are thanking me for recommending the trilogy to them.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to start the next book!! The story just keeps getting better and more thrilling! One of my favorite series so far!
B0008ENICU|5.0|I love this movie! I'm a fan of Norma Shearer movies but in this one, Rosalind Russell steals the show. She is brilliant!
B0049VZ222|5.0|This was a very smooth transaction and makes it easy to view without a dvd player. I will purchase more videos in this way.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|I love this kind of movie. I have quite a lot of them and I watch them over and over. It is relaxing to grab a glass of iced tea and my favoite blanket or afgan and just run away from the tiresome duties of my day and watch a great movie. This was one of my favorites.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I am a big Grisham fan and have read most of his books over the years, but he really disappointed me with this storey. The plot was pieced together with little attention to details and relied heavily on the 'somehow it worked' fall back instead of creating a plausible series of events.  Grisham's use of the government which does not care about who's life it ruins theme is boring and just plain lazy writing. The result is a dull story line with uninspired characters.  His attempt to twist and turn the plot does not work because the storey is just too far of a stretch, and because it lacks credibility, the surprises fall flat. I like the usual Grisham underdog who prevails against all odds in the end, but this time it just did not work.  Skip this one and wait for his next book!
0385523912|5.0|North Korea and the lives of its citizens is a cipher - on purpose. The continuing horror is that these people have been so effectively cut off from the larger (and largely more comfortable) world, so that for the most part they imagine that their plight is the norm. One can only hope that somehow the rise of the internet will penetrate this darkness, give them a sense of how badly they've been had, and help them to overthrow the repressive Kims. But it seems unlikely, given the hideous level of want and desperation the expats here describe. There is another book out now about a young man who escaped the worst of the worst; a political prison in this hellhole of a country. Reading that and this,  I'm not sure that anyone outside of the favored Pyongyang community can possibly come out without profound damage. Genuinely revelatory and worth reading.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|Blu Ray is great! Come in the appropriate amount of time, plays perfect, and the movie looks great! I'm super pumped to have this in my DVD/Blu Ray collection!
B008RYN44U|5.0|GREAT ALBUM .......so glad I pre bought. totally worth itThis is classic No Doubt.  check out the track samples.  Its enjoyable beginning to end
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Lots of laughter and more than a few tears when we watched this film. It will be a yearly Christmas tradition at our house from now on.
0385535147|2.0|I really haven't picked up a book in a long time, but after hearing Grisham tout his book on a radio program I thought it was time to take the plunge . The first half of the book was good . Kept me intersested even though I felt I was reading on a sixth grade level.As we approched the climatic last chapters it felt really rushed. In all, the story doen't seem plausible. He could have introduced Aliens or Ghosts at any point and it probably would have fit right in .I'll try one more book by Grisham, if it doesn't pan out I'll be done with him.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If you liked the original \\"Alien\\" series, you will probably like this one.  Its a prequel with a tad more story behind it.  Keep expectations in check and you should be fine.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I think that it is great story, it's very hard to put down. The price was very reasonable too, I highly recommend it!

B000AY74OG|5.0|Thanks for sending our DVD so quickly!  It arrived in fantastic shape!  We appreciate it.  We bought it for a gift and it arrived just in time.
B0000542D2|5.0|The DVD Hard Day's Night was the Beatles first and in my opinion their best Movie. Their music kept getting better and better but their Movies kept getting worse and worse.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|As a fan of both the Le Carre novel and the 6 hour BBC version (starring Alec Guiness), I was a bit skeptical about this film. It didn't seem possible to reduce such a complex story into a 2 hour movie. But, I gave it a chance. I am very glad I did. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy is an exciting, tense, cerebral thriller. The director brilliantly captures the feel of the 1970s, the uncertainty of post-war Britain, the fear of a still-powerful Soviet Union, the claustrophobic and ego-driven good old boys secret service, and the desperate desire on the part of British intelligence to be a player on the international scene. The actors are, across the board, perfectly cast. Gary Oldman has rightly received critical acclaim for his spot-on portrayal of George Smiley, Le Carre's unlikely hero. But equally deserving of praise are Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, Colin Firth, Ciaran Hinds, Mark Strong, Kathy Burke and David Dencik. The film does take some shortcuts, and changes a number of plot points, which make the film more of a variation on the novel than an adaptation. But the main story-line remains intact. There is a mole in the British Secret Service. George Smiley, who had recently been forcibly retired, is called on to discover the name of the mole, and stop the hemorrhaging of secrets to the Soviets via Karla, Smiley's counterpart and nemesis. One may well ask: do you have to have read the novel to enjoy and understand this 2 hour abbreviated version? Well, when I saw it in the theater my wife came along. She'd never read the novel. But she followed and enjoyed the film. Anecdotal evidence, I know, but evidence. I have a preference for the 6 hour BBC production, primarily because 6 hours provides more room to develop the finer points of plot and character. As a repeat reader of the novel (and its sequels: The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People), I appreciate the depth and breadth provided by the longer version. Still, this version is highly recommended for both viewing and purchasing. One of the best films of 2011.
B008GFI418|5.0|The Musical genius behind the Beatles. George Martin also known as the 5th Beatle.<br /><br />The DVD explores his beginning through the Beatles to his latter days.
1419705849|5.0|hello...i love all these WIMPY KID books, and this one is just as humorous, touching, and fun..what a great series...and i did a PHONE INTERVIEW WITH JEFF KINNEY..you can hear it online...davids book talk...JUST spell that out and add the dot com..no spaces...hope u all get to hear it..he was great
B0000DJZA5|4.0|This CD from the Beatles came out 10 years ago. The only difference from this version and the original version is that Paul McCartney hated what Phil Spector did to the 1969 version by adding strings to the music. With Naked the strings are removed. I finally decided to get it only to complete my collection.<br /><br />I think that this music of the Beatles on this album really showed that the Beatles were beginning to break up. It was no longer fun to make music together. This album is my least favorite. But as Ringo put it, the next Album Abbey Road they got it together one last time before they went their seperate ways.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|What a delightful and entertaining movie - I've now watched it 3 times, and am still looking forward to watching again.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|My favorite comedy of all time. I went to get my DVD out of my original DVD case and the DVD was missing, my roomate probably stole it among other things.<br /><br />So I decided I had to have it again. Today anytime I purchase new DVDs they are usually Blue Ray, yes even comedies.
B0041KKYDI|3.0|To me, this movie was just OK.  It was well made, but  after about 20 minus, it quickly lost my interest.  There just wasn't much of a story or character development.  Afterwards I thought--there's a reason why Hollywood never made movies like this 50 years ago--who would see it?  I wish I hadn't seen it.  Slumdog Millionaire was 10x better than this movie.
B008RYN44U|4.0|It's nowhere near the greatness of \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" or \\"Return of Saturn,\\" but it's as good as \\"Rock Steady\\" if not better, and it's definitely better than Gwen's solo cds.
B009KKLQKO|4.0|I've ordered this DVD.  It may not be the entire concert, but it is all we have at this time and that's better than nothing at all.  Perhaps they release a \\"volume 2\\" at a later date depending on the sales of this one.  If no one buys this DVD, it is doubtful there will be any more later!  BUY IT and enjoy it.
B004L03B3S|5.0|The love of two brothers albeit half brothers was set aside by the story telling, the drama of the separation and simply just a great love story. I suppose the brother-gay love may offend, but the sort of love (sexual), fidelity and friendship transcended the \\"taboo\\" aspect. Get the kleenex out while you enjoy this movie
B005Z28M58|5.0|Great packaging and it was in the best of shape. The movies came in on time. Sucks that the series is over
B009VB97EY|3.0|This was an interesting movie.  I would say it was more geared to a younger watcher, rather than running on a treadmill.  The dance moves/performed were great, but I would not watch again.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I thought this book was poorly written and awful. I kept reading thinking at some point it would get decent but it never did. It just plodded along in an odd way. I felt no empathy for the main character and the other characters had no depth either. I understand they made a movie out of this. Why? Rotten Tomatoes alert.
B0063M22QO|1.0|I didn't like it on the kindle. Thought it was like the one on facebook. It's not.<br />Sorry I purchased it. Never playing it again.
1936891026|5.0|I've read countless books on procrastination (a tried and true form of the problem!) took endless workshops and tried to \\"will\\" myself into doing my craft.<br />I heard about this book on a webinar and decided to get it based on reviews and it's short length.  I am SOOOO grateful I did!!  I haven't let a day pass since letting \\"resistance\\" win; each day I've practiced piano as I always said I would, without resentment or it being too torturous.  This book really lays it out for you in an interesting, humorous, effective way.  I'm already into yogic philosophy/some esoteric studies which is about 10% of the book and I fully agree with all of it.  Who cares what you believe it as long as you do your work!  Cheers to mastering myself (so someone else doesn't have to).  A MUST READ!!!!!!
B009Z8HCR2|5.0|...and yet I felt compelled to take a moment to express the state of awe I am in over Deftones and their continual progression.  Over the years I have watched most of my favorite bands lose their signature sound with each passing album...until eventually I was mostly no longer interested.  Deftones, on the other hand, have never once disappointed me.  And with Koi No Yokan one could legitimately argue that it's their best work to date!  And considering their expansive career and the sheer awesomeness of their preceding albums, that's saying a lot.<br /><br />So let me just say a big, hearty THANK YOU to you Deftones.  You are an exceedingly bright ray of sunlight in a world that is becoming progressively dark due to the banal nature of the music that is being continually fed to us.  Keep on keepin' on my brothers!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great puzzle/game.  It is fun and addictive.  It helps me focus and think clearly.  The only game I have time to play.

0143106287|3.0|I confess: I was expecting a lot more from Persuasion. The premise of the book is interesting: it is the story of twenty-seven year old Anne Elliot. Eight years earlier, she rejected Frederick Wentworth, choosing her duty to her family over her love for him. Now, he's back again as a successful navy officer, and Anne thinks this might be their second chance. But he's courting the Musgrove sisters, and seems determined to ignore her.    It all sounds very interesting, and Persuasion is definitely one of Jane Austen's more serious works, but the writing lacked something. It wasn't that witty or that interesting in the end. Maybe if I reread it a little later, I'll like it better, but it just didn't draw me in like Pride and Prejudice, and eventually, Emma. I couldn't really relate to Anne like I did to Elizabeth Bennet or Catherine Morland from Northanger Abbey. There wasn't enough of Wentworth. The background history was kind of vague. I'm sorry to be critical of anything of Jane Austen's, but this one just didn't work for me.    Becky loved it, so I have to come a to a reluctant conclusion: We really don't have similar opinions on books. Books that I love she doesn't review, books that she loves I don't enjoy as much (generally.) Books that she reviews unfavorably I like. It's kind of sad.    Back to Persuasion. As I said, it's a much more serious work; it's not necessarily about young love and flirtation. Anne is still fairly pretty, but she has to face the fact that if she doesn't marry soon, she'll be an old maid. There was a lot less snappy dialogue, and overall, I think it's just an inferior book. I do look forward to reading For Darkness Shows the Stars, a science fiction retelling of it (review coming soon.)    All of my reviews can be read at my blog [...]
B007VUA7VO|5.0|really helpful and it tells me the percentage of my battery life.it also shows me how much power I have left. great app.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wonderful sequel. So good, I was mad at the author at times, but so happy with the ending!! Look forward to the next book.
B0015AARJI|5.0|the product completely meets my expectations in terms of price, comfort and use, it certainly was a good investment for me

B002BU0DPE|2.0|Mine starting to lose it's sound in both sides after 4 or 5 months of having it. This headset was not built to last. Hurts your ears after 2-3 hours of gaming and up as well.
B0012HRJEA|5.0|The modern setting what looks to be modern-day California; great score; awesome actors (Daines, diCaprio, Leguizamo); and original Shakespearean dialog make for a great experience to an old play. This version certainly reinvigorates the rather worn story of two star-crossed lovers.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The concept and cast was great and we loved this movie. I was impressed with the way they tied all of the Ironman, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor sagas together.  If you haven't seen any of the other movies you will still love this picture, it reminds you of Saturday morning Superhero Cartoons that we thought were fake.<br /><br />Now we know the truth, SUPERHEROS ARE REAL!! LOL!
B008FC4WA4|5.0|Very well written short story about a poor guy who just can't win.  You have to keep reading because you just HAVE to find out what happens next.  A Very good read!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent and most praiseworthy! This is one of the most useful and well designed apps that I have seen yet for Kindle. My 1st generation Fire does not miss a beat and I can monitor charging and drainage and see much battery info at a glance.  Good work fellows!
0786958731|5.0|I brought this for a christmas gift.  My grandson and son love playing board games so I am hoping they will like this one as well.
B0098VXE50|5.0|great movie i was pleasently suprised at how action packed it was as well as being visually stunning. i will recommend this movie to all my friends all though i feel that 3.99 is a pretty steep price for a 48 hour viewing, i think i may be entitled to a free movie viewing from amazon
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Koi no yokan is the best album I have heard all year and has now became my favorite tones album. Everything on here is just so expansive and the lyrics are nothing short of otherworldly as normal, it's as if the Deftones are the alt metal version of The Cure. It's great for late night drives the same way that Saturday night wrist and Diamond eyes are and as a long time fan it's a dream of an album. All the songs flow perfectly together in order from beginning to end so there's no need to skip anything you just put it on and relax. if you're a fan or someone interested in the Deftones definitely just buy it right now don't hesitate.
B009JCL58G|5.0|I'm a big fan of movie scores, and I must say that this is one of my top favourites! Even if you didn't see the movie, the Composers did a fantastic job getting the emotions into the music that the movie also gives you. \\"The Cloud Atlas Sextet\\" is a faboulus piece that lives up to the way the movie describes it to be. The best song that I can't stop listening to for it captures me is \\"The Cloud Atlas End Title\\". Over seven minutes does that piece grab and move you from beginning to end. Great job to the musicians involved in the making of a great CD!
B009RX85N0|5.0|They could not have put a better cast together. They are freaking adorable and talented. I started watching on netflix and loved it so much I bought the first season just to support it. Fun story that has you falling in love with all the characters both good and bad. Must watch!

B007GCY8FS|4.0|This is the 4th Reacher tale I've read and I a fond of Jack's \\"shoot'em in the face\\" way of dealing<br />with his adversaries. This was not my favorite of his adventures, but still a good read.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|This is a beautiful compilation of music; I bought it especially for the piano numbers that are incredibly relaxing and hypnotic. They take me away each time I listen ...the music is just as wonderful as the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|9MB app for a simple calculator. I can live with it if there's not the annoying Amazon ads banner on the top. I uninstalled after 2nd use.

0345803485|4.0|If you are looking for a book to get your motor running, if you know what I mean, this book will do the trick.  It's steamy!  If you are looking for realistic characters and a good plot to go along with your smut, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />What the one-star reviewers say is true.  There's virtually no plot.  The dialogue is wooden.  The story moves slowly. The characters are sooooo unrealistic.  A 27 year old self-made billionare who is drop dead gorgeous, hires women only if they're blonde, pilots his own helicopter, loves classical music and is a wonderful pianist, lives in an ultra-modern penthouse, is fighting famine in the Sudan, and is also extremely emotionally damaged and a master of kinky sex? Seriously??? A woman (a virgin, of course) graduating from college in 2011 who doesn't own either a computer or a smart phone?  Really????  This book is filled with chiche after cliche, unrealistic characters, lousy dialogue, and factual errors.<br /><br />And yet......  I couldn't put it down!  After the first few chapters, all the negatives didn't matter. The book sucked me in and I really cared about the ridiculous characters and their emotional/sexual issues.  I don't normally read erotica, so I can't properly evaluate it on that basis, but I thought it was pretty darn hot.  This book ends with a cliff-hanger and I'll definitely read the next book in the trilogy. I have to find out what happens next!<br /><br />Skip it if you don't want to read explicit sex scenes or if you're offended by the idea of bondage and dominant male/submissive female role-playing.  If you can accept that and get past the amateurish writing in the early chapters, you might find it to be a guilty pleasure.  That's what it was for me.  It's not great literature, but it was a lot of fun.  :)

B009Z8HCR2|4.0|I was taken by surprise that there was a new Deftones album in the works earlier this 2012. Diamond Eyes for those who experienced was nothing short of a 'Nu-Metal' Masterpiece. KNY may not be as 'Dynamic' and sometimes not as 'Loud', but that shouldn't give you the excuse to turn this album down!<br /><br />Like most out there, White Pony was my introduction to the group and the selling point was the Atmosphere that this band can and could create, that and Chino's piercing vocals! In my opinion 'KNY' is the next logical step from 'Diamond Eyes' this is an extremely strong record, and it continues to show Deftones push forward instead of living in the past and trying to duplicate their old material.<br /><br />This is like i said 'Extremely Solid Record' and the overall Sound that this record gives off is sheer brilliance, another stellar performance by everyone! Love how everyone is in their on 'Spotlight' so to speak on the album. KNY is another exceptional and outstanding release from one of my all time favorite groups! Its nice to see and hear that Deftones are still alive and putting out Memorable, Fresh and Creative Music.<br /><br />Koi No Yokan 4 / 5 Stars

1616960922|5.0|I had pretty high hopes for this one, being a Brandon Sanderson fan for some time now, but I was a little worried about the novella format.  Sanderson has a way with words, but that way usually involves a lot more of them.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the plot was not only well-written, it was done in a way that inspires.  A clever new magic system, engaging characters, and a strong sense of place: this book is Sanderson firing on all cylinders.<br /><br />I'd wish for it to be longer, but that would risk ruining the beauty of what he's done in this format.  So, instead, I'll wish for more novellas.

0316228532|1.0|As a fan of Harry Potter books, I was curious about the first\\"adult\\" novel by J.K. Rowling. It was very hard to actually like most of the characters in the book.  The writing and the subject matter are very dark and depressing.  I wanted to feel sorry for some of the characters, but most were so unlikeable that I didn't even feel sad when bad things happened to them.  I was determined to finish the book and I did...but I was not satisfied.  I somehow wish that I had the time and the money that I spent on it to use for something else.

B009AZZEU2|4.0|When Soundgarden reformed in 2010 and embarked on a tour the question was always going to be will they record a new album? Well the answer is yes and the even better news is that the album is very good and has all the hallmarks of Soundgarden's now classic sound. It might be 16 years since the band released \\"Down On The Upside\\" but listening to \\"King Animal\\" it doesn't really feel that long, it's as if we have been transported back to the nineties.<br /><br />Fittingly the album starts with \\"Been Away too Long\\" which has a trademark Chris Cornell vocal that twists it way over the music as he uses his powerful range to carry the song on which features a typical powerful Kim Thayil riff, it also features a nice bass breakdown at about the 2.20 mark. While Soundgarden have always been associated with grunge it's fair to say that their origins always lay with Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin as can be heard in hard hitting numbers \\"Non-State Actor\\" and \\"Blood On The Valley Floor\\" which are both riff heavy.<br /><br />As well as the heavier numbers there is a few laid back songs on \\"King Animal\\" such as \\"Halfway There\\" which wouldn't have sounded out of place on \\"Down On The Upside\\". There is the ramshackle of closing track \\"Rowing\\" which has more than a hint of Steve Earle about it. It has to be said that Matt Cameron's drumming is a superb as ever.<br /><br />It would have been easy for Soundgarden not to release a new album and to continue to live on their superb back catalogue but with album number 6 \\"King Animal\\" Soundgarden sound as relevant and as important as they ever did. It's great to have them back!

B008QTVNUI|2.0|I never finished the series.  While I know some others who really enjoyed this series, I found the main female character a distraction from the storyline.  Her storyline was a little over the top and hard to relate to.  Most people would have a hard time relating to her or her choices/actions.  Her actions were over the top, but not in a good way.  It was just too far-fetched for me (maybe because I'm involved with Federal law enforcement and have a security clearance and boundries?)Without giving something away that's all I can really say about the series.  I do, however, hope other people enjoy it.  There is some entertainment value with the other actors in the series; it just wasn't for me.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I really don't understand why this book is selling so well.  It's horrible.  I mean, for a work of erotic fiction or erotic romance it's horrible.  I like erotic romance and I've read tons of it, so I understand that something like that can be good reading even if it's not great literature.  But this isn't even good on the lowest level of reading entertainment.  First, the characters are walking cliches.  Anastasia - she doesn't think she's beautiful, guys only hit on her beautiful best friend, she's got wild hair that she's always trying to control with hair bands, and perhaps most annoyingly she's a literature major who's just passionate and dreamy-eyed over dead British authors.  Then she graduates and gets a job in a publishing company (honestly, it doesn't get any more unrealistic than that).  Christian is even worse - 20-something billionaire business tycoon.  Please!!  Somehow made billions, like Bill Gates kind of billions, by....what? Being a smart businessman?  I could almost believe a computer chip inventor guy, or a son of a business tycoon, but 20-something self-made billionaire is just a big fat hollow cliche.  And it gets worse - he's also a connoisseur of fine wine, classical music, and anything else hoity toity.  He's an 80 year old man in a 20 year old body.  And this self-made billionaire gorgeous man is completely taken with miss nobody English literature major who we're supposed to believe is really that beautiful (but no one has even noticed before) that he actually wants her.  And of course she doesn't want all his gifts and isn't impressed with his money.  Give me a break!  Big fat romance cliche.  And the sex scenes are nothing special - just boring internet chat room S&M, like the kind that normally has fat housewives playing dainty giggly subs.  Ugh and ick, I hated this book.  I read about 2/3 of it, but only because the very beginning, where she and Christian first get together, was good in a kind of classic romantic anticipation way.  But then they're an item and it's not so interesting anymore.  No matter how hard I tried I couldn't bring myself to believe these characters were real.  They are so derivative and unoriginal that I just couldn't suspend belief no matter how hard I tried. I have enjoyed literature about time travelers and cat people, but these characters were harder to believe than that.  I just don't understand why people like this book.  Maybe it looks better to people who don't normally read this kind of fiction - perhaps the cliches are not so obvious.  And one more thing - the writing style itself is not the worst I've ever seen, but one thing about it really drove me nuts - that the words \\"flush\\" and \\"murmur\\" are used at least several times per page, so that pretty much everything everyone says is murmured and Anastasia must have a medical problem because she is constantly flushed.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent read with continual activity leading to a surprise ending.<br />Grisham manages to write a very complex story and tie it all together to make it hard to put the book down.<br />Can hardly wait to find out what happens next.
0765316994|2.0|For me, \\"Redshirts\\" brought to mind the Saturday Night Live skits that are turned into movies. The five or six minutes of the \\"Coneheads\\" routines were often hilarious. The 90 minute movie was a dog. \\"Redshirts\\" is humorous as a Star Trek spoof for a short time, but the concept quickly wears thin. As the plot evolved, the fate of the starship Intrepid was found to be linked to a television show from the early 2000's. There were some humorous scenes in current day, Los Angeles, as the Intrepid Redshirts attempted to take control of their destiny from the television show writers. Overall, the writing was serviceable but not memorable. The characters were two-dimensional and flat.  These issues combined with long (and not tongue-in-cheek) discussions of nonsensical physics or philosophical paradoxes made the book a tough chore. I gave up part way through one of the boring codas at the end.  The concept would have fared much better as a short story.

B00005JKG9|5.0|When someone first recommended this movie and told me about it's premise, it sounded like it would be a bore-fest.  That was about 120 watches ago.  Adapted to the screen from the award winning Mamet play (now a play again on Broadway), Glengarry Glen Ross is film making at its very finest.  Razor sharp banter from a script almost word-for-word from the play, incredible performances from the entire cast (especially Jack Lemmon as \\"the Machine\\" Levene), beautiful 'noir' style cinematography  (the pouring rain background so prominent throughout the film that it could almost count as another member of the cast) complex, dark-lighted color expressions (especially the red reflections on the walls), and finally the subdued yet perfectly suited jazz score.  It's a shame that Glengarry Glen Ross did not receive the commercial success and accolades that it truly deserved.  I believe that Jack Lemmon's performance was easily worthy of an Oscar and should be considered one of his very finest.  For those who have not seen the play, now is your chance!  I just returned from NYC where I saw the play on Broadway starring Al Pacino  (playing Levene this time) and I must say it was very enjoyable yet I still find that he film trumps the play by a mile. No one, not even the great Pacino, can play Levene like Lemmon did!  So for those who have yet to see the film, \\"go and do likewise gents!!!\\"
B009AMANBA|4.0|Steven Spielberg seems to fluctuate between the serious (\\"Schindler's List\\") and the silly, such as \\"War of the Worlds\\", but in his new feature \\"Lincoln\\" he has come down to earth to present a realistic depiction of the 16th President during his last four months. Lincoln, with his skeletal physique (it has been suggested he had Marfan's Syndrome) and his reedy voice, was not the most elegant President we ever had, but historians believe he was one of the most powerful. Tony Kushner's screenplay presents him unglamorously but at the same time reveals the unusually strong character and the brilliant mind behind the gentle demeanor and the rural, sometimes long-winded anecdotes (not completely appreciated by all his cabinet members, the scenario makes clear). The picture doesn't open too promisingly, an obligatory battle scene, followed by Union soldiers quoting the Gettysburg Address from memory -- to its author! And as the story progresses, and Lincoln is determined to make his Emancipation Proclamation an amendment to the Constitution (it eventually took effect in late 1865) there are long scenes of conversations and confrontations in gloomy rooms, not exactly the type of thing to keep an average action-flick fan spellbound. (Regarding that gloom: viewers living in the 21st Century may have difficulty understanding how dark interiors were prior to the installation of electricity.) But Spielberg keeps things tense, partly by wisely  choosing Daniel Day-Lewis, probably the best film actor of his generation, to play the title role and having an array of excellent character actors -- Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, Jackie Earl Haley, et al -- to support him. The huge creative team of \\"Lincoln\\"  has worked hard to make the political story approachable for general audiences (it's rated PG-13 not only for its mature conflicts but for the harrowing scene in which amputated arms and legs are dumped into a trench outside a military hospital) and also to guide the movie away from clichés; for instance, the  assassination is not shown at Ford's Theater but is announced in front of the curtain at a theater where the President's son Tad is enjoying a pantomime. Altogether Kushner's script, along with Spielberg's direction and the cinematography by Janusz Kamiński (a great deal of it based on vintage photographs) bring Lincoln's world vividly to life. But feminists should be aware it's a very masculine world, scene after scene populated solely by men; and when it's suggested in session that women may someday have the right to vote, the whole chamber rears up, howling with horror.

1591844096|5.0|Seth Godin tries to convince the reader to became a \\"linchpin\\" in his organization as opposed to being a \\"cog\\".<br /><br />According to author \\"the linchpin is an individual who can walk into chaos and create order, someone who can invent, connect, create, and make things happen\\". The linchpin does not work to the manual provided by this boss, he invents his own map. He creates an art and gives it as a gift for free without expecting direct compensation. Compensation usually follows by itself.<br /><br />To became a linchpin one has to fight the resistance or his own lizard brain. The lizard brain tries to avoid any risks by fitting in, and the linchpin has to stand out.<br /><br />Everybody can became a linchpin if he decides to. However nobody can fit in and stand out at the same time - he has to choose to be either linchpin or a cog.<br /><br />I liked ideas in this book. I found them close to my own point of view. I liked the writing style, though sometimes it is quite verbose, some concepts are pushed too hard and topics are changed at a short notice. In the text and at the end of the book there are a lot of references to other books and web blogs. I found  them useful. Generally I liked this book very much.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|For the last decade or so it is quite difficult to find a quality rock album....Most contemporary 'classic rock' bands or the so called 'guitar rock bands' just don't get it...(Rubens, The Black Keys...come on!)....Most of the reformed old groups have been producing low quality music. \\"Afterglow\\" ..is the product of an extremely talented supergroup...

His sense of having to 'translate' the communications from pure instantaneous thought is what struck me as do 'familiar'.

B002R88G5E|5.0|I got this book after reading Khaled Hosseini's \\"The Kite Runner\\" (another 'keeper').  It is based on the life of two women in war torn Afghanistan in the 80s and 90s. The language and style of writing makes it an easy read, but the content is very thought provoking and gives great insight.  The story brings to life something that I only glimpsed on news programmes, and makes me appreciate the relatively simple life that I have. Having said that, it not depressing to read - shocking and emotional in parts, but it has wonderful, enduring characters. It also gives a better, perhaps simplified, understanding of the origins of the Taliban. I will never again watch a news report from a counrty at war, with such detachment.
1455527475|4.0|Enjoyed the book .<br /><br />My only complaint is that the book did not include the Op Ed and there was nothing in the book about GS reaction after the Op Ed was published.  I'm sure he must have heard something from GS.  That would have been interesting to know.<br /><br />I came away from the book with the feeling that Greg was a straight shooter and the story is basically true.  It clearly does match up with other books re the crash of 2008 e.g. The Big Short etc.
0399157565|1.0|I used to love Scarpetta books and eagerly awaited the next release. This last book the Bone Bed is the last one I will read. The last 4 or so books have been long winded and dragged on without getting to the point until the end. This book didn't even introduce the 'bad guy' until like the last 50 pages. Is there some bonus to having the book be almost 500 pages? This story could have been told in about 150 pages if that. More time is spent describing the procedures at the ME office than the crime. It was like a light bulb went on at the end - oh I need to add the bad guy and solve the crime now that I have gone on and on about the dust here or the description of the ME building. I should have stopped reading about page 75 but I was determined to finish it since I started it. It was a long dull task.

B007REV4T8|3.0|I rated this movie three stars mostly for the action scenes which there aren't enough of, otherwise I would have rated it two stars.  The usual big, unique, opening scene in the Bond movies doesn't materialize, we get an old hat car chase instead.  I don't know if the Broccoli's are getting ready to dump Daniel Craig as Bond, but several comments are made by his superiors regarding his aging and his retirement as a field agent which puts a damper on this film from the start. There are too many boring scenes where no action takes place and nothing interesting is happening. I'm not a Daniel Craig as Bond fan, he cannot carry off the debonaire, sophisticated Bond with the ladies, and he mumbles with a low voice, making it difficult to hear what he is saying at times. The witty quips Bond usually makes to the ladies are absent, adding boredom to the film. The villain looks like a big, buffoon, cartoon character who didn't fit the part. The screenwriting isn't very good, the dialogue sounded juvenile at times. The ending scene at Skyfall is ridiculous and so far fetched that it is laughable. The last criticism I have is for the theme song \\"Skyfall, sung by Adele, it is worse than terrible. I have some advice for the Broccoli's, Daniel Craig is not working as Bond, this film did not work, go back to the drawing board and retire Daniel Craig, get a hot looking, youthful actor (such as a David Beckham look-alike)who will appeal to both young and older viewers, surround him with new technology/stunts/current music, get better screenwriting, and you might get a great film.

I have been waiting a long time for someone of Mr. Ryan's caliber and style to come along. In a fairly saturated genre with more than it's share of derivative and over-the-top writing, Mr. Ryan provides some anxiously awaited substance, talent, imagination and creativity that is at the same time action-packed and subtle.

B0096I9UTE|5.0|[[ASIN:B0096I9UTE The Abbey Road Sessions, Deluxe]]<br />Kylie has blasted out the pop music for 25 years now and through the years we've seen her prove herself with smokey vocals on her World Tours but this album sees her really get to the roots of her music, which is music that can be sung many ways. Strip alot of the pop and add an orchestra and that's what you get on The Abbey Road Sessions! Sounding just as beautiful and now more seductive and sultry on some of the songs seals the case that Kylie is a true Performer of the time! Congrats on 25 Kylie...we hope you have 25 more fabulous years of sharing your music with us!<br />This is a MUST HAVE for any Kylie fan!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|From the first pages this book - it grabbed my interest AND  kept it, as it goes from the story of one person to another  ... all eventually linked together.  I enjoyed this book immensely, couldn't put it down and I read it within<br />a couple of days, it was that good!
B002VX0A40|5.0|My daughter decided on a nursery with a dragon theme!  Items have been hard to come by.  This dragon is very cute, seems to have a lot of stimulating details for the baby and I know she will love it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I chose this knowing it was family oriented.  I would reccomend all families to watch this DVD.<br />It was so real and was reality
