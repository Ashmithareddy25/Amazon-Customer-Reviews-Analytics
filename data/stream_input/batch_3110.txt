B000GUJZ4G|5.0|Point Break is a awesome action movie. It has everything you would want in a action movie. Surfing, skydiving, car chases. Everything.
B007SGM084|3.0|It took me a while to get to this series.  I'm glad I didn't buy each book separately,  I Don't know if I would have continued through to the end.  I enjoyed the innocence  of Ana and her adaptation to Christians lifestyle.  True, pure love does allow you to sometimes do things never thought of before. HOWEVER, I found myself skipping through several \\"scenes\\" as the became entirely too redundant. (really, \\"It's been over 24 hours since he touched me\\"... come on she went from a virgin to a nymphomaniac!) The over all plot was intriguing. Thank goodness for that little \\"who done it\\"  but there were some loose ends that did not get entirely knitted in to the story. I was surprised how the end seemed to dash around...the birth of Teddy seemed like a forgotten after thought, wasn't there going to be the wedding of her BEST friend in May....no talk of that between the \\"girls\\" did she deliver before,after,during?  I will assume her Dad made a full recovery.  etc.

B00EW9GQR6|4.0|I've often said that Lady Gaga﻿ writes better albums than songs. \\"Artpop\\" has affirmed this for me. When I heard the individual tracks she released as a preview, I was skeptical that I would like this album. In fact, it's quite solid, and I really enjoy it as a whole. It's much deeper than most people will probably realize and is arranged in a way that it feels like a concert... exciting dance-y intro, some solid building songs, some good ballads, a grand dance finale, and an encore. Overall, it's a great album. Give it a listen.
B002BEXFW8|5.0|best sound quality ever! a classic album given new life! worth the investment! don't pass it up! you will be happy!
B00B47NO2O|3.0|An average crime drama about a (surprise!) serial-killer mastermind who manages to create a following of other (not particularly brainy) individuals willing to kill for his cause and kill in general. At least part of his cause seems to be to lock horns against tough guy FGI agent (Kevin Bacon) who helped to put him in jail in the first place.  Pure formula and not necessarily a bad idea.  If you like your crime dramas to be mostly action: chase scenes, multiple who-is-going-to- kill-or-be-killed predicaments, graphic violence--you might enjoy this.  Nothing is held back from the audience--we have all the answers to who and why.  It's a matter of if, when and how the FBI--will bring down the cult of killers.  However, if you prefer more mental sparring between characters, intrigue and a more brainy story in general, you will find this to be clunky entertainment at best.  It is tiresome to watch the FBI always several steps behind making one dumb compromising decision after another.  The following itself seems to be a collection of dimwits and misfits who somehow are always in the right place at the right time to carry out the Mastermind's bidding--often having the uncanny ability to openly kill someone in a public place and then simply walk away from the crowd with no one doing anything to stop them (not one US citizen exercising his/her right to own a gun?).  Then there is the Mastermind himself for whom, other than a smarmy accent and smirk, there is no explanation as to exactly how he is a mastermind and how he is able to seduce such a well-organized legion while in jail without anyone who matters (like maybe the FBI?) suspecting anything. What seems to be his overriding purpose is to write a worthy book and win his wife back but it all seems so half-baked by the time he easily starts mentally unraveling.  Oh, and then there's the nod to his intellectualism--his love of Edgar Allen Poe and his imagery. A bit obvious.

B00AGKH7K0|4.0|In the 1960s, one of the most powerful rock songs for me was Eric Burdon and the Animals singing \\"House of the Rising Sun,\\" raw and powerful. Now, a new CD--\\"'Til Your River Runs Dry.\\"<br /><br />Burdon continues to be a fine performer--and a good lyricist. 12 songs on this CD. How do these work?<br /><br />A few examples to illustrate.<br /><br />\\"Water\\": A nice rocking tune. Burdon's voice still serves as a musical instrument (compare Keith Richards' voice now and then!!). Key line to me: \\"Water, water water; The truth, the shame, the liar.\\" And: \\"The enemy does not know who the enemy is.\\"<br /><br />\\"Memorial Day\\": A very political song. About soldiers. \\"It's a rich man's war but the poor will play.\\" Musically? Nice rhythm work. Burdon's voice works well.<br /><br />\\"Devil and Jesus\\": Provocative song. A bit strange with a slow tempo. \\"The devil and Jesus, controlling my soul. But I pay the toll.\\"<br /><br />\\"Bo Diddley Special\\": I looked forward to this, thinking that Burdon would use the Bo Diddley riff. No. Still, nice to listen to something of an homage to Diddley.<br /><br />Overall, a nice work, showing that Eric Burdon's creativity still exists. . . .<br /><br />Then, \\"The River Is Rising.\\" A slow tempo. \\"The river is rising; Carry me to another world; The river is rising.\\" Burdon speaks much of this rather than singing. An interesting song.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is an amazing story of intertwined lives and how adversity sometimes builds character and strength.  A definite must for readers who like a little history mixed in with their literary tales
B008P1EWIM|1.0|The graphics raved about by others comes at a cost.  A very prominent part of the display is the local time.  However, the time is not correctly displayed and to remedy this, you are required to buy an app \\"My Alarm Clock\\".
B003H4I4JU|3.0|The first book in the Enter series really hooked me.  I was enthralled and couldn't wait for the next chapter.  At first, I found myself a little confused with what was going on because the exposition at the beginning that introduced Ender's new story was REALLY detailed.  For awhile, I even questioned as to whether the writing style was the same.  Then it became more and more clear that it was another story involving interaction with a new race.  After a couple of chapters, I couldn't put the book down.  Really well written.  Enjoy.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's novels and this is one of his best. I couldn't put it down. Excellent writing.

B0065RIJ3W|5.0|I found this book to be well-written, logical and easy to follow.  That said, it's important to understand going in that this book is covering aquaponics from the basic background material and progressing through the available designs and their trade offs to fish selection and garden operations.  If you're looking to understand aquaponicsl and it's underpinnings,  this is a great read.  If you're looking for bill of materials and assembly instructions, that is available commercially in kit form or by looking up \\"barrelponics\\" on Google.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|honestly I'm 21 and I love this game the updates are awesome the minions are awesome I love the concept of the game completely awesome :) awesome is the only word I can think of :)
B002VRNR1Y|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to finally watch this movie. It now ranks in the top 3 of all time scariest movies I have ever seen. The other two, The Exorcist and The Conjuring. The Shining is scary in a different way. Nothing jumps out and catches you off guard, it's great camera work combined with a soundtrack that just creeps you out. A must watch for anyone who is a fan of horror films.
B00BYISRC0|1.0|The album is phenomenal! However, my experience purchasing the vinyl record has been quite terrible. I bought this a while back but have been so swamped that I haven't been able to open it up and play the record (been living off the mp3s in the meantime)....well, i finally got around to it today and surprise surprise I HAVE TWO COPIES OF THE SECOND DISC. That means my vinyl copy (that I paid $25 for!) is missing the entire first half of the album....EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!!
B008JFUS28|3.0|Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) leader of the Dark Elves attacks Asgard in search of Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) when she becomes infected with a powerful weapon. Thor searches for a way to save Jane, while wanting vengeance on Malekith. Vengeance brings Loki and Thor together as well, for reasons I won't get into.<br />  Thor 2 is unfortunately an uneven action comedy. That's right, I said comedy. Throughout the film it takes itself serious one minute and throws humor at us the next. It's as if they think every Marvel film now should balance humor and action, Avengers style. Which sadly made the movie pretty goofy. And reminded me of a disappointing film...like Episode 1, since I sat for awhile kind of bored waiting for it to become what I was hoping for.<br />  We have seen super villains who just want to blow *beep* up in the past. So yeah, Malekith is nothing fresh. And looks like a combination of something from Lord of the Rings and Star Trek Nemesis. Plus, we've seen enough cities destroyed in Transformers, the Avengers and Man of Steel to not be too impressed any more by cgi carnage.<br />  I also have to add the Thor and Jane Foster romance has always felt forced to me. All their scenes together add up to nothing in the end. Thor and Loki together again is what's fun. Kat Dennings (2 Broke Girls) is the most interesting woman in the film as Foster's intern, now with her...own intern. She reacts better to all the craziness around her then probably anyone else in the movie. Even a woman in a subway acts like it's normal when Thor walks in. Stellan Skarsgard is also fun reprising his genius scientist role but this time he has gone mad due to Loki's mind control.<br />  I liked enough of the movie to recommend it but I think Kenneth Branagh made the Thor universe much more interesting. With this director it kind of just trudged along, jumping from one scene to another. Iron Man 3 and Thor 2 are unfortunately just an \\"Eh\\" start to Marvel phase 2. Hopefully Captain America 2 is better.tain America 2 is better.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The idea to take found images and marry them into a story is brilliant. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. I am about to purchase the second book and I cannot wait to see what happens next. I had a little trouble with some of the handwritten notes and had to zoom in. No big deal, though. It's easy enough to zoom. Great story, well-written, cannot wait to start the next one.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game.  I've played it for years, but this version played on my Kindle Fire is by far the BEST! If you are able to see multiple plays at the same time, this version is quick enough to let you just click right on through them as fast as you can. The screen is highlighted so it is extremely easy to tell which files are able to be played.  ADDICTION AT ITS BEST!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|You picked up where A Time to Kill left off. I truly enjoyed this book and will miss the characters
B00CWY76CC|3.0|You reach level 10 and you have to wait for more. Been waiting over a month. Please get more levels and you'll get more stars. Other than that I really like this app. It makes you use your brain.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Ok beats, great lyrics, even better analogies. I'm not a fan of rap but Eminem is actually good, due to his ability to actually follow the music.  I can listen to this album all the way through.  Good as or better then the recovery album

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best game ever. You get to take care of your own horse and you can have as many horses as you`d like. You can even get a zebra or an unicorn. If your a horse lover you will love this game. It's just like you're taking care of your own horse. You get to feed, groom, clean the stall and lots more you can do with your horse. I bet if you get this game you will love it.
B007O4XX9K|3.0|Pretty good album it's no James gang though<br />He's down a lot better stuff in the past<br />But it was worth the money
0385537131|4.0|When you start reading this book, you realize - if you didn't already know - that John Grisham is one of the master story-tellers.  There's a difference when you read someone else's writing that isn't on the same leve as Grisham, Child, or James Lee Baker to name but a few.  This book has the rhythm that pulls you in from the first sentence.  Only a few writers can do that.  I've read others but when you get to the masters, you know it instantly.  I enjoyed A Time to Kill and was glad to be back with Jake.  While I don't think this book is on the same level as A Time to Kill, it is still a very good read nontheless.
B00GFOIUVQ|2.0|I have played the game on my friends i-pad but when I went to download it took up too much space. I like the game though just not for Kindle Fire.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This is a fantastic album. I never really liked Fallout Boy. I mean, sure. They had catchy songs. But this album really sold me on them. The lyrics are like poetry, and the music is catchy as heck. The final song featuring Elton John is a masterpiece.
B001MSMUH0|4.0|Who doesn't want to find their life's true passion. Ken Robinson tells us that each one of us has something which truly fulfills us as, we just have to allow for that self exploration so that we can find it and cultivate it. Truly inspiring!
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Alt-J had been around for nearly five years before releasing this album, working at first out of their dorm rooms and student halls. Supposedly it was the need to keep the noise to a minimum in these places that helped evolve this band's unique sound, forcing them to avoid using hard drums, loud guitars, or bass.<br /><br />It's difficult to pin-point their sound, which I think is often the trademark of really good bands, even though a lot of labels do sometimes come to mind. There's a sort of folk sensibility, but it's a lot more complex (and relies more on electro-synth backdrops) than that music usually is (or does). I've heard them referred to as &#34;art rock,&#34; but I have no idea what that is. I think the label was made up just to refer to bands who actually try to, y'know, be artistic, which is certainly the case here, although I don't know anymore what &#34;rock&#34; is supposed to be. This might qualify, since there is occasionally a serious pulse behind the songs, but it's never antagonistic or forced. The band has a trip-hop/pop feel in a few songs, but it never feels cheap or chewy.<br /><br />Lyrically, the songs are pretty profound and tend to be as inscrutable as any verses you might find in a Shins album. Regardless if the sound is upbeat or down, there's always an energy driving it that really hooks the ear, making almost every song seem like a contrast of itself, like the sweet and sour chicken of the music world. I, uh, I like sweet and sour chicken. If you don't, pick some other contrast you do like and go with that. Like salted hot chocolate or something.<br /><br />Anyway, the point is, it's an infectious and slippery album. It plays with the mind and heart while refusing to sit still long enough to be pigeonholed. Considering that nowadays cookie-cutter pop/rock is pretty much everywhere ad nauseum, it's a treat to find something so indecipherably beautiful still out there to be enjoyed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's challenging and quite fun to figure out. I can't wait for more levels in this game as it would be even better!
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|Probably one of my favorite games I have. It's kind of like Temple Run, so if you like zombies and Temple Run, I think you should get it! The graphics ate nice, and really it's fine how it is, doesn't really need much improvement.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I really, really enjoyed this book.  The first fantasy series I read was A Song of Ice and Fire and this was the second.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  I had asked people who read ASOIAF what other books I should read and this was one of the main suggestions.  It reads more like a set of shorter stories about the main character as the settings change several times.  Each of those stories was captivating.  I now check the Internet every week or so to see if there is a release date for the third book.<br /><br />I had the Kindle edition with Audible audio sync and I don't know if I can go back to having one or the other.  Amazon and Audible have figured out a great way to ensure that people buy these books as opposed to stealing them off of the internet.  This feature allows me to read in bed and listen at the gym or when mowing grass without having to continuously find my place.  Definitely pick up the audio narration and give it a try.
B005OUHOLY|3.0|Effortless MASTERY is full of interesting stories about the writer's own experience.  It has useful tips and exercises, and it offers quite a unique perspective on musical mastery.
1565847032|5.0|While no author, or scholar, or intellectual, should ever just be taken with a grain of salt (always do your own research, if possible), Chomsky at least opens more doors and windows (and, I'd hope, eyes and minds) for thought, than practically 90% of his peers. This book is, as others have said, a workable introduction, because of the plurality of topics discussed. For almost every individual topic, there are other books of Chomsky's to turn to for more depth. For overview purposes, however, this is the one.<br /><br />It's comprehendible, and comprehensive. If you dare even think the word \\"enlightened\\", this book had better be on your shelf.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|Like another reviewer said.  You are sad to come to the end.  It is tough not being able to see how a good friend is doing after following him through so much.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Anthem is a breath of fresh air after their last album which I wasn't too impressed with. If you don't own this album already, you don't know what you're missing. You will want to listen to it on repeat. I recently got to see them perform every song from Anthem live and they blew me away.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I can not believe where this book emotionally took me!  I couldn't put it down.  I think this was the best book of the trilogy and that is saying a lot since the first two books set a high bar of excellence.  I am sad to know that it it is over -and I don't want to say too much because it will ruin it for others- but the ending was NOT what I had expected but I so respect it! KUDOS  to Veronica Roth for being strong enough and brave enough to take the storyline where she did.  If I could give more than five stars, I would.
B00GI8AMI8|5.0|love love love this game!!!!! hraphics are nice...not too easy not too hard......can not wait to see other games by echo lake! !!!!!!
B00BUKODDO|5.0|This is absolutely first class. I have been skeptical regarding some of the previous Gary Burton's releases but this one has clearly exceeded my expectations. In addition to the vibraphonist, all other performers are equally great and have their distinct role. The music on the disk is full of new fresh ideas, nice, simple but intellectual. The sound is crisp and transparent. In some sense, Gary Burton gives an indication on the direction this kind of music should evolve. What else is left to be desired?
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I really enjoy playing this challenging card game! it's a solitaire game but with a golf twist and it's a great time killer!
B00BDAP66E|2.0|I installed the Facebook Pages app about 5 months ago. All was well until it started asking for an update. The update link took me to Google plus instead of Amazon.

B00138J234|3.0|A buddy of mine in high school used to wear a t-shirt of this album, and I always wanted to buy it. I heard that The Clash is pretty great. It's not in my taste, unfortunately. It reminds me of something that might play in the background of a car or a club, but I wouldn't sit around listening to these songs unless it was just white noise.
006202406X|5.0|It came on time and is all together a well written and thoughtout book. Great for young adults with strong characters that xan be both looked up to and related too.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Tis book was a great read, provides new insight into why humans run and the importance of running in the evolution of people.  The buildup to the race is exciting. The characters complex and interesting.  The race itself is a fitting climax.  The theories have changed the way I run.  I would recommend this to all runners, people with an interest in anthropology, and everyone who likes a good, well written story.
078513915X|5.0|Came on time and in good condition. Anyone who love the origional book will love this. The pictures bring it to life and it follows the storyline very well.
B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|This is an informative book, making almost comprehensible many of the cultural/religious streams of thought that create and influence the politics and movements in the cultures of Pakistan, especially the tribal lands. The ghost writing is evident in the reportorial style of writing but acceptable considering the nature of the book. Malala presents as a genuinely intellectually sophisticated young woman who is answering a call to human rights activism. She is already an impressive world presence.<br /><br />The real hardships and obstacles to even a modicum of freedom especially for women in the region are pictured with clarity. They are testimony to the passion and determination of the Yousafzai family to overcome and forward the education of their people. The father, and I believe the mother, are intellectuals in their own right. We hear more of the father's influence but I believe both must be given responsibility and praise for their exceptional child Malala.<br /><br />To experience the immersion in fundamental religionism and at the same time comprehend the violence inherent in the culture described in the book is almost overwhelming. It was not the first time and will not be the last time I have shuddered at the impact of violence; but the callous coarsening of everyday life that casual bloody violence brings presents a huge obstacle to the ends Malala Yousafzai seeks. Misogyny a distinct and softer obstacle is equally powerful in that it forms a major supporting structure of the religion fundamental in the lives of the indigenous of the area.<br /><br />This is a political book. I mean no insult in making that observation but noting it as a harbinger of a powerful woman emerging in the world's public arena; if she is permitted to live. I cannot resist  prophetic commentary. Not a focus of the narrative, but what is there confirms the irrelevance and futility  of empire and national power, with all its capacities to kill and intimidate and plunder, contributelittle worth while in the long arc of history. The conversation quoted with the late Richard Holbooke is telling.<br /><br />This is an easy and satisfying read that encourages the reader to give attention to, not only this young woman, but to those martyrs for civil liberties who have risked and, more often than not lost, all in the service of their cause.

B008JFUNKU|5.0|The hallmark of a great performance is if the actor can convince us that they are not acting at all, and have become the person they are portraying. (some Tom Hanks, as he has many times before, does just that as Captain Philips. He is every bit the captain of the Maersk Alabama, carrying out the mundane but important daily chores of looking after the ship and the welfare of the crew. One has the sense of the responsibilities on his shoulders and the distance he needs to keep from the crew.  Once the ship is boarded by the Somali pirates, we see the professional in his character, protecting the crew and his human side trying to stay clear of harm's way and convince his inexperienced captors that they are in something way over their heads.  The scene when Captain Philips has been captured is riveting and the scene when he has been free, Mr. Hanks remarkably portrays the emotions that the real captain probably felt.  This is a marvelous performance that demands to be seen.<br /><br />The same excellence is true with the actors portraying the pirates, even more remarkable that none of them had any acting experience. Barkhad Abdi is excellent as Muse, the leader of the pirates, as are Barkhad Abdirahman,  Faysal Ahmed and Mahat M. Ali. They are frighteningly unpredictable but also naïve and trusting when they should be doubtful.<br /><br />Direct Paul Greengrass does a splendid job telling this true story.  The story is moving and riveting. The scenes where the US Navy and Seals are engaged in freeing Captain Philips are told with military precision itself, with the audience being impressed with the professionalism and determination of our armed forces.  Captain Philips is a riveting drama that, even though you know what will happen, is a film you can see more than once.

B00DNVJ0IQ|5.0|DG's blurb, printed above, calls the Dvorak Violin Cto. the last of the great Romantic concertos, but it might more frankly be called the last to catch on. Heifetz, who recorded everything, ignored it, but Milstein recorded it, as have most of the modern virtuosos in the LP era. At concerts it seemed like a relative rarity in the past, and now that Anne-Sophie mutter is attracting high-profile attention to it, one still notes that no eminent conductor is on hand.<br /><br />Which isn't to denigrate Mangred Honeck's work here - he and Mutter have decided that what the Dvorak Cto. needs is oomph. They vigorously attack the opening movement, applying more force than I've ever encountered before - and it works. As lovely as the melodies are in this work (a gift that never abandoned Dvorak), the three movements can merge into a sustained gentleness and lyricism that only highlights a lack of development and structure. Here, when Mutter arrives at the middle section of the first movement, her marked slow down announces a change of pace from the punched-out first section. This added contrast, when you add her pronounced \\"personality,\\" is quite attention-grabbing.<br /><br />Indeed, the strength of this new recording throughout is Mutter's wonderful variety of tone and phrasing. She takes expression to an extreme - that's one of her hallmarks - but I can't imagine that the listeners who disdain her Mozart for its mannerisms will criticize the spellbinding atmospherics of the slow movement here. It's always been the dreamiest of Romantic interludes, very suitable for a neo-Kreisler style.  The finale opens with  a vigorous dance rhythm that sits oddly with the violin's highest register - the soloist has to be careful not to sound squeaky. Mutter speeds up the pace and provides flashy technique, which goes a lng way. Does she fuss with the phrasing? Yes, that's her being her. but the whole reading is pervaded with a sense of vibrancy.<br /><br />DG makes a point of the violinist rejoining with the Berlin Phil. after more than 30 years, and the orchestra sounds wonderful. (The cover portrait evokes her appearance as a post-Karajan glamour girl in designer chic  rather than being faithful to today.) The three charming fillers can't disguise that the total timing is short shrift, but to hear the once-ubiquitous Humoresque, which became carton music, is to plunge back into the ethos of Victorian parlors and potted palms. Mutter plays the wheels off the old thing, and good for her.ist rejoining with the Berlin Phil. after more than 30 years, and the orchestra sounds wonderful.

A sprinkling of comic relief with some of the zombie mannerisms, especially the mouth actions on a few. Excellent makeup and acting. I want to read the book now that I've seen the movie. Awesome deal on Amazon Instant Video - 99 cent rental!!! Go for the HD if you got it. The movie was fantastic on the big screen.
0143124544|5.0|Afraid to finish the book...wanting some miracle to happen...I could not stop until I read it in it's entirety.  I have never felt more emotions both at odds with each other. However,by the time I finished this book I was crying for days just thinking about the lives that were changed so dramatically and forever.  I thought the end was heart wrenching and yet destined to be, even though I prayed for some change of heart...It was completely understandable and a heart ache all the same. A book I will never forget anytime soon.
0143124757|5.0|John le Carre is famous for crafting novels of a moral complexity second to none, and this one is the \\"blue print\\" (if you will) and the one that truly rocketed him to fame.<br /><br />So what is the book about and is it worth spending your hard earned cash? If you enjoy spy novels then this one must be on your shelf. Without giving away too much, it is a masterful tale of morally ambiguous characters populating a morally ambiguous world. Unlike, say, James Bond novels, this one is not a physical action. The action is psychological, mental. The action plays out slowly, not quick, and there are no easy answers. Best of all, the actors do not rely on fancy gadgetry and amazing weapons. They rely on their wits and are human players in a totally human drama.<br /><br />Rather than go into a long review of the book, I'm keeping it short and sweet. Just trust me, if you like spy novels, and you have not read this one, do yourself a favor and pick it up today. You will not be disappointed.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|It's full of ads, even though it's a paid app. Removed from device promptly. Please refund the purchase. Absolute garbage.
0451209338|4.0|First of all, let me confess: I love thrillers and I love spy novels. Anything to do with clandestine operations/operatives/assassins, etc. I simply can not get enough of these sorts of stories. Having said that, this one is better than average. Okay, it's WAY better than the average thriller. As I'm sure other reviewers have noted, once it has you hooked you can't put it down.<br /><br />So why should you purchase this novel? First of all the narrative is quick and easy to follow. If you are looking for a slow moving novel this is not for you. It's so quick, as a matter of fact, that I finished it in a day and was left wanting more.<br /><br />Secondly, the main character, Gabriel Allon, is simply one of the most interesting characters ever. Not only is he an Israeli assassin, he is a restorer of fine art. As for this book, the first in the series, we meet up with Allon in England, having quit the Mossad and devoted himself to his other profession, art restoration. Of course, one does not simply quit the Mossad, and before long Allon's past has come back to haunt him. This is all I will say as I'd hate to give away the plot.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a good thriller, pick this book up. I didn't give it 5 stars, as it's good, but not great. Some might see it as literary popcorn, and I'd not disagree. Having said that, popcorn is quite enjoyable, and so is The Kill Artist.

0743297334|4.0|My first experience with Hemingway and it was not particularly an easy one.  First, the writing style was harsh and crass especially for someone like me, who's particularly fond of Victorian literature.  Second, it's hard to accept the characters' many undesirable traits.  What went so wrong in each character's life to make them wind up that way?  It was effective in expressing Hemingway's intention but there was too much description of the activities which I normally consider subject matters of interest to men, particularly fishing and bullfighting.  The story was interesting enough however that I flew through the book to find out, what next?  At the end, there was a feeling that things would never improve and that they would all probably die too young and in some tragic circumstance with a variety of venereal diseases or in need of liver transplants from excessive alcohol consumption.<br /><br />The Spain portion of it was interesting and whet my appetite for travel to that country and reminded me about the excitement of travel in Europe in general.  In spite of the negative feelings, I intend to read his other major works.

1455508977|4.0|The lucky one was a great love story with a great story line and the characters are all well developed. Sparks made them complex, he gave them history, memories, backgrounds and thoughts. It is told in first person by logan, Beth and keith The chapters are told by different people. the book is about logan who survives the marines and  is following his destiny to find his true love and good luck charm. This book has such a rich and inviting writing style that kept me wanting more. The character elizabeth shows some of the real life struggles being a woman with an ex-husband who threatens her and being a single mom. It also shows the struggle of being divorced. This book also shows the power of fate and it shows the chemistry that logan and beth have together. They were atached together like magnets.<br />I also loved the structure of the novel, that we got to know Logan and the meaning behind some of his actions and decisions chapter by chapter through flashbacks as he remembered his tours in Iraq and his time with his mates and Victor. Sparks had a vivid description of southern life I could feel the heat, the humidity and completely picture the setting. The lucky one is now one of my favorite books that i have read and is truley an attention grabber.I would suggest this book to teenage girls who want a good romance book.

B009PLO2RW|5.0|'Haute Cuisine', or 'Les Saveurs du Palais', is the charming and heartwarming story of the personal chef, here named Madame Hortense Laborie (Catherine Frot), of the President of France, Francois Mitterand (Jean d'Ormesson).  Beginning while she is presently cooking on an island off Antarctica although mainly concentrating on her time while spent in Paris, France, in the late 1980's.  Hortense is the perfect blend of a woman's ambition, talent, and grace as the movie bounces back and forth between the two very different places and positions.<br /><br />From the Perigord region of France, this movie moves swiftly with Hortense being whisked away in a very secretive fashion;  not knowing exactly of her destination.  She was only telephoned the previous day by the Ministry of Culture which vaguely explained that they were looking for a woman to cook for an important Senior Official.  Finally meeting up with her contact person, she is unknowingly taken to n33 which is The Palace Elysee in Paris.  Hortense is to be the Official Cook to Le President, to handle all of his meetings with personal friends and his staff.<br /><br />She doubts from the very start that she is the right person for such a position as she has learned to cook simply, homespun and regional dishes from her mother and 'Granny'.  Lovely homemade recipes, named after her family (especially Granny), using the ingredients from her own garden is the family style repertoire brought along with her.  Hortense is reassured \\"that's precisely what the President wants\\".  Now she must relocate to the palace residence leaving behind her beloved farm, livestock and way of life.  The rules for having this new position in the Rue de l'Elysee are, at first, rigid and need to be strictly adhered to; direction, decorum, etiquette and standing.<br /><br />The head chef, sous chef, and other staff from the Main Kitchen refuse to acknowledge her upon introduction, or to work harmoniously along with her.  She is a lone woman within a sea of uppity, stuffy, and pretentious men in white coats.  The pastry chef, Nicolas (Arthur Dupont), receives an instant promotion becoming her \\"second\\" and works like clockwork alongside her in the private Personal Kitchen.  He is an amiable and sweet young man, an opposite of all the other chefs, who then eagerly acclimates Hortense to her new culinary surroundings along with the devices she hasn't seen or used before.  While her new found title carries the weight of the world, she must perform precisely, detailed and exactly.  Without a moment's loss in following the order, she finds herself extremely important and endeared by the President; swiftly garnishing his favor while sharing a mutually friendly ideology of cooking and home-cooked recipes which spark his memories.  Talking openly about \\"recipe books\\" and their childhoods, the two enjoy each other while diplomats wait expectantly at the President's closed door.<br /><br />The entire film is a visual feast with its photography (Laurent Dailland), the vibrant and colorful food leaps right off of the screen. The swollen landscapes are vivid and completely lovely while combing the countries, experiencing The Palace of Paris, and examining plentiful dinner tables. Along with the 'heavily inspired' screenplay, adapted from the book by Daniele Mazet-Delpeuch herself (Hortense Laborie in the film), director Christian Vincent adds a beautifully orchestrated soundtrack (Gabriel Yared).  To the tune of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", and her recollections of finding the perfect truffles, you will fall in love with Hortense and her endearing story ... Bon Appetit!within a sea of uppity, stuffy, and pretentious men in white coats.

B00EW9GQR6|1.0|As a huge Gaga fan I was really waiting for this album, unfortunately I have to admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Her singing voice is is harsh and throaty, she is oversinging and the lyrics are inane. Artpop is boring, predictable and unoriginal yes but most of all it's empty. It's empty as the state of music today. There's no fresh ideas anymore.. anybody is seen as this big artist because they have millions of views on Youtube or millions of followers on Twitter; artists have lost creativity and they're relying on past ideas way too much. In Gaga's case it's the 80's and 90's that are stuck in her head or the people who write for her anyways.<br /><br />EDM is indeed used to fill a song; instead of creating something fresh and new these producers are so uninspiring and boring with the same electro beats over and over again.<br /><br />If Gaga wanted to bring art in pop she could have at least used some real instruments and create something special and truly unique with it.. She chose to fill her mouth with this art thing so that she could impress her gullible fans but in the end she failed to deliver anything worth listening to and to be called art. If someone who's been in the business for not even 5 years is already in need of regurgitating their own previous efforts i'm wondering how creative and artistic they really are after all.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|G.R.R. Martin's fantasy writing isn't limited to the realm of imagination, but is a masterful piece about human characters and their emotions.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you spent the 1980's as a geeky teenager like me, playing video games, dungeons and dragons, and reading scifi, then you'll most likely enjoy this novel as immensely as I did.

The shock of recognition and remembrance I experienced while reading this book was profound and deeply enjoyable. An astoundingly wonderful novel.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|I just saw the film in the theater this past weekend. Gravity is not just a film but an achievement and a landmark for hard science-fiction.  Alfonso Cuarón does not talk down to his audience the way some directors painfully do.  This means that the more that you understand about the physics of space and the technology behind the Space Shuttle, the Soyuz, and the ISS, the more you will appreciate this film.  As many noted scientists and former astronauts have pointed out, Cuarón does fudge the physics a bit in a few places but the average viewer will not have a clue (tears in microgravity, for instance).  In all cases it is to the benefit of the film and the narrative.  There will definitely be some Oscar nods for this one.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Allegiant was, as all of Veronica Roth's books are, very we'll written. In the first two books, there was definitely a lot more action but this book had a quite complex plot. The ending is so surprising and I can't believe what I just read! A good read!

B002B79BVO|3.0|After enjoying the time capsule spectacle of Mad Men Season 1, I decided to give season 2 a try. Well, it begins with two episodes that are barely coherent. I guess this is what passes for &#34;intrigue.&#34; At any rate, many things are simply dropped on the viewer, leaving one to &#34;figure it out.&#34; Further into the season, things became more clear, but there was no reason to confuse or obfuscate so many major plot points, such as what happened to someone's newborn baby. There is still plenty of innuendo, drinking, and smoking, to the point of distraction. While researching the show, I learned the actors are not permitted to smoke tobacco cigarettes on set, so they use herbal ones. This explains why the cigarettes don't seem to burn correctly, which becomes a distraction only because there is so much smoking. Then there is the incessant misogyny, racism, and browbeating. While this may be appropriate for the time, many characters, especially Don Draper (the lead) have practically NO redeeming qualities. With Draper it got to the point where I didn't care about his messed up childhood or his inability to relate to his wife or anyone else. He became a cardboard place holder that needed to do something other than say, &#34;What do you want me to say?&#34; Lame and annoying. Peggy, Roger, and Joan are the characters with more arc and interesting development. Finally, the show hit it's stride near the end, albeit with a few clunky interruptions. I'm left wondering if this whole season needed a re-write. I'm also left wondering if I should go further into this show, or cut my losses. I don't know.
B00CDTSQZW|2.0|Picture Quality = Really good.  4/5<br />Audio Quality = Decent.  3.5/5<br /><br />The real problem here comes with the overall pace of the show.  The acting is fine.  The brutality of the Vikings is accurate.  However, the real issue is that it becomes boring and uninteresting.  A show about vikings shouldn't be boring.<br /><br />Another reviewer called this one of the best shows on tv - I have to disagree.  For my money, give me Sons of Anarchy, Game of Thrones, Banshee, or Justified.<br /><br />Just not worth the pricing.  I wouldn't pay more than $12 to check this out.
B004XIZK5K|5.0|I think this a great book, I have started to do a kettlebell workout to help rehabilitate my shoulder. I hadn't ever heard of them, then one day at the gym I saw them and had to do some research. Read a couple articles and BAM! my torn rotator cuff that had developed a lot of scar tissue and had very poor mobility is now back at full range of motion. I am not doing the whole crossfit stuff, I used to be very fit before a series of injuries about five years ago. And I feel that kettle bells are really doing a lot to get me back to where I need to be. Just go slow and steady. Kettle bells are a different kind of work out. I LOVE KETTLE BELLS. Also, check used sporting goods stores for kettle bells - its not like they wear out or anything.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|All I can say, is be prepared to fall in love with this book. And also don't read it in a public place where it wouldn't be acceptable to cry.
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|This game is great. I was hoping for better graphics like on Xbox and Play Station, but still. This game has all the updated rosters and real player stats. There is a multiseason mode  where you do season The best part that you can make a trade and it will never get rejected. So make your very own dream team. There is even a LeBron James mode where you go through a season or complete challenges. Pleas get this app.
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|Pretty decent album, not their best for sure, but that's ok. Cool packaging if you're actually buying it in CD form.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I can keep in touch with family and friends, that live to far away. I originally got it to keep in touch with my son miles away but now keep in touch with relatives I can't see. I love photos and videos of my grandchildren... some of which I have never been able to meet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that everyone should play this game because there are new power ups lots of abilities its lots of fun.<br /><br />THIS GAME IS AWSOME!!!!!
B00BL5EQLC|3.0|Just not my type of game and it never down loaded to my device. I tried it on someone Else's device but I wasn't impressed for me.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I heard that this game is just like grand theft auto but in there own way I wish that it was for free for kindle fire
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and for any age!  I am 28 years old and love it!  It is fun to compete with fellow Facebook friends too. I have a Kindle Fire and had no problem downloading this app.  If you ever run out of storage,you can delete apps and they will be stored on your cloud device for future usage.  That was just an FYI.  Anyways,this is a neat game and I would recommend it!
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Pushes the limits of what we know to be - as usual with Mr. Rollins.  Very entertaining and not easy to put down.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|Quite a fun game! Graphics are ok, the sounds are predictable, yet not annoying. I like the different brain teasers in the game, figuring out the varying strengths and weaknesses of each kind of turret vs the &#34;greeps&#34;. Decent strategy game. I got it for free, but I think I would have paid a couple of dollars for it, it is that fun :)
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|I have been a fan of these guys since the middle 80's when the \\"Yellow and Black Attack\\" EP was released on cassette.  I have loved all of their music through each and every album they released through the years.  One of my favorites was \\"Against The Law\\" which the band admit was a low point in their careers and rarely perform any of it in concert these days.  That album had so much power and energy which I have hoped they would again tap into.  Well, finally the wait is over!  Although I love the albums they've released the past 10 years or so since they reunited, they didn't have that something that I loved about \\"Against the Law\\".  \\"No More Hell To Pay\\" is the album that finally brought back all that I love about classic Stryper.  Michael Sweet's high vocals and screams are absolutely intact and never sounded better even after all these years.  It seems that taking care of his vocal chords and not abusing them has really paid off.  The dual guitar solos that he and Oz Fox perform throughout never sounded better and are so innovative even after it seems that everything's been done already, they pull out something from left field!  Robert's drums sound like cannons and really show off his awesome skills.  Tim Gaines really shines on this album and is highlighted several times which I loved.  The message in the lyrics are very straight forward and simple but not in your face.  Michael's songwriting is just loaded with catchy songs that I found I could not get out of my head. The deluxe edition is really high quality content and packaging giving us more than our money's worth here.  If you thought that Stryper's best days were behind them, you have got to get this album as it is the best thing they have ever put out no doubt about it. You must buy this!!!!!!
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|Not the best control system, cars are very hard to control, whether it be by tilt or by buttons. Cool graphics, but gameplay is either impossible, or has such a steep learning curve that it isn't worth it for someone looking for a quickie style game.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Unlike traditional 'rollicking' holiday albums, Lennox's Christmas Cornucopia gives some nice old-world songs a new flavor without just rehashing the same top-10 carols you'll hear in every department store. I love this eclectic mix (the video for 'God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen' is worth tracking down online if you haven't seen it). Audio purists have bashed the album's sound quality - I listen to a lot of music and have no problems with the audio. Others have complained about Lennox's voice on this one - it's worth considering that most of these songs are not ones she wrote herself (i.e. these were not tailored by her, for her voice exactly). I have found this album thoroughly delightful - of all my holiday collections, this one gets the most air time.

B009E3EXMU|5.0|Nice package. Awesome performance from the best band ever!! They are amazing in all songs!! Page is out of this world.
B00AE1P8UM|2.0|This was an okay book.  I probably would not recommend it.  I found myself skim reading it.  He is also very repetitive.  He also references the bible a lot (which is not my thing).  So, if you're looking for that sort of clarification this book might be for you.
B00C5WR6JE|5.0|You can never be sure what your going to get from one Frisell release to the next. This time out he's back in the Americana vein, and if you like his other Americana releases in the past, you're bound to enjoy this one as well. There isn't much emphasis on individual solos like you can hear on some of his more jazz inspired releases, but rather the band moving from one place to another as a unit. It's beautiful and compelling music, as good as anything Frisell has ever done.
B00DWV3NM6|5.0|I recently purchased a 27&#34; WQHD monitor which immediately brought my GTX 560 ti to it's knees when running decent quality at 1440p. My original plan was to upgrade to a GTX 770 and stay right around the $300 range as I always have. But slowly I was coaxed into going for the GTX 780 after Nvidia's recent price drop and reading a bunch of reviews. There is a drastic difference in performance between the 770 and 780. I started shopping for 780's and came across Asus' newest version. The fact that it ran cooler and quieter than all other versions had me sold almost immediately.<br /><br />The build quality is superb with this card. It makes my old MSI 560ti Twin Frozr seem super flimsy in comparison. It is quite large and quite heavy but fit in my case just fine. It is near silent at idle. It's a good pair with my Noctua nh-d14 cpu cooler. Even at full load, the gpu fans are still very quiet. Easily 9-10 dbA quieter at full load than my old 560 ti.<br /><br />The performance with this card is outstanding. I've thrown everything I can at it running highest settings on 1440p and it handles everything without a problem. I'm running a Conroe i5 2500K cpu and was concerned I would be limited by the cpu as I've been in the past but this is not the case at all. I feel perfectly fine holding onto my i5 now until Intel's next gen cpus.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|Good read.  Twists, friends, bravery, love.  Loved the plot.  Not a fan of the ending. But glad I read it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It's really good except sometimes it will just cut off in the middle of a chapter. Maybe that has been fixed as I'm not sure if its happened lately
B002LC8HF0|5.0|I read the first two books of the series, enjoyed them a lot, then read the Hero of the Ages and was simply blown away. It is better than both the Final Empire and the Well of Ascension (both of which were excellent books), and lots of unexplained things in the first two books just melt so neatly and beautifully into place. Great character development too, including some characters from the first two books that get fleshed out much more and become truly real.<br /><br />There's just enough in the notes preceding each chapter that the astute reader can guess some of what's to come and to whet the appetite, but not so much that it \\"Ruin\\"ed the (for me!) unexpected ending. Brilliantly struck balance.<br /><br />And the plot itself! The plot! All I can say is wow. A cut above most fantasy fiction plots I've read in the past few years, and right up there (and sometimes exceeding) my other personal favourite, Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus series. I stayed up until 4 am reading to finish this book, the first time I've done that for a book in years.
B0026OR2PE|4.0|In-novation, new from within, I like this innovation perspective and the first half of the book is great. In the last chapters it becomes more of a Guide with ideas on how to start something. I think they are very useful especially if the reader has not been an entrepreneur ever.<br />Great read for the weekend.

B00EY8BRGU|2.0|This movie was quite possibly the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Anyone with a room temperature IQ could figure out the \\"twist\\" within the first 20 minutes. The only trick was how it got me to sit around until the idiotic ending.
B00006FMAW|3.0|Society, a 1992 horror film actually completed in 1989, is a good example of a film that a relatively good and original idea but a delivery that unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Personally, I didn't hate this film, it actually has some genuinely creepy scenes and themes, but I feel that it was played a bit too campy, and because of this it suffered from this fate, which befell many other 1980's B-Movie horror films. That's not to say that it was all bad, as the film successfully combines social satire, mystery, and body horror all into one interesting, and dare I say it, thought provoking film. If you can look past the sub-par acting, stilted dialogue, and rather idiotic protagonist, there are actually a lot of truthful statements about class and high \\"society\\", and how the rich tend to feed on the poor. Well this film is essentially that statement personified. It follows a wealthy, all-american teen who was born and raised in a splendid mansion in Beverly Hills and has a seemingly good family who genuinely love and care for each other, however, at the same time, something is clearly wrong, as Billy feels as though he is different than the other members of his family, as they don't look much like him (they all have blonde and red hair and he has dark), and seem to be hiding something from him.<br /><br />The first scene in the film focuses on Billy wandering around his house in the dark of night hearing whispering voices and strange movements in the seemingly empty halls and rooms, and it only gets weirder from there. Through out the whole film there's a sense of mystery and deception as Billy, along with his friend Milo, seek to uncover the truth behind \\"Society\\". The real terror begins when Billy's sister's weird obsessed ex-boyfriend Blanchard shows him a recording of something odd and frightening that transpired during her \\"coming out party\\". Suffice to say it's the complete opposite of what you would expect from the polite and dignified members of the aristocracy, so to speak. I don't know where Yuzna got his idea for this film, but I suspect it has something to do with the fact that throughout history, many members of so-called \\"society\\" have turned out to be cruel, monstrous human beings who engaged in much of what goes on behind closed doors in this film. Individuals like Elizabeth Bathory, the blood countess of Hungary, Gilles de Rais, notorious serial killer and member of Breton nobility, and the infamous ruler of Transylvania who inspired the fiendish Dracula himself, Vlad Dracul, or Vlad the Impaler.<br /><br />It really gets you thinking. Anyway, the film itself is quite disturbing and genuinely gross and revolting at times, especially in a certain scene towards the end when the truth is finally unraveled. I gotta say, I was not expecting the big reveal that this film provided, it definitely caught me off guard, and for that, I can't help but admire Brian Yuzna and this film, even if he went a bit overboard on the gross-out scenes. Truth be told, I'm not a huge fan of Body Horror to begin with, so maybe it's because of that. Anyway, if you enjoyed films like Jacob's Ladder, Eraserhead, From Beyond, Tetsuo the Iron Man, and Parents, a similar film also completed (and released) in 1989, you should definitely check out this underrated horror classic.ristocracy, so to speak.

B00E5I2MDQ|5.0|I loved this movie! Chris Hemsworth is incredibly sexy and makes this movie enjoyable for both men and women. Don't get me wrong though. There's more to the movie than just a good looking man. The storyline was excellent and I can't wait to see the sequel.

0451457994|4.0|Getting past the movie hype, this was a master hypothesizing as to what we would do with artifacts left in space. An ideal subject for a 'bull-session', you could examine the intentions of whoever created the artifacts. Would they install beacons, maps or Easter Eggs? -by that, you could argue that knowledge of space travel is dangerous, powerful, useful or best integrated a little at a time. Certainly, by reaching the second monolith, Dave achieves an existence to be envied by Earth-bound philosophers.<br />Or will artifacts be machines for their owners' use, as in [[ASIN:161614369X City of Ruins]]?<br />Perhaps the introduction, by Gordon Baxter, is effusive, but the story has achieved cult status.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Another game that receives a lot of hype & TV commercials; doesn't do anything different than other match 3 games; and charges real money for lives you need (you only get 5 free and I haven't found a way to gain lives free). The lives aren't cheap either.<br />So not a free game in reality and expensive to play --- and alternatives to the match 3 is availalbe. Try Bulblitz or Playrix games nstead.  Give this one a skip it.
B00BEIYMZ6|4.0|With a big nod to National Lampoon's and the Hangover franchise, We're The Millers is a surprisingly funny flick that's constantly aware of its own flimsiness but keeps just having a good time along the way. This is one of those concepts that writes itself and once you know the set up, you can predict 95% of the rest of the film as it unfolds, though the near-constant gags keep it going. Jason Sudeikis is funny as always but the entire family cast works well as the dysfunctional group ripping off Mexican drug lords while swinging in a camp site with a DEA agent. The whole script must have read like this by the way - it's a bunch of short phrases brainstormed at Happy Hour such as \\"weed baby\\" and \\"kissing lessons from Jennifer Aniston\\". While it runs out of steam in the last 20 minutes or so, most of the audience should be happy that at least something mildly amusing came out of Hollywood in 2013.  By the time it hits $3.99 on Amazon Prime, this is a reasonably solid night in for some adult-friendly humor.

B003L77G6A|3.0|The Chuck Lorre sitcom `The Big Bang Theory' started off as an average sitcom. It was nothing to write home about, but it was worth seeing on a rainy Saturday. In seasons two and three, the writing became sharper and the characters became less based on dated stereotypes. Season four sees the show at occasionally the heights it reached in seasons two and three, yet it also includes some of the weakest, laziest episodes the show has ever produced.<br /><br />As stated before, the quality of season four is highly inconsistent and unpredictable. We start off with two merely solid episodes with excellent sub-plots that aren't really able to bring the episode up to \\"great comedy\\" status: \\"The Robotic Manipulation\\" contains some brilliant dialogue in Amy and Sheldon's first date, but Howard's sub-plot about a robot hand stuck on a certain part of his body drags the episode down. \\"The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification\\" features a likable Sheldon in a sub-plot full of laughs, but a surplus of fart jokes are unnecessary and frankly unfunny. This is the main problem with season four: the humor has become a little dumbed down. Out of all four seasons, this one is the weakest yet, and the fact that it also has the most fart jokes and poop jokes of all four seasons so far isn't much of a coincidence.<br /><br />The actual writing also seemed a little lazy halfway through the season. There are certain episodes where one could almost know that the writers had run out of ideas. Take \\"The Alien Parasite Hypothesis,\\" in which an entire sub-plot revolves around Howard and Raj trying to prove who would be the better sidekick to a hypothetical hero. I'd presume that about 10 minutes are spent on that narrative, with barely any smart comedy to find in it. Since there are more relationships this season, serialization would've been nice too (as it is for most shows). The writers tried it in two season three episodes, and it worked quite well.<br /><br />Some of the best episodes have solid humor and situational writing. Unfortunately though, a good nine or ten of the 24 episodes are lazily written or have too much bathroom humor to be excellent episodes. If you want smart humor, you should probably get season two or three. If you want a season full of mostly merely solid episodes with the occasional mediocre episode and the occasional great episode, this one's for you.<br /><br />Best episodes: \\"The 21-Second Excitation\\" and \\"The Roommate Transmogrification\\"<br /><br />Season grade: B

For this and a Sandisk Micro SDHC Class 10 i paided $30-$35 bucks. $30-$40 difference.
0143124544|4.0|Once I started this book and got past page 70, I couldn't put it down. Normally, this book wouldn't be my cup of tea.  I usually steer clear of books that deal with heavy medical stuff, but this was a compelling, humorous, bittersweet read that left me thinking deeply.  Loved all the characters.  The epilogue had me sobbing. I don't want to say too much, and have any spoilers in here.  This is a great read that will make you reflect on motherhood, sisterhood, love, and the importance of living each day to the fullest.
B005SAP45I|4.0|Entertaining is what I say<br />So go ahead and rent it and little will you pay<br />Not good enough to buy<br />And so with truth I tell you this, I don't lie<br /><br />So I heard a lot of things against this one, but I actually liked it.  However, I'm not so sure it's so good for small kids as cars actually die and get tortured...was kind of surprised.  However, for adults it's entertaining, just go in with low expectations and you'll like it.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Great read with a really strong finish. The characters were believable and the plot was interesting and easy to follow.
B000FC10QG|3.0|So I know this is a business classic and it is a interesting read but boy is it long at time.  The book really goes into great detail at times about what is happening during all these different meetings but what it lacks is a clear followup to how things really ended with RJR/Nabisco.<br /><br />It needs to talk about how Louis Grestner couldn't turn the company around, how the business failed, how KKR paid too much.  One short end chapter is not enough.

B00EVW0VTI|1.0|[[ASIN:B00EVW0VTI White House Down]]<br />I gave this review one * only because I had to put in something in order to write the review, other than that it would have gotten ZIP nothing. I sat through watching Olympus has fallen only because it was free. I watched the trailer on this movie, and I don't think I'd watch it even if it was free.<br /><br />I think we have come to a point in this nation where there needs to be a law against degrading our military, Secret Service, the presidency and any other organization that is structured for the security and the defense of this nation done in the name of action and adventure movies of any kind. I believe this falls under the heading of Homeland Security.<br /><br />We know that there are many rogue nations, terrorist and other idiots who would be enticed to really think that this nation is so poorly defended and thinks so little of itself that it shows us as being so stupid in the name of humor over a few bucks for the writers. And don't blame them if they feel like we're worth taking a shot at given what they see in our movies.<br /><br />This is a shame and a disgrace to see all that we hold dear misused, and serious actors made to look like bungling jokes that know the truth but will do anything for a few bucks more, even damaged their reputation and integrity.<br /><br />Wake up America, this could be another prep for another 9/11,  loose change.

B0010SKUYM|4.0|Blend of expected basics and surprises that make this a fun tale. Worth one's time so that you will not be disappointed.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Just … just … This was not just another book. The subject of the book hit so close to home it was unreal. This author portrayed the whole fan fiction bit so well. Cather was me, well, except I'm forty and have a family and not eighteen going away to college.<br /><br />But this story is not just about fan fiction. It has some tough issues and a great, slow-building romance, too. The best thing a book can do is pull the reader into the story, fully and completely. Like wrap you up in it and make you love it, care about, and feel like you can't live without it. This story did that for me. I loved Cather and Wren and Reagan and Levi. Such a great cast of characters and with all of their imperfections and quirks, I still loved them. I also understood and related with each of them and that connected me even more to them.<br /><br />The words were beautiful and the themes made an impact. However, I truly did not find myself enjoying the fan fiction portions. And really, it's a good thing, because I loved the story so much I didn't want the interruptions with a side story that meant nothing to me. I understood the reason for it and it was a cute idea, but it just didn't work for me. It was a little irritating at time because I listened to this book and couldn't skim these portions, so I had to listen to the Simon Snow snippets. That would be my only complaint and it's not even that bad.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|As a fan of Shakespeare, I really enjoyed this movie.  In my opinion, this is one of the best adaptations of any Shakespeare play.  The actors fully embrace the language, and maintain a pacing that resembles a good TV sitcom, which is unusual for Shakespeare.  The pacing and the clear language, coupled with the stylistic elements of setting it all in one house and filming in black and white truly set this film apart.  The performances are all excellent and the story is funny. Great film.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|I really liked this book very much. It was very much like Anna and the French Kiss in the manner that one of them had a significant other and they did not get together until the end. I liked Lola, I did, but she was no Anna. However, Cricket was amazing and sweet and patient and just honest. I loved his honesty. I love how in this book the characters did not play around their words, they said what they meant and didn't string the other along with words. With actions, yeah, maybe, but words, no. I'm sort of over the old, &#34;she should have told him … whatever it was&#34; Instead of saying, &#34;Nothing.&#34; when asked what's wrong. I like when people speak their minds. I do and I guess I expect everyone to, so that's why in books when the characters don't it leaves me confused and aggravated. Don't get me wrong, I know everyone is different and not everyone speaks there mind, it's just that it's happened so much in books and using that as a trope to prolong the two characters getting together.<br />Okay, enough about that. Lola learned so much in this book, and I love how Perkins sneaks in these little lessons so subtly that one really has to pay attention. I love that the characters grow, even the ones that seem as if they don't need to. I'm saying &#34;loved&#34; a lot, but I can't help it. I loved the whole soulmate thing, and that when you find yours it's easy. Perhaps getting there is a bit difficult, but once there, it's as easy as breathing. I believe that to be very true. Something worth having is worth the fight to get there. But once you have it, it should be seamless and comfortable.<br /><br />This was a great story and continuation of Anna and the French Kiss. We got to see Anna and Etienne. Yay! I can't wait until the next book so we can get more of Cricket and Lola (or at least I hope we'll get to see them).

1451695195|5.0|This was the most amazing book I have read. It takes someone like a doctor that others will<br />listen to before they believe.  I had an experience before I went into surgery<br />where I was in church the day before my surgery and I felt the most  wonderful calming feeling<br />wash over me.  I was so relaxed the night before my surgery that my sister said it &#34;seemed like<br />I was going to Disney instead of surgery&#34;.  In surgery there was a mishap and I almost died.<br />After a week in intensive care, a priest came in to talk to me and when I told him what had<br />happened, he said it was God preparing  me to handle to worst that could happen, and have<br />my body ready.  I believe wholeheartedly that there is Proof of Heaven.

B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Approachable and inviting, this adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy does the unthinkable--it manages to keep the language without seeming stilted in a more modern setting. Part of what makes Shakespeare difficult is that to perform it you must have a keen understanding of it, and many actors struggle to really inhabit the meaning rather than simply recite the lines. To inhabit while mastering a complicated comedic timing and beat-for-beat sparring match with the other actors? I have nothing but respect for anyone able to play Beatrice and Benedick well.<br /><br />On that note, Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof have phenomenal chemistry. The black and white lends the film a noir-ish feel that matches the cagey humor, and Nathan Fillion and Tom Lenk are crazy-cool as the cops that get it right by accident. The girl who plays Hero has a beautiful dignity that made me want to cry during the (first) wedding scene. Amy Acker's performance of the &#34;If I were a man&#34; speech is heart-rending, and for a play supposedly about nothing, the combined weight of a woman's honor and a man's pride have a very real presence throughout. Visually interesting, full of unforced humor, and grounded in a deeply felt love story, Much Ado about Nothing is worth every bit of its 'ado'.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great puzzle game.  I like the format.  Having the option to keep puzzle pieces off the board while solving is wonderful!
1452123071|5.0|I have both Darth Vader and Son & Vader's Little Princess books and they are such a delight! I love Jeffrey Brown's style, humor and his ability to show Darth Vader's soft side. Anyway, since I didn't want to tear some of the pages from the actual book, the postcards are a great alternative to frame and display. It's also fun to send to people whether they have kids or not, especially if they like the original Star Wars Trilogy. And by the way, I met Mr. Brown at 2013 SDCC, and he's such a super nice guy! Not only he signed my books, but also drew on them!

B00CEF014E|4.0|This is a proper suspense thriller that revolves around Dana whose boyfriend Tyler seems to go missing while on their way to meet their families. She unites with her sister who has married the head of a community that lives by certain strange rules. The discovery of a dead body near the community's premises throws open a pandora's box of possibilities, including danger to Dana's own life. I particularly liked the choice of words to describe the scenes and actions . Very realistic and enticing . The only thing I probably didn't like was some jumps in sequences and a slightly anti-climactic ending. But overall, good read.

B00EK0UBPU|5.0|This book appealed to me for three reasons, firstly the intricate and circuitous plot, secondly the attention to detail of the characters and lastly the feeling that as you read you are living in that time of history as an observer. Eleanor Catton brings vividly to life the gold rush days of Hokitika and Otago in a masterful sweep.

B00957T6X6|3.0|I love the Song of Ice and Fire series, but when you combine all five books into one eBook there has to be an easier way to navigate. Each book in this edition is its own chapter, instead of having all the chapters nested under a book title. I would rather have them as five separate eBooks.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|When I was 13 years old, I was standing in Musicland at a mall in Missoula, Montana, when I heard two guys behind me talking about a heavy metal band.  I remember the words, &#34;They're actually not bad for a Christian band.&#34;  That was my introduction to Stryper, and since I first picked up the To Hell with the Devil cassette, the band has ranked as my favorite of all time.  Nearly 30 years later, No More Hell to Pay has arrived, and I have to admit that I was readying myself for disappointment.  Michael Sweet had been hyping the release for months, using phrases such as &#34;our best album&#34; to describe it.  The expectations were so high that I wasn't sure whether the album would live up to them.  I am sure now.  NMHTP is Stryper's finest work since Against the Law, and it re-establishes the band as a major force in the metal genre (Christian or secular).  No longer slaves to the pop-metal genre, Stryper has gone heavier with dual-guitar solos and screams that are just as loud and clear as those on The Yellow and Black Attack.  The strongest tracks on the album are the title track, Legacy, Marching into Battle, Sympathy, and Renewed, but there is no filler here.  Congratulations to Michael, Robert, Oz, and Tim on an album that gets Stryper right back where it belongs - among the world's finest metal bands.

B0024Y7F0S|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. It is even better than the Terminate movies. The series gives Conner and Sarah a whole new depth and personality.
B008JFUS28|5.0|Marvel is re-creating what they did to create The Avengers, right now, with their Infinity Stones sub-plot. It's just introducing a piece at a time as they build up to something bigger. In The Avengers, we got our first view of Thanos and his attempt to take control of the Tesseract, which, in The Dark World, is revealed to be one of the six Infinity Stones, artifacts predating the origins of the universe. And, also on The Dark World, Malekith is after the Aether which is another of these \\"stones\\" although it actually takes on a fluid form.<br /><br />This all sounds like it's leading up to an Infinity Gauntlet kind of scenario, which would be pretty darn cool and pretty darn cosmic. The fact that Guardians of the Galaxy is coming out next year only strengthens the case for all of this. I would expect another of the Infinity Stones to show up in that one.<br /><br />Of course, none of that actually relates to whether Thor: The Dark World is any good in and of itself.<br /><br />Actually, Thor 2 is better than Thor. This one just seemed more \\"Thor\\" than the first one, although I don't have a good reason for feeling that way because there was an awful lot of Thor-ness about the first one, too. Maybe, it was just that this one flowed more smoothly whereas the first one definitely seemed to have its \\"Earth\\" parts and its \\"Asgard\\" parts as separate things. If you're doing Thor as Thor (not Thor trapped in the body of a mortal), he definitely needs to have the full range of being Thor.<br /><br />And there were a lot of cool moves with Mjolnir in this one, things like Thor leaping off of balconies as the hammer came whizzing over the building and into his hand. They definitely did their best to show the connection between Thor and the hammer.<br /><br />The acting was great, even Christopher Eccleston, whom I'm not particularly fond of as an actor (Doctor or not). His range seems to be quite small, but his role as Malekith was a good fit as it didn't require a lot of emotion and even less facial expression. Zachary Levi also did a pretty good job as Fandral, although, as partial as I am to Chuck, I think he didn't quite fill out Josh Dallas' shoes. There was just some ineffable quality about Dallas that made him more Fandral. Portman, also, seemed to wear the role of Jane Foster much more easily in this one, so that was nice.<br /><br />The thing that really made the movie work, though, was the chemistry between Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Even when not onscreen together, they pulled off the roles of warring brothers perfectly. The sibling rivalry was perfect. There's this one moment where Thor is about to hit Loki (hey, it's not really a spoiler, okay (well, kind of, but, well, deal with it)) and Thor pulls away saying, \\"Mother wouldn't want us to fight,\\" and Loki smiles and says, \\"But she wouldn't be shocked.\\" The relationship is perfect.<br /><br />The movie also has a bit more humor in it than the last Thor, and it's not all at the expense of Darcy this time, though she does have her moments. The only real negative I'd say the movie has is that the humor breaks the tension a little too much every so often. But those are only minor bumps on the road and barely memorable once past them. It does pull you right back in.<br /><br />Overall, the movie has an epic feel to it that seems appropriate to a story about gods, and it does it while keeping the movie personal. That all by itself is quite an accomplishment. So, yeah, I think Thor 2 is a step above the first one, something that's not all  that common with a sequel. It doesn't make it up to the level of the first Iron Man or Captain America movies, but it does surpass both of the Iron Man sequels. If you've been following the Marvel movies at all, you certainly don't want to miss this one.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|*Copy of book obtained from NetGalley*<br /><br />Waking up married was a pleasant read however it didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />I found the writing a little confusing occasionally having to re-read paragraphs and the plot very predictable. The emotions didn't leap off the page even though there was plenty of love, lust and heartache involved.<br /><br />The characters are likeable and that's what saved this book. Megan is a strong independent woman who has a career and knows what she wants in her life. She never expected to wake up married nor could she believe that a stranger would want to stay married to her. Connor is a successful businessman who wants his marriage to remain emotion free and more like a partnership. He is of the opinion that emotions complicate things and hurt is the only result. Both these characters have had bad luck with love in the past and it has made them both want to avoid it. Apparently their hearts have a different opinion.<br /><br />Waking Up Married doesn't have any earth shattering drama involved and is a good read for a rainy day. Unfortunately I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected.<br /><br />Review in full: [...]

B00BD99JMW|4.0|In both Divergent and Insurgent there is loss, but none like in Allegiant. In Allegiant bravery is key. Every character must be brave at a point in this book. Remember that when you reach the ending. It'll help. And trust me, have tissues with you. This book is good once you get over the loss. There isn't much more I can say other than read it and you will understand.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|Allegiant, you were the biggest disappointment of the year for me. Here I was looking for an epic battle between the Allegiant and the Erudite but instead, what I got was a complete and utter mess. It's taken me days to form some coherent thoughts on the book so here goes...<br /><br />WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />The problems I had with Allegiant<br /><br />MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE<br /><br />Now I don't have any problems with going out of the box, and Allegiant was a true mind numbing experience. Instead of giving us the epic, final battle we were looking for, Veronica Roth chose to defer from the whole thing and explain the true reasoning behind the factions. This is how it went...<br /><br />The Bureau of Genetic Warfare: You were all an experiment, and your whole life and everything you know is a lie.<br /><br />Tris and co.: ...Oh okay then.<br /><br />Wouldn't you think that if this happened to you and your friends, there would be denial, breakdowns, refusals and drama? These guys were just stunned, accepting mullets.<br /><br />WHAT MAKES YOU SO PERFECT<br /><br />The biggest shock to Tris and Co. appear to be some strange form of prejudice, where the Bureau has manufactured the Chicago experiment to box people away into their neat little pigeon holes so they can modify their behaviour based on their genetically damaged (GD) genes. Yes, these are the factions that we know.<br /><br />The reasoning behind this is to absolve the flawed behaviour of these genetically damaged people after the government has unsuccessfully messed around with people's genes resulting in The Purity War, which I'll talk more about below.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but calling someone genetically damaged does not sit right with me. Everyone has flaws and you learn to live together and love one another. If you thought the prejudice of the factions were bad, imagine the disdain that would come from someone's genetic makeup. I can't ever imagine people giving consent to messing with people's genes on a mass scale.<br /><br />..Every faction loses something when it gains a virtue: the Dauntless, brave but cruel; the Erudite, intelligent but vain, the Amity, peaceful but passive; the Candor, honest but inconsiderate; the Abnegation, selfless but stifling.<br /><br />FLAWED REASONING<br /><br />The Bureau pretty much manufactured the experiments after The Purity War, where those with damaged genes after extensive genetic manipulation had waged a war on the government and those with pure genes. Their primary goal is to ultimately heal people's genes to become the Divergent, recovering from the ultimate fatal flaws of the GD. If this is the case, why did they not equip the Chicago experiment with this knowledge and filter all of the Divergent out of the city, once identified? Why were the Divergent placed under threat from the faction leaders? It makes no sense.<br /><br />LET'S JUST HIT RESET<br /><br />Those Bureau guys just won't learn. It appears that the uprising in Chicago has happened once before in the outer edges of the factionless places. So they administered the memory serum to make everyone forget it ever happened and start over. While it's happening again, and what's their solution? The memory serum again. Just so they can watch their sick reality TV show all over again.<br /><br />Not to mention Tris's plan to wipe the memories of The Bureau, thereby making everything obsolete and pointless. The experiments, the GD war, the serums, everything. Let's stop them from wiping away the memories of our loved ones by wiping away their memories, that will teach them! Last I heard, two wrongs don't make a right.<br /><br />GOODBYE SEXY BROODY FOUR, HELLO MR WHINY<br /><br />When Allegiant was announced, we were excited to get inside the mind of the mysterious Four and find out what goes on in his head. What it turns out to be is a constant whining, insecurity, mommy and daddy issues, and a whole lot of angsty emotion. Four in Divergent/Insurgent, was a hunky, confident, mysterious instructor. Four in Allegiant is an annoying, whingy puddly mess. Not only that, but in Allegiant he seems to make all the wrong decisions and not trust Tris repeatedly, even though she was right. Roth must have had a vendetta against him, making his decisions result in Uriah's death, taking away Tris, making him one of the GD.<br /><br />As the book switched perspectives between Tris and Four, it was difficult to pick out who it was throughout the book. The two just sounded so damn similar and their voice was exactly the same.<br /><br />SIDE CHARACTERS - WHO WERE THEY AGAIN?<br /><br />Christina, Uriah, Caleb, Cara and co. were all in this book but the fact of the matter is - you could have taken them away and come up with exactly the same outcome. The only one that seemed to make any impact was Nita, the new rebel girl who has her own illogical ideas. But the whole flirting with disaster thing with Four? Didn't sit well with me. And Caleb of course, who was a sniveling mess of a man living in the shadow of what he did to Tris in the past. There's a man who for his whole early life, urged Tris to be selfless. There's a man who couldn't be selfless himself, when it came down to it.<br /><br />HERE'S AN IDEA - LET'S COMMUNICATE!<br /><br />At the end of the book, there's 4 different plans that went on to stop the overthrowing of the Chicago experiment, that would result in the death of thousands and dare I say - the genetically pure/Divergent. The Bureau would release a mass memory serum and wipe out the memories of the entire city. One group will go in to inoculate their loved ones from the mass memory wipe. The other group will go in, take the death serum and release the memory serum on The Bureau. And Four decides to go against all of this and administer the memory serum to either Evelyn or Marcus to end this thing once and for all. At any one point, they could have told each other what was going on. But nope, never happened. Which is frustrating, seeing as Four's plan could have saved them all.<br /><br />FINALLY...THE DEATH WAS ONLY FOR SYMBOLISM'S SAKE<br /><br />I'm not so cut that Tris died in the first place, after all that is who Tris is, brave and selfless and always putting her loved ones ahead of herself, even if it was for snivelling Caleb who deserves death himself. Tris, in this novel could do no wrong. She was always right, she was selfless, she was genetically pure, she loved and finally sacrificed herself for the good of everyone. That's great, because we love Tris and her journey over the past 3 books have showed her that she's her own person.<br /><br />But my biggest problem was how the author administered the final blow, and then the way she justified it to everyone in her explanatory blog post. Let's have Tris survive a death serum (how is that even possible), have a false sense of survival and then have someone come in a shoot her! That is just cruel. Tris has survived death so many times and she went in because she knew she had a sliver of a chance in surviving. Roth considered having her survive, but didn't, just because she deserved it and that was what she chose:<br /><br />This was the end she had chosen, and I felt she had earned an ending that was as powerful as she was. - Roth<br /><br />Symbolism's sake, the ending could have just been powerful in the wake of Tris surviving, but instead it is causing an Erudite/Factionless outrage.<br /><br />OVERALL THOUGHTS<br /><br />I found Allegiant to be disappointing for a myriad of reasons, it was illogical, rendered a book boyfriend completely useless and ripped away what could have been a satisfying ending to an awesome trilogy into something that completely ruined my affinity for the whole series. Veronica Roth took risks, she's Dauntless and gave us something that we couldn't have imagined and that, I do respect. Unfortunately, the end result turned out to be an incoherent mess filled with illogical sequences and a crappy ending.<br /><br />Now does anyone know where I can get myself some memory serum?<br /><br />I received a review copy from Harper Collins Australia in exchange for an honest review.

That's great, because we love Tris and her journey over the past 3 books have showed her that she's her own person.<br /><br />But my biggest problem was how the author administered the final blow, and then the way she justified it to everyone in her explanatory blog post. Let's have Tris survive a death serum (how is that even possible), have a false sense of survival and then have someone come in a shoot her! That is just cruel. Tris has survived death so many times and she went in because she knew she had a sliver of a chance in surviving. Roth considered having her survive, but didn't, just because she deserved it and that was what she chose:<br /><br />This was the end she had chosen, and I felt she had earned an ending that was as powerful as she was. - Roth<br /><br />Symbolism's sake, the ending could have just been powerful in the wake of Tris surviving, but instead it is causing an Erudite/Factionless outrage.<br /><br />OVERALL THOUGHTS<br /><br />I found Allegiant to be disappointing for a myriad of reasons, it was illogical, rendered a book boyfriend completely useless and ripped away what could have been a satisfying ending to an awesome trilogy into something that completely ruined my affinity for the whole series. Veronica Roth took risks, she's Dauntless and gave us something that we couldn't have imagined and that, I do respect. Unfortunately, the end result turned out to be an incoherent mess filled with illogical sequences and a crappy ending.<br /><br />Now does anyone know where I can get myself some memory serum?<br /><br />I received a review copy from Harper Collins Australia in exchange for an honest review.

B005LAII4E|4.0|Very fun film. It wouldn't get my highest rating, but I did thoroughly enjoy it. Recommended if you like this kind of action film.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I have been wating for this my whole life, i was 6 years old when i watched Episode IV, i most likely all of you can relate to that fist time experience with Star Wars... this realy defined the movie experience for ever. Now im 40, and the proud owner of this Blu-Ray release, that i can share with my daugters, and enjoy as many times as i want to. All movies are great in this format, sound is superb, you wont regret this purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Once I start playing the game, I can't stop anymore. Me and my friend spawned the Zombie Pigman and couldn't stop. The dogs are so sweet<br />I recommend this game to the young and the elderly. As a future author, I love to buy books but this app is soooo worth your money.<br />Buy it before it's sold out!

B0015DWJX2|5.0|My favorite book of the last five years.  I did not want it to end.  I also liked that I learned more about how people in Europe got through WWII.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favorite-ist game to hare play. Have it on all my devices and play it almost every damn day! Arrrrrgh!!!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a period of history that is so full of meat. I have read biographies of Adams in the past, and didn't run across any real problems with conflicting stories. It was beautifully done. I thought it would be great to watch it with my grandkids then they just had to tick in that bedroom scene in France. Why??? We know the Adams had children, but don't need to watch them be human.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I was LOVING this game until it &quot;reset&quot; itself. I was on level 25, over half the pictures opened and had just purchased crystals and coins from the bank. now I'm back at level 1, &quot;money&quot; gone, AND can't seem to get any other pictures opened. NOT happy with this game right now!!
B0011NVC9I|5.0|The scenery is worth watching all by itself. Everyone seems to have a different take on the story, but this one is interesting and good. This makes me ant to visit Iceland.
B0098460O4|5.0|His voice is gorgeous, full bodied, warm and strong. Her voice has developed a lovely sophistication. I'm in love with the music
B006PTL1GC|3.0|The acting is superb. The costumes, scenes, and filming are well above average. Perhaps I'm just not sympathetic to the subject matter. It's worth spending the time to watch though.
B000FC2ROU|5.0|Full of vivid images and some twisted ideas, for the creative and weird guys. A book to love no matter what, at least to me...
B0072GPQ72|4.0|The scenery is beautiful. I found myself wishing the story would move along faster, but it's well worth watching. Parts of it were a bit far fetched.
B00846REIS|3.0|The characters are very unrealistic...they're so annoying it was hard to read at times. But better than fifty shades of grey
B005LAIII0|4.0|This is a beautiful film with stunning cinematography. The story has enough twists to keep it interesting. I feel that &#34;truth is truth&#34;, and manufacturing something different to make it easier to live with is unacceptable.
B003EEMIV8|5.0|Bruder makes amazing trucks, my 3 year old has 4 of them.  Very sturdy, very detailed.  Worth every penny spent.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This series is fun. Each movie is well done. The acting, artwork, costumes, everything is worth watching. The musical background is also beautifully done. Sometimes it's fun to move into a world that is wild and crazy, and just forget the present. This is a film you can watch with anyone without embarrassment.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent book! This is the first book I've read by Liane Moriatry and I'm about to look into her other books. You may want to schedule READING this book when you have chunks of hours as it was very hard for me to put down.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Who couldn't love &#34;The Hobbit&#34;? We have waited so long for it come out. I do think Jackson became so enamored with all the techie stuff that he lost the magic of the story. His old horror movie story background came out with too much time spent on things like the gobblin cave and thunder storm. Still, that being said, it's well worth watching.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun  I would rate it a 10  to me it's like the new temple run etc:-)
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I enjoyed all the series. I was a little disappointed in some of the ending, but then that's the way the book went. Harry Potter got so many kids to enjoy reading. The films are all so well done with beautiful artwork and acting. Well worth watching.
B008MM9630|3.0|It asks you to buy things with gems that makes in turn buy more from the app store. The time limits for the quests are reasonable
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Once you select the language you want to learn, each lesson provides several different techniques.  You select pictures, you translate from your language to the other language and back the other way. You to use your device microphone to try out your pronunciation.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was such a good book...sad at times for the innocence of childhood lost, but love that never can be broken. One of my favorite books.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Forget Game of Thrones.  *This* is epic.  I have never been so disappointed to end a book as I did this one.  And that's only because when I read Mistborn, the other 2 books had already been released.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|The Goldfinch is a brilliant story with memorable characters and most of the book is incredibly well done and fun to read.<br /><br />\\"Most\\" being the operative word.<br /><br />Tartt needed an editor to cut out a lot of the repetitive detail (Like several other reviewers, I too found myself page skimming -- sometimes the detail is fascinating, oftentimes it's unnecessary and just slows down the story.)<br /><br />There are a few other nits a good editor could have fixed, e.g. the internet makes cameo appearances but it's inconsistent - characters will make use of it in the way people do in 2013 but then later in the same scene they seem to forget it exists (and there's much more of the latter than the former-- Tartt recently did an interview with the New York Times where she admits to only using the web \\"to look up phone numbers\\" and her unfamiliarity is pretty evident, which is a problem in a novel whose main protagonists are 20somethings), a number of key plot points are telegraphed way in advance in a manner that feels more heavy-handed than than skillful, there are minor-but-critical unexplained plot points (e.g. why Theo's mother never considered leaving his father) whose omission seems curious in a novel that goes into such minute detail about everything else. And then of course there are the adult Theo's relationships with women, all of which seem overly chaste and prim and bloodless (especially compared to his relationship with Boris)-- even when he professes otherwise.<br /><br />There's a lot of Great Expectations in this novel-- I can't imagine it's coincidence that one of the main characters is called Pippa-- and Tartt frequently uses Dickens beloved device of the happy coincidence to move the plot forward. Usually Tartt makes the device work, but there are other times where the plot twists seem plucked from a forgettable TV movie of the week.<br /><br />The final chapter could also have used some heavier editing--\\" philosophizing\\" is a great way to endTheo's story, but the chapter just drags on forever, like a well meaning guest who won't stop saying goodbye.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because it's a really masterful story and the fairy tale quality makes it markedly different from so much of modern fiction. I just wish the editors would have had a heavier hand.
B000JQUKKU|4.0|I liked the book but in some places it uses old English and it's a bit hard to read<br />in those places
B005LAIIN0|2.0|I was sucked into this one by the movie trailers.  I spent $6 on pay-per-view for what I would call a $2 Zombie with $2 worth of special effects WHEN this snoozer isn't concentrating on Brad and his not-well-cast family.  Comcast and whatever studio made this: you owe me $2. I'd rather has watched Shawn of the Dead for the 6th time.<br /><br />I get it - Zombies and zomb moview/tv shows are popular but what gets me is the this rolling 'whatever' of zombies led me to believe I would be watching something sophisticated and not just a \\"me too\\" production like the countless and tiresome 'Vampire' nonsense.  BTW, if you want a good Vamp story, try Anne Rice.<br /><br />The two stars go to the creators of the special effects.
B00EZ50SGW|5.0|I thought the first Insidious movie rocked so when the 2nd one came out I just had to see it right away in the theater and I loved every minute of it!!!!  The story was awesome, the acting was phenomenal, and it scared the living s*** out of me and my wife!!!!  I've been watching horror movies ever since I was 5 years old and I love them a lot and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to be scared because it is that freaking good and extremely creepy and scary as hell!!!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Just skipped to the end after about 150 pages in.<br />It's the writing. It's just too mediocre.<br />Glad so many can overlook this and like the series but I'm just not one of them.
1592401791|5.0|i couldn't stop reading this. this book is for any, yes ANY, inspiring sound engineer, musician or anyone who has a home studio!!!<br /><br />the most romantic book you'll ever read about the sculpting of sound with your curiosity, and making history.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|I really wanted to like this. However, the opening track, with it's back-and-forth meandering through different audio effects turned me off immediately. In fact, it reminded me of a video I saw at a wedding once where the person who put it together used just about every special effect he could find, thus killing the mood altogether. Still, I stuck in there and listened to the entire release from start to finish. Just when I thought a song was going to be good, it fell apart in production. Too much production to be exact and that's the real problem with this album--it's been grossly overworked. Gaga should know that the secret to good art is to know when to pull back and when to let the viewer/listener make assumptions and interpretations on their own. When an artist starts to explain the work (G.U.Y. standing for 'Girl Under You), it fails. That said, it's best to just move on and hope for something better in the future.
0060989157|5.0|i didn't like this book that much when i first started reading it because the crue i loved as a kid just seemed too mean and crude,  but soon was hooked.... this is an amazing book.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I liked the plot in Ender's Game, but not the way it was written. There was too much time spent on the first half of the book and not enough on the second half, in my opinion. The author did much better in this book, especially telling the story through quotations from memos and notes and such - very well done, and a good story to boot. My only reason for four stars instead of five is because I was disappointed in the big reveal at the end. I was expecting something...different. The whole breeding thing seemed weird and irrelevant given the build-up. But again, that's just my opinion.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I expected this to be a teen angst movie, and was pleasantly surprised to find it was very entertaining and well acted.<br />The vision of the future &#34;haves&#34; was quite out there - I loved seeing Stanley Tucci in a blue wig.  I was captivated by the story, once I suspended disbelief about the basic premise.  Jennifer Lawrence was terrific.
B001NHNG64|4.0|'Die Trying' is the second volume in the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child and it is a good one.  The action is constant from beginning to end.<br /><br />This is also the second book that I have read in the series.  It is thoroughly entertaining throughout.<br /><br />Reacher is an ex Army military policeman who happens upon the kidnapping of a woman who turns out to be an FBI agent.  He is taken also just because he is in the wrong place at the wrong time.  There is a big twist in the story when it is revealed who the kidnapping victim is (other than an agent).  That tidbit leads to severeral interesting dynamics, which I will not discuss to avoid spoiling it.<br /><br />Although the author is great at crafting an interesting tale, he makes some errors that indicate either poor research or bad editing at times.  These are not issues that are huge, but they diminish his credibility with knowledgeable readers.  Here are two examples:  The author references the Montana State Police twice.  There is no such organization.  Montana has  a Highway Patrol, but not a state police force per se.  Also, he talks about Reacher not being able to sprint a mile because of his large size.  Regardless of size, he would not be able to sprint that distance as no one else can either.  That is not a sprinting distance.  Neither of those are huge issues, but the author and his editor should work more on being technically accurate.<br /><br />In spite of that, this is an entertaining read that I can easily recommend.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|\\"Black Masquerade\\" is an excellent concert film of Rainbow's 1995 appearance in Dusseldorf for the legendary Rockpalast TV program...The sound is amazing and the film is clear and well-shot with thankfully long, lingering camera shots (i.e., it does not look like some goofy music video-style film crammed with frantic, quick edits.)<br /><br />Ritchie Blackmore has made a career of surrounding himself with amazing talent, many of whom were relatively unknown when they played with him. This version of Blackmore's Rainbow is no exception. Singer Doogie White is just terrific...he interprets Dio, Bonnet and Turner with ease and grace and presents the then new Rainbow material with a delicate, yet natural, style. White has a strong voice, good range and a lovely pure tone. While he may not have the dramatic and forceful persona of Ronnie James Dio, he is a terrific natural performer. Although vocally they are White's equal, as a performer, I prefer White to Turner or Bonnet.<br /><br />The rest of the band is great as well. What may surprise you is that Blackmore is playing better than ever. His guitar tone is the thick strat tone found on \\"Stranger in Us All\\" which, if you are unfamiliar with that record, most closely resembles his tone on Deep Purple's \\"Perfect Strangers\\" record. Thankfully, the weird octaver sounds of the later Turner-era Rainbow concerts is gone. He is clearly very inspired in this ensemble and plays beautifully throughout this set.<br /><br />Good set list as well. Almost half the set is new material which sounds even better live than on the record.  \\"Ariel\\" is epic and powerful, as is \\"Black Masquerade\\". The 1975 classic \\"Temple of the King\\" is reinterpreted and performed beautifully. \\"Perfect Strangers\\" is surprisingly good here as well. I would have loved to see them perform \\"Gates of Babylon\\" or \\"Self-Portrait\\" with this ensemble, but it was not to be. What we have is an excellent, perhaps final document of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow...it is afine end to a powerful and influential band.<br /><br />Long live Blackmore!!!
B0014H32MG|5.0|Could not wait to find out the outcome but didn't want it to end either.  Would have enjoyed more at the end.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is my 5th gaming headset, and it is without a doubt the best one I've worked with. I am looking forward to see how long this lasts because it is simply amazing. If you are looking for an affordable gaming headset, stop your research right here, this is the product you are looking for.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Found it very easy to setup. Only downsides are the lack of apps and the extremely bright LED on the device.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Very engaging story that I couldn't put down.  The profiles told in story form are amazing, shocking, disturbing and sad.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Big fan off his music! I really enjoyed the different types of songs on this cd. This is his best yet!
B007G5O3K0|5.0|There is not a song on this CD that I do not like. The music makes the best of Morten's incredible vocal range and the music suits his voice brilliantly. This CD is not to be missed by any Morten Harket fans! Absolutely beautiful!
B008JFUS28|4.0|It's not that \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" is any less extravagant than \\"Thor\\" since you still spend a fair amount of time in Asgard and it's still just as impressive as it was in the first film, but \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" is a darker film in comparison. This seems like an obvious statement since the enemy of the film is Malekith and his Dark Elves while Aether is a form of dark energy, but the visuals in the film are extremely dark. The time spent in Svartalfeim can contribute to this since the realm is volcanic and ashy. However the entire film seems to purposely be coated in this dark filter and isn't nearly as bright and vibrant as \\"Thor\\" is.<br /><br />Depending on how you felt about the cast the first time around, the superhero sequel is unlikely to waiver your opinion one way or another. Tom Hiddleston aims for the moon with his performance and doesn't disappoint. Loki is a powerhouse in \\"Thor: The Dark World.\\" With his unpredictable nature and ceaseless trickery, Loki is a character that everyone seems to love and for good reason. His commentary is worth the price of admission alone. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is fantastic as Kurse, but it's mostly due to how superb his costume and prosthetics are. Tadanobu Asano gets even less screen time than he did in the first film and Christopher Eccleston is solid as Malekith, but it's the way the character is written that's disappointing. At the end of the day, looking past all the bells and whistles of the Aether, Malekith is basically a pushover. Bringing back Rene Russo as Thor's mother Frigga is also a confusing addition, especially with how her story arc plays out. Aside from a couple really enjoyable cameos in the film, the appearance of Chris O'Dowd was quite a pleasant surprise especially if you're a fan of \\"The IT Crowd.\\"<br /><br />It's intriguing to consider that \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" has a slightly higher budget than its predecessor since the original film is so much flashier in comparison. The Dark Elves, Kurse, the spaceship battles, and the Aether must have cost a pretty penny. The Aether is constantly moving, flows like a liquid, and is red in appearance. So when it takes over Jane's body and she starts having visions about how this red river inside her is going to destroy the universe, you can't help but choke back jokes about Jane's monthly visitor. Next to their impressive space crafts, The Dark Elves have alien weaponry like spears that shoot lasers and black hole grenades that are extremely fun to watch in action.<br /><br />\\"Thor: The Dark World\\" feels like a different film than \\"Thor.\\" There's this somber atmosphere in the sequel that seems to always hint at impending doom. While Malekith seems to be threatening the existence of everything, he's dealt with so easily. Thor is torn between restoring order to the nine realms, the love of his life, and taking over his father's throne. So why does so much time seem to be given to Kat Dennings, her intern, and Stellan Skarsgard running around naked in Stonehenge?<br /><br />\\"Thor: The Dark World\\" is visually enticing, but in a more ominous way than in the first film. With extraordinary special effects and an inclusive story, \\"Thor: The Dark World\\" is sure to be well-liked by those who loved the first film and a must-see for any fan of the Marvel Studios films but fails to be as exhilarating and as well done as \\"Thor.\\"the spaceship battles, and the Aether must have cost a pretty penny.

B007EE564U|5.0|My first read of Vince Flynn. Thought it was a great plot, and different enough from others to be a real page turner. If you like child or baldacci you'll enjoy this.
B001GA1RFA|4.0|I'm such a fan of Green' s work.  I wanted another 5 star read... bad!  This came soo close!  All the math threw me off..I wanted more Colin, and Lindsey..if not, maybe one more Katherine.  Cute book, though:)
B0014DQSGW|5.0|This is my favorite kind of romantic comedy.  I like them sweet and predictable, and NOT raunchy!  I want more like this! Loved it.
0812550706|5.0|In most books the protagonist is the hero; readers want to like the main character. There are many different protagonists in books, from a loving and romantic one to a more violent and dark one. To illustrate characters in  books  an author uses characterization. Characterization gives a greater understanding of the characters.In  Enders Game  Orson Scott Card uses characterization by switches the point of view from  the protagonist to almost all characters in the book;creating an intense interweaving of ideas and thoughts .Orson Scott Card greatly uses characterization to enhance the novel; he develops and creates another world within each character.<br /><br />Ender Wiggins comes from a family of genesis. Ender has a brother named Peter and a sister, Valentine. Ender is the smartest of the family and for that Peter hates Ender as do Enders Classmates.Therefore Ender is bullied  by almost everyone he meets.Ender is saved however when  Colonel Graff of the International Fleet selects him to be in a secluded program training kids for an upcoming war where Ender is put into a Battle school. Within Battle school the students play warlike games.Ender excels at these games and rapidly moves up the ranks. Within a few years Ender is accepted to command school. Throughout the entire book Ender is controlled by the adults or leaders; they put Ender through physically demanding lessons and activities . With the adults controlling him  Ender is controlled to doing something devastating.<br /><br />The Author Orson Scott Card provides the reader with intense emotion throughout. For instance when the reader first meets Peter the reader feel enraged towards him; \\"I could kill you like this  Peter whispered [to Ender] just press and press until you're dead. And I could say that I didn't know that it would kill you, that we were just playing and they would believe me, and everything would be fine . And you would be dead\\" (12). This demonstrates how savage and cruel Peter is, making the reader angry towards Peter, yet sympathetic for Ender and what he is going through. throughout the entire book people want to kill Ender because of his dominate intelligence. When Ender is caught by surprise he Is forced to fight Bonzo. Although Bonzo is stronger than Ender Ender delivers a grueling blow to nose, Although ; \\"Bonzo did not cry out in pain. He did not react at all, except that his body rose in the air. It was as if Ender had kicked a piece of furniture. Bonzo collapsed, fell to the side...\\" (211). Despite the fact that Ender didn't mean to kill Ender Ender has been marked as a killer to the people. With Ender killing Bonzo the reader is still compassionate for ender because Bonzo bullied Ender.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card provides the reader with a different perspective as each chapter is presented with a changing point of view. Every chapter the perspective is change to another character. During each chapter Colonel Graff speaks to major Anderson on what he is planning for ender, providing  a introduction to each chapter; \\"we've planned an impromptu course of study [for ender]\\" (255). The book changes pace when the reader enters in the mind of  Valentine, for she must deal with Peter. Valentine is brought into Peters mind when she sees \\"a squirrel half skinned, spiked by its little hands and feet with twigs pushed in the dirt. She pictured Peter trapping it, staking it, then carefully parting and peeling the skin back carefully without breaking into  the abdomen\\"(88). Valentine is horrified by her brother peter and his actions letting  the reader to know what she must go through.The point of view is changed to give the reader a better understanding of the characters.<br /><br /> Enders Game is intriguing book to read as well as a  well written novel. The characters are fully developed and provide a significant boost to the plot.. The futuristic world is like no other. No other fiction book I have read in the last few years can compare to how much I liked Enders Game.

B001MM28JG|4.0|There are scifi movies that struggle at being realistic and struggle at convincing the audience that they are realistic.<br /><br />This movie is upfront about its ridiculousness. Having gotten that out of the way, it could then invest its energy in developing an interesting story line, fine comedic acting and a believable moral-of-the-story.

B000QE9ERK|5.0|People who have come to see the/a devil in action in this movie will see none.<br /><br />Satan mocks those who worships her, if there is such a being. She mocks, as does the movie, the secrecy and rituals behind those who either worship or revile her.<br /><br />Certainly the most sacred of angels will not let herself degraded with being worshiped by humans. But to hide her purity behind a mask perceived as eternal evil. Yet, she has her desire for a persistent companion.<br /><br />Companions whose finite lives would help her find her next desired companion. A companion resourceful enough to match the puzzle she and a previous companion had devised. Others fail, except the one she fancies and who fancies her.<br /><br />Thro the 9th Gate she finds her eternal companion. Perhaps, she is an extraterrestrial. She does not even call herself Satan. It's the myth of Satan the producers are using as decoys to distract the audience. It's not a horror movie. It is an exquisite deliberately misleading movie, using established religious ideas to mislead the audience, into finally realising they are watching an exotic romance movie between a human and an extraterrestrial.<br /><br />The unsuspecting chosen one whose unsuspecting competing suitors unsuspectingly perform all the rituals for him. Are those rituals actually required to win her heart, or are rituals simply decoys??? AFA the story goes, the rituals also function as pointless impediments towards other suitors besides her chosen. Why 9th? What are gates zero to eight for? They are simply plates of engravings that lead the chosen suitor to obtain the 9th plate/gate, which helps the right suitor identify his lover. Rather, should we say the 9th plate is plate zero, the actual plate he needs to find. Ground zero, towards which the other nine plates would lead the suitor.<br /><br />Is this her ultimate companion, the only one admitted thro the gate or is he yet another companion who would help her write another set of puzzles? Rather, is that it - the extraterrestrial, the dragon rider, is going home as she's finally found her lover?

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|There isn't one movie which stars Denzel Washington that I do not enjoy.<br /><br />Let's not listen to airplane engineers or their enthusiasts diss about how structurally implausible it is to fly a plane upside down. Really, the plane wouldn't even last the few, 5 minutes it had to go thro landing upside down?<br /><br />Anyway, technical plausibilities aside, it is  the usual fine directing, cast and acting that would accompany a Denzel movie.

I've reduced the number of botched shots I take by knowing what the optimal settings are for a variety of environments. The technical understanding comes a long separately from this book, but this gives you explicit instructions on how to take the shot.
B009RX8MQ0|2.0|Let me start by saying that I LOVED Season 1.  I give Season 1 a 4.5 out of 5.  I loved Emily Thorne and Nolan, and I enjoyed the little interactions between all the characters.  And I enjoyed the other characters by themselves as well.  From manipulative Victoria, to good guy Daniel; the Grayson family had some pretty awesome personalities to enjoy.  Watching Emily Thorne slowly get her revenge, piece by piece, was one of the heights of my Summer.  Although I didn't think it was perfect, it was still an excellent show.<br /><br />  However......Season 2 was just plain awful.  From the Clarke mother subplot, to the Initiative main plot; it seemed like the writers lost sight of what drew people in.  Characters pulled 180's, and their regular habits and personalities started becoming more annoying than interesting.  Emily's plot for revenge for her father got pushed WAAAAAY to the side in favor of this new boring Initiative plot. And finally, the motivations behind the Initiative just left you scratching your head at the ridiculousness of it all.  Not too mention that the Graysons became SO evil, that they no longer felt like actual characters, so much as people that the writers thought &#34;Well, what other evil demented thing could we put in their past to stir up more drama?&#34;  I'm going to go in-depth into the areas I thought were especially bad, so feel free to skip to the last paragraph if you don't want to read it and/or don't want to be spoiled.<br /><br />  First up, the romance with Aiden, it felt extremely forced....I mean, you see the guy show up in one episode, and in the very next, we have a flashback showing him and Emily together and then......well that's all the buildup we see for why they're together.  From that boring setup, I felt absolutely no attachment or care for the ups and downs of their relationship.  Stale doesn't even begin to describe it.<br /><br />  The part that bothered me the most was how Emily started doing things that made littlesense, and caused her and her friends more trouble than her enemies.  Actually, it seemed like she spent most of season 2 HELPING the Graysons instead of trying to get revenge on them.  Emily's actions become especially ridiculous when she starts helping the Graysons become more powerful than ever.  You'll see Emily stop more people from trying to make the Graysons pay for the awful things they've done in this season than you'll see her try to hurt the Graysons herself.<br /><br />  I also hated what they did to the other characters.  Daniel became disgustingly hypocritical, Victoria became a walking cliché, Nolan's role in the show was drastically reduced to make room for random lover Aiden, and innocent Ashley became just another monster like the rest of the Graysons.  I mean, from season 1, you'd think if any Grayson was going to turn out good it would be Daniel.  But he essentially mirrors his father in just about every way in this season ALL THE WHILE condemning how evil his parents are.  SPOILERS: he tries to frame the man his fiancé briefly dated for a terrorist act his family is responsible for, learns the truth about David Clarke and tries to help his family cover it up, and blackmails/bullies Nolan out of greed.  Not even halfway through the second season, and I hated Daniel Grayson even more than I did his Dad.  At least Conrad admits he's a monster whose out to save himself and profit from it.  Daniel will preach from a moral high ground that doesn't exist, all the while performing nearly the same actions his parents are.  And the way he's so easily manipulated to dance from one person's tune to the next made it very hard to feel any connection to his character's emotions when you know they aren't really his.  Also, Charlotte and Daniel's relationship with their parents becomes like a running gag too with how often they switch sides.<br /><br />  And Victoria....she becomes so annoying because she loses any and all tact she ever had.  Just about everytime she opens her mouth, it's to insult someone.  She used to be excellent at mincing words, and appearing to have an enticing social personality, even if she was actually pretty evil on the inside.  However, in season 2, that elegance about her disappears, and she just becomes a person who you KNOW when she's getting ready to say something to someone, it's going to be to be to belittle them or someone else.  Also, she shares Daniel's new personality flaw in that she constantly preaches from a moral high ground.....that doesn't exist.  It gets old really fast....And did anyone else find the number of evil deeds that the show claims she and her husband did in their past actually TAKES AWAY from the story instead of adding to it?  I mean, so many skeletons come out of the closet that the atrocities done to David Clarke kind of start getting overlooked....<br /><br />  All in all, this season felt like a completely different show from the first one....and a much worse show at that.  The only reason I'm not giving this season a 1 star out of 5, is for the same reason I feel people are heaping 4 and 5 stars on this season.....loyalty to the first season....and hope for the future.  I so hope they get back to the original concept of the show, because this season had little-to-nothing to do with revenge.  It really felt like a silly 'spy' thriller.....I haven't seen season 3 yet, but I don't think it can be much worse than this.  I really hope season 3 is more like season 1 than 2 at least.

B004H4XAXO|5.0|I've been busy with life and have been neglecting my reading a lot! Then I spotted a tweet from Brandon himself about how this book was selling for a pittance on Amazon and I grabbed it and I am really glad I did. The story is rich and beautifully conceived and written and it compels you to just keep reading, one more page, just to see what will happen next or to try and piece together the little clues dropped along the way, the plot deliciously coalescing into a can't-put-down story of honour, love, deceit and betrayal, with a healthy dose of magic thrown in for good measure.

B00BEIYMZ6|1.0|Wow, I don't know if the producers of this lame movie paid to have people post all of the good reviews but this film is DU-Umb!  I mean if they try and sell a two hour movie on a 50 year old Jennifer Aniston strip tease (that is lame at best) then Woo-Hoo what a great film - NOT!  Seriously do not waste your money, wait until Wal Mart has it in the .99 cent box (next week) if your even mildly interested in seeing this film.  I mean WOW this film was bad.

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has gone from strength to strength with each novel he has written since his luminous debut \\"The Kite Runner\\". While that book moved me with the haunting story of the consequences of a childhood betrayal, I felt that the writing did not match up to the brilliance of the story. I felt much the same way with his second novel about mothers and daughters, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\", but it is this novel, his third, that I felt that his writing reached a new pinnacle.<br /><br />His storytelling style hasn't changed per se - it still flits from character to character across the continents, from Afganistan, to Paris, to a little Greek island Tinos, and even San Francisco, and even timelines that stretch from the 1940s to the 2010s. Needless to say, add to that the non-linear narrative, it can be confusing at times. However I find that sometimes it is easier to be wholly immersed in each character's story and figure out the connections later, because it does become clear along the way. And to Hosseini's credit, each story frame is self-contained enough for the reader to be captivated and enthralled. Oftentimes, I found myself hankering for more of a particular character's story when the chapter closes and the story picks up elsewhere. Hosseini has managed to reel me in and make me care about each set of characters, and it is testament to Hosseini's craft at creating memorable characters, that this reader feels a pang of sadness when the story moves on.<br /><br />At the heart of it, the novel is a story about the bond between a young brother-and-sister pair, Abdullah, 10, and Pari, 3, from a small Afghan village, whose lives take a sharp turn when their father takes them to the big city of Kabul. The pair is separated, but Abdullah, who has been more a parent than his own stepmother was to Pari, is left with an emptiness that is too large to fill: \\"Pari hovered, unbidden, at the edge of Abdullah's vision everywhere he went. She was like the dust that clung to his shirt. She was in the silences that had become so frequent at the house, silences that welled up between their words, sometimes pregnant with things that went unsaid, like a cloud filled with rain that never fell.\\" Altogether too much to bear for a child.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the novel there are tales of unexpected love, the irreconcilable contradiction that is the relationship between a parent and a child, and the triumphs and inexplicable tragedies that hit ordinary people in everyday life, sometimes so emotionally draining they would run the risk of cheap sentimentality in the hands of a less able author. From the myriad narrative threads, Hosseini manages to weave them into an astonishing conclusion, which is both redemptive and poignant.
B00C6ZDBXU|4.0|Whenever I hear a great rocking song on classic hits radio I wonder \\"Why don't bands make songs like this any more?\\"  The answer is \\"They Do!\\"  Snapshot by The Strypes is fantastic, incorporating classic rock music with great lyrics.  Reminiscent at times of The Animals, Dr Feelgood and Lew Lewis Reformer, the original songs on Snapshot are as good as any I have heard since, since..., whenever!<br /><br />Despite the fine covers of songs by Bo Diddley, Willie Dixon, Nick Lowe and Muddy Waters, my favourite songs on the disc are those composed by Josh McClorey and Evan Walsh.  These guys are amazing musicians and great singers, imparting just the right amount of grit and growl.  My only complaint about Snapshot is there are not enough original songs.

B00FHATBGW|5.0|Another winner from Big Fish Games! They never disappoint. This game has loads of neat places to explore, easy hidden object scenes and some very challenging puzzles to solve. I had a great time playing this game, as I do most all games by Big Fish. I am so ready for the sequel. I wish we could get more than just one new game a week because a lot of them are for kids. It would be great to get three or four a week or at least have the sequels come out a lot sooner. I definitely would recommend this game to all of those HOS enthusiasts. Keep them coming Big Fish.

B005LW5J9O|4.0|...but it doesn't quite live up to the hyperbole of the title or the blurbs on the book jacket. This will be of interest to greek and roman history buffs and people who are into the humanities (in the original sense of the word). Very well written, but I feel like there wasn't enough meat on the bones of this story to justify a whole book. Still, it makes you think about the modern mind-set in a different way, and you'll definitely pick up some cool facts for cocktail party chatter.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|it is a great love story, I have all the books and they are great if you can see the love story in it
006202406X|1.0|I loved the first 2 and was so excited for this one. Turns out that was for nothing because this book was horrible. It starts of choppy and skips ahead without picking up where the last one left off. Then when the story finally picks up she kills it with the worst possible ending. Do no read this book!

B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This album is the best thing to ever happen to pop music. It truly combines ART and POP to create a hybrid that cannot be matched.  Each song is different but distinctly Gaga. You can tell she was happy while recording this album and it shines through the music. I would definitely suggest purchasing this for yourself and friends. LOVE ARTPOP
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is certainly fun to play and entertaining, but this is sub-par as a &quot;puzzle&quot; game. Puzzle games shouldn't depend on random chance when it come to the orientation of the pieces. Especially when the game frequently has harsh limits on the number of moves allowed, and an even more strict chances to try. If you want more, then you have to wait long periods, per life lost; or pay cash. Though, that may be the point.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|I like dramatic movies, but, this thing was just horrible. Too predictable and not believable at all. This type character that Denzel played has been overdone by Tom Cruise et al.<br /><br />Worst $6 I ever spent on a movie.

B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Story and acting were good. However, the nudity and alcohol and drug abuse shown was excessive. A good movie does not need to show nudity, cussing, etc. in order to be convincing and good!
B00BWQW73E|3.0|As another reviewer wrote, \\"I wasn't really planning on reviewing this book, because I was mentioned in it several times and it didn't seem appropriate.\\"<br /><br />But that same reviewer said he had the chance to fact-check \\"his\\" section of the book before it was published. And he said he knows of at least one other of Brad Stone's sources who had that opportunity.<br /><br />I was not offered - nor did I expect - a prepublication review. The author interviewed too many people to offer them all that opportunity. So it would be wrong to believe that anyone who participated could read a draft and offer corrections where necessary. (That other reviewer, incidentally, has explained that he insisted on prepublication review as a precondition of his interview. I made no such demand.)<br /><br />If I had read the book beforehand, I would have pointed out a minor factual error and one big problem of context. The author says that back in high school, Jeff answered a bank teller's question \\"cockily.\\" Reading that made me wince, because I was there, and Jeff wasn't cocky - he was sincere. With that loaded and inaccurate word, the author mischaracterized the tone of the episode. I don't know where he got \\"cockily,\\" but it's wrong, and I wonder if it sheds some light on the author's overall interpretation of my old friend. It seems like, in the words of another (very smart) reviewer, \\"a narrative trick.\\"<br /><br />Brad Stone is a talented writer, and his book is engaging. Yet as another reviewer points out, \\"A new 372 page book has some errors.\\"<br /><br />I can live with some mistakes. Lord knows I make `em. But in a book that is marketed as meticulously researched and thoroughly fact-checked, how many is too many? Another (also very smart) reviewer says that of the facts he has particular knowledge of, the author gets things right about 80 percent of the time.<br /><br />This isn't a newspaper article written over the course of a few hours, or even a magazine piece written over a month or two. With books, authors have many months, or even years. The standards are different. While I understand that a few mistakes are likely to slip into even the most rigorously fact-checked book, this one seems to have a lot.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, the book is a lopsided reflection my friend of more than 30 years. His famous laugh is portrayed as \\"punishing\\" rather than warm, and there is barely any indication of Jeff's sincerity, his humor, his good nature, his abiding integrity.<br /><br />Stone tells an interesting story, but he doesn't tell a full one.

0802473156|4.0|I found the book to be very readable. Overall I thought that the concept of love languages to be very interesting, I ordered the book and read it immediately after it arrived and then asked my wife to read as soon as possible. We are scheduled to participate in a Marriage Encounter Weekend in the near future and my thought was that these concepts could be useful to both of us on that weekend, We have been married for over 38 years and have a very mature and wonderful love for each other, But, as the book says, it could always be better.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Highly recommend for viewers of all ages. Spirited Away is a timeless film that should not be overlooked if you are not into the whole Japanese anime thing or animated films. This movie is great for the whole family and will leave the kids sort of spooked and intrigued by the great animation and characters and the adults will appreciate that this isn't only a film for children, it actually is a great coming of age story of a young girl with a poor attitude who gets put into an extraordinary situation and learns to handle things on her own.
B002E2M3KM|3.0|Add me to the list of buyers that received a warped record. It's playable but warped enough to make the arm jump when first dropped. Not cool. Need to remember to start the record with the needle already on it. If I paid $20+ I'd be upset but I scored it on sale for about $8 shipped. Unfortunately I waited too long to check the record out and missed the return date by 2 days so don't make the same mistake I did. Still, even with the warp distortion it sounds better than most of what you find used (those Queen records went to a lot of parties) but in this condition it's not worth list price. Nice job on the gatefold. I know these pressing plants are booked to the max but something really needs to be done about quality control as warping is an all too common problem these days.

B004M9ZI0M|4.0|“The Tempest” directed by Julie Taymor (2010) is a very well done and enjoyable movie. Just it is too bad that the directors, of this and other Shakespeare’s adaptations, cannot help but to try to bend the plots so they would fit into their own personal beliefs or preferred concepts. In the case of “The Tempest”, an attempt is made to indicate that Caliban is liberated from Prospera. Caliban’s episode is an apparent reference to the colonization of the New World.<br />Shakespeare’s plays have an outward and inner content. Therefore, it may be said that they have a built-in ambiguity. The outward content includes a whole spectrum of human endeavours, e.g., sociology, philosophy, religion, politics, psychology, history, mysticism, arts, etc., etc. Therefore, each play may be interpreted in accordance with a set of assumptions used in these various fields of intellectual and emotional inquiry. Depending on a particular assumption, one may arrive at different interpretations of a play or an episode. This sort of outward interpretations can be easily recognized, because (i) they can be applied only to a selected play or an episode, and (ii) require exclusions or modifications of some parts of the original text. This built-in ambiguity is deliberate. Its purpose is to help the audience to identify all sorts of intellectual and emotional conditioning that prevent them from recognizing the operation of more subtle evolutionary forces.<br />The inner content of Shakespeare’s plays is based on a unique design. This design is governed by a set of rules of an evolutionary process that is not limited by intellectual or emotional barriers; neither its operation is limited by time or space. At this level all scenes and episodes of all Shakespeare’s plays converge into a coherent narrative.<br />According to this inner narrative, Caliban is of European origin. The particular faculty symbolically represented by Caliban was formed in the past. Namely, Caliban is a result of the fiasco of the Roman evolutionary cycle described in Shakespeare’s Roman plays. The link is indicated in “Titus Andronicus”, the concluding play of the Roman plays.<br />In his conversation with Ariel, Prospero indicates that he knows the origin of Caliban’s mother. This is why Prospero, an Italian Duke, declares:<br />  “This thing of darkness! Acknowledge mine.”<br />This particular faculty is spiritually distractive:<br />  “He is as disproportion’d in his manners<br />As in his shape.”<br />This faculty has to be subdued to a more advanced aspect of the human mind, if evolutionary progress is to be made. Prospero represents such an advanced aspect. In other words, Caliban cannot be “liberated”. This particular faculty may only be reformed in such a way as to become completely obedient to the advanced aspect. And this is exactly what Shakespeare indicates:<br />  “Go, sirrah, to my cell;<br />  Take with you your companions; as you look<br />  To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.”<br />The above two quotes are crucial to understanding the character of Caliban (The audience watching Taymor’s production may note that these two quotes have been cut off from the movie).<br />At the end of the play Caliban clearly declares what his role is:<br />  “How fine my master is!”<br />Therefore, any attempts of presenting ‘The Tempest’ in the context of post-colonial theories are baseless and misrepresent the intent of the play.

0451457994|5.0|2001: A Space Odyssey is a true gem of a science fiction classic. Known. Proven. Timeless. Et Cetra. One of the first sci fi books I ever read, and still one of the best. Truly well done, as the story unfold so that the characters are having the all-encompassing HUMAN experience. His relatively accurate foresight for humanity is quite astounding. I loved each of his story innovations, from the alien monolith device to HAL to traveling through space and time. Beautifully written. Clarke's descriptions of the moons and planets and his use of metaphor in doing so was a joy to read and imagine. And, suffice to say, each one of the characters in the novel, Francis Poole, Dave Bowman, and HAL are some of the most famous sci-fi characters of all time!
B008JFUR10|5.0|I love this movie. I really really love it.  As an anime fan, it was the culmination of all my childhood mecha anime dreams!  It so reminded me of the weekends I would spend watching Robotech as a child.  Now could the script have been better? Yes.  Could the acting had been better? Yes.  But the acting wasn't bad either.  I didn't feel like I had to endure someone's awful attempt at acting.  Besides that, the special effects blew my mind and let's face it, they're freakin' giant robots battling giant monsters!  That's full of win!  So if you're a scifi/fantasy/horror fan, you're gonna like this flick and you're gonna like it a lot.
0451169514|3.0|IT by Stephen King is okay. It's better than okay compared to most other books, but for King's potential, this doesn't live up to his masterpieces of The Shining, Christine, Salem's Lot, The Stand, etc. It's a bit long-winded at time and the orgy between children just seems forced and kind of creepy. But the book does have many well done points. I particularly loved the historic flashbacks of Pennywise throughout the town's history. I also happened to enjoy the story when told from the kids point of view as children... reminded me of Stand By Me. When they became adults and returned to the town, the story just seemed to lose its footing. The issue of everyone forgetting what occurred once leaving the town also seemed forced. There was no need for it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|fun game, really graphic but entertaining.  hate waiting for more energy or weapons upgrades that I already earned seems like a double penalty.
0307596885|3.0|I am a huge Alice Munro fan, but I agree with the other negative reviewers that these stories fall pretty flat. I enjoyed \\"Admundsen\\", \\"Corrie,\\" \\"In Sight of the Lake\\" and \\"Dear Life\\" the most. Of all the characters in this collection, I was most intrigued by the gardener in \\"In Sight of the Lake\\". I believe he was meant to be a kind of psychopomp. He is dressed all in black as the Grim Reaper is described to be. Also, in the Bible when Jesus was first raised from the dead, the people coming to his tomb initally mistake him for a gardener. So, I wonder if the protagonist's meeting with him foreshadowed her fast-approaching death (or succumbing to Alzheimers, which can be seen as a kind of death).<br /><br />If you're wondering how Alice Munro could have won the Nobel Prize, please read \\"Selected Stories\\" which contains the best of her earlier work. Every story in that collection is amazing.
B00ALUHNX6|4.0|I am glad I read this book. It made me think about things about designing a game that I probably thought about in passing but was now made to think about them for real. Overall a good structure, though it can get tedious at times, and I prefer theory like this over the specifics about programming or platforms or such because if you know what you are doing, you can learn to develop with anything. It's the ability to design that work that so many people lack and this book tries to teach.<br /><br />As for the lenses, they are a good idea. An easy way to go back over all the ideas with your own work by using the mobile app. No skimming throug the book. It's just that at times it came across as forced, a real stretch to make something into a \\"lens\\", which was reinforced at the end by the fact that there is, no surprise, exactly 100 lenses.<br /><br />What a nice, round number.<br /><br />In the end, I recommend this book if you really want to be a designer of better things, rather than just another hack.
B00FKAA4DS|3.0|Was really anticipating this release.  Unfortunately, the two singles that were released prior to this album really were the best singles from this album.  Eminem is still on his toes, but this album really pales in comparison.... despite Rick Rubin's help.
B008B8AOQI|4.0|I love this type of music and enjoyed this album.  I would say that Passenger resembles a British version of Joshua Radin.  A smooth folk style music with good lyrics and solid guitar work.<br /><br />Things That Stop You Dreaming is my personal favorite song, but I am a sucker for anything that has a cello and acoustic guitar.  A memorable song with high replay value.  The Wrong Direction is my second favorite song.  A catchy tune with pleasant guitar work and a pleasant chorus.  While all the other songs on the album are solid songs (some more popular than others), I find them to be a little repetitive and not so memorable.<br /><br />I listened to this cd and enjoyed the heck out of it for a good 5-10 plays through, but find only a couple songs to last past 10 listens.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I almost never write a review about a DVD/Blu-ray that haven't come out yet and it comes out officially tomorrow and I will get it.<br />It's one of the few blockbusters that came out this past summer that I've been waiting to pick up, Man Of Steel is not a perfect film but I think it is the Superman we all finally deserve.<br />If you truly want the 'comic book' version of the character watch Superman The Movie with Christopher Reeve that movie in my opinion will never be surpassed for classic Superman but Reeve isn't with us anymore and the silver screen needs a current Superman. I love the Nolan Batman films and as I think most people will agree Superman Returns was a fun but very weak attempt to recreate the Reeve years.<br />Kevin Spacey is an amazing actor but completely wasted in that film because all he did was ape Gene Hackman's portrayal when he could have been saved for this franchise and been the most menacing Luthor ever.<br />Man Of Steel to me is the perfect flipside of the coin to Batman Begins, while Batman is an intellectual and uses mostly his brain Superman is the brawn and while the Dark Knight Trilogy is mostly a drama Man Of Steel is mostly an action film.<br />I love THIS Superman and Cavill is perfectly cast as is Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and the rest... THIS is the Superman we finally deserve.<br />The only thing to ruin it is the casting of Ben Affleck as Batman in the forthcoming sequel ... Christian Bale really should be back in the cape & cowl again for Man Of Steel or whatever it is called.<br />But this Man Of Steel it seems is already going to be another stand alone movie because I'm certainly not interested in seeing Ben Affleck as Batman in the sequel... it really is a pity because Man Of Steel complimented Batman Begins so well, just as Batman and Superman should be: opposite sides of the same coin.<br />Light and dark, day and night, hope and obsession...<br />I was so happy when I saw MOS steel in the cinema and sawit 5 times, it's not my favorite action film or even comic book movie but I agree with another reviewer on here that has said people can't seem to make up their mind what they want in a Superman film.<br />It will never be Christopher Reeve again, and they already tried that and failed with Superman Returns. I loved MOS because it was a reinvention of the cinematic version of the character exactly the same that Batman Begins was a reinvention of Batman and both work wonderfully.<br />Man Of Steel was also more than just a new Superman movie, I'm not religious but the allegory to Christ was unmistakable giving the story layers and comparing Superman/Clark Kent to Jesus Chris has been in the comics for decades...<br />Also, and no one else seems to see this besides Man Of Steel being a great Superman film it is also in its own right the best science fiction movie I've seen in a very long time.<br />If you watch The Day The Earth Stood Still, MOS has many themes very similar to that classic of science fiction. The outsider/alien who tries to save humanity because although he will never truly be a part of it connects with a few individuals who show him that humankind are worth preserving.<br />The invasion of earth and the uncaring tidal force that threatens humanity, and I'm talking the original classic TDTESS not the Keanue Reeves terrible remake movie.<br />Lois in Man Of Steel is like the mother in TDTESS and Kal-El is Kaatu while te Kryptonians and especially Zod of course are akin to Gort... there are so many layers to Man Of Steel that make more than simply an \\"action movie\\" or a \\"superhero\\" movie that blows Superman Returns out of the park.<br />The journey of Kal-El from childhood to adulthood, the Christ allegory, in many ways a much better remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still.<br />This is an intelligent, remarkable, entertaining film filled with action, romance, comedy, wit and even tragedy when Kal-El is forced to decide between his own people who he hassought his entire life and the human race.<br />Do not underestimate MAN OF STEEl, it is a movie worth watching many times over because of all those reasons and more.<br />I do love how Lois and Clarks relationship is subtle, these characters are just meeting for the first time. They don't have time to fall in love yet but they are attracted to each other...<br />Give MAN OF STEEL a chance, it's just a terrible shame that WB and Chris Nolan and Zack Snyder aren't doing everything humanly possible to get Christian Bale to come back for MAN OF STEEL II.
B00F3VOL38|4.0|Once the Beatles secured a recording contract with Parlophone, they obtained their license to take over the world. On this live-in-the-studio companion to 1994's &quot;Live at the BBC&quot;, the Beatles take to the open road again and they sound awfully invigorated as they travel it. This release could be guilty of too-much-overlapping, however, there's enough here to negate much of that theory. For example, I find the versions of &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; and &quot;Memphis, Tennessee&quot; to be considerably more alive and less diffident here.<br /><br />Rock and Roll can be seen as a modern day smoke signal. At their best, the Beatles embody that signal and a lot of the music herein is not just for crazed collectors. In sticking more closely to the Buddy Holly original, their glad spirits are infectious on &quot;Words of Love&quot;, with those delectable two-part harmonies and George's gift of absorbing rockabilly. On a longer version of &quot;Lucille&quot; (this time without the host speaking over the intro), Paul continues to get thrilled at singing those high notes. And it's a thrill in hearing him. Heading their covers repertoire are the peppiness of Chuck Berry's &quot;I'm Talking About You&quot; and a blistering and punked-up version of &quot;Money (That's What I Want)&quot;, in which John utilizes his greatest expressive tool to its fullest. It's the Cavern Club and Hamburg all over again.<br /><br />A few of the originals benefit too. &quot;Misery&quot;, with the din of a young audience, rocks more than the studio cut. George's guitar runs supplant the piano runs. &quot;And I Love Her&quot; is even more striking with strength-over-beauty in its electric arrangement. The dual guitars and harmonies on &quot;If I Fell&quot; are wondrous as it's done at a slightly faster tempo. &quot;I'll Follow the Sun&quot; is given a fresh treatment with its alternate bass pattern. And though virtually identical to the record, they achieve perfection in one take of &quot;She Loves You&quot;.<br /><br />The absence of John's harmonica is a loss on the covers and on the originals, but it's sure nice to hear that &quot;Chains&quot; and &quot;There's a Place&quot; are no longer collecting dust. Hear Ringo's drums on these and also hear his drums and raucous vocals on &quot;Boys&quot; with its trick ending. A born rocker!<br /><br />And the pleasures aren't strictly musical either. Their in-between chatter makes the vibe loose and fun. Never on record has their camaraderie been more evident than in &quot;Never Mind, Eh? and &quot;Brian Bathtubes&quot; is good for a bit of a chuckle.<br /><br />The Pop Profiles section does some incisive probing into each Beatle's life at that time. John focuses on more adult considerations. A prime case in point: his politics on human relations becomes manifest as he discusses putting Julian into a private school in where there would be students of all nationalities. But Paul's profile seems to be the most ironic when it comes to traveling and his fear of flying. George enthuses on advanced production techniques in the music to come. And Ringo mostly claims the privileges of financial reward.<br /><br />This 2-CD set covers that period when the Beatles were the most crucial thing in each of their lives. Most interesting of all, it took place at a time when nobody could have predicted the long-term outcome. So here's another chance to peek into that four-headed monster that ruled the music world, while also being an exceptional reminder of the benefits of collaboration. You get the sense they're still building their empire from scratch, but with an unwavering belief in the music and themselves. Good for the World!uot;She Loves You&quot;.<br /><br />The absence of John's harmonica is a loss on the covers and on the originals, but it's sure nice to hear that &quot;Chains&quot; and &quot;There's a Place&quot; are no longer collecting dust.

B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Dan Torrence returns as an adult in this sequel to The Shining. The story starts with the back history of the Torrence family, and catches the reader up on what Dan's life has been like as an adult. When he starts receiving messages from someone named Abra, the story intensifies. The introduction of the group who call themselves the True Knot, is very creepy. The story rolls along and comes to a satisfying conclusion, but to King fans, this story may not stand out as one of his best or scariest. A good read though.
1451683405|1.0|Having an interest in spiritual knowledge, which takes in free will, the bright red cover caught my attention. After reading this absurdity, I had to give it one star for the marketing strategy of the bright red cover which caught my attention.  Harris argues in this 66 pages of text, that free will, if you can believe this, is an illusion.  Page 5, &#34;Free will is an illusion. Our wills are simply not of our own making. Thoughts and intentions emerge from background causes of which we are unaware and over which we exert no conscious control.&#34;  This book reads more like that of a criminal lawyer trying to defend his client in that the murderer committed the killings without conscious control, ie the absence of free will.  Again, page 5, &#34;Free will is actually more than an illusion (or less), in that it cannot be made conceptually coherent. Either our wills are determined by prior causes and we are not responsible for them, or they are a product of chance and we are not responsible for them.&#34;  I find it hard to grasp that a person with Harris' credentials would even think, let alone support, the notion that free will is predetermined and that any actions or subsequent reactions made by individuals cannot be held accountable because we are not responsible for them.<br />  The book opens up with the brutal account of a home invasion by two would be robbers who murder, rape, terrorize, and burn the home down to cover their trail.  From that point on, Harris is simply making his case, using weak bias based studies, controversial scientific evidence, and cultivated terminology to convince readers that the murderers were not in control of their actions -as if some other prompter was at work within their neural network.  Manchurian Candidate anyone?  Reasoning and rationalization, part of the human condition, allow thought processes in making choices, which ultimately manifest themselves as free will.  The book ending, the &#34;Conclusion&#34;, is a lesson in irrationality which is indeed conclusive of the entire manuscript.irrationality which is indeed conclusive of the entire manuscript.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best game in the world. I waited soooooo long for this to be on kindle. I am so happy. I am a addict to this game, if you are too then say it loud and proud.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|I think LadY GaGa has a great voice. The thing I can't get past is all the other stuff that comes with her. She should focus on her art and gift of singing. She has set out to make herself seem so important that when you hear her music you expect it to be original and cutting edge. Nothing on this album does that, and I do not know when it became cutting edge to make a song explicit instead of making it good. I have listened to a lot of music and everything sounds redone.
B007I5QNRE|2.0|I downloaded the kindle version of this book last night, and immediately started reading.  This is a very good text on drawing.  The author is in tune with proper art educational teaching.  I gave it two stars because the images and video are horrible quality.  Most of us are viewing on hi def screens, and it seems that the images loaded into the kindle version were made for 360p tv.  The images in the hardcover book make for much better enjoyment, scrutiny. e-reading should enhance reading and viewing.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|It was an entertaining movie full of action. I don't understand the poor reviews. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|A movie for those who love a classic action/ Die Hard film!  This movie checks all the boxes for action film requirements with an updated cast.  Nothing new and surprising but still very pleasing and entertaining for fans of the genre.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive about this book before I started it. The Shining was the first book that scared the hell out of me (as an adult I do concede I was way too young to sneak it off the bookshelves and have a go, but hey, at least I was reading!) so I wasn't too sure about a follow up. But Doctor Sleep exceeded every expectation. It is another great offering from Uncle Stevie, I can't wait to read what he does next.

B009CVRQLY|5.0|Céline Dion is back with her eleventh English-language studio album LOVED ME BACK TO LIFE. After over 32 years in the music business and 47 albums under her belt, she has managed to reveal a quite different facet to her already wonderfully accomplished self.<br /><br />Dion is currently residing with her Céline Show featuring 31 musicians, a full orchestra and band at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. That was also where she laid most of her vocals down for the album. She did so at the legendary Studios at the Palms in Las Vegas. She also travelled to Florida to work at the Echo Beach Studio. All of which under the watchful ear of John Mcl. Doelp, album's executive producer. Dion recorded fifteen songs for the album, some of them are new and written especially for her, and the other tracks are her versions of a well-known songs. She wanted to sound different but without drastic disconnection from her legacy. She was ready to take the risk but let's face it, Dion is Dion and her distinct and easily recognisable voice will always be her trademark. No matter how she decides to use it. Her husband, career mentor and a manager René Angélil, pulled all possible strings to make his wife's dream become a reality. He got her to record a duet with R&B star Ne-Yo and Soul legend Stevie Wonder. Diane Warren, Sia Furler and Eg White have all written for her and the legendary Kenny `Babyface' Edwards produced couple of songs too.<br /><br />Céline Dion is very open about her happy existence and having the life she has always dreamed of: wonderful career and loving family. Dion is a master of music interpretation, she does not compose music, nor write lyrics, yet she sings them as they were `her' stories. She does make you feel like she has lived through them all. On this records she wanted to dig deeper into her soul, reaching there to find the Céline rebel and the Céline rock star, and to subsequently give them a new life. Stripped down from voice effects andcomplicated arrangements, she sounds refreshingly real, dry and powerful. And more importantly, with this album she has a great opportunity to reach wider audience and get connected with young listeners. She has never sounded more current. LOVED ME BACK TO LIFE is a fantastic cd which will be found by many under their Christmas trees this winter. Wonderful, they will cherish it for decades.<br /><br />Loved Me Back To Life - is an opening track and first single from the album, it is a powerful ballad co-written for Dion by Sia Furler, who co-wrote (and sung on) David Guetta's Titanium and Rhianna's Diamonds. Lyrically, the track is not far from what Dion has recorded in the past. What's different and new is the way she delivers it. Her voice sounds darker and sexier. All of this with a wonderful addictive dubstep-y beat drop with an amazing vocal hook. Fresh and current.<br /><br />Somebody Loves Somebody - here Dion moves to the dancefloor with this fantastically produced track by the Swedish Play Production. She is strong, sexy and yet again, very current.<br /><br />Incredible - is a duet with Ne-Yo who also co-wrote it. This is album's second single and also a strong candidate for the upcoming Winter Olympics' theme. Despite being such different artists, Dion shows how versatile she can be and just how much there is for her to do with her voice. They sound beautifully entwined when they sing: whole world is watching us now, it's a little intimidating but since there's no way to calm down, let's give them something amazing.<br /><br />Water & Flame - is Dion's first cover on the album of Daniel Merriweather's 2009 song with additional vocals from Adele. Dion delivers it in a lower registry with a deeper, haskier and sexier tone. A very powerful interpretation.<br /><br />Breakaway - another Play Production is taking Dion's voice into a new territory to travel around the scale accompanied by dramatically growing musical tension. Classical yet very modern Dion.<br/><br />Save Your Soul - another up-tempo track in which Dion sounds very fresh, poppy and super current. Terrific beat and arrangement. Danny Mercer, the guy behind will.i.am and Nicole Scherzinger's hits introduces Dion to the younger generation.<br /><br />Didn't Know Love - another love story but with a new edge to Dion's repertoire; her voice sounds bare and rough when she delivers the words: it's a blessing, it's a curse, you know you've found it when it hurts. It can drive you off a cliff, but it's worth it.<br /><br />Thank you - written by Shaffer Smith aka Ne-Yo, who also sings background on the record. It's a beautifully and delicately delivered THANK YOU message to the one who loved you, because he/she didn't have to...<br /><br />Overjoyed - another duet, this time with Steve Wonder, who released this song originally in 1985. Their voices seem as they were created to sing together in this refreshed version of Wonder's song. Great execution from the production trio: Tricky Stewart, Aaron Pearce and Kuk Harrell.<br /><br />Thankful - is a wonderful classical Dion to words and music by Dana Parish & Andrew Hollander. Simple yet powerful arrangements and soring vocals from Céline, she seems in absolute control of her instrument and a diva-like when accompanied by the choir at the end of the song.<br /><br />At Seventeen - is a cover of Janis Ian's 1975 song which Dion sings during her Céline Show in Las Vegas. It's a reflection song in a new, a slightly Spanish and summery arrangement.<br /><br />Always Be Your Girl - a song written by husband-and-wife song-writing duo Dana Parish and Andrew Hollander. They watched Céline on Oprah's Next Chapter and were so moved and inspired by Dion's personality, that they sat down and penned Always Be Your Girl for her. It's one of the most important songs of Dion's career as it's capturing her real persona. A great ballad.<br /><br />Unfinished Song - is another jewel from Diane Warren who is well known for her extraordinary skills for ballad writing. But this is not a tears squeezer buy yet another up-tempo track on the album. It's a get-up and keep-going kind of song: `cause we're all unfinished songs waiting for the best part to come along. Very positive and truly encouraging tune. Unfinished Song was included on the Song for Marion's soundtrack.<br /><br />How Do You Keep The Music Playing - is Michel Legrand's composition to the lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman for the 1982 film Best Friends. Dion sings this track during her Céline Show in Las Vegas. Although the song has been recorded by many great artists, such as Tony Bennett, George Benson, Frank Sinatra or Barbra Streisand, Dion gives it a new dimension and breaths a new life into it.<br /><br />Lullabye (Goodnight, My Angel) - is a closing track and cover of Billy Joel's from his 1993 album River of Dreams. Beautifully simple and delicate production from Kenny `Babyface' Edmonds.<br /><br />Loved Me Back To Life (UK 11th November 2013)<br />Label: Columbia<br />[...]

Her love to education, loss, friendships, fight for education, moments of joy...it's all there and tell us on what's to be valued in this life. It's the kind of book you want to keep by your bedside, thumbing through it as you drift off to sleep and reading passages on those mornings where it's hard to find the motivation to leap out of bed and seize the day.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This is a 4 for me. This story was very adept at showing you how things have changed over the years and how hard it was for blacks in the south. It would of been a 5 if I didn't get so confused over who was who. What the different laws were and how they played out. That made parts of this read sort of drag a bit for me. This book was a wonderful story of some very decent people trying to do the right thing.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|My boys are ages 10 and 12 years old and they were heartbroken when their first move broke. They were so excited to receive the replacement Transformers dark of the moon they ripped open the package and put it in the DVR right away. Never saw them smile so big before.
0060531053|5.0|This book is great and has a ton of information in it. I love Charlie's style: \\"Relax, have a homebrew\\" is a phrase you'll read often and it reminds you to have fun with all this. This has been my bible for brewing for the past two years. Yes, there are other great books on brewing but Charlie seems to touch on everything and go into detail.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Sometimes a good popcorn novel is exactly what the doctor ordered. No need for a deep plot. I want a decent main character and fun. That's what the Jack Reacher novels are (at least the two I've read so far). They are good, fun, popcorn reads. If you're looking for deep introspection about the lives of ex-military soldiers, look somewhere else.<br /><br />I think this is a good second novel. If you read \\"Killing Floor,\\" you already know most of what you need to about Jack Reacher. You don't find out a whole lot more about him here, and what you do find out isn't all that surprising. The book's main plot picks up quickly and you don't spend a lot of time building up to anything, sure there's some mystery points, but those are revealed over time (as they should be). The main story elements are put into place at the very beginning, and that's what matters.<br /><br />I enjoy reading. I both read books and do audiobooks. I read for learning purposes and for fun. The Jack Reacher novels are fun. Like going to see the action movie that has explosions fun. You know what you're going to get, and that's perfectly okay.

B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I do like this game. I really do. However, when I look back at the game this is a sequel to, this is what I see: more robots, customizable robots, multiplayer that works, etc. None of these show up in this game. The global multiplayer update is supposedly coming soon, and hopefully will fix that, but this is still a sequel that has less than the original. I WANT CUSTOMIZATION!

I've read many books that left me in tears but I still felt like I read a good book that was fulfilling.  But this book just left me mad, depressed and disappointed.  I think Veronia Roth blew it with the ending.....she could have had a series that people would read over and over again and that would look forward to the movies, etc. But not now.....
B008J8KBKY|3.0|Haven't mastered the game yet but love the 3d. Looks great on my kindle hd. Beautifully designed app and free app of the day!!!
B00F3VOL38|4.0|Because The Beatles were releasing 2 albums of music for nearly every year of their career, there aren't any legendary lost recordings, such as The Beach Boys \\"Smile\\" or Dylan's \\"Basement Tapes\\" (the three anthology albums I think prove this).  So the \\"Live at the BBC\\" albums are as close as Beatle fans are going to get to own a fab four version of a \\"Odds & Sods\\" records (you could count the \\"Let it Be\\" sessions I suppose, but that was just the band running through all the 1950's songs they used to perform before they got a record contract).<br />So if you have the first Volume of BBC recording, you will know what to expect here, there are no \\"Why didn't they ever release this song!\\" moments, but a fascinating musical & social time capsule (although there are four interviews recorded at the time of the release of  \\"Rubber Soul\\" & \\"Revolver\\", which sound from a different era).<br />Highlights for me are Chuck Berry's \\"Memphis..\\", tracks from \\"Beatles for Sale\\" (always been my favourite of their mop-top albums), & John trying to create the feed back at the start of  \\"I feel fine\\".<br />So if you're a fan of The Beatles early recording, want to complete your Beatle Back-catalogue, or just want to buy a Beatle album when it was first released (this sounds like it may be the last), then it defiantly worth having.
006226303X|5.0|This was my first experience with a Neil Gaiman book and I loved it. Bought the audio book for myself and a friend. The story is mystical, dark, humorous and poignant. Neil Gaiman is a great reader as well. I recommend this book with 5 stars!
B00GLMQREE|5.0|Great episode! Surprise ending! It's time to leave the prison now, Rick!!! The s*** has hit the fan! I wonder if that herd of walkers Daryl and the gang encountered is coming their way?
B00CN3R2DK|5.0|it's such a really perfect doll which is highly beyond my expectation.<br />and i love it so so so much!!<br />:)
B00G32OER4|4.0|Most horror films are simply horrible films instead.  However, this one was probably one the the best haunted house films I've seen in a while.  There's a good deal of spooky things popping out without a lot of unnecessary gore.  I'd give it 5 stars if they didn't play up the \\"this is a true story\\" nonsense so much, but aside from this pretentiousness, it is a good solid film.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The main reason I bought Google chromecast is to stream audio (google music) from my phone to my receiver. I looked into a  lot of bluetooth audio receivers to wirelessly stream music from my phone or laptop to my receiver {onkyo 809}. I even bought Onkyo UB1 bluetooth accessory for this purpose but it did not work as it only for 2012+ receivers.<br />Looked into Chromecast and it suits me perfectly. I have attached it to my receiver input and works fantastically. No need to worry about steaming(or casting) quality. Youtube also works without any hassles in full HD. Chrome tab casting also works fine.<br />I tried local streaming with plex media server. Good to avoid it as it is very slow with lot of  buffering with 720p video though may work ok with audio. It is better to do local streaming with WDTV or similar device.<br />I think if you know the purpose device serve it works perfectly.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|As a child during the 60s, I remember watching the old silly Japanese monster movies where a couple guys dressed up in corny costumes, be it a giant turtle or rodan or godzilla or a three headed monster or a giant moth or even a giant eyeball.  They would fight each other or even fight a giant robot controlled by some dorky little Japanese kid who was protecting the earth.  This is essentially the same thing with better special effects.  Don't expect much plot but if you want to watch a film about human controlled giant robots fighting goofy looking monsters, you'll probably enjoy the film.  I think I might have enjoyed the film at age 10.  Now, in my 50's, it exceeds my silliness threshold.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I use Wolfram Alpha on my tablets and phone and this is real science fiction. You give an equation and it does integrals, differentiation like a professor. I really wonder how wolfram pulled this off. Ask anything and it will solve. It is better than google for hard questions, scientific and number crunching. Ask natural language questions, math questions. Just awesome. For the price, well worth esp in large tablets.<br /><br />Ok for phone, but really shines in 8 and 10\\" tablets.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great read and sad this book has ended. Really looking forward to the 6th and final book. Thanks George R.R. Martin for opening my eyes to fantasy novels and everything in The Game of Thrones.
B0083Z614S|3.0|My daughter writes this : First of all I want to begin by saying that overall this is an okay book. The content is awesome and thrilling to read. Unfortunately, this book was written when India was in control of Britain. This is where the not so great part comes in. When the main character, Mary Lennox is orphaned she moves to Britain from India.  Martha who later was Mary's servant in Britain confesses that she first thought Mary was an Indian person. It is then when Mary says that Indian people are not people, they are just servants who must salaam to you. This is the part that was very unfair to me. Fortunately, since this book was written during The time when Britain ruled India, and British people had this mindset, I don't think the author did this on purpose. This is an okay book
B0053O89JM|5.0|I have always loved house but this set was for my husbands birthday.. He hates the ending but I love the story line!!
B00985E3UG|5.0|Wow.. I wished I was reading a fiction, but Alas this is hard core non fiction. The marketing engine that companies like Kraft, Pepsi, coca cola runs almost looks evil. The author has explained beautifully how sugar, fat and salt triggers your nervous systems and the side effects of them. Then he walks through how companies engulf us in their myriad advertizing campaigns.  It almost feels surreal and sad innocent people are hooked. I have stopped consuming processed foods unless really required to and has been researching in this area. Some of other books I read prior to this were [[ASIN:0307952207 Finding Ultra: Rejecting Middle Age, Becoming One of the World's Fittest Men, and Discovering Myself]] and [[ASIN:0544002318 Eat and Run: My Unlikely Journey to Ultramarathon Greatness]], both aiming at the greatness of vegan diet.<br /><br />I was flabbergasted at the amount of sugar the companies are adding to children's drinks, and fat they put on cookies etc. The list is endless. Only way to get back to healthy habits are going back 75 years before this processed industry took root in large numbers post world war 2. Fresh fruits/veggies/exercise will get us back to form and fitness eradicating heart disease, diabetics, and cancer. This is a overall summary of the book!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Love this collection. Cannot beat the price. The discs play great in our Blu Ray Player. The first DVD is titled The Philosphers Stone, instead of The Sorcerer's Stone. The collection comes with an explaination for it, and even in the movie I believe Harry Potter says the words &#34;The Philosphers Stone.&#34; Definitely recommend buying this collection.
1401238580|5.0|Received mine yesterday and it was in perfect condition.  The book is what I was mainly after, but couldn't resist the opportunity to have the mask with it as well.  It makes for a great display box with the mask featured prominently.  I had heard a lot of bad things on here about this set, but I got more than what I paid for with this item!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|play this game often with different people, would highly recomend this game to anybody whom enjoys playing any type of game.
B000QUUD60|5.0|This is definitely Elvis at his very best.  He was sick of the fluffy movie rolls and had a new energy after his hugely successful '68 comeback special.  He was fit and looked better than ever.  His charisma oozed out with such ease and the live performances captured here are awesome.  It just proved over and over again why Elvis is the undisputed &#34;King Of Rock N Roll&#34;.  We get to see his magic on stage and here his unbelievable beautiful voice.  This shows it all for Elvis, including his wonderful sense of humor.  This is a must have for every Elvis fan and music lover.  You get the re-edited and enhanced version that was done in 2001 and also the original from 1970.  The new version centers more on Elvis, which I like, where the original '70 version includes fan video.
B00G118LYY|5.0|My 6 and 4 year old fight over the game. It is very simp,e and basic and personally I did not think it would keep their attention, but it does.
B00G25VQFA|5.0|Just have to agree - this is his best album yet. The \\"Moon Landing\\" motif is portrayed in every song--as a college-trained musician myself, I appreciate how difficult a task this is. Composition, piano, voice, message, story--all beautifully combined, but what else can we expect from Blunt. Don't expect anything new--he is not reinventing pop with \\"Moon Landing\\"--you'll just get the Blunt-style music we've come to know and it doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />You either love him or love to hate him--this is why he's so popular!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book because I enjoyed the first in the trilogy.  Once you get involved with the main characters struggle, you have to find out her future.<br />The author does it again in this book.  Can't wait to turn the pages of the final book and find out  how Katniss fights the corrupt Capitol.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is the best if you like challenges each board is different and gets more complicated as you advance.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|Phenomenal!  Elton is awesome with his clarity of purpose, both musically and vocally.  Bernie never fails with lyrics, and as he ages, he is a world wonder of contemplation.  Love the boys.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|Received both DVD and Blu-ray discs.  Case and discs were in good shape.  When I played both from start to finish the sound varied throughout both versions.  Had to keep turning the sound up or down.  No skipping and good picture quality.  Only problem was the sound variations.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|Very nice and necessary lens.  Since I am addicted to Canon products, this is no exception.  The lens is great-highly recommended!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have used it for a couple of weeks now. It works perfectly. And I didn't even need the extension that came with Chromecast.
B000QE9ERK|1.0|When the technical aspects of the film negatively impact my enjoyment of a movie it's because they're so bad, the story and acting aren't compelling enough or both. In this case I think it was mainly due to lighting, music, camera work and direction.<br /><br />It feels outdated (not vintage, classic or even retro) as if Polanski hasn't seen any films made in the last few decades before making this and hasn't grown as a film maker like a game developer continuing to build titles for the C64.<br /><br />It's flat and detracts from the story which could have been compelling and had a good cast. If only they had been captured in a way that had some sort of impact. There were these awkward pauses in the editing that ruined the flow as well as a few cut scenes that made little sense.<br /><br />The movie poster reflects the appropriate tone, the actual film made me feel like I was watching a Get Smart episode. I was going to stop watching it but kept going through to the end because I was wondering if I'd see some signs that it was meant to be a parody of the genre but that never happened.<br /><br />I didn't find it the least bit suspenseful, thrilling or entertaining. It just felt uncomfortable to watch. Such a great waste of some talented actors. I should have passed on watching it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very addictive I particularly like the blocks and pipes games. It's the only game I have ever purchased things for. I wish it would recharge quicker.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Awesome microphone for the price!  We use it for church band.  It delivers as well as the Shure mics.  Crisp clear sound.
B004KPLVYU|4.0|Another Johnny Depp movie  nothing more really needs to be said another old movie with a new twist and a great actor putting his touch on it
B0000025D0|5.0|You don't often see this. Usually when an artist posts that masterpiece release, the critics hail it to the heavens, but the fans consider it a dud. I don't believe I've ever seen reviews from the fans that consitently praise a magnificent album in the manner in which this production has been received. It actually holds a special place for me, because I was from the same area and era, and the man was a well known part of the whole Jersey Shore scene. My '69 Firebird was sprung from it's cage and roared down Highway 9 on a regular basis.<br /><br /> Here's where I draw a unique parallel. He had dreamed of escaping all the stuff he used to sing about, and he succeeded. The rest of us, were going to go on to live the life he so perfectly describes throughout this album. He went on to become a mega star, but I listened to that \\"Factory\\" whistle blow for 5 years while drudging my way through '... the work, the work, just the working life'. I always dreamed that Lisa would meet me at '.. a spot 'neath Abrahm's Bridge' in the \\"Darkness On The Edge of Town\\". Maybe '..she's waiting for me out in the parking lot, of the 7-11 store', and we colud do some 'Racin' In The Streets'. I guess all of our 'pretty little dreams are torn'. Did I mention that the man is a master lyricist?<br /><br /> Let's put this back on target! I read a few reviews that claim this might be the greatest rock album of all time, and I gotta say that I would never venture out that far. But if you ask me how many stars it gets, the number five is going to come out of my mouth without hesitation! By far, my favorite Springsteen album, and probaly the pinnacle of his life and his career.<br /><br />I should add this point. Many people are complaining about the quality of the recording itself. I only bought this as a 'hard copy' backup in my library. I listen to a CD that I cut on audio equipment, using a turntable with a magnetic cartridge, from a pristine vinyl copy, so I get top-notch sound out of mine.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|a really fine story plenty for twists and turns in the plot and a great cast of actors who are good at there craft and did the movie right
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Great puzzle app.  Something you can enjoy during TV commercials or while you wait at an appointment.  Not too hard on a tired brain.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My five year old has a very short attention span.  I can open this game for her and she is still and quiet for hours.  She loves being able to play a different game whenever she wants.  I love it for car trips, eating out and rainy days!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Waiting time in-between games<br /><br />The waiting time between games is too frustrating.  When you are playing the game you don't have all day.  You want to keep going
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The hints are on point and just takes seconds to re boot. The HO's are excellent in with me there is always one I have trouble finding. I like the storyline and so far no glitches with my kindle fire. LOVE THIS GAME ,KEEP Them coming big fish
B007FJFDXS|2.0|Edge Extended is a physics puzzle maze game.  You move a block around an area trying to guide it to collectibles and finally the goal.  Edge is a pleasant surprise. I found the game to hold very little challenge with only a decent replay value.  The graphics are good with classic style on the menus, but the color scheme is drab.  Touch response is acceptable, but movement is often erratic.  You can manipulate the screen to view unseen portions, though this never served a purpose for me.  Music and sound is clear, but doesn't compliment atmosphere for me.  The game functioned properly on my Kindle Fire, with no force closing or hang ups.  In the end, the game functions well aside from sporadic loss of control over your cube, but doesn't deliver anywhere else.  Every pro has a con to counter it, making this game a 2 star at best for me, especially when coming with a $3 price tag.  I recommend it for age 8+ hardcore fans of physics puzzles, looking for something different, if not polished.  For a free game or even a dollar I would have been more lenient.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|transferred tapes to computer with qualityable to see sound as transferred and trancfer to disk was easy.  thought I would loose all my cassettes since players eat them up
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I'm not much of a Lady Gaga fan but I'm loving this album, ever since I heard her first single Applause(which is very catchy) I decided to give it a try. The album has a variety of songs for different tastes whether you want a soothing song to a sexual/party song you'll find it within this album. I highly recommend it
B00DJUPLY8|3.0|This program has a lot of good features, but it tended to skip and freeze while my daughter watched her movies on her Kindle.  When we switched to a different movie player, the skipping stopped.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this is Ann awe some game I love it so much I hope u get it it is the best game ever
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just can't stop playing it. Only bad thing about the game is how addictive it is. It's a great game any time of the day and playing it with Facebook is awesome because  I  turns really competitive with your friends
B0094BB4TW|3.0|GLITCHES WHEN OPENING SOMETIMES.  Other than that it is a good alternate to using my phone.  Easier for the kids to use rather than the laptop.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I bought this CD after  a vacation in Hawaii.  It really didn't show that much of the island but it was an OK movie.  Not one of Clooney's best!
B0089LOG02|4.0|It was a good read.  Touched on an aspect of American history of which I had no knowledge.  Found myself rooting for both heroines.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Always like the Extended versions of movies I buy, more bang for the buck. But I am really sick and tired of this Ultraviolet stuff. 'Not Compatible With Itunes', blah blah blah---come on people, do you have to offer what no Mac user wants. Itunes is even used by many PCs, there is a version for those computers. Give us back the 'Digital' option made for Itunes, we pay enough for the product and should get it, or have BOTH options I should think. And about Flixster, what a pain that is. You go to the Ultraviolet site to get your digital copy only to find yourself re-directed to Flixster where you have to jump thru hoops and create an account there. You can't even stream the stuff if you don't have a 1080p display, it won't let you. The 'click on SD' option when the streaming starts doesn't even work, the streaming still won't play on a 720p diaplay. You need to actually 'download' the whole movie, which will then only play with the Flixster player that you have to download too, which has almost no screen adjustment options when compared to the many Itunes player screen options. That means taking up space on the hard drive with yet another copy of the film, which was the thing to avoid to begin with. I don't intend to buy another tv/monitor to replace my 720p tv just to play Flixster streaming videos occasionally. The old digital copies were just fine for my 720p secondary tv.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|What a fabulous game! I cannot believe it is free! I totally recommend ditto anyone who hunts or just likes to shoot things. Easy to keep enough money to purchase upgrades! will keep this oneforna long time to come!
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Ok, first of all, I have a zombie phobia.  I quit watching all zombie media about 5 years ago, because I would have really bad dreams about zombies afterward.  My daughter told me that this might be one I could actually watch without being bothered, and BOY, was she right!  Paid 99 cents to rent this, so I'm not upset.<br /><br />MINOR spoilers ahead.  I am really shocked that so many people liked this movie - especially all those saying this was \\"fun.\\"  There was nothing \\"fun\\" about this.  It alternated between boring and ludicrous, with nothing much else in between.  I gave it 2 stars because it's not the worst thing I've ever seen.  Brad Pitt wasn't terrible, but he seemed tired and lacked any believable intensity in the situation he was in.  I still don't have any idea who he really was or why he was needed on the \\"mission\\" to...what?  Find out where the zombie disease came from, I think.  And I know he worked for the UN, but again, no idea why they needed him in particular.<br /><br />The story in general was pretty ridiculous.  I mean, I'm sure you have to suspend disbelief in general to believe in zombies at all, but nothing here was believable or logical.  The worst part was that Jerry sees two - literally TWO - people who the zombies don't attack and then figures out how to save the day.  And when he tests out his theory - OMFG.  I'd love to spoil the ending for you, but I won't.  But it's just absolute utter nonsense.  He does something absurd and 2 minutes later...boom.  Day saved.  Ridiculous, if you know anything about science at all.<br /><br />If you're bored and have nothing better to do and this is still a cheap rental, sure watch it.  And maybe you'll be like one of the folks here who thought this was the best thing ever created.  But don't hold your breath.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice simple game that can be played offline. I like that the choices and settings are minimal. I use this game when I am off the grid but need a little electronic boredom to get to sleep.
0761129235|2.0|I was sorely disappointed by this book. 99% of the text is anecdotal and the author repeats himself A LOT. I assume its to bolster the page-count. Kaizen is such a simple concept that it doesn't require a book to be understood. For these reasons I really can't recommend buying this title.
1927628091|5.0|There seems to be so little real science fiction out there. Fantasy is everywhere, and I don't love fantasy. Lots of space operas, too. But real and REALISTIC science fiction seems to be very rare. This is that rare gem. I loved it!! There are no love stories or evil adversaries or creepy aliens. There is no mysticism or magic. The science was real. The logic was real. And most surprising of all, the humor was incredible!  If only I could find more books like this...
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It was okay it was not the best ever. But I liked it it was so-so like in the middle of okay
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The book kept a good pace throughout. There were some interesting turns in the story line that were not predictable. It is unusual for me to read a novel and not find an error. This one was very well written. I will likely read another Landay novel soon.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|I wish dramas such as Broadchurch was available in the U.S. The series is intelligent, good paced, and has fantastic acting. Wow!
B00BG4RLF6|3.0|I was really looking forward to listening to this - I'd read the reviews and knew that Blake had won some significant accolades for the CD in the UK. Maybe it's just not what I was expecting or my expectations were too high, but none of the songs really grabbed me. One or two have a repeating refrain that gets flat irritating after awhile. I've been listening to the new Avicii (&#34;True&#34;) CD for a few weeks now and I can play that all the way through and enjoy every song. Maybe this CD is just suffering by comparison.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A+ Product  from Google . I like it that very useful . One of the most product useful form google
B004XQO90O|5.0|WOW!  I'm not sure if the movie or the person who came up with the idea for it deserves the five stars.  Probably, both!  What a concept.  What an imagination!!  Honestly, you can't go wrong watching this movie.  The idea of replaying events has been done before, but never quite like this. It began causing me to question what was going on.  But once it takes off, which is quite early in the game, it REALLY takes off.  Sit back, hold on and prepare yourself for Lift Off!!  BTW, I think they wrote the ending to give you time to recompose yourself and catch your breath.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A spectacular book, teaching about a totally foreign and unknown world (North Korea), while telling a story and developing the character of the hero and protagonist.  It provides views form both sides, gives one an understanding of living under a despot, who is not benign.  It makes one contemplate what humans do in such circumstances, and rings true.
B00001OH1S|4.0|This CD renders beautifully the sophistication and elegance of the 1999 remake of the sixties classic with Pierce Brosnan as blasé millionaire turned thief. The score by Bill Conti is sexy, classy and cool.
B004GYY714|5.0|Lots of content.  I use it mostly to listen to podcasts, but you can find all kinds of music and listen whenever you want to.
B00BSN0K1C|4.0|Beautiful rendition of the Man of Steel from the Zack Snyder movie. Nice paint job, many points of articulation, sturdy. I highly recommend it to all Superman fans and to super-heros enthusiasts in general.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The ending of the book was incredible and beautiful, I loved the epilogue, but as a conclusion to the divergent series it was absolutely devastating! It just ruined the series for me. What I don't understand is that if Tris is so powerful concerning her divergencey to withstand the death serum, which is incredibly special, why can't she with stand a couple bullets? I think had she been badly injured instead of killed it could have made a better conclusion because the it would have shown that love conquerors all. So, if you loved the Tris and Tobias relationship in divergent and insurgent I suggest that you make up your own happy ending.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like others, I wish there were more levels!  Definitely a creative game where you are trying to find the clues to open the doors.  I was disappointed when I realized I had reached the end!
B00000DWHG|5.0|I've been listening to the remastered version for years and decided to track down the original. I'm very happy that I did, because it really brings back memories of hearing this for the first time nearly 34 years ago. This original mix is warmer and fuller than the remastered version, which was remixed and both added and removed elements from the original mix.<br /><br />I ordered this from Wild Willie's and the condition was even better than was expected. Highly recommended.
B00BWQW73E|5.0|Just as a story by itself, The Everything Store is a very good read; if you add the lessons you learn from the way Bezos has crafted Amazon, it makes it an amazing book that will be enjoyed not only by .com fans but also entrepreneurs and business people in all business sectors.
B00CUKTGW6|5.0|I've long collected The Clash on CD and owned the original Epic releases from the late eighties, which had little to no packaging and suffered from uneven sound quality. The vinyl re-pressings that I owned sounded better, but still did not include the inserts that were included with the originals. I'm happy to say that this collection has filled in the gaps as the presentation, packaging, and sound quality are all superb. Everything is present — label art, posters, lyrics, inner sleeves, even the photo insert in Combat Rock.<br /><br />All audio has been restored as well, so Koka Kola and Innoculated City both appear as in the original releases. The audio has not had the life compressed out of it and remains dynamic while being just a tiny bit louder than the original CD releases.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|I have watched every season of Supernatural.  I hope it continues.  I like the actors and each week something weird or it could be funny will take place.  The whole cast is outstanding.  I'm buying all of the Supernatural seasons so when they do stop I can watch all of them all over again.  I have an 18 year old granddaughter who visits me every week and we watch Supernatural together.  My granddaughter has a crush on Dean Winchester.  I may be old, but he is easy on the eyes.  I look forward to Supernatural and my granddaughter's visit every week.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I liked the book but the ending was just horrible. The story wasn't complete and I spent all night wondering why an ending like that would come out of an amazing series like this. The ending just left you empty, confused, and angry at the same time. I'm a little disappointed on how this book turned out, but it's still an good book to read and I enjoyed it.
B004SKQAJI|1.0|I am a fan of Michael Flatley's &#34;Feet of Flames&#34; DVD and have gone to see &#34;Lord of the Dance&#34; live when it came to town.  I was excited to see that he did another performance DVD 10 years later and was hoping for something similar.  He basically stripped the show down to the group dances.  He eliminated the Irish singing.  The little spirit character was dressed like a court jester and his live musical performance with the other musicians just was not as good this time.  The show just failed overall.  The dancing was the same skillful performance, but I was struck by the change in the spirit of the show.  The ladies' costume changes were less of the Irish tradition, more revealing and immodest -- It is just not family friendly and it seems to just elevate lust rather than the good triumphing over evil as the original show attempted to do.  We enjoy the dancing for the sake of the talent and art and the healthy message of the original show; not for the sex appeal that Michael seems to think is now necessary.  The story became more of a parody of the original idea for the show.  Riverdance live in NY and Michael's &#34;Feet of Flames&#34; were superior and more worth the time if you are looking for outstanding Irish dancing for the family.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|This album certainly is not the greatest album ever or the \\"album of the millennium\\".<br /><br />First off, the title is completely irrelevant. I hear the pop. It's not great pop, but it is pop. But there is no art. If she wanted to make a strange compound word describing the album without it being negative (because she wouldn't name it TERRIBLEPOP), it should be called SEXPOP. Because that is what it is. Combining these two things. There is no art.<br />Now, I know what you will say. \\"My artpop could mean anything.\\" from the title track. It could mean anything, but in this case it means nothing really. There is nothing even really art related.<br /><br />I do not listen to all of Gaga's stuff, usually only the singles, so maybe this is how her other songs sound. But this is not what I really wanted.<br /><br />Now, there are a few stand-outs that prevent it from being terrible. These would be:<br />Applause<br />Do What U Want<br />Venus<br />Dope<br />G.U.Y<br />Gypsy<br />6/15 of the songs are good. The rest almost made me want to tear out my ears. According to my calculator, that means 4/10 of the songs are good, or 2/5. Just download those few. If you really want to buy the whole album, I recommend not listening to these sings because they TORTURED me:<br />Aura<br />X Dreams<br />MANiCURE<br />Jewels N' Drugs<br />If you already bought the promotional songs, just download G.U.Y and Gypsy, those are the only other good songs.<br /><br />By no means is this the worst album of the year. That credit would have to go to BANGERZ. But this album is not great, at all.<br /><br />Aura: 1/10, at least some of it is catchy, right?<br />Venus: 10/10, probably the best cut off this album.<br />G.U.Y: 9/10, so incredibly catchy!<br />X Dreams: 0/10, easily the worst song off the album.<br />Jewels N' Drugs: 1/10. Belch.<br />MANiCURE: 2/10, too bad her catchy chorus couldn't save it from: \\"PUT! SOME! LIPSTICK ON!\\"<br />DO What U Want: 8/10, not the most impressive Gaga part, but R. Kelly saves it all.<br />Artpop: 3/10, how catchy it is spares it from being a total train-wreck.<br />Swine: 5/10, eh.<br />Donatella: 5/10, see Swine.<br />Fashion!: 5/10, see Donatella.<br />Mary Jane Holland: 5/10, see Fashion!.<br />Dope: 9.5/10. One of the best ballads of the year.<br />Gypsy: 8.5/10, fun.<br />Applause: 10/10. you've heard it, it's just awesome.<br />Overall: 5.7/10. Yes, I know that that would equal around a 3/5 so my review absolutely has to be all wrong. But all the other things I have said factor in.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a very impressive album. Just get those 6 songs and you will be happy.<br /><br />P.S: I can see the future....people are going to yell at me for having a negative opinion of this album.......
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I fully enjoyed this story.  The usual far fetched King magic that is always entertaining.  An easy read that I found hard to put down.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Great serious, I can't wait for season 8 to arrive.  Nice to be able to watch the season from start to finish!
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|Adapting Shakespeare for inclusion in a modern day setting isn't new.  Even when the original arcane dialog is used.  Director Joss Whedon taking a 12 day break from the still to be concluded \\"The Avengers,\\" gathers some of his old gang and sets up shop in his house to deliver this popular romantic comedy.<br /><br />For those new to this language, it will definitely seem odd and take a while to get used to.  Especially when adapted to current times.  Shot in beautiful black and white, the story centers around a couple love stories.  One of the oddities in the play is that people fall in love quickly and want to get married even quicker.  Single parent Leonato (Clark Gregg) has only a virginal daughter, Hero (Jillian Morgese) but also acts as a father figure for his niece Beatrice (Amy Acker) who has certainly seen her share of amorous activity.  Both attractive ladies would seem to be prime marriage material for family and friends of nobleman Don Pedro (Reed Diamond).<br /><br />Kinsman Claudio (Fran Kranz) quickly falls for Hero.  Benedick (Alexis Denisof) and Beatrice bicker at each other constantly, but underneath there is an obvious attraction.  The houseguests and the occupants play some trickery to get the couples together.  It works.  Hero and Claudio are set to be married the next day.<br /><br />Throwing a monkey wrench into the plans, is Don Pedro's disgraced brother, Don John who is in tow with a couple of his friends.  Don John decides to play an evil trick on everyone by having one of his buddies have sex with one of the maids who would be disguised as Hero.  He would then lure Claudio and Don Pedro outside to view the couple copulating by an exposed window.<br /><br />An inept constable, Dogberry (Nathan Fillion) and a pair of bumbling deputies come to the rescue having overheard the plot after it took place.  The film's pacing is quick enough to make you forget the disconnect between the centuries of origin and present day.  The acting itself is first rate and after a while you just settle in with the cadence of the language.  Frivolous and fun.t rate and after a while you just settle in with the cadence of the language.  Frivolous and fun.
B00CY3SEN6|4.0|How does one write a book that has geek-appeal as well as general public appeal?  I mean, the goal is to sell lots of books, right?  On the surface, Mark's previous book, Zero Day, seemed more focused on the former; Trojan Horse, on the latter.  Trojan Horse was more oriented around the relationship between the two main characters, Zero Day, less so.  My not-geek wife would enjoy Trojan Horse more, I think.<br /><br />Trojan Horse did not seem to rely as much on the reader's technical knowledge.  For those into the cyber-security of SCADA control systems, you'll likely wish there'd been more technical details of the vulnerabilities.  Never-the-less, this worth reading. If I had not read Zero Day first, there would be no basis for comparison.  So if you haven't read Zero Day, read Trojan Horse first.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy the game, the music &amp; the silliness<br />It is good clean fun.  The story lines are simple and easy to follow
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Simply put: Man of Steel was freaking awesome. I have been waiting for this type of Superman movie for longer than I can remember.  The original Superman movie was a good flick for its time, and Christopher Reeves did a masterful job of making us believe Superman could hide his identity behind the façade of a bumbling Clark Kent. But I'm not ashamed to admit I am from a generation that loves spectacular action and special effects, and I have been craving a Superman movie that really taps into the modern day potential of movie magic, with an equally engaging storyline and characters. Man of Steel delivers in spades.<br /><br />I don't give this praise lightly. I had serious reservations and doubts about this movie going into the theater. The bitter taste of Superman Returns was still fresh in my memory. I know the critics have been espousing that the former movie was better than people gave it credit for, that it actually got better reviews, etc.  Maybe Superman Returns wasn't a bad movie, but it certainly wasn't a good movie either. At best it was a \\"blah\\" movie, and for a Superman movie that just won't cut it. Superman never even throws a punch in the movie. In fact he gets his ass kicked by a couple of thugs while under the influence of kryptonite. In fact the biggest \\"super\\" feat in the movie was lifting a big rock, incongruously while under the influence of the same kryptonite that allowed the thugs to beat him nearly to death. In contrast, Man of Steel has some serious throwdowns with other Kryptonians. Even the super lifting feat included in this movie, holding up a collapsing oil rig tower, is a heck of a lot cooler than slowly lifting a big rock into space.<br /><br />My reservations about Man of Steel continued in the early days of the production as news trickled out. Nolan and Goyer became involved, and though they did a spectacular job with the first two installments of their Batman series, I was skeptical about their suitability for the Superman franchise. How would their dedication to ultra-realism translate to a story about a man who can bench press mountains and fly through space? Furthermore, in my opinion the last installment of their take on the Batman mythos strayed way off course, compounding my doubts. We soon learned that Zod would be the major antagonist of the new movie, and while I was encouraged that Superman would have a real superhuman opponent, I feared we would get another poor copy of the original movies, just as Superman Returns came across as a poorly plagiarized version of the original. The earliest trailers for the new movie didn't help either. They seemed to suggest a long drawn out discovery process, devoid of the Superman action sequences I was craving. The most exciting thing they showed in the original trailer was Superman flying. We've been there, done that.<br /><br />Subsequent trailers offered more promise, though they still didn't show a lot. I guess they were using the old trick of the strip tease, show us just enough to get us interested. In hindsight I'm glad they didn't show or reveal more, because every moment of the movie was a treat, unspoiled by over divulging trailers prior to release. I often despair when I have to sit through another origin story for these comic books icons that I know so well. I'm anxious to get to the good stuff. But Man of Steel managed to make the new origins fresh and interesting, and extremely relevant to the overall story.<br /><br />And holy crap did they nail the casting of the new Superman. Henry Cavill's Superman makes previous movie renditions of the character look like guys playing Halloween dress-up. This guy looks like he could bend steel, even without the movie magic. The acting was solid all the way around. Superman came across as caring, complicated, and heroic. Lois Lane was likable, smart, and had a real adventurous spirit, and loads of integrity. You could easily see why Superman would fall for this mortal woman. Contrast that with super-bitchy Lois from Superman Returns. Is it any wonder he decided to leave the planet for five years?<br /><br />Some critics have argued that this Superman is too violent and not true to the character. These people obviously don't know much about the character. Most of Superman's stories (comic books, animated series, original Superman movies) involve violent conflicts with other superhuman opponents. Do they really think we want another movie where Superman battles the elements and catches falling airplanes.<br /><br />So to summarize, why is Man of Steel the best superman movie ever:<br /><br />  1. Awesome action that makes great use of the environment (smashing buildings to pieces, mega explosions).<br />  2. Intense superhuman versus superhuman combat (can you say using a train as a weapon -  gives new meaning to more powerful than a locomotive).<br />  3. A villain with a goal that makes sense (unlike Lex Luthor from Superman Returns, who thought an ugly chunk of black crystal/rock would make for prime real estate).<br />  4. A Superman that looks the part (I am very much a straight man - but even I had to think DAMN when I saw Henry Cavill as Superman, and sans shirt in a particular scene).<br />  5. A Superman who embraces his role as humanity's protector (I loved Smallville, but Clark's crying about being different could be tiresome in the early seasons - come on you can run faster than the speed of sound and juggle tractors - yeah, sucks to be you. Not to mention being able to see into the girl's locker room).<br />  6. Lois Lane is no dummy (A pair of glasses were never going to fool this girl).<br />  7. No more camp (Man of Steel has it's humorous moments, without resorting to the type of campy antics that were pervasive throughout Superman Returns).<br /><br />In summary, Man of Steel is the Superman movie I have been waiting for since I first fell in love with the character. I can't wait to see where they take us next.

B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|pretty disappointed as a fan (and I'm not the only one). I used to listen to her cd's and even went to one of her concerts, which was pretty good. This cd is not even listenable. Most songs sound like she took them out of a trashbin full of the worst of the 80's music. She's even out of tune in \\"dope\\" and so busy yelling to display her \\"talents\\" that she does not even notices. This album is definitely going to be a success , not because its good, but because her \\"monsters\\" as she calls them will buy it massively to support her despite the critics. good on them if they can stand such a crap just to keep being members of the \\"family\\" of monsters. That's what brainwashing does after all.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I am stunned by this recording.<br />It has to be the most true to form recording of any 80's band out there.<br />Whenever an old band makes a recording nowadays it's fraught with a couple of issues.<br />Usually (almost always) the singers voice has degrade - sometimes a LOT.<br />The bands lacks energy, and sounds dull and uninspired.<br />The band tries too hard to add modern production, or worse yet - uses it to cover up for the bands degraded talents.<br />The production is flat, and the sound isn't big.<br /><br />None of these issues, NONE of them are present on this recording.<br />First off, Michael Sweats voice is off the charts phenomenal.<br />I'm an atheist, and if I didn't know better - I'd swear he had celestial help.<br />Simply amazing.<br />No degradation at ALL, to the point that you would swear that Michael recorded this some twenty plus years ago - and it was hidden away.<br />Amazing.<br />The entire band plays it like they mean it hard, fast, tight, aggressive, driven and driving.<br />Robert Sweats drumming rocks like only he can.<br /><br />The songs are great as well.<br />Right away, I had favorites and was singing them in my head or going directly to the tracks.<br /><br />Great work Stryper!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|AWESOME! I loved how Abra was introduced and her character as a whole. Very cool. Like Charlie in Firestarter, I just love how Steven King gives such power and strength to the children in his stories. Now I need to back track and dig into Shining.
B00BATG18K|1.0|So disappointing, I am a fan of Amy Tan writing but I can't believe she actually wrote this one nor that the publisher actually sent it  out. Sorry about the one star but this reads like a first effort and not a good one at that.The story is an old one and much better told by other writers. Can't recommend this one and sorry I wasted my time and money.one star for managing to get the publisher to buy it.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Perhaps this isn't for me, but as a young 30 something the characters, storyline, and imagined world never gripped me and I felt like the book could have been 20 pages instead of 200 (or however long it was). Just ok from my perspective.

B00AEFY3MC|5.0|It's fitting that one of the funniest satires on space travel films should include in its cast the award-winning star of one of the best of the space-ship serious epics, Alien. That, of course, is Sigourney Weaver, who looks very good in this one despite being pretty far from a young woman in the first bloom of youth. In fact, everyone associated with the film looks good, or at least acts good, in this funny and even somewhat touching movie. One need not be a space junkie to get a kick out of it. One needs only to like a good laugh, a good natured laugh, at one of the most popular genre of  popular entertainment. Nothing in it to prevent it from being a movie of choice for the whole family (save, of course, the littlest among us who might be frightened by the action.)

B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|I gave this album three stars because of a few things.<br /><br />Artpop is not as good as any of her other albums. The Fame was, by far, the BEST album that she's put out yet. She did have less creative control on The Fame...maybe that's why it was so good - not that I don't think think that she's not an artist, I just think that her record label lets her wild ideas run her music and \\"presto\\" we get Artpop. They really should pull back the reins on some of her creative control, so that she stops going off the deep end so much.<br /><br />If you listen really closely, you'll realize that this album is basically revolving around her. I find it to be very narcissistic with her throwing occasional lyrics at the fact that she's so rich and has all this money. Really?<br /><br />Some of the lyrics were lacking and empty. Some of the songs I couldn't even bear to listen to all the way through because they were just bad. Sorry, Gaga.<br /><br />It seemed in some of the songs that she was trying to emulate Christina Aguilera's style of singing. I wish artists would stop trying to copy each other and just do their own thing. She may, or may not, have realized that she was doing this; but my ears screamed \\"Christina Aquilera\\" when I listened to \\"Do What U Want\\".<br /><br />So, with all that being said...I did enjoy the songs \\"Venus\\", \\"Swine\\", and \\"Applause\\". They were the only ones that got replayed quite a few times.<br /><br />The hype of this album was more than what was delivered.
0060873175|2.0|This is a poor excuse for a Michael Crichton book. I'm not sure whether Crichton or Preston deserves more of the blame, but it reads like a tired and formulaic combination of Jurassic Park and Honey I Shrunk the Kids. The premise is so similar to Jurassic Park that it's kind of embarrassing this book was created in the first place. The main group of characters is laughably contrived. There's the venom expert! The insect behavior expert! The plant expert! Each one will be called upon exactly once to use his unique knowledge to the save the group! It felt like the kids in Captain Planet. Additionally, the villain is an over-the-top psychopath and not at all believable. Neither was the science. As a children's book this might be passable, were it not for the violence.<br /><br />If you're looking for scary battles between humans and giant insects, read this book. If you're looking for something with a believable plot and compelling characters, don't read this book. It is not in the same ballpark as Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Congo, or Sphere.

B00CLMA3HK|4.0|If you are a fan of science fiction such as Doctor Who, Stargate Atlantis and other book and movie franchises (namely Indiana Jones and the x-files), then you will find this novel incredibly exciting. As I plunged strait into the story I found myself lost within a world of alien invasion, apocalypse action and scarily scintillating adventure. This book is extremely fast-paced and so it did not take me long (merely a few hours) to read from page one to the end. I found the conspiracy theories and original locations utterly fascinating, hence I am intrigued as to where this story will go in the next instalment and sequel.<br /><br />The Aurora conspiracy contains a colourful cast of characters, most memorable of which is Jesse, who's a descendant from an alien that crashed into her family's windmill in 1897. Jesse embarks on a journey to find her mother who disappeared into the same windmill ten years ago. After she discovers the key to reopen the portal, she travels through some of the most mysterious places in the universe including: the Bermuda Triangle, the Pyramids of Giza, Planet Erebus and Atlantis ... and time.<br /><br />I loved how the author merges together elements of steampunk, fantasy fiction and sci-fi so as to produce something totally unique and like nothing I don't think you would find upon a bookshelf to quite equal it. Well-written, exciting and dynamic the roller coaster of a ride that this novel takes you on is one that will delight a wide-range of reader.<br /><br />*The only negative was that there was little description and background history to the characters and events within the book, therefore making it much shorter than I feelt the story could have been. It needs `fleshing out a bit' so as to make you feel even more a part of the bigger picture, whereas when I read I felt it somewhat rushed in introductions to characters and brief encounters with other worlds. The author could have taken a tip from classic high/epic fantasy and explored about stretching the storyline even further, so that it was not such a quick read.*<br /><br />Fans of Doctor Who and one of my favourite films National Treasure will simply love this story! Anyone looking to take a trip to infinity and beyond should definitely not hesitate in picking this book off the shelf.<br /><br />*I won a copy of Ginger Gelsheimer's novel \\"The Aurora Conspiracy: the story that didn't end with a crash...the epic journey began!\\" through a Goodreads, first-read giveaway*<br /><br />4.5 starsbout stretching the storyline even further, so that it was not such a quick read.*<br /><br />Fans of Doctor Who and one of my favourite films National Treasure will simply love this story!

B000209ZAE|4.0|OK, so I finally took it out of the box.  I had bought an adapter to adapt a Dremel 4000 to this drill press because the Dremel drill press was a toy.  The adapter costs nearly half of the press.  My adapter replaces the yellow bracket.  Others, use a collar.  The company in Australia that I bought the adapter from doesn't have it anymore.  But there are others that slip on the threads and make the Dremel Proxxon clampable.<br /><br />Reviews also say the Dremel tool is a joke compared to the Proxxon tool as well and I agree.  I have a lot invested in Dremel attachments, but I could not justify the Dremel drill press.<br /><br />With my adapter, you cannot use the right angle attachment of the Dremel, but I can rotate the chuck.  Probably could if you were able to ream another clamp to 0.875 or 0.876.<br /><br />OK, no instructions.  No big deal.  But why 3 sizes of hex wrenches and why not some sort of plastic widget that could sit on top of the post and hold them. Surely the front and the bed could use the same screw.<br /><br />The spring doesn't quite return the quill even with nothing on it. Grease and polishing should fix that. The clamps need two O-rings on them, so they don't get in the way when the quill is set low.<br /><br />So, lets check the \\"clamp\\" or is it a fence.  I suppose it's more of a fence.  Well, guess what, you can't use the fence in two places where the ribs are. That was EXACTLY where I wanted to put it.  Used a combination square to square it up.  The vise must be a necessity.  Not sure how to clamp a piece of flat stock yet.  A miniature staircase clamp would be cool.  T-nuts would have been cool.  The fence screw should have a hex socket in it and the ribs should be cut a little deeper.<br /><br />Now, since I wanted to cut rather than drill. I found out there is NO WAY to lock the quill.  The screw that looks like a quill lock doesn't work.  That would be an adjustment for play.  The removed \\"L Proxxon Mount\\" to the rescue.  It can be placed at the bottom of the Quill to effectively lock it.<br /><br />A quill lock is essential when you want to drill a precise hole: You center the drill, lock the quill, clamp and drill.  That doesn't work here.  Hey, I used a precision drill press before and this isn't one of them.<br /><br />The scale didn't last the first use.<br /><br />I didn't know about the MB200 which looks like it can drill holes on an angle, but I would need a different Dremel adapter.<br /><br />I did not look at combined runnout.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I've been in a bit of a dissatisfied mood with nearly every new book I've picked up lately, but Courtney Milan has never disappointed me. I realized I had one of her books in my review pile and eagerly dove into the Brothers Sinister series. I had read The Governess Affair back when it was first released, and I loved it - highly recommended; now I was hoping that I could fall back into the wonderfully described world and meet more incredibly realized characters here.<br /><br />I made a good choice. Finally. The Duchess War made me chuckle from the very beginning. I knew immediately that I was going to like these characters, that I'd end up loving them.<br /><br />Robert Blaisdell, the Duke of Clermont, is the son of the antagonist of The Governess Affair. As such he's spent the majority of his life trying to use his father as an example of what not to be. His father used and abused people, hurting and discarding on a whim; Robert chooses to take care and try to help - in fact he feels it's his duty to serve those that may not have the same privileges as himself. A radical idea at the time, or even now amongst some. He gets tongue-tied, is honest, and beautifully direct. More than once his dry humor and lack of artifice made me smile, grin and laugh.<br /><br />Minnie on the other hand is full of strategem. She's intelligent, strong, reserved, cunning, vulnerable, and a realist. She has had her dreams ripped out of her and refuses to entertain the notion again. She's just so incredibly clever. She doesn't like using her cunning against anyone else, but she knows that it might be the only defense she left at some point. I loved her no-nonsense attitude, the way she faced things head-on and tried to make the best decision available. There were times when I was like her best friend, urging her to reach a little higher, to look up, but I came to understand why she couldn't either. That she was who she was, regardless of it all, made me admire her so much more.<br /><br />The secondary characters here are just as vivid. From Sebastian and Oliver, Robert's family - his fellows in the Brothers Sinister; it's amazing to watch the three of them together, or in pairs. The commradarie, the friendship between them filled with jokes and support and obvious affection. Violet, another childhood friend, was wonderful. A strong woman, able to not only hold her own against three strong men, but challenge them. I loved her immediately. There were many others, and I can't wait to see more of them in the coming books.<br /><br />I won't speak too much about the plot, mostly because I find it hard to find a lot to say about it. It was the characters that really were the story for me here. The plot was the events that drove the characters and didn't register as important to me. I did find it interesting though, the thought of what Robert was trying to do, Minnie's history, how all the players were acting and reacting. But for me, it was all about the characters.<br /><br />Courtney Milan is one of those few authors that is a go-to for me. Her writing is always strong, her sense of history is impeccable, and I absolutely love her characters. Not to mention that Ms. Milan takes the conventions of the genre and subverts them so beautifully and naturally that I wonder why the conventions are the norm anyway. The Duchess War was a joy for me to read precisely because of each of these./>The secondary characters here are just as vivid.

I did find it interesting though, the thought of what Robert was trying to do, Minnie's history, how all the players were acting and reacting. But for me, it was all about the characters.<br /><br />Courtney Milan is one of those few authors that is a go-to for me. Her writing is always strong, her sense of history is impeccable, and I absolutely love her characters. Not to mention that Ms. Milan takes the conventions of the genre and subverts them so beautifully and naturally that I wonder why the conventions are the norm anyway. The Duchess War was a joy for me to read precisely because of each of these.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Nice game to lose yourself into...Wish it had more places to go through. I like how it switches due to the holiday.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|So far this game is great. Having to use health plus money and crystals definitely makes it different than the rest.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|Use it for my Samsung Galaxy 2 due to a sale on Amazon. I believe it would work well for any 7&#34; tablet. Note no opening for charger cord. Not an issue for my use.

B006LRUVUA|5.0|I've just installed this app and used to connect to my win8 laptop. It just works as a win 8 tablet!  avery nice job.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Fun and challenging. Lots of levels, some start of easy but get more challenging. Really makes you think and have to come up with solutions which are not always obvious and can be not what you're think. Hours of entertainment!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Love this little movie.  Could watch it everyday.  Rango is just a typical story about people living in the town called Dirt but these little characters have heart.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I really did not know what this app was. I thought it was a picture edit. well whatever you want to download if you send it there. click snap and BAM its in your gallery I think for this app to work its best you need Evernote. Evernote is another great downloading images app.
B008220D5K|1.0|What is it with movies today?  All the F words and the final straw for me was when Paul Ruud naked, legs up in the air,<br />ask his wife to look in his anus and tell her what was in there?  People we all have body parts, but the movies never ending interest and body parts and body fluids have just stopped me from going to the movies.  There is no flow to movies or anything that could interest a normal person,maybe a teenager whose hormones are throbbing in his/her groin.<br /><br />I noticed the first review that Amazon chose to put on the pro side of the review said he/she could identify with this movie... well I sure as hell wouldn't want to know them... just go away, far, far, away
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's a cool but very hard to beat sometimes and the colors are wonderful I love playing candy crush  !!!!!!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Out of the three, this book is my favorite. The new characters make it and the suspense throughout the book makes it a quick read.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album truly shows Gagas musical genius. She is not just pop she switches genre in her music rap rock dance electronic she does it, and does it better than other artists can. This album will slay your life.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|First, let me say that like many people, I have read and have loved The Shining.  When I first heard that Stephen King was working on a sequel, I'll admit that I was very apprehensive.<br /><br />After Finishing Doctor Sleep, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say that if you have ever wondered what ever became of Danny, you owe it to yourself to give this a look.  I'll warn you, though, it's not a \\"they all lived happily ever after until the end of their days...\\" kind of story for The Shining, but is instead what I feel is a believable, logical progression for Danny.  Even though I always hoped that Danny would come through everything that he endured unscathed and well-adjusted, but that would have been wishful thinking.  It affected him...a lot. This is a story about just how much and how he fought his way past his demons left over from this horrible events from his childhood and finally found his place and his purpose.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'll say this: Defiantly not as good as the original, but still a worthy, entertaining read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy that  candy crush saga is finally on The kindle fire I was waiting forever but it is really addictive..
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Awesome game that keeps my brain working overtime.  Choices of grids makes the game extra fun and challenging and also helps to build your math skills.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its a very good game and i like it a lot im not that far yet but it is still good
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|I am a huge Eminem fan. His first trio of albums (The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show) are considered as some of the finest albums ever made in music history. Each of them had a distinct personality and theme, and as an artist, we see his progression as he goes strength to strength on each album, each one better than the last. Encore was a letdown, but he more than made up for it with 2009's vastly underrated Relapse, and he completed his comeback to the zenith of music with 2010's Recovery. In 2013, he reaffirmed his status as one of the all time greats with what is undoubtedly THE album of the year, The Marshall Mathers LP 2. This album exceeded each and every one of my expectations; it gave me genuine chills, it made me laugh, emote, reflect, gave me shockwaves and with the song 'Headlights', made me burst into tears.<br /><br />As an album, MMLP2 is a combination of all his previous best works; we see hints of SSLP, throwbacks and influences from MMLP and emotions directly lifted from TES. There is no doubt that Eminem has delivered yet another classic, one that rightfully joins the original MMLP as his best work so far. Jaws will be dropped, and emotions will be poured. Ladies and gentlemen and Stans, this is the album we've all been waiting for. The one that proves Marshall Mathers, Eminem and Slim Shady are all back, with a bang.<br /><br />G.O.A.T
B00F3VOL38|5.0|This year marks the 50th anniversary of the release of The Beatles' first album \\"Please Please Me.\\" The four lads from Liverpool were the biggest thing in popular music during the 1960s, and many folks still think they're the biggest thing in pop. Nearly everything they played, sang, said, and did was recorded, so there's a deep back catalog of words and music, a remarkable quantity of it still unissued by the copyright holders. Bootlegs exist, of course, but their quality and provenance are highly variable, and their cost can be exorbitant. \\"The Complete BBC Sessions,\\" for example, a rare nine-CD box set produced in Italy in 1993, contains portions of 44 BBC appearances, but it will set you back hundreds of dollars - if you can find it.<br /><br />John, Paul, George, and Ringo appeared no less than 52 times at the Beeb between 1962 and 1966, performing for \\"The Light Programme\\" at the beginning of their careers both in studio and before audiences on a variety of live shows. However, it's been nearly 20 years since the first volume of selected recordings from that era was officially released in 1994. \\"On Air - Live at the BBC Volume 2\\" at last brings us more of these broadcasts, two CDs full of great music, youthful exuberance, wit and humor. As on the first set, a 48-page booklet is enclosed, this one with an introduction by Paul McCartney. There's also a long essay, numerous photos, session details, and track-by-track commentary.<br /><br />This package contains 40 musical performances, 37 of them never before issued by the BBC, EMI, Apple or Capitol (the first volume had 56 songs, 30 of them previously unreleased). Between the songs are 19 short clips of banter among the boys and their rather plummy radio hosts in which they tease one another, respond to fan requests, and discuss a variety of topics such as the making of the film \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" in 1964. These interpolations give you an experience very much like the one you would have had listening to the programs on the radio. You are a witness to the birth of British Beatlemania.<br /><br />Seventeen of the tracks are Lennon-McCartney classics like \\"She Loves You,\\" \\"And I Love Her,\\" \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\\" \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" \\"You Can't Do That,\\" and \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\"; the remainder are covers of songs by the likes of Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Little Richard, Arthur Alexander, Goffin & King, and Lieber & Stoller. So many of my favorites are here: \\"Chains,\\" \\"Words of Love,\\" \\"Roll Over Beethoven,\\" \\"Twist & Shout\\", and \\"Long Tall Sally,\\" together with delightful surprises like Chan Romero's \\"The Hippy Hippy Shake,\\" Ray Charles' \\"I Got A Woman,\\" Carl Perkins' rockabilly number \\"Lend Me Your Comb,\\" and his country ballad \\"Sure to Fall (in Love with You).\\" There's even a tune that appears nowhere else in the Beatles discography, Stephen Foster's \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" in the form of an utterly transformed rave-up.<br /><br />Extended interviews with each of the four lads are appended as \\"Pop Profiles,\\" two at the end of each disc, totaling 35 minutes of relaxed, down-to-earth charm. Recorded in November 1965 just before the release of \\"Rubber Soul\\" and in May 1966 during the \\"Revolver\\" sessions, these conversations saw the Beatles talking candidly about their musical influences and the processes of composing and recording as well as their families and living situations. They discuss the activities they were enjoying, how the public seemed to perceive them, their childhood memories, and their hopes for the future.<br /><br />The monophonic sound is pristine throughout save for a couple of slightly muffled tracks included for historical reasons (\\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" and the Chuck Berry rarity \\"I'm Talking About You\\"). The playing and singing, needless to say, are top-notch. You won't be able to resist Ringo's full-throttle vocals and George's guitar solos on \\"Boys\\" and \\"Honey Don't,\\" and you'll thrill to John's raucous voice on \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\" and Paul's iconic leads on \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"Lucille.\\" You might even find yourself screaming along with the girls in the audience when you hear the boys' harmonies on \\"From Me to You.\\"<br /><br />In his introduction, Sir Paul expresses great pleasure at this collection: \\"There's a lot of energy and spirit. We are going for it, not holding back at all, trying to put in the best performance of our lifetimes.\\" He explains that their fascination with American music and their first attempts at songwriting were inspired by listening to the BBC and Radio Luxembourg, browsing manager Brian Epstein's record shop, and hearing about new sounds from peers. Since there's so much talk on the set, it may not be quite as wonderful as Volume One, but no one can say that all of the world-changing music and joyful nostalgia aren't worth 20 bucks.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I  started to play this game and I am glued to this game right now I,m on the minion  beach.It is awsome
B002C6A6N6|1.0|The quality of this dvd is so bad, its ridiculous. The sound and pictures never align, no matter what you do. The picture quality is bad. There are no subtitles of any kind.<br /><br />This dvd is the reason why I will never buy any series from America for anyone ever again.<br /><br />Discovering that a gift you got someone for Christmas is barely usable and they have 120 hours of rubbish, because either the studio or A&E couldn't be bothered to do their jobs properly
B006FTCH2E|5.0|This is a stunning film with the most fascinating premise.  It is full of surprises. While a sci-fi film it really explores so many dimensions of human pain and regrets. I wish Brit Marling would do a TedTalk about the making of this film.  She has such a talent for writing and of course, acting.  In fact, the acting in this film is simply wonderful.  The ending blew me away (one of Brit's great talents is endings).
0375869026|5.0|Memorable story that really got my kids thinking about some of the ways THEY'd like to make a difference for someone at their school.  Well written and fun to read out loud.  Kids loved it.  Made a few of us cry near the end.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Lots to do and very fun. They keep adding to the maps and lots of other cool things. Battling is a blast and intense.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Kind of sad in a few  chapters, but is happy too. Loved this book! A whole buy book for all ages.
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|This is an excellent movie!<br /><br />We thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to others frequently.<br /><br />Some friend of ours told us about it and we're so glad we checked it out.<br /><br />It's very inspiring and we heartily recommend it.<br /><br />This is one we would have as a keeper in our library.
B00821OX98|5.0|I don't have cable.  So I waited for this to come out.  Great quality streaming from Amazon Prime.  Excellent show with not too many character flaws.  Cant wait for the next season- #4!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I have played it before on my DS and it was awesome!!! but it wont download on my kindle :( what do I do?
B00BXDOSXS|5.0|This app I would have to say is a must have because if you have a kindle like mine that always glitches you should get this. My kindle had deleted all the videos that I had gotten and about few weeks before that I had gotten this app and I went back on this app and it had all the videos I had downloaded even though my kindle suddenly deleted all my videos . I'm very thankful to this app or else I'd be so mad right now. I still am but less cause this app.
B001QU0WGU|5.0|Many, many issues/re-issues of Kind of Blue over the years both in Vinyl and CD.  Of the digital versions, this issue is one of the best.
B008469DGY|4.0|great for playing a quick game while waiting.  If you are bored in the waiting room and you don't want to read a 2 year old Car and Driver magazine you can download this game and play it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is pretty awesome to play & fairly easy as well. The clues are laid out for you to find in the open which makes it nice. The levels get harder the higher you go which is nice as well, it keeps you interested.
B00CO4KGYA|1.0|pointless, dumb and irritating.  I got it for free and still wanted a refund.  With so many other things out there to keep you amused why waste your time with this one?
B007SYWFRM|4.0|ice age village is a cool game to pass time,only wish they would stop going up $ every time you level up on property. and wish they will give you more acorn's and every time you up date game you lose your friends needs to stop.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|the picture was cute but the game leaves a lot to be desired.  There are many other games out there that are better.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Sheldon, Leonard, Howard, Raj, and Penny. Who could ask for more?! It doesn't matter how many times I watch these episodes, they're always funny.
006202406X|1.0|I suppose it is rather unfair to rate this before finishing but I simply can't get past the first few chapters without being totally confused.  This addition of two person perspective was not well thought out and is poorly executed.  I really enjoyed the first two books, so this is a big disappointment so far.  To anyone reading the review, just stop after book 2 and don't purchase this one.  After reading the other reviews on the rest of the book I'm going to be hard pressed to finish this book.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Moving, real, uncomfortable, heartbreaking, hopeful.  Once I started reading this book I couldn't put down the painful but fascinating story of Victoria's (the main character) emancipation from the foster care system and redemption from childhood trauma and violence until near the end. Then, the story became so real and suspenseful, I wasn't sure I wanted to continue for fear of breaking my heart. However, Vanessa Diffenbaugh masterfully turned the story around and I was crying from relief and happiness over Victoria's move from victim to survivor to potentially loving adult with the help of the language of flowers.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Overall a good game I don't play alot on my kindle but when I do I'll play this for its surprisingly good graphics nd gameplay
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Works just as described.  Definitely a huge plus being able to see your composition.  Comes with extra backs, which is a nice bonus.  Eats through battery life pretty quickly.  One thought for those that Dive, the waterproof touchscreen does a great job in wet weather and just beneath the surface of the water, but if you are going to go any deeper than 4-5 feet, use the solid waterproof door.  I found that the water pressure creates too much force on the touchscreen film and it kept changing my settings without notice, which was a bit frustrating.  But the issue is solved by switching the covers.  With the rigid (non-touchscreen) back it works just fine and you will need to use the buttons to cycle through the settings if you need too.  Great Accessory for the GoPro Hero3.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is one of the best games I've ever played. It's also free, so if I could, I would give it 10 stars.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Could be more challenging in the beginning. Good size tiles and easy to see matches<br />Up looking forward' to playing Moe challenges
B00CWY76CC|5.0|wow<br />this game is really fun and challenging. I cannot wait until the next levels are available. if I could I would give this game more stars.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|What a great book, had me laughing out loud, wondering why I share so many traits with an obviously slightly nutty person, when I thought, well I guess I am slightly nutty too. Allie Brosh is an amazingly honest and compelling writer. Hope there are more books to follow. I'll buy them all and recommend to every one I know.
B00GHJ6BJW|4.0|When you get to the level of popularity that Gaga has reached you have to know it's hard to top what you've already done. And people are so quick to tear down your latest work. Let me say I am a fan of Gaga's music not her costumes, videos, or theatrical stunts, that being said I feel the music of Artpop is an excellent addition to Gaga's body of work. she's trying some new things some of them work for me some of them don't. The first thing I notice is the noticeable absence of religious thems in the songs which is a plus for me, I don't feel that religion should be used as a shock value hook in music and that's what she did in several songs from Born this Way. She has some very strong entrys on this album Venus,Sexxx Dreams, ArtPop,DO What U Want,and Gypsy really shine they sound like Gaga with nice new twists.<br />Some songs have such a heavy use of electronica they are almost unlistenable I like Swine but the screeching electronica in the background was so strong they overwhealm the vocals and make it hard to make it through the song. Donatella, Mary Jane Holland,  Aura,and G.U.Y also suffer from over use of Electronica, I know she's trying something new but the music many times is tearing down some great vocals.<br />She trys 2 colaborations on the album Jewels and Do What You Want. In Jewels she is totally over taken by her colaborators and basically sounds like a guest singer on they're song rather then the other way around. Do What you Want is very different though she meshes perfectly with her collaborator and makes a very nice slow jam for the album.<br />My biggest beef with this album is the over use of electronica not the songs themselves except for Dope. I think it was supposed to be a ballad similar to You and I but it turned out to harsh for my tastes.<br />Overall this is a good album but I think it could have been so much better with different background music I think its deffintly worth adding to your music library!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The story - riveting. The first person account - astounding. Honor, Valor, Courage and Integrity. What more can be said.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I've had these headphone for 3 month i don't know where 2 start with the problems and where 2 end they stopped taking a charge. the mic turn's on all by itself there's feed back sometime for no reason. they do sound great but with all these problems and the price they just suck. i will no longer be purchasing any logijunk products again.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very addicting show! Love the suspense and drama! Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a good show to watch.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Beautiful music! Celine has a way of putting meaning into her music. I always enjoy listening. The song love me back to life is about someone being held and starting to cross over to death and her love one literally loves her back to life :) a sweet song. I really like incredible the best though. Powerful musician. She excelled on this CD
1451695195|1.0|I felt very uneasy reading this book and could not put my finger on what was wrong; just that in my deepest being, I knew his experience was fake.  I have read other NDE accounts and this one did not ring true.  Now that I know he is not a man of honor (read the Esquire article), I do not believe or trust anything he writes in the book.  The only book to trust on heaven is the bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ.  Jesus said \\"I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me\\".  It's that simple.
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|Wonderful purchase. I will recommend this to all my friends. If your looking for a bit of modern ragtime, jazz, this is it. Caro Emerald is the best artist I have had the pleasure to hear in a long time. love love love it!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best season of Walking Dead yet. Other seasons kind of dragged in the middle but this one is pretty interesting most of the way through.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Good read.  The story took some interesting turns.  What started out like a typical read turned into pretty good science fiction. Looking forward to sequels.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|For me this was the last good season of this show. I couldn't fully get through season 6. It is more of the same. All of the seasons have been pretty consistent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this title because once I started reading it, I just couldn't wait to pick it up and see what happened to Kat and Peetah. I did not watch the movie, but have seen trailers for the second movie and decided I should see what everyone liked about the first book. So glad I did! It held my interest and was an easy read. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I can't believe they split this book into three movies, however that said I am a total fan boy and though long winded, it is still very good.
B000JML7EC|4.0|Certainly a classic, but after a sail with my son to Normans Island, BVI, I was excited to read to story inspired by an island that we had anchored. An easy read with the only challenge being the kings english.

It ends with a promise for part 2, and when you click on it it is only available for IE on your PC!  I am using the 8 x 9 Amazon Kindle HD. I love it. I also have the regular Kindle Fire, but the charger won't work anymore.  Any one have any Idea where I could get the piece sottered back on? My kids love it and I would love to get it fixed!<br /><br />Seriously, GREAT game!!!

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Don Tillman, a brilliant but socially challenged genetics professor, is at a loss as to why he -- a prime specimen of mental and physical fitness, with an above average income, should find himself still single at the age of thirty-nine. Previous attempts at finding a life partner, while attempting to operate within society's accepted norm, a.k.a. the \\"traditional dating paradigm,\\" had only led to unmitigated calamities such as The Apricot Ice Cream Disaster with Elizabeth the computer scientist -- an encore of such horrors to be avoided at all costs. Such forays into traditional mating \\"rituals\\" having proved to be complete wastes of time, money, and his not inconsiderable intellectual resources, and so Don has abandoned his search.<br /><br />Thus resigned to his single state, Don is relatively content, until a chance opportunity to speak on the subject of Asperger's Syndrome opens his eyes to the possibility of approaching the dormant Wife Project rationally and scientifically. The result is a sixteen-page survey designed to eliminate those deemed incompatible -- the drinkers, smokers, picky eaters, chronically late, and otherwise intellectually lacking and therefore wholly unsuitable as long-term candidates for Don's project. With the scientific rubrics in place, Don is sure of long-term, scientifically validated success until Rosie Jarman walks into his office. Rosie is ostensibly a Wife Project applicant, but one also in search of her biological father -- the latter a quest Don is imminently suitable with which to assist. As Don gets to know Rosie, it quickly becomes clear that she is the antithesis of the ideal candidate the Wife Project questionnaire was designed to uncover -- and Don is forced to confront the idea that the most unsuitable woman in the world might just be his perfect match.<br /><br />People, READ THIS BOOK. The last time I found myself so utterly captivated by an unconventional romance was Rainbow Rowell's Attachments -- and to those of you who've read and loved that novel as I do, make of that comparison what you will. *wink* Author Graeme Simsion takes his background in IT consulting and screenwriting to craft a fast-paced, charming debut novel as full of unabashed romantic heart as it is of the scientific precision with which Don constructs and lives every aspect of his life. And much like Don, pre-Rosie, Simsion's prose and plotline are crafted with a laser-like precision -- this is a textbook romantic comedy that manages to hit all the requisite story beats while remaining wholly fresh and unique thanks to Don's delightfully prickly and precise personality.<br /><br />Rosie describes Don resembling Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird -- if only he had the right glasses and haircut. And while I may never recover from the swoon induced by the mental image of an endearing, socially-challenged Gregory Peck, for what it's worth in my mind Don most closely resembles Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory, with a slightly less acerbic wit and a touch more warmth. Don wants to figure out this puzzle called life -- he'd like to better navigate society's murky waters, but without the emotional component or drive serving as an impetus to do so, he's at a loss...until he meets Rosie.<br /><br />And therein lies the genius of Simsion's characterization -- The Rosie Project isn't about \\"fixing\\" people, or excising everything that makes Don a wholly, wonderfully unique individual. It is the story of one man whose genetic make-up conditions him to view the world through a rational, scientific lens, meeting a woman whose fractured home life has conditioned her to view it through an emotional lens -- and finding in their relationship and polar opposites personalities a connection, validation, and support that complements one to the other. We're all flawed in some respect, and perhaps the greatest danger lurks in buying into the lie that society's perfect standard, if unmet or unrealized, equals some sort of human failure. As Don learns on his roller-coaster journey, change -- equal parts terrifying and exhilarating -- is possible for even the most recalcitrant member of the human race.<br /><br />I find myself equal parts intrigued and terrified at the thought of Hollywood turning this charmer of a novel into a film -- but Simsion has done his part by providing a detailed road map for the transition of Don's story from page to screen. Rarely is a novel so perfectly suited for film, as The Rosie Project is essentially the classic screwball romantic comedy in novel form. This is the rare story that hits all the beats of the format -- from the \\"meet cute\\" (here, the infamous Jacket Incident) through the resolution/joyful defeat without feeling the least bit tired or over-done. Don's status as a romantic hero operating from the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum brings a freshness, warmth, humor, and unexpected vulnerability to the page. This is a story that is a stark, gorgeously-rendered reminder of what it means to be human, of the beauty and pain that make up life in equal measure. The Rosie Project is a warm, humorous, always honest, occasionally heart-rending tale of love found, nearly lost, and found again between two of the most perfectly imperfect and -- on paper, at least -- incompatible characters one could hope to meet. A charming, life-affirming, hope-filled romance, Simsion's debut is as much a love letter to life as it is a beautifully-crafted romance between an atypical hero and his maddeningly wrong \\"perfect\\" match. This novel is an absolute gem, and I cannot wait to see who Simsion introduces to readers next.n failure.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great 2nd book, maybe even better than the first book.  Great story and hopefully has a good movie as well.  I love her character, poor man's hero.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game. It's challenging, but not so much that you can't still enjoy it. I like that I can take my time and can work through the levels at my pace.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I really enjoy this game, and it is gets pretty challenging as you move on. However there's one problem that bugs me. After I do a level perfectly and I get a gold check, it doesn't save it. Today when I was playing all my gold checks were gone. I still think it's an amazing game though and well worth the dollar!
0062239422|5.0|Loved this book. I'm a tough reader of books, I have a hard time getting into a book. This book was read in less than 2 days. It was suspenseful, tear jerking, an all around emotional dollar coaster. I would HIGHLY recommend this book.

B00F3VOL38|4.0|Fine, more previously unreleased stuff, all good.  The real issue is, why is this the only new Beatles release we are getting for this holiday season.  Specifically, where are the re-issues on vinyl of the original albums in mono?  It was bad enough that we didn't get them last year when the stereo ones were re-issued on vinyl, but I thought for use we'd then get the monos on vinyl this year.  I suggest all Beatles fans agree to boycott all Beatles related releases including this one and McCartney's new solo album until we get the following:  1)  The first 8 albums in mono, on vinyl, mastered in pure analog from the original tapes.  2)  The last three albums in stereo, on vinyl mastered in pure analog for the original tapes.  3) Forget this Past Masters and MMT album crap, we need a box with all the 7\\" singles and e.p.'s on vinyl.

B000JMLFLW|5.0|I can't believe how long I have put off reading this classic. Jane Austen is an illustrative and humorous author, and the story is well-rounded and elegant. Coming from a family of five sisters, this story especially resonated with me. Anyone looking for a solid, entertaining story of romance and sisterly love need look no further.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I like it. I wish it was more like hunting....that you have to look for the animals insteadnof them just standind there.....that's what hunting is all about.

B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|This is a didactic and flat piece of work despite the importance of the themes addressed by Eggers.  There can be no ambiguity about the author's position on social media and internet surveillance, but neither is there anything to the characters behind what they 'represent.'<br /><br />I liked the satirical aspects of the writing.  When the apocalypse comes, it will preserve vegan options, solicit your feedback, and force conformity in the name of ending oppression, elsewhere.  The main character does a daily 'cleanse' by responding to endless, cascading product surveys.  Eggers's bead on the lexicon of the interwebs is deadly.<br /><br />What bothered me is the sex.  This book is written for 12-year-olds.  The pacing, 'revelations,' redundancy, and moral sense are not too far off from what one would find in a fantasy series.  That's fine; adolescents need to read this book more than anyone else does.<br /><br />So why should kids have to hear, in detail, about the main character's (Mae's) sex acts with different people?  They prove that she's pliable, has no stable sense of self, lives for others' validation, but since Eggers makes these points over and over elsewhere in the book--and much more convincingly, elsewhere--they could easily have been cut.<br /><br />You may say Orwell.  For godsake Eggers says Orwell a little too insistently: 'Privacy is theft' etc.  Fine; 1984 also had its weird sex aspects, but they were psychological, not graphically depicted.  The sex in this book just seems slapped in there to give the book a PG-13 rating.<br /><br />Eggers is supposed to be one of our 'major' writers, if not merely a genius of branding.  Perhaps he realized what he had written and couldn't stand it, like Jonathan Franzen realized that Oprah saw the truth in his novel and couldn't stand it either, and he put this crap in to cover it up.
0375842209|4.0|Written with a &#34;voice&#34; I have never heard (don't want to spoil it for you) and clever at that…<br /><br />Story set in Germany at one of it's worst times…the life a young gal with the voice adding commentary here and there…<br /><br />It's a fast read and very touching.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book. It is so simple yet so thought provoking. I also highly recommend it for anyone who is not necessarily a sci-fi fan. This is not your typical sci-fi book, plus it's fairly short. It's great for a long weekend indoors.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Worked great and how it should. It was a great buy and helped decrease the room needed to play.  When I put it on I made sure to line it up correctly, so I could see the spot for the lasers.  Not complicated and would buy again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's very addictive, especially when you don't have enough life's to complete some level and eagerly waiting for them to build up and pass to the next one. Definitely love this game and I recommend it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Only pocket sharpener I've found that works. Worth the money. I've even entrusted some of cooking knives to it! Hones my pocket knife to a razor's edge.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Truly finds the human heart. The Corrections is a very good novel but feels contrived at times. All works of art are artificial and man-made.The artifice in this book is well hidden.<br />The book is the story of a family with characters that breathe and live in our world.<br />Franzen has the audacity to invite comparisons with Tolstoy. He aims high and largely achieves his aims.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|I have loved this game ever since I played the DS version on a friend's. I got the regular version but wasn't as impressed with it as the Super version. Let me just say that .99&cent; is completely worth it!!

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Season 2 of Breaking Bad continues the incredible premise set up by the 7-episode first season.  The dark humor is intact, as well as the intense action and drama that made Season 1 so groundbreaking.  The storyline is intriguing, but Bryan Cranston's acting makes this one of TV's best shows.  The man is captivating no matter what kind of scene he's doing.  We all know how well he can pull off humor from his work on Seinfeld and Malcolm in the Middle, but he can do anything and everything else required of Walter White's character.  Any emotion you can think of, he can find the perfect facial expression and voice to make the viewer feel exactly what his character is experiencing.  When you have an actor who can carry a show like Cranston does, you don't need to have one of the most compelling plots ever thought up for a series...but Breaking Bad has that, too!  The ripple-effect of consequences stemming from Walt's self-destructive decisions continues to spread wider in this 13-episode season, and Walt seeks deeper into the underworld of the drug game.  The show resonates because we all say we'd do whatever it would take to protect and provide for our family, but how far would we really go?  How many of us would stoop to crime if we thought it would leave our families financially secure for their entire lives?  Desperation can be a powerful motivator, and this show clearly makes that point.  With an incredibly strong supporting cast that's just barely a notch below Cranston himself, Breaking Bad has more to offer than just about anything on TV.
B007708Z7G|2.0|The copy I received was a Spanish copy.  I am an American, I speak and read in English.  I realize this is not Amazon's fault, but I did not order the Spanish cover copy.
0345803485|1.0|Perhaps I should consult my inner goddess before I write this review, but I'll risk it since she is probably too busy \\"doing the merengue with some salsa moves.\\"  This book is nothing more than a plotless compilation of crap.  There is no storyline- aside from Ana's blushing, clambering, lip biting, peeking, shattering into a million pieces monotonous sex life.  The characters are unbelievably unrealistic and yet somehow the author lacked enough imagination to render them even remotely likable.  I would have been more thrilled with the story if Ana had been consumed by a pack of rabid dogs as punishment for all of her flushing, blushing, and lip biting.  More than once I found myself so vividly angry with the book's lack of substance that only the thought of burning it could soothe me.  I could only endure reading half of it before I gave up hoping that it would miraculously get better.  The time I wasted reading this utter nonsense, I want it back.  Every copy of this book should be collected and burned to rid the world of the author's idiocy.  May god have mercy on those who suffered through reading this \\"novel.\\"
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Let me start by stating that I loved the first two books.  I was surprise how perfectly written they were. The storyline was amazing. Yes, I know that it's similar to twenty other books, but something about it grabbed my attention.  You are introduced to a girl, who in order to become free and able to understand herself she has to break her parent's heart. Then you are stunt as this meek girl, become an amazing woman.  Who spires other to be equally as great.<br /><br />***************warning: SPOILERS************************************<br />Then you come to the last book what a disappointment that was. We find out that their entire lives where lies, manipulations of doctors and politicians to refuse to be wrong. Then the death of TRIS, I was so heartbroken. I understand that not every character that we fall in love with will make it to the end. But how can you kill such a powerful young lady in that manner.  She survived so many other things even the DEATH serum and its killed by a guy in a wheel chair who loved her mother. REALLY !!!!!  I would have been ok if she had died as a result of sacrifice but at the end of a bullet. I refuse to accept that.  Then theirs Tobias, he was so fragile that this would have killed him. And if that was her point to present Tobias, as a stronger character now and being able to survive everything.  She could have gone a different route.  She could have killed his mother, after reconciling by his father.  Then you also killed his friend, who he feels responsible for.<br /><br />I honestly believe she ended the book in such a manner just for shock value so her book would be talked about.  I guess it worked, but I hope she is ok with loosing the respect that her readers had on her.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Amazing. I now understand why this is one of the highest rated books on Goodreads. I don't know what more I can say. I'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson now.

B00EL6AAEU|5.0|Blackfish... Wow what a great and emotional documentary!<br /><br />This movie will have you crying for the whale calves as they're<br />pulled away from their mothers in the wild and also when you watch the tapes of attacks and 911 calls for murdered trainers.<br /><br />In short, Seaworld does not care about humans, marine animals, the environment, or even their trainers (despite almost 100 cases of injury or death from whale aggression.. Often from the same whales!) Seaworld will do anything and I mean anything to keep money rolling in.<br /><br />Heartless.<br /><br />Before you think this is just another animal rights documentary, know that the whole film is populated with the actual former trainers from Seaworld and live footage of what has really happened. Trainers who were never told of any danger or past accidents.<br /><br />This film is a life changing experience!

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Minion Rush is a great game but in terms of unlocking new characters it is way ridiculously expensive. If you were to buy all of them the money you would spend could buy you a new kindle fire hdx and accessories plus lunch for 4.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|The game is great but it you do earn enough coins or money to keep up with the game or the introduced difficulty.  It is obviously geared to make the player spend money to buy the basic necessities which is a turn off or let down.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is very fun and hardly gets old but needs new stuff so it can be more fresh and fun.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It actually works pretty well.  HOWEVER, you can ONLY broadcast netflix and youtube from with IOS.  The APP itself works great EXCEPT when it comes to pausing and restarting it.  It can take multiple tries to get it to stop.  I was led to believe it would work with anything broadcast from Google Chrome.  However, Google Chrome does not support IOS.
B00GHJ1S2M|2.0|If you've never heard Madonna's music, then this is something brand new for you. Gaga's clearly copying Madonna's career, step by step except Madonna had credibility and originality. Her music sounds good but so does  Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and the other popsters in her category.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|It action. It's Dredd. I like explosions hot chicks with gun and 3d. Old school action at its best. No plot to muddle up the splosions and guts.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|You people who say &quot;can we get an update?&quot; You have to look up the name of the app then update it if it needs to be updated. It's really good in my opinion and I like it a lot
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love that the game keeps up with the holidays by changing the costumes. I hope that in  the future, other levels will be added to prolong the great experience that comes out of this game. You can never get enough of it.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved it!  Pure Grisham-interesting plot, great characters, and a happy ending.  Jake Brigance is one of Grisham's best characters-so glad he decided to bring him back.  I'd love to read more with Jake and the gang!

0385351399|3.0|I recently have become an avid social media user after mostly ignoring it for many years, so I hoped this book would offer me perspectives on the positives and negatives of this new development in my life.  He brought up many valid points about the political dangers of allowing tech companies to get too powerful, and I hope the discussion provoked by this book leads to new legislation to restrict tech power.  In the good old tradition of dystopian science fiction, he took trends that exist in our present-day world and imagined them continuing in an extreme way.<br /><br />However, parts of it felt like an old man's \\"get off my lawn!\\" rant.  He didn't allow for the possibility that real relationships could ever form through social media, presenting all social media connections as fake relationships.  This has not been my personal experience.  In real life, I'm an introvert forming deep connections with few people, and online, I'm exactly the same way.  It's not true that social media turns everyone into shallow, attention-seeking extroverts.<br /><br />In the beginning he establishes two extremely likable characters (Mae and Annie) but he doesn't develop them in a realistic way.  One of them becomes a victim and the other becomes a villain by the end of the book.  To me, it's not plausible that shy Mae would become a privacy-destroying villain, or that spunky, afraid-of-nothing Annie would become a helpless victim.  The implausibility of these character developments ruined the book for me.  The author cared more about demonstrating the dangers of his dystopian world, than he cared about developing his characters in an authentic & plausible way.<br /><br />I also don't think it's plausible that the general populace accepted the advances of the totalitarian society without questioning it.  The only people in the book who question the evil takeover are Mae's ex-boyfriend, her mysterious lover, and a random senator. I think the novel would have been more realistic, and thus more scary, if they'd pictured a strong opposition being crushed, rather than almost everyone being such huge pushovers.  I do think people value privacy enough that it would be very hard for a real-life take-over of this nature to happen.<br /><br />So his ideas are definitely worth thinking about and discussing, and I'm glad I spent my time reading the book.  But even though he had good ideas, he didn't tell a good story.  I almost wish he'd written a nonfiction essay instead, instead of deluding me with this promise of a novel that was not really a novel but a thinly disguised rant.hus more scary, if they'd pictured a strong opposition being crushed, rather than almost everyone being such huge pushovers.

B00DGMVJAO|5.0|THIS FEATURE HAS A GOOD STORY LINE. THE GRAPHICS ARE EXCELLENT; IT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING. IT PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE A GOOD TV SERIES. I BOUGHT IT TO KEEP IN MY LIBRARY, IT WILL BE GOOD FOR GET-TOGETHERS.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game. Only drawback is that the file size is so large and energy takes a long time to restore. Otherwise very fun game.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Great game! If you love the movie you'll love this game. My 4 year old is taking it over. Graphics and sound effects are even better.

B00004YYDI|5.0|Having seen this in theaters in Newport News Virginia in 1994, I remembered what an impression it made on me originally. Well acted, well executed, with an outstanding performance from a young Natalie Portman. But this version takes it to a whole other level. Adding back in bits that actually flush out the dynamic between Leon and Mathilda being taught to be a &#34;Cleaner&#34; really add to the movie and should have been left in the original cut.<br /><br />I have to agree with the assessment that it is stunningly violent and morally wrong on multiple levels. However the very moral grey area Leon chooses to work, (mainly bad guys who have done bad things), makes it similar to the Crow in that the men he kills are ones you wouldn't care are erased from this world anyway. Overall, outstanding movie, one of Luc Besson's Best.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|My favorite musical :) Audrey Hepburn is fabulous and beautiful and the story is classic. Everyone of all ages should see this!

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I like the game very much but I have finished the first game and went to the next game Relic but can only get to it by doing the #40 game in the first match by winning it again.  I have done the same thing with the next game.  Surely there is an easier way to get to the second and third game without have to win the #40 game the second, third, and fourth time.  I enjoy playing the second and third games too.<br /><br />Pls let me know at busybee@adams.net.  Thank you.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|A wonderful, and tragic story full of good and very bad people.  I'd say the good guys won this time,  As World War II as it stage the characters were full of hope and dare I say it: evil.  I truly believed in the moral strength of man and women to survive and pursue righteous morality that is deep seated in all people.<br />This tale of woe is a must read for all seeking another dimension of people living to survive by overwhelming odds.<br />Outstanding!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is one of the best free games I have ever downloading....it's kind of hard at first but you get the hang of it.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|This review is for film lovers who expect more than a \\"hyped-up,\\" \\"over the top\\" version of a \\"Transformers\\" movie.  \\"Pacific Rim\\" failed in three important categories:  Number one; it had no plot, Number two; it was loaded with copycat scenes from other movies and Number three; I didn't believe a bit of it.  Films such as, \\"Godzilla, Rodan, Alien, and Avatar\\" all had plots, were original and unique, and most important...they all made me believe what I was looking at.<br />Guillermo del Toro, is a great director, but must have been under pressure to perform because the film came off looking like a rushed, Japanese-British collaboration of the worst kind.  Well then, why did I give \\"Pacific Rim\\" three stars?  I gave it three stars for the one thing it had, \\"entertainment value\\".  The stereo-sounds, special effects, and gobs and gobs of fight scenes.  All of these things made \\"Pacific Rim\\" worth seeing. However, my favorite scenes in the movie were the ones with Japanese, child actor, Mana Ashida.  She is not on the screen long, but is definitely a scene-stealer.  Loved seeing Ron Perlman again, Guillermo never fails to create the wildest characters for his actor friend.  Perlman is able to play the most interesting caricature roles, even though I am still waiting for a Hell boy III.  I might be a little pickier since my first science fiction movie (1958 Rodan), but I am no longer a child.

B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|I grew up reading the Hobbit books. And this movie was a big disappointment. I would not recommend this movie.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I bought it and it was great, but you had to buy the next levels. People said with the world pass, you only got six new levels, then you had to buy for six more levels. I am not sure, but it clearly says when you bring it up that you will get all current and future worlds. I will check this out, but I am not sure what will happen.

I read the Wishing Spell also and these both are SUPER AWESOME!!! I really hope that Chris Colfer makes another book in this beginning-to-be-series, but I really recommend this to everybody! I'm not a big fan of fantasy (still am a fan, though) but anybody can absolutely love these books.<br />This is written by a 10 year old so things in opinions may differ

B005GG0MIS|4.0|A very well written look into a &#34;club&#34; that is not well known. It kept my attention from beginning to end. I was most interested in the way the past presidents are able to put aside their politics and provide whatever help was needed to the current office holder. A revealing look at the members of the club.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's confusing and very hard to use.I would not get this book ,because it is not worth it at all.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|Twenty-eight and a Half Wishes reads more like mystery/fiction than romance, although I did find it in the romance category on Amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  The characters were very believable and imperfect; indeed, their imperfections made me like them more.  The mystery was neither overbearing nor boring, a hard line to walk.  I enjoyed this book so much I purchased the next book in the series (even though I'm no fan of the mystery genre).  There is a love plot in the book, but it is never graphic.  I really enjoyed watching Rose experience life for the first time and grow as a person throughout the novel.<br /><br />The only reason this book didn't get five stars is because I hate it when the protagonist story does something she knows is dumb, for reasons that have no basis in logic.  Not going to the police several times was dumb.  Not being honest with the love interest was maddening at times.  I could see why these things were done, though, so it wasn't a total frustration.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|One of the most enlightning and comprehensive Books on World War  2, well documented and enjoyable, credible human and sensitive characters.

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|good game but they make you pay to go further which I will never do and that is a disgusting practice I abhor. Would not have wasted my time to begin with if I knew this.
B00FXES5WS|5.0|Love this album...every song on it is beautifully done. Susan''s voice and the recordings get better with each album. Susan's voice is like a bell with a combination of strength and vulnerability. Thanks to youtube for making her audition video available around the world. Susan is a gift to all of us.
B002CIY8EM|4.0|Erich Von Daniken is the godfather of the ancient alien idea. In this book, he has laid the foundation for said idea giving way to a new thought process when it comes to studying our past. If you like having your mind blown, this book will far exceed any expectations.
B001TH16DI|3.0|I'd gotten used to the director's cuts that were released some time ago, and was dismayed by the missing scenes. I didn't even remember that the &#34;missing&#34; scenes were never there in the theatrical cuts.  The director's cuts were much better.  Little innocuous scenes here and there didn't necessarily drive the story, but helped eke out a little more character development which is never a bad thing in Trek films.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A great book! I felt like I had first time fallen in love all over again! A must read for all!!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Reading 5% a day / listening while driving around to the same novel  on Audible.com which syncs with Kindle due to Amazon owning both entities allowed me to plow through this 1200 page tome in about a month as a farewell pact to get it read before my son reports to Navy basic training in about a week. Well worth it! Book 2 comes out in March 2014: looking forward to it!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|works great, purchase one unit, liked it so much, purchase other one for the wife's car, would purchase again, great product
0393343405|3.0|In spite of Greenblatt's literary and historical  expertise, the author's theme and intent  restricted his selection of historical facts in order to promote his personal theme of scientific materialism as the one &#34;truth&#34; that comes out of man's historical achievements.<br /> Since most viewers, especially the devotees of scientific philosophers such as Dawkins and company were  elated over this  historically sweeping detective tale, chockfull of historical incidents little known, or remembered, History's whole story passed them by..  A bird's eye view of the inquiry was not presented.<br />The Swerve was a scholarly  tale of historical sleuthing, which  in the end leaves the reader with the propaganda for one side of the philosophical coin. Therefore it is  A road of discovery for atheists who have a nodding acquaintance with History but a lot of information pertaining to the scientific materialism of the Post Modern era.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I give it five stars.  He Is a great writer.  I wish I hadn't read<br />it so fast.  I never want to put it down once I start reading<br />I've never read a book of his I didn't like.  I highly recommend<br />John Grisham to everyone who likes to read.  His parents live<br />in the same city as my Mom did when she died.  She started<br />Reading his books at my home. She liked them as much as<br />do and sorry she missed this one. I cried at the end.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Came in great shape. Thanks for the promptness. I appreciate it. I haven't used it yet. But,when I need to use it I will see how it does.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I just finished the book and I'm going for a three star review because I didn't think the book was great, but I also didn't think it was terrible, especially not when you consider its target audience is over a decade younger than me.  I've read some other reviews before writing this, which actually made me consider the book more closely, and will influence the review below.  That said, there will be some major spoilers, so beware.<br /><br />First of all, as stated above, this was just a fun book to read.  A lot of YA books sound like they contain really cool ideas and twists on various fantasy or sci-fi themes, but the writing is so terrible and the characters so one-dimensional that I can't read more than a few chapters.  I had no problem reading this book and staying interested in the plot.  I also thought that Clare had a (sadly) few good original ideas.  Namely hiding the cup in the painted tarot cards things using runes.  And a couple characters, such as Magnus.<br /><br />And that's where the good things I have to say end.  Not that the above is a great summary of what she did well, but it makes more sense to explain the things that didn't work than gush over the things that did.<br /><br />I'll start with Clary.  I didn't find her nearly as terrible as a lot of people on here do.  For example, a lot of people complain that she \\"hates Isabelle just for being prettier than her.\\"  I took a different spin.  Yes, Clary does bemoan how beautiful Isabelle is, and she probably does say some things on the surface that seem rather mean.  But I took these as typical teenaged exaggeration, and an acknowledgement that we all feel insecure next to someone else.  Yet here's what really bothered me: Clary just doesn't add up.  At the beginning, we're told that she and her best friend Simon are only at the club Pandemonium because Clary likes it there.  Yet as we get to know the characters, Simon the musician seems like the one who would prefer it.  Clary is a jeans and a tee shirt, off the in clouds painter/reader.  There's nothing about her that convinces me she would enjoy clubbing.<br /><br />Another note about Clary, although this isn't about her as a character: a number of people complained that Clary didn't know how beautiful she was until Jace told her, and how cliché that is.  I agree, I guess, but this brings up another point.  Why is it that in these novels even the otherwise ordinary, sweet, interesting (although that last is debatable) girl also has to be gorgeous in order for the male characters to be interested in her?  Why can't she be pretty, but ... well, ordinary?  Because that's what the majority of girls reading this book are.<br /><br />Next let's talk about clichés and plot holes.  The biggest one first.  Who read this and didn't guess that Valentine was Clary's father?  I mean, seriously.  I thought about it probably from the first time Valentine was mentioned.  And then we find out that Clary's mom was married to Valentine.  I thought to myself ... no, she wouldn't pull a Star Wars.  But alas she does.<br /><br />And Jace as well, and his father that he loved so much but who, the more you hear about him, sounds more and more like a sociopath?  I was hoping that part wasn't true, because I was actually hoping for a real love triangle.  Something that would keep me guessing.  And then I would understand, except that it's not even done well.  Jace finds out that his father is Valentine, and he doesn't question it, or think it's weird.  He doesn't consider the fact that his father faked his own death in front of him and abandoned him until Clary shows up and points all of this out to him.  Though up until this point in the novel, he seems, if nothing else, reasonably intelligent.  And even then, ok, maybe he doesn't care what his father did and he's just happy to have a family and feels loyal to him ... it certainly seems that way as Clary begs him to consider otherwise.  Until all of a sudden he changes in the other direction for what I felt was very weak dialogue on Clary's part.  And then there's the fact that they still seem weirdly close and codependent even after they find out they're siblings.  Jace talks about how Clary, his sister, makes him feel settled.  That just sounds weird to me.<br /><br />To be honest, I enjoyed the first half of the novel much more than the second.  The first was more interesting as we were introduced to the Shadow world, went into the City of Bones, went to Magnus' party, fun things like that.  There was a lot of build up.  There was the cup that no one could find, there was the issue of Luke (who obviously was hiding something and wasn't really trying to get rid of Clary), there was her mother and the Clave and Valentine.  I expected some of it to be revealed and resolved and some things to build up even more, but instead I felt like there was just too much all laid out on the table in the very first book, with not enough satisfaction and not enough held back to keep the reader interested.  Rather than having to know what happens, which often spurs me to read the sequels to books far worse than this one, I feel like things are resolved to an extent that I could be content not reading on.<br /><br />Why, you ask?  Let's use Valentine as an example.  He's a pretty standard villain.  Others have pointed out his similarities to Voldemort and I can't argue.  That said, at least Voldemort was a bada** and in many cases Harry barely survived encounters with him and only because of these exceptional circumstances.  In this novel, I got to the end and found myself asking: WHY WAS EVERYONE SO AFRAID OF VALENTINE?  I mean, from the beginning, everyone talks about how V was nearly undefeatable.  Actually was undefeatable if you consider the fact that he's somehow still alive.  The first scene where Jace, Clary, and Simon overhear the conversation between Luke and a couple of V's lackeys, it seems clear that Valentine is not someone you mess with.  Later, when Luke tells Clary about his past, he basically tells her that Valentine tutored him and that he was never any match for this great warrior.<br /><br />Then this great warrior is ALMOST defeated by two nearly unarmed teenagers and an injured werewolf.  If it was that easy, why didn't someone go after Valentine sooner???<br /><br />Not only that, but Valentine probably wouldn't even have escaped if Luke hadn't run to Alaric's side, which is another thing that made NO sense.  Gretel was his \\"second\\" about half an hour before that but when she was killed outside Luke barely blinked an eye.  Now he's got Valentine, the evil overlord he came to kill, at sword point, and he gives that up to go to his new \\"second\\" because he feels so terrible about Alaric dying because of him?<br /><br />The ending just felt like too much happened too fast, with no satisfaction and no real climax.<br /><br />There were other inconsistencies scattered throughout, little things that just didn't necessarily add up.  At the end, when Clary goes back to the Institute, one of the characters tells her that Alec and Isabelle's parents are rushing back from Idris and will be there in a couple days.  This is already at least three days after Alec is near-death and Hodge betrays them, which we know because earlier Clary comments that she's been checking in on her mother at the hospital for the past three days.  Now, it says in the book that Idris is essentially hidden somewhere between France and Germany.  Even if you were relying solely on \\"mundane\\" travels, it should take at most 24 hours (considering wait times and things like that) to get to NYC, not a couple days, and that's not even counting if they could rush things along, being Shadowhunters.  Then consider that it's already been at least two days since Isabelle must have been able to contact her parents and the clave.  Now, if you found out that your teenaged son had almost died while facing an \\"upper demon\\" (or whatever Clare called it) would you really take minimum four days to get to his side unless it was physically impossible to get there faster?<br /><br />And Alec's character to me, is another example of where the story could have been better.  So when he and Clary meet, they don't hate each other but they don't get along great or anything.  But tension builds and he and Clary have a big argument in the middle of the book which I quite liked.  They both said some awful things, which we all do sometimes, and let's face it, not everyone is going to get along with everyone else.  That's normal, and it would have made Clary seem more real.  The next morning, Alex begrudgingly goes along to help Clary but only in order to protect Jace, at which point he is wounded nearly fatally and is unconscious.  Yet the next time he sees Clary suddenly they're friends.  What?  I believe a work of fiction more when there's some amount of conflict.  Some people just clash, and if your character doesn't, it means she dangerously close to being a Mary Sue.<br /><br />Anyway, to wind things down here, there's a summary of the major problems I had with this novel.  As I said, it was still more readable than a good number of YA books I've attempted to read.  It's engaging and it has some original ideas.  But there are also a lot of plot holes, and a lot of things I think could have been better built up.  I'm not sure if I'll read the second book.  I don't feel compelled to do so; there's nothing I'm desperate to find out.  I already know basically how this series will end, if not the exact details.  But if I ever need an easy, engaging read, perhaps I'll decide to give the sequel a try anyway ...
B0063M22QO|5.0|it is extremely relaxing and enjoyable-just what I need to exhale and have an easy time to calm my busy day/life. Thank you for your app
B000QI2ZWW|3.0|Watched this with a group of friends, and we were mixed on the rating. A couple friends gave it 4 stars, and two gave it 2 stars. So we will split our rating down the middle.<br /><br />There are many detailed reviews here, so I will leave you with our rating...
0790732254|1.0|I love the film, I HATE that it has been ruined by the 'bugs' that flash a dozen or more times on the upper right corner of the screen. These are apparently meant as an anti-piracy device. However, they are so very distracting that they destroy the mood of the film. I will NEVER buy another CD/DVD that has them. This is like getting Beethoven string quartets and having a cymbal crash a dozen times through the music. I have loaned a friend my original DVD of &#34;Virginia Woolf&#34; and will ask for it to be returned. And, I will certainly send this ruined DVD back to Amazon.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This may be one of the greatest Angry Birds apps yet. The ability to sling pigs is just plain epic. Also, even if you complete all the episodes, there's still more to do. It has ads, but not too many, so it's almost perfect for ad haters. You should download this app, even if you dislike Star Wars. Five stars for this epic app.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|The game is as awesome as temple run two except for one frustrating requirement. The characters are WAY too expensive. I've played other games.<br />I can compliment the game on their fun way of switching areas inside the Land of Oz. I personally luv the Emerald City! Gorgeous setting and animation smack damn on your Kindle screen. If you like a good endless runner game with hard money earn, this is spot-on for u. Go be a champ and get on that leader board!!;)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|All the other reviews here say it for me.  Divergent and Insurgent were amazing.  I fell in love with the characters and the story.  I think we can all agree that real life is tough, not a fairy tale and that we don't always get the perfect ending.  But that is EXACTLY why I love to read so much.<br /><br />This book not only crushed me, but left me with a gaping whole in my heart for two characters whom I had grown to love.  It should not have and did not need to end like that.  However, I guess it should not have been a surprise.  The entire book seemed off from the beginning as I kept forgetting who's perspective I was reading as they seemed to have no real distinguishable voices, however, when I got to the end I realized why she wrote it that way.  The character development was beyond weak and lacked all the emotion and fullness that 1st two books had.  We also saw many characters who made no sense at all.  Evelyn and Marcus were complete breaks and 180 degree changes from how they had been built the two books prior.  Also, the weak story of the Bureau, fringe, etc. simply did not make any sense.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it!I'm close to being very close to getting the megalodon,which you unlock by getting the great white for35,000 coins. It is SUPER fun and I recommend the touch control.I'm a kid so I know a good game.I love the theme. I think it might get easy because the megalodon can eat jellyfish and mines,which are my two main causes of death, but I might be able to see new things so that's cool. It does not have a lot of blood which is great to me but if you want bloodier scenes and some guts, you can get Blood Bath for fifty gems<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting the baby tiger shark. You should buy the map. When there are big open spaces,there are always mines and a lot of jellyfish near the bottom. If you like survival games, this is an epic must-have for u.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|This movie rises and falls because of the sheer charisma of Gerard Butler The Scottish actor is perfectly cast as the Spartan king Leonidas;except the historical figure was nearly 50 when the events of 480 occurred.The situation involving the character Leonidas,is similar to Russell Crowe's \\"Gladiator\\" hero;sequel possibilities are very limited.But Butler has more than enough star power to make up for weaknesses in the film.This film is drama not a history lesson.The Scot has made a deep resume since the 1999,biopic \\"Attila\\",and this film earned it's iconic status. This is a fun popcorn movie; and almost legendary film. And in this case that is enough.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The graphics are better than temple run the original.I understand that they made this with better graphics. And yes you are challenged more even though there are zip setting changes.the zipline is a great way to escape from the mutant gorilla.MANY (in capital) more better animated characters. Gems provide new goals to set upon. It updates very fast. Yes there are updates. Some games Don't give updates. A good simple not-so-scary hand-eye coordination game.My sister and I love it.OMG!! Go Imangi Studios!!:):):):):):):):):):):):)$$$$$$ not required.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I already want to reread this book. The characters are so amazing. The narrator is definitely unique. The story is one that has never before been told from this perspective. This should be required reading for high school students.
B0086700CM|4.0|Good graphics.the game is great.the chararacters look like cheapskates made them.otherwise the game is good.I was talking about temple run.<br /><br />Now for elite gaming universe.<br />It CLEARLY<br />says on the bottom of the description when you the whole thing that...<br /><br />THE GAME IS ONLY PICTURES!!!!!!!!!!LOL:b<br />It's okay.just whenever you're going to buy something, read the description.You're welcome and no offense taken to anyone.:):):):):):):)@ 2:51AM I wrote this review.there will be zip edits on it.

B008YW5RH2|4.0|its a fun addictive game. well made and no slowness. Although i'm not sure what the logic is behind some of the game play, i do feel if i do the same move twice, its does not necessarily have the same outcome.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The book had great experiments to try and it really made seeing the universe at work really FUN. I would recommend this book to anyone who knows how the universe works and for those who don't believe it. Just open your mind and let it flow!
B008469DGY|4.0|super addictive, but it gets pretty hard after a while. graphics are great and game play is good. i play this on my commute on the kindle fire hd
B002UD56I6|5.0|Michael Jackson was as extraordinarily creative and talented and amazing as he was extraordinarily weird.  This captures the best of him, it's great entertainment.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I hesitated purchasing this version because of the packaging complaints. But I thought, who cares?, why pay a lot for packaging, besides, it is very compact. Ok, After 2 seasons worth of the theme song, why would you continue to listen to it. I do what I do for all complete series intros, I fast forward through them. I figured out a simple solution to the two stacks of discs. Just take a blank cd or dvd holder and use that to stack the watched dvd's onto it. If you put them on upside down, when you watched all of the discs on one side, just pull them off the spindle, turn the whole stack, label side up, now all of the discs are in chronological order. Problem solved. Now just get your laughs and at a bargain price.
0194325385|5.0|It's a good dictionary with a lot of useful examples. It's a good complement to Oxford Advanced Learner's English dictionary.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy. Absolutely amazing! I loved the plot and background given. so many ups and downs and the characters compliment each other so well! I hung on every word and found myself holding my breath every chapter anticipating what would happen next...so glad I picked this series first to get back into reading...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally got around to reading the hunger games and it was well worth it. I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to Catching Fire!!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was fascinating. I actually started reading it after seeing the Netflix show based on the book. But, even though I enjoyed the tv series, I found the book to be so much better and what an eye opener!  Having led a very safe and privileged life, I was amazed to learn how women live & survive inside the prison walls. I sincerely hope that more people will read this book and that someday our justice system can be changed to truly provide justice to all.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Best way to keep up with my bff' s it is so much fun cheating back and forth plus there's never a time when somebody's not online
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Every time I play the game it really fun because it's so challenging, ans I love a good challenge. Also I like the fact that we have an option to pur use different things on the game.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the Walking Dead, season 3 is a little slow but it's still really good, dramatic and riveting. If yo like Zombie movies then this is a MUST watch.
0061730335|5.0|Inspirational!! I've chosen this book as 1 of the 2 novels that are required reading from my English course. The students are  so impressed by William's story
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I've always loved this Broadway musical and really wish I could see it live. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves musicals and cats.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I like the game overall, but having to wait thirty minutes for a new life is ridiculous! The waiting ruins the enjoyment of the game and happens frequently.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The exciting second season of walking dead. Everything gets a lot more thrilling and dramatic in this series. If you liked Season 1 then you'll love season 2.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I would not recommend this to anyone except those that can take a chance on feeling disappointed after 500 pages of literary perambulation with a dismal conclusion. There was a lot of work devoted to this book and the author is very proud of it. She is definitely a wonderful writer, this just wasn't a good use of my time and will not sustain me in the way a good book does.
B008JFLWLE|1.0|This was a waste to get. It didn't help me at all. I don't recommend this to anyone. There are a lot better items you can get to help you with Math. Guess I shouldn't have had such high expectations for an App.
B00D82BNLC|5.0|This book had so many nutty writing, POV, and formatting issues that I wanted to hate it, but the characters were endearing--even if stolen straight from Ghost Adventures and Paranormal State. Very much enjoyed the resolution. Refreshingly not what I'd expected, but story aside, the book would GREATLY benefit from a thorough copy edit.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The exciting and thrilling first season of the Walking Dead, I highly suggest this movie if you love Zombie movies.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|What a refreshing take, even for a single young woman like myself, to read about what the big deal about marriage is anyway. Why do we do it? What's the precedence? Why should I or shouldn't I? But reading this book let me know that my chosen path, whatever that ends up being will be brilliant.
B005MHI0QM|1.0|I kinda feel bad for giving this a 1 star rating because this is a true story about the horrors this girl went through but I just hated the book. I think other people will enjoy reading this book. But just not me, I read almost all of it but I just couldn't make myself read anymore. I just got so bored, I know that might now be fair. But I just hated reading this book. I hate that she went through that nightmare though.
B00CZ1TMUQ|5.0|Simply fantastic! I love their voices, energy and heart-felt vocal performance.<br />This duos treatment of the songs is absolutely marvelous.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Many weeks after reading this novel, I continue to have &#34;flashbacks&#34; about the characters and the setting.  Very intriguing piece.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Game is great, but a lot of ads present through the game.  I haven't been playing for too long, but I hope there are lots of levels.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|First saw Celtic Woman on my local PBS station for the donation drive, which they were showing parts of this concert. I fell in love with this group! I am so happy to own the full version of the concert on DVD.
B00G9B1MEM|4.0|But it's surprisingly addictive.  The claymation looks very good and gameplay is pretty fun, yet weird.  It's like you squish a bunch of creatures to use them to make more creatures to squish to make your mountains larger.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I love this App!!! It notifies you when you need to clean your junk files and memory. Worth the the money!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device is excellent and works very well to play Youtube and Netflix content from my smartphone to the TV set. The only problem is the lack of more applications for playing content saved on my phone or other devices.
B007FTZDN8|4.0|Often have trouble viewing downloaded files when I have no connection. I like to have these for viewing on the plane, and for some reason the app wants to have a connection before it will run them. Very frustrating.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The characters were vivid and well defined. I have read all of Grisham's books and this one  was particularly poignant in how it brought to life the reality in the south and the very real divide between the races and the shadows they cast and long lasting memories!

B00BMKH5NW|4.0|&#34;Fangirl&#34; follows the life of 18 year old Cather Avery, although she prefers to be called Cath. She and her twin sister, Wren, are brand new college students. One of Cath’s problems is that she's not rooming with Wren; they're not even in the same dorm. Her new roommate, Reagan, is an older student who wanted (but didn't get) her own room, and is kind of intimidating to Cath. And Reagan always has this guy, Levi, hanging around with her. This book covers Cath’s first year of college, and the relationships she makes, both good and bad.<br /><br />Now, the important question: Just what is Cath a fangirl of? That would be the world of Simon Snow (who she slashes with with his roommate, Baz). Simon has seven books to his world and the eighth and final volume coming up before Cath will have to go home for the summer. Simon Snow is Harry Potter famous. (Harry Potter is even briefly referenced in this world.) And Cath is a bit of a BNF on her Fanfixx account (BNF = big name fan) thanks to the fanfiction she's created (some of which was previously co-written with her sister). Her current work, Carry On, Simon, has a very enthusiastic following, and she works on new installments whenever she can. Cath's writing (both fanfiction and original work) is an important part of this book.<br /><br />&#34;Fangirl&#34; intersperses each chapter with excerpts from &#34;actual&#34; Simon Snow books, or from fanfiction Cath (and sometimes along with Wren) has written. Make sure you pay attention to which is which, or you’ll get your canon’s canon mixed up.<br /><br />In the interest of honesty, I will admit that there were times when I wanted to reach in and strangle Cath. Where I was cursing at her, and wondering out loud why I was still reading this book. Cath is not perfect at all, and I honestly do like that about her (having read the whole book). She's a flawed human being who needs work, and it's good to watch her grow in this novel. So if you read it and want to strangle Cath at some point, I urge you to just keep reading, because she gets to be so much better. (Or you learn to tolerate her? I don't know. I like her.)<br /><br />I've reread the second half of this book (spring semester) over again since finishing &#34;Fangirl,&#34; and I'm thinking of rereading the book again. It is just that good. I'm only docking it half a star because of that one point during my initial reading. I'm docking it that half star because I had to tell myself to keep going, that SBTB gave it such a good review for a reason, to not give up on the book because the main character was frustrating the goodness out of me.<br /><br />If you're a fangirl yourself (or fanboy, or fanperson), I'd encourage you to give this book a try. 4.5 stars.rangle Cath at some point, I urge you to just keep reading, because she gets to be so much better.

159448385X|5.0|Such a horrific book about a woman's life, but a page turner.  I can't believe that this was required reading for my 15 year old grandson who is in an accelerated reading program!  The author is magical in taking you from being just the reader...into actually making you feel that you are right there in the story.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I haven't been playing this for too long but so far I like it ok. I prefer the point and click along with the hidden pictures but for a primarily ho game this one is pretty decent.
B00B9B4IYI|4.0|It works perfectly once connected, although I find that my iphone 5 has a tough time making the initial connection. It usually takes a few minutes of pressing the Yamaha button and telling my phone to make a new Bluetooth connection before the two find eachother, then it works flawlessly

0553582011|3.0|This book is like the NFL star running back that finally gets his big payday. Then doesn't need to produce anymore, and has the worst season he has ever had. It just seems that George R.R. Martin has gotten his big payday and isn't hungry anymore. I sure hope he has room for dessert. Because I really loved this story! Keeping my fingers crossed for book # 6 !
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A mesmerizing story, very well narrated. I cannot but admire Mr. Grisham vivid imagination. You will find the judge Atlee to be very interesting.<br />A very recommended book.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's a great bit of kit, but it's somewhat limited.  However, what it does, it does really well.<br /><br />Easy to set up and very simple to use.  Looking forward to it being launched on the European market so that more apps are opened up to it.  Currently only Youtube and Netflix seem to work with it - but to be fair, I knew that whan I bought it.

006202406X|1.0|(There are some plot references - that is necessity - but no ruining details, I don't think.)<br /><br />I really wish someone had warned me not to read this book at all.<br /><br />Many people have already covered the full details and scope of problems in Allegiant better than I. Aside from the broader text weaknesses (with POV and plot holes and a dragging story, etc) - when it comes to \\"THE BIG issue\\" - I just want to assure others that my utter disgust is not about my needing a \\"happy ending\\". I don't need that. I DO, however, need there to be some redeeming quality, some hope, contained in the close of the story. This ending feels completely stupid and needless. Despite VR's protestations, it feels like it's about the author getting attention, rather than about the characters.<br /><br />The big event happens for an outcome that is totally distasteful and unsatisfying, that accomplishes nothing in terms of what it does (or rather, doesn't) on a personal level for the characters.<br /><br />I have liked plenty of books that ended in ways that made me sad, but usually it feels justified in some way - or at least the \\"new normal\\" that comes after the climax has some redeeming value. But this doesn't. It is crushingly hopeless. That's how I felt.<br /><br />I have never hated a book or felt anger at an author like this. The whole series is ruined for me. I will re-read the first, but no further. And never, ever anything by VR again.
B008133JZG|5.0|A SCANDAL IN BELGRAVIA: The first episode of SHERLOCK Season 2 also happens to be my all-time favourite. Holmes and Watson go up against the sexy dominatrix Irene Adler, played to slinky perfection by Lara Pulver, to uncover a web of government intrigue and deceit. SCANDAL is the perfect mix of humor, action, personality, sharp writing,  and excellent acting from the incomparable Benedict Cumberbatch and the stupendous Martin Freeman. More than that, the twist ending is actually incredibly powerful and surprisingly moving. A Scandal in Belgravia is the Sherlockian formula at it's highest - Steven Moffat's intelligent writing combined with true style and class to create a riveting episode that ranks among TV's finest. 9/10<br /><br />THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE: Hounds is the weakest episode of Season 2, but that is not saying much indeed. It's like saying that Return of the Jedi is the worst of the original Star Wars movies - they're ALL great anyways. Hounds is dark and actually quite scary, but ultimately is somewhat disappointing. The suspenseful and excellent buildup leads to a conclusion that is too easy and Deus ex Machina-ish to live up to the first half of the episode. That being said, there are some great scenes, (including one of Sherlock's all-time funniest, which takes place in a Dartmoor pub), and Holmes's \\"Mind palace\\" sequence - one of the show's best. Russell Tovey is excellent as Henry Knight, Cumberbatch is as difficult as brilliant as we've come to expect, and Martin Freeman has never been Martin Freeman-ier. So while the ending of Hounds was a bit too easy, there's still a great, witty, smart buildup, reminding us that Sherlock is still the greatest detective show on television. 7/10<br /><br />THE REICHENBACH FALL: When I said that A Scandal in Belgravia was my favourite episode I wasn't lying. But The Reichenbach Fall is far and away the *best* episode of Sherlock ever, and deserves to rank among the finest single episodes in telly HISTORY! From the opening scenes, to Moriarty's (played to *electrifying* perfection by Andrew Scott) awe-inspiring theft of the Crown Jewels to the tune of The Thieving Magpie, to Moriarty and Sherlock's heart-to-heart, to the thundering, power-packing, unforgettable ending...Fall is almost perfect. Everything from the writing to the editing, humor, acting, sets, action, dialogue...I can't fault it. This is an episode that remains in the mind long after it's over; such lines as \\"Every fairy tale needs a good ol'fashioned villain\\" and Sherlock's cryptic erm...final message (spoiler alert?), and the mind-bogglingly good ending will leave you puzzling long after the show is over.

Until then, both Cumberbatch and Freeman can be seen (and heard) in The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug!the opening scenes, to Moriarty's (played to *electrifying* perfection by Andrew Scott) awe-inspiring theft of the Crown Jewels to the tune of The Thieving Magpie, to Moriarty and Sherlock's heart-to-heart, to the thundering, power-packing, unforgettable ending...Fall is almost perfect. Everything from the writing to the editing, humor, acting, sets, action, dialogue...I can't fault it. This is an episode that remains in the mind long after it's over; such lines as \\"Every fairy tale needs a good ol'fashioned villain\\" and Sherlock's cryptic erm...final message (spoiler alert?), and the mind-bogglingly good ending will leave you puzzling long after the show is over.

1451627289|5.0|This is not your typical Stephen King novel. It is a wonderfully written story of time travel, but also one of the greatest love stories I have ever read. It was not at all what I expected, and definitely not something I could expect from Mr. King. I absolutely recommend this to everyone, even those who typically do not enjoy Stephen King's horror novels. You might find yourself completely immersed in one of the best stories ever written.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Look, I really wanted to like The Alchemist. I really did.<br /><br />I went into this book with no baggage; knowing nothing of the plot besides what was on the back, and also that the book was a major bestseller - simultaneously lauded and criticized. And as I began to read the book...I really did like it. It was a lovely little fable about following your dreams, letting nothing stand in the way of your destiny, true love, religion, perseverance, wisdom, and hope. The writing was simple, and after fighting my way through just under a thousand pages of American Gods by Neil Gaiman, The Alchemist was just the refreshing little break I needed.<br /><br />So why 3 stars? Because you hear this sentimental, cliched, follow-your-dreams trite in every Disney film, every Barbie movie, every Hallmark TV movie, and every dime-a-dozen self-help book. And the worst part? It doesn't work.<br /><br />Now don't think me a pessimist or a nihilist - I'm all for underdogs and following your dreams, but if you tried to replicate the journey of Santiago the shepherd boy, you would end up broke, lost, and hopeless. Life simply does not work out like it does in Coelho's books. YES, help can come from surprising places, but more often times when you dream about treasure you are simply dreaming and no treasure exists. YES, God helps those who helps themselves, but everyone does not magically help you when you pursue your Personal Legend. NO, life is not a fairy tale, and the meaning of it cannot be written in just a few words. NO, when you stare at a grain of sand you are looking at a tiny bit of grit, not the meaning of the universe. That is not the way to seek out God (as this is a review of the product, and not a place to share my Christian religious views, I will not impose my views on you).<br /><br />Briefly (and it pains me to say this), The Alchemist is preachy, hokey, oversimplified, childish, false, and gratingly positive. There is nothing of real life in here, and while that may be good since The Alchemist is a fable, it will not work IN real life, as this is fiction and nothing but. It is, indeed, a well-written piece of fiction that is easy to read, pleasantly lyrical, and often heartwarming. But Coelho's character's views (I will refrain from saying they are the views of the author, as it is possible that they are merely the views of his fictional characters) on love, life, and destiny are misguided, *incredibly* preachy, sentimental, and schlocky. This is no more groundbreaking than that self-help book you bought by Doctor So-and-So because your best friend said it was \\"so amazing\\".<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong: Am I telling you not to read The Alchemist? Not in the least. This is very much a love-it or hate-it book, and who knows, maybe you will love it! But me (personally)? Not so much. I give this 2.5 stars, but heck I'll round it up to 3!<br /><br />P.S. I highly recommend the audiobook read by Jeremy Irons, whose legendary voice makes the whole thing (almost) worthwhile.

1575666286|5.0|I am in process of going vegan 100%, right now about 80% (plus) vegan. I saw a few documentaries on the Gerson Therapy and ordered the book. I think it is a great book to have and refer to for healthy diet. Glad I came across this. Thanks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Before I get into the opinion part of my review, let's look at some facts: It was late at night, and I was in bed. I was browsing my Kindle for a new book to read, and I happened upon The Fault In Our Stars - a book that had something about a cancer girl and was really emotional and sad...? Sounded girly, and I had previously read the first few pages in relative interest, but put it down and read something else. But I said whatever!, and began to read.<br /><br />I never intended it to happen, but the next thing I knew it was 4 o'clock in the morning and I was done the book, lying stunned, staring slack-jawed at the screen. John Green had taken me on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and I simply had no more emotions in me. Three things you should know about me: 1. I am an avid, ferocious reader. 2. I have never, ever read an entire book in one night. 3. This was the second time ever I read an entire book in one sitting. I think that says something in and of itself!<br /><br />...<br /><br />OK, now for the opinion part of the review:<br /><br />First the cons. Umm...<br /><br />OK, and now the pros. Really, this is hard for me to put in words, so I'll try not to gush. The Fault In Our Stars is one of the best books I've read in a while, and I read a LOT of books. John Green takes us on an absolute tearjerker of a novel, filled with wry humor, sly commentary, and raw emotion. The characters are some of the most compelling and relateable I've ever read, and if they don't pull on your heartstrings you have ice water in your veins. TFIOS made me view life in a whole new light. Going to sleep that night was not very easy (even though it was 4 in the morning); Green gave me a whole lot to think about.<br />It was real without being gritty, it was sweet without being sentimental, it was funny without being cheesy, and it avoided cheap emotion at all costs.<br /><br />Here's my advice: Go. Read. This. Book. Like, immediately. The Fault In Our Stars is the most poignant, funny, sharp, beautiful, and heartwarming novel of the year. This is an unmissable novel that should be read by anyone who loves someone. I can't believe I'm saying this - the very fact I liked this book should go completely against me. It's so rare that I'm this impressed with a YA book - so rare it's pretty much never. It's rare when something surprises me so completely. This book did. 10/10<br /><br />P.S. The line \\"Ma'am, your daughter's car has just been deservedly egged by a blind man. Please close the door and go back inside or we'll be forced to call the police.\\" deserves to rest with the all-time greats!ny, sharp, beautiful, and heartwarming novel of the year.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Great story, takes off from the first season and actually has a faster, more intense pace.  I really enjoyed this one.  The ending is unexpected and makes me so interested in the next season.  Very highly recommended.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The game was a lot of fun, with some very realistic movements. Very fun to work the weapons. Wish it gave you down range targets to hit.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|Missing In Action:  The majority of elements that made the first two installments enjoyable.<br /><br />The best way to describe it would be to reference a line from 'Heartbreak Ridge', in which Clint Eastwood is asked by a commanding officer to evaluate a particular operation.  In keeping with good taste, I submit that if you don't know the line I'm referencing...see the movie.<br /><br />Recommendation:  Avoid this last Transformer film.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so much fun. I think everyone will like this game. I don't regret getting it. The game is awesomly awesome and what makes it even better is that it's free. BUY IT. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this kindle game is AWSOME!!!!!!!!!! the only part that kinda sucks is there's  an end to the world! Also you can't  use a crafting table in creative!
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Cool but not the best. I like this but like I just said It`s not the best I`ve read so far.

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This was a great cast with a good mix of smart dialogue and action. A few plot twists kept it interesting through the end.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|I DOSENT WORK AT ALL the way I knew was disconnect your internet and &quot;hack&quot; it and it wasn't right
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|As a long time Dylan fan I have all the cds already - but this is such a nice compact way to keep everything together, it was worth buying. If you're a fan, I highly recommend :)
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Despite being in his 70's Macca can still bring it!  His latest album is a worthy addition to his vast and varied catalogue, the only thing missing from this CD is more of his work with the survivors of Nirvana.  It is NEW and it is McCartney, not a tragic remember me album but a stunning masterwork from a veteran musician!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, and I was super excited to see that it is now available to the Kindle fire. It is just like the computer version. Great game. PLEASE GET.
B00E95ED32|5.0|In case you haven't been paying attention, Avicii is slowly taking over the world with this CD.  And he deserves to, there is nothing wrong with this CD!  The songs are first rate, the performance is amazing, and the variety of songs proves that this artist will be around for a long time to come!  From the chart topping folkish &#34;Wake Me Up&#34; to &#34;Liar Liar&#34; and the other more EDM songs Avicii doesn't put a foot wrong.  Jump on the bandwagon on this one!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My sister got this app, and I fell in love with it. The only problem was that I refused to pay(I am kind of cheap) even if it was with the free coins Amazon gave me. That is why I was ecstatic when Amazon made it free app of the day. It is even better than anybody could imagine. I can NOT wait until the second one comes out.
B00E3Q71WM|4.0|Not the best Lizzy by a long shot, but also not nearly worth the bad reviews that this album gets.  Renegade has been one of my favorite Lizzy records for years, for the songs Angel of Death and Leave this Town alone.  But the entire album is strong, like I said, not their best, but certainly not their worst!
B008476HBM|5.0|As with Sense and Sensibility....I could not put this book down! I felt myself connected to each character...feeling admiration and disdain as I read each chapter. Jane is a literary gem. :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have always been a fan of Stephen king! Stories like this are why. I have yet to read a book of his that I did not love!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Great quality. Got it for five year old's birthday. Absolutely adorable. Kids began sitting it, pretending to swim in the pool. Great deal on a great toy she'll get lots of use from.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|Not very scary at all compared to the first 3 movies.  This was more confusing than anything else.  It's not a mystery but a horror movie, or so you think.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This series in general was so well thought out and beautifully written. In the end, this book was written with what was best for the plot, not necessarily the reader, in mind. Veronica Roth understood every corner of her characters' hearts and tried best to depict their stories to readers. Every action or feeling that Tris or Tobias felt seemed true to what would happen if they were real people. This book definitely was different both in plot and tone from the other two books in the series. The changes were welcome and exciting and fresh. Tris and Tobias' love is stronger than ever, and finally readers get to see his perspective and the genuine adulation he has for her. The new setting outside the fence opens many new questions and Roth wastes no time giving answers (opposed to the superfluous suspense built up throughout the  last two books).  Despite being set in a fictional world, I became so invested in the story, the characters, and the message of these books. There were parts of the book that left me angry at the unfairness of the whole situation but even though I feel like there could've been a better, happier ending, I know this is what's right and what's meant to be. It's all a bit bittersweet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You guys made this come from the computer xbox and now tablets and apple! Great job cant wait for the.redstone update!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|After you loose your complementary tokens  -- to continue playing this game you must buy tokens...So it's only &#34;free&#34; for  short period of time.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|this is just a copy because the devoper is re logic so it is fake.So don't fall for it.and I don't know how they were able to copy it.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|The songs appeared enjoyable but after some time the voice pattern seems repeatable. We listened to to CD for the first few days and got bored. Some variation in the voice would be very useful and exciting.
B00G32OER4|2.0|Rented this movie because it had good reviews. It was a horrible movie. Please don't make the same mistake I did. I'm actually thinking about trying to get my money back from amazon.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Wow! Has to be one of the best Westerns ever written, directed, and acted.  Although all the actors give very fine performances, and Kurt Russell is outstanding, Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday.  While visiting Tombstone a few years ago, I was told by locals that the shootout at the OK Corral as depicted in this movie is the most accurate of any movie on the subject (while still being Hollywood and taking a few liberties).<br />The director's cut gives a few more scenes, and the 2nd DVD has the added feature on the making of the movie.<br />If you like Westerns and haven't seen it yet, don't miss it!
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I miss the old maps, the place where people had their own pics and local tweets.  This new version is too homogenized and the photos, while nice, make it difficult to read.  It's like I've lost an old friend.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this book...until I didn't. Like everyone else I am not happy with the ending, holy heartbreak. I really wish it would've ended different or with a different major character dying.
0765348276|5.0|This is a great military science fiction book.  If you liked starship troopers then you will love this book.  If you love this book I think you will love ghost brigade even more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush saga is my favorite game!  I play it every day and so do most of my friends. It is very very addictive.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Give us more apps. And think worwidely. We love it but we need more from the device. And say to the Netflix people to improve their app to watch series continuosly
B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|I was incredibly disappointed with this book. so much was told from a secondary point of view. so little happened. and I constantly felt like I would be better served to go back and read the previous books again, which I would do gladly, but in the midst of reading this book it was frustrating to only half remember characters I last encountered years ago. Very disappointed. If you want to read this, reread the first two books before you do.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is truly the master of horror! As a life-long reader of his novels, to find out what happened to little Danny from The Shining, was absolutely wonderful. Thank you Mr. King.
B00F2362IE|1.0|this app caused each of our kindles we installed it on to freeze up.  had to restart the devices multiple times.  I wish i could get my money back. I removed it from all our kindles less than 24 hrs after purchase
B005LAIISA|5.0|Ice Age adds another epic adventure involving the so easily loved characters. Ice Age never disappointed me and may never will. The characters are so intensely loveable, and the plots are always amazing.<br /><br />Each Ice age seems to get better and better, and I am crossing my fingers for a fifth
B001DDBCUA|5.0|It's a good movie...mostly a chick-flick kind of entertainment but all can enjoy the give and take of these fine actresses in their lives. It's worth seeing.
0767817478|5.0|Epic and powerful movie with jaw dropping special effects. Godzilla stomps his way to New york city and wrecks havoc on the Americans instead of the Japanese for a change. It's a brilliant American remake and deserves 5 out of 5 stars.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter the seventh season just was released and it has made its mark on entertainment in a very special way. It's totally an adult theme entertainment but is wonderfully done and incredible enjoyable to watch.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|It's funny, interesting, romantic, a love story, easy to read, and a great story. I would love to see this made into a movie.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|The chemistry between these two young actors is phenominal and this movie is very, very entertaining. If you haven't seen it..you've got a treat in store. Recommend it highly to all movie lovers.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|This continued reboot of the Trek franchise gives us a slightly different take on the original cast's second film, Wrath of Khan. No spoilers here, but I'm pleased to see our favorite Vulcan giving in to his emotions on more than one occassion. The noise over Alice Eve's &#34;exposure&#34; was no more revealing than similar scenes from the first of JJ Abrams' reboots. And it was so brief that all it did for me was to confirm Dr. Marcus' original film comment that &#34;Jim Kirk was _no_ boy scout.&#34; Amen to that.<br /><br />No Trek film rates five stars (very few films do) from me, but this one was certainly satisfying and complete. All I can say is that I hope TPTB at Paramount can talk Abrams into doing more of the Trek films. He has a talent for bringing out the best in the entire production and I, for one, would like to see that continue.<br /><br />As far as performances go, they were about as good as you can get. While Montablan's original Khan raised the acting in the original crew's film, it wasn't needed here. Cumberbatch's acting continues to impress, even outside his unbeatable Sherlock role. His &#34;cold&#34; view of life around him actually matches his performances as Doyle's famous consulting detective and may be considered by many as an extension.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Kind of disappointed. Feels more like a series of events rather than a cohesive whole like the best of Tarantino films. Don't really understand what's great about Waltz in this one (I did understand the Inglourious Basterds hype). To me Samuel L Jackson deserved the supporting actor nomination (or win). Dude's fantastic in this.
B000002O7C|3.0|I had hoped for more of the music used in the credits in this recording. While it was enjoyable, it failed to capture the &#34;theme&#34; found throughout the movie. What interested me, though, were a number of pieces that didn't make themselves &#34;heard&#34; during the motion picture, giving us additional tracks that I otherwise would not have noticed.
B00DAXYNEI|4.0|It's not perfect, especially at the beginning. Really picks up towards the end to where I give the season a 9 as a whole, and most of it's due to Corey Stoll. Can't believe he didn't even get an Emmy nomination.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Loved this game on Facebook but it's so much better on the kindle. Seems like there's a lot more to do than the Facebook version.
B00F35BV64|3.0|It partially feels like a retread of the 2009 film and other Star Trek films. All the references feel REALLY forced sometime. I never felt involved in the story at all, which I felt like the 2009 did perfectly, and that makes plot holes all the more obvious and troublesome. But where most of these problems occur in the 1st and last acts, the middle of the film is enjoyable enough to make it 3 stars.
B000QGAU4E|3.0|I thought this was entertaining.  Yeah, it was kinda PC-ish, but the PC fit into the storyline well.  Good thematic visuals throughout.  The dialogue was a little clumsy in places, but, still, it was OK.  I also thought that there wasn't enough significance in the objective of two main characters, i.e., &#34;If you succeed, how are things any better?&#34;  Why it all mattered and what was going to improve if they were to succeed wasn't really presented to the viewer for him/her to contemplate.  The viewer has to supply these things through his/her imagination, which is OK, I guess.<br />At the end, I didn't feel like &#34;Damm, I just wasted 3 dollars and 1 1/2 hours&#34; or anything.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is a lot more entertaining than any other solitary game I have ever played.. It really makes you think about your next move.
B00139XZF4|5.0|Great movie! Love the story and solid performances by the cast. Daniel Craig shines in a role not too different from his Bond fame.
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|My Daughter is going to LOVE this.  Nothing is better than a gift a day.  This is the first year that I have gotten the kids their own calendar!  It is going to be fantastic!
B0052GACNM|5.0|I love Duets II with Tony Bennett and the various singers he chose to record with. It is a clear sound and I love the selections on it.
0002310988|2.0|I didn't get the cover that was shown and the seller wasn't very helpful. The book itself is a great book and would recommend it to anyone.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I loved Behind the Candelabra because it was well done and interesting to see Liberace and Scott Thorsen behind the scenes. I thought the acting was excellent and felt that Michael Douglas deserved the Emmy Award.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I did enjoy this book, and thought it was quite nice to know what happened in Danny Torrence's life beyond the Overlook. VERY interesting concept of the True Knot! It had a completely different &#34;feel&#34; than The Shining, and do note that this is a continuation of Stephen King's book, not the movie, The Shining. I do not recommend whisper-sync, as I could not stand the narrator for the audiobook. My advice is to read this one outright.
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|There are moments where suspension of disbelief becomes difficult; however, it's just as enjoyable as the first Die Hard movie.  It is also 10 times better than Olympus Has Fallen.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Great job doing this book Bravo !!!!!!!!,!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I love it was amazing every one in my town should read it
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I couldn't stand Casino Royal but Skyfall is arguably the best Bond film ever.  There is a classic Bond feel to this film; it goes right back to its roots. Daniel Craig is outstanding and Javier Bardem puts on an even better performance as the twisted, broken yet brilliant villain whom I couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for. I don't want to give away the plot but the story is tight and the action is superbly executed without seeming redundant or filling space. If you are expecting a love story subplot or a bevy of tantalizing Bond girls you will be quite disappointed. Bond and his girls keep their close on most of the time for this film. This story's heart is in the sadness of the profession, the cold brutal realities of living a life of murder, at times it reminded me a bit of Bourne Identity with its emphasis on the psychological wear and tear of service. The cinematography is exquisite with one of the most beautiful film opening credits I've ever seen in a film.  The problem with a film like this is that it makes it very difficult to have a follow-up.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|When Halloween was first shown in 1979, it began a long line of slasher films that continues to this day. I still get chills from the murderous rampage. I'm still infatuated with Jamie Lee Curtis. This is a good copy of the film. For $10 you can't go wrong!
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Classic Horror Movie. How could you not still be scared of this? It's like and old wooden rollercoaster with nails falling out and loose boards. It doesn't have the special effects or the speed like a new rollercoaster but it can be scary as heck just for that reason. OK analogy? :) By the way, My daughter grew up going to the circus just ONCE due to the clown that was in this movie and she's in her 20's! I guess I will be taking my grandson when he gets of age!
B000FA57US|5.0|Halloween 5 (aka The Revenge of Michael Myers) takes place a year after Halloween 4. Michael Myers is again after Jamie Lloyd. Jamie was traumatized by the last encounter. Jamie had been committed to a children's psychiatric ward. Jamie has a psychic connection to Michael. There's a lot of fine action and gory killing going on. I loved the movie!<br /><br />It's been digitally remastered, so the audio and video are superb. You can't beat this deal for the current price of $6.99.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This app is  Awesome! I love this app and I love to play this app who ever`s  out there they should play this game!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I'm a little confused about how I should rate this book. There were parts of this book that literally had me in tears. And, parts where I was scratching my head.<br /><br />I read a review someone else wrote that described Lake as acting just the way an 18 year old girl should. I couldn't agree more, she's believably immature at times but obviously coming into her own. As for Will...not so much. I could not fathom what his attraction to her was. He's supposedly this uber responsible guy who had to grow up fast the hard way. So can someone please explain to me his attraction to an 18 year barely legal emotional roller coaster? Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Lake's character, and she reminds me of every 18 year old girl I know. But Will? I don't understand the relationship between them. Lake repeatedly showed contempt (in my mind) for his position, I wanted to cheer for Will when he was so mad at her and Eddie in detention. His anger was justifiable. His actions towards her afterwards honestly just baffled me. I kind of wanted him to stick to his guns about not being together until Lake could grow up a little more.<br /><br />I don't know...I will probably recommend this book to people who enjoy the genre. It had very moving moments in it. But the lack of believability when it came to their relationship made me give it 4 stars instead of 5, still a good read.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|The versatile Lady Gaga returns to the world of dance pop with ARTPOP, her third (or fourth, depending on how you're counting) studio album. Unfortunately, most of the songs fall short of Gaga's typical shock and awe artistry.<br /><br />ARTPOP begins well enough with \\"Aura\\", a song that ponders persona and asks \\"Do you want to see the girl who lives behind the aura?\\" In the end, you probably don't. The song features Mexican/Spanish/Middle Eastern-inspired guitar playing, at least in the beginning, which is no surprise considering that the music was written with the \\"Machete Kills\\" movie in mind and contains awkward references to wearing a burqa. The \\"Machete\\" promo video is awesome, but the music loses some of its potency when it stands on its own. The thrill of the acoustic guitar sound is soon drowned out by blasted electronic dance music, and this sets the stage for nearly the entire album. Get ready for a harsh and exhausting romp through a minefield of sometimes interesting but rarely unified techno beats.<br /><br />\\"Venus\\", goddess of love/beauty, is one of the standout tunes. It's catchy, if a little hollow sounding, and the repeated lines \\"take me to your planet/take me to your leader\\" are simultaneously cliché and brilliant (or at least fun to sing along to). The phrase \\"Rocket Number 9 take off to the planet Venus\\" is an adaptation from a piece by Sun Ra that was eventually covered by Zombie Zombie. The Zombie Zombie version bares more lyrical resemblance to Gaga's version.<br /><br />\\"G.U.Y.\\" seems like it should have memorable hooks, but it's ultimately forgettable. Like in \\"Venus\\", there are ancient god references (Himeros, Aphrodite, Mars), and the song is about about being in control of love and sex. In \\"Sexxx Dreams\\" Gaga channels her inner Prince (as in The Artist Formerly Known As) then sings about the excitement of having an affair. \\"Jewels N' Drugs\\" is an awful oddball rap piece that I'd like to pretend didn't happen. \\"MANiCURE\\" features pop-rock and tackles love, insecurity, and... manicures. \\"Do What U Want\\" is about media attacks on and manipulations of body image. It's going to be one of the more popular tracks, but it really doesn't go anywhere musically or say anything meaningful, despite its commendable theme. \\"ARTPOP\\" has little substance and simply tells you that the term could mean anything. \\"Swine\\" contains annoying and lengthy dance breaks plus some Gaga squeals.<br /><br />\\"Donatella\\" is another standout, one that's catchy and funny (and a little sad) as it makes fun of Donatella Versace, fashion designer extraordinaire. Or weirdo. You be the judge, if you must.<br /><br />\\"Fashion!\\", an 80s-styled piece that takes after David Bowie and goes hand-in-hand with \\"Donatella\\", is a mediocre song about dressing up, but at least we get a bit of piano playing to lighten the electronic load. \\"Mary Jane Holland\\" is about lighting up in Amsterdam. \\"Dope\\" is another oddball as an exposed-vocal ballad with silly lyrics about needing someone's love more than drugs (love addiction). Think piano bar Gaga, which should be great except she comes across as drunk and disgruntled instead of raw and relatable. \\"Gypsy\\" is an upbeat dance track about enjoying a transitory life, and it will probably be another crowd favorite.<br /><br />And this brings us to another standout, \\"Applause\\". This is easily the most catchy, danceable track on the album. Who doesn't like applause? A solid way to end a largely lackluster album.<br /><br />All-in-all, this album is a disappointment in comparison to Gaga's previous releases. The lyrics have lost their edge, they contain all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, and the feminist undertones are shallow and contradictory. Songs waffle between women in control and women being controlled, which is one of the points of the album; when you're a rich and famous [female] artist, how much of what you've done has been shaped/controlled by society? The album holds together as a unified statement about artistic identity, but it doesn't showcase the versatility of Gaga's voice (more often than not she's belting out lyrics), music (which embraces unrelenting techno more than ever before), and lyrics. Few tunes keep me coming back for more. I simply have a hard time connecting to the music on this album, which feels like a watered-down continuation of \\"Born This Way\\" where Christianity is replaced with paganism and an even larger cult of personality.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|Adrianne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis, wow!!! And all in one movie!!! A couple hotties from the 70s (and still). This is a good sorta campy addition to the horror library.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />AU<br /><br />//(~_~)\\
B0072OFM28|5.0|This is the year when Andy Whitfield is replaced with Liam McIntyre and he resembles Andy so much and he does credit to what Andy started in Spartacus.
B002GSXKN8|4.0|I got a kick outta these movies.  A little campy as a Batman movie should be, but I found these to be much more enjoyable than the new ones that are out. The new one where Keith Ledger is the Joker is very cool. Both Jokers are cool.<br /><br />But what is up with Arnold Schwarzenegger? He comes across looking like the Pillsbury Dough Boy disguised as Frosty The Snowman.  He needs to stick with Terminator and Predator and Kindergart,,,well never mind on that one too.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />AU<br /><br />//(~_~)\\
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Andy Whitfield was and will always be my favorite Spartacus.  The writers and director makes the violence less bloody and to know what the slaves went through is mind boggling.  I do know real from TV
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Yeah, it's just OK.  Guess I'm burnt out on the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I'll go ahead and get the next installment when it's available.  I dig Gandolf and Gollum.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />AU<br /><br />//(~_~)\\
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|I bought these figures for my granddaughter to go onto a platform that is supposed to talk like the character but was very disappointed to find out that the platform doesn't recognize the figure at all.  Alone, they are alright - but if you are buying them to go with the Sofia Castle - I wouldn't recommend them.
B007QXWV1U|5.0|I think that this apt is great.. I downloaded my pics from Facebook and am making great pics worth hanging. This apt is the best pic app so far for my kindle fire HD. I recommend it to anyone who knows a little bit about editing pic.
B00F30S0Y0|4.0|This album is good. It is not great. There is too much filler and only a handful of standout tracks. Also, why is this a double CD? The combined run total could fit on one CD. I find that curious.<br /><br />Here is my list of top Arcade Fire albums:<br />1. The Suburbs - 5 Stars<br />2. Neon Bible - 5 Stars<br />3. Funeral - 4.5 Stars<br />4. Reflektor - 4 Stars
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|I am a huge Eminem fan, as always Eminem amused me with this new album...The lyrics, the mixture of sounds, it is just amazing!
B005ZB91KY|5.0|We loved this movie! Great story, good characters, good guy-bad guy, lots of action and good for the entire family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a very fun game. I love it! If you have a kindke fire, the graphics are amazing! However, the gane is still fun on your tablet or smartphone. The object of the game is to run away from the inspector while dodging obstacles. Overall, this is one of the best games, so buy it now!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Started playing this game....it's fun....additive, and just relaxing. It's a game that at any age it can be enjoyed. Kids will love the game too.
B000M5AJQI|4.0|good action movie with that keeps u intrigued right to the end grt for ppl who likes to keep guessing how it will end
0385537131|5.0|I loved this book!!  This was actually the first John Grisham book that I have ever read.  I got this as a gift for my birthday.  I would highly recommend it!
0316219266|3.0|The book is pretty good reading.  Obviously I shop at Amazon all the time so it was interesting to get to know the brains behind the operation.  My only complaint is that the book was cheaper at Costco!!!
B00ESF2772|3.0|It is a good book for children.  Dr.suess is a good writer.  And good at making my tounge numb.  I would strongly recomend this to anyone.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Very disappointed with how the author chose to end this book and trilogy. I wouldn't have read the series had I known how it would conclude. I've never been as unsatisfied with a book ending as I am with this one.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I love the Pendergast series and wait expectantly for each new book. Can't wait for the full book to be released.
B003WUYP56|4.0|Dr. Smolin (as well as several others) points out the problems that Physics confronts when it goes beyond the experimental and into purely philosophical areas. The way physics works today could be called the new age of faith and as such it strays from the tenants of science, where ideas and theories need proof by experiment. The string physicists are basically arguing about how many angels can dance on the surface of a photon and building new theories in several layers, on top of totally unproved ones, just because the math is beautiful.<br /><br />The only problem I find with the book is that it shows disenchantment, even bitterness, towards mainly string theorists (can you even say &#34;string experimentalists&#34;?) and probably his case would be much stronger without those personal feelings comming into the open.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is an easy, fun game that both my 7 year-old and my husband & I enjoy.  The premise is basic, and it's quick/easy to learn.  And it's not as scary or morbid as the packaging suggests.  We often include it in our Family Game Nights because it can go quickly, and is fun to play more than once in a row.  A great addition to your game collection!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|My 11 year old son loves this game.  It allows him to build rockets and attempt to land them.  It teaches him some about the physics involved.  It is simple to play, but enjoyable for him to play it over and over again.  I recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|on my kindle fire<br /><br />decent concept, bad delivery. temple run and subway suffers are better and were clearly made by better developers. (and I like Gameloft's other games)<br /><br />good:<br />-it's cute<br />-it gets gradually harder the longer you survive<br />-it's a rip off of temple run and subway surfers<br />-links to Facebook for a reward<br /><br />bad:<br />-it's a rip off of temple run and subway surfers<br />-links to Facebook for a reward<br />-it gets hard to switch between tilt and swipe controls for minigames and special sections<br />-goals are hard to achieve/require too much advancement in game<br />-Grub points (or whatever they are...the premium gold you buy) costs way are too high. you quickly and easily spend your only 50 points. especially if you don't know what you're doing<br />-lags occasionally during gameplay, especially when it's going super fast. (I'm not a sore loser, it actually does lag and cause you to die)<br />-little to no directions and goals are sometimes confusing -- took me forever to figure out that goals are what increase your multiplier, not the &quot;dispicable things&quot; you do during your run.<br />-too complicated

B0078XFYDA|3.0|It's just too simple if you have an engineering or scientific education. I would venture to say even well educated people will find that adds little to their knowledge of our universe. It's Ok for kids 14 - 18 years old and may even turn them into science.
B000W4E3OS|5.0|Recently purchased the complete Scriabin piano music performed by Maria Lettberg.  Eight CDs and one DVD, it is an essential purchase for Scriabin lovers, available at Amazon for an absolutely amazing $18.  Her performances show an excellent technique, and a great feel for the mysticism of the later works.  Compared to the only other complete set of his piano music, by Michael Ponti, she has a greater appreciation of the music, and doesn't treat the pieces as technical exercises like Ponti sometimes does, e.g., his ridiculously fast rendition of the 7th sonata.  Also, she clearly has lived with these pieces, Ponti admitted that many of his Scriabin recordings were little more than sight-reading.  However, she doesn't seem quite up to the level of Ponti's monster technique, even though she dispatches those parallel fourths in the 8th sonata with ease.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|If you like the Jurassic Park series you can't go wrong with the Blu-ray editions.  This has a nice collectable included, if you are not interested in this then just buy the BD copies.  Sound an picture are really nice and make the pictures more enjoyable.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Any Cher fan must buy thsi album. I played it in the car with a friend. My fifteen year old was in the car as well, and she asked me to play it agin what the last song finished. Cher is at her finest.
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|Every song but Jewels and Drugs appealed to me; it reminds me of club-hopping in the NYC subway. Very energetic, full of life. You can really tell she is becoming more of herself in this album.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Anyone who liked X-Files should love this series. It has compelling characters, a well thought out backstory, brillant actors and it just feels comfortable. Of course with any sci-fi series that take great chances you have to check your logic at the door but here you know that logic being well cared for and be returned to you buffed and shiny! So outlandish are some of the ideas I am tempted to call this a fantasy series but any series that bends time and space has to be expected to bend genres too.
B0024RIMBG|2.0|Where to begin?<br /><br />This dvd has all the great Irish classic songs like Shenandoah and Scarborough Faire.<br /><br />The music director has a truly great career ahead of him arranging elevator music. The music is sanitized of all the power of good Irish music in favour of cheesy staging that went out of style in the 1960's.<br /><br />The female backup singers appear to have been dressed in the winners from \\"Ireland's ugliest bridesmaid's dresses\\" competition.<br /><br />The female singers in this production are so very talented.  They deserve something better than this.
B00011KHTM|5.0|Weather you get this one or not, get one with a flexible cord between the laptop and vga cable.  This prevents the adapter from being unplugged from the laptop and is generally more gentle on the laptop connector.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Really nice copy in BD.  Good picture and sound. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys the Terminator series.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|I've always loved Forbidden Planet and am glad it's available in HD. The transfer looks very clean and the movie is timeless.

B008J8KBKY|1.0|Sorry, but I am just not in the mood to become a guinea pig beta tester for a marketing company that can't even be bothered to write a privacy policy before pushing their ad-ware on me that is barely disguised as a game. Thanks, but no thanks; not even as a free app of the day.<br /><br />Shame on you yet again, Amazon, for not only allowing stuff like this but for featuring it!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|If you are expecting another BORN THIS WAY then don't even bother with ARTPOP because all you'll do is complain about how it's not deep enough in it's messages and content. GAGA has been there and done that. And if you are expecting another FAME with radio dance hits such as \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"Bad Romance\\" then again you'll be very disappointed with ARTPOP.<br /><br />GAGA said this album was about feeling and that she wanted the music to be DJ/Club driven. So DJ White Shadow, ZEDD and MADEON have all turned GAGA's ARTPOP into electronic dance beat songs. So if you come into ARTPOP with that understanding you'll really enjoy this album from start to finish.<br /><br />The journey begins with \\"Aura\\" which is one of the most unique trippy pop songs you'll ever hear. I guarantee nobody else is putting out music like this in her genre. How can you not appreciate that? From the crazy guitar strings followed up GAGA's creative vocal chants and then you hear the electronic voice state what the album's intention will be-> SEX, DANCE, ARTPOP.<br /><br />It seems like the music that dominates the charts is either too moody or too sappy, so I am not sure if mainstream is really ready to embrace something like the follow up track \\"Venus\\".  The chorus is amazing and has a very ABBA sound to it and the lyrics are very basic but they work. They work so well that you don't even think about it.<br /><br />The rest of the album highlights her own self awareness and indulgence of her own art and the fame attached with it. Yet at the same time you get her strongest vocals to date and very catchy addicting choruses that will play over and over in your mind. Nothing wrong with that, we're just along for the ride.<br /><br />I do think songs like \\"Swine\\" and \\"Manicure\\" will be much more effective in her live performances. At their core they are solid rock songs and with more guitar, drums and piano they are just phenomenal. It's what made them SHINE so much at her ITUNES festival performance. I think the critic reviews might have been four stars all across the board if she hadn't gone the DJ influence route.<br /><br />So get ready for the ARTPOP BALL because I think that is when this record will really come alive and it will confirm again that GAGA is a better performance artist rather than a studio artist.<br /><br />All in all ARTPOP accomplishes what it set out to do. It doesn't take itself to seriously and you shouldn't either. Have fun with it, sing the songs along with her and feel the passion she's put into it.ce.

B002UM5BXW|3.0|First of all anybody who writes a book that I read cover to cover gets 3 stars.  Anthony Bourdain comes off as a brilliant despot who can cook but dictates his thoughts into a tape recorder and has a minion put it together for him. That is just my humble opinion
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an amazing book--the perspective from which it's written, the language used, all are different and effective at conveying a significant message.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Simple to setup, fast, intuitive, but only few apps released until now. When google allow more apps it will be perfect
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am so glad to have finally read this book. A great story told at a pace that keeps you wanting to keep reading. Some books have the tendency to drag on and on or to be too predictable. A good story to get in to if you're looking for a new series to start.
B000LB7G00|4.0|Works great, should be about 20 % heavier but otherwise love it.  Small profile fits my desk better, light source is very tech

B004P1JDJO|5.0|Excellent read confirming our instinct to release our employees and ourselves to be creative.  Stop structuring organizations to the detriment of the employee and long term survival of the company.  We are stuck in a culture that we have to control everything due to the 15% that seek to 'take' versus 'give' back to a 'we' culture.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was inspiring! I would recommend it for all teens. It helps you not only see from the point of view of someone who is attempting suicide but also some one who knows someone who is attempting. It is amazing and I rate it with 5 stars because it deserves it.

B000000OU0|5.0|one of the best albums ever made.  my son turned me on to this particular one.  always loved the eagles, but this brings it all together.  will not dissapoint.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|This game has it all! Stunning graphics, gripping storyline, not too many HO'S, and entertaining mini games. Strategy guide, hint &amp; skip buttons are all included! It is one of the better big fish games. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone but there is a horror element that I love.<br />Unfortunately, there are a lot of bugs. Several times the sound dies out especially during cut scenes where you need the volume. Many times you know where an item is in an HO scene but it wont allow you to click on it. A couple of times when trying to use an item, same thing...click click &amp; nothing.<br />While all of this is super irritating, it can be fixed. Simply exit out of the game &amp; then try again. Sometimes it takes 2-3 times. Normally I wouldn't play or recommend a game that had all of these bugs. This game is really good though! I think its well worth the bugs just to play the game. Without any bugs this would be a 5 star game. Even with the bugs it is a 4 star game. Try it out!

B00EP22QKG|3.0|On her first album in 19 years (Sorry....I'm not counting NAKED/SINNER, which was nothing more than a bunch of songs from various sessions over the previous decade pieced together into a wannabe album), Joan Jett finds herself at a crossroads. On the one hand, she's remained true to herself, deviating little from the sound last heard on 1994's PURE AND SIMPLE.<br />  On the other hand, during that almost-twenty-year gap, many of Jett's peers, including role models Suzi Quatro and Chrissie Hynde, proteges Pink and Avril Lavigne, and even former bandmate Lita Ford, have found a way to stretch their bounderies and try something new, while still implicitly remaining themselves.<br />  Sadly, there is very little about UNVARNISHED that could be considered \\"new.\\" In fact, at times it almost seems as if Jett has taken a giant step (or four) backwards. A lackluster, by-the-numbers vibe permeates much of the disc, as if Jett REALLY didn't want to do this, but was forced into it.<br />  Toss in all the hype over the \\"vulnerability\\" of such tracks as \\"Hard To Grow Up\\" and \\"Fragile\\" ~ cuts that don't really go ALL that deep ~ and you're kind of left scratching your head, going \\"Huh?!?\\" Even strong(er) cuts like \\"TMI\\", \\"Different\\" and the aforementioned \\"Fragile\\" suffer from hit and miss arragements that often bury Jett's vocal. (In all fairness ~ and honesty! ~ Jett's voice has not aged well, frequently falling flat).<br />  And, yet....I found the disc growing on me after my fifth or sixth listen. After a dozen or so...I gotta say, I did like it (This is actually a 3.5 star album, but I felt I had to round down vs. up). Yes, I still want more from Jett (and at 55 now, she certainly should be able to deliver it!), but (for now!) it's just good to have her back!<br />  Things kick off with the disc's first single, \\"Any Weather.\\" You would think a song co-written with Dave Grohl (arguably one of the most important rockers of the last quarter century!) would be a winner, but that's just not the case....the track is dull, dull, dull. Between the beyond basic arrangement, lackluster vocal and sophomoric lyrics, nothing works here. An ominous note to start things on.<br />  Ten times better is the biting \\"TMI.\\" With it's rumbling bassline and thundering percussion, this one packs a punch. I just wish that the buzzsaw guitars had been brought down a bit in the mix and Jett's vocal brought up....lyrics like \\"Hear all the rumors/The tumors/Yeah, they're growing in me/You make a fashion of passion/Make the scene to be seen\\" DESERVE to be heard! Very nice, but could have been even better.<br />  I'm on the fence when it comes to \\"Soulmates To Strangers.\\" The song is nothing new, certainly nothing we haven't heard before from Jett. But an insanely catchy melody and blistering vocal just get in your head and stay there. If there was more variety on the album, this track would have stood out more. As it is, it just kind of ends up getting lost in the mix.<br />  \\"Make It Back\\" fares even worse. Talk about a song that spins it's wheels! You have to be creative when it comes to playing just three chords, and that's just not the case here. Yes, I love the piano and harmony vocals, but the teenage poetry/empowerment lyrics?!? Ouch! The fact is, Jett's just too old for this kind of childish, beginner-level drivel. A major misfire.<br />  \\"Hard To Grow Up\\" is more of a gray area. You have to give Jett perks for trying to incorporate a little melody into the mix, as well as (sort of) opening up, but the whole thing lacks any real depth. Lines like \\"Just lost my Mom\\" and \\"But now my life is much more than a game\\" are casually tossed off, resulting in a song that means well but ultimately rings hollow. Too bad.<br />  \\"Fragile\\" fares much better. The lead vocal swoops and soars, while the lyrics aim right for the gut: \\"It's a thin string between life and death/She's close enough that I can feel her breath/A tenuous encampment/In this world/Spirit left her body/I'm still her little girl.\\" But it's the arrangement, particularly the Beatles-esque use of strings, that really elevates the track and blows you away. THIS is what Jett needs to be doing more of! Brilliant.<br />  Jett seems really dumbstruck over the ease with which one can obtain notoriety and/of infamy these days, dedicating not one, but two, songs to the topic. Both are strong, but I think \\"TMI\\" has a slight edge over \\"Reality Mentality.\\" That said, I do love the latter track's handclaps and lead vocal. And when Jett sings \\"It's demeaning/It's depleting\\"...well, you KNOW she means it!<br />  \\"Bad As We Can Be\\" is another step backwards. Truth be told, it's just not a very good song. With almost 40 years in the industry under her belt now, Jett should be able to offer up stronger material than this. This kind of throwaway cut was O.K. in her twenties and thirties, but in her mid-fifties? Uh-uh...no way. (Heck, even a great cover would have been better here!).<br />  The album ends, however, on a very strong note, dabbling with tones, flavors and ideas Jett would be wise to persue in the future. \\"Different\\" is all percussive and tribal (love the cowbell!), proving Jett CAN shake things up. I would totally dig seeing her play around with bass riffs, more percussive bits and horn parts..please!<br />  But back to \\"Different\\"....there's just something infectious about this wise ode to individuality. Favorite line? \\"And age is not in years/It sits between your ears.\\" One of UNVARNISHED's finest moments.<br />  Closing things out is the bluesy \\"Everybody Needs A Hero.\\" This stripped down peak into the soul of Joan Jett is the only real \\"unvarnished\\" moment on UNVARNISHED...the strong lead vocal and sincere lyrics are supported by the sublime arrangement, which is a nice change....on the majority of the rest of the album, arrangement and vocal are often battling each other for the spotlight. Yet another winner.<br />  So where does Joan Jett go from here? Well, I certainly don't want to see her in a rocking chair, strumming an acoustic guitar, crooning folk songs. At the same time, I don't want to see her become a parody of herself...a sixty year old woman pretending to be twenty, travelling the greatest hits circuit. Jett is now entering elderstateswoman status....she needs to take what she's learned over the last almost four decades and REALLY put it to good use. In it's best moments, UNVARNISHED proves that she's more than capable of doing just that. (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).I'm still her little girl.\\" But it's the arrangement, particularly the Beatles-esque use of strings, that really elevates the track and blows you away. THIS is what Jett needs to be doing more of!

(Heck, even a great cover would have been better here!).<br />  The album ends, however, on a very strong note, dabbling with tones, flavors and ideas Jett would be wise to persue in the future. \\"Different\\" is all percussive and tribal (love the cowbell!), proving Jett CAN shake things up. I would totally dig seeing her play around with bass riffs, more percussive bits and horn parts..please!<br />  But back to \\"Different\\"....there's just something infectious about this wise ode to individuality. Favorite line? \\"And age is not in years/It sits between your ears.\\" One of UNVARNISHED's finest moments.<br />  Closing things out is the bluesy \\"Everybody Needs A Hero.\\" This stripped down peak into the soul of Joan Jett is the only real \\"unvarnished\\" moment on UNVARNISHED...the strong lead vocal and sincere lyrics are supported by the sublime arrangement, which is a nice change....on the majority of the rest of the album, arrangement and vocal are often battling each other for the spotlight. Yet another winner.<br />  So where does Joan Jett go from here? Well, I certainly don't want to see her in a rocking chair, strumming an acoustic guitar, crooning folk songs. At the same time, I don't want to see her become a parody of herself...a sixty year old woman pretending to be twenty, travelling the greatest hits circuit. Jett is now entering elderstateswoman status....she needs to take what she's learned over the last almost four decades and REALLY put it to good use. In it's best moments, UNVARNISHED proves that she's more than capable of doing just that. (As with all my reviews, I'm docking the disc half a star for not including the lyrics).
1609611543|3.0|I bought this and the related cookbook. Actually, the cookbook has enough of the science and theory in its front section to cover the needs of most people. I wish I had just gone with the cookbook, but that's one of the hazards of buying online.
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|Great CPU for what it does.  If you want to do anything cpu intensive like a security camera system, this is not a good choice.  It will rapp all 4 cores out with Blue Iris.  Other than that, it works great.  Plays WoW just fine etc.  I am powering two monitors and couldn't be happier for the budget I set.
B00F2VHERE|5.0|Rudolf Buchbinder is one of the foremost pianists of our time. His compelling and inspired versions of the classical-romantic masterpieces have earned him a worldwide esteem among music lovers and critics alike. Spanning a half-century, his career has entitled him to approach music from a very authoritative point of view. Moreover, in good Viennese tradition, Buchbinder assumes sometimes the double posture as soloist and conductor. It is the case here, where the Austrian musician leads from the keyboard the famous Vienna Philharmonic in the complete cycle of Beethoven piano concertos. Recorded live in two consecutive days, these wonderful CDs testify Buchbinder's magisterial command of the keyboard and his unimpeachable stylistic insight with respect to this music.<br /><br />As a personal note, I must add that Buchbinder performed the same program recently in Bucharest (September 2013) during the \\"George Enescu\\" International Festival, this time accompanied by the \\"George Enescu\\" Philharmonic. His thrilling performance blown the roof at the Romanian Athenee such thundering and enthusiast the standing ovations were. As a member of the audience on that occasion, I decided instantly to buy this CD-box set and I am delighted to cherish this way those special moments by repeated listening to them.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, a five stars recording!

B00F35B8F8|1.0|This is the first time I ordered a video on demand from Amazon.  I spent extra to get the HD download and the picture quality was terrible.  I watch old movies on Netflix all the time and the pic quality was way better than this brand new movie...I am very disappointed in my download experience....movie was great by the way but I am sure I missed a lot!
0811879542|5.0|Great interactive without being connected to a computer. Fun for the child and the adult who's fortunate enough to have a little one sitting on their lap to share it with. GREAT!!!
B002UD56I6|5.0|The disc is a great last tribute to my personal choice of the best all around entertainer of all time. There is no one out today who has the over-all talent of the King of Pop, MR. Michael Jackson.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun! You will love it forever and always. It gets tricky but, you'll get the hang of it!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Gripping.  Intriguing flashbacks.  Thought provoking.  A great read.  I loved the ending.  I was not really surprised.  It was very clever.  An interesting look at family dynamics and the judicial system.
