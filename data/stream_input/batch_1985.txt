1481251880|5.0|This story deals with an issue so abborhent in our society - but the love story surrounding this will leave you thinking about Sky and Holder for a long time.  I dare you not to fall in love with Holder - I hope my teenage girls find a man just like him.  All the fantastic reviews can't be wrong - buy this book and be prepared to get no sleep until you finish it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really like this app. I store everything in it, websites, pics, and anything else I need 2 store. If u need a good note pad app try this one you'll like it.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Boring! Same thing over and over again. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Don't waste your money. - Very badly written.
0345803485|5.0|Nothing intellectual here, just fast reading with a lot of adult content. A lot of fun! But do not read this unless you have the second book handy.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|An amazing movie about time travel you have to think about.  The ending was awesome.  The story was great.  I loved that it isn't a typical \\"hollywood\\" closure.
1593082045|5.0|I haven't read it yet but have not been disappointed yet in the Barnes & Noble Classic series. I have Vol 1 as well.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Wow.  An amazing movie that paid homage to so many of the comic books we all grew up with.  Nolan took our childhood dreams and made them reality on the big screen.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|It's a beautiful presentation of the 13 Beatles albums produced in the UK as they were intended.  It is a great collector's item if you a Beatles fan. I am very happy with it.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I love what Marvel has done here.  You have to see the individual movies about each of the characters first.  Having seen them, you'll have the back ground to watch the Avengers.  One of the best movies of all time.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Loved this movie, it was a great mix of music generations. The acting was great. At first I didn't think I would like it, but give it 10 minutes, and you'll be hooked.<br />Not for the under 13 crowd.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game app is so addicting based on the adrenaline of beating your own your score and receiving the rewards and getting the swords. really like it
B009G78EE2|5.0|Poetry, depth, love, hate, and so many more words come to mind.<br />Rap, no - Poetry, pure poetry.<br />Like a better, more genuine, mature Eminem that's discovered R&B.<br /><br />A pleasure to listen to.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I bought this app and it's great!<br /><br />The display is big and super crisp, and entering fractions couldn't be more intuitive.<br /><br />Great for checking fraction homework, working with mixed numbers,improper fractions and reducing fractions.<br /><br />Note that it doesn't do decimal fractions - in the current version, entering 1/2 won't convert to .5, or vice-versa if your work requires decimal equivalents.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a good game but can be annoying when you try to click on a building and a car driving by comes up instead.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase! Hubby was even happier that I got this for him! A plus plus
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not quite finished yet. But as all Nicholas sparks books go, I can't put it down and I'm in love with the plot line.

B0053O89Z6|5.0|Arrived on time, some of the brackets holding the disc in place were broken, but the discs themselves are fine. Overall, no complaints.
B008J34466|4.0|This is a good CD. A couple of songs I'm not crazy about but overall I'm glad I purchased it! Her Fun House CD is still my favorite I think.
B00006LJ72|5.0|this boxed set screams a perfect 10! 4 cds of masterpieces! wow! very intriguing and incredible! mystical and magical. like in an endless dream.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful setting.  Brilliant performances.  Engaging storyline.  Well worth the investment! Highly recommended if you enjoy the history of England during the early 1900s and the evolution of the class system.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|cant expand park without actually paying money for 'peanuts' -  kinda bummin for a free app to keep busy  not free in the long run
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This series is able to capture so many of the nuances of the era.  The writing is spectacular and the acting is accomplished.  Well worth watching if you are interested in times past or want to know more about what it was like for men and women both in the home and in the workplace during the 50s/60s generation.  Difficult to believe if you have not experienced this yourself, but so much of it, even though it is condensed to time bites, is dead on!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can say that I really enjoy and like this book. I read it in 1 day. This is definately one of my favorite book. I expect one day someone may put in a movie. Good drama and a beatiful love.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to you was a great book!!! Similar to 50 shades in the sense that the relationship featured in the book is up and down, very sexual, and romantic. The book is well written and draws you in from the first chapter. The story is great and your instantly hooked! I have recommended this book to all my friends and I'm waiting rather impatiently for the 3rd book in the series to come out!
B0083Z614S|5.0|Great book a secret garden indeed 5 star rating<br />Kept you wanting to get to the end to see what was going to happened. The secret garden
145210655X|5.0|This book was purchased as a gift for someone and he absolutely loved it.  I read it too and it's the funniest book.  I see the author is coming out with another book in a few months, I will be purchasing it for sure!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I enjoy watching Castle on TV so. I was drawn to his books. This was a interesting mystery with a good plot and plenty of action. I think mystery readers every where would like this book.

B005FISBTO|3.0|Dexter I haven't watch it since last year kind of lost interset just don't think it is as good anymore
0062200909|5.0|I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my brother, who has been a Lord of the Rings fan since the books were first published. I didn't get a chance to read all of the book - didn't want it to look used when he got it! But, at the same time, I wanted to see what it was like. It is beautifully illustrated,and the book itself is very high quality. the covers are think and textured, and it is a nice size. I read the introduction, and some of the text. I want to buy the book for myself eventually. This is a book describing, with words and illustrations, the many details that went into the making of the movie &#34;The Hobit:An Unexpected Journey&#34;. It is fascinating to learn to what extreme lengths Peter Jackson and his crew went to make the ultimate film resemble his vision. Anyone interested in the making of a film of this scope and precision would be bound to love this volume.
1400052181|4.0|Very eye-opening.  Ever changing and controversial opinions about human tissue research. Much ethical debate on informed consert.  The shame of the story is that the Lacks family had to wait so long to know and understand what had been done with Henrietta's tissue and cells.
0061537969|5.0|I have purchased this book at least seven times as gifts.  Not one person didn't love it and now they're doing the same.<br /><br />A beautiful and beautifully written story.  Bravo!
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Just gotta say, i love this movie. things might start out slow, but its worth watching. Goes on my favorite movie list. If you are a fan of any ghost/horror movie definantly watch this
B007HACDLK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the read.  I've read all of Flynn's books.  If you're a Brad Thor fan, try Vince Flynn, too.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|It's so unfair that Amazon kept charging per episode. I kept having to purchase the next in the series because I needed to know what was going to happen. Amazon, \\"you suck!\\"
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey makes me laugh out loud.  I had to stop reading this at work during lunch because people kept popping into my office to learn what was so funny.  I told them to buy the book.<br /><br />This book was a little slower than DeMille's usual pace.  However, if you're a John Corey fan, it's still worth the price and time.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Patti Smith wrote this book.  She did not have a ghost writer.  What I found amazing was the fact that I had always thought of her as &#34;just&#34; a rock star.  But as she writes her memoir I discovered that she started out penniless and became a writer of poetry.  When she met Robert Maplethorpe she was also an artist and definitely Maplethorpe's muse.  It was only later in her late 20's that she developed a singing career along with writing lyrics to her ballades and songs.  But this book is less about Patti Smith's music career and more about her deep and lasting friendship with Robert Maplethorpe.  Patti Smith writes so beautifully which is not a suprise when I learned of her interest in literature.  She has a command of the English language that such that she paints pictures with words.  This book tugged at my heartstrings.  Smith depicts the complex nature of Robert Maplethorpe and the deep  and lasting relationship and loyalty they shared as lovers and friends.  I highly recommend this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was a great love story.  I could not put it down.  I read through the night to finish it.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|This is an easy diet to follow and it makes sense.  Dr. Dukan delivers in depth an explaination of how and why the diet works.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So good and so real. Would recommend to anyone over 16 due to mature content. Now on to read Slammed!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Good quality picture on my pc.  No commercial interuptions or stopping of the show.  Really enjoy the show all in all.
B002JC9RMY|2.0|If you're are fan of dragonball or DBZ, you will hate this movie. If you are a fan of movies, you will also hate this movie.<br />I rented this out of morbid curiosity. After watching it, I realize how sick I really am.<br />Avoid this movie.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This is the best app I have ever gotten from the app store.<br />Instead of 64 in a slot in Minecraft, you can have 255.<br />You can change dirt into diamonds!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It was a good read with interesting turn of events. I can't wait to read the last book and see the movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app because you get diamonds & you can turn them into diamond blocks.<br />My mom thinks this is a strange app....she gets sick watching me play!<br />You can make weapons & pickaxes!!!
0316228532|3.0|To be frank, I was impressed by the complex and true-to-life characters but disappointed in the plot.  I think Rowling has perfected the art of third person omniscient, of which I am a huge fan.  However, I found the book dry, long, and boring... yet still worth reading.  So, three stars.  I look forward to her next book.  The HP books have brilliant plots, so I know she's got it in her.  Maybe her next work will have the best of both worlds.
B009329ZF2|3.0|The movie was fun to watch the first time.  Obviously very formulaic pushing all the buttons that we have been conditioned to respond to, such as respect for the military, old vets, disabled vets, the flag, alien invaders, wild child redeemed, yada yada yada.  I am surprised there weren't any puppies in the movie.  Watching it the second time I fell asleep. Way too predictable.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Good service and price arrive timely and in great shape. Given as a gift for the Holidays.  They enjoyed it
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Great songs. If you like leonard Cohen. You  will like listening to this album. Most of his greats are on here.<br />Good live performance.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I have read the books and  was impressed with the filming of same.  Don't know how they did alot of the scenes but I think they followed the book very closely.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game.. Im a big Zelda fan and this reminds me of the old school dungeons.  I could spend plenty of time playing this!
B005LAIISA|5.0|I enjoy all of these movies and look forward to more of the same.  Keep up the good work  for more funny episodes.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|My daughter loves the real piano so we got this app.  It is exactly what we were looking for to play on the fly~!
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I loved reading Bared to u and Reflected in u. Can't wait to read d other part of d trilogy. Waiting with anticipation..........
B004P12SSW|5.0|Good movie, great singing and dancing.  Would highly recommend if you like musicals.  Story line not bad either.  Great for Kindle.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Won't spoil the end for you but don't  think you'll be shocked if you've read other Grisham books.  This book had all the strengths and shortcomings of his other work:  easy and fun to read, somewhat sexist, twist at end.  As a lawyer I enjoy his cynical/realistic take on the legal system.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|Hard to take pictures from rear and have found nothing to delete pictures you don't want.  Would not recommend to anyone, waste of money, will probably end up deteting it, at least I hope it can be deleted.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|very entertaining as a beach read but plot was reaching and far fetched even for Grisham.  But I did enjoy it.
B008476HBM|5.0|Great timeless romance! Looking forward to reading another Jane Austen book. I anticipated a happy ending and she delivered. Thanks
B004DM0UII|5.0|Much better that any other Player that I have installed. This one just works.<br /><br />Although, I still need a way to turn it off without having to unlock the phone each time.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I'm having problems with starting a plan the button isn't letting me start one. If anyone knows how to fix it please let me know.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|My son wanted this for Christmas and it was excactly what I expected. Thank you so much for a great purchase
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This was Great dictionary and very helpful for high school English, History, & Science!<br />I would recommend this for anyone who has a kindle and needs an easy way to look up words and fast!
1419705849|5.0|my son loves it,  he red it all in one day. A 6 year old will  enjoy this book, Good book
B00979CS50|3.0|I got this CD for Christmas and finally had time to give it a listen.  I have been a Neil Young fan since the late 60's. As a matter of fact he is the first performer I saw in concert when I was a teenager.  I have always liked his long, rambling jams and there are some good songs on here that fit that criteria.  But I felt the words were a little too repetitious and just did not stack up against so many other Neil Young songs that I love.  It reminds me of current pop songs, but maybe that's why Neil wrote the songs this way because much of the CD was an indictment against the state of music today. I will continue to listen to this, but it definitely doesn't rate as one of my favorite Neil Young CD's.
0765325950|5.0|Wow. I just sped through this over the weekend, because I couldn't imagine trying to read it on my lunches at work, and I would have HAD to. The book is an amazing conclusion to THE epic fantasy trilogy of the past 50 years. A conclusion I never thought I would get to read, and one that I am SO happy that I did. I'll review only in broad generalities so as not to give anything away...<br /><br />I got teary eyed at one point, I swore out loud at the author at another where a favorite character died at another, and I spent the final hour reading with a big grin on my face. There are some excellent twists, Brandon Sanderson writes epic battle scenes, and the characters pretty much all get their due. The conclusion was not perfect (really, it couldn't have been), but it WAS right. It ended the way it should have, and it got to the ending in ways I never expected. There are deaths that made me sad, but there were moments of heroism and redemption which were truly wonderful as well. I'm sure there are plot threads that didn't get wrapped up or at least addressed, but I still can't think of any. The author seems to have given each beloved character a moment that is truly their own, which I absolutely loved.<br /><br />If you loved the series, you will love this book. The vast majority of the negative reviews for this book are \\"revenge\\" by people who feel cheated that the ebook will be delayed several months. Right or wrong, I think that reviewing a policy rather than the book is unfair...and that any Jordan fan who reads the book will be happy that they did.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I found this book a wonderful tale. The only problem that I have now is finding another book that has the quality of writing style and story to match. My Gosh this tale took me away on a journey that I would like to experience again. I have recommended this to all my friends who appreciate quality.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|The 3 stars i gave this product is for the bluray, not the movie itself. I highly enjoyed the movie. Filled with action and suspense, but the bluray itself is rather lackluster. In by that i mean the special features. Now both the first and second trailers for the movie are included on the bluray, the extras are pretty short. they have on location stuff, and some behind the scenes stuff, but nothing like casino royale bluray. the extras here dont last more than 6min in length. there are a few producers/directors stuff, but nothing in comparison like the extras in Casino Royale. so if your looking for a chockfull of extras, be warned that there really isnt much here. but if your looking for a great action flick, this is one to get, as well as its predecessor Casino Royale since this is part 2 of that first movie.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The book has been an eye-opener.  Although I have to lookup quite a few words, I am learning more about French history and Waterloo.  I wish I had read the book earlier in life.  What great writing. I saw the play, watched the movie and then read the book. Better to do them in the opposite order.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I learned so much about things that occur behind the scenes.  Very interesting how the presidents interact with each other.  I could not put the book down.
B00633W614|3.0|it's okay.  perhaps first reading &#34;only time will tell&#34; by J. Archer would make this reading better than just okay.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very entertaining.  I didn't want to put it down.  The sex was very graphic, almost to much.  I'm going to start number 3 immediately.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This was a fabulous read. I look forward to the next two books in the trilogy.<br />I often paused and looked up historical references. This book hooked me in the opening pages.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Totally blown away by this movie. There was never a boring moment, even though it is about 2 hours long it never seems like it. You totally get caught up in the movie, due in large part to the great dialog and acting. The CGI is top notch also which is always great because it helps to keep you immersed in the movie.<br /><br />The action in this movie is insane. Once it starts it never stops. There are plenty of great explosions, and fighting scenes. If you are a fan of Battle Los Angeles you are guaranteed to love this movie. My favorite part is when the Veterans step up, you can feel the pride and love for their country, and that is due to them using actual Veterans.<br /><br />This is a must see, must buy movie. That's right don't rent, buy it, cause trust me you are going to want to see it again and again!
B006WXHJNU|5.0|Gotta love the Hulk! I used to watch the tv series &#34;The Incredible Hulk&#34; as a child, and the movies that have come out. But this is by far the best one yet. I love the humor they have mixed in with the story line. 5 stars!!!!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|Before I saw this I thought it would be your typical girly cheesy movie, but I found out otherwise.  This movie is great.  It has great music and a truly talented cast.  It has clever comedy that adults can appreciate, not just teenage girls.  Rebel Wilson is spot on.  I saw this in the theater, and by the end everyone was yelling and cheering the fictional characters on out loud and clapped when it was over, including myself.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|A little hard to follow, but otherwise okay.  Our son wanted to watch it, so we agreed.  Love Bruce Willis!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app it is so addicting and fun if I could give it 300 stars I WOULD! I reccomend this app<br /><br />Fruit Ninja
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|It is not easy to write about history if one has not lived in the moment, since what one writes is colored by the opinions of others. It is even more difficult to write historical fiction based on events that were some of the most momentous in the last eighty odd years.<br /><br />Christoph Fischer pulls it off in The Luck of the Weissenteiners.<br /><br />This is the story of Greta Weissensteiner and the Weissensteiner family,  a Jewish family in Bratislava in war torn Europe. The scope of the book is immense, covering Bratislava in the 1930s to Germany after the World War. The characters' looming sense of dread in the build up to the war and how they navigate life during the war is real, palpable and believable. Fischer avoids the easy tear jerking sentimentality often used by lesser writers when narrating tales of Jews in the Second World War. His sparse prose hammers home that shameful period in history that much more effectively.<br /><br />The Luck of the Weissensteiners is the tale of a family. But it is also a tale about us. About some of us being evil, some of us cowards, some of us brave, but most of us innately good.<br /><br />Francis Bacon said some books are to be tasted, some to be swallowed... The Luck of the Weissensteiners is to be chewed and digested.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! It is so challenging and fun it could be a school activity.......the fun ones!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I totally recommend this app!
B00AECDDYY|5.0|5 stars for fun and playability. Thank you for the great job. I would highly reccomend this one. Nineteen twenty!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I usually love John Grisham's writing, but had some disappointment with this book.  I was &#34;all in&#34; through most of it.  I was disturbed by the manipulative and cavilier way the &#34;racketeer&#34; used the real killer, maybe because I don't believe one wrong okays another.  Moral belief does affect the way one receives even fiction.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does what it promises. I haven't noticed any bugs or quirks. I'm using this on my Kindle HD.
B009AHWLHE|4.0|It was a really decent film, but It just feels so incomplete. But it's still good. I highly recommend it!
1449410243|4.0|This book was very funny and well written.  There were subjects in it that fit our cat to a &#34;T&#34;.  I recommend it for a good laugh.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Incredibly wonderful story & acting.  Never quite knew which direction the movie would go in next and did not predict the ending. This is definitely one for the collection shelves. So unique and fascinating.
0316069434|5.0|My husband received this as a Christmas gift and thoroughly enjoyed every second of happy reading. He named it one of the author's best.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Unique story, Plenty of good laughs. Listening to the voice of &#34;Peter from Family Guy&#34; as Ted made it difficult to see Ted as his own character. I think they should have used a different actor for that part. Well done movie but over all my feeling was... eh.<br />I expected laughter from beginning to end based on people's recommendations but the voice issue was really the con for me.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I loved this movie.  If you like all the british actors in this movie then you will love it. Wonderful story and acting.
0930289234|5.0|One of the greatest if not THE greatest graphic novels made so far. Truly a masterpiece in it's own right.
B009CMZAES|4.0|First of all:  I loved it and I finished the whole book in one weekend.  After the first few dozen pages of character development, it really grabbed me and I couldn't put it down.  The story, although simple in its basic concept, is great and the many twists make for really interesting reading.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?  While some of the reasons why people live like they do in this book are well described and make logical sense (eventually), some other details don't make sense and are highly improbable.  I understand that this is a fiction novel, but since it is based on the basic concepts of communities living together and evolution, it bothered me that some of the ways people go about their lives and especially the use of technology, is so ....how should I say it...\\"un-adventurous\\"(?)
B008QTV3X0|5.0|What makes this show great are the deeply drawn characters; their flaws, their motivations, their humanity.  These aren't perfect agents going after terrorists or cartoon terrorists trying to destroy America.  On both sides of the issue, you see the humanity of the characters; each side displays brutality and altruism, which makes the show much more complex and satisfying.
B00884GR0W|5.0|What more is there to say, you dig up blocks of several types of stuff and then build with them. Forge stuff from other stuff. Forge weapons and tools to fight things and get stuff. Dig down and get stuff. Build up to get other stuff. And at night, panic in the dark by mining stuff until you see stuff that glows so you can see other stuff. See people who build and sell stuff for the price of stuff. If you like stuff, this game is for you! I like stuff.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started reading this book not knowing what to expect.  It left me speechless.  I felt every single emotion when I read this book from butterflies to complete sadness.  And just when I think I know what's going to happen next, it takes me completely by surprise.  This book does deal with very mature topics which are hard for anyone to talk about, let alone deal with.  As hard as some parts were to read, I still think this is one of the best books I've read.  I loved the authors style and I felt she stayed very true to the characters.
B000E6FSPW|5.0|GREAT CD AND GREAT MOVIE I GIVE IT 5 STARS. IT IS A MUST HAVE.I HEARD THIS AND I HAD TO HAVE IT.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|This is a good App to keep an eye on what is going with things you are watching, bidding on, or selling at eBay.  However somethings are not as user friendly. On more details it says you must be signed in to see this even when you are signed in, I'm not sure if it is a bug that needs to be fixed in the software or not.  All in all not bad to keep an eye on things or add things you may want to bid on...but I would wait to bid on until you can get your actual computer.  I access this App from an Amazon Kindle Fire HD.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is very addictive I prefer to all the dragon lovers out there and this game takes a lot of patients
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Okay, um I am a little shocked and scared. Holy cow. Ugh what happened to Gale???? I am so confused what an odd ending? I'm still mulling over it
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Kinda of fun, but not really free, there is a cost to upgrade. Requires hand coordination. Great game for kids
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Beautiful book .so many emotional roller coasters.Great middle and ending .loved it.the characters were so colorful and real great storytelling.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This product works as advertised and more. It worked it is supposed to in no time. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
B001FOPODS|5.0|Perfect . Im a huge fan of stop motion<br />And peter and the wolf .<br />Kept origional story but added stuff in .<br />Had wit and charm .<br />SPOILER if you have see  the edited version of<br />Peter and the wolf DISNEY . The duck somehow<br />Is alive at the end . Well the wolf eats the duck<br />And there are some other parts of the movie that<br />Make peter seem to be more of a missunderstood<br />Boy who gets picked on . He doesnt seem the<br />Hunter type in this . And does a strange thing<br />Some wouldnt expect at the end of the movie<br />Yes remember the movies like 15 minutes i watch it<br />Over and pver put the movie on repeat .<br />And also no talking whatsoever naration nope nada<br />The most majestic wolf song ever I LOVE THE WOLF's<br />SONG its crazy beautiful .<br /><br />The end
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|starts strong but fizzles towards the end; The ending is completely unrealistic and looks like it is just hacked together to get it done
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Best movie ive seen besides les mis out of<br />2012.<br />Emotionally moving .true story . Made you laugh.<br />Plot was great .always guessing .not typical i<br />Adore this movie and of course pre-ordered it<br /> . I new i was going to buy it while watching it the first time<br />like during the<br />Middle of the movie . i could say<br />The best story of friendship i have seen<br />And when the story is this good and you can only<br />Understand english all the foreign-ness<br /> goes away you<br />Read the subtitles fluidly it is no problem if you<br />Are not used to subtitles .

B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This is a great movie with typical Jerry Seinfield humor.  I watched it with my grandchildren and we all enjoyed it a lot.
1936608898|5.0|I am a 55 year old man who has worked out 4-5 times per week for the last 12 years. I followed the conventional wisdom of eating every three hours, loading up with soy, whole grains and avoiding meat, eggs, etc. I was hungry all the time, and as I got older It became harder and harder to maintain my lean mass and keep my body fat down. I was doing more and more cardio on top of the 45 min. to 1 hr weight training sessions to no avail. A friend of mine told me about this book, not only does it tell you what to do,it gives you the science behind it! Since I began this program 2 months ago, I have dropped 2 inches off my waist, 3% body fat reduction, no loss of lean mass! I rarely do any cardio because I am burning fat now instead of sugar and carbs! I eat 3 times a day and sometimes don't get hungry for 5-6 hours. I guarantee that if you follow the principles in this book you will be leaner and healthier with LESS EFFORT!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Beautifully filmed but the story lacks direction, originality and most of all the hook to keep you interested and thoroughly involved.

B006K2WXOI|5.0|I can relate to the hero boy. I remember my first doubting Christmas and Santa. I always slept with a lighted \\"big ben\\" clock ticking away as I waited to hear Santa's Reindeer on the roof. All of the story is my  childhood at Christmas. The author is writing about my memories and it is so special to share with my nieces and nephews. It has become tradition. The Polar Express is classic Christmas!

B00APUYWYA|2.0|I was hoping for a nice chick flick, but this was boring and did not flow well. The only thing that made this bearable was the fact that the people in the movie could actually sing, and Fat Amy was pretty funny.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I love this movie and can not get enough of the Final Fantasy 7 world!  This is one of the best movies in my opinion.
B00884GR0W|1.0|The first and most serious problem is that The game just quit and disappeared right in the middle of playing. I found myself right back at my apps screen. this happened a few times.<br /><br />The second thing is when I open the game, someone thought it would be a good idea to put that America hating Korean idiot's picture there while the game is loading???  I feel that is VERY offensive!!! This game is uninstalled, and no other games from this developer will ever be considered.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Simple, straightforward advice on what works. Simple strategies--keep a clear focus on your need, don't put off profitability, keep yourself lean until you absolutely must expand--but elegantly explained. A lot of folks can tell you how other companies do business, not if they do it right or not. This focuses on what works, what makes sense, and what you should care most about when starting your own business.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book makes you feel like you are there every step of the way. You feel as if you are Emily or Chris. You can feel the agonizing pain and grief of the parents. Great book!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Fans of taught espionage thrillers won't be satisfied, but this finely-drawn character study, about the hamfisted efforts of Cold War stalwarts to get involved in the loftier arts, contains a living, feeling piece of art at the center, Serena Frome. She's believable, mostly likeable, realistic and most of all, fun to read about. As a good piece about being tricky to writers should be, it's got some excellent literary/writerly turns in it, and a satisfying wrap-up.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Ridiculously fun....certainly something I never thought I'd be doing!  Good way to pass some time; fun having competitions with others playing it as well.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|my son and I watched it together and I'm not sure if the sound of his laughter made me smile more or the movie. Great film!

B00992CF6W|4.0|After reading nothing but positive reviews I decided try it out. Its a lot of fun and you can build  lot. The only thigs I don't like about it is that you can't fly high (or I haven't figured out how to) and you can't create things likea bucket (or again I haven't figured out how.But despite those small things I woul  totally recommend it.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Movie is a classic. I gave it to my son as a gift. he had been looking for it for quite a while. He was very pleased indeed. Thank You.

0810988933|4.0|It was hilarious most of the times. Greg Heffley's voice as a youngster entering middle school is quite convincing and genuine. Also, his insecurities and conflicts, dealt with in a humurous tone, are credible and enjoyable. In this first tome, Greg starts 6th grade, has conflicts with his parents, has adventures with his new friend Rowley, runs for school treasurer, has a Halloween adventure, joins a Christmas play, makes a comic strip, becomes a school patroller, and strives often to become a popular student. Greg belongs to the canon of comic strip figures or cartoon characters like Charlie Brown or Bart Simpson. Written in a language which mirrors the way kids speak, but with humor added to it, Mr. Kinney has done a stupendous work at appealing to young audiences.<br /><br />I bought it precisely because I saw some of my 7th graders reading it, and while I read it I was looking for school material. One may flesh out literary, vocabulary, grammatical, and reading comprehension skills from this text. The language is accessible, there are lots of idioms, funny pictures, and experiences that kids may relate to in one way or another. In sum, they may encourage kids to read.
B0045KS6M0|1.0|I could not play my movie on my MacBook Pro. They said my adobe player was out of date , then updated it , but could not play my movie anyway.I thought I could download the movie into my iTunes library with my other movies, but I was not successful.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|As a Blade Runner fan, I appreciate and enjoy Scott's final cut on this great sci-fi/noir film. I also had the previous version, the director's cut, and I can tell there is an outstanding improvement in this final cut. The image is very clear, the lighting effects literally jump out of the screen, and a few extra scenes are added to it that make the film more visually stimulating. The digital restoration is A+. The story and its mood doesn't change a bit. I certainly enjoy this one over and over.
B008IGP8RI|5.0|So my wife says. She won't bring it home for me to listen too. She likes it so much. Guess I will have to wait.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Very entertaining and suspensful book. Overall a good read and very well written, however the ending will leave you wanting more!
044024367X|3.0|I have read a few reviews of Nothing to Lose on Amazon and they seem pretty negative.  I'll be up front.  This was not the best Jack Reacher novel I have read.  I loved One Shot, 61 Hours and Worth Dying For.  Nothing to Lose sits below those.  The plot development is really strong.  Lee Child builds a strong narrative largely on suspense and mis-direction.  However, the resolution is a little too 'and then this happened, the end'.  The whole Hope and Despair angle was clever.  I also thought the hidden secret or plot twist was good too.<br /><br />Some people have criticised the supposed anti-war angle of Nothing to Lose, with some people saying Reacher is apolitical.  This may be the case, but Reacher is less than gushing about war and what happens in war in pretty much every other novel.  Hence, I think there might be some right wing Fox News loving review writers having a crack at Nothing to Lose, simply because it explores the casualty of war angle a little more than some other novels.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|And he really loves the Beach Boys, as do I, because we grew up with them.  It's all about the harmonies for us.  He wasn't overly thrilled with the new direction the music goes in, but that could be because we are extremely happy with their past harmonies and that type of music.  The BB's are NEVER bad!
0385344333|3.0|I know Jack Reacher has been around for quite some time and I have come late to the party.  However I have read half of the Jack Reacher novels and I have to say this one is quite a let down.  I don't want to give away the plot so I will keep this brief.  About half the book has Reacher sitting in a car pondering what he should do.  It what it would like watching a Jason Statham movie where Statham sits in a chair for 50 minutes and then says 'hey time to kick some ass'.  I love readin Reachers internal thoughts and calculations, but even that seemed to be missing.  There is an interesting plot device using an undercover operation inside an undercover operation, which could have been allowed to play out further at the expense of all the time Reacher is sitting in a car.<br /><br />I also picked up a little snarking go at David Baldacci, who gave us the Jack Reacher clone John Puller.  A Wanted Man includes an overweight and stupid sheriff's dputy called Puller.  With Puller italices the first couple of times the name is mentioned.  Not subtle Lee Child.  While you are correct Zero Day and and The Forgotten a not a patch on any Jack Reacher novel, neither is A Wanted Man.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|One of his best!  Caught me from the beginning.  Have enjoyed the Reacher series and it was neat to see it on the big screen.

1451648537|5.0|A fiction fanatic, this is the first biography I have ever read and I was up until 3am for about a week every night reading it.  If this is what all biographies are like then I obviously haven't lived yet.  I never really knew much about Steve Jobs except that he was CEO of Apple, that he and Bill Gates began the computer industry together and diverged somewhere along the way, that he maybe wasn't the nicest person on earth.  My main thought regarding him though and I remember it clearly when my Ipod hit the sickbed in 2002 was \\"what kind of raging narcissist calls his help desk the 'Genius Bar'??  Well, turns out most of those preconceived notions were pretty accurate.  Yes, he was a raging narcissist but he actually hated the name \\"Genius Bar\\" and had to be talked into it by his Apple crew.<br /><br />After reading this book, you will most likely have complex feelings for whether you like or dislike this man and I think that's what makes this \\"authorized biography\\" so different.  It's long but you will breeze through it.  My only qualm is that the author reiterates certain points so many times that I would have instead liked to hear a few more personal stories.  For instance, yes Jobs lived at Technology and Arts intersection and that convergence of interests defined his career but the author beats this horse to death.  Similarly, countless times Jobs is \\"brutal\\" to people, ripping them to shreds in front of others and the author reiterates this point over and over.  But why he does this and how this behavior affected his personal/work relationships is never discussed in detail.  Those are my only, very minor gripes about the book.<br /><br />As I was wrapping up reading this book, I ran into Target the other night to get something and as soon as I walked inside I immediately noticed the design of the store, the layout, positioning of items and cash registers and how they could have done it better and I thought, \\"OMG I've been Jobified.\\"  I really couldn't be moredifferent than Jobs in that I am oblivious to my surroundings most of the time.  After reading this biography, I hope to become a little more in tune with my surroundings (not nearly as much as his neurotic self was) and to question the quality of things I am accepting.  One thing this man did not lack was passion.  It's amazing how many days we wake up and just sleepwalk through our routine thinking that our path is pre-defined and there is little we can do to change it.  Steve Jobs never accepted that and demanded better of products and people.  His extreme passion (as well as eating disorders) may have even contributed to his demise.  But the fact that I want to be a little more passionate in life is a tribute to this book.<br /><br />But just because certain aspects of Jobs inspired me doesn't mean the author sugarcoats his difficult personality.  He was notoriously horrible in his personal relationships and the author definitely does not ignore this.  One thing I was left thinking after this book was that maybe you can't be it all.  Maybe you can't be a wonderful person, great parent, and change the world.  Jobs couldn't be all three and he chose to change the world.  Bill Gates handed over his company years ago to focus on his family and philanthropic issues.  But look at what suffered:  innovation.  Yes I'm glad I have never been on the receiving end of Jobs' humiliation but I'm glad he existed to demand better for us.  And God how I love my Iphone.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|I actually bought this as a gift for my adult son.  We both saw this movie in the theaters and enjoyed it so much that he wanted to add it to his DVD collection.<br /><br />The film reunites Miss Piggy, Kermit, and many other Muppets as they struggle to put on a show to save an old theater.  Jason Segal, (a real-live person) helps.<br /><br />The songs are delightful, the acting charming, and this is a real trip down memory lane for anyone who grew up on Jim Henson's Muppets, or even enjoyed watching their kids enjoy the fun, floppy cast of characters.

B007N5YIUS|3.0|If you're a fan of Angry Birds, you'll like this.<br /><br />However, it's really nothing new - same self-destructive birds launching themselves at targets, just new targets.<br /><br />But it's also just as addictive as all Angry Birds, so most fans will enjoy it.
B000W1UOV2|4.0|I have wanted the song Manha De Carnaval for a long time.  I found it on this album and it is a very good version.  I have listened to all three guitar players in the past and find this album very interesting if you like South American sounding guitars.

B00407PNY2|5.0|Great movie.
0553801473|2.0|I really enjoyed the beginning of the series, but feel now he's got so many characters that he isn't moving the story forward and a lot of it just dragged for me.  I have to say with as long as he takes to write the series, I don't know if when the 6th book in the series comes out whether I'll pick it up again or not.  It just seems like he gets you interested in a character only to get rid of them in some horrible way and then pick up the story with characters you didn't even like or was interesting enough at the start to continue the story.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Scary but true. This is the story of a child who was betrayed, starved, abused by everyone who was supposed to nurture & protect her. Surprise! It made her crazy. Ultimately the circle was complete when she produced a child of her own to neglect & abandon.<br />The author manages to keep the reader hoping for a &#34;happily ever after&#34; conclusion while telling an honest story. She provides reason for hope and a critical view of the cold protection system through a very readable work of fiction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A must read. I could read this book over and over again. Make sure to read the other two books.

0071752854|5.0|Quite simply one of the best business books I have ever read.<br /><br />Klaff fuses neuroscience with his own experience to peel back the mystery of getting and keeping attention long enough to pitch. Suffice to say, it has to do with simplicity, novelty, controlling the frame, acquiring situational status, crafting the pitch to appeal to the croc brain, and avoiding neediness.<br /><br />And all done in a wonderfully succinct and readable 200 or so pages.<br /><br /> If I could give it six stars, I would.
0765325950|5.0|The pace and scope of this book had me hanging on the edge throughout the entire book.  I simply couldn't put it down once I started.  After years of waiting to see the conclusion this was a fitting end.  We knew that all the plot lines wouldn't be resolved as that wasn't the intention, this book as in life leave some endings a mystery.<br /><br />I started reading this series in mid 90's at the time I was in my early teens and I was taken by the first book almost immediately.  While I found some books in the middle of the series to be slightly dry I still enjoyed them overall and the setup for the last 3 books was amazing.<br /><br />I encourage everyone that hasn't read the series to start from the first and follow the story through all its twists and turns.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|remember watching this when the kids were small and my son wanted it for Christmas and was happy to purchase it for him.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|However seeing it for the first time on Roku was less enjoyable, it was so choppy in the end.  It took away some of the enjoyment of the movie.  Judi Dench was super as always as was the rest of the cast and I loved the whole premise of the movie.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Again, Gillian Flynn puts a spin on a story of family dysfunction in a whole new way.  Not since GLASS CASTLE have I read a more interesting story of the toxic flow of energy with a family gone very wrong.  Engrossing story.  Excellent read.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a marriage gone wrong in the worst way.  Not your average formulaic story about marriage and disappearance.  Many plot twists and unexpected changes.  Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer.  I just finished SHARP OBJECTS and was a fan of that one, too.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Heath Ledgers' portrayal of the joker is outstanding and he takes this movie to another level. Great action overall great movie.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|This book was a different read for me. At first I liked it and then the topic changed and I was not sure I would like it anymore, but i have to say it came together pretty good. Same sex marriage is a  topic that alot of people are against so I had mixed emotions while reading the book. I continued to read the book and was pleased witht he ending. As a christian, I had thoughts about parts of the book that I did not particulary care for but it is a story and it kept my attention. The topic itself is a hot topic and if have strong feelings about same sex marriage/relationships this may not be the book for you. Objectivity when choosing this book will determine wheter you like it or not.<br />I personally have read almost all of Jodi's books and I enjoy the topics she writes about. Maybe it is because of the story she tells,but I enjoy her style of writing.. My sister and I read them and discuss them, but overall we like her as an author.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Have always been a fan of Tron and thought about how well a modern adaptation with todays cgi would be. I was not let down with the sequel, It was well written and very visually pleasing. great cgi and story line was great. Hope another sequel is in the works.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Highly spiritual book.  It is so much deeper than the story seems at first reading.  I was very moved by this book and found things in myself that I had not explored before.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|i had to see the book before i went to see the movie.  glad i did.  it was a wonderful read.  quick, easy, capitvating, real, exciting, amazing.  love the twist at the end that made me wonder...

B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved this book from the very beginning. Maggie pulls you right into their world. This book would be good for anyone but especially people who liked the twilight series. This book made me cry several times!
B002FWW996|5.0|Saw this move long ago and it is still great watching it again. Really don't care for \\"instant download\\" movies, will buy the DVD to watch again on my non internet HD TV's.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Usually I take my time when reading, but I couldn't put it down!  It filled in the back story of other Connelly novels.  I am really hooked on Harry Bosch.  He's my hero!
0061251321|2.0|I will try to keep this short.  There are many reviews that describe the book in great detail so I will not do that here.  I do understand what the book is trying to say and appreciate that it is a result of 10 years of research.  However, I find a major flaw in the main premise of the book.  Essentially, there are 5 stages of tribes, and to \\"Build a Thriving Organization\\", we should all strive to be Stage 4 or 5.  Stages 1-3 are imperfect and people in those stages should be coached to reach level 4.  The authors also state that you cannot skip stages, that is, you must go from stage 1 to 2 first before going to stage 3.  Hence, it is necessarily true that even if you have a stage 1 employee, you have to eventually make them go to stage 4 by going through stages 2 and 3.  In the book, each chapter describing the stages describe the next stage as a desireable stage, but once you get there, you cannot stay there because it too has problems.  I see this as a major problem in management.  Basically the message is that you can take an employee who is violent and suicidal, take them to stage 2 because it solves the problems of being in stage 1, but then stage 2 is full of problems, so you have to take them to stage 3.  But stage 3 is also problematic, so push them to stage 4!  A manager is sending the wrong message to the employee if they get a stage 2 employee to stage 3 because it is so much better, and yet once they get there, they are still not good enough.<br /><br />The reality, of course, is that you can't make every organization (or employee) a stage 4.  A better lesson from the book would be how to manage groups that are at different stages, rather that how to make everyone stage 4-5.  While it sounds like a great idea, I don't really see anyone being able to take their worst-performing team member and transforming them to a stage 4.  Most people may be able to \\"improve\\" themselves one stage up but probably will stay there.<br /><br />The other issue I have withthe book is that the \\"stages\\" are oversimplified and thrown around to describe people and organizations interchangeably, often within the same sentence.  Describing people as being in a stage is essentially labeling and categorizing them (which is exactly what the book tells you NOT to do!), while describing an organization as a particular stage is very different in terms of managing the problem.  The book tells the tribal leader to learn the language of all stages and work with people one-on-one, and yet for stage 1, it tells you to have a \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy for stage 1 behavior.  Also the solutions are oversimplified as well and somewhat sophomoric (\\"help them make friends\\"???)<br /><br />This book had unrealistic and generalized feel-good buzzword solutions without real life managerial advice, much like the \\"Rich Dad\\" books' get-rich-quick schemes.  After reading \\"Tribal Leadership\\", I feel like I am better at categorizing employees into Stages but not really any better at managing my organization.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Bought this because Season 2 wasn't available on Netflix...love it so much. Got me through my mornings on the treadmill:)
B005LAJ17M|5.0|There is phenomenal  acting, cinematography and great writing. The show is smart and intelligent and keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat
B0063IH60K|4.0|I choose this game because I like solitaire, was easy to play and would recommend to other players to play
B009G78EE2|4.0|Non stereotypical radio music. If you like rap music that talks about drugs, treating women like whores, and spending all there money on cars, clothes and jewelry then this isn't for you. Talented lyricist with a grown up mature message. Give us more like this!!!
B004I744AS|5.0|I really like this app.  it has games and its seems to be an abundant resource.  Its my go to!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it is a fun game some of the mini games are kind of lame but for the most part its fun.
1439152799|1.0|Fresh from \\"The Secret Keeper\\" I was a huge new Morton fan and went in search of more.  \\"The Secret Keeper\\" was excellent and earned it's high Amazon reviews, but don't be fooled because \\"The Distant Hours\\" does not, and it is an excruciatingly, long and disappointing read.<br /><br />\\"The Secret Keeper\\" took a while to kick in and I always finish books, so I persevered but this one made me want to break that rule because it never got any better.  Way too long and overly descriptive, yet still managed to be confusing.  What really happened?  Why the bloody shirt?  Why would kids ever love such a horrible book to begin with?  560 pages later I still don't know or care - a waste of precious reading time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing read. I couldn't put the book down. Loved reading it even more on my Kindle Fire! Finding a book like this makes me want to read a lot more. I was captivated by this story.  I would go see this if it were made into a movie. Great love story and great twist.  Even though I could almost guess the story I still couldn't wait to read the next page. Thanks Colleen.
0071762345|5.0|One cool part about social media is it can be done initially with little budget, and Likeable Social Media gives seriously substantial tips to get started on this and hints about what direction you should go with content. This book gives strategic practical advice, was well written, and entertaining. Highly recommended.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Loving it. I have a Motorola headset and it sync'd up great. Love it. First BlueTooth headset and device. Finally, no wires
B00AW28HF6|5.0|Tsunami Connection is the first in the New World Trilogy of novels from Michael James Gallagher and it is excellant.  The Tsunami Connection  establishes a new and unique voice from Gallagher; a mixture of no-nonsense thriller writing combined with fascinating multi- cultural understanding  and rich  character development gives us a thoughtful and fast-paced international thriller.  Kefira, Tsunami Connections's  amazing protagonist is clever, thoughtful, and a Superhero with human failings and energies.<br /><br />Set in and around the Middle east, North Korea and Russia, the story inexorably draws us in and never lets go.<br />The terrorist thriller plot is tight. Yet there is interesting, well written and knowledgeable side bar storeies about Tango in Buenes Aires, for example, that are  stunningly good.<br /><br />Gallagher goes for short-ish chapters that closely track the story and offers no pauses. It is a \\"don't put me down book\\"  Sex and violence are included, but Gallagher  doesn't dwell too long on either, he is more likely to spend time on the intricacies and psychology of a suspect's interrogation.<br /><br />It is a great debut novel. Read this and wait for the next.... Enjoy.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have several Camera Bags, but this is the one I usually pull out to use.  I put into the adjustable compartments a  DSLR, camcorder, a couple of lens and hand a tripod on the outside of the bag.  Very useful.

B00ADS98FC|3.0|This movie had a lot of things going for it, for me. I am a big fan of both Rebel Wilson and Adam DeVine. Also, I loathe the TV show Glee. From everything I saw and read, I thought this movie would be the anti-Glee, but maybe I just expected too much. I knew the plot would be contrived but I can usually suspend my need for realism and take a comedic movie for what it's worth, especially if it's funny. But I couldn't get into this movie at all. The only times I laughed were during a few of Adam DeVine's scenes. This movie really fell flat for me. It wasn't funny and I didn't connect with the characters.
0316174483|4.0|I bought this as a X-mas gift for my 3 year old and its a little old for her to do herself. But she still enjoys it. Mommy usually ends up doing most of the work but its a great little indoor craft!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really fun game. Theorist only one problem though, when you go to buy a game, you have to have a lot of coins later in the game. other than that it is really fun
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is a great toy. No separate pieces to lose and very durable. I have 6 kids at home between 8 and 17 and they have all tried to figure this maze out with 2 of them succeeding. Good entertainment.
B007SGM084|5.0|Having read all three books, I couldn't wait to purchase it for my Kindle book.  Highly recommend the trilogy bundle for your Kindle at a reasonable price.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|It will be very useful when traveling.  Having this makes the Kindle Fire a useful thing, instead of a frivolous thing.
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|While the first season has only six episodes, The Walking Dead truly is spectacular in not only the zombie genre but also the drama genre of film and tv shows.  This set comes with all the episodes (as expected) but also includes special features on the second disc which is nice.  The only complaint I have is that the show is not High Definition.  I am not sure how they filmed this series but whenever I watch it on Blu-Ray I notice it has a &#34;grainy&#34; sort of look to it.  I've tested this on three different TVs and they all looked the same.  I also bought the second season on Blu-Ray and noticed the same effect.  This is only a minor gripe though, I highly recommend this series to anyone.

B00275EGWY|1.0|Well, I spent 32 years on Army Active Duty and was a Lt Weapons Infantryman, among other specialties.  I also completed the Army Mines, Demo and Boobytraps school.  I found the DVD to be incredibly unrealistic in virtually every respect and apparently written and directed by people totally unfamiliar with the actual Army.<br /><br />There are so many discrepancies I could include, but just read the reviews by \\"A Kid's Review,\\" and \\"Maskirovka.\\"  they pretty much say it all.  I cannot understand how this movie was given 6 academy awards and rated highly by critics.  Must be politics and PC involved.  I hate these kinds of movies.
B000002KXO|5.0|I am very pleased with this CD, it sounds great, no skips. This is one of my favorite albums ever. Stevie Nicks can get a little country.
1600108512|4.0|The illustration representation of the story are what drew me to this book.  Great for any fan of the movie.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant series ever to come to TV.  For anyone who grew up on the fairytales and fables of Mother Goose, the Brothers Grimm, and Hans Christian Andersen, \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is just plain fun!  The concept is one that most of us probably fantasized about at one time or another when we were children - what would happen if Beauty and the Beast were real, or why can't I have a cricket-sized Conscience to carry around with me?  The cast is perfectly cast, especially Robert Carlyle as Rumplestiltskin, and the interplay between real world scenes and fairytale scenes is a real treasure to watch.  During this first season, part of the fun was discovering who the citizens of Storybrooke were and finding all the different ways they related to one another, both in the real world and in the land of once-upon-a-time.  Lana Parilla is fantastic as the Evil Queen/Mayor, and the pursuit of happy endings by all the characters is an adventure for every viewer, no matter what age.  I cannot wait to own Season Two!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I suspect that most people have sensed that their existence, their purpose for being, lies far beyond any earthly evidence they can compile or discern.  Dr. Alexander's account  will bolster the faith of many that haven't had a tour of heaven.  That a scientist would take the courageous risk of admitting this experience suggests to me that he truly believes it happened.  Good for him and good for the rest of his readers who need our faith jump-started from time to time.
1451627297|5.0|Stephen King is the master of horror - no one disputes this.  However, in his novel \\"11/22/63,\\" King moves in a different direction, building instead upon his skill as a writer of suspense.  A trip back in time - everyone has imagined this at one time or another, and always the questions of \\"What would I change?\\" and \\"What would be the result if I did change it?\\" come to mind.  King takes the reader on a trip back in time to one of the most memorable days in history - the day of Kennedy's assassination - and offers a glimpse of what could have happened (well, at least in King-land) had JFK not been killed on that fateful day.<br /><br />The writing in this is solid, rich in historical details and, of course, King's imagination.  Jake Epping, a man from the 21st century, is pulled back in time through a portal at the back of a diner, and comes to embrace the world of 1958-1963, where the portal dumps out.  His love story with a small-town librarian of the past is beautiful, bittersweet, and absolutely believable.  Epping's pursuit to change Kennedy's assassination is suspenseful and exciting; the details of the past are vivid, the characters rich and alive on the page, and the reader is compelled to keep turning the page, no matter what else is happening.<br /><br />Best of all, the ending is something to be treasured.  It is not at all predictable, but it is most definitely satisfying.  This is a book anyone can enjoy, whether you are a Stephen King fan or not,, and enjoy it you will.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was a very good book. That he and the tiger survived is incredible. Once I got into it, I could not put it down.

0765325950|1.0|I am disappointed in the delayed ereader release. I will not be buying this book in hardcover. I will either use a library or borrow from a friend. I certainly wont be waiting 4 months to finish this book but for some reason i dont feel like giving them my money. :(
B0060D133E|5.0|I bought these to watch with my grand daughter and was so impressed with all four of them. Very well done and we have watched them over and over. Definitely worth the investment.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This product is a copy of the real life proof case the plastic face for the phone had flaws in it the piece on the inside that allows you to change the phone from loud to silent was broken and when compared to a life proof case that I purchased at best buy you can clearly see the differences between the two.
0385535147|2.0|The last Grisham book I really enjoyed was The Brethren.  Since then I have been very disappointed over and over again.  I still keep buying each new release with great hopes that Grisham will finally come through once again.  That did not happen with this book.  After getting half way through the book I had lost interest in the story, did not even care what happened, and found no desire to even finish reading the book.  In my 44 years of reading books this is the first book I could not finish and I will not buy another Grisham book again.  He has been disappointing far to many times.
0316017922|5.0|MalcoIm Gladwell is a brilliant writer, in my opinion.<br />I have enjoyed all of his books and look forward to reading more from him!

B004DLPXAO|5.0|the Kindle download is very good for children to increase their reading ability  as well as making it easier for adults<br />read more
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I really didn't even want to see it because I was a fan of the original series.  This is so cute.  Don't expect it to be anything like the show.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|It was well written, Mystery and Suspense and a creative way to tell a story.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and  had a hard time putting down!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I did not think I would enjoy this movie - but I loved it.  Not the best story line (yes you will predict the ending before the movie even starts)but the singin gwas great and i laughed multiple times
B009186JYI|5.0|Nerver heard of this concert. Bought it for my husband after I purchased the Stones and Muddy Waters DVD. Husdand is big Stones fan and really liked it.
B00000J048|4.0|My Grand-son already has plenty of Legos, and recieved several more sets this Christmas, so I wanted to give him something similar, but perhaps a bit more advanced. I'm still waiting to hear from them about his reaction.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved it!  I was hooked by the first episode and could not wait to watch each one.  Definetiy worth it.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|Anyway, my fiance really wanted me to see this movie, and how could I pass up a Morgan Freeman movie with his sweet seductive narrative throughout the entire movie.  Sadly, I had seen so many parodies of the movie or just parts of it (Simpsons, Family Guy) that I already figured out the outcome.  Regardless, it was still a really great movie and both Tim Robbin and Freeman did an amazing job in it.
B000022TSY|5.0|Very good picture and sound quality from a classic movie that only a hardcore biker or wannabe would enjoy totally.
B0088WFZQG|3.0|The acting in the movie wasn't terribly great--but that was balanced out by the fact that real-life, active duty U.S. Navy Seals & other Navy members played a significant part in the movie.  There were some decent action shots in the flick.  Certainly not worth the buy, maaaaybe worth the rent, worth watching if you catch it (for free) on TV.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Great remaster job on this album. A remastered rendition of this in a dvd would not be a bad idea.
0765325950|5.0|\\"And it came to pass in those days, as it had come before and would come again, that the Dark lay heavy on the land and weighed down the hearts of men, and the green things failed, and hope died. And men cried out to the Creator, saying, O Light of the Heavens, Light of the World, let the Promised One be born of the mountain, according to the prophecies, as he was in ages past and will be in ages to come. Let the Prince of the Morning sing to the land that green things will grow and the valleys give forth lambs. Let the arm of the Lord of the Dawn shelter us from the Dark, and the great sword of justice defend us. Let the Dragon ride again on the winds of time.<br /><br />(from Charal Drianaan te Calamon,<br />The Cycle of the Dragon.<br />Author unknown, the Fourth Age)\\"<br /><br />With those words one of the greatest adventures in Epic Fantasy began over 20 years ago. Robert Jordan's The Wheel Of Time has become \\"The\\" fantasy series. Others have tried to dethrone this master work of fiction but none have.<br /><br />With the release of A Memory of Light, the Wheel Of Time has reached its ultimate climax. The greatest and largest scale war yet for the series and perhaps for fantasy as a whole since the publication of Return Of The King. A book full of heroes and villains, pawns and puppets. All woven into a grand tapestry of a story that was everything I hoped it could be. The ending of this novel was exactly what I have always expected. Through out the series mentions of \\"The Stories\\" have been abundant. Their perfect stories where the Heroes always have a plan, where things always go their way and in the end everyone lives happily ever after. Real Life is never like that and this ending reflects that. As in real life not every plot thread is tied up, not ever story has a happy ending or a ending at all. That's life however, and life continues. The ending however is more than satisfying. Giving the right balance of closure and mystery to keep the world alive.<br /><br />There are no endings to the turning to the Wheel Of Time, but it was An Ending.
0812993357|5.0|for someone interested in the great world of fashion this is a must read, personal, interesting and full of history
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Take Me Home makes me want to take One Direction home. I am so happy that all the boys had a chance to sing more instead of Liam, Harry and a little of Zayn singing like on the last album, Up All Night. Each band member has a truly unique voice that makes them sound really great when you combine them together. Every song is worth a listen. 9.8/10
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This was one of the first lego sets that we bought after the 3 year old was previously playing with building blocks (bigger pieces). Both 3 and 2 year old loved these and immediately started playing a lot of time with them.<br />It also helped them know animal names.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good Read and Introduction of Jack Reacher to the masses. I'm on my second novel and can't wait to wade through all of them. Although, Tom Cruise is NOT the first actor to come to mind to play the stoic Mr Reacher.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Neither my husband or I enjoyed this movie, and we loved the first three of the series. The storyline was not cohesive and seemed much more 'evil' than the previous movies. I've talked to others who enjoyed it but we did not.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was based more on science than the actual visit. Lots of big, scientific words. I would have liked more details on the actual visit.
0385535147|2.0|I like John Grisham.  He's good for an entertaining light read.  This book is only 340 pages long and in a lot of ways I feel as if he fulfilling his contract putting this out.  The 1st half of the book moves quickly and is good, really good.  But in the second half it takes a turn to never never land.  I found myself going back to figure out if I missed who Nathan Cooney was as well as calculating in my head how much the hero of the book was spending.  I finished it and everything washed in the end, but it's far fetched to say the least.  Not his best book, but not his worst.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it so much read it in one day, and wouldn't mind reading it again. Would definitely recommend this book to everyone and anyone I know.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I bought this movie before I ever saw it. I already owned the first two. I am glad I got it to complete my collection, but I was slightly disappointed with the movie... It was good. There was just something lacking that is hard to explain. I would still buy it if you own the first two.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|All the Dexter series are awesome!<br />if you liked the first you'll like the rest.<br />Im trying to collect all seven<br />also great price they can run up to $40 at some stores maybe more<br />got this for$ 19.99 plus with super saver shipping rocked
0374214913|4.0|The plot is the kind you would normally find in a 400 page book. By the time I was 2/3 of the way through the book, I was confused--how could this much excitement be happening in so few pages? I almost wish the book were more robust, bursting with more details for me to wade through. But as it is, it is a charming read. It's quick, clever, and has endearing characters. Highly recommend.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is one of Clancy's best. Jack Ryan is a character he created in his first novel. Following him through his career has always intrigued me. The author did not give him super powers. Now his son follows in a similar path. Enjoy the story, it worth the money.<br />The underlying concept of cyberwarfare is scary.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have always enjoyed Tom Clancy, this book does not disappoint his fans.  Would have given it 5 stars but the Chinese super villain Dr. Tong was rather one dimensional and seemed more of a computer program than a person.  Just my two cents.
B002U5HKZ6|1.0|A bountiful harvest of saccharine prose and condescending philosophical rhetoric. Must I write 10 more words to complete this review?
B009VB97EY|2.0|I didn't think the book lived up to the hype it received on television and the story line wasn't that great.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I'm a tough critic when it comes to Christmas music so this CD is getting 4.5 stars. It has some really good songs on it and a couple of just okay. Overall I think Michael does a great job and this is a worthy addition to any Christmas collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Thought this was the best comic book series yet so wasn't going to not buy this, but blu-ray disks plus a digital copy to watch them over the holidays when my options are this or whatever the 1940's movie my aunt picks out? ya... came in handy to play on the Roku (didn't have the disks with me).
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Probably not. In fact, they probably won't like the fact that you are rapidly adding CO2 with all the laughing. This is one of my children's favorite movies. In fact, this is to replace the original since I think she wore it out. We just watch the movie with the sound off since she knows all the lines. Seriously though, they've done a very good job with this series (with the exception of the last one).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was erotic to say they least and ended unexpectedly,  it left me hanging and wondering \\"what happens next?\\"
0452295548|5.0|If you work with stroke patients or love someone who has had a stroke, this book gives an amazingly detailed look at the whole event. This book will open your eyes to what happens to the stroke survivor.
030758836X|4.0|As bizarre as the story was, I enjoyed the whole psychological mystery wrapped around the love-and-hate relationship.  It was a little slow in the beginning; it took a few chapters for me to be fully engaged.  The rest, the last two thirds, however, was excellent.  The first person narrative being switched back and forth between Nick and Amy was brilliant; it certainly added a great thrill.  It was unexpected, unpredictable, and progressed at a great pace, and had twist after twist.  The ending was as bizarre as the story itself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Being part of the Hunger game series this book is AWESOME! But my vote is that this book out of the series is the best, I encourage any bibliophile to read it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Waaaay better than season 1 and I loved season 1. It's a great series, with talented actors & writers. Worth watching
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The timeless argument of which is better, the book, or the movie, is obvious in this case. ITS THE BOOK! If you have never read this book before but have seen the movie DONT MISS OUT!
B00ANI5CPW|1.0|I actually stopped watching this show. I was so tired of them trying to shove the gay part down my thought. It was a pretty funny show in the first and second seasons. A friend told me to give this episode a try. This is probably one of the funnier ones in a LONG time. Still this show has tanked a lot.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Im bais on my vote to this book, it is REALLY amazing, I just didn't like the ending. I wont ruin it! I promise! Take a look at it yourself!
B005OP2Y1E|1.0|I do not know what happened, but this show has lost it. Why do they have to portray the husband and wife and stupid and outdated. It is as if they want to push their agenda. The show was funny before just leave it alone.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|would love it if along with storyline we could historic fact along the way too. puzzles need more notes . too short needs to be longer for the money would pay for story like a good book......
B00A8KJK7G|1.0|There is no way this movie should be rated PG. i am so glad i watched it first before i let my kids watch it. Bringing pets back to life, a cat morphing into a killer bat, a boy digging up his dead dog. Our rating system for movies is broken. To all parents watch this movie before you let your kids under 12 watch it. Just because it is animation does not mean it should get an automatic PG or G.
B0058RN85O|5.0|It is great to watch something during the day and relax a bit since it lasts only 20 min aprox.
0307730697|5.0|Bought it for my DH and he loved it. Couldn't put it down! Highly recomend this book! Has many wow moments.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Once I started reading the first book I couldn't stop until I reached the end. Very well written and entertaining.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This movie was completely predicable. It is also great fun. Christina sings amazingly as does Cher. I can hear my daughter belting out the songs from the other room.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|This amplug is just incredible. Its sound is absolutely amazing. It is really useful and powerful and it only needs two small batteries!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wanted to see the movie and didn't get the chance.  I thought that it was an interesting idea about how war was settled.  Hopefully it never becomes a reality,
B007V65R54|5.0|I just bought the book and just read couple of 1st pages and I know already I will love it ... one of the 1st sections is targeting Big Data and I liked it a lot. We really don't know yet what's coming from this space. Many discussions from enterprise software world around Big Data I have seen/read really do not see the danger of wrong predictions based on wrong understanding of the data (the noise). Can you see the danger of i.e. sentiment analysis tool scanning huge number of tweets and blogs and wrongly identify the 'message' ...
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is an intricate game with many interesting aspects.  I just wish I had known the free gems at the beginning run out quickly.  You need them to advance and I will not pay real money for them.  Otherwise it is a good free game.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I had to read this book for my book club and was not looking forward to reading it. Was I ever wrong. While I came away not liking Steve Jobs the person, I appreciate his absolute business genius. The book was fast paced(after the first150 pages) and enjoyable reading.I thought Isaacson did a wonderful job of story telling. I even found myself reconsidering my feelings about Jobs at the end of the book. I would heartily recommend to anybody interested in today's business world.
B009MO5G90|5.0|The Resident Evil franchise is a fun sci-fi series. Having it in 3D was especially fun. Who couldn't root  for the zombie killers when they win!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|forgive any punctuation or spelling errors as I am speaking this review into my cell phone.  I feel this CD has a great balance between heaviness and melodic atmospheric vocals which I find very appealing and satisfying.  they manage to really rock and make your head shake without resorting to screaming in the vocals.  the album is heavy yet accessible, and I feel stands with and compliments their best work such as white pony and Diamond Eyes.
0525952926|5.0|Met all my expectations.  Follett continues to provide accurate and VERY interesting historical novels.  This book would stand alone, as well as the second of the trilogy.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|my husband and I sat together and enjoyed both series<br />no one fell asleep.i can't wait for series three to start
B006LSZECO|1.0|I gave it one star because it was such a fabulous read all the way to the end. Then the author apparently decided she was done and just stopped.  End! Nothing!  Just ended it.  I thought I was missing something so I reread the last pages.  Nothing!  Over!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Just finished watching Season 2 this week-end.  It is a great series - well worth the money if you didn't catch it on PBS.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. Some of the best writing I've ever had the pleasure of reading. I can hardly put into words the power of this book. I laughed, I cried, and I enjoyed every second.
B007RE0RR8|5.0|These dolls are so expensive and my niece asked for one for Christmas. When I found this doll for the price I could not pass it up. I would buy it again. The packaging was good and it arrived in time for the holidays.
1451695195|4.0|If you ever wondered about heaven (what it could be like, who is there, what you would do?), you need to read this book!  Whether you are a believer or non-believer, Eben gives you insight to what may be next for you.  Abounding love and total acceptance, when do we get there?<br />AMiller
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have this version of Solitaire On multiple devices.  I don't always win as I find it challenging. Try it...y<br />ou'll like it.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|This was one of the worse movies I've seen. It wasn't funny or interesting. It was pointless from beginning to end.
B004ZNARH4|5.0|I'm a huge Floyd fan and this was an excellent gift from my boyfriend.  I love the little things included in the set, i.e., 3 large Marbles with the prism on them, a really, really, really cool scarf, coasters and of course the DVD and Bluray library.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So beautiful. It's just really relatable, and written so simply; it makes you put yourself in the characters shoes. A new favorite :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Never saw the movied because I thought it was for teens, but not true at all.  It is an interesting portrayal of what life could be like if our world ceased to exist as we know it now.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I think what I like the most , is that it does not follow the comics 100%! So I call still be surprised while watching.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Dexter keeps getting better. It's hard to believe that I find myself routing for a serial killer but season after season I do
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love the game but once you get past the fist little bit of each game it becomes a mindless game. that fist little bit though is HUGELY important to how the rest of your game goes. Even while this game is mindless it is incredably fun. I highly recomend it.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|entertaining and engaging with great grown- up graphics. each level provides a new display so the game stays interesting and fast solutions are rewarded. really enjoy this game.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was an awesome book its funny how Greg always thinks its gonna be just about him, but sometimes I wonder why it's always Rowely that the girls like better.
B0025KVLRY|5.0|......................With The Beatles..............that's what every girl in the Western World fantasized about.  The guize all wanted to be one of them (based on who there favorite one was).  They gave this country a badly needed &#34;shot-in-the-arm&#34; post JFK assination depression.

B0061QD88S|5.0|The dvd was in perfect shape.  It made a great Christmas gift to my grand daughter who is collecting Disney movies.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|There was little reason for anyone to suspect that from a &#34;thread-bare-tired-post WWII region&#34; four lads would create a musical legacy that would captivate and change the entire world.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|this show is side splitting funny thank you for bringing it to my computer. such a funny show very good
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I know this series always leaves you hanging, but this ending was a little to much. There were to many lose ends, nothing seemed to get solved. It feels like he cut off way to short just to get another book published!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It was very good book<br />I don't like it because it is a dictionary<br />I would recommend it to anyone who wants to look something up
B00AAX68HG|5.0|So far a very fun puzzler. Ads are the &quot;bottom strip&quot; variety with a interstitial every 4-5 puzzles, nothing too bad for free. Played through 48 levels so far and I'd say it is complicated enough to be a fun challenge. Well worth the download.
B00280LYIM|5.0|5 of 5 stars. I have never found a better series. For fans of Greek mythology you should read this book.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|I would reconmend this movie, it is a nice spiritual family movie for eveyone to watch. Thank you so much
B004T2QZL8|5.0|lol great when your bored a real pass time if you like learning new things this is a great app to download worth the money
B001HN6922|5.0|This movie is very similar to the first one, but has an actual bad guy.  It's a little bit darker of a movie than Cars 1.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was an interesting story line full of hope and adolescents confusion and it was just a good coming of age story. I really enjoyed it.
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|I loved this movie!  Great cast and kept me glued the entire time!  I hope there will be some kind of sequel.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Vey well written and interesting story and an interesting cast of characters.  Story kept me interested and I did not want it to end
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Full of action, but lacks substance, plus always wanted to compare to the original one.<br />It's hard to produce &#34;remakes&#34;, but still...
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was the greatest book I've ever read! I hope theirs another book to carry on the rest of this book! Like what happens next to the peculiar children and the ymbryne (Miss Peregrine)!?
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Liked the plot and the ending but the sound was BAD had to keep turning it up and down up and down!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Excellent author, great buy, good price. :) amazon is wonderful for things like this. Will continue to shop here for books and more.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Esy read finished in four nights as  always maintained the readers interest .  Consistant with the Clancy writting style wiht twists and turns

B005KELQEU|5.0|This case fits my Kindle paperwhite great and is high quality.  It protects the kindle in my backpack while I'm biking around town.  Highly recommended!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Michael Connelly seems to be on a roll. First &#34;The Drop,&#34; now &#34;The Black Box,&#34; although I didn't enjoy this Harry Bosch book as much as the first.
B0026KZ3T0|5.0|This is a \\"pick-me-up\\" comedy--no matter what mood you're in! Will Smith and Kevin James are a HILLARIOUS combo in this film! Although each one is a stand alone comic, in this film, they compliment and enhance each other's funniness to the max! This will be a classic in years to come. You gotta live Will and Kevin! Well done!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I saw this on sale, so decided to give it a try. I can not imagine anyone not loving this book. It's a great science fiction novel, that even this fantasy romance reader thoroughly enjoyed. It's not a romance novel, although there are deep romantic emotions involved. It's a story of peoples survival in a mundane world. Most take their life as it has been dealt, while the few of this story, start to question their world as they know it. Living within the silo is a dangerous place to have questions, as the curious do not survive.<br />I downloaded this book in the audio also, and went back and forth between reading and listening until it was done.<br />It's a very unpredictable read, that keeps you totally engrossed until you are finished. The characters are compelling, and you feel you're with them living in their shoes.<br />I will definitely go on with more from this author. Thanks Hugh, for having a great imagination, and being able to put it on paper so well.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love playing on my kindle but frequently loses connection and needs to be shut down in order to begin again
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|The fighting scenes were much better than in previous movies.  It was decent for a rented movie, would have been disappointed in the theater.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A great and easy read.  Suspensful and leaves you guessing to the end.  I found myself saying, &#34;One more chapter and then I will get up and do the laundry.&#34;  Before I knew it I was on the last chapter and the laundry still wasn't done!!  Great read for anyone who loves page turning mysteries.  Gillian Flynn has a writing style that is so easy to fall into.  Her descriptions of Libby Days feelings in this book really makes you feel for her.  Excellent book!!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I think this remake was very well done and well cast.  It was a little disappointing that they changes the location (no Mars) but otherwise I thought it was well worth the time.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|You feel as if you really know the characters and it is never dull. I'd like it better without so much cursing.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Well acted, well written, and the view wasn't too bad ;). I was suprised, thinking it would just be about how much nudity they could cram into the movie. While there was nidity, there was also substance and even a lesson to be learned. Overall, well worth watching.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|PROPERTY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF KOREA<br /><br />The Orphan Master's Son is a heavy book . . . and I don't mean it weighs a lot on a scale.  I mean it weighs a lot on my mind.<br /><br />I've long been fascinated with The Democratic People's Republic of Korea...the most secretive country in the world.  The stories that make it out about life in North Korea are the eyebrow-raising, \\"Really . . . you can't be serious\\" kind.  There is so little to find about what it's like to live there because no one knows--literally.  Any foreigner allowed into the country is escorted by handlers that are trained to give you a show.  Locals are forbidden to speak to outsiders.  North Korean's never leave.  It's closed and locked up tight.<br /><br />So, when I discovered a book that claimed to tell a story about North Korea, I pounced.  I knew going into it The Orphan Master's Son is probably not the typical \\"happy-ending\\" book I usually enjoy, but it was a change from the ordinary that I welcomed.  Now that I've read it, I'm happy to report that it was worth the risk.  I was right to expect a sad ending, but the journey to the close was epic.  I may not have been grinning from ear to ear at the close, but I do feel satisfied.  I got what I wanted . . . a picture of North Korea coupled with a fantastic literary experience.<br /><br />I'll leave it to you to read the description of the story.  The book cover tells it right on.  I felt the love, joy, pain, and sorrow of the characters and was very deeply moved by the writing.  The prose was a bit awkward to get comfortable with, but I eventually understood the author's writing style was part of the story.  He wrote the way he did at a tool to help the reader understand the mindset of the characters.  I wouldn't want it to be written any other way.<br /><br />This quote from an interview with the author sums up nicely what you'll find past the front cover:<br /><br />\\"The novel is a coming-of-age story, a spy story, and love story. There's an adventure-at-sea tale, a kidnapping tale, and redemption story.  You move through a number of tones, including high tragedy, the ironic, the satirical, the tender, and the just plain terrifying.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better myself.  If you can handle some language, a lot of grit, and a broken heart, reading The Orphan Master's Son will leave you with an appreciation for the good things in your life and a realization that the bad things really aren't so bad.<br /><br />This is a book for adults.  I won't like my kids near it until they are 17.ove story. There's an adventure-at-sea tale, a kidnapping tale, and redemption story.  You move through a number of tones, including high tragedy, the ironic, the satirical, the tender, and the just plain terrifying.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't have said it better myself.

B008G12ERC|4.0|Not completely what I expected (going by the sound of &#34;Madness&#34;) but a very funky mix. I think of Muse as a mix between The Cure, U2, and Prince. Weird, right? But a great &#34;epic&#34; sound to all of their songs.

030758836X|1.0|The book stinks. Read only the first two chapters. The inner dialogue of the male protagonist is clearly written by a woman; the words are too feminine.<br /><br />The book itself arrived in superb condition.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is so interesting I love the underlined message behind the book, you can do whatever you want  with your life, and it doesn't matter where you come from....our how bad it is you can always make your life the way you want it to be<br />........... Pretty good book too keeps you guessing
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is mesmerizing. I get started and don't stop until the battery goes inactive. I'm sure there's more to it than I m doing but it gives me something to learn.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Without giving up any of the plot, I will just say that this is a great book.  Even though there are personal elements to the story, Pendergast is as inscrutable as ever.  Even the more emotional parts did not illuminate much.  I wasn't too interested in the Constance/ Dr. Felder side plot, but it didn't take anything away from the story over all.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game love it recommend I enjoy playing it. wish there was more opportunities to win acorns. details are excellent.

B0098VYCCE|3.0|Kristen Stewart in my opinion is the only  bad thing about this movie. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth are awesome. Good movie not great.

B0013ND30W|4.0|Loved it watched it as soon as I opened it . And then one week later .I plan to keep it and pass it down to my kids.
B000M9BPEY|4.0|It's a very touching movie that made me think about my passed away grandfather and compare myself with the son of the main character. It's a very good movie, with great actors, great acting and interesting plot. Be prepared to cry a river of tears at some point, it's quite possible, you will. It's a good family movie and kids might learn something out of it. One thing for sure, you should watch it.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret is the best.  Would recommend to anyone seeking self improvement.  This is a great read!  Buy the Book!

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I highly recommend you read it. Great book for a long weekend or a sick day. You'll enjoy it, I know! Amazing love story
B005UG542S|5.0|Our whole family enjoys the complete series whether in print or on the screen.  The fantasy is fun; the conflict between good and evil is the heart of great literature; the characters are real even though imaginary.  I've always like that Harry needs others.  He is not the super-hero who can do things by himself.  The author has woven her amazing intellect and knowledge into an excellent series to be enjoyed by all ages and all readers - even those wo rarely read a book (e.g. like a friend of our son).
B001NLKWLW|4.0|This was a surprisingly good book.  Not a type that I usually choose to read.  The Kindle was a Christmas present and the giver put in several books, none by the familiar authors I usually read.  Hope the others are as good.
B000QXDFQW|5.0|The person I gave this to agreed with is wife that they really wanted this movie.  Therefore, I imagine I am being correct saying that it is great.  I will say that the service from Amazon, from personal experience was terrific.  Thank you.

B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Watching this you wonder where it's going, and it does drag in bits, but the payoff is pretty satisfying. All in all a good sequel and the introduction of Jared Harris (the English guy in \\"Mad Men\\") as Moriarity is brilliant casting.<br /><br />The extras are worth getting the DVD for. They're all short and sweet but offer great insight into the Holmes-Watson relationship, the use of chess onscreen and off-, and a breakdown of the Holmes-a-vision special effects.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The 2nd book in the series is a little better ... and a little worse ... then the 1st book.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />Better<br /><br />It seems as though the author has improved her writing style a considerable bit. There were much fewer outbursts of oh my and other things that were present in the 1st book.<br /><br />I still love the running commentary in Ana's head. I get a giggle out of some of her thoughts, because I would be thinking much the same thing, and having the same type of conversations with myself.<br /><br />She added a touch of mystery and suspense, which was nice. I was impressed that I couldn't guess what was going to happen, for the most part.<br /><br />I was happy that Christian finally admitted his feelings for Ana, and happy that there was a marriage proposal. I was ecstatic to see that 'Mrs. Robinson' showed her true colors, and was ousted from Christian's life. I was pleased that Ana showed a little more backbone this time around.<br /><br />The addition of Christian's dream in the beginning, and the lead-in to the 3rd book at the end was a nice touch. I'd like to see more of this type of thing from the author.<br /><br />No tampon scene! Thankfully.<br /><br />Worse<br /><br />I thought the title was giving a hint as to the direction that the BDSM was heading, but I was very wrong! Apparently \\"darker\\" doesn't mean what I thought it would mean. For someone hoping to see more involvement in The Lifestyle, I was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />The whole thing with this friend or family member falling for that friend or family member was just too ridiculous. I mean, really, it was bad enough when Kate and Elliot started dating ... and now Mia and Ethan? C'mon, that's really pushing things.<br /><br />And seriously, not every woman that sees Christian is going to want to be with him. I'm getting a bit tired of Ana's jealousy of every woman that comes within 100 feet of Christian. Oh, except the gay ones. As if they're the only people who can look at Christian without swooning.<br /><br />I'm also tiring of Christian's possessiveness and over-protective nature. It's annoying and smothering. If some guy did that to me, my filter would burst into flames, and I would say exactly what I was thinking.<br /><br />In conclusion ...<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next book. I'm hoping it doesn't turn into a book about how she married the man of her dreams, got him to stop even thinking about BDSM, raising 2.5 kids in her huge home with a white picket fence love story.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what happens with the chauvinistic, misogynist pig of an ex-boss.<br /><br />I'm really hoping for more BDSM. Darker BDSM.<br /><br />I would love to see Ana use more raunchy, descriptive words for her anatomy.

B006BDHAX0|4.0|it's fun  it's matching tiles . it's similar to every other mahjong game I've ever played . it's not horrible
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My granddaughter just loved the books.  They are very nice and make a nice collection to add to her library.
B00884GR0W|3.0|I decided to try out this game. I only played it for about 20 minutes, but was not crazy about the game or the interface. The joystick interface which is very versatile, is not the easiest to use.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until 3 men on a local sports talk radio show were talking about the best Christmas movies of all time and this made their list.  I do not consider this a Christmas movie and actually neither did they.  They went into enough detail so I found myself wanting to see it.  Of course, Amazon.com is my go to store for movies and I watched it this year after Christmas.  It is really wonderful.  My husband said he had no interest in a &#34;chick&#34; movie but after about ten minutes of overhearing the dialogue he was hooked and throughly enjoyed the movie.<br />It is not all &#34;sweetness and love&#34; but it will make you laugh.  It has a lot of actors that you will recognize.
B007JWKLMO|4.0|I'm sure i'm gonna get slammed for this, but SO much of this is re-tread. The same interviews we seen so many times before. So many items taken from Anthology. But, I guess, watching anything Beatles if enjoyable! 40 something years later and people are still asking: \\"whos your favorite beatle?\\"
B000W91RUG|5.0|I had never watched the show until a friend recently loaned me the 1st season.  I fell in love with it and discovered Sam's had the first 4 seasons on sale for 12.99 each for Christmas. Bought all 4 and have since added the 5th season.  The 6th season was already in progress when I started watching it. Have seen a few from earlier in the season on ABC.com, but I am looking forward to the 6th season's DVD to see what I missed. Some of my favorite episodes are when Penny and Sheldon are together such as when she fell in the shower or when he got locked out of his apt and spent the evening with her.  Penny has my admiration because I think those guys would drive me crazy.  I really like Kaley Cuoco and found out she was also in 8 Simple Rules. I guess she was about 16 when that show started and it is almost like seeing a younger Penny.  The characters are very similar.  8 Simple Rules ran for 3 seasons, but in true network crazyness they only put the first 2 seasons on DVD.  You would think ABC or someone would cash in on Kaley's popularity on Big Bang and give us the 3rd season. Oh well.<br /><br />pk
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, and am looking forward to seeing the film to see how true to the book it is.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is about the Seal Team that carried out the mission. As you read the book, you will come to understand what the Navy Seals are all about; you will actually feel as if you are part of the team. This is what really happened, not just hype and propaganda. Once you start reading, you will find it's hard to put down.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Love searching for the objects, the timer keeps it interesting and keeps me on m y toes.  Some levels are harder than others.
B003ZA0BCY|4.0|The Blast from the Past was an entertaining movie.  I think it is a good family movie which is hard to find.
0307591549|3.0|This book has helped with get back on a a positive note and find this book very helpful.  Would recommend to others
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Bought with Kindle Fire for Christmas.Great case for Kindle Fire. Works well for standing it up and keeping it safe from damage.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  It's better than the original movie (this is a remake). Colin Farrell is better than the Arnold.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|And exciting. I especially liked the characters in the book<br />I really liked Count Olaf and Mr.Poe and Sunny .s<br />Word's
B005HSL626|5.0|Everyone in our household loves this one ages 3-adult. Lots of fun easy enough for young ones but challenging for adults, maybe more challenging for the adults!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Overall, pretty decent movie.. weird at times! lol  One thing, it's better to rent then purchasing it... It will do if your bored.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I'm a new fan of Bruno's.  I wasn't really into his 1st CD (no particular reason,) but I saw him on some award show singing &#34;Runaway Baby&#34; and he had so much energy and was really getting the crowd hyped so I took another look at the guy and got his latest CD &#34;Unorthodox Jukebox&#34; and I TRIPLE LOVE IT!  It is a fun cd, and the music is a mixture, some upbeat, some mellow, I dont skip any of the songs - I just let it play through it's really good.<br /><br />GET IT.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|There aren't very many boards that support these yet (at least in the mITX size). In fact, after burning through a Biostar brick, I'm now using the MSI version of the mITX board that takes these newer gen AMD processors. It's fast! Coupled with a nice solid state drive, it may as well be a 3rd gen i7 on a hard drive.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Before I even finished Fifty Shades of Grey, I purchase Fifty Shade Darker and I am glad I did.  The main character, Anastasia Steele, continies telling her story about her life after meeting Christian Grey, an extremely good looking, very rich businessman with a dark side. Like the first book, the characters are so compelling that it is hard to put the book down even for a minuite.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I still haven't been able to get &#34;Night of the Purple Moon&#34; on my device.  I've tried several different times.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The movies: Never lets you down as far as expectation, storyline or resolution. Always has a way of keeping the excitement coming. The actors also had a way of portraying the characters in a way that 'spoke' to you and you really became interested in them even though they are fictional.<br />The Collection: Having all in one package is why I waited before buying any of them individually. I'm glad I did. The movies themselves were well worth the price paid. The quality and clarity of the transfers were better than as seen in the theater. Couple that with a decent sound system, and you have a completely enjoyable experience. The extras are excellent and would be of most interest to collectors and those who would just like to know more of the background. For me, indispensable. The packaging is compact and really belies the amount of value contained here.<br />Recommendation: HIGHLY! For any and everyone who loves movies to watch again. Purchase thru Amazon was easy, reliable and worry free.
B00684J49U|5.0|Enjoyable for beginning to end.  We just love this show!  It's been great to go again over the past season episodes!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have every format version in this series and up until now, I had a reluctance to discard the others. No more! They are being packed up and shipped to family as a 'care package'. This is the collection to own. The transfers were pristine. Shadows, colors etc. just seemed to pop and I almost felt as I did when I first saw these in the theater. The addition of the extras were great and added to the experience. The packaging was compact and interesting to say the least and would be of most value to collectors.<br />It is nice to have everything accessible in one package.<br />Cons: The out takes were difficult to see any difference from those left in the final movie...a secondary audio channel explanation would have been nice. My personal taste, didn't care too much for A3. Seemed to drag and tho some ends were tied up, left me with a &#34;been there, done that&#34; feeling. But good to have. A4: What now? Now that she is on Earth?.....<br />The negatives don't take away from the value or the sheer enjoyment of watching these in HD. I highly recommend this and I found the best price here on Amazon.<br />While you're buying this, also buy Prometheus. Very informative.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Even though it had the pay wall, it was fun and exciting and I enjoyed it. If you are looking for a fun game, I recommend this one.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a kid. But even moreso now as an adult. This movie inspired me to actually read &#34;The Tempest&#34; and enjoy it.<br />The movie: Well done with excellent special effects. Many of which still stand up today on their own or in inspirations in many Sci-Fi movies currently being made. The acting was good even if somewhat below the capabilities of its primaries. Leslie Neilsen's current comedic fame may effect how some may see his role, but he does a good job as well as Joseph Cotton, others and of course...Robby the Robot.<br />The discs: Excellent transfer. Deep blacks. High contrasts. Color definition. All together helps to really appreciate the work gone into the making of this classic sci-fi. The extras were not a let down either. They were very informative and enjoyable to watch. Seeing effects I could easily identify in movies and TV was fun. I could hardly believe the amount of thought that went into the effects. Budgeting helps creativity a lot.<br />Recommendation: You should own this. Enjoy it for the pure movie enjoyment and not compare it to what we have today.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|As good as the others,more heart this time. Now hope for a BIB3  Quite a feat for sequels. performances were true to character
B005QUQ99K|5.0|I Find it odd that some people are terrified of having to go poop in a public restrooms or anywhere else other than home. I do understand that some public facilities are not so clean, but as Dr. Ian Malcolm said,&#34;When you gotta go you gotta go.&#34; The legos were great.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I enjoyed reading the things the movie left out. The story is a wonderful read.  I liked that they had more adventures than in the movie and I felt it built up the relationships between the characters moreso than the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|3 stars for decent layout and a nice look.  OK functions but there are better apps for calculators out there.  If this looks like somethinh you would like, then check out Realcalc as well.
037582913X|5.0|I used to read this to my Children many years ago.  I bought it to read to my grandsons.  They love it as much as their mother did.  I was pleasently surprised to find the much larger edition.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|Not as good as the &#34;I&#34; version for the pod & pad people.<br />Has several glitches that cause the game to reset itself at times, and isn't fun!
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect and my wife thought it would stink. We were both engaged and Liam Neeson was great.<br />All of the actors were good.<br />No spoiler alert but be sure to watch to the very end and I mean to the end of the credits.
B005S9ELVC|4.0|Okay, I'm a bit biased.  I'm partial to movies featuring trench coats, fedora, tough-talking cops, smooth-talking dames, and blazing Tommy guns.  \\"Gangster Squad\\" is the type of movie I go to the movies hoping to see every year, my typical fantasies transferred directly to the big screen.<br /><br />Recent attempts at the genre, like Frank Miller's misguided [[ASIN:B001TVEW5S The Spirit]] and Brian De Palma's overwrought [[ASIN:B000NCX6Y2 The Black Dahlia]], have been hit-and-miss.  But \\"Gangster Squad\\" hits the mark, having more in common with De Palma's 1987 classic [[ASIN:B00029NKU6 The Untouchables (Special Collector's Edition)]].  The premise alone bears an uncanny resemblance.  Set in 1940's L.A. instead of 1920's Chicago, the movie follows an incorruptible cop hand-picking a team of honest cops to take down a notorious gangster, this time Mickey Cohen instead of Al Capone.  But while \\"The Untouchables\\" required a great cast to carry Kevin Costner as its lead, Josh Brolin's acting chops are more similar to Sean Connery's.  Brolin plays Sergeant John O'Mara, a grizzled hero whose unwillingness to stay out of Mickey Cohen's way makes waves for his superiors, but Chief Bill Parker (a surprisingly dignified performance by Nick Nolte) recruits him to head a task force bent on undermining Cohen's rule.<br /><br />O'Mara contrasts sharply with younger, go-with-the-flow Sgt. Wooters (Ryan Gosling), who is content to spend his nights gambling, drinking, and picking up dames at Cohen's favorite nightclub, but soon finds himself joining the team.  O'Mara recruits switchblade-wielding beat cop Anthony Mackie, old timey wild westerner Robert Patrick (complete with six-shooter and Yosemite Sam mustache), and tech whiz Giovanni Ribisi to round out the team, with Robert Patrick's Hispanic partner Michael Pena joining the party without being formally invited.<br /><br />While \\"The Untouchables\\" boasted method actor Robert DeNiro as Al Capone, it was hard to forget he was Robert DeNiro.  By comparison, Sean Penn disappears completely into the role of infamous boxer-turned-mobster Mickey Cohen.  He's truly terrifying from the moment, barely past the studio logos, we see what he does to those who oppose or fail him.<br /><br />Emma Stone, needless to say, is pretty as a pin-up as the dame, Cohen's main squeeze with red hair and redder lips.  But she's not the movie's only eye candy.  There's plenty of gorgeous cinematography of Los Angeles landmarks and glossy recreations of 40's nightclubs and casinos.  And, as much as I want to dislike Ryan Gosling, he's great as the youthful detective whose love affair with Stone's character forms a large part of the narrative.  But it's ultimately Brolin's straight-laced detective and family man who carries the movie, from the moment he punches his way into a mob-controlled hotel to save a blonde bombshell from being initiated into a brothel in his introductory scene.<br /><br />While \\"Gangster Squad\\" has all the trademarks of the film noir genre, that's just the outward veneer of an all-out action flick, more in the vein of \\"The Untouchables\\" or [[ASIN:B00005T7I1 Dick Tracy]] than [[ASIN:B001EC0OQ8 The Maltese Falcon]], with fist fights, shootouts, and a car chase (with beautiful vintage 40's vehicle, naturally) that are as bloody and brutal as anything else in movies right now. While the movie may include a few clichés too many, or Ruben Fleischer (who directed Emma Stone in [[ASIN:B0030B624E Zombieland]]) may rely a few times too many on modern film tricks like slow motion and dizzying camera angles, \\"Gangster Squad\\" is the best entry in the genre in decades.
0061124265|4.0|After reading [[ASIN:B009XJS5B0 Dream Junkies]] another unique, fascinating novel about spiritual revivial triggered by love, I tackled Veronika Decides to Die, fearing that I would be dissapointed after the Alchemist. Although not an instant classic like The Alchemist - lacks it's magic - Vernonika's story is wonderful, inspiring, and worth reading. I highly recommend it, even if like me, you shy away from mega best sellers and you prefer the authenticity of indie works.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Can't wait to read book 2! I really enjoyed all the twists and turns  in this book. I didn't want to put it down.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I like it
B0081HLMD8|5.0|Amazon average rating: 4.5/5.0<br />Rotten Tomatoes rating: 92%/100%<br /><br />Based on these numbers I gave this movie a go. At first I wasn't happy with the movie but once the crazy \\"conspiracy\\" started, I was hooked! Excellent movie, easily 5/5 stars and I'm extremely glad I watched it. The ending was GREAT too!<br /><br />I hope the hollywood re-make does happen.  5/5 stars and will recommend to my friends!
B0001LJCMK|5.0|great album, not a bad song  on here. If you like queens of the stone age, you'll like this dude
B006LSZECO|2.0|No.  I got suckered in by all the good reviews and I can't believe how disappointing it turned out to be.  Loved the first third of it - but the rest and the end definitely didn't make it worth reading.  I was actually angry at the end!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|best drama ever
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This book was fantastic, held my attention throughout.  I now plan to read all the other Jack reacher books in the series.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. It was very thought provoking and beautifully written.
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Doesn't get much better than Ray LaMontagne!  I've only recently discovered his music (through an episode of Private Practice, go figure) and now I'm just thrilled with his sound.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Angry Birds definitely has a hit with this one!  even the evil laugh when you fail is fun!! They did the Star Wars franchise Proud!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|With all the twist and turns in the story it never has a lack of \\"I didn't see that coming\\" moments.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game because it starts out easy & gets more difficult. Even on the early stages you have concentrate, which is good! It makes you do 1 thing at a time instead of multitasking
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|3stars. This book did not have the novelty of the first. It still satisfied the reader in tying up the loose plot threads. We got a rebel victory, we got revenge on snow, and peeta and katniss come full circle, together in 12, planting the fragile seeds of  next generation
B008458O3S|4.0|makes you think and use deduction to win.  Makes for a interesting playing experience. My husband even likes it & he does not play games
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitary just to wind down a bit before bed. It will be a nice way to use up time at appointments.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The movies are great and the price was FABULOUS!! I recommend this to anyone who likes the movies. A great buy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play solitaire to pass away time.  It's wonderful that I have this on my android.  It's cool!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|One of my favorites books I've read! I like the many different &#34;layers&#34; to this story. It has magic, romance, beautiful imagery, a &#34;dark&#34; element, intrigue, etc., etc. - something that would appeal to everyone. Truly a great book! Can't wait to see what Ms. Morgenstern writes next.
B007KFZ7RE|4.0|I use this to workout to and it's great for that.  The songs are pretty similar so it might be a little boring for just listening.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Got tired of all the pop ups in between hands, very annoying<br />There has to be one which this doesn't occur.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved it!! It was such an interesting book. A little confusing to read at first but once you get the hang of it it's a breeze!
B004XGN8W4|4.0|Shipping was prompt and came well packaged. I was a little worried with it being a TV and all but had no problems. It’s perfect for my husband’s deployments. I did think there would have been a little more of a sound system but they are only speakers on the TV.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|Valuable and inspiring are thoughts on perseverance and attitude in long distance running as well as coocking recipies<br />General meanning of life considerations - slightly naive.<br /><br />As pure running book though - highly recommended.<br /><br />JanC
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Awesome! Great read and has the most power when you are at a place where you are ready to receive and want to use The Secret!
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app is basic weather info, pulled up my location no problem but I can't get more than th  36 he forecast
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Enjoyed the entire book from beginning to end. It kept me wanting to read more and more. Definitely recommend this book.
B003GAMOIW|1.0|I was not aware that a DVD that was made in the United Kingdom, will not work or play at all in a DVD Player that was made & purchased in the United States. That is my difficulty in this order / purchase. It is entirely my fault for the mistake. However, on the bright side, I have seen & really like the movie &#34; The Adjustment Bureau &#34; in the past. It's Fantastic & I highly recommend it !!
B005LAIIPS|2.0|This movie was the worst of the Bourne movies by far!!  It didn't have much action at all and the ones it did have were copy cats from the past Bourne movies.  The scene where he was running on roof tops while the doctor was running from the police has already been done!  The car/motorcycle chase immediately following has also been done.<br /><br />The other mistake that was made is that I wasn't bonded with the main character.  Unlike Bourne, you didn't know much about Aaron, nor are you invested in him.  So, you don't care what happens to him.<br /><br />Poor movie.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked almost every part but it was to long ! This was a lot over help and great to read.
B008YWY0HK|2.0|I love the Scottish accents, the characters, and quality of animation!  But the storyline was the typical boring storyline....Princess is forced to find a mate, doesn't want to get married, but forced by parents, finds true love!  Boring!  Been done for decades!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Though it's a typical waking up married in Vegas book, it's still different from the others. I really enjoyed reading it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was not as exciting asd I thought it would be since it was listed on the best sellers list of our local newspaper
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I like this book because the book could help u with words and helps u understand the words better and clearly
B000FC10WU|4.0|I have always liked the Miss Marple Mysteries it is the good old english tales with the proper English people in their very English settings.
B00A89ITZG|5.0|Good read, must buy for runners/Crossfitters. Ideas are solid. May take some adaptation but they work. Makes you truly look at what you are doing and how you should correct it. Provokes ideas you probably wouldn't have had.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys CD was awesome.  I recently saw a PBS concert special and bought these CD's for my family members for Christmas.  Good for all generations!
B00ANT6OK8|4.0|I have read and heard so much about this movie in the last 3-4 months, including that fantastic trailer, that I literally couldn't wait to see it for myself. I saw it this past weekend here in Cincinnati.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" (2012 release; 157 min.) brings the story of \\"the greatest man hunt in American history\\". As the movie opens we hear (but don't see) voices in distress as 9/11 is happening. The movie then moves to 2003, to a CIA \\"black site\\", where we get the first of a number of \\"enhanced interrogation scenes\\", including the infamous waterboarding techniques. We get to know Maya (played by Jessica Chastain), a young CIA operative who is tasked with trying to find Bin Laden. The years come and go, with very little progress. Then finally comes a breakthrough. Even though you know how it all ends, I don't want to give further plot details as it really woudl ruin your viewing experience.<br /><br />Several comments: the last hour and 10 min. of the movie is nothing short of riveting, truly the best movie-viewing you can get, but I felt that the first hour and a half were a bit excessive in length, and had that been edited tighter, it would've made for even a better movie. The \\"enhanced interrogations\\" scenes have proven to be quite controversial for many, but I thought it was an eye-opener to see what 'waterboarding' actually is. That aside, I am really glad that the movie makers have kept the politics out of the movie, and strictly focus on the nitty-gritty details of the hunt for Bin Laden. Last but not least, the real heroes of the movie are of course the Navy SEALs who come in at the end and take care of business, seemingly without as much as breaking a sweat. We owe these guys a ton of gratitude! Bottom line: even though it's a bit long for its own good, \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a MUST-SEE movie, period.
B009EA3JDM|5.0|Reading 'Struck by Lightning' was somewhat a similar experience to being struck by lightning in that it was short, to the point and dramatic. It had unexpected twists, even if (unfortunately like me) the ending has been spoiled for you. Also it was incredibly funny! This is the type of book you have to giggle at quietly in public. It was also touching and very inspiring at points. There are moments where it feels like Chris/Carson is talking straight at you asking you 'why not follow your dreams?' With all that said, the inspiring parts successfully avoid cliche (unlike myself) and are balanced nicely with the humour to make a quality read. Carson is a character you want to keep reading more of, his stories are interesting from start to end which makes it a breeze to read. Well done to Chris, yet again he has simultaneously inspired and entertained people from around the world!
B000JML7EC|5.0|I am 10, but this book was outrageously good. It has a stunning climax, a great plot, and a good falling action.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book keeps you in suspense. Hard to put down. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
B005LAJ212|5.0|If you've seen the TV epiosodes, this is a must have to relive all of the scheming and machinations that go into plotting pay-back. If you haven't seen the TV epiosodes get this collection first and enter the fascinating world of Emily thorn.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are amazing written. They demand your attention and keep. They are a must read for both men and women.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|A quirky sci-fi work with an interesting premise--a little far fetched to be sure, but that's what sci-fi is supposed to be. And this sci-fi flic is fun not of the gruesome genre.
B000FC13E0|2.0|An interesting concept, and as believable as always, but much of the book consisted of Crichton over-explaining his theory, resulting in long dull patches interspersed throughout an otherwise good story.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I expected strong performances from these actors and they did not disappoint. It takes it's time, but I think that was necessary in this story.
B00447G29S|5.0|We are new to the 3d world but so far this is one of the best 3d movies we have seen.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This was an interesting film yet I had to work at following it.  I think they should have resequenced some events. Quality performances by the actors.
B003L16FAE|1.0|First of all, this is not a review of the movie Predator, (I love the movie itself) it is a review of the version of the movie on Blu-Ray called The Ultimate Hunter Edition. This version of the blu-ray completely ruins the gritty rawness of the original film. I saw this movie (the original Predator) in the movie theaters several times back when it first came out, and I have to say, it had a really gritty and raw look to it that gave it it's whole mood, and it is one of the things that made it such a great movie. This blu-ray version is horrendous, and it totally takes all of the gritty raw atmosphere out of the movie and presents it as polished, plastic, waxy, sterile throughout and completely robs the film of all of its atmosphere and personality. This movie is not meant to be polished, plastic, and sterile... its SUPPOSED TO BE GRITTY and RAW like it was originally presented in the movie theaters. This is not supposed to look like a new shiny gleaming movie that has been completely sterilized, its supposed to look like a gritty and raw film.<br /><br />When they made this Ultimate Hunter's Edition blu-ray of Predator, with zero regard or respect, they took a big dump of the art of this film, and smeared waxy plastic all over it. It look horrible. If you are a fan of the original Predator and you saw this movie in the movie theaters when it originally came out, this version on blu-ray will make you sick, and angry at how they have completely destroyed the original integrity of this film and turned it into an embarrassing unwatchable display. This is the worse blu-ray edition of any movie ever!! Watching this blu-ray is not watching Predator...its watching a fake and false computerized version..and the way they went in and removed all evidence that this movie was even shot on film and tried to make it look like it was shot on video and then polished on a computer is completely disrespectful to the original intent film Predator and the original intent of this as a work of art.<br /><br />They should rename thins: Predator: The Ultimate Disrespect Edition.<br />They totally disregard and remove all of the personality out of this film just to try to sell it to the kids out there who want everything all sterile and clean and plastic looking with no personality to it.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS blu-ray, it terrible looking.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|My son loves these books, he wasn't much of a reader till I got him a few of these. Now all he wants is more ;-)
B002JM1VJG|5.0|the Madonna Celebration: The Video Collection is worthy of 5 stars even if there is one video that is censored, because this collection is cram packed with videos and all in great authentic quality. Don't let anyone dissuade you from getting this Madonna collection of music videos because they say it's\\"bad quality\\" because it's not at all bad quality. These are the way these music videos were made and meant to be seen. These videos are the original art, and not all destroyed by false and fake digital manipulation. I watched this on my 50\\" plasma with headphones and it is AWESOME!! A TRUE blast from the past!! I highly recommend getting Madonna Celebration: The Video Collection on dvd. Just buy it, you won't regret it, and you will have a great time watching these... especially if you were watching MTV in the early and mid 80s. This is also a great dvd collection because it shows how she has changed over the years when you start from the beginning and watch all the videos in order back to back when you click 'play all'<br /><br />I bought this thru Amazon and I have no complaints about these discs at all whatsoever. I thoroughly enjoy watching it and owning it. It's a great time!! ENJOY!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|i love hidden object games...and this one was very fun. i wish it was longer though! i had no problem finding objects and the clues made it essy to find them.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|it so cool  I love it I think everybody should get it. I whant. every one of them I love mindcraft
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have read this book multiple times. It pulls you in to the story with every little twist. I absolutely love this book and the author. Sharp objects is not for the light hearted but if you can h as handle it you will not be able to put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|sub way suffer is a great game to play if your looking for a good game to play on car rides and other stuff but you need a face book account to play a friend but it is still a fun game
1401922732|5.0|I really enjoy these cards...  I use the regular and I already include Archangel Michael in my prayers to &#34;GOD&#34; so afterwards when I do a session the answers reveal what is going on from him - just believe...
0765325950|5.0|A perfect ending to one of the greatest fantasy series ever written. Thank you Brandon Sanderson for finishing Jordan's masterpiece.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|My first go around with the old cloud player was not the best experience. Since Amazon put out their new cloud player I'm impressed and sold on it. I went ahead and joined Amazon Prime and find it so much easier now to play my music from the cloud player on any of my devices. Thanks Amazon!
B007OLYQ4E|3.0|I bought this book after a discussion with my daughter about Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly. It was a good, quick read and reading it resolved the disagreement we had about Golightly's character.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was so much better than I thought it was going to be! I wish that there was a sequel.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I think it was a good combo of the comics and needs to b more of the same sequal as to diffrent endings for each character
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This was a gift for granddaughter and she loves it. She is seven and enjoys her make believe movies. This movie is a family favorite.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I can read books on my phone.  There are many, many free books to download and read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show continues to be fantastic. just enough balance of action and drama. Can't wait for the new season. Lots of plot twists that I never saw coming!!!
B004HO6I4W|4.0|this was given as a gift and the kids seemed very happy.  Recieved this on time per the dilevery time quoted.
B000H1RFKA|5.0|I don't know how I missed this movie. Never heard of it before I was randomly browsing through some DVDs to buy. My husband also liked it. Hilarious, serious, action packed.
0307474712|2.0|Although it was a very addictive read, it was a guilty addiction; the two main character are pathetic, and unlikeable. They seem to have only weak traits, constantly waiting for chance and rarely making any decisions for themselves. The frequent references to classic literature is interesting and relevant, but Em and Dex are stereotypically cute-smart-funny-yet-insecure girl and well-meaning-yet-childish-and-selfish boy. The ending is, however, clever and changes one's perspective on the overall story.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Have not gotten to a very high level but have already<br />had some challenges.  It looks so simple and that is how<br />you make your mistakes or at least it is for me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is very good read with many twists and turns. It had a surprise ending that was rather upsetting to me.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I really do like face book.  See what friends are doing.  Catch up with old friends<br />and meet new friends.  Plus there are games here also.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|OK. A nice watch, bit unconventional, but not really sure why it got nominated for an Oscar. Oh, because now they nominate ten &*!@! movies
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It is nice to be able to look and see what the weather is doing.<br />Sometimes helps you plan better what you may need to take
B0094BB4TW|3.0|it is difficult to use. The directions are hard to understand. I need a course on how to set it up, in plain english
B008XG1X18|3.0|I really like this app.  Shows lots of craft things for kids, holidays and<br />even though I am not very crafty this does give lots of ideas and to<br />talk them over with your friends is nice.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I really enjoyed the action of the movie and it included some great shots and scary scenes that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like this game. it is fun that you can get more points when you just keep trying. i also like how these r gsmes that make you think and that also helps to pass the time. i really enjoy this game.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Seriously, I know this is late to the party and all, and hell I bought it in hardcover and digital, being the sucker that I am, but this book goes nowhere and does  nothing.  It's a shame, the first 3 books in the series were excellent, the last two, iffy at best and bordering on absolute crap at worst (Where do whores go, for example).  Oh well.  I might give his next one a try, IF it comes out, but I'll be waiting for full blown reviews of it before purchasing.  I do that with video games, why not books?
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I am enjoying reading Hopeless.  It flows well, and the reader can relate to it's story..  It would appeal to young adults as well as older teens.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hadn't seen the movie I wanted to read the book first .From the first page to the last I couldn't put it down
0345803485|3.0|I began to read it, but put it down, and started on other books instead.  From others who have read it, I don't feel like it is what I want to read..especially when many have said you have to read the trilogy to appreciate the story.
B005O7PXNS|4.0|Love Castle, love the writing - the twists and turns, as well as the chemistry between Castle and Beckett.  And this episode had all that in spades.  Definitely makes me want to keep watching!
0385742886|5.0|I bought this series as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it! She had just asked for 1 or 2 of the 4 book series but when I saw that I could get all 4 for about $40 2 of which are hard covers I jumped on it! She had already read the Hunger Games series and get this...she is in the 6th grade reading at a 9th grade level! She gets so excited reading these books that when she discovers something new she runs to me telling me what happened like it's real life! I would not be a bit surprised if they make a movie out of these books as well. I will do anything I can to encourage her love for reading and to find them all at 1 place at a discount, from the comfort of my own home. What a blessing. 2 words: Thanks Amizon!
B00080Z53O|5.0|This is a powerful film. It is not for the faint-hearted, but it is for those that don´t mind being challenged to think. It can be a little depressing but well worth it.

B000B0WO0I|5.0|What a fabulous album!! I hadn´t heard Simply Red´s stuff for a while, and loved this one. It contains a great combination of music and songs, and is a pleasure to which to listen. Highly recommend it for Simply Red fans.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I bought this for my boyfriend, he really loved it except the wrist band was too scratchy.  It would probably wear down with time but he switched the bands.
B0000AM6LY|5.0|Gotta love Simply Red! I loved adding this one to my collection. I play it in the car, as I do ¨Simplified¨and they make my drive anywhere a pleasure.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Love this movie!! If your a fan of the musical,  you will love the movie. The surround sound in our living room was amazing with this movie, especially the mirror scene and scene with Title song. Made it sound like the phantom was right next to you! Ill admit though if you don't like a lot of singing you wont enjoy or understand the story. But overall I enjoyed this haunting love story :)
B000024O26|5.0|I bought this for a friend who had given his album to his sister. My friend and I were living in England the year this was released, so it was meaningful. I replaced it for him because it´s a must-have!
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|I was a little disappointed. The story was very predictable, nothing surprising happened. But special effects and execution were ok.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Useful! I like how extensive the updates are. Hour by hour, day by day. Living in a place where weather is unpredictable as it is, I need this.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I thought this would be a nice romantic comedy and I didn't find it all that funny or romantic.  Although I like both actors, I felt that this movie was not their best work.
B004RE29PO|5.0|This is one is a must have movie for any new BD player. Very good picture quality, awesome sound and great price.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I loved this book so much that I would recommend it to the president of the United states and I would recommend this book for 4 stars because I read more than 1,000,000 books so far so I would defiantly recommend it to the president of the United states!
B009CG955Y|5.0|my kids and i love this movie. they have watched it repeatedly. this is such a wonderful movie. great quality on my kindle.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|My children are 3 and 5 years old. This movie scared them to death. There is allot of magic in the movie as well as scary bears. I would NOT recommend this movie to a friend.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this app!  I can play this game for hours.  My daughter tries to take my Kindle and play, but she has to get in line!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|20 word min. Blah! Great game though. Sure beats playing on an itouch.<br />First time playing m c on my kindle &amp; loving it
B0010TBPJU|5.0|I hate musicals but I LOVE this movie!<br /><br />Excellent original film and music, brilliant previously unknown cast.<br /><br />1 of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.
0988262592|4.0|I was sent an advanced review copy of The The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win by co-author Gene Kim and I can honestly say that it was one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time. The novel, written by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford, not only combines an interesting story with sound business practices, it also teaches the reader about risk evaluation, critical thinking, and how manufacturing processes can translate to IT operations, development, and, of course, DevOps.<br /><br />The characters in the book were easy to relate to and I suspect that if you have not yet worked for or with an individual depicted in the book in your career, you likely will at some point. Both the heroes and protagonists were easy to spot and I found myself genuinely rooting for the heroes throughout the course of the book.<br /><br />If I have one criticism about the combined work, it's that throughout the book the characters had very negative views towards developers and the historic disconnect between IT ops, security, developers, and the senior decision makers. This was something that I had hopped would evolve into, at the very least, a sense of mutual respect and appreciation for their skills, talents, and issues by the end of the novel. Part of me would like to see a parallell sequel written that depicted the same story from the view of the software people.<br /><br />I recommend that anyone involved in any line of business read this book. Similarly, any person working within an organization will be able to learn something new about how their business operates. It shows the inner workings of how business decisions are prioritized and will help people relate to the decisions made in their own company.<br /><br />Business leaders will almost certainly find a gem or two to help them optimize their existing business practices and perhaps even streamline their IT operations and product deliverables. I wouldn't be surprised to see this book as the basis for future MBA or executive education tracks as I think, though the individual concepts may currently be presented, the combined work presents itself as a seminal case study into optimizing business by automating IT.to see this book as the basis for future MBA or executive education tracks as I think, though the individual concepts may currently be presented, the combined work presents itself as a seminal case study into optimizing business by automating IT.
0307352145|1.0|This book reassured me that I am not alone. I plan to re-read and highlight places that resonate with my experience as well as places that offer encouragement.
0395389496|5.0|I purchased 17 of these to give to all my moms great grandchildren.  sight unseen.  they were lovely when they came.  they had a cd inside and an ornament so were wonderful gifts.  where else can you buy 17 books at one time - Amazon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of those books that you can't put down. From start to end its a awesome book. Definitely recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book left me breathless, it was a page turner that I could not put down until it was finished.  Sky and Holder are awesome characters, and as hard as the subject matter in this book is not the normal good feel reading at times.  Colleen Hoover really brought the subject matter to life and made you feel the pain, love, sacrifice and second chances as they happened.  A recommended good book to read, it was work it from beginning to end.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This has been a wonderful experience both with my brand new Kindle Fire and the book itself.  I have always been interested in this period in history and Stephen King has once again put a new spin on things!!!
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I got this book while waiting for the 3rd book to come out in the latest trilogy by Follett.  I have found that I really enjoy his books and wonder why it took me so long to start reading him.  I think my interest lies in the period he writes about, during the 2nd world war.  Understanding it is fiction, but if things had actually worked out the way he describes them, Wow!  It lets you understand some of the issues at the time.<br /><br />I really enjoy them, and look forward to his next new release.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This book was good I chose a good book and it was amazing.<br /><br />From everybody favorite cossy catanzaro the monster and the Asian that is human bug man kind from the ages and year that has parted past us from the beginning and the end from life to rock from skin to ashes from bone to skin from kids to parents from infants to baby from hospital to room from candel light to lightbulb and from earth to heaven
B0015DROBO|4.0|Wow!  I had looked at this book forever and really didn't think I would be interested in it.  But once I started reading it, I couldn't put it dowm.  The cast of characters is awsome!  The computer gal is a nutcase, but what a gal!  She steals the story.  I am lookijng forward to reading the other two books in this trilogy!<br /><br />I would reccommend this one to anyone with a strong stomach, but not for the weak at heart!  Great story.<br /><br />Shame Steig had to pass, he was a tremendous author and one I could have read for the rest of my days!
1439156816|5.0|This is my favorite book to date on writing. The book itself is a great lesson (example) of how to write interesting non-fiction. The beginning part covers a bit about the author's life that led to his career. I was not interesting in that before reading it, but found it very enjoyable to read. The second half covers the art of writing and is packed with little nuggets of wisdom. There is a bit at the end about publishing that is a bit dated and was not all that valuable to me, however, that was a tiny portion of the book.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|When this came out we thought it would be a good family movie. My one daughter enjoyed it, the rest of us thought it was really boring.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a good book about a very sad case. I lived in the Bay area when this happened and I remember like it was yesterday, all the attention that was paid to this abduction. I'm extremely glad she was found alive, and to hear her story of survival is a real tear jerker, but it is also a story of the ultimate triumph of life.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This movie has a great storyline and a great cast.  Has a good twist to the ending as well.  Definitely worth watching.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|Great set!  Adds to the set of bricks my grandson received.  New dimension for him to use in his creations..
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my 7yr old son.  It's a bit too complicated for him at the moment.  I know he will get there soon though.<br /><br />Or at least he would get there if I could put it down.  I feel like a kid again, &#34;just one more try before dinner, I'll be right there!&#34;<br /><br />This toy is a frustrating bunch of awesome fun.  If you like puzzles, you'll enjoy this.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book has love ,personal struggles,a little botany, and a great message . I savored every minute of this well written story.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|At first I had the weather channel from the UK. What a mistake. Then I corrected the problem and now I have the info that I need.
1577314808|5.0|I purchased this book in six months ago and have read it probably sixteen times since then. I highly recommend it.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This game is just okay to me as I have not mastered this game yet. I will continue to try to improve my skills.
B0086700CM|5.0|I downloaded this FREE game onto my Kindle.  The graphics and scrolling are amazing.  I find myself running thru the maze from time to time.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was a good movie, a little predictable but what do you expect from a talking bear. Worth the money, I would see it again.
B006UW4OB8|5.0|Like everyone else, I have scores of passwords for everything.  More and more, websites are asking us to change our passwords frequently.  Some require mixed case and numbers.  I even have one that that requires at least one special character.  eWallet to the rescue.  All you have to remember is your MASTER Password to get into eWallet, then all the rest are at your fingertips.  I have  been using eWallet for years and love it.  Locate the website you want to visit in the eWalet vault and click on it's URL link.  Most of the time, eWallet loads the webpage and fills in the userid and password.  Worst case is you wind up on the login page and you have to fill it it.  I have eWallet on three computers, my Android phone and Kindle too.  eWallet syncs all the devices easily by WiFi or USB.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love it and use it every day. Not anything bad to say about it. I think everyone should use Evernote.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Sometimes it pays to wait a while.  When this movie first came out on DVD, it was quite expensive.  Now that it is a classic, the price dropped.  I completed my collection for less than 8 bucks delivered.  How good is that.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|is great for waking me up for school considering I always hit snooze it makes me do math so it wakes up teenagers every time.
B009X01C64|5.0|I got a Kindle for Christmas.  It does not stand up by itself.  It is smoothe all around so it is not really friendly to hold onto.  I got this Case and like it very much.  It allows for vertical and horizontal standing at various angles.  I provides padding to protect against shock.  It is made of soft leather and provides a nice feel.  All in all a good buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids who are 10 and 5 both love this game. I have even played it. It is so worth getting!
0156027321|5.0|I read this book and saw the movie in 2012.  I sent my sister this copy for Christmas.  What else can one say?
B005DOKIYG|3.0|What can I say about a zip sleeve?  It fits, it seems durable, I'm sure it will hold up just fine.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I got this for my fiance.  She plays it all the time on her Androd phone.  She is happy to play it on the Kindle as the screen is so much larger.
B006LSZECO|3.0|For someone who watches and reads a lot of whodunit type novels, I thought it started out as a pretty typical tale.  But as the plot unfolds you become more aware of the twists and the twisted.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book will touch your heart and even make you cry. The story tells of two youth who are completely devoted and in love with one another-- until one of them is killed. It is a addicting read that will have you thinking about your first love.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just watch episode one from season one- on Netflix and hulu.. I can't explain.. But its that good!! Maybe u can watch episode 1 season 1 for free on Amazon! So glad I bought season 2 with Amazon instant video!! I downloaded an app for my iPad and it plays perfect!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of my favorite books ever; I began the book and loved the two main characters and, then, I hated Nick with a passion and mid-book, I hated his wife as well. With more twists than Chubby Checker and more evil than Beelzebub, this is a fast paced, current and addictive novel that I hated to finish (although I HATED the ending).
B007OWRBJK|1.0|I love Pete Townshend. I love his attitude and the way he tells stories. However, NONE of that comes across in this book! It's mostly long boring stories about his childhood, and details that no one could possibly care about.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It's a good book, it took a while to get going, but when it did, it really took off.  Kind of a &#34;wow&#34; moment happens.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I thought Brave was an incredible movie. It shows how a parent and child can butt heads yet still really love each other. My 7 year old and 5 year old were scared by the movie. They both are to a point that they understand death is final or a friend moving away is extremely sad. Watching the daughter beg her mother not to leave her was incredibly sad for my boys. They did not want to watch the movie again. My husband and I loved the movie because it showed our sons that we would go to the ends of the earth and beyond for them. And I think they got it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. it is tons of fun to play and lots of things to choose from. you will have a good time.
0375831002|5.0|This was a great book and the quality of it was surprisingly really really really really really really really good.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This is a collection of postings from the authors blog, but Inc  to have. Still, she also has a book out so one might consider that instead. I was hoping for bit more how too, but she had some great points
1939416019|4.0|I am currently reading this book and I really enjoy it.  Morgan writes such great stories.  They are easy to read and follow.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my godchildren both play minecraft and love it.  The 10 year old is building libraries, putting photos on walls, designing beautiful houses and gardens.  Keeps him creative. The older godson also enjoys playing minecraft. Definitely worth buying.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|As always, Hilarious!  This is about the only show I watch on live TV... although sometimes work refuses to allow it.  Now, finding the most recent episode on Amazon means not having to wait for the DVDs.<br /><br />Definitely Laugh Out Load... too funny for just a LOL!  The 6th season, with all the characters, has really hit its stride.  The show just keeps getting more funny (didn't think that possible, but it is!).
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I think this book wad very well written. I like the characters, especially the always charming Augustus Waters, but I was hoping the dialogue would be less sappy considering the extreme conditions of the main characters. The ending was sweet but not what I thought would happen, so I wad a little thrown off by that I suppose.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Too bad I never watched it when it was on the air, but I love this show!  For nerds everywhere (and closet nerds), Chuck is a relate-able hero.  This show has lots of action and even more humor.  I highly recommend it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|GREAT APP,  JUST SET YOUR LOCATION AND THE APP WILL DO THE REST.  I t gives you the temp for your location and the forecasts for three next two weeks, along with a great map.
B001AK3S4Y|5.0|If you want a movie dealing with the struggle between good/evil and the ability of mankind to make that decision (self determination), this is the movie. Great graphics and great character development.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I was told by others that it was a good movie, but I guess I expected more.  Overall for the films done in 2012, it was not bad.  Still love Johnny Depp !!!!
B001F7MSFM|5.0|Great movie, great quality. Deals with humanity's choice between right and wrong. Graphics are incredible and acting is superb. I look forward to the next movie.
1455502758|4.0|I found it an absolutely wonderful read, and quite inspirational.  Christopher Hitchens goes through his own experience of how what it is like to get cancer, and its treatment in an honest and poignant manner. My only criticism of this book is that his opening essay is very similar to the beginning of Susan Sontag's classic work, Illness as Metaphor. Nonetheless, it is a well written account of a man who is close to death written in an articulate manner. We must always confront death, and this book reminds us how precious time really is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. My favorite of the 3, I thought that the second was a lengthened version of the first but in 50 shades freed there is so many other things that happen!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I got my case and I can't even put it on silent. I also put a paper towel in the case and tested it underwater and the paper towel got wet. The worst thing about it is that the screen is wavy-like so I have to press down hard on top of some letters whilst texting because the screen is far above my actual phone screen. I wish I never wasted money on it.
B00846REIS|5.0|i loved this book!! i don't know if i would say 'more' than 50 shades of grey but they're not really the same! the scorching hot love scenes are those that could actually be attainable to normal people. not with the bondage, just straight up hot romance! can't wait for #3!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun and easy to play on my kindle. Graphics good. Wish I could avoid the ads. This is a good game for kindle
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely cannot wait for Entwined with You. I am counting down the days until May 7, but staying hopeful that it could still come out early (fingers crossed). Gideon and Eva's relationship takes such an incredible turn in this book that I really can't wait to read more.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like this App. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it freezes up a little too often.
B00AYDC5HY|1.0|Sad, pointless and just a waste of time. Worst movie I have seen in a long while. The plot is thin, it is basically just a bunch of cliches strung together over a backstory of sad kids who's pets have died. Never should have been made. Wish I could get my time and money back.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Easy to read and entertaining. A bit predictable, but I am going to be reading the second and third books.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I'm satisfied.  My son's favorite movie by a longshot . . . . . . . . . . .
B00144VBBS|5.0|This is wonderful.  Absolutely great.  Love Toby's Music and this is the best!  Every country music lover should have it.
B00A7CF1QY|1.0|I had such high hopes for this movie. I hoped it would be interesting and explain more of the mythology from the previous movies. Nope. It was really one big chase scene. Auch a shame. I would be happy to pay gain for another movie with a better director and a writer.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|The best of the best!  Can't beat it.  So classic - so great!  The name says it all.  Wish he would make more music like he did.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob: A Novel was interesting and well written.  I did not expect the way it ended. I would recommend this book.
B009LA1R34|5.0|In my opinion, this is Thalia's best album from the songs to interpretation. Its mature. Love the first five songs specially!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|For a free app, this offers an amazing array of sounds you can choose from. The quality of the sounds are also excellent, and I especially enjoy the feature where you can DJ your own Zen/rain/flute (or what-have-you!) track. I love falling asleep to this. So relaxing. &#60;3
1849163863|5.0|I read this book after reading a very favorable revue in the NY Times. This book was great, terrific plot and subplots. I have just received his next in this series, The Lewis Man, and it almost picks up where Black House ended. Again the Hebrides, and a body found preserved by the ecology of the island. I will pick up my reading later today. I enjoy this series much more than the China series or his series in France with Enzo.  They were too convoluted and distant. This series has the best characters and plot and subplots. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|good game but way too short for the price.  not really a hidden object game and puzzles were fairly easy.
B009HELT3C|4.0|There were a few corny, reused jokes from the rest of the series that didn't really fit the movie. Beyond that however, this movie had some excellent plot twists that I didn't expect, and I was pleasantly surprised in the way it concluded. All in all, it was a good movie.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The book moved along very well, I love fantasy if it is well done and this was. He had an interesting and refreshing life, magic, and tracking down his enemy. It was very colorful and leaves me wanting more
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Very informative and up to date with the info I want. Good choices to choose from.Easy to navigate through the pages.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|SHE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGERS,WHAT A VOICE SHE HAD. IF I HAD TO PICK ONE FEMALE SINGER THAT HAD THE BEST VOICE OVERALL. I WOULD PICK HER. WHAT A TALENT, AND THE PRICE COULD NOT BE BEAT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|it was her continued good work . I keeps your interest from the start. If she does another one I'll be there.
B0027MJU00|5.0|First of her books I've read, Good book, well written, I thoroughly enjoyed it! Looking forward to reading more by Gillian Flynn.
B00915G6SU|5.0|I chose this rating because i love love love me some criminal minds and will continue to buy every season!
B004SGWYW4|4.0|This is a fairly dark anime series.  As you can guess, it's about zombies and the main characters are highschoolers.  There's intense blood and gore from the start and a lot of drama between the living characters.  This series is also very perverted and is full of fan service and nudity.
B00846REIS|5.0|Such a excellent read! Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a great story with very erotic moments. Not for the light of heart. I can't wait to see what the next book tells about Eva and Gideon. Loved, loved, loved it!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was watched more than once over the Christmas Break and It is very witty.  A really good comedy that deserves more attention.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|If you are looking for a nice easy read with lots of emotional content then this is your book. Absolutely recommended.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this CD and plan to watch the series over and over.  I have watched one or two episodes over already and always pick up things I missed the first time.  There is so much going on it kind of makes me dizzy but love it.<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS FROM TIGGARO, BINKIBONS IS MY DAUGHTER.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I really enjoy this game. there is a wide variety of food and decorations.  I appreciate the holiday themes but do wish they would be available sooner.  I also wish it wouldn't be so difficult to obtain parts to build ovens.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love everything about this app. I use it all the time... Love the plans and all the different versions... Honestly, can't think of anything I don't like about it
B006LSZECO|1.0|Not worth the time.  You know that you're reading fiction but the story line is so ridiculous it's comical.  Like a bad soap opera.
0060574216|5.0|My son was given the choice of a few books for a project and I chose this for him.  He was skeptical, but after he read it, said it was really, really good.  You'll enjoy it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't normally bother with book reviews, but Amazon doesn't simply allow me to rate without a review.<br />I've never read any of Stephen King's books, but I really enjoyed this one!<br />Even though it was 850ish pages long, I was hooked.
1451648537|4.0|Easy to read and hard to out down until it's done. But you have to be a fan of Apple or Steve Jobs to really appreciate it.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This was book 2 of a novelty trilogy that I could have done without. I read it for book club. We had a good laugh and that was the end of it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching fire was a phenomenal book. I always get nervous with middle books in a series, but this one grabbed my attention and wouldn't let go. I'd write more but I'm off to start the final chapter in this trilogy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow, just keeps getting better and better!! What a twist and cliff hanger at the end! Can't  wait to get 3rd book!
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|INCREDIBLE musician.  If you ever have a chance to see him live, do it.  You won't regret it, and will live in awe.
B00288KNJU|5.0|A little weird on the story line, but the 3d was great and this set included everything needed for it! Tim Burton is fantastic.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|thank you for making this app it is helpfull when doing homework and such really thank you<br /> emma l p.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter once again delivers! Great season and super excited to see what season 7 has in store for us!!!! Must watch show for sure!!!!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thought we loved Downton and now season 2.... they have outdone themselves! Seasone 2 is by far my favorite but I love it all!!! This is a must see for sure!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Best I've read on NDE's.  His story is astounding....his medical death and return to full function is unprecedented.  His journey to heaven is wonderfully reassuring to me.
0345803485|5.0|Buy it in paperback if you fly often and don't like to be disturbed while reading on your ipad or other e-Reader at take-off and landing.<br /><br />Real books smell nice too, nostalgic.  Although, if you're the type to become embarrassed reading these books in public you might want to make a nice book cover for it.  E-readers provide a certain amount of privacy, paperbacks advertise your literary choices.
030758836X|3.0|I just finished reading Gone Girl. I spent the better part of a day devouring this novel...could not put it down and finished it in 2 days. Well..imagine my surprise at that ending!!! It's like the author lost all her writing ability at the end and said 'screw it' - and just made up an awful ending that did not match the rest of the tone of the book. Still for 95% of the book it was a page turner!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Wonderfully bewitching with twists & turns in every chapter.  Can't wait to start book two...right now!!  Hello again to my reason for losing sleep each night :)
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone who is an introvert and anyone who knows an introvert!  It will vastly improve how you move through your days.  If enough people read and understand it, this book could transform so many lives.
159420411X|4.0|Nate Silver runs 538 doing election predictions.  He has been very accurate and closely watched in 2012 and previous elections.  His accuracy on election predictions brought attention to his skills as a forecaster.  Mr. Silver's book is full of messages about the difficulty of making forecasts and predictions, the importance of probability analysis, self-awareness and humility for good decision making<br /><br />Uncertainty is an irreducible variable about reality.  Human condition hates uncertainty.  Most people and experts find the lack of clarity about the future to be upsetting.  Understanding the world completely is impossible for humans.<br /><br />There is a regular tendency to overestimate the amount of signal vs. noise in the environment.  Big data is shrinking the signal-to-noise ratio.  Noise is increasing and usable information is becoming more challenging to find.<br /><br />Human events are not becoming more predictable.  Technology enables more analysis at the same time that societies become more complex.  Economists often do not even know what the state of the economy is in the present (uncertain initial conditions).  Economic forecasts are not improving and economic data can be very noisy.  Degree of leverage in an economic system can compound problems.<br /><br />Probability is an important concept in building models for forecasting.  Rationality is based on probabilistic expectations.  Probability is a way point between ignorance and knowledge.  Probability is a necessary way to manage the imperfections of the human senses and perception.  It is difficult to assess the difference between the improbable and impossible.<br /><br />Models serve two purposes: prediction and to develop insights.  Sophisticatedly simple models are good.  Update models and predictions with new information.  \\"When the facts change, I change my mind.\\" - John Maynard Keynes<br /><br />A good decision maker and predictor needs to be aware of and conscious of what they do notknow.  Be humble about predictive capability.  Adjust for new information.  Hubris leads to overconfidence about predictions.  The delta between what we know and what we think we know is important.  Self-awareness is key.  Awareness of bias is important to building knowledge and making good predictions.  Important traits of good decision makers: reason, learn, imagine, flexible.<br /><br />Financial markets are efficient, inefficient and subjective to bubbles and manias because they are made up of the collective rationality and biases of individuals.  Investors are overconfident in their predictions.  Markets are right most of the time, but not all of the time.  Markets can suffer from herd behavior.  This behavior can be rational to the individual based on their incentives.  Herd behavior and over-confidence together enable the building of bubbles.  Markets can remain irrational longer than an investor can stay solvent. - John Maynard Keynes.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Lights do not work.<br />It is obvious to first look that it is a fake. The materials, letters and colors do not look like original PS3 controllers.<br />I have to believe that if LEDs failed, then controller is going to fail at some point.<br /><br />All PS3 controller reviews that i read before buying this was pointed to any with a PS3 controller be that pink, blue or red are junk, well this is one is the same thing. I advise not to buy a stand alone controller.<br /><br />I bought this one and not the Red, Blue or any other alone because i did not wanted to spend money on a game combo.<br />However without intended to advertise the game combos with controller, i will advise to purchase one of those instead of an alone controller which is definitely going to be a fake. The combo is a Sony made offer that i will trust to have all original, a single controller, you will not know where the seller got it from.
B00979CS50|5.0|As a huge Neil Young fan, feel like this album stands up to the other Crazy Horse albums in my collection. Especially second disc. Both are very good, don't get me wrong. Highly recommend to Neil Young fans.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Wow, I am so hooked.  I have been playing catchup via the Amazon Season purchases and I have had the most entertaining moments this past holiday season just viewing the first 3 seasons and season 4 is just as good as the first three.
B0002HZSMQ|4.0|I'm a grown up who's always loved dinosaurs, so I bought myself this little guy. His coloring's a bit weird, at least since Spielberg's raptors are the ones ingrained in my memory, but he's pretty sturdy and doesn't have any obvious seams or flaws. He's kind of difficult to stand up on his own, though.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I realize why people love it.<br />It's simple, engaging and addictive.<br />It's appeal is universal and all age groups can enjoy it.
1611133408|5.0|My daughter is 6 and she is hooked.  We are on the 4th of 8 CDs.  We listen to it every time we get in the car.  I am also enjoying it.  It is well written and well read.  Fairy tale magic.
B009O2XY12|4.0|This is a great game, very addictive though! lol having to wait for more lives is a bummer though !
0671646788|5.0|I would recommend this book almost to everyone.  The great way to build confident and distroy fear.  Great attitude positive impact in peoples lives.
B00110K62U|5.0|Had never seen the play but knew the story. The first time I saw this on PBS, I loved it. It carries every emotion to the viewer. Great!!!!!!!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|While it's name might imply it's another kind of Angry Birds, it is nothing like the game which made these piggies famous.  The rounds were dull, not too complicated, and made me want to go play something else, rather quickly.
0316227706|5.0|Bought this as a gift for a friend who is a pet lover. She had never seen the photos and took delight page after page of these unique and interesting photos. Perfect as a coffee table book to keep handy for flipping through. Sure to bring a smile to your face every time you look at the photos!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|For every Star Wars fan, aspiring geek, and Angry Bird fan, this addition was a funny way of mixing two genres into something very entertaining for fans of either.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Bought for the grand kids to watch over the Christmas break!<br />This item arrived on time, just as described!<br />Thanks!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is a nice filler when you have a few minutes to kill and don't want to start reading.  The dragons are cute, the gameplay not too difficult.  My only real complaint is the need of an internet connection simply to open up the game and play.
0765325950|1.0|I am actually one of the persons that gave this a one star review and find it strange that so many people are offended with the fact that I have not read the book.  Not counting the large amount of trolls that I'm sure jumped on the bandwagon.  Having the option to rate my displeasure with the decisions made by the people providing this product seems only fair.  I am not rating the books story and my review shows, I am reviewing the company and its decisions.<br /><br />My Analogy from the title sums this up for me.  There is a great foreign movie that gets released in your country but the production company decides not to include any subtitles in your language.  It's a great story and movie but the production company decides they can get to the #1 spot by selling the original and then later the subbed one.<br /><br />TOR wants people to spend money on the hard cover, and whoever else went along with it.  I've read all the other books but I'm not sure I will read this one, at least not until I can get it at the library.  At which point I can review the story of the book and not just the company and it's horrible choices.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|Thickness is similar to highlighters and dry erase markers which is perfect for adults and kid(s) (my 5 year old likes it) and it has a rubber feel coating. This particular styli has a weight to it (almost the weight of a roll of dimes) which also gives great balance. The tip is not replaceable (as far as I can see after inspecting the tip). When you push down on the tip, you will feel a hard material preventing the tip to push inward.<br /><br />I was debating on the Bamboo stylus pens, but found the video reviews of the Cosmonaut more informative than of the Bamboo models.<br /><br />Using this with &#34;Paper - Fifty Three (53)&#34; App.
075669812X|5.0|My kids love ninjago and thought the book was fantastic, they didnt put it down for 2 days.  All the lego character encyclopaedia's are great.
B008B8A9V8|5.0|Love learning new tech. easy to read and follow,----- forget the review, short and sweet that's the way i say things, this required # of words is not cool :(
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This was a good sequel, but not as good as Matched in my opinion.  The back and forth in Ky and Cassia's perspective made it a little confusing at times and it was a bit slow in some parts.  Still a good, quick read.  I'm ready for the conclusion!
0385342063|5.0|I bought this book for my girlfriend, and she said this is definitely worth to buy, another amazing story from Sophie Kinsella
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I recently discovered this show after seeing a few episodes aired as part of a &#34;Castle Marathon&#34;.  I've bought all 5 seasons and watched every episode at least once.  Love the new season, with Castle and Beckett finally together, and navigating the challenges of a relationship while continuing to be the dynamic crime solving duo that is easy on the eyes.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Fun to read with more characters introduced. The ending was a shock but the first and middle part are just add ons to make the book longer. A bit disappointed. I can't wait to read the last part.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A fun way to pass time and challenge your mind!  A good game for all levels!  Spider Solitaire is a winner!
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|I Love this book<br /> THE book is so funny and hilarious.<br />It feels like I'm watching Greg's life. I like that Uncle Gary is the DG of the Valentine Dance
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I've been hooked for awhile and love this game. Watched it for a month looking for a sale and nabbed it for almost 50% off. The pieces fit together great and my family played it numerous times over the holidays (so much so we had to buy another copy for them to keep). My only comment is that if you buy an expansion pack MAKE SURE THE PIECES FIT TOGETHER WELL before taking it home. If the pieces do not fit together EXACTLY this game goes from a pleasure to a pain as you try to keep it from falling apart.
B008BM9L72|5.0|A book I could not put down. It was sexy and compelling, I am pleased that I bought the Trilogy, otherwise I would have been frustrated not being able to continue with the story!
B009JBWOU0|4.0|A cheap and great buy, it is the DVDs and it was nice for me to have a complete trilogy all in one box. The art booklet is short (if you are interested in it buy the full one) and the cover was pretty nifty. A great buy for any Dark Knight lover.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book as much as \\"Slammed\\" and \\"Point of Retreat\\" . Amazing story. I'm officially in love with Holder. ;)
B004GYY714|5.0|Wonder, woke up Sunday Morning put on my Kindle 90.7 and listened to Gospel.  Love it.  Highly recommed it to everyone.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Play this game all the time on my sisters computer along with Bookworm.  Love it, love it, love it.  Great fun for rainy days or just setting aroung relaxing.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Wish i would of got the blue ray comes in two discs thats what killed it awsome movie though fast delivary get the blue ray version great movie classic aswell !
B001AQO3QA|5.0|these blu rays look awesome,the audio quality(dts HD master audio 5.1) its not overbearing,it is very balanced in my opinion,which is good ,everything from voices to booming bass sounds well balanced,the packaging is very cool,made pretty well with a nice cardboard slip case and a book type deal housing the bluray discs....2 whole discs of special features,which is always a plus....so this set is great ,i recommend picking this up ....

1451696191|5.0|In the story, Perks of Being a Wallflower by Steven Chbosky published in 1999 by MTV Books, the main character Charlie lives life in highschool. In the beginning of the story, he was considered a loser. He had one friend until he died and then he was alone. When he started 9th grade, he met some new friends. Sam and Patrick. Charlie though that Sam was beautiful and that he loved her even though she was dating an older guy named Craig. Patrick had an on and off relationship with the quarterback of the football team. Sam and Patrick would skip classes with their friends and go smoke. Charlie would stand with them and talk and eventually he started smoking.<br /><br />Charlie met new friends when he went to parties. At these parties, people would smoke and drink and do drugs. Charlie did too.<br />One girl asked him to a dance and he said yes. It was Mary Elizabeth. They went to the dance and then they started dating. They would hang out a lot and buy each other gifts.<br /><br />Throughout the story, charlie talks about his aunt Helen and how she would let them watch tv late at night. When his birthday comes around, he is very sad because his birthday is the day that she died and he missed her. He gets very depressed and drives to her grave and cries there. He missed her a lot because she was a nice loving person but she was gone.<br /><br />Charlie also has a sister and an older brother. His brother is off in college playing football. His sister is in highschool too. She had a boyfriend in the beginning of the book and Charlie saw him hit her. And she didn't do anything. Charlie wasn't allowed to tell his parents but he did end up telling a teacher who called their parents. She has other boyfriends that Charlie sees and talks about.<br /><br />The real end to this story is when Charlie's sister, and Patrick and Sam graduate and go off to college.<br /><br />I loved this book. It's about this weird kid in high school and its very funny. It is also very relatable. Many kids could connect to this, whether its about friendships or romantic relationships or family problems. Almost any problem that a teenager could have is in this book. And Charlie has those problems but he lived through it. This book may however not be appropriate for younger kids. It is not difficult to read, but there are some inappropriate things in the book.<br />The book is set up as letters to an unknown person (the reader) and from Charlie. This is a rather unusual way of writing a story but this book has no plot. Nothing happens. There is no storyline. Charlie is just living his life and explaining it in these letters. There is also no known reason why he writes to this person. The book is easy to follow and fun to read.<br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I think many people would love reading it. It's interesting and it's as if a teen boy actually wrote it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this amazing book in just two days! It was impossible to put down. Suspense and romance at its finest!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I very addicting game. Just make sure you have plenty of memory or the game will not run on your phone.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|.I thought it was supposed to be another social interaction site..People post and do not reply to any retweets..Or comments on the tweets I made. I am not the only one, several people I have interacted with via facebook have felt the same way as me. Its just a celebrity sound off,which lets you be apart of the world but not really..I deleted account..Not interested in feeling like a celebrity stalker.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I read A LOT and am always looking for books like this-- books that have believable, likable characters; that are well written; that have a gripping plot; and that have your mind going in a hundred different directions, wondering how all of the pieces are eventually going to fit together. I have not found it to be predictable which is also a bonus. I also love how Harkness interweaves all sorts of historical events and figures. As a teacher of British literature, the explanation of Christopher Marlowe having been a daemon makes perfect sense!

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I loved reading this book. It is filled with tons of psychology and really makes you take a hard look at the habits you have. I couldn't put this book down and I think you'll probably have the same problem.
B006T3RM08|4.0|I looked at several of these docks and this one looked the best to me. Works well. Everything snaps into place for one seamless look. I will point out that heavy use of clicking the track pad on the bottom corners will cause the track pad to stick. Just needs a little bump to get back in place. Otherwise, it's a great design.<br /><br />Ideal for web surfing or any other cpu uses on the couch too!
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Saw them on YouTube and they are the new up and coming Accapela group.  They will make it as big as Rockapella has.
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Had to watch it 2 times to understand what was going on. After the second watch I liked it much better.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This was a cute movie but not fit for kids.  Language and content not good but still a cute movie for older people.
B005OCFGTO|2.0|I have been researching on Amazon for the whole dvd collection of Harry Potter since beginning of November.<br />The problem with my purchase is that I got an ad in my mail box about the a retail in this collection. I bought it, without paying attention that it was a regular dvd, not a blueray one.<br />Even though the delivery was done properly and in time for Xmas, I got frustrated because I already have the regular dvds and I was really interested in a blue-ray collection.<br />bummer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it! I enjoy the variaty of the games. also I enjoy how you have to earn points to unlock the games.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark Knight Trilogy was a perfect  present for my grandson who is a very avid Batman fan.  He likes all the Batman movies and can't wait until a new feature comes available.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Very creative script.  New concepts present in humorous ways.  The first few minutes are the best part!  Have fun watching it.
B00000J2PH|5.0|We previously bought a Carole King box set 'A Natural Woman: The Ode Collection 1968-1976' with many of the songs from Tapestry.  Still with Tapestry being such an excellent disc through and through there is something about having CD packaging plus liner notes to relive the experience.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Although not a riveting novel, I looked forward to getting back to reading it every time I had to put it down.<br />Written with imagination, and quality. It would make a really good book club read. There were lots of things<br />to discuss and mull over. And it had several surprises.<br />I really enjoyed it.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|She and I are both fans of the Nashville TV show but I can say I am not a country music fan.  My wife is also not a country music fan but she sure likes this disc.<br /><br />No fault of Amazon.com but others previously commented that a song is listed as being included on the disc on the small black sticker on top of the shrinkwrap, when that song is nowhere to be found on the disc.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I like this series it's funny,sometimes scary and it doesn't treat its viewers like idiots.I love Cass.(he's so adorably clueless).
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Truly a romance of a different kind. Refreshing.  Keeps you on edge. Held my attention better than book one. Already purchased book three.
0765325950|5.0|As with all things, The Wheel of Time has come to an end. Having followed the series for years, it was a bittersweet feeling as I closed the back cover and contemplated what it all meant. No spoilers here, but it was an interesting finish. While I don't think it was the best book in the series, it did do a good job of answering some questions, finishing what Robert Jordan started, and brought an end to a series dating back over two decades ago. Great job to Brandon Sanderson and team.<br /><br />While I was as well disappointed in no Ebook release yet, I fail to understand all of the whiny people giving this title a 1 star just because they can't get an Ebook yet. Really is an excellent refection of our society today. Sad but true.
B000SEI230|3.0|I think the movie is better. Much more emotion from the movie than book. The book is okay and an easy read, but it was lacking substance,maybe lacking some emotion too.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I have been playing this game on android for years now....I read a lot of reviews that state that it is rigged. I have a better win record than the game, I admit at times it seems like it gets amazing rolls, especially at the end of the game...and I win more than it does on level 5. If it was truly rigged, it's unlikely that I would be ahead after thousands of games played. Thanks for some competition.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|While this remake was action-packed, I found that it just wasn't as good as the original. Good visual effects though.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use TuneIn to primarily listen to a few of my local NYC radio stations when on the go, out on my balcony, etc.  Love listening to my jazz stations or sports talk radio on my phone.  Extremely simple to use, nice interface, can save your favorite stations to an easy to access list.
B00333NCTM|5.0|It's like he's just there with you telling stories of his life.  Loved the whole book. Great read for any Ozzy fan.
B004I744AS|5.0|This free dictionary app is an excellent resource for persons of all ages. I'm grateful to have this powerful tool and resource and use it often.
B0067QPVJ6|2.0|First I'll say the John Carpenter one was very enjoyable. You could feel the tension and distrust between everyone. This one felt forced. The tension was never really believable from anyone aside from Ms. Winsted. She made it better though the only tension was when the Thing was hunting people. Everyone else seemed to be going through the motions. Second, I wasn't sure if I was watching the JC version or a prequel. I thought it was supposed to be a prequel, but it felt like I was watching John's version. Everything seemed lifted: from the test to the wandering in the storm. They did try and alter the test but it all felt too familiar.<br /><br />I will say I loved the tie in at the end. That partially made the movie for me. Fit very nicely into John's version. Aside from that, this was a pretty mundane creature feature that would have been better served with another name.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I will now take more time to look at the stars !!!!!!Beautiful story! Totally in love with Holder !!!! :)
B001AQR3MQ|5.0|I'm a cuba gooding jr fan and this is one of my favorite movies and wanted to add it to my movie collection of movies.

B007HACDLK|4.0|As usual for Flynn, a spell-binding read. I love the way he always keeps you guessing. Mitch Rapp is such a heroic main character.
0786962984|5.0|oh the childhood memories! Small Small children should not play this game for all the little pieces but with a few slight tweaks to the rules our 5 year old can play this right next to his 60 something Grandmother.  It a fun fun game that is easy to explain to a beginner.<br />Great for a night off from the regular D&D or as an introduction to roleplaying.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I only gave it 2 stars because the storyline became so &#34;far-fetched&#34; about midway through the book. Also I found the characters a little difficult to relate to.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the BEST GAME EVER!!!! I play it all the time and it is so addictive I totally recommend this game to everyone! it is fast paced and also pretty interesting! GET THIS GAME!!!!
B000FA5STS|3.0|Not Baldacci's best - just an average thriller. Usually This author defines his characters and events better than what I found in this book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Title  'The Racketeer'<br />Is not light reading. It takes the reader through a plot that is not expected.Makes you want the crooks to win.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|I recently got a 3D TV and wanted to find some good movies to enjoy the 3D features. This movie has a great story and the 3D effects are amazing! I wasn't much of a big 3D fan at first but seeing these movies at home, they're starting to grow on me. Plus it's nice to have at least three formats when buying Blu-Rays now, for the price I feel like I get my money's worth.<br /><br /> So far, this movie and Finding Nemo are definitely movies to check out for the 3D. Avatar is in the mail and can't wait to see it again since the theatrical release in 3D.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Every time one problem is solved another pops up.  Good explanations and fascinating details that really make you want to keep reading.  A books you don't want to put down.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesome! I'm a really a big fan of the series so of course I loved it! Great for just 6 bucks
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|Pokes fun at itself, while still delivering the action, the stars, and the chortles. This and a frozen pizza, you got yourself a cheap dinner and movie night.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|Very intriguing form the very beginning till the end, written with a brilliant  suspense., absolutely involving.I highly , truly recommend it.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I like the big name people in it.  It had a good story, and as years go by I become more and more of a fan of Bruce Willis.  Helen Mirren is great, as is Morgan Freeman.  It's a bit of a fun movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like the size of the key's, and find it easy to use. After trying numerous calculator apps this is my favorite by far.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Easy to setup and control. Good options and good music to wake to. Nice selection of options and good for on the go.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It reminds me of how much I liked the style of Pulp Fiction.  How multiple story lines converge and fill in the blanks.<br />Hugh writes his characters with a big pen, giving the reader much more to invest in.<br />I have read the next two installments, &#34;First Shift&#34;, and &#34;Second Shift&#34;, and I will be reading any more Hugh puts out as well.
1423113454|5.0|summer reading choice order process was  uneventful  book arrived on time and in good shape<br />not much more I can add
B00005JMAH|5.0|It was a great buy at the time.  We needed this disc for our collection and it was exactly what you would expect with a DVD purchase.
B004R1Q296|5.0|Wonderful descripton of a long gone era, but important for undestanding of human development.  Very well written, Tuchman hold readers with excellent story writng skills.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|I enjoyed the film. It makes you watch out of curiosity, because the plot and the subject matter are both novel. Novelty is by no means synonymous with merit. This film is poetic in its dialogue and it's production value (the score, imagery, etc...) What's most striking is its irregular timing, and also its lack of several normal features: a clear trajectory, antagonists, climax, a clear ending. Watch it.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Service wonderful, came right on time. great for the family entertainment everyone enjoyed it and it made Christmas a perfect holiday
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Really enjoyed Looper! Great acting and creative story line. Plus I recommend anything with Joseph Gordon Levitt. The quality was great on amazon streaming as well.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It was a used DVD and I wasn't sure if it was smart to get it but it was. It was like new when I got it and I love it.

B009439E7O|5.0|Been waiting for a new release and here it is. Everything I would expect from them, they still have it. Great album!!!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a story that needed to be told. It gives the average reader insight into the incredible commitment, bravery and sacrifice of our military, and that of their families.  It is a story that has stayed with me, and I want it to.  They deserve our thoughts and prayers!
0756697875|4.0|Good visuals, surrounded by interesting details on the history, what changed etc. My 7 yr old loves it and it's made a fantastic xmas present
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is brought to its conclusion is this really great book.  It does not sugar coat the idea that great things have a great price.
B004SKLD9A|5.0|This film looks even better on blu-ray. It is a must see for and science fiction fan. Glad to have it in my collection
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't put down the Hunger Games Trilogy.  It is great reading, but might be a little too much for children.  Definitely for &#34;young adults&#34; and up.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Downloaded for my son and he loves it - plays it often on his Kindle when he has the time.
0307887448|4.0|I found the main storyline of the book to be just riveting. The pop culture references were fun, the story was entertaining and interesting, and the villains were nice and evil.<br /><br />I had two main problems with the novel. First, the writing style was not my favorite, especially in the beginning. It can sometimes feel like the author is just telling you everything, on and on, without showing you any action. The sections with backstory were often very inelegant for this reason, and slowed the story's forward momentum way down.<br /><br />Second, the female characters (at least the ones represented as such - I don't want to spoil anything) in this book were very undeveloped. Cline clutched on to the manic pixie dream girl trope for dear life, and never let them become more interesting. Females are already not well-represented in science fiction and in the gaming world in general. The females we hear the most about are Art3mis and Kira. Both are the cute nerd girl types, and both are idolized by the more important male characters in the story. Kira is never actually in the story but is more like a muse that drives the two men whose teamwork created OASIS. Art3mis is one of the main characters, and the love interest of Wade. He had a crush on her before he ever met her because he read her blog. She tells him many times throughout the story that he doesn't even know the real her, and can't actually be in love with her for that reason. Seems like a good point, right? Lucky for her, the smarter men are around to put her silly female thoughts to rest. Wade insists that he does know her and that she is exactly who he knew she was ever since he read her blog posts, and Cline apparently has no problem with this. She was exactly the way she portrayed herself in her blog, and we never had to learn that she wasn't the totally awesome girl of Wade's loser dreams. For any nerd girls who reject the stereotypes, this will probably bother you as much as it bothered me.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Van Morrison's soulful songs are classic R&B music. He sings with his heart and touches the heart of the listener.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|God bless Marcus..his fallen comrades..and the U.S. Navy Seals...all over the world...your in my thoughts and prayers..keep fighting...U.S.A. #1..great book.
B004FQX5CK|4.0|This was a gift to a friend who liked it very much. The action was great and the images were clearer and more intense.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game had a twisted and surprising love and investigative story line.  graphics were great.  some of the games were very challenging.
0525478817|5.0|Incredible! Why are books you love so hard to review? I can't believe this book was not actually written by Hazel Grace! How can a 30 something year old man have captured the voices of 17 year old adolescents so faultlessly. It is almost impossible not to fall in love with Hazel and Gus and wish you were 17 all over again falling in love for the first time but being grateful and aware of just how lucky we were. I wholeheartedly recommend you read this book. It will stay with me for a very long time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Game is great for passing the time quickly while you wait for appointments, meetings, etc.  Coins are kinda slow to regenerate, but game developer is probably counting on our impatience so that we will buy more coins.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I seriously cannot say enough good things about this app!! It's wonderful especially for free and I have not slept in once since downloading this alarm clock.
B005LAII80|4.0|Much in the same blood splatter appeal as the visually spectacular, \\"Punisher War Zone,\\" the 2012 version of the \\"Dread\\" reboot masterfully pulls the character from the pages of the comic book to the big screen and soaks that with buckets of dripping grit and grime. With that wash, expect \\"Dredd\\" to be one of those cult classics, a film that did poorly at the box office, but gets a second life as a repeat playback worthy of multiple views.<br /><br />And views it provides - everything about the film fits within the stylishly lavish CGI world, though with a minuscule budget in relation to other adaptions, director Pete Travis stretches the American dollar, body count for body count. The story line itself, penned by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra, is really a simplistic and straightforward plot approach that rewards audiences with a more by the books Dredd, who lead Keith Urban plays with hardened appeal. Olivia Thirlby helms Anderson in her own poker faced way, giving substance to Dredd's special abilities sidekick partner. And of course, there's Ma Ma, who Lena Headey does so with quiet, but violent tendencies.<br /><br />A bit of warning: those who come in with a blind buy mentality might find themselves in the cross hairs of a flick with certain and particular, say 'comic book' expectations. Unfortunately, those expectations will definitely be shot down by the disappointment they'll feel of a film considered by them to be complete chaos. Sure, it feels a little longer than it should. However, others will know this is the version of Dredd they've been waiting for, a film pure of unadulterated action bliss, a shoot-em up that will appeal to both fans of the comic and those who enjoy it for it is: a slow burn of a satisfying thrill ride.
B008MEM24S|3.0|an error when i was attempting to purchase doofenshmitz. please correct this error so I can continue to play. thanks.
B001G70M6S|5.0|I use this with my Land 101<br /><br />I love this, it's a great and fun way to do photography. I ordered a couple and used it last holiday season for Christmas parties and Events. The best part is the ISO 3000, so no need to bring the flash with me.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Love it! As the mother of five, anything that simplifies, is a must have! With everyone on their own devices...we all stay connected!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book, but I liked the 1st book better. Catching Fire kept my interest, and I can't wait to read Mockingjay to find out what happened to Peers.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|very entertaining....would watch over and over<br />special effects are excellent.....go ahead buy it....you wont be sorry....<br />Logan<br />age 11<br />:)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent!  Easy read, fast read, keeps you wanting more.  I cannot wait to start book 3 of the series.  You won't be disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book surprised me by keeping me guessing as to what the out come could be for the games and the two  from district 12  the last couple of chapters surprised me well worth reading
B003O86FMW|5.0|As the first one was...poetic. Peeta breaks my heart. How Katniss can even consider Gale is beyond me. You don't know what you got till it's gone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent setting, character development and plot. This book touches on a plethora of themes relevant to young and old alike. Great story!
B000I9S64U|5.0|i was so happy to find this movie in the cloud. i got it because it was not on netflix.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Odessa, c'est le meilleur album des Bee Gees première période. Tous les critiques s'accordent là dessus. Mais pendant la promo de l'album, Barry et Robin se disputent sur le premier titre à sortir en 45T, et Robin claque la porte. Le disque n'aura jamais la carrière qu'il méritait. Raison de plus pour sauter sur ce coffret, d'autant que quand les frères Gibb font une réédition d'un ancien vinyle en CD, ils ne font pas les choses à moitié. On reçoit les chansons du double album original en deux versions (mono et stéréo) plus des titres inédits qui n'ont pas été retenus à l'époque, et des versions alternatives. Un livret explicatif, le poster qui était offert à l'époque dans le double 33t, un autocollant (!), le tout dans un coffret en velours rouge. C'est Noël!
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|Literally finished the same day I purchased it. Giffin does an excellent job of wrapping up the events that took place in 'Something Borrowed.' Works very well as stand alone story, even if one had never read Something Borrowed. Quick and easy read. Nice to be in Darcy's head for a change.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|A great way to keep up with family and friends when at home or on the go!<br /><br />Easy to set up and it updates itself.....<br /><br />A great way to share photos with family and friends....
B005V5WBFG|3.0|A good product to protect your Kindle, with the exception of a glitch. It shows it needs to set up 2 services but there is no way to set them up.  :/<br /><br />Otherwise, it does what it says it will do. And that is, protect your Kindle when you surf the `net....
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Typical Angry Birds. A GREAT time waster. Great for keeping the kids busy ( or maybe the adults? ) on trips or during wait times.<br /><br />Good graphics and sound.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|A great app to have, very easy to use and it does everything I want, and then some.<br /><br />A must have......
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Loved it! The thought of your favorite toy coming to life is amazing! So much funnier than I imagined! This is a must see!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I received it on time, and it was in great condition. As always Rod Stewart sounded fantastic and made Christmas come alive with his great voice and beat.
076781326X|4.0|Good movie; the film came as advertised and I'm glad I got it.  Somebody was rehearsing for a role in the Oliver play and watched this movie to help the role.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|the game is fun and sometimes challenging. interesting story line with twists. I can't wait to see how this ends.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|While it's not the complexity of the original, it's still pork pecking action and lots of fun. I have not had any problems with running the game and my kids love it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The birds are back in this free version of the original that is keeping my kids happy and satisfied with the pecking action.  We haven't had any problems with running the game and while it doesn't have all the levels of the real game, it's still addictive fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love how a good book makes you want to keep reading. I read til my eyes started crossing. I had to finish the moment I began.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A must for everyone!<br />It was so inspirational and every one loves a great story about a kid with probes lol
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book by far!! The third wheel has just the right mix of reality and humor, i definetly recommend this book for readers from a age 9=12
B008JGSM6G|5.0|ummmmmmm. I don't know what to say about this app only that..... well its just fun and addicted. ive only just downloaded it today and I cant stop playing it. awesome game
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice app, easy to use and just practical. Why try to fix whst's not broke, the most important thing here is &quot;it's free&quot;.
030758836X|4.0|The book has been so comprehensively covered in other reviews, there is not much I can add.  It was the first book I have read in a long time that kept me up late two nights running, that I found almost impossible to put down.  It was refreshing to have that \\"I gotta know what happens next!\\" feeling -- the suspense and plot twists were dazzling.  I'm giving it four stars instead of five because, like many other reviewers, I felt let down by the way it ended. Despite that, I am recommending it to friends because it is such a great read almost all the way through.
B005LAII80|5.0|You get an HD iTunes DC with this purchase or you can choose UV.  This is how it should be done.  Bravo for making this happen.  Do it like this from now on an you will sell more bluray disc.  I promise you.  Thanks.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is very moving.  I think that the topic is something that is not talked about too much and I find myself wanting to share it to start conversations about fatherhood.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent read, characters are well-developed and plot holds together. A memorable and heart moving story. I'll be looking for more from Colleen Hoover.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had heard about this book through a women's book club, but hesitated reading it due to comments others had made.  However, I decided after seeing more and more reviews of the book to read it for myself.  At the time I was not aware it was a trilogy, so now I have the other two books in the series.  I have read this first installment and yes, it is everything everyone said it was.  It is very explicit, so if you do not like to read about truly intimate moments and some hardcore sexual activities, then this book is not for you.  If you can get past some of the sexual parts, it actually has a pretty good plot and I didn't have any problem turning page after page to find out what happens.  I like the sassy personality of the main character but wish she had a little more backbone.  Again, if you are into explicit descriptions of sexual acts or can get past them to actually get into the characters and the plot, this book is a great read.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|bought this for a friend,we are not backpackers by any means,but we do look for new ways of surviving the coming bad times,and this is just another option for cooking whereever we may be...
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I have not watched American Idol since the season Sanjaya appeared on the show, and since that season American Idol has become a joke. HOWEVER, there have been some talented performers pass through that venue. Of ALL of the winners from American Idol, Phillip Phillips is the REAL DEAL! This album is EXCELLENT! There are only two songs on the entire CD that I do not particularly like, but other than those two songs, I LOVE this album! Phillip's voice is more than unique, and his guitar-playing talent is amazing. This is a great first album for him, and I would defiinitely recommend it to others. I will take Phillip Phillips over John Mayer ANY DAY!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Some movies you just know you are going to like. This was one that I knew I wanted to see seconds into the trailer. We rented it when it came out and knew immediately that it was one we wanted to own. You really feel for the characters, both good and bad. Looking forward to seeing the next one.
B005LAII08|5.0|Good story and understandable.  Good lessons taught.  The 3D technology was great. Good deal for the price.  Love it.  Try for yourself
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed the book and look forward to the next one. Easy reading and kept my attention. Thanks for a great read.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Love this movie and the 3D technology was great.  Of course small children would not wear the 3d glasses but this deal has regular disk too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game on my Kindle Fire. I dont have any issues. It took me a while to understand the concept of the game but I got it figured out. At first it was kind of slow and waiting on my coins to build up was a drag but now I have over twelve thousand coins. I cant even use them before another thousand is added. Totally recommend this app. Have patience. Trick is to gain as many prizes as you can.
B00447G29S|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out but not in 3D.  Wow was it neat to see in 3D
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Excellent book! It is definitely better than the movie adaptation! Full of twists, turns, and brings a new level of understanding to Teddy Daniels.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I rated this book 5 stars because it keeps you very interested, fast pasted. Would not recommed for anyone under the age of 18!
B0072OFM28|5.0|I have followed this version of spartacus since the first season, through the prequel, etc. I was worried that I would not enjoy this season due to the death of the original actor who played Spartacus. However, I got into this season and was able to accept the new actor in the role. Like the previous seasons, this one is extremely violent and shocking but also very exciting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this type of book whenever i can, and this is a great addition to the 'life after death' library.  Dr. Alexander's experience is readable and believable.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen continues to make me laugh.  That is why I love this book.  It makes you think a little and laugh a lot.  I think she is witty.  I would recommend this book to anyone who could use some humor in their lives.
B00846REIS|5.0|Introduction to Gideon & Eva's love story. You see how they are and why they react to eachother.<br />Reading second book for sure.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I absolutely loved this episode! I love the series!! I like how the episode went back to make sure I got everything before going into the next season. I am a little behind, but I will catch up.(:
0765325950|5.0|This was a good ending to the series. It wasn't a perfect ending but after thirteen books it would be hard to write a perfect ending. I agree with others who have said that some minor characters had more time than a few major characters. Also, I noticed Sanderson's writing style a bit more at times. But overall it was a satisfying ending. It was fun to see connections to small details that were mentioned as early as The Eye of the World.
B0067R0APK|4.0|If you're not a weather info fanatic, and I'm not, this is all you need to know how to dress and to plan ahead, all in an easy to read/use format (Kindle Fire).
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I just saw Zero Dark 30 and was interested in reading a more detailed story behind the mission - this book delivered on that and a whole lot more into what it takes to be part of the best of the best SEALS.  Great read.
B0076DELIG|3.0|It was definitely not the Harry Bosch that I was expecting. It is repetitive & dull at times. I was very disappointed.
B008CPRLP2|5.0|Installed on my new Kindle HD 8.9&#34; and works as expected. Clicking on zip in email unzipped to the winzip directory. pretty simple!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the mystery of this book.  I was never sure in most parts what would happen.  The couple is a roller coaster.
B000SEH1R8|4.0|This hilarious and frightening book can still inspire writers to take chances and write satire that hits deep. I cannot say if  it always works because it is both very accessible and far out science fiction. But Vonnegut is courageous and right on.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Some folks out there are saying that the latest books in this series are losing their magic...not so. I admit that Feast of Crows was a little slow at times, but this makes up for it and we see a lot more of our favorite, the dragon queen and the Imp.<br />You will not be disappointed!
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Although I am only part of the way through this book, I find myself telling others about what I have read already.  This book helps me understand many of my actions and gives me ideas of how to address them.  As the saying goes, knowing that you are doing it is half the battle.  I really look forward to getting throught the rest of it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It's trying to hard to be a really good book, which it is not.  It took me about half-way through before I started to even get into it.<br />I suggested it for our book club, now I wish I hadn't.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Product was packaged for protection along with fast shipping. Very pleased with this transaction and would recommend this product and seller.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Perfect movie for any collection, with this all star cast how could you go wrong. We have actors from How I Met Your Mother (Cobie - Agent Maria Hill) , Hurt Locker (Jeremy - Hawk Eye), Shutter Island (Mark - Hulk), Puncture (Chris E - Capt. America), The Soloist (Robert - IronMan), The Cabin In The Woods (Chris H - Thor), The Island (Scarlett -Black Widow). Joss Whedon is the director, man behind shows like FireFly and Buffy The Vampire Slayer, He knows the Good, the Bad, and the Strange. Why wouldn't you buy this super amazing, super fantastic, super galatic, roller coaster of a movie. Don't be cheap just BUY IT!!!
0375851569|5.0|This is a great little collection of beginner books. If you have a new baby to buy a gift for you cannot beat the gift of books.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family.  We all laughed so hard our stomachs hurt.  The humor is not only geared towards children, but also adults as well.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the funnest brain games. starts off very easy but gets challenging, so anyone can play it
B005LAII1C|2.0|It looks as though this is a burnt copy. I bought it as a gift and it looked as if it is bootleg!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I bought a couple of these handy little sharpeners, one for my son and myself.  They're light weight and provides you a quick way to resharpen your blades.  This is especially important when field dressing a deer or other large game because using a dull blade(s) is not only substantially more work but more importantly it makes it very dangerous.  The last thing you want is a nasty cut while miles away from a medical center.  Just make sure you clean the blade(s) before making a pass through the V slots or you'll gum them up.<br /><br />The diamond rod is good on serrated blades but I wish the diamond grit on the rod was just a bit finer.<br /><br />Overall this is a very lightweight and compact sharpener and a must for every outdoorsman.  It's easy to store in your backpack or even in your pocket during your next hunting, fishing or back packing excursion.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Love this author. She definately knows how to write for an historical period, but keep it &#34;modern&#34; and interesting for the present day.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great series on the underdog fighter who shows how life is what you make of it and somethings are not just for the glory. The last movie Rocky Balboa is a must see if you have not seen it. Shows how life can deliver punches but as long as you keep pushing forward anyone with the desire can take em and get back up.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Really recommend ANYTHING by Kate Morton. She know how to weave a plot and flesh out her characters and plot lines.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|I'm reading a lot of the 1 star reviews and people seem to be complaining about how this album goes in a much softer, more mainstream direction than their previous albums, and I even read a review that says this album is like a downward continuation of their last album, recommending that people should listen to ITM's first two albums if they want to hear ITM when they were \\"good.\\"<br /><br />Which doesn't make sense.  Their last album, their third album, was harder than their second album IMO.  Blood feels A LOT like the band's second album The Dream.  The biggest difference between the two albums, for me, is that the lyrics throughout Blood feel a lot more amateurish than those present in The Dream.  Other than that, they share a very similar amount of softer songs and harder songs and clean vocals over scream vocals.  The Dream was a great album too, and I still actually like it more than this newest release, but the negative reviews from listeners praising old over new don't know what they're talking about.  Blood is not the first ITM album to have this kind of sound.  This isn't a complete \\"new direction\\" that they've taken like these negative reviews would lead you to believe.  I love all of their albums, old and new.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Knew from reviews that she was departing from anything remotely close to previous serious. But she should have stuck to that genre. There was not one character that you could cheer for or hope something good would happen to.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game and somewhat addictive!  Both of my daughters (5 and 18) enjoy playing it.  My husband and I have enjoyed it too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book! Never a dull moment. I couldn't put it down. A little bit of the book was predictable but that given, it still kept my attention and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Grisham never disappoints. He is a master storyteller with just the right amount of disrespect for the legal profession and some of the unsavory characters in it.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|this is a wonderful version of the Christmas Carol for kids of all ages and the music is great, watch it every Christmas
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This was in a list shared among friends as a video they always watched at Christmas. I had never heard of it but thought it the perfect baby holiday gift since it is mostly visual. I opened the package and watched it for myself before wrapping and was entranced. Beautifully illustrated with lovely music. I plan to order one to keep for myself.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked it but it did leave a few details out that made me wonder what happened. Overall liked it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't want to go to sleep while reading this book. Finished reading it in one day! i totally recommend this
B0098VXMNE|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the series since it's inception, It took a few episodes to adjust to the missed andy whitfield but the writers and actors are awesone
B0074EIQUG|5.0|If you like blues, roots, New Orleans with a little rock tossed with some great harmony and licks, this is your disk.  Yummy like that!  Love it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|On Christmas it was awesome to see the look on my mom's face. Thanks for helping make it awesome for her!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I never really thought about time until I read The Time Keeper.  I loved it from the first page to the last.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I have come to love these little mystery-hunt/puzzle games, and this one was really a fun and delightfully creepy addition to that set.  The story is okay--not great-- but the atmospherics make up for that.  A very fun game.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Daughter loved the book, it's a classic and what more is there to say? Except that the review require me to write more. SO there.
B00177YEFM|4.0|Sent this to my adult son as a fun stocking stuffer and he liked it! Uses as a joke lamp!
B002R88G5E|5.0|An amazing story of 2 women , so well told its difficult to believe it was written by a man! He gives us true insight into the plight of women in Afganistan .
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love my shell that I bought for my kindle fire, it works great and I feel it fits the products well.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Well written book ,likeable characters, a mystery that kept you guessing right to the end . A thoroughly enjoyable read , couldnt put it down and was disappointed it had to come to an end
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Eben Alexander does a wonderful job of letting us know what is beyond and how (beyond) incredible it is and at the same time how to create that same love here in our physical bodies back on earth. My family experienced 2 tragic deaths withing the last 1 1/2 years and this was so helpful for me.<br />Thanks for sharing your experience with the world.
0345803493|5.0|This book has me stuck to its pages, I can't put it down. Don't read late at night because u will get no sleep.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I seen all the television shows before reading the comics, so I had to read it to see how GOOD it was....and it was AMAZING.<br /><br />There are some similarities to the show..but overall..it is very different, better dialogue, and also much darker. Kirkman did an amazing job at building characters and really allowing you to \\"know\\" them as a person..and not as a work of \\"fiction\\". I am currently on the second volume and am loving that one also! It looks great on the Kindle Fire also.......LOVE IT!
0345803507|5.0|I was so upset that this was the last book of the series. It did seem kind of rushed to the end, but I still enjoyed the book just the same.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Handy and versatile.  Highly recommend tor your Fire.  This product makes the Kindle easy to use, easy to carry, and it protects it.  Expect to pay almost double in the big stores.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|The music took me further into the book, allowed me to feel as if I was there living the story from beginning ot end.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|It was a disappointing read for me.  I got the same details from a Katie Curic Show I saw on TV.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|The iItem came in good condition on the promised date.  I Popped some popcorn, sat back, and enjoyed the movie.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This is a great movie and book.  Every couple should watch the movie together.  The movie covers some really deep subjects and how important it is to truly be present and involved with your family.  Loved it....both the movie and book!
1578988411|5.0|Loved this book! it helped me so much! I hope this book will remain in print for future generations. So helpful! Great ideas!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The story was engrossing and the final plot twist was the capper.  Lawyers can be dangerous even after they have been disbarred.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|It just plain works. Does what it needs to do. Doesn't do the unnecessary. We need more apps like this.
0385535147|3.0|This was not a standard book. It had small pages and very small print. This information should have been disclosed to me before the transaction occurred.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|The reality and lives of the people of North Korea is beyond what anyone else can imagine. This book provides a collection of real life stories of how it is to actually live in a country where the whole population is brain washed, abused and manipulated in a manner which eerily resembles Orwell's \\"1984\\". The author writes beautifully about how people cope in such a reality, and what happens to them when/if they manage to escape. This book is definitely to be recommended as it gives a rare glimpse into a country which is closed and ignored by most.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Anyone who has ever worked or dreamed of working in an office atmosphere can sit back and enjoy the comedy and humor in this unforgettable movie. Once you see it, it only gets better each time you watch.  It's a classic! Our family wanted it in blu-ray format.
B001706I5I|5.0|One of our favorite family time Christmas movies! Family tradition watching this with the children. If the kids had their way they would watch everyday!
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Not worth the money.  Had some nice special effects but not worth the money.  I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I love the emotional read and Christian of cause. I would recommend this read to everyone. Really
B00AAGAVXK|5.0|This is one of most inspirational and lovable book about style and life I ever read . Since  I finished it  I am looking for something like that to keep the feeling of fulfillment and joy.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|When this movie was released in 3D at the theater, I was in awe with the  phenomenal visuals and 3D effects. The story is great as anyone who's ever seen it will say, but the scenery is what takes this film to the limits. Watching it again in 3D at home brought back those same oohs and ahhhs. This movie should be in anyone's top 3D list for sure.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was not a light read, it deals with very emotional issues. However, It is a very moving story filled with hope. Phenomenal book!! Awesome book!! It will pull your heart strings.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie will make you cry.  It is awesome and the acting and directing is beautifully orchestrated.  You get a real understanding of what it was like for homosexuals in the 1960s.
B00004CX8H|1.0|i didn't know what &#34;regions&#34; were all about...it's the wrong region and doesn't work...ALSO....it's the second Michael Collins&#34; i've bought from you because the first one cuts out every time with 20 minutes to go in the movie....it's not the machine....i've informed you of this twice and have gotten no response.....d.lewis
B007HO392S|5.0|This CD is awesome. It's completely different. Some people are giving mixed reviews but I think it's all around pretty awesome.<br /><br />Song by Song Review<br /><br />1) Good Girl - The First Single of the album. This is classic Carrie. Fun, loud, pop country. This song is great. 5/5<br /><br />2) Blown Away - This is my favorite song on the album. It's got pretty dark subject matter but its really well put together. This song tells a story. This song will definitely get stuck in your head. 5/5<br /><br />3) Two Black Cadillacs - If Blown Away was dark, this song is pitch black. Another story telling song. I'm not so crazy about the song itself in terms of the way its sang. By that I mean the melody, she does a good job with it. The lyrics really make it enjoyable to listen to. 4.5/5<br /><br />4) See You Again - This song is pretty much complete pop. It's pretty different. Nothing seems special about this one. Its got a bit of an odd pace. I like the part where she slows it down and sings it in a higher slower pace. For the most part it seems really strange. 3/5<br /><br />5) Do You Think About Me - I really love this song. She sings it beautifully and it is really enjoyable to listen to. This is the Ohh III Ohhh II song. You really get a sense of how talented she is on this song. 5/5<br /><br />6) Forever Changed - This is one of those songs that's not gonna be your jams or anything but its a cool song. If you're a fast paced song fanatic you might have a hard time sitting through it. It's nice to listen to. It took a few listens for me to get the whole story. Very nicely sang. 4/5<br /><br />7) Nobody Ever Told You - This is one of those girl power songs. It's got a nice message to it. It's nice in a society where girls are rough on themselves based on their image. 5/5<br /><br />8) One Way Ticket - Reggae Pop Country. This is different. Very different. Some people don't like it. I think its interesting and its catchy. I haven't heard anything like it before.So points for being creative. 5/5<br /><br />9) Thank God For Hometowns - This is one of those songs that the artist puts on the CD that is not that great. It probably means a lot to her especially considering her rise to fame, but it really doesn't do much for me. 3/5<br /><br />10) Good in Goodbye - Nice song about moving on after a relationship ends and looking towards the positives in a hard time. Cool song. 4/5<br /><br />11) Leave Love Alone -  Great song! This song talks about how great love can be and why sometimes ya just can't leave it alone. Catchy song with a nice guitar going on in the back. 5/5<br /><br />12) Cupids Got A Shotgun - Awesome Awesome Awesome. This song is lyrically hilarious. Cupid with a shotgun. She put Brad Paisley on the guitar so that made this song pretty sweet. Catchy, hilarious what more could you ask for 5/5<br /><br />13) Wine After Whiskey -  I like the title and the concept of sometimes things after great things other things aren't as good. They don't seem as strong. However I think the lyrics/style could have been done better. 3.5/5<br /><br />14) Who Are You -  This song is ok. It's a song that's supposed to be multi-faceted and she made it with the intention that everyone is supposed to get something different out of it. To me I think its a love song looking for your spouse. But its up to your own interpretation. 4/5<br /><br />5+5+4.5+3+5+4+5+5+3+4+5+5+3.5+4 = 61<br />14*5 = 70<br /><br />61/70 = 87.14%
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I first got the free app and loved it so much I purchased the premium one. its mixing and wave sections help me sleep better longer and have great dreams. so buy this app you will be pleased
1416550518|5.0|Morton's tale is woven like a richly-colored tapestry--the full image isn't apparent at first but develops over time, going back and forth from an elderly woman in the present to the 1920s Downtown Abbey world she inhabited &#34;downstairs&#34;.  Morton does not write in a linear style, but drops hints as she goes along till the full story is revealed at last.  The end moves back and forth quickly, like the staccato breaths of the dying woman.  Don't be fooled by the mystery seemingly unveiled in the opening pages of the book.  This gifted writer has surprises in store!  I also loved her book, &#34;The Secret Keeper,&#34; another mysterious gem.  Morton is amazing at leaving her readers in an &#34;omigosh&#34; state of awe at the end of her books.
0765325950|5.0|Writing a review of Memory of Light without writing a critique of the entire WoT series is nigh impossible, so I'm not even going to try. Suffice to say, the best and worst of both Sanderson and Jordan are on display. And while AMOL has a few almost debilitating scenes as well as some truly exquisite moments, it bests the biggest obstacle in its way: ending a series that has been going for over two decades and survived it's own creator with aplomb.<br /><br />None of this means that I believe A Memory of Light is a fantastic book, or that the Wheel of Time represents the pinnacle of high fantasy (neither are true); much like the series itself, much of AMOL is repetitive and certain chapters can be chores to read, even though they could be well written (how long can a reader follow characters that are exhausted from war without becoming exhausted themselves?). And where the series is fractured and tangential, AMOL is highly focused and driven, almost to a fault. But the Wheel of Time has always been a fatally flawed series that relied on the occasional iconic scene to lift the rest of an otherwise dull book focused around two dimensional characters, and AMOL isn't much different. Sanderson never rises to the heights that Jordan was capable of, but he has made Jordan's characters far more readable, though Sanderson still allots too much time hand-waving away irrelevant story-lines that were left to fester through 11 previous books by Jordan without any real gratification. But none of that matters. Not really.<br /><br />The Wheel of Time is the raison d'etre of modern high fantasy and reading it is like looking through the dissolved history of the genre. It's a throwback to classic tales like the Belgariad and Dragonriders of Pern, while also serving as the foundation for the modern epics like Malazan and the more light-hearted tales like the Gentlemen Bastards. A Memory of Light is an immensely satisfying-if-flawed ending to the series, so it's hard to give it anything but 5 stars.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Our son loved it. It took 3 or 4 days to finish it. Looks great. We recommend for LEGO lovers. Almost 3000 pieces!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Sometimes felt like reading a history book. So many characters and details that I just wanted to get on with it and find out what was going to happen.  Actually it felt like reading a scream play. I am going weary. I want an ending to be in sight even though I have enjoyed the story.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This was a really fun movie. Wonderful singing. I love acapella & this delivered on that. The plot and story are obviously going to be somewhat predicable, but the characters were funny & the actors kept me amused. All in all, I'm glad I took the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it needs a little more work so you can play for a long time and it is so fun I cannot stop playing
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I have used it for 2 days.  Plenty of adds that get in the way but it is free.  Might be better to buy it.
B001VIMCW4|2.0|This Bond just misses the mark.  It is very dark and depressing and it takes more than 3/4 of the movie before you understand the plot.  Poorly written, and it lacks the usual flare associated with Bond movies.
0812992792|4.0|The only reason this difficult novel doesn't get a 5 is that it's so hard to read--it takes place in North Korea, a place of brutality and sadism. I had to put it down for days at a time, but did get through it because the writing is fantastic.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Shipped in a timely fashion.  Packaging good.  The disc was perfect and shows well.  Good value for the money paid
B00867GHS8|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!<br />AWESOME, Great, Funny, Fantastic<br />My 4 year old has already watched it over 20 times<br />Got it fast it was new in the box
B00005KAQP|5.0|What's not to love about Sister Act.  Came quickly and packaged well.  DVD was like you would get in a store. We thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|There are none better and i have owned a lot of them. Sound is perfect completely noise cancelling even though ghey sre not \\"noise cancelling\\"
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Most addictive game on our planet.  Everyone should play it. Try it soon and we'll talk to you next month.
B00646UU5Y|3.0|Maybe this was a bit scary for my 8-year-old to watch but she watched it anyway.  She loves anything and everything dinosaurs!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|This Olympus Flash Memory Card does as well as the one that came with the camera originally. I'll keep using it.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|I was quite impressed as I watched each of the YouTube episodes come out, finding the \\"world\\" well represented, and the characters likeable. I felt I had  avested interest in them by the end. I am no Halo fanboy, but I love me some good sci-fi, and this is great stuff.<br /><br />Now someone make a proper feature-length movie!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|present for the wife. she had never heard of it, and kinda made a face when she opened it. However, once she started watching it, we had to watch the whole first season. she liked it so much that she wouldn't wait for me to watch the 2nd season. very good series. received dvd pretty quick. a great purchase.
B009JBZH54|1.0|When I received these, they looked like burned copies! Beware! I send them back, and went to Best Buy and bought the same exact thing for $10.00 less and they were authentic. There is a noticable difference in packaging and labeling.
B005YPJ31I|5.0|Who is better at political biography than Doris Goodwin? Perhaps no writer. I have not read this book. I bought it for Xmas for my husband, professor emeritus in Political Science. He was glued to this book for days, even staying up nights to continue reading it. He was absolutely enchanted and well-informed.<br /><br />I understand the movie, Lincoln, was taken from this book. In the book, the incident involving the movie gets very little space and was greatly expanded in the movie. I decided when I heard a review of the movie, and saw Goodwin on MSNBC, that hubby should have the whole book. Until the movie was discussed as having come from this book, I didn't even know it was on the market.<br /><br />I probably won't read it since I'm not the political nut my husband is. However, it is enough for me that my husband was totally engrossed, and that I have read a couple of Goodwin's books, notably, the one on FDR. Goodwin's research is impeccable and she has a talent for combining the personal with the public political and not glossing over incidents.<br /><br />For anyone with a strong, political interest, this book is essential: exceptionally well-written and highly fascinating.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was even better than the hunger games!!! A little slow at first but after that it was really good!!! Couldn't put it down!! Can't wait to read the third!!!
B008JEJPSC|3.0|This is a review of the new Blu-Ray Sing-a-long edition.  I have never bought this film before in any format because until now, it was never offered in widescreen.  The new edition looks and sounds great.  I love and dislike this film all at one time, if that makes any sense.  There are moments that it is glorious and moments when I wonder what was going on in the director's mind.  But, with that said.....the good far out-weighs the bad in this film....the cast is marvelous and so is the music.  I have long been a fan of the stage show....so my one big complaint about the film is the changing of the ending from Christmas to July 4th. If my memory serves me correctly this film was a summer release, so that may the reason for the change of holiday.  Christmas just works so much better in the story.  In any case, just getting to see Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry perform their numbers is worth the look-see.  Albert Finney is also a very good Daddy Warbucks......I have friends whose little girls just love this movie.....and though I do not \\"just love it\\"......I find it entertaining and a nice addition to my collection of musicals on Blu-Ray.  And, I must say, the Blu-ray gives the film a whole new dimension ....and it looks more like it did when I saw the movie on its initial theatrical release.
B005FMZX9Q|3.0|I bought this watch for my son for christmas. He really likes the watch except for the band. It is fabric and already the fabric is fading. For the price that shouldn't happen. Now he will have to buy a new watch band.

B00AE2J1PE|5.0|i rented this movie on red box 4 the first time and fell in love with it!! it is a bad ass movie!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This the best series I've ever read and out of the movie and more movies to come and out of all of the books this is going to be the best.I give it 5 stars because Suzanne Collins deserves it. I recommend this book to everyone who loves action, romance, and THRILL!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|well great app but none of the cheats work. its too bad. But I still love the app it works great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a good book!!!! Can't wait to read the next book.... this book has so much passion and suspense it makes it hard to put the book down!!!!!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|well, it worked for a while, but then whenever I tried to open a file I needed for school it said file does not exist or cannot be opened. Which I don't understand since it worked before.
B00AW28HF6|5.0|Tsunami Connection is the first of a trilogy by Michael James Gallagher.It is a very readable fast paced thriller.His international settings are well researched.The book is very informative on related topics:undercover espionage,the Tango,wines.Gallagher manages a plot line with a lot of twists and turns adeptly.The book is peopled with characters who are very immersed in their \\"super-hero\\" mode but are also motivated by everyday emotions.We see the heroine struggle to balance love interest with her role as full Colonel in special operations department.The ending piques the readers interest in volume 2.Bravo!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I actually saw this movie first, then read the book and fell in love with it. He makes me cry every time, but I love Nicholas Sparks' writing.
B008AX18Y6|5.0|Courage in hiding is quite different and not so obviously heroic as displaying courage under fire. Rushdie shows himself, warts and all, in this biography. This takes true courage of the unheroic kind.
B00846REIS|5.0|Such a great book :) loved it! If u loved 50 shades of grey you'll love this! I couldn't stop reading it!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Good read especially right now. I have been suffering from the I'm not original syndrome and this book helped me see the broader picture.  Nothing new under the sun, is essential to understand and its ok to steal from others only if you run it through your own head which you really can't prevent anyway, you would have to work very hard not to put your own experiences and thought patterns into your work.  Rated 5 because reading this book felt like somebody through me life line.  To all my artist friends this is a must resd
B007FLHW3K|4.0|The MonkeyLectric 210 is a very effective way to get motorists to notice your bike. Even in low-power mode, the LED's are plenty bright! Mounting was very easy, although one clarification/addition I would suggest is cleaning your wheel hub *with rubbing alcohol*--it's a great degreaser, and grease/grim is the real problem for the hub-mounted battery pack.<br /><br />I haven't had to replace the batteries yet, so I can't say how long they'll last. I've only used my MonkeyLight for about 3.5 hours at low power so far. (Check for an update/comment later.)<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was due to weight/balance issues, which are probably insurmountable (unless you were to put two $50 lights on a wheel). I balanced my wheel as carefully as I could, but it still has a definite wobble due to the weight of the lightboard and/or batteries. But that wobble isn't enough of a problem to get me to remove this super-cool spoke light!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I enjoyed Brave but don't know that I would watch it again.  Compared to other incredible Pixar movies such as Tangled and Monster's Inc, I didn't find Brave all that exciting.  My wife and kids loved it though, so maybe it's not a guy movie.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is okay, but not very challenging.  However, I may not have figured out how to work it yet.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|Like all the Christian Bale Batmans, this is a memorable Batman story with great characters.  It's worth it just to see Heath Ledger's Joker.  Watch the whole series.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|No matter how manytimes I try I can't get out of level 6.  Maybe there is a way to limit the number of tries so you can move on to the next level.<br /><br />I think the birds are funny and cute.
B0014D6PCO|4.0|A great conclusion to a great series.  If you enjoyed the first two films in the series, this a must-watch.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|If you have recently retired and are thinking about new challenges and old regrets, this book will capture your heart.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Have seen Les Mis in NY and Boston and the voices here are the best.  If new to Les Mis, see the movie first as story line is a bit harder to follow.in the DVD.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|My, my--what a cast, including Lemmon and Pacino as desperate real estate agents. . Forget the old '50s and early '60s Jack Lemmon vehicles. This one is Lemmon doing Lemmon \\"on steroids,\\" and it's great stuff; his distressed ramblings in this film are often parodied in The Simpsons. The others in the ensemble serve as perfect foils. Spacey is evil corporate incarnate, as usual.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|The pacing of the movie was non-stop with a few scenes of no dialog reflection thrown in for good measure.    I wasn't a Judge Dredd fan before this movie, but am now.    Too bad the advertising was so horrible.    Almost no one saw this movie in theatres.    There was talk of a trilogy, but it grossed $32 million worldwide and cost about $50 to make.  [...]    So I'm guessing no sequels.    I bought my copy. Here's hoping.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Thirty-year-old construction worker becomes male stripper to make easy money. Soon, he and mentor approach a downgrade to dissolution. Slight drama, and somewhat off-putting, to say the least, unless you feel like ogling skimpily dressed beefcake guys--but it's ultimately an upbeat film.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|My husband and I watched this TV series when it was new, and it's fun to watch it again.  Peter Falk is great and there are many &#34;old-time stars&#34; in the casts.  The price for the complete was, in our opinion, very reasonable.  We were definitely not disappointed, and I don't think you will be either.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Pretty ponderous and pretentious for a moving comic book, but it's at least a half-star better than the awful and heavy-handed The Dark Knight (2005). Now and then some rousing good action can be found (helped by exciting score) in between the extended, darkly boring scenes reminiscent of the 2005 film. Takes a few cues from Star Wars and Escape from New York as well.
B005B0QYMM|1.0|Grave Encounters (The Vicious Brothers, 2011)<br /><br />...and if you thought, correctly, that Episode 50 (q.v. elsewhere this ish) was bad, let me introduce you to Grave Encounters, a movie that feels as if it was made by taking the script for Episode 50, giving it one more rewrite to extinguish any faint embers there might have been of something halfway decent in it, and then the loose, unbound pages of the script were tossed into the air and picked up at random--and then the movie was filmed in the order in which the pages were picked up. (Any page that was picked up upside-down or backwards was shot as-is, with the cast trying to make sense of upside-down language or simply inserting five minutes of silence per blank page.) Now, I hasten to add that the above is an artist's conception of what may have happened during the filming of Grave Encounters; I have no inside information in this regard. But that's certainly what it felt like to me.<br /><br />Plot: A burgeoning Ghost Adventures-style show (we find out early on that this is footage that would have been edited down to form the sixth episode of the series) arranges to spend the night in a haunted asylum. Unlike normal procedure, when the caretaker of the asylum is supposed to \\"lock them in overnight\\", he actually does, so the team can't do things like get extra equipment from the truck. Or escape, when they find out that unlike the places they normally produce shows, this one really is haunted. All they can do is wait for sunrise, and the return of the caretaker...<br /><br />...and I can't really get into what really made this movie so entirely awful without getting past that point, because that's where it all goes into the toilet--not that it wasn't most of the way there anyway, with acting that is at its best on the borderline of terrible, even worse lighting problems than one normally has with this sort of found-footage claptrap, etc. What I can tell you is that once we get to that point, the movie's sense of pace, which was already kind of wavering between \\"dragging\\" and \\"mumblecore\\", went over the cliff. I almost think I understand what Bros. Vicious were attempting to do with the pacing there, but without giving too much away, I'll say that it reminds me of the philosophy I have always believed James Joyce used when writing \\"The Dead\\" (if you want to write a story about dreadfully boring people, write a dreadfully boring story). And if so, I will give them that it takes guts to try something like that, because if it doesn't work, it's going to be a spectacular failure.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's exactly what Grave Encounters is. ½nse of pace, which was already kind of wavering between \\"dragging\\" and \\"mumblecore\\", went over the cliff.

B001EC2IXK|5.0|A great classic about prison life for irreverent and nonconformist Newman. Warden Struther Martin is oft quoted by young American men and some English teachers (Lesson 1: Now ah can be a nice guy, or ah can be one real meeeaaan sumbitch! Lesson 2: You got to git yer mind right! Lesson 3: What we have here is a failure to communicate... etc.) May seem somewhat familiar territory now, but only because this movie CREATED the stereotypes.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I becam an avid reader of Stephen King back in the 70's. I was looking forward to a sit down here with an old friend but found it to be a bit of a yawn fest. Nothing new, not even an interesting rehash. 2 D characters who fail to elicit any enthusiasm for their survival or consumption. Copyright 2011? Sad if true. Flat and dusty, like this rest stop. Save your money for another road.
B0000797IO|4.0|Very interesting comedy-turned drama, superbly directed and acted. Jennifer is stuck in a small-town rut, working in a discount store and married to an unattractive, boorish rube (John C. Reilly), when someone more appealing comes along, with unfortunate results. You'll love this one all the way as a drama and character study. Only gripe is credulity being strained a bit: in real life, small-town girls this beautiful, sharp and full of potential do not generally hang around in their dreary little home towns after high school, marrying the ugliest brute from high school and selling shower caps at the Bargain-o-Rama. But let's face it--that lovely face and everything else that Jennifer offers is a big part of the appeal of the movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. It was well written and I did like the story, parts of it were totally unexpected others not so much. But I loved the connection with the kids and between him and her.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|A fun and funny movie that both kids and adults can enjoy. The voices and animation are terrific.<br /><br />There is an adoption element to the movie that might be upsetting to kids who have been adopted or are/were in foster care, but overall the messages are positive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really enjoy this game very much but I really really really want an update! I hope soon but it is a really good game.
B000FC10WU|4.0|It was well written and kept my interest all the way through.  I usually figure out &#34;who done it&#34; with mysteries but didn't on this story till the end.  I really like when that happens.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|ive mostly seen the movie but i love the book and it so diffrent from the movie but i love it
098555780X|2.0|I bought this book based on reviews here.  this book covers some wonderful knots, but like all books, falls very short when attempting to show how to make some of the knots.  there are pictures of steps, but i find myself stuck i.e. between step 3 and step 4 where i can't look at the pictures and figure out what goes where. the pictures are really beautiful color photos, which are not necessary to show how to make knots: it'd been loads more helpful to have 50 black and white pictures (or line drawings) of how to do a knot then to have 15 color photos.<br /><br />imagine a traditional pretzel shape with line hanging on both ends. if you can figure out this instruction, then click purchase: blight the right running end through the left crook and put the standing end through the top bottom loop and tighten<br /><br />this book might make good use of time on a car/camping trip where you don't have internet access. especially if you have a group of people who have time to try to help you get between steps.<br /><br />paracord ball steps 3-6. ???<br />ringbolt hitch viceroy: step 3 to 4.<br /><br />a revision to this book that shows labeled line drawings alongside the pictures would be very helpful.
1601254679|4.0|Well put together, but you'll want to check the erratta on the paizo.com site, as theres' numerous minor mistakes on the stat blocks for the characters.  Very nice for 'plug and play' NPCs as well as drop-in pregen player characters, though.  Also gives a nice array of examples of how you can make characters of the same class different.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I Loved it! I was pleasantly surprised at the end of it. I can't wait to see the movie in February.
B004I744AS|5.0|It has been a great help in my school work. Like having the thesarus wih it too. Yes, I highly recommend it.
B008476HBM|5.0|People can often be dismissive of chick lit but all you need to do is read Pride and Prejudice to know that books based on men/women and their misunderstandings when done well can't be beaten. I go back to this book at least once a year and it only gets better and better.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|I originally saw this game on Table Top (YouTube, Will Whedon). I like it because it's easy to learn, no set-up necessary, and travel friendly. It's a great game for when I have friends over.<br />However, if you're looking for a story/strategy game, this is not it. This is a plain dice/push your luck kind of game.<br />Regardless, this is still a great little game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Didn't like the movie to this at all but thought the book was very good and descriptive. Great for any age but I think it would be great to get young/ older teens reading this. Great example of descriptive and creative writing.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I didn't think it would measure up to the original, but it was really good. Definitely an update to a modern idea of the future, in a really William Gibson-ish world. Even the soundtrack was right on par mixing in dub-step with the orchestral score.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|it's awesome!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great second book.  I can't wait to get the third book!! This one leaves you hanging so badly! Good call.
6301174240|5.0|it's awesome!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ordered and received fairly quickly without issue. Item as described.  It is an okay book. Thanks very much. Would recommend.
B000059XUP|5.0|it's awesome!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What an amazing book. So raw and real life. Not endings are happy ones but that what makes this book great. It's truth, which makes it perfect.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Well done J.K.  She has proven to me that her &#34;magic&#34; with words is still there and quite grown up.
B0096HJXXI|5.0|You must see this movie. It is one of my favorites. Tastefully cheesy and funny yet it is still a bloody horror flick. Also, buy the collector's addition because it comes with a bright green syringe highlighter. [[ASIN:B000LPS47U Re-Animator]]
B007G92QGO|4.0|...the twisting and turning ending is unpredictable. Well written in an easy page-turning style. Had me reading one more chapter.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|This was a good movie I liked it. It was well made and not boring which is pretty good for movies right now.
0061906220|5.0|This was my granddaughter's first Pete book. She absolutely loves it. In fact, it's so worn and taped that I purchased a second one. This is how she first learned colors.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Great movie!!! I really liked this movie better than I thought it was going to be. And I didnt have to leave my house to watch it.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I was forced to read this so I might be a little biased. Having read the book and seen the movie, it seems more suited for the 9 to 15 year old crowd. I can't understand why a grown-up would want to read this.
B00009MGKD|4.0|Purchased from zoverstock not knowing that their product would be zoned only for the U.K and when I contacted them, I received very slow condescending replies as if my problem was just 100% due to my oblivion!!! But the film is an adolescent favorite of mine
B002RVCD0U|2.0|I don't think the this movie even came close to the other 3  Terminators..... They tried to hard to re-vamp the series in my opinion.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Obviously you know where the film is going from the very start, but it takes quite a bit of time to play out.  There are components of the plot that seem token inclusions, that might add to the meat of things if fleshed out a little bit more.  You won't regret watching this film, but I'd say it's a strong rental rather than purchase-worthy as it's unlikely to be watched a second time.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|A great movie, great action, Great actors. I recommend this movie to anyone that like/loves the terminator series on tv or the movie.
B004TLM4Z0|5.0|Blackie Lawless can sing like very few singers can in the heavy metal world!  Simply excellent!!  Digital album sounds great, Surprisingly!  Like the feature where amazon stores your music in a cloud player.  Helps prevent loss, but remains to be seen how long the feature will be active.  Be sure to back up your music in case!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|this game is fun and entertaining. it teaches where the fingers go on a piano. i think that is educational in a fun way. i recommend it to anyone who wants to pass the time learning to play piano to some songs. for Christmas i played we wish you a merry Christmas, it was fun. also it has a mode where you can play it by timing your self. try it, you will like it.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I must admit, I love heavy metal, but this girl sings sultry like.  Messed up verses on some songs, but IT is very good!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|i am able to listen to radio stations locally and in NYC, you can roam and hear radio stations from other countries. i just moved away recently and this puts me in tune with the radio station i use to hear in NYC, its nice. i recommend it to any one who like to hear the radio.
1419705849|5.0|I bought this for my 9 year old grandson for Christmas, he loved it.  He has already read it several times and continues to read it.  Grandma made points. lol
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun, my son is always playing it. i haven't tried it, but he is constantly pestering me to let him play it. LOL mind you he has an xbox 360 and he is bothering me for my kindle because of this game.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I have relied on my &#34;old school&#34; Merriam-Webster Dictionary since I received it as a high school graduation gift.  It's nice to have my old friend in an updated digital format that is easier to carry around!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Really like the online version but this isn't nearly as good. Less games tournement is slow and hard to get right into it lots of lag time not as many credits. Very slow in gifting friends, not much benefit to prime players over all poor version of original.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is not challenging at first, but if you play long enough it becomes more difficult.  My only suggestion would be to cut the number of really easy puzzles.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|How can you not like facebook, good friends, good information and actually opens up the world to me. Where else can you &#34;talk&#34; to people from all over the world and get a true veiw of what is happening not just what the media wants you too hear.
B00656URU6|5.0|I love Yanni! I have purchased just about all of his music. His music makes you feel like you just want to be somewhere else, it takes and puts you into a whole new rim.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really love mahjong but wish it had some weird layouts. Layouts are basically always similar but it is a good game to relax with
B00003CXBK|5.0|Miyazaki shows real love for the nature. I love the little white characters that represent the health of the forest.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|it makes you think of prison in a whole new way.  it's so touching when they meet up in the end!
B009LREA1S|5.0|Not as good as Dark knight but still a very solid movie by Christopher Nolan. I can't wait until his next movie.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This film is too funny to describe.  My teenage daughter constantly repeats the one liners and I keep laughing.  Thoroughly enjoyable movie!!
B00A2IUDO8|4.0|If you are a fan of family guy them you'll love this movie. Ted is the funniest bear ever. Overall It's a good movie.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|i bought three for gifts and one for me. I listen to it all the time.  Will definitely get more of Phil Phillips
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read the whole series and at first it took me awhile to get into this third one.  But eventually it did get more exciting and I had a hard time putting it down.
1451696191|5.0|Bought this book for my 19 year old daughter, she loved it.  She then passed it on to her older sister who also loved it.  It was one of those books that they couldnt put down. Both finished it in about a day.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I haven't finished this yet but I am really enjoying the storyline and the mini-games.  There are also a few scenes that have surprised me,  in a somewhat scary way,  and I am anxious to see what's coming next.  G5 has continued to deliver good games and I have been fortunate to get them for a reasonable price instead of the $4.99 that they are usually listed for.
B0000AK7AC|5.0|Great family movie.  I did not expect to enjoy this movie but, to my surprise, it was actually quite heart-warming.
B008I43DYU|4.0|a smart phone without a calculatoris not too smart--i use this app daily never lets me down--do not hesitate get it
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man is another solid Vince Flynn read.<br />I know Special Forces Operators that consider Vince Flynn the most realistic writer for this type of action.
B000IZ6FLK|2.0|Despite a stellar performance from Christian Bale (who looks like a concentration-camp victim), this movie tends to drag along and is definitely too long.  Very depressing also.<br /><br />I would skip this one
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaitre is a very relaxing and easy game to play. it is a stress reliever however it can be very addictive
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was amazing, I read it in a day because I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a great read.
B0084LQHN6|2.0|I think people are hearing the HYPE NOT the music. I have heard worse but as DJ I could not play this just at any old hiphop spot. Sounds like a typical house song content typical and mediocre at best.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|it had a nice twist but the characters werent anything special and it took a really long time to get to the good meat of the story with the twist.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|They are so bright and love, love, love the elevate on them. I should have bought the carousel with both sets that I purchased. They are large and took up way more room in my utensil bin than expected. Each individual utensil is a bit heavy so holding for long periods.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is fun but takes a really long time to accrue money to complete the challenges and goals. but i would still play it
0689835604|5.0|Our 10 month old loves this book. I think it's the illustrated baby faces that babies love looking at and it's interactive. A good buy!
0316228532|1.0|I finished The Casual Vacancy and all I can say is that I absolutely hated it. The only good thing about it was that it ended and that it's not a series so I don't have to ever think about it again. I'm really happy I didn't end up buying it like I thought I would, only because of J.K. Rowling's name on the cover.<br /><br />Jo said that if you did not cry at the ending of the book, then you were a heartless person and she would never want to talk to you. I usually cry at absolutely everything. Not a tear. It was so anticlimactic and predictable. It didn't even really wrap up the story in any way. The story was dull, the characters were dull, the writing was dull. I would have rather watched 'Sit and Be Fit' with my eyes taped open for a week.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is supposed to be a dark comedy. I probably barely laughed once throughout the entire thing and it was when I read about Colin talking about wanting to kill himself when he and Tessa adopted Fats.<br /><br />Amazon, I wish I had never read this book. But I guess I'm happy I did so that I never have to again.
0671646788|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone. It explains how by stretching your mind and stretching your dreams you can achieve your dreams.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I'd consider this book to most of my friends and others who likes the whimpy kid series or very funny humorous stories
B003ODIZL6|5.0|See hddnjdjsdjdjsj dhdhs dhsbd d d d d d d e d d d d dd dvdvd d d d
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great book! Wish I knew this a few years ago. Great buy and you cant go wrong with building a better foundation to your knowledge.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I really enjoyed the different perspectives of narration. What a great idea to invite incorporate the format of the novel into the story. This really could be a collection of journal entries and letters!
0765325950|5.0|Great book, exciting finish to a great series!  Thank you Sanderson for finishing this amazing series in a way true to Jordan's vision.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|The effects were incredible, and used in service of an intricate but compelling sci-fi story. Nolan does a great job of keeping the viewer oriented while the story moves among many levels.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I chose this rating because there is nothing wrong with this product and I got it cheaper than I would have online at places such as Walmart or Kmart. I recommend this product to anyone and everyone because it is one that all ages will surely enjoy!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|What this movie loses with the fairly typical plot line of bad-boyfriend-matures-to-keep-girlfriend, it more than makes up in over-the-top humor. Nothing like watching a cuddly, talking teddy bear taking bong hits.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis turn in solid rom-com performances.<br /><br />This is not for you if you don't like a few raunchy jokes or Seth McFarlane's humor.
B003EI2EH2|2.0|Overall it didnt work for me - didnt lose any weight but gained some more and not exactly in muscle :) I followed it exactly as it is outlayed for a bit over a month. Then I just stopped cause I was gaining weight, feeling more sluggish and overall felt it was just wrong for me. I returned to a balanced diet of plenty of veggies, some meat, some carbs and three times a week an hour workout and lost the weight I gained and 2 more pounds. Am still on that and still losing. Maybe it works for other people though - just not for me.
