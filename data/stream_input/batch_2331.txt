B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Contains some songs that were previously released, but each is a different version.  The best song is Mojo man and the title track is great as well.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Very easy to use and I've had some cracked bottles but practice makes perfect.  I hope to come up with a lot more ideas on what to make with the bottles.
B006LSZECO|1.0|A real page turner. In fact you dont even have to read most of them. A big waste of time.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|While I love splashtop I do not like their new model for business. Their original app was free for a bit and then allowed online access using your gmail as the tie in. The newer app while improved in connectivity and other areas now requires a monthly (or yearly) fee to access your devices from outside your home network. This was my main use for the app. And because of this I will be sticking with the original even if it is not as seamless.<br /><br />This is assuming you want to be able to connect to the PC from outside your home network. As long as you are inside your local LAN this will work better then the original app.
B009S33I68|5.0|Great movies like \\"We were soldiers once, and young\\" are joys that withstand the test of time. But they must have a great story that they tell and the book tells a great story in words that they movie so ably depicted.
B009KEN87O|5.0|awesome game through and through. the look and the feel are there 100%. also the 3d twist on the pov powerup is ingenious.<br />if there was a six star option. this would get it hands down.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show. Amazon provides the perfect streaming videos. Good clarity. I was able to pick up where I left off when I had to step away.
B0051ANPZQ|2.0|I loved the book it was sad at Times but very cute and funny will read it lots of more times
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have the HTC Inspire and the stock folder organizer while good is a bit boring and limited.  After trying out the free version, I just felt compelled to purchase the full version.  Definitely worth every penny.  I've had this apps for over a year and there were issues with the apps initially but the developer were on top of things.  The apps got more stable with every update.  Highly recommend this app.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Neat app. Good look. Could use more directions on mini games. Worth checking out. Good t I me killer I like it<br /><br />Fun, not too hard

B00BWGISB4|4.0|Remix is definitely the best...made me want to get up and dance!  A few of the songs made me laugh...but in general I am really enjoying the album!
0451219597|3.0|So the Resistance and the Germans are in the midst of a raging gun battle in an open square.  Flick's husband is wounded and can't walk.  She picks him up and carries him across the square to safety.  Not drags mind you.. she throws him over her shoulder in a fireman's carry and trots off.<br /><br />Fiction is one thing, but this is just beyond belief.<br /><br />Overall the book is okay, but Mr. Follett is capable of much much better.

B005PK56TA|5.0|Loved all the episodes so much...left me wanting more! The acting and writing was absolutely amazing for a TV show.
B0018BF1KY|5.0|This collection is a great introduction to this fine, underappreciated guitarist.  Recording quality is variable ranging from adequate to very good, as might be expected in recordings made as long as 40 years ago. Some of the songs are repeated but different versions offer enough variation to minimize the redundancy.
B0011MZOEI|4.0|Was written well the stunts were amazing. Josh and Bruce were very good playing off each other. Bruce is great in everything. He can do no wrong in my book
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We just love it and tell everyone to watch it!  This is a winner for sure and we look forward to many more seasons.

B003QTUQGU|5.0|The story was rewritten very vell. The makeup and costumes were superb. Of course Johnny Depp and Mia were excellent and believable in there parts. Hellena and Ann were creepy wish made there parts wonderful. I saw it in 3d first which I hate but it was gorgeous just wish there was a way to wear the glasses without have ing to put the over my own. Love it anyway

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good read.  Interesting storyline.  Among his best books that I have read to date. Lots of plot twists and turns.
B009DA74ES|5.0|The show remains the same.  That certainly isn't a negative. Hank is still a slave to his impulses. Some new characters that are rather entertaining. The season ends on a major cliff hanger it had me super pissed that it ended.<br /><br />Overall this season is a B+, it's no season 1 or 2 but it certainly will keep your attention and force you to play the next episode.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|I thought I'd heard/ bought it all, but noooo! When I opened the package it was a pleasant surprise. More new tunes ( unreleased), and wonderful packaging made my day.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is a great example of a game where I feel that the choice I make really matter. It's fun.
B000GGSM94|5.0|Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me is the 7th The Cure studio album and is a mix of Alternative rock, gothic rock, New Wave, and post-punk. Tracks that I love are Why Can't I be You, Just Like Heaven and Catch. This 2006 deluxe contains 2 CD's. The first contains the original album and the second contains RS Home demo's, Studio Demo's, Studio Alt Mixes and Live Bootlegs. The booklet contains all the lyrics, photographs from the time of the recording and well-written music  notes. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B0072NWKEC|4.0|Having recently visited Prague, I was intrigued by the setting of this novel, whose author I had not previously read.  I found the book to be well written, with good character development, and the story was embedded well in historical fact.  Yet despite the main character's ambivalence about his life and actions, he still undeniably participates in one of the darkest periods in modern history.  That's undoubtedly one of the points, but disturbing.  Definitely worth a read.
B002RI99IM|5.0|This is an original and intelligent work, stemming from experience, much thought and learning. Highly communicative, it's utterly engaging from the start and subverts all notions of predictability. The result is a certain feeling of liberty and a desire to step aside from preconceptions into intellectual exploration.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I really enjoyed this book on two levels; as an historical novel and as an introduction to a philosophical thread I had not been aware of before reading this book.  The only shortcoming was the subtitle.  Epicureanism could have indeed led to a modern western world, but instead seems to have been lost once again.
B008M36EEI|4.0|Found this movie to be beautifullly acted, directed and written. The scenery was amazing. Would recommend this movie to any with an appreciaton for the non studio concept film.
0345803493|5.0|There has been so much hype about these books that I was worried that they would not live up to all of the hype but they actually are very good books. Quite racy but very, very good stories. A very complicated, deep love story and I really enjoyed them all.

B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|OK - I rarely will write a review on something and I think this is my first review on Amazon, but this album is AWESOME!<br />Dido has gone back to a more electronic sound [thank God!] and her voice has never sounded so ethereal!<br />If you're a Dido fan, you MUST own this album. \\"Let's Runaway\\" has changed my life and I've only owned the album for less than 24 hours, and I've listened to it like 100 times! \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Love to Blame\\" are some other standout tracks. I plan on keeping this album in rotation for weeks to come!
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|After watching Batman Begins just a couple of days ago for the first time, this movie was not gritty. The honest policeman Joker guard character was unbelievable, also Batman in the final 45 minutes. If someone killed your childhood friend or fellow policemen, the Joker should not have been spared.<br /><br />Then the scene of the people in the boats to be bombed, unbelievable. Like the Michael Keaton Batman movies I saw over 20 years ago, the 2nd one of this series was grossly inferior.

B0091REZMW|5.0|i am loving this game. it is challenging both to the mind and patience. strategy is a must to stay in the game. also, if you do not want to use up all your diamonds for energy, you must be patient enough to wait for your energy to recover.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Have used many different kinds of headsets this one takes the cake!<br /><br />If your looking for wireless freedom, and your looking for great sounding headsets? THESE are the ones!  The bass driver on these are amazing, the highs are just on point not too pitchy and the mids are rich.  I have always had issues with headsets not having enough bass and these will not disappoint you! The pleather ear cups are amazing good sound elimination.  You truly will not be disappointed!

B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I'm going to focus my review mainly on the 3D aspect of this Blu-Ray, and about how the movie compares to Avatar 3D-wise, which is to date the visual benchmark by which other 3D movies are judged. As for the movie itself it's an amazing piece of film-making whose plot and pace reminded me of the movie Castaway.<br /><br />Now, onto the 3D:<br /><br />When I originally watched the movie Avatar in theaters, its 3D effect blew my mind. For me, that movie is the benchmark all 3D movies should aspire to achieve, when it comes to 3D implementation. Over the years, and after watching avatar in the theater, I've watched a mixed bag of 3D movies that initially led me to believe 3D in the living room would never achieve the quality of what I watched in the theater when Avatar knocked my socks off and introduced me to the world of modern 3D. Then, after a period of exclusivity with Panasonic, Avatar 3D was finally made available on Blu-Ray. To my surprise, after watching avatar in 3D Blu-Ray in the comfort of my living room, it looked EXACTLY the same as in the theater. Perfect. Visually astounding. And one HUGE detail: Crosstalk free. (For the uninitiated, crosstalk if the effect present in many 3D movies in which the edges of objects on the screen look blurry and doubled. Many people not only find this effect annoying but it's known to case headaches and even nausea in many moviegoers). The fact that Avatar was 100% crosstalk free led me to one conclusion: 3D Blu Rays can look every bit as good in your living room as the movie originally looked on the theater screen, as long as the movie is done right, shot right and encoded right. Just like James Cameron did with Avatar. Which finally brings me to Life of Pi.<br /><br />This Blu Ray movie packs the best 3D I've seen, after the hundred or so movies that have graced my TV screen since avatar. The 3D effect in Life of Pi is absolutely flawless. Crosstalk is absolutely non-existent. I can't stress this enough. The fact that this movie nails its 3D presentation and it contains zero crosstalk whatsoever, along with the masterful way in which director Ang Lee shot this movie take your movie experience to a whole new level. When you're watching the movie the absence of crosstalk allows you to forget for a second you're watching a Blu-Ray movie and that you-re wearing the stupid glasses and simply allows you to immerse yourself in the visuals. Your eyes get used to the new dimension they're perceiving instantly and you end up losing yourself in the lush landscapes and in the incredibly rich color palette this movie brings to your living room. The colors are so vibrant, the objects  so sharp and defined you almost feel you're looking through a glass.<br /><br />Unlike gimmicky 3D movies that try to impress you by throwing objects at your face, the 3D effect in Life of Pie is used instead to immerse the viewer in this fantastic world. It's done tastefully, technically impeccably and with amazing results. And unlike said gimmicky 3D movies in which you feel like you're just watching a 2D movie with dark glasses 90% of the time, and the 3D is just reserved for fast paced action scenes that make up probably 10% of the movie, in Life of Pi 3D is present on the screen almost 99% of the time. Like it's one more color the director was able to play with when painting this masterpiece. You don't need to wait for an action scene to see the 3D in all its glory. As soon as the movie starts and you're presented with the lush visuals of an Indian zoo, you see the 3d in all its glory. 2 minutes into the movie the narrative takes you to the protagonist's living room where he is having a conversation with a book writer. Two characters sitting in a living room talking. A scene that most 3D movies wouldn't even consider introducing 3D on, (let alone using their 3D budget to enhance), yet in Life of Pi, as mundane as a scene like this could be, is giving the royal 3D treatment and you see the characters, perfectlydefined in the foreground, and the rest of the living room, purposefully out of focus in the background, like if it is the background of the actual living room you're sitting in.<br /><br />Whereas avatar is a CGI fest, (and that's a flavor of movie I also certainly enjoy) In terms of visual effects, Life of Pi is just a different animal. CGI, while definitely existent, is only one, amongst many aces under the  director's sleeve. He also plays, with color, (and boy does he!) contrast, angles, landscapes, and also the masterful 3D implementation to submerge you in the story.<br /><br />To sum it up, not only is this an amazing movie totally worth watching, but this 3D Blu-Ray is one you will definitely want to keep on your shelf whenever you want to show your 3D setup to your friends. Along with avatar, it is in my opinion the finest example of 3D done right you can have in your collection. Definitely reference material for 3D quality, and also proof that whenever you get crosstalk ridden cheaply done 3D movies, is not because the technology is not there yet but because the movie was not shot or encoded properly, and basically they were cheap, lazy, or both. The technology to make your living room 3D look as good as the best theater 3D can offer, is definitely there. And Ang Lee took it and ran with it.defined in the foreground, and the rest of the living room, purposefully out of focus in the background, like if it is the background of the actual living room you're sitting in.<br /><br />Whereas avatar is a CGI fest, (and that's a flavor of movie I also certainly enjoy) In terms of visual effects, Life of Pi is just a different animal.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|Modern, sexy, abrasive, bold, atmospheric, minimal, layered, honest and warm. Pure Depeche Mode release of 21st century - has finally arrived! If Playing the Angel was \\"return to form\\", Delta Machine is a genuine Depeche Mode piece. A new milestone of their 30+ year career and an album that can proudly stand with their finest work. Frankly, my hopes were very high after hearing magnificent Soulsavers album The light the dead see and with Mart experimenting with Vince Clarke on Ssss.<br /><br />Chances are, you will have to deal with it for a while before fully sinking in. Almost every song here has unusual rhythm structure and twists. Just when you think you \\"got it\\", the song will go the other way.<br />At first you may think that songs are strange and weird, but once you begin to appreciate them, you'll notice that this is the work of genius with very complex songwriting, real emotions and great lyrics. Dave is really giving his best, he tries to suit his voice for every song, from down to earth, bared, wistful singing to preaching and shouting. There are no obvious singles, aside from maybe Soothe my soul, but don't let that bother you - Delta Machine is *very* rewarding journey, full of hooks, great bass lines and atmospherics. On Always there's a beautiful strings work, not heard since Home or Halo.<br />Alone is in a league of its own - possibly THE best DM tune and a hallmark of their career!<br /><br />Just like Black Celebration, these are collection of songs that are mutually very different, but work surprisingly well together and carry the same intense emotions. Depeche mode and us - fans should be very proud! Welcome to my world!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I liked this book because it taught me to be grateful for every little thing in my life. It has daily assignments to help you remember to be happy and thankful. Much more helpful than The Secret. I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to change themselves for the better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I ran across the app on my iphone and got so addicted I downloaded it on my kindle. I definitely recommend this.
B00B0NDQPC|4.0|The other day I was watching a TV program when this excellent singer was having an interview,  At the interview it comes that she sings old time music.. When I herd her singing, in my mind,I recreate my old times.  I like her singing very much.  Her voice is so soft, at the moment I herd her sing, I was fascinated.
0345457692|1.0|I rarely stop reading a book midway through, but I couldn't make it past page 200. The sentence structure is too poor for me to ignore, and the verbiage left me unable to concentrate on the story itself. Admittedly, that may be a good thing, since the character's actions were unexplainable, and the scenarios didn't seem to fit together.
0345529057|5.0|If you like Sci Fi, read this!  If you like intrigue and deception, read this.  If you are really into the show, maybe wait to read it because the 3rd season seems to be deviating from the book (and book 3 was my favorite!)
B0091REZMW|4.0|very fun game to play lots of extras to keep things going for you while u keep moving. good for kids and adults as well.

0316223239|1.0|After reading all the positive reviews I forced myself to listen to every word of this book in audio.  then, I was angry with myself for not dropping it after the first chapter.<br /><br />It might have been the casting. The voice used for the character of the little boy had me rolling my eyes constantly. I'm not sure if this was because it was poorly performed or if the dialogue was bad.  The little boy is incredibly intelligent as his mother takes great pains to educate him beyond his years - somehow he has failed to master English even though he has had a loving adult focusing on him every waking moment of his life.  Please!  Hard to believe and painfully difficult to listen to.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|My husband and I watched the entire season 1 in just over a week. Hoping season 2 comes out soon! Preordered it from Amazon and can't wait to get it. Fantastically written and the performances are A+. Just an all around great series.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|This was a terrible movie.  Flashing back and forth, very difficult to follow.  Depressing.  One of those movies that make you realize you have just wasted two hours of your life and cannot get them back.  Do not waste your money on this one.  More importantly, don't waste your time.
1476733953|3.0|2.5 stars.  I am at a loss as to why this series (books one through five in this omnibus) has garnered so many five star reviews.  I found the premise of the cleaners hard to accept, and while the writing and story arc in book one were good, the remaining books grew increasingly bloated and contrived.  I just wasn't drawn into the story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is ridiculous.<br /><br />The man is perfect. Body, hair, rich, private jet, mansions, can pick out clothes for women, yet controlling, stalker ish, and bossy. It seems more like an abusive relationship to me, yet women claim to love this book?<br /><br />I would file it under the Fantasy Porn section. Ironic that women who despise their husbands with porn, but like this book. And it's a trilogy? The author is laughing hysterically and rolling in the dough.
B000OVLIQU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and have been telling Beatles stories to all of my friends ever since reading it.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Amazing direction by Ang Lee and extremely nice cinematography with nice music and strong cast. Definitely a must watch movie with family and friends.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This is a awesome movie. I just wish as a fan of the 80's and 90's that it would have more of a play and spinoff on all the famous characters in the video game world as it was made out to be. But then again, if they were to do that, it would have taken away from the characters that Disney was trying to develop in the movie. It is Wreck it Ralph.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is perfect for the family and worth it. The character voice over's were awesome and fit each character perfectly. Well done Disney. Will there be a part two? I hope so.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Works very well in giving a pleasant ambient noise to help me relax and sleep.  More choices than most white noise machines.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|loved it, followed the story line from first one perfectly, loved the ending hopping to see more of these movies.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Wow!!!!!! I wish they would come up with another one like France an  Florida. I hope that it happens. The way I play this is addicting
B009AMANBA|5.0|Best portrayal  of President Lincoln that i have seen in a very long time. Battle fields carnage very realistic. Overall great movie.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book is very thorough. It's main message is to get off the wheat in all forms. I tried this, and lost a  little weight, but I think I ate other things to make up for not eating wheat! But I did not like the kindle edition because there are recipes and things to which I would like to have easy reference and they are hard to find on Kindle unless I wrote down all the page numbers. With a paper copy, I could mark the pages with actual bookmarks and take the book in the kitchen. I have trouble doing all that with the Kindle.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Loved all the action, Did not like what they did to Bond's old car. Loved the new Q and Miss Money Penny(wow).
1451620829|3.0|I was a huge Kiss fan as a kid and while I still like to blast their music occasionally and revel in the spectacle that is Kiss, I can't help but feel pretty sad for them as individuals. Although this is one man's account of the band, I'm pretty sure none of them have any values other than money, sex, and substances. In terms of having a \\"side\\" or story to tell, I'm not sure what Peter's story really is after reading this book because he goes back and forth between loving the guys, hating the guys, loving the guys, hating the guys, focusing on money, not focusing on money, focusing on money, not focusing on money, honing his craft, not playing at all, honing his craft, not playing at all. So in the end, you really are just left thinking that Peter is one confused, likely mentally unstable, guy. I'm not sure I needed to read the whole book to figure that out. Dumb me: I kept thinking he is going to have an epiphany, clean up his substance abuse, clean up his language, stop putting focus on others and basically become an adult. But you get the sense Peter is still basically a teenager in an adult's body. All that said, I didn't expect a ton from this book other than some light reading for a spring break and that's really what it was. Nothing insightful here (other than perhaps how much punishment the human body can take from substance abuse) and a few details about some of the recording sessions that I didn't know. In general I think Peter, Ace, Paul, and Gene are best when they are on stage and in character. Off stage, they are just sad human beings.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|I rented this movie for my grandson to watch.  He is only 19 month old so he didn't watch much of it, but my daughter and I watched it and enjoyed it.  I was surprised to see some of the old arcade-game characters in it.
0316077046|5.0|It's refreshing to read a series that the main character is a boy. The world that has been created is fascinating and the story line keeps you glued to every page.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|This movie was too long -- though entertaining.  Even though it was entertaining, it seemed like it was The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring remade with new characters (and some previiously introduced in The Lord of the Rings trilogy) and a new &#34;fellowship&#34; adventure.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This book is a story, although unorthodox in title, that the reader will want to return to.  It's sad to leave it behind on the last page.  The characters are developed well, the time period is vividly represented.  A wonderful book!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Amazing...  Love the characters, love the stories, love the costumes, love the set design! My husband and I both enjoy this show very much.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love it!!!<br />This game is amazing and addictive I will recommend this game to all of my friends and family..................
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Excellent reading...the story a little different than most, buy sad, happy and exhilerating all in one.  It is a book I will recommend to friends and family.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|As a voracious reader, I feel the need to preface this review by saying that I have not read the book this film was based on. Not sure if I ever will, but there it is, I haven't. And thankfully it's not one of those \\"you HAVE to read the book to understand the movie\\" type of things. I thought the film started off slow, but it helped establish Pi's character rather than just toss him on a lifeboat with a tiger and wait to see what character development happens afterward. The reason for going by \\"Pi\\" was creative. And the telling of the story via flashbacks was a good choice; you got the sense that even so many years later, Pi still carries all of this with him every single day. The actors appeared very well cast in their roles -- I liked that Lee cast a lot of unknowns (or at least, unfamiliar to the Western world), because then you weren't distracted by preconceived notions of the actors' abilities and you could focus on the story the film was telling. Suraj Sharma did a particularly spectacular job, considering how his tiger companion was a character completely created in CGI. From a technical standpoint, Life of Pi deserved every Oscar it scored (Visual Effects, Director, Score, Cinematography). The score was subtle but stirring when it needed to be, and seemed to evoke more emotionally than the actors could, probably due to Pi's somewhat stagnant position on the lifeboat in the middle of the ocean. The night scene stands out to me as far as effects, score and cinematography are concerned because it just takes your breath away; between the infinite number of stars and the bright reflections of fish underwater to the breaching humpback, the entire scene was incredible to watch. And enough praise cannot be bestowed on the crew who worked to bring not just Richard Parker but all the other animals to life as well -- they all acted very realistically in regard to each other and to Pi himself. I have friends who've seen this film and thought it extremely boring -- maybeit's jsut me, but I can't understand how something so intriguing could bore someone. Broaden your mind with this film, it's a good one.
B00BIPCXJM|5.0|This is an engaging, sophisticated series that deals with unusual subjects such as Orthodox Jewish customs and military courts martial.  As an avid binge-watcher, this is at the top of my must-see list.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its very cool and its an fast paste game amazing and i like it when It upgrade itself thats clever
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|As a first time reader was going on others recommendations. Once read, I enjoyed so much, I purchased two more books. Enjoyable to read. Easy mystery.
B008EQI72U|5.0|I loved this film. The art of music used as subversive counter culture terrorism strikes a chord in all of us tired of mainstream &#34;music.&#34;<br />A lovely film.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Forget the remake -- THIS is the one!  Although &#34;Night of...&#34; set the stage for this one, this was THE movie for grisly, horrid zombie gore entertainment!  And with THREE editions of the movie in the pack, it demonstrates the potential of the storyline, if allowed to develop.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Can't get enough of the laughs from this movie.  We enjoy all the characters and the time spent together watching it!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|If you like the new Sherlock Holmes series, no words are needed. If not, no words will convince you to read the book.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|Good story. Grandkids really liked it. Great 3D effects, too. Might be a little intense in some scenes for younger kids, but our 4-year-old grandson likes it and has watched it more than once.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A great read!  Get it now!  Now I can watch the movie... Read this book in just a few hours.
B004APVI1G|4.0|The storyline has a good message, though some of the scenes might not be suitable for some younger kids. The 3D is great. Worth watching more than once.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Like all Nicholas Sparks books, this is a real page turner.  He truly paints an authentic picture of an abused woman desperate to escape her husband's control and brutality.  The characters in the book are real people making the story pretty believable.  Loved it!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Nothing new with this. as youe xpect it to be... You should know what you want before you get anythinng here...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't think I would get into it, but once I picked up the first book, I just couldn't put it back down till I finished all 3.
1423113462|5.0|I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to 1) wants to read more book by Rick Riordan and 2) likes adventure books
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I have a very short attention span. This game has surely kept my attention. It  very fast pace and keeps me wanting to play more. I'm definitely gonna tell my friends on FB about this one.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This was a thriller all the way through and I think one of the best Bond movies in a long, long while.  I would highly recommend this one!  Definitely keeps you locked in to the action.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Bought this book for my granddaughter who saw it on the big screen originally. She loves this movie. Especially Rebel Wilson an Aussie like herself.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|Although this movie was a little slow at times my wife and I enjoyed it.  The idea of the movie appearing to be shot on a stage and characters that were frozen in scenes was very unique.  I never expected this and it was an unusual effect, however it worked quite well.
B00340ESIS|5.0|If you wish to become a screenwriter and a successful one at that, Blake Snyder's &#34;Save the Cat&#34; is a realistic and awesome book for you to consider! I have gained a lot of knowledge from it, and I intend to read it over and over again, because there is so much to learn from it!
0385349947|5.0|Very inspirational. I have been recommending this book left and right to my peers. It's a tough world out there and Sheryl Sandberg really lays out how to find the confidence to be a successful woman in a man's world.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Love it! Keeping in touch just got a little easier. It's nice having the same content previously only available for the desktop/laptop all in the palm of your hand.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I like action movies somewhat, but this just didn't hold my interest.  Beautiful scenery and nice effects, but thats not enough
055338466X|1.0|Hawking is profoundly disappointing in this book.  This work is , in many parts, a philosophical work, not Hawking's strength.  Hawking seems unable to see the implications of the positions he argues.  For a more detailed review, see:  [...]
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 3 of Walking Dead was very good.  The show carries a good story line between the characters along with all the zombies walking amongst them.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Completely spell binding from the beginning. A true tour de force.<br />Read with great pleasure. I highly recommend this mystery novel.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|The writing is very different in this novel. It received great reviews, but I was not a fan of the writing style or how slow moving the story was.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|FABULOUS SERIES!!! Love it! Totally hooked on it. Recommend this to all! Series keeps you going and going, can't stop watching it.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This was my first experience with this author....I might give her another chance, but wasn't overly impressed with this book.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This is a really great movie to watch.  After knowing that Gerard Butler was nearly killed by one of the waves shown in the film, it was a hard film to watch at times, but it is so worth it.<br /><br />I'm not going to do the &#34;spoilers&#34; thing, but I will say, this is very much worth watching outside of what the critics said.<br /><br />In truth, the critics need to go surfing to know just how hard it really is, before critizing this film.<br /><br />Very well done!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not my favorite book but still good I feel like I want to cry in some part l think it was ok
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is really good best game I have played addictive but very fun would highly recommend to teens and kids extremely good
B00C1E8E7E|2.0|Tyler, The Creator along with being atheist (no problem) then converts to drugs which prior he said he would never do. Due to the pressure of other OF members (Domo and Taco) I assume he gave in. I was never to fond of him before, but I prefer Goblin then this. Due to his lyrics being cliche he has conformed to his fellow 'rappers' by talking of drugs, sex, and money. I thought he was original but I guess I was wrong. I personally like Answer, Colossus, Trashwang, and Tamale. Four of Eighteen. Tyler... Tyler -sigh-
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Talented, creative, moving, uplifting, music that soars like the wind.  Can you tell I love this album?<br />I caught a brief sampling of these guys on PBS and ordered the CD.  It has been in my car stereo for over a week and I listen to it, non stop, over and over again! For me it is a perfect start to my day, positive, \\"feels good\\" energy that I take with me throughout the day.  Listening to it on the way home washes away any angst from the day and moves me like nothing I have heard in years.  Spectacular!  Do yourself a favor and add this to your music libary, you won't be disappointed. The talent and joy of these guys is amazing...
0345525558|5.0|This book had everything I hope for in a novel--one that makes it impossible to put down and is just as good from the first page to the last -- good writing and character development with an ability to learn something at the same time--  all within a touching storyline.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like the product, HOWEVER, It no longer loads on my kindle.<br />I can down load it, and it brings up the game , when I try to<br />open the &#34;challenge:&#34; picture it goes back to the load screen<br />I can no longer use this app.  Any suggestions?<br />I have deleted and reloaded it 4 or 5 times to no avail.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is a great movie and completes the set I have.  Would strongly recommend this for anyone who loves the Lord of the Rings series.
B006MGB31Q|5.0|Nervous about the whole region thing, but these blu ray discs play perfectly on my Panasonic player.<br /><br />The movies look great on blu ray.
B00AERRKHA|5.0|Well up to her normal standard.  It was nice to see Ivan finally grow up. It was great to get this book as an ebook.
1400069289|3.0|This book was great up to the middle. The rest of the book are fillers. You can read the first half and you would have gotten the idea. The last half of the book are examples that illustrate the premise of the book but not very well.
1452101248|5.0|Love this book. Came in great condition. And recipes are wonderful. A must read for any foodie. Ottolenghi is great.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is such an amazing story! The rising action never ends! Ever time I turned the page it seemed to make me laugh, cry, or literally gasp. The ending was definitely nothing I ever expected. I'm definitely going to continue the series to see how this UNEXPECTED twist at the end plays out! I'd Absolutely recommend this for someone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am truly (or how ever you spell that) addicted to this game. Not the kind of addicted like I would kill some one if they erased it off my device, but the kind where I need my daily dose of it. You know what I mean. Anyways it's an awesome game and totally worth it to download it if you haven't already. =)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good book! I was surprised to like these books as much as I do and was happy to see their little love story unfold.
B004N868DS|5.0|This is another item I did a lot of research on before I found this perfect product.  Roccat is a company in Hamburg, Germany that makes gear for the gamer.  I do a lot of online PC gaming.  Mostly FPS's (first person shooters) so I need quick response, smooth movement, and other options.  By other options for example, I mean choosing which side I may choose for different types of control during gameplay.  I used think that surface didn't matter a whole lot.  Now I know that is not true.  A great gaming mouse (see my other reviews) is used with this mouse pad but I have tried various other types of mice and they even have their performance enhanced..  The ROCCAT Alumic Double-Sided Gaming Mouse pad is double sided as stated.  Two different textures.  One side can be used for speed, the other for more control.  The mouse pad is made from aluminum so it is not flexible, which I have no problem with.  If you transport your gaming gear a lot you will need something large enough to transport this is.  On each corner of the pad there are rubber \\"feet\\" to keep it from sliding.  There is a wrist rest that is not attached to the mouse pad, unlike the Razer Vespula (which I also researched).  This is another helpful \\"option\\" with this mouse pad and this can be helpful.  If you game a lot, have a good gaming mouse and this mouse pad you just may be unstoppable.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is great to use a sound machine when going to bed.  I love the different sound options and that you can mix various sounds and choose which is most predominant.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is fun and helps pass some time. I help play it with my four year old daughter who loves horses and she loves it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is number 3 on my game list. Super fun, challenging, and a time killer! Would recommend to others to play!
B00114RKT8|3.0|Perhaps it all seemed too familiar since I just rented \\"Lincoln.\\"  Although that legislation to end slavery unfolded over weeks, this one took 15 years.  One lone British M.P. stood up in parlaiment to voice his objections over angry shouting and dirty looks.  Yet each year a few more listened approvingly. Once Napoleon's threats ended the royal family promised to stay neutral and the British public felt they could afford a change of heart.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game, I beat it in a week  though, not that challenging. Overall fun game, and hope one day the levels get harder!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is very fun to play.  I just can not. stop playing.  it keeps your attention for a long time. you should definitely get this game.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|It was the 1st time watching les miserables and I was wowed. Since I never read the book I immediately bought it to better understand the characters. My next plan is to go see the play.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|This has Drew Barrymore in it as a child as well as Elijah Woods.  Became a classic SciFi movie for the ages when it came out all those years ago.  Enjoyed by all ages.
B007ZMD14I|5.0|I love guitar music and Slash.  I love the song Anastasia and decided to download the whole album.  I'm so glad I did!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Useful. I live and work in different states. This app is helpful in letting me know weather conditions in advance.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed the journey that this book took you on and I thought that the mystery was very intriguing. Not how I expected it to end but I enjoyed the twist at the end something you can always count on if your reading a Baldacci thriller. Can't wait till I get to read the next one!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was looking forward to Skyfall for a long time. And I was not disappointed. Daniel Craig is, in my opinion, the best Bond. And Skyfall is the best Craig Bond movie. Javier Bardem really brings a certain creepiness and ruthless personality to the Bond Villain as Silva. Silva is different from Le Chiffre (Casino Royale) and Greene (Quantum of Solace). He's much more intelligent, more ruthless, and he is actually a great threat to Bond and MI6.<br /><br />If Skyfall turns out to be the last one for Craig, then Craig would be ending on a high note!
B007OLYQ4E|5.0|This is still fresh, exhilarating and to the point..Capote at his best! Sharp social commentary, life lessons, and career commentary..hah. Holly spoke to me in the 60s in college; still feel her today😎<br />She paved a blazing trail; there's been no one like her. Countless imitations, but she's the One.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|Pretty different from other movies that are similar. Sinister is a very original concept and it is an excellent movie. The twist at the end isn't mind-blowing, but quite disturbing.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke has never been my favorite actor, and he wasn't particularly great in this one. But this was a great movie nonetheless.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|i really loved the cd it was it was very awsome it was great!!!!!!! great cd awsome love it it
B004BLJQOK|5.0|First off, Chloe Grace Moretz was the perfect choice to play Abby. Second, this is one of the few Foreign to American movie remakes that I've seen lately that I actually really enjoyed.<br /><br />It follows the original pretty faithfully but adds some SFX that are not over-the-top and I feel it is actually superior to the original. There is one part from the original that they did not end up putting in this version and I don't think it took away from it at all.<br /><br />The friendship between Abby and Owen is quite incredible and is very believable especially considering when Owen finds out about her secret. The subplot of Owen dealing with school bullies adds nicely to the story and reminds us of just how rough it can be to be a kid.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. It's very different from other &#34;vampire&#34; movies and it is not a &#34;scary&#34; horror but an excellent one.
B0058FOB2K|4.0|Nice addition to your music library. The songs are relevant to her life and there are some danceable cuts that work it out.
B004MPESSY|5.0|I was extremely skeptical to watch this at first. I really liked the original and thought that this would be a horrible remake. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This version is bloodier and gorier than the original by a mile. The two major differences between the remake and the original are (1) An extra man and (2) The revenge murders. The original movie had a tagline of &#34;This woman has just cut, chopped, broken and burned five men beyond recognition.&#34; This was a mistake as there were only four men in that movie. The remake adds that 5th man. For those who haven't seen it, I won't spoil who it is.<br /><br />The revenge murders Jennifer commits are completely different and much more gruesome. I was worried they would be too over-the-top with them. And while they were certainly extreme in the brutality and torture, they were absolutely fitting. She gives each man the revenge they deserved based on what they did to her.<br /><br />The only thing I would have liked to have seen is where/how she gets out of the water she falls into. It would have been good to see that - just for the sake of plausibility. Still, a great revenge movie and (dare I say it) superior to the original.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|When I first heard that Evil Dead was being remade, I wasn't happy. I've grown tired of reboots and remakes and I felt that remaking Evil Dead was akin to trampling on sacred ground. After discovering that Raimi and Campbell were backing it, I gave in and joined the the party, my uptight \\"Dead purist\\" friends be damned. This version starts out with the same creepy cabin in the same creepy woods but with a new group of twenty somethings unwittingly walking into the slaughter. A new element is introduced when we find out that the gang is trying to help their friend Mia recover from a nasty heroin addiction. Making the trip is her estranged brother David who wasn't around when Mia had to deal with their mother's death. Needless to say, there are a lot of family issues that the two never hashed out and hard feelings are being felt.<br /><br />  If being drug out to a creepy cabin in the woods by her friends wasn't bad enough, things are going to get worse for Mia. Ignoring all blatant signs to get out of dodge,(decaying cats strung up on the ceiling, A blood stained floor)the group decides to go poking around the basement where they find a book made out of human skin. The nerdy hipster friend(Eric) can't keep his hands off of it and decides to read it, going so far as to pencil trace the words that have been scribbled out. His meddling causes forest demon(s)to spring forth from their dormancy and they're quite smitten with the venerable Mia. To make matters worse, her friends take her warnings as the paranoid ramblings of a junky coming down from a fix. Soon the gore hits the fan and one by one the friends get possessed and off themselves and each other in increasingly gruesome ways.<br /><br />  I was pleased with Evil Dead. The acting was a little wooden at first but when Mia and David's past was established,I felt that it gave the plot a solid anchor. The gore was turned up a couple notches from the original but there were times when it reached absurd levels. I couldn't help laughing aloud when the characters kept using duct tape in attempts to reattach severed limbs. with that aside, Evil Dead delivers a solid film that even \\"Dead purists\\" will enjoy. I'd say that the film is more \\" cringe enduing\\" than \\"terrifying\\" but still very enjoyable none the less. I challenge you \\"Dead purist\\" to check it out!
B00004RJ71|4.0|Blood In, Blood Out (Bound by Honor) is a great movie. One traumatic experience sends each of the main characters on separate paths and it is sad how their relationships get strained.<br /><br />The realistic look into the destructiveness of drug use and the harsh realities of prison and gang life gives this movie a lot of power. There are quite a few scenes where Spanish is spoken with no subtitles and, while it is not critical to understand what they say, it can be frustrating if you don't know what is being said.<br /><br />Still, it's a great movie and I highly recommend it. All in all, it is almost identical to American Me starring Edward James Olmos. However, Blood In, Blood Out is 10 times the film American Me was.
015206057X|5.0|Fun to read aloud with our one year old grandson. He loved the rhyming and illustrations. Great way to connect with children.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|2013-04-05
B008LY5VHE|4.0|I loved this movie as a kid, and I think it held up well over time.  The shark is fake, but the mechanical behemoth is more pleasing than many of the CGI effects we have today.  I enjoyed watching it in HD and would recommend it to others who like movies for entertainment value instead of as a high art form,.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is the best game ever but I think the characters are to expensive...still love the game!!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|As just about the rest of the nation, I really enjoy this show. (Spoiler) I can't wait for the Governor to get whats coming to him, but we'll see where he disappeared to in season 4.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 was awesome ! Adding new characters and exciting turn of events. I can't wait for next season. I am so addicted !!!!
B0053O89KG|5.0|What can I say.  If you loved Firefly, you will love Castle.  Be sure to get season 1, 2, and  3 as well. And if you haven't seen the TV series Firefly (only one season) and then the follow up movie Serenity get them as well.  As Richard Castle makes references to the show numerous times in different episodes.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|I must say I'm very disappointed in all the swearing that goes on in the book. Minutes could have been shaved from the text. Is that the way people in $4 billion plus companies talk? Definitely not a book you want to recommend.<br /><br />The content itself is very useful, and even insightful if you don't work for big companies: it's all about how IT is like a plant floor (manufactoring), and the authors make a very convincing case. Learnt a lot here.<br /><br />If you read this because it has devops in the title, you'll be disappointed. There's very little devops as currently understood, only the last 10%. It feels more like they had to wrap up the story as the authors ran out of the paper. The first 85% of the story is much slower.<br /><br />I was surprised about the amount of all-nighters, weekends and skipped holidays. Is working for a big company worth it? I suggest you better don't take that second mortgage, and enjoy more time off.
B008J34466|5.0|I'm not a huge pink fan. I really just bought the CD for one song, but all the songs turned out to be very good.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Each of the men who have played James Bond has had one movie that stood out for each of them.  This one is Daniel Craig.  To me he is a great James Bond.  Played it the way he should have been played, with an edge to him and not as a playboy.<br /><br />When it was explained what Skyfall was I was stunned.  I really hated to see what happened to his boss.  My husband and daughter agreed with him that it would have been neat to have her be James's long lost Grandmother or something like that.  But it didn't happen that way and she wasn't.<br /><br />But the man who portrayed the bad guy, he truly was a bad guy, truly evil and didn't have a nice bone in his body.<br /><br />Great series and looking forward to the next installment.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I watched this movie with a group of college friends, and needless to say, if you are squeamish don't watch this movie. There is quite a bit of violence and other aspects that contribute to this movie's MPAA rating. I would not recommend this for families. Also, there are a few inconsistencies within the movie, but I'm afraid that if I share those, I may potentially spoil portions of the plot for those of you who indeed watch it.
B00BHU2A7I|1.0|Anthony Hopkin's portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock, as well as the storyline of this film, was as weak and unnourishing as the watery potato soup and sawdust bread served to WWII POWs in Nazi Germany. I regretted having missed the theatrical release, but having just watched it \\"On Demand\\" I am grateful I squandered only $5 to suffer through this POS in my home rather than $12 at the Cineplex. A performance by Hopkins cheaper and more degrading to his brand than anything he has ever done, including that \\"Red Dragon\\" stable liner. What a disgrace.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I watch quite a few movies (usually one movie every other day or so), and how \\"Searching For Sugar Man\\" is put together is similar to that of a VH1 \\"Rock Docs\\" episode. Much of what I saw in the movie I expected from having watched the \\"60 Minutes\\" interview prior to watching this. Music fans will love this movie, and those who like quality stories told through film will also like this movie.
B000I8ERVM|4.0|(I was saddened to see that Roger Ebert died today.  I watched his show for many years, first with Gene Siskel, then Richard Roeper, and even the same show with A.O. Scott -- maybe the best living movie critic now -- and others.  I even watched his own show with Ignatiy Vishnevetsky and Christy Lemire, a very opposite pair that I thought worked very well.  Even though Mr. Ebert is now gone, his reviews will live on forever.)<br /><br />This film makes the assertion that people should only be held accountable for what they know, what they believe, when it comes to their actions.  Kind of a \\"Good Samaritan\\" concept, in the sense that, if you follow your beliefs and really try to help someone else, even if everything fails, you're really not guilty.<br /><br />Now, I usually don't like to start a review with a theme, but in this case, I think that it fits.  This is a supernatural thriller and courtroom drama rolled into one, but many people would argue that it's a religious movie.  That would not be true.  The theme of the film works inside and outside of religion for sure, and I always appreciate a film that picks a strong theme and sticks with it, as this one does.  So kudos there.<br /><br />And surely kudos needs to go to Laura Linney, one of my favorite actresses.  She is so good that she almost made \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\" fly, even though the film was so so.  And she gives another Linneyesque performance here, giving it her all as an attorney who's agnostic defending a priest who is very religious.  And that priest is Tom Wilkinson, a very fine actor who also always gives it his all, as he does here.  (If you haven't seen it I also highly recommend \\"In the Bedroom,\\" another film that allows the viewer to formulate his or her own opinions.)<br /><br />I'll give a pretty big recommendation to this film, even on a second viewing.  And a goodbye to one of the best film critics ever.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is a great movie, even for those who aren't movie buffs. With how this movie is put together, there is little wonder as to why it won as many awards as it did. Finally, if you have access to a Redbox, do that, because it is cheaper than paying the rental fee on Amazon.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|The premise is a stretch, but it is a comedy and it is fun to see Harrison Ford play the grumpy anchor man. I enjoyed the movie.
B00BF11STU|4.0|While \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is a quality movie, it could have easily done without much of the content in the initial and middle stages of the movie. Now while trying my hardest not to spoil the movie, be prepared for over an hour of background content before getting to the portion of the movie that is in the vast majority of the trailer.
B0014JGDUC|4.0|These are great if you work in a place where you risk getting unwanted (and possibly icky) fluids on your feet.  The problem is that because they have no holes they get really warm. It's still worth it for me though.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This movie is worth watching if you are a young adult or older. Personally, I do not think this is as good as \\"40 Year Old Virgin\\" or \\"Knocked Up\\", but it is nice to know that Judd Apatow casted his wife and kids, making the movie more real than fake like the vast majority of Hollywood \\"family movies.\\" As with any Apatow movie, be prepared for coarse humor. I would only recommend mature teenagers to watch this movie, definitely a mature audience movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love AccuWeather! I have it on almost all of my electronics. I check on what is happening during storms. Very Helpful!
B002RVCD6O|5.0|One of the darker movies, and you fully appreciate that the challenges Harry faces go far beyond his life and troubles. Warning:  Main character death.

B00APACSJG|5.0|What can I say?  Has Lois McMaster Bujold ever written a bad novel?  Can't get enough of Miles adventures.  I have read everything written by this author.  She never disappoints.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Really love the new Bruno Mars album. Very good music :) Perfect music for summer, dancing or just chilling out.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|Jo Nesbo's writing has improved out of sight since this first book.  This book is quite often clumsily written compared with later works but the ideas are there  Pity he couldn't rewrite it.  Also I felt the translation probably did not help  Despite that it was still a readable book.
B00371XIJE|5.0|How beautiful story, it is amazing how much this animals can love a person, a teaching lesson to the humans to be faithful and that to love someone is unconditional. Not very often feeling at this days. I didnt stop crying, I really love this movie, and more amazing to know that was a true story. love it.
B00129H7VS|5.0|excellent series! very emotional and touching. The real heroes finally recognized! Best series ever by far. Product was worth the money

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots of fun attention getter,I lose myself for hours playing it.Some scenes are trickier than others, but overall a fun game
B00028HBKC|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time at the theatre. I was blown away. After a few years and ordering it online, I watched it again. Awesome movie. Hard to watch some scenes, but brought much appreciation.<br />Great Amazon service. Got quickly.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I love the history behind the story.  The characters were played well by the actors/actresses.  There was just enough action to keep me entertained.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just recently became interested in Downton Abbey.  I watch the first two episodes on my iPad and was hooked!  I watched all three seasons in a period of about a week.  the characters are great, the Abbey is beautiful and the costuming is amazing.  I can't wait for season 4.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a great app! Good features, different updates nice world tours and last but not least great characters and beautiful features once again
B007EDZ20O|4.0|Mr. HItchens does bring up a number of compelling arguments.  I'd love to read a book taking the opposing viewpoint next.
B0000045OX|3.0|Numerous factors in the execution of this audiobook reading rankle the sensibilities of this listener. (Thus I begin my rant.) First, the CD is an abridged version, which I didn't realize, or I would never have purchased it (my bad). HOWEVER, they would have been able to incorporate much more of Austen's wonderful novel had the superfluous classical music segues spattered liberally between chapters and scenes been eliminated! If I'm listening to an audiobook, I want to hear the book being read!  In addition to these flaws, the volume consistency of the reading is very poor.  One moment I'm turning the radio up to catch a whispered conversation between Elinor and Colonel Brandon; the next, Margaret's voice is screeching out of the speakers, and I am frantically trying to turn down the volume! These drastic variations in volume occur throughout the reading.  Finally, I found the core material chosen for the abridgement to be lacking, making the entire presentation seem rather rushed.  Exchanges that can be found in many of the other adaptations of S&S are omitted here, such as Marianne and Willoughby's extended (and scathing) observations on Colonel Brandon, and much later Marianne's lamentations on her own conduct to Elinor. These and many other scenes that would help show the various character's transformations as the novel progresses are given only cursory attention--a sentence or two where pages are provided by Austen.  All in all, I would suggest passing this rendition by if looking for a comprehensive telling of S&S.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|This product works with my iPhone 4, iPhone 4s, iPod Video, iPad 2, and iPad (sometimes called 3). If you want to play MP4's or stream HBO/Showtime/Starz on the go including Directv app, there is nothing better. It is pricey but the alternative is to purchase other cables that you will have to play with to get working.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|As with most in the \\"Basics\\" line, this is a simple no-frills camera case.  The build quality is good, though, and I've found it useful when I don't want to carry a larger case.  I carry a [[ASIN:B001G5ZTLS Canon EOS 5D Mark II SLR Camera)]] which is pretty large.  This case can accommodate it but it's a tight fit with a longer lens.  The rubber base is nice to keep it from sliding around when on a table, etc.  My only complaint is the balance, which feels kind of awkward to me.  I usually carry a [[ASIN:B000P3ZB42 Tamrac Photo Sling Pack (Black)]] which I feel is more solid.
030759565X|5.0|She writes like she is your best friend telling you about her day - love it!! The recipes are spot on!
0061766089|4.0|I enjoyed this book as a study on the influence of design.  The book lacks the kind of 'step 1, 2, 3' that other books attempt to provide but I think it's intended to be more food for conceptual thought.  On that level, it delivers.
B000TR1D1O|5.0|If you are feeling a bit low and music is a way to retune yourself I highly recommend Louis Prima!  He can make you get up and dance in your living room.  The remastering is good and the band does swing.
1591391105|5.0|Transitions in the workplace can be tricky.  You need to make the right moves early before things ossify into routine.  You encounter assumptions to be overcome and pre-conceived ideas from previous management.  This book is a good guide for navigating these tricky waters.
0439023548|5.0|Amazing book! I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend reading the trilogy if you enjoy post-modern worlds, false utopias and rebelling against the government!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I just could not put this book down. I'm now eagerly awaiting then next part, coming out later this year.<br /><br />This is a fantastic read and easily matches the Mistborn trilogy.

B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Works well on the Kindle Fire. The graphics are very nice. It was worth the money to get rid of the ads.
043902353X|5.0|Amazing book! I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend reading the trilogy if you enjoy post-modern worlds, false utopias and rebelling against the government!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This was recommended to me by a friend who said it was the best.  It is a good book if you are into teenage romance, or any romance.  I am not a romance fan.  It is about first love and child abuse.  It did hold my interest, but only because it was recommended.  Not sorry that I read it but do not recommend it to my adult friends.. They are beyond this type of book.
B004QBWU02|5.0|This movie never gets old and a lot of fun to watch. Brings back a lot of good highschool memories.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super addictive love it must download updates keep it interesting and its fun to challenge yourself and slyour friends on facebook

B0094BB4TW|5.0|this is the best app ever!!!!!!!!!! I love facebook so much so this is the perfect app for me!!!!! :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm a little bit in love with Hugh Howey's characters and his writing. I'm a big fan of dystopian novels and this is my new favorite. It is a tightly crafted novel with rich characters, themes and plots. The characters are haunting me but I especially love how he uses them to explore the themes of community, group psychology, free will, love and power. I also appreciate that the sci-fi element is finely balanced as a support to the main themes and characters. This book is easy to recommend to all kinds of readers because the characters and story are so compelling. I think you will be glad you gave it a try.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great characters and a haunting story. I particularly enjoyed the dialogs. The pace of the timeline was well done and the story moved smoothly through history.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A thoroughly fascinating journey into the hearts and minds of these fully developed characters. An education into how mental illness distorts thought processes, and the devastating impact that this has, not only on those who suffer from the diseases, but on their families and those who love and care for them. (I'm a retired psych nurse) Quick brings the reader right into the heart of their struggles and foibles. And shows us that amid the sadness there is humor, with the bizarre there is &#34;normal&#34;, amid the heartbreak there is always hope. The title is perfect.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|That's really all I need to say...this set is completely amazing.  David Attenborough is the perfect narrator and the visuals are so stunning.  Also contains videos on how the film crew went about filming...those are just as fascinating as the actual DVDs.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Love it lot of love the characters and allies definitely worth the download you will not be disappointed with this game
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It's very addicting game and very fun<br />Whoever made it has a good taste for video games<br />And it sort of teaches responsibility for animals
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My son absolutely loves this app! He plays it every moment he can get his grubby little fingers on my Kindle!
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|This case is just what I've been looking for.  It is padded without being bulky, a great color (red) and fits my Fire like a glove.  It protects my Fire in my messenger bag so that it doesn't get smashed against my other gear and because it's red it's easy to find in the cavernous thing.  I can't think of a single thing that could make this case better!<br /><br />PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\\") feel free to post it below.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Claire
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|My husband is a HUGE fan of Twilight & doesn't care!! The first day Breaking Dawn part 2 came out he was already on the hunt for a box set that had all five movies. He was getting frustrated because no one anywhere had a box set yet & still today don't. So I looked around online for him & viola the ONLY place to have a box set!! We bought it & he loves it!! LOL.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read!! I would recommend to anyone! :) Can't wait to buy the next!! I found it truly hard to set down.
B00006AW63|1.0|I was ecstatic to receive one of my favorite childhood Disney movies on DVD in the mail and had been awaiting its arrival for almost 12 days. When I had finally received it, it wouldn't play on any American device because the DVD was apparently shipped from London and wasn't recognized to play in the U.S. I was very upset.<br />I would make sure that the DVDs you order are \\"American friendly\\" and will actually play before spending your money.<br />I still don't know what to do about this, as I have never been dissatisfied with an amazon order until this experience.
B001AITGWE|5.0|Yeah, it's over the top.  But the point is well made (if perhaps a tad overwrought).  Still, it's Dirty Harry and Charles Bronson from Death Wish combined into a thoughtful analysis of the modern dilemna.
B005MMYCY6|5.0|A movie that hits home in a number of ways.<br />Levitt plays your classic late 80s/early 90s dirtbag to perfection - a role not quite mastered in this way before or since.<br />That was worth the price of admission to me.<br />Portman and the kid were a bonus.<br />Anyone could have played Wilson's role but that's no knock on him.<br />It is just a great, somber story highlighted with some dark & sick humor carried through by some talented acting.<br />Whether this movie leaves you amused or depressed, if you have a decent soul & a sense of humor you will somehow be impressed at the end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Book 3 was my favorite book of all three.  Very suspensefull, and full of suprises.  So sad the series is over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway suffers! Its so addicting to play and keeps you busy. Its so fun! I could play it for hours! :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absolutely loved the hunger games series. Would definately re-read later on.  Can not wait for the last two movies to come out.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Could not put it down, I laughed out loud many times. Tina was incredibly candid, and unapologetically opinionated at times.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|The only thing that I didn't like was that some things were over used to the point where it became a little annoying.  Although that might be a positive thing, that is to say I am never going to forget the phrase &#34;You only need to win once.&#34;<br /><br />I loved that this book is short enough to read in one evening and it's brevity in no way means it is lacking in great content.  I have made way more highlights and notes per page in this book than I normally would which shows that this book takes the typical Mark Cuban no nonsense approach.<br /><br />I will definitely use this books stories and rules in sales meetings and the everyday sales environment.  I would recommend it as a read to anyone that doesn't just want professional success, but is planning for that success and looking for any advantage they can to reach their goals.<br /><br />-GJFV
B0015AARJI|3.0|I liked that the controller works really well but I thought it would come with the cable to connect it to the ps3 at least, but it doesn't so I have to buy a charging station or a cable to connect it.
B001KQEE0U|4.0|I liked all the songs but the one song which i do not know the name, only some of he lyrics was not there. I'm going to ask around and see if anybody know the title then i'll be back for another set of songs.

B008B68J2G|2.0|Just judging by how my 10 year old daughter plays with these dolls, this set does not really have much play value.  It's really just a couple of cheapie plastic chairs, a table, and some props.<br />She seems to have more fun playing with the dolls with one of her friends, so they<br />can act out little pretend scenes and make the dolls talk to each other.  And they can<br />use a million other toys are props that are just as good as this stuff<br />(i.e. LEGO blocks, plastic cars and trucks, bits and pieces from other play house sets, etc).<br /><br />Really, if you didn't see \\"Monster High\\" on the box, this thing could look like a collection<br />of random toys from your kid's toy box... maybe a Barbie table and chairs, and a circus wagon<br />of some sort.  There's nothing \\"Monster High\\" about it, particularly.<br /><br />You can slap \\"Monster High\\" on anything and sell it as an accessory, but if the name \\"Monster High\\"<br />weren't on the box, would you actually bother to buy this?  Would it even look \\"monstery\\".<br />I don't think so.  I don't recommend this.  Waste of money.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love books, I have read all kinds of books great, good, bad, and everything in between! This book is really good I think it is a must read for anyone!  I feel like everyone can connect to at least one part of this book if not many of them.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|At first I thought this was a cute story, then kind of sad, in the end it made me very thoughtful. We have all met people like the characters in the story, but how often do we really stop and think about how events in childhood can shape our lives. In the end this story made me stop and think &#34;what if&#34; things had been different........
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Good story about an agnostic neurosurgeon whose NDE leads him to re-examine his faith and come to believe in OM and an afterlife. I have always believed in God and Heaven so the book reaffirmed by beliefs but wasn't life changing.
0425264351|2.0|I was disappointed by this book.<br /><br />Lee Child was inspired by John D. MacDonald's brilliant character Travis McGee.  Jack Reacher is a cartoon of McGee.<br /><br />In a week's time, Reacher kills some 12 or 14 men (I lost count), with no remorse, no drama.  It is not dramatic fiction novel killing. It is video game killing. It is just hack and slay with nothing behind it.  Is this a military MP or a soul-less killing machine.  I don't care how jaded you are, you don't kill a dozen people in 7 days and just shrug it off.<br /><br />By the middle of the book, I realized Reacher is invulnerable.  He never gets a scratch let alone suffers a credible thread of death or serious injury. Again, he is a cartoon character, not a fiction novel protagonist.  By the time he took on 5 men at once, I knew he would take them all down without a scratch.  Where is the drama in that?  Why bother reading on to see how your hero deals with adversity?  Where is the satisfaction in overcoming those odds when it has the same ease as space invaders or packman. Here come 5 enemy -- bang bang bang bang bang. Dead. Done. Next.<br /><br />Boring.<br /><br />There were so many mistakes in the novel, it is obvious this British author has never held a gun let alone shot one -- from a .44 magnum blowing a man out of his shoes, from saying a shotgun has a 20-degree cone of fire.  Child is completely ignorant of firearms, right to the end when a blast from a shotgun churns a mountain of money into confetti.  Ever fire a shotgun into a mountain of static paper?  Nothing happens. A mountain of money is extremely heavy and nothing would happen other than the 7 pellets of 00 buckshot penetrating the paper and leaving a bit of powder residue in the pile.<br /><br />I gave the book 2 stars because the writing was solidly strong enough to be a \\"page turner\\".  Lee Child has a lot of potential as a writer, and has a great imagination. But I seriously question how this got past the publisher with the shallow video-game main character and the numerous mistakes.<br /><br />Well, at least I will save myself from having to waste my money on any more books about Jack Reacher.<br /><br />What a mess. I almost gave this book 1 star. It is that bad.  But it moved briskly and I just shoved my tongue through my cheek and around to my ear so I could finish this awful book.<br /><br />I was told never look down on published work but there was a lot in this book that just insulted my intelligence.  There was some stellar writing but a lot of really bad junk.hallow video-game main character and the numerous mistakes.<br /><br />Well, at least I will save myself from having to waste my money on any more books about Jack Reacher.<br /><br />What a mess.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The movie was great! So I had  to read the book and was pleasantly surprised as go good the book was!
0061537969|4.0|Extremely good book that moves well and has good twists.  The characters are genuine and true to themselves.  The writing is sound and is clean and good enough to be a page turner.<br /><br />The racing insight sounded genuine and the way the characters dealt with the deepening plot was very sincere as well.<br /><br />Great book that read quickly, held my interest and the main characters won me over.<br /><br />The ending was brilliant and fabulously satisfying. I absolutely loved the ending from the trial resolution to the very end in Europe.
B004AUNSX2|3.0|Interesting movie. It did drag in a few places and was confusing at times but all in all it was OK
B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard so much about these books I just had to read them for myself.  It is a very sweet love story and after awhile you even skip some of the more detailed parts. The story line is the best.  It could have been written without all the explicit sex and been just as good.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app! It even allows you to change the color of the battery, which I think is pretty neat! This app helps identify exactly how much time is remaining as well as for every activity.  Try it; you won't be disappointed!
B001BFFTO0|5.0|The wifey got me these as an early xmas gift, I wore them to her xmas party and ended up drinking too much. I ended up dancing and doing stuff that I should've not done....long story short I ended up walking home, no joke it was about 20-25 miles. When you're drunk nothing phases you, well after i got home from my 7 hour trek (San Antonio) I noticed i had no blisters or hotspots on my feet...i love these boots, I wear them everytime i going to drink since i might be walking home all night....GET THEM!!!!!

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I admit - I'm not a big gamer.  I do know a big about games though.  The slight references to many of the games I grew up with made me happy.  But none of it overshadowed the great story this movie has.  :)

B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|I thought the movie was done in good taste, even though it has sexual content, it was not vulgar or malicious.<br /><br />At the same time it had a plot and was entertaining.
B00BWGISB4|4.0|Been waiting a few years for this one and as always, NKOTB doesn't disappoint! I like that Donnie and Jon got more vocals on songs on this album. I just wish there were more faster paced songs then ballads - not that the ballads are bad! Great buy for any pop fan. :)
B007REV4T8|3.0|It was entertaining, but not as good as I expected. The chases were too long<br />in the movie, but over all it was ok.

B0067AC5KA|5.0|If you can get past the beginning of the first book you will be hooked. Lots of minute details but it somehow flows very well. Very smart and well written with excellent cast of interesting characters. If I had any criticism at all it would be to comment on how odd it was that characters continually turned off their cell phones so often, regardless of how much crazy and urgent stuff was going on. It just seemed really odd. Might have made more sense to put their phone on vibrate! Lol<br />All in all a very engrossing  and and addictive series of books!! I would definitely recommend to serious readers but maybe not to anyone that likes light easy books.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is a great book hope u enjoy this book just like me<br />(Spoiler alert but Greg does not get what he wants AT ALL)
B00B2V66VS|1.0|They added to much to this one. It totally takes away from it's originality. It's like they read all the reviews and put in every detail that everyone mentioned...SMH!!! I prefer the first. But what do you think?

B00C7L8DM2|1.0|I am a big Aaron Eckhart fan so I decided to fork over $10.99 to watch this movie before its in theaters.<br /><br />The first half was good and the 2nd half the movie fell apart.  It is as if they built it up and rushed the ending.  It was very predictable and was almost very similar to Taken 2 at the end.  This is not worth the money, wait for this one to hit paid cable stations and watch then.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Loved this show when it was on the air, still watch repeats occasionally on TBS. And what a great price for this set!
B0028IDXDS|4.0|My son doesnt drop his paci as much with this Wubbanub since he can hold on to the monkey... i love the idea and think it is great; however, for the price, I thought the plush toy was going to be larger.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game does its job. it is fun and it isn't super complicated. they also did a great job with the graphics and have done better withbthe sounds.
006145205X|3.0|I enjoyed reading most of The Rational Optimist.  Author Matt Ridley is a good writer, and I found his stories of the evolution of society to be quite compelling.  I particularly liked his contention that specialization leads to advancement and prosperity in a society.  His arguments for this are detailed and engaging.  I found myself thinking about this principle as it might relate to other things (Should I really make dinner?  Wouldn't it be a better use of my time to do something I'm better at and pay someone else to cook?).<br /><br />And the upbeat nature of the book is refreshing.  Ridley basically says that people have always faced challenging circumstances, and they've always found ways to adapt, so there's nothing to worry about.  Nice!  Unfortunately, his logic is not necessarily solid there, and, as I've found, some of his supporting material isn't entirely accurate.<br /><br />Ridley does a lot of cheerleading for how modern farming has exponentially increased the amount of food that can be produced per acre.  He makes the introduction of dwarf wheat sound like one of the best developments in history.  And at first I agreed.  But since then, I've learned more about it and realized that, although crops such as this might allow massively increased production, they introduce problems of their own (likely worse than the problems they \\"solved\\").<br /><br />I think The Rational Optimist is worth reading, but do a fact check on things that are surprising or that don't sound quite right.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Ok this game is great. Graphics are nice. Decent gameplay. I love dinosaurs. Only issue i have with this game is that the popular dinos like stego and t-REX cost as much as 30 to 45 $$ alone. So my advice is to keep your wallet away from this game otherwise without the upset of a t rex for roughly 490 game dollars, this game is great. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Happy gaming.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is me favorite novelist and he didn't disappoint with this one.  Very quick action and very hard to put down!
0439023521|5.0|What an amazing book, it really is.  I definately loved it, but the second two books not quite as much.  It's compelling, a page turner to be sure.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I spent 99&cent; to get this really in-depth complex game a while ago and I've found that the only thing that could make the game any better is if cheats could be used on any of the illnesses after beating them on the brutal stages. Other than that this is one of the best games on my kindle fire and it has great re-play value.
B00BHMEALA|1.0|Wish I could review the movie but after I bought it I found out I have to have wireless connection to watch it. So I have not been able to watch it yet. When I bought it Nothing said I had ti have wireless connection to watch it. Disappointed.
B00AEFVRB2|1.0|When am I going to learn to check reviews before watching a movie? This is a lousy movie, there's no way around it.<br />1- The screen play is poorly adapted from what can only be described as a sketch of a play. The story just doesn't develop and the dialog is halting.<br />2- A lot of the acting is bad. Sure McConaughey and newcomer Juno Temple are excellent but all of the others give transparent performances. When bad acting is as consistent as this I tend to think it's the fault of the director.<br />3- Very, very, graphic violence. Watching this movie made me feel like I was suffering. In a movie where the storyline doesn't go anywhere it seems that the entire reason it exists is to showcase blood and<br />4- Beaver. I don't know the last time I've seen that much bush. Seriously. When a viewer sees something jolting and intruiging like naked lady parts it makes you think something interesting is going to happen so you stick around and watch the movie when you otherwise may have turned it off. Then nothing interesting happens, you were duped.<br /><br />I hope this director finds something better to do.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is great because it's just like temple run, but better obstacles.I think it's funny when he dies because he displays against the screen!!!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I LOVE the fact that there are no adds while i play this game.  I think it is one of the best games ever!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I could spend hours on. Its very fun and addictive. My family has a lot of fun playing it.
B002BWQ50Y|5.0|This book is simple but powerful! I think you have to be to a place in your life where you are ready to hear the message.
B00280LYIM|4.0|I think this was the best Percy Jackson in the series so far.... but there is still the final book :)
B007SGM084|5.0|Great series, full of fun narratives and interesting story line.  I still wish the trilogy didn't end.  Bring on more!
B00BF123WG|4.0|Interesting movie showing the rest of the story regarding finding and killing OBL.  Enhanced interrogation (EI) was a son of a bitch... not sure what I think of EI.
B004JY0KP8|4.0|I received this watch as a Christmas present. It works great as either a casual or dress watch. The face has a nice shimmer. My only complaint is that it is a tad difficult to read the time when the light is dim, due to the fact that the hands are the same color as the face. Definitely not a deal breaker though. The watch really is beautiful and at a reasonable cost.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Fun a-Capella music well performed, some humor, some eye candy, and some heart combine to make a quite entertaining movie.  While a bit predictable in plot, I found the minutes flashing by and indeed was disappointed I wasn't going to hear more by the end.  There was a lot of Glee, and fans of that show will certainly like this, but it fortunately lacked the cheesy high school drama and preachy nature.  Also mixed in was the feel of some of those 80's classics to which it pays direct homage.  Watch it if you are in the mood for music and a light evening's entertainment.  I caution you though that you might find yourself fumbling for your CDs or hitting up the Amazon music store afterwards for some forgotten favorites and perhaps a few new mash-ups.
B007XIO9TU|5.0|What can you say? Johnny Winter Live,Hes got a great band and caring management now so things are working out good and sounding good! Any Johnny Winter fan or a fan of blues will love this!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Not a remake or rehash of the original but very decent action sci-fi movie that was surprisingly good.  If you removed a lot of the comic-y cheese from the original and crossed it more with Die Hard (I) you would end up with this re-imagining of the old Stalone flick.  This shares little with the original however and stands in its own more raw and graphic category.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and could easily recommend it to anyone that wants a mindless action distraction who isn't afraid of some gory grit.
B00B9LNJ9I|4.0|I love Dido.  If you're used to the music from her other albums, this one is a bit different.  I'm not a big rap fan, but there are enough songs on the album that I enjoy to make up for the rap.  If I had known there were songs with rap, I may have just purchased the individual mp3s, but I'm sure the album will continue to grow on me, and my son (who enjoys rap) will probably love it.
1455508977|3.0|Overall a fun cute love story about two people finding each other, under some very unique circumstances.<br />This movie is based on a book, which I haven't read, so I can't compare the two, or reference the book's story (sometimes a movie from a book will omit things or change things).<br />The story follows a Marine, who comes across a photo of girl while deployed, and believes finding the photo, has saved him, several times from death.  When he comes back home, he decides to try and find her, to thank her, and the story unfolds.<br />There's a lot of really great dialogue, good characters, the building of the love interest and tension in the story.  I was impressed.  I didn't expect it to be as good as it was.  I like it when I'm surprised and I get sucked into a story.<br />It wasn't a 4 star for me, for two big reasons.  First reason, the ending, and how the story resolved the issues with the kid's father, felt very weak to me.  It felt like a quick fix, to just eject him from the story (without giving away what happens).  The second issue I had was with the Marine, specifically the character's military \\"persona\\", which also felt weak.  That I blame on weak character building, the foundation of writing any story, which points to the writer of the story.  Since I haven't read the book, I can't say if it was the author or the book, or the screenwriter.  Though I will say, I had the same exact issue with another one of Mr. Sparks book-movie's \\"Dear John\\". So, that makes me think it's really on the shoulders, the weak military persona in military character's, of the author.<br />I would watch this movie again, and would purchase it for my library.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I found season 2 filled with many exciting twists and turns.  Really love this series, and am thrilled I can watch it free with Amazon Prime.
1400069807|5.0|'Salt Sugar Fat: How The Food Giants Hooked Us' is one of the best food books I have ever read.  It's an incredible look at things I have suspected for many years that the mega food companies were like the cigarette companies, knowing EXACTLY how to hook consumers and using our innate weak willpower and science to control us and make a whole lot of money doing so.  With the power of salt, sugar, and fat the food conglomerates have taken this down to as far as they can go to figure out the \\"bliss point\\" for humans and extract as much money as possible without any concern for health in the short or long term.<br /><br />This book is very, very important and I am happy to say that I think in the past few years that people ARE starting eat smarter and headways are being made.  Like with most things in life (look how hard it was to get better health care for Americans and gun control reform even with all the mass shootings that have taken place) this process will take time but I like where things are headed.  People are eating smarter and we are more educated that ever before.  The options for eating organic, gluten-free, and water vs soda sales have made a difference.<br /><br />I really hope that this book becomes a bible of sorts for people to learn to eat smarter.  It's not an easy thing to do.  The companies have made the food so tasty (at least until we give it up and learn to love REAL food again) and the hook is in so deep that most people can't change their eating habits overnight and even slowly it's difficult.  But with sound logic and the understanding that we CAN fight back and learn to love basic REAL food like meats, veggies and nuts that humans have the potential to be healthy yet again.<br /><br />An absolute gem of a book that EVERYONE should read.<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1451695195|5.0|I read this because my mother recently passed. I had read &#34;Heaven is for Real&#34;, which had given me hope and comfort, so wanted to find out more about people's actual experiences of Heaven. After reading about his book in the newspaper, I wanted read it because he is a neurosurgeon and I was interested in his perspective as I have read that most scientifically minded people dismiss such experiences as neuron activity while the brain is shutting down. The author does his best to explain how that theory could not have happened in his case, but I felt it was missing something, maybe the opinion of other doctors who treated him. Maybe they didn't want to give an opinion. Anyway, it is a fascinating read. Though I hope when I die I don't have they experience he describes as the earthworms eye view!
B008ASLK8A|3.0|As a lover of Sherlock Holmes, I had my doubts about this franchise.  Robert Downey, Jr. as the cool, ruminating, articulate Holmes?  Who watched Iron Man and decided that Tony Stark would make a great Sherlock?<br />If you liked the first movie in the franchise, you may be disappointed in this one.  The commercials and the outakes shown in previews promised a good movie.  Apparently only the previews were the good parts.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|why do you need it jhust look out side if you cant look at a. the Tv if you don't. have one how are you reading this!

0374280967|5.0|Alan Bennett offers-up a very creative storyline that causes the reader to believe he has been given true insights re the cerebral life of royals. More importantly, one must conclude that human growth is a potential in all people, during all eras of life, however under utilized it may be.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Only wanted Blu-ray but wasn't available separately at time.  Gave as gift and recipient gave DVD to friend.  A win-win, two for one gift!
B0053B347M|5.0|I love these little LED strips! I have one on the back of my monitor, which partially for looks (and it does look pretty cool) but it actually functions to allow you to focus better. And then another hidden under a monitor stand to softly illuminate the desk and my keyboard. Very helpful and much better than a bright desk lamp.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Only needed Blu-ray but this combo pack was cheaper than buying just the Blu-Ray at the time.  I gave it as a gift and the recipient shared the DVD with a friend.  Two for one gift - good deal!
B00ABO573A|2.0|I didn't outright hate this film but it was FAR from me liking it. Its the constant cheating on each other and then wondering why they never work out. And the whole scene where Paul is screwing some hot young guy in bed and then calls out for Eric. What a joke!! I wanted to go in there and slap Paul upside the head. Although the hot young guy was sweet to look at.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Excellent sound but I wish it had Skyfall on it also. Gift recipient was thrilled though and that's all that matters.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|If you are the kind of person that loves to watch pride and prejudice and any other British type of movies, this is the series for you. Love to watch it!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good sequel to the hunger games but a bit confusing to follow towards the end. Will have to reread certain parts. Otherwise, a great way to introduce book 3.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game and have been playing it for about a month or so now. I read through these reviews and feel like clearing things up a bit. There is no save button, it auto saves. The lost progress and in-ability to load alies bases to get hearts was resolved in a (verry) recent update. To exit game, hit the top right button, then the arrow on bottom and hit home to the left. Yes you can use real money to buy Medals for special buildings, but you can play easily without doing so. Just like any game like it, it takes time to start. Once you reach about lvl 10, it gets a lot more fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS fun for the whole family.  We like how there are new missions with updates. I would recommend this game.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I loved everything about this movie except for Russell Crowe, who had no business at all being in it.  His acting was mediocre and his singing abysmal.  The rest of the cast, though, was amazing.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman - He did a fabulous job as Jean Valjean!  Some people have criticized his singing, but I disagree.  It had an edge to it that really played well into Valjean's character and he made the role come alive.  I think Hugh Jackman as Valjean *might* surpass Hugh Jackman as Wolverine (well, maybe not THAT far...)<br /><br />Anne Hathaway - She deserved that Oscar.  All I can say is AMAZING!!!<br /><br />Amanda Seyfried - Her acting was great and I completely respect her for getting a voice double to handle her songs.  A great decision that was best for the movie.  She was a high soprano with a voice like a bell--perfect for the role.<br /><br />Sasha Baren Cohen & Helena Bonham Carter - They did a good job at being despicable in a comic relief sort of way.  Which is too bad, really.  While they were scummy, they failed to be truly evil.  Even when Bonham Carter was threatening abuse against the child Cosette, she didn't come across as intimidating or even very dark.  Same when Baren Cohen brought a bunch of thugs to rob and possibly murder Valjean.  He just didn't pull off the darkness.  Still, they did their roles well overall.<br /><br />That-guy-who-played-Marius: Great job!  He really gave Marius a personality that I had trouble getting from the play and gave him a true place in the story.  His voice was great, and I was blown away by his performance in &#34;Empty Chairs at Empty Tables&#34;.  The direction wasn't the best, but he was at his best.<br /><br />That-gal-who-played-Eponine: AMAZING!  She really understood Eponine and all the details that made her who she was.  The way she emotionally rose and fell at each interaction with Marius was subtle, but perfect.  And when she sang On My Own, she had a moment there that just about moved me to tears.<br /><br />Colm Wilkinson (the Bishop of Digny): I was so pleased to see him in the movie.  Colm was the original Broadway Valjean and the decision to include him as Father Bienvenue, the Bishop of Digny, was beautiful.  It seemed like a little thing, but as a longtime fan of the play, it means a LOT.<br /><br />Russell Crowe: What can I say.  He should NOT have been in this movie.  He was like the aftertaste of a pill you had in your mouth for too long before swallowing.  His singing sounded like someone trying to talk while yawning and his voice and acting lacked the passion, conviction, and wholehearted devotion to the play that everyone around him seemed to have.  I wish his suicide in the movie would have been 2 hours earlier so we could be done with him.<br /><br />Regardless of his lack of singing and acting ability in the movie (don't get me wrong, I LOVE Gladiator, liked Master and Commander, and liked A Beautiful Mind) this is an absolute MUST SEE.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My granddaughter loves this game. She beats the characters and wants to play all day. She never gives me a chance to play anymore. Once she learned the game we have to tell her went to stop (she is 4).
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Suspense and surprise leap out with every episode. The acting is superb. Glen Close is a super star. I can't wait to watch each program.<br /><br />I wonder how the writers and directors consistently produce such excitement. They are true professionals.
B001E7EONC|1.0|We rented this movie for 24 hours and we watched it for about an hour before it started pausing and skipping every minute or so. It sometimes took a minute or two for it to reload before it would freeze and skip again. We are very displeased with Amazon on this rental.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|I like the information provided such as est time left, est time to charge, etc. I have the same issue that other people have reported that when it is installed the normal usb cable does not change the kindle fire.  Ended up removing it.

Good stuff!

B007WFR0QS|5.0|Once again a &#34;Brit&#34; woman astounds me with not only her&#34;pipes&#34; but the songs themselves.  She ranks right up there with Adele and Amy Winehouse, and I am eagerly waiting for her second album.
B009S33I68|5.0|I have read this book many times and now I own it.  Our soldiers got a bad rap for doing their duty. I always supported them but disliked Pres Johnson for how he conducted the war.
1476733953|5.0|I don't even know what to say, or where to begin.  I don't have words to describe how I feel about this book.  I have been an avid reader since I could hold a book (or Nook, now, haha) and I have never had a story grab me like this one did.  My interest was ENGULFED for 1100 pages!!  I finished it yesterday, and I'm just not alright with NOT having more of it to read.  I literally don't even KNOW what to possibly attempt to read after this that will even begin hold my attention.  You may be thinking, \\"oh...just another apocalyptic book...yawn\\", but there is nothing like this out there...and I've read a (quite a) few.<br /><br />I have never read a book twice.  Ever.  But I may just start again at the beginning and save myself the trouble of trying finding something else that will satisfy me, after this beauty.  Not to mention, I'll get to pick up on all of the details I missed, now that I know what's going on.  Thanks to the author for the LOW price, too.  Read it!  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />Great job, Howey.  GREAT JOB.

B00979CS50|2.0|I think all these 5 star reviews say more about Neil's fans than they say about this album. I've been listening to Young for 40 years and to me this album just proves that he has way too much studio time available. The Psychedelic Pill remix was pretty good. The other short songs were okay. I would never listen to the long songs again. Life is too short and I don't get high. Any song that runs more than 5 minutes playing the same riffs and singing the same tune is just self indulgent. Pick the best 5 minutes and cut the rest. His guitar is sounding very good but I need more than good guitar sounds. For me, more is not always better, it's just more. Take the 5 best songs from Americana and the short songs from Pill and that's a pretty good album.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|It started out alright. But it failed to work after going back to play it. Had to remove it, then reinstall it. Still failing to load. Grandsons got upset over that. Let down that it didnt work.

B005LAIHZY|5.0|This movie is a great mother/daughter tale.  Showing a mother's love and desire to protect in a way that daughters can understand.  My granddaughter loved the story and hopefully she got a little insight into what a mother (parent) does to protect their children.  Besides the &#34;lesson&#34;, it is a fun, fast-paced story with unique characters.  A lot of younger girls will identify with the heroine.

B0089XH38M|5.0|I use the paid version on my computer and have enjoyed having it on my Kindle Fire.  It's assuring to know that my Kindle Fire is covered as well as my computer.
B007MDB71O|5.0|One of my favorite movies in nearly 50 years of film-watching. Since first catching John Carter on Starz a few months ago, and then buying the Blu-ray, I have watched this movie at least a half dozen times, growing more captivated by it with each viewing. It is a great adventure, lovingly made, beautifully realized, and full of the action and romance of the pulp stories that inspired it. Based on the 1912 story by Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, who is considered the grandfather of American science fiction, directors and studios have struggled throughout the last century to bring this epic tale to the big screen. Everything from Flash Gordon, to Star Wars to Avatar was directly inspired or influenced by John Carter's escapades on Mars (or Barsoom as it's called by the natives), but it wasn't until the once science fiction setting of 2011 that computer technology finally caught up to Burroughs'  prolific imagination, making it possible to bring his amazing otherworldly cities, creatures and flying ships to vivid life.<br /><br />As breathtaking and essential to the story as the special effects are, it was Academy Award-winner Andrew Stanton's direction, and the performances of the cast (including the CGI ones) that made me fall in love with this movie. For me, the heart of the film is the impossible yet destined romance between wayward Virginia cavalryman John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) and his literal star-crossed lover, the Martian princess, scientist and swordswoman, Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). The performances of and chemistry between Kitsch and Collins are so convincing I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles. And the thousands of green-skinned, nine-foot-tall, four-armed Martian Tharks who make up most of the supporting cast are just as convincing, even though they exist entirely as digital pixels. The only thing that kept me from believing that they were real is the knowledge that they can't be, and the motion-captured performances of the major Thark actors (Willem DaFoe, Thomas Haden Church, Samantha Morton and Polly Walker) convey as much emotion and character as any of their corporeal co-stars. This also goes for Woola, the Martian doglike callot, who quickly becomes Carter's faithful best friend and protector.<br /><br />My only criticism of the movie is the five minute prologue, which I feel takes away from the wonder of Carter's initial Martian journey as it was presented by Burroughs (to rectify this, I recommend starting the movie from scene two, which is when the opening title credit appears). It was mainly for this reason that I was going to give John Carter only four stars, until I realized that the last five minutes--which I consider one of the greatest movie endings in film history--totally offsets the deficit of the awkward beginning.<br /><br />Regrettably, I missed John Carter when it was in theaters, having been unduly influenced by undeservedly negative reviews from members of the film industry press who deemed the movie a critical and financial failure--almost entirely as a result of Disney's incomprehensible and incompetent marketing decisions (such as dropping \\"of Mars\\" from the title) and false reports of skyrocketing production costs (for more on Disney's marketing debacle, read Michael D. Sellers' excellent expos&eacute;, [[ASIN:0615682316 John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood]]).<br /><br />Fortunately, John Carter has found a second life and a growing fan following through people viewing it on television, computer and tablet, who are as mystified as I am at how so many critics could fail to appreciate this movie's many charms.  Hopefully, as more and more people give this film the chance it deserves, that fan following will eventually reach a critical mass, and those of us who didn't make it last time will get a second opportunity to see Barsoom on the big screen in a John Carter sequel.actors (Willem DaFoe, Thomas Haden Church, Samantha Morton and Polly Walker) convey as much emotion and character as any of their corporeal co-stars.

B009RX85N0|5.0|Watched this show from the beginning and I'm truly obsessed!!! Every week my husband and our 2 kids will sit and watch this show we are all hooked, simply can't get enough if it!!! Haven't been into a show in years until I started watching this one!
B008D30K7E|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from the book, and the beginning seemed a bit slow, but boy am I glad I persevered!  I loved this book: it made me laugh constantly.  It's been described as a Swedish Forrest Gump which seems quite accurate.  I strongly reccommend reading it if you want a laugh and a bit of light fun!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Terrific read. I so enjoy Stephen King's writing style. Completely engrossing book with detail about the late 50's and early 60's that I never knew about -- (I was a little kid at that time!)
0425263916|3.0|I liked the first book in this series, naturally I would want to follow up with this. It was good and well written, but good golly, the characters exhausted me. I couldn't keep up with the break ups, make ups, sex in between. Granted these are hot, steamy books and the characters have depth, but too much drama for my liking.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a wonderful series!  I also loved the way in which this was shot.  It was one of the reasons I bought this set.  Me and my wife watch this one quite often.  Pop em in and enjoy!  The giant hill of bat poo is still hard to get over though...heh
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie stole my heart, and also helps people realize just how far the gay community has come since that time, Its great to know that my fiance and i do not have to be afraid to be who we are like they were so afraid to be in this movie.  Loved the passion that they had for each other in this movie.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to people who are afraid of their sexuality, and hopefully it will help them except who they are
B00AB0AXU6|3.0|Good to watch all together at once and have a marathon! Nice to see that Alice lives on! Guess we will see more since it ended like the rest.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One star for multiplayer<br />One star for being just a great game and not a scam<br />One star for being addictive<br />One star for being  up to date<br />And one star for being what minecraft was ment to be for build,destroy,and craft
B0095P33IW|5.0|Who doesnt like an American hero.  As always these movies are top notch. I would recommend this to everyone and I have watched it several times already.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|It shipped in only 3 days and is very useful for my long bus ride to Chicago and other trips. I would definitely recommend this item to someone who travels a lot and makes few stops to charge items.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|This cd is one of my favorites as she sings, &#34;We belong together&#34;.  Her voice is like an angel and she has been around for a long time.  This cd is awesome if you are a true Mariah fan then this is the cd to have.
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|Very average. Kind of boring. A love story that lacks any kind of pizazz. Best thing about it is that it does kind of mirror real life which day to day is often boring. Yawn.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|A great addition to the Boardwalk Empire fans collections out there.  Watch all in a row back to back without commercials and you have a great weekend activity!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have it on my iphone also and I get on it every day do do do do do do do do buy you will regret not downloading./
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Kirkman accomplished what he sought to do: A psychological brain scratcher. An itch that you want to hold off on scratching just to feel that tingy a little longer.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This is an excellent book. Childhood's End is the best book I have read in years. Arthur C. Clarke is one of the best science fiction writers of all time.
0802473156|5.0|This book helps to explain the different ways people feel loved.  When we speak to others in their love language they feel loved by us and when others speak to us in our love language we feel loved.  Love is what makes the world a better place to live and fills our lives with happiness.  When we understand how to really help others feel loved then we help make the world a better place to live in.  This book needs to be taught to children in our public school system when they turn 11 so that they could learn how to develop better relationships with their peers.  I recommend this book for everyone; especially to those who may be struggling in a difficult relationship.
B000PDYVVG|4.0|I feel as if I wrote this book.  Every time I turned the page there I was.  Thank you for taking me along on your journey,I have gotten to know myself along the way.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I'm not even a chapter in and I hate all the characters all ready. AND what's with the angry sun...you have been seen...this is so derivative...maybe the author calls it foreshadowing but I call it 'calling it in.' You know what? I don't care what happens to Amy. Or her husband or his sister.<br /><br />:( dags
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|good game, I recommend it to other people to try it. My kid spends his weekends playing and says its pretty good.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|When DVD got here, it was loose in the box.  The DVD popped off the center post, scratched the back a little bit.  However it played perfectly, no skips or anything so I'm stoked.  Otherwise the product was exactly as described in the ad.<br /><br />Dangit, that was an AWESOME movie.  So glad I bought it.
B009L6UDUG|5.0|Great movie, Pierce Brosnan the best James Bond since Sean Connery .so I gave five stars just because of it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love how you can adjust the settings on this addictive and fun game. Much more preference control than any other solitare game I have played.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I found this book to be entertaining. A lot of reviewers said it was to long. And maybe so, but the stories are informing and pertain to the overall theme. The author made the message got across.
0596007124|5.0|I feel that this book is a must for developers interested in understanding design patterns better. Well suited for novice level but also contains excellent reference material for veteran developers. Familiarity with Java (or similar OO language) a must; excellent for undergrads pursuing C.S. Degrees.<br /><br />Not the biggest fan of the cover, kind of creeps me out when it's sitting on my desk looking at me, but I usually leave it open for reference anyway.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft but I like to have texture pack its fun and love the voltz texture pack it is so freaking cool. I might download it if I see people are saying texture pack is in there for kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great app. there are plenty of wonderful games available. everyone should download this game and try it. would highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS!!!!!! But sadly the update for Sydney isn't working for the kindle. It says download the update but when it gets to the Appstore it doesn't have the word update anywhere.<br /><br />Please address this problem.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was really good because it was so different from the book. I never got bored while reading it. .
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My rating scale for a Blu-Ray is fairly simple. Does the Blu-Raywork? If yes, then 5 stars. In no, then 1 star. Extra DVD was a plus.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Definitely all the stars in the sky to rate this book...it made me laugh cry...cry for the sad and happy IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT DON'T EVER CHANGE
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It 's a great story with many characters with whom you instantly become attached. Don't. Just kidding. Destined to be a classic.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I received this DVD yesterday and watched it last night.  Great!  Full of action an of course good actors.  Love that Channing Tatum!
B0087EACJK|5.0|Not often a game comes along that makes me want to play all the levels.... we have a winner with this game!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ay think subway surfers is the best because you can dodge barriers and unlocking character's and boards but it's like temple run but better because you don't have to move your iPad or kindle fire so if you don't have it, GET IT!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|As I sit here wiping tears away having taken in the story of Adam Brown's life, I am both humbled and encouraged.  For way too long unashamed followers of Christ are pictured as weak and less than impactful.  Adam's life was the antithesis of both of these.  Not perfect, always in process, and never satisfied with half hearted.  This story should serve to be the backbone of all that is good in the American fighting man!  God bless those who have the courage to follow Adam's path of service to this country and to his God.  This should be a must read for every young person graduating high school both male and female.  Vision, commitment, hard work, and then reward, from both Adam and Kelley's perspective, all going against the sense of entitlement that is too often conveyed by an educational and governmental system setting them on a wrong headed path.<br /><br />This is a story that reverberates what a-political tried and true values should be.  Individual integrity seamlessly woven in to a singularly focused team approach to world class problems with a winning, albeit costly, God honoring outcome.
B007TVANDM|5.0|My Grandaughter loves these books.She has started to actually read,they have given her  that wonderment of what will happen next.Have ordered them all and pre-ordered the others can not wait.Thamks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best I love playing it some times my little sister and I have a race on are kindles
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|super adictivo. lo tengo instalado en un kindle fire y funciona al 100%. muy recomendado si cuentan con tiempo suficiente
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This has all the trademarks of Tom Clancy's style and talent for storytelling. The story was riveting as is always the case with his novels. The final chapters were somewhat thin for me but I still enjoyed the book overall.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|If you play metal and wanna warm up before a show this is your best buddy. Crunch is awesome, as if a pedal was being used. Volume control, mids, and highs also controlled by dails. Plus its so small it won't be I'm the way of your lap when seated or standing. Buy it, It's amazing. . Stay metal!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 2.5 year old daughter and my 11 month old son play this together and they both love it!  My daughter puts the puzzle pieces in place then they both 'pop' the balloons or bubbles on the screen together while they giggle.  A definite WIN for getting the kids to play together without fighting!
B006X5L6VS|1.0|Couldn't get it to work for me.  I love to stargaze, but this did not do as I had anticipated that it would do.
B00B9LNJ9I|3.0|I was a bit dissapointed.  Not alot of songs you can really sing to.  This is nothing like her first album.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I do too. For my money, Mark Lanegan is the superior vocalist and songwriter. But strictly speaking this isn't his band, he was a guest. The new songs are to my ears more reminiscent of Mark's solo work than the atmospheric, tortured quality of Staley's Mad Season.<br /><br />They're strong little songs in their own right with some particularly heart wrenching solos by McCready, I don't know that the additions improve the vision of this classic album.<br /><br />If this is your first exposure to Above, tracks 1-10 should be considered the meal, tracks 11+ dessert and coffee. And disc 2 a completely different sitting.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|Excellent as always!  The Glee cast always do a great job on their Christmas albums.  These are albums you will play for years.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|My husband just finished listening to the book and I just finished reading it this morning.  It was a great read.  We both appreciated that the main characters had some happiness, there for awhile their world was pretty dark in every aspect.  Now we both are anxiously awaiting the next Kay Scarpetta book!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|This is a great RSS feed reader. It is smooth and sleek, and I definitely love the magazine view. It syncs with your existing Google Reader account for absolutely seamless transition--seriously without you even thinking, it takes like 10 seconds to transfer over and become your new reader!<br /><br />However, it's not exactly a replacement for Google Reader; it doesn't have an analytics feature like Google Reader does, which is REALLY helpful for those of us who create our own RSS feeds from websites...so Feedly if you're listening, please add this feature!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a really good game for children to play on.<br />It has many different levels like Sydney Rome and Many more.<br />Subway surfers is a very addictive game and I would definitely recommend it to<br />People that haven't got it already xxx
0142000671|4.0|Predictable, yet still riveting and heart-wrenching. Read in one sitting, a real page turner, easy to see why it's considered a classic.
0316187216|5.0|Red Country is the newest in Joe Abercrombie's continuing series (some are calling 'The Circle of the World' series).  Since finishing his amazing 'First Law' Trilogy, Abercrombie has released 3 \\"stand alone\\" novels in this series.  The first 2 ('Best Served Cold' and 'The Heroes') could probably be read as stand alones, because they only have a handful of side characters in common with the original trilogy.  However, 'Red Country' shouldn't be read alone, and should be read as either a follow up to the First Law, OR, read in order from book 1 to 6.  The reason I say this, is because for the first time, Abercrombie brings back a main character, not just A character, but THE character from the trilogy (SPOILERS:  There's none bloodier).  I feel if you read this book by itself, you will loose the impact that this character has on the story, and the series.<br /><br />That all being said, here's my review.  This book is amazing, it has a Western theme (or Eastern if you prefer: considering the plots for most America Westerns were stolen from Japanese Samurai films), and revenge is at the heart of the story, as with most Abercromie's novels.  To me, this book was a little bit 'True Grit' mixed with the best parts of every Clint Eastwood western (notably, Pale Rider, Unforgiven, and The Outlaw Josey Wales), mixed with a gritty, violent revenge-fantasy theme that only Joe Abercrombie could pull off.  This book is excellent on its own merit, but once I fully realized the return of the bloody character, I flew through the pages and didn't want to stop.  The novel is the best of the 3 follow-ups in my opinion, because it tells a really great story, as well as having great characters and action.  The only small thing I will say, is that perhaps Abercrombie relied a little too much on his western theme, even going as far as nearly duplicating dialogue and events from the notable westerns I mentioned above.  For some, this could be considered a trait of a warmed-over novel, but for me, it only added to the amazingness of this novel, because not only was the book amazing, but its like an 'easter egg' hunt tracking down all the little western parallels.  If you like any of the Abercrombie books, its likely you will like this one as well.for me, it only added to the amazingness of this novel, because not only was the book amazing, but its like an 'easter egg' hunt tracking down all the little western parallels.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every episode was fantastic!<br />The quality of the picture and sound were terrific!<br />Would recommend this to many friends!!!<br />Can't wait for season4
B00973902K|5.0|Again, a fine download from the Cloud, no issues so far, and it brings a smile to my face every time I hear it as it reminds me of the US swim team's video of this song.  A riot!
B001UTW7QU|2.0|Due to the rating I started watching the series, but sadly only made though 2 episodes.  I did not keep my attention.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|...Growing up with you, my darling! Mellow and warm and filled with love and memory....that is what I found in this collection of stabdards...and two originals....how I wish you had discovered Diana K. sooner.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of my very favorite apps.  Love the daily scripture widget...best one I've found with very relevant scriptures every day.  Love that I can highlight, share, bookmark.  And I love the reading plans...just finished Dave Ramsey's.  I also love that I can link this to my Kindle, my phone and my computer.  My Bible is always with me.
B003TTCURU|4.0|I am so addicted to this show now. Started with Season 1 & have made my way to Season 7 now. This is my daughters fault.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|If you enjoy Downton Abbey and similar shows/movies, then you will love this book. It's a pretty good length too so I felt it was worth the price for an ebook.
B008602KQI|5.0|When assessing movies for quality, holywooders often fall way short of the top of the scale -- some however shine beyond the scale -- One movie that was way beyond the scale was The Mission staring Robert Dinero. It is not often when a movie that I expected to be limited turns out to be fantastic. One example of this was John Carpenter.<br /><br />Now, after being sure that I would not like a movie where teans are both the heros and the villans (after all, haven't we had enough of those with the likes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Power-rangers?), I watched this one with a major lack of expectations.<br /><br />This is one movie that is WAY over the Top of the Quality Movie Scale -- the story pulls you in fairly quickly, then it keeps you focused. Yes, you pick favorites and hope they get to be successful in their mission. But the story is inbedded in such politicalism and socialism that given everything that seems to be going on today feel to be a part of this story.<br /><br />The acting was supperb from all the cast, the editing did not leave anyone wondering if there would or should be a directors cut -- and the story spell was magical.<br /><br />I must say, I did not expect Amazon to provide this in their Prime Selections so that I could see it with out additional outlay of funds, but I am truely glad they did. I will probably mark this movie as one to add to my private movie collection once my finances start to improve again, until then, I will watch this one via Amazon Prime a couple more times.<br /><br />Fantastic for sure.<br />----<br />Update -- since my original viewing of this movie, I have read the book. I must be honest, I was avoiding both because of the idea of Teen on Teen violence this glamourizes -- I do understand the critics denouncement on that note. The movie was a brilliant composition, but the story does focus and glamorizes the violence which it seems we are seeing more and more of in our real life society -- Without reading the book, much of the understanding of this movie is lost -- this is actually NOT a story that glamorizes the violence, but is a cultural commentary of a society that is in fact degrading in a path leading to Tyranny -- the people are being placed into a state of growing fear to encourage us to surrender freedoms and protections that we used to stand up for. There is reason to believe there will be some kind of civil clash that could lead to the political climate as seen in this story -- So while this is a fiction - fantasy story, it is also a possibility and thus, the story does not glamorize the violence but shows a society where the violence is being used to suppress the people's freedoms.<br /><br />I still recommend the movie, but remember, by not reading the book, you are missing out on a bunch of understanding behind the story -- and the significance of various events and symbolic components. Watch the movie, then read the book, then re-watch the movie -- there will be a significant change in how you perceive the movie as a result.<br /><br />And if you have a Kindle and the Amazon Prime service, you can \\"borrow\\" the book without further cost -- it really is a value unto itself.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Flight is not just about the crash of a passenger plane and actions of it's pilot to save a lot of lives. It is really about the salvation of a human being. Give it a chance. So well done. Denzel Washington once again shows what a great actor he is. Kelly Reilly is also phenomenal. Watch it.
B004AP9W46|4.0|This book is about the Vampire Lestat but the beauty of it is the story of creation with a completely different perspective of the relationship between the devil and god.
B00631VJIC|5.0|This cd is the best cd I've bought. If you love SOA you'll love the soundtrack. It is just good ol blues and to me feel good music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I cannot imagine the reasoning behind this series having been cancelled. Everyone I have ever known who watched it, loved it. The characters are so real to you, with such interesting byplay. There is the tension of unresolved romance, the grit of a soldier, the genius of someone who is off her rocker, the integrity of a natural leader. All of this is set way off in the future, with the crew running salvage, transport, and a little illegal stuff on the side in their spaceship for whom the show is named. The crew of the firefly ship are all rebels, having lost the war for freedom, but who quietly buck the system and skirt the law. With the setting including any number of planets, some of whom live in abject poverty, scenes may be anything from future tech to wild west complete with horses and cowboys. It's got everything...humor, sorrow, frustration, the good guys striving for freedom, romance, and novel situations. Really the best TV show I have ever seen, period.
078322611X|5.0|Lost  my first one in a move and this edition has directors cuts and interviews with real base ball players . Very wholesome you dont really notice the surreal elements of the movie.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|After seeing this on my Prime account I actually purchased the movie on BluRay.  Quality was great and I recommend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fun and exciting the whole way through. It's always great to see a love story develop. I definitely recommend this novel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome!!!<br />(: just downloaded it and now I'm addicted. Lol I recommend this to everyone that loves horses or has always wanted one themselves.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Gets better and better.  Some surprises but that is for the viewer to know.  Waiting with bated breath for season 4.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really enjoy this game playing the first time I did run into some problems like needing to buy the toy store but there's was no toy store others had same problem. I also had issues with my goals not opening and not giving me any goals. This second time playing has been great so far no problems so I'm loving it!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is cute and fun. Easy enuff for  my kids but still challenging for my husband and i. Very awesome

B002PEP4SC|5.0|A lover of Castle this book was picturesque of the series I've grown to love.<br />I suggest all read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a great pass time game, keeps you wanting more. I would recommend it to others. The board would be nice if it changed more, to make it more challenging. I like. Lol
B004J09ONG|4.0|Nice to know there there is more than idiot ideology for choices for children to watch  I hate anything that relates to a colored sponge talking

006082543X|4.0|I have a confession to make. I have never read the original Coraline novel.  My 13 year old son is OBSESSED with Coraline in all its forms and has begged me to read it and I mean to, but I haven't gotten around to it.  I loved the movie and when he recently received this graphic novel as a gift to add to his Coraline collection I grabbed it up and read it before I think he even had a chance to.  I am now hooked on Coraline and I know I have to move the novel to the top of my TBR pile.  This is just a chilling, mesmerizing and beautiful story.  I got the creeps just reading this version.  The illustrations were a nice contrast from the movie version visuals I know so well.  I really was taken in by the story and the differences between it and the movie version.  I thought the illustrations were lovely and brought just the right feel to the story.  I don't know that graphic novels in general will be my thing but this one was such a fun way to spend an hour.  Neil Gaiman has such a great imagination and talent for putting a world into words.  I look forward to reading more books by him including Coraline.
1476719071|5.0|OK I have to admit one of the reasons I wanted to read this book is because of the negative reviews I read. I honestly thought that Travis would either beat up Abby or kill a guy in the ring. That's the impression from the reviews of this book. One reviewers said \\"THE most disturbing scene in a book I've ever read\\" so, of course, I had to read it! I didn't' find anything on the level of this disturbing. And, remember...the title of the book has the word DISASTER in it! It's obviously going to not be a flowery romance.<br /><br />There is one scene that is upsetting...but unlike what I had thought, Travis wasn't the cause. I understand that if some young readers read this book and they think the way Travis acts is acceptable, but if you read Abby's roommates reaction to their relationship and even Abby herself, you can see they are trying to show Travis that he is OUT of line being so possessive and violent. He tries to change. This is recognized by all and no one accepts it as ok behavior. You gotta love Travis and his ridiculous love for Abby. It's beautiful in it's own way. Of course, if my bfriend or husband acted like Travis, I'd run the other way!!!<br />Please beware..this is NOT a flowery love story (at least not until the end...very sweet, Travis can be so sweet sometimes)...it's not nearly as violent as people are making it out to be (or maybe it was built up so much I kept awaiting for something CRAZY CRAZY to happen and it never did) Has a nice ending. YES totally unrealistic, but ALL these books are!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that I am the type of reader that really likes to imagine things in my head. I sometimes reread scenes so I can play it out in my head. Sometimes in this book, I would find a character all of the sudden show up out of nowhere talking and it took me out of the moment. Or when you think they talking face to face and then all of the sudden he was behind her back. Otherwise it was really well written, I loved everyone in the book...I wish it were a series or trilogy...didn't want to say goodbye so soon. Really looking forward to reading Walking Disaster!
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|The first episode was a flurry of story lines from previous seasons and adding more sub-plots for me to trace.  A little disconcerting.<br />But it all comes together well throughout the season.<br />For Downton junkies, it's hard to wait even a day to move on to the next episode.<br />Thanks for making it available at a reasonable cost
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Downloaded this game the other day and I found myself staying on it as much as possible. You have waves of zombies coming to destroy your gate and you can summon your own allies to help you out. It gets harder as you go.  I haven't gotten to a part where I have o pay t poo advance in the game. So try it out
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Season 3 was as good as the previous seasons.  It pulled at the heart strings much more though.  The character development was pretty good.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|a good game and you don't have to be really skilled to play it.  I like that when you run out of hearts, you just put it away for half and hour and you are ready to go again...you don't have to keep buying hearts so you can play.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|In an age of increasing complexity in IT, I absolutely loved how this book tied up all that complexity into a coherent system linked to business outcomes. In all fairness, this linkage is described at a very high level, but it certainly enables a curious reader to see the whole picture and go after specifics.<br />As a security professional, I appreciate the accuracy of how some of our views might be misguided and how this can be corrected.<br />The smart IT professional will read this book at least a couple of times, first as curious fiction, then as a guidebook for professional growth.

B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This is a great and very approachable story that illustrates how IT integrates deeply w all aspects of a modern business and how improvements in IT process can free a business and help make it into a very agile player that is able to react quickly and successfully to whatever the market throws at it. This is a must read for employees in every corner of a company.
1476712042|3.0|I wanted to read a romantic novel, and this is just that....a story about an extremely complicated college-age couple consisting of a mysterious girl running from her past and a tattoo-clad bad boy who participates in underground fighting; with a heart-warming (personally I thought cringe worthy) ending. Well-written though sometimes the plot lines are a little far fetched and ridiculous (He broke out into song...? really?)<br /><br />Maybe I'm unqualified to comment on this because I went to a large university, but the whole we-have-lunch-in-a-cafeteria-with-everyone-watching is very high school-esque. This is college. People eat lunch at different times, and in different places with different people........<br /><br />Also, was I the only one who thought Travis was absolutely insane? I get the whole bad-boy thing, but his violent reactions were intensive therapy worthy. America was awesome though.

0439023521|5.0|***SPOILER ALERT***<br />The following book review contains spoilers.<br /><br />Introduction<br />This review is mainly for those few of you who have neither read the book nor seen the popular movie and don't mind a few spoilers. The Hunger Games is a traditional hero story with a young heroine Katniss Everdeen. The political environment in the future United States is a harsh dictatorship ruled by an elite district who leeches off of the other 12 districts by consuming their resources and living in utter luxury. They rule with an iron fist. They use tactics such as intimidation, execution, extensive monitoring, and heavy handed punishments for dissenters. While the government (located at the Capitol Panem) seems to have a strong grasp on the political landscape, in reality, their hold in tenuous at best. There is a rising undercurrent of discontent. As in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, the capitol is entirely dependent on the outlying districts for all their natural resources.  Like the school bully who steals the weaker kid's lunch money, Panem bullies the other districts into submission.<br /><br />The biggest way that Panem keeps the districts under control is by the use of a gladiatorial  contest called the Hunger Games.  The parallel with ancient Rome is a little too obvious. The difference being that the arena is not in some Coliseum, but is shifted from place to place. Its purpose is psychological intimidation. The bully tries to remind the bullied how weak they really are. But, what happens when the bullied get sick and tired of the situation? What President Snow really fears is that the districts will somehow gain a sense of hope; that some underdog will show up the Capitol and embarrass them.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins Interview<br />This is exactly how Katniss Everdeen functions in this story. She is thrust into the spotlight by the Hunger Games. She survives; she actually wins the Hunger Games. Somehow they (She and Peeta) are allowed to share the title. There is supposed to be only one winner among the 24 tributes. By them both threatening suicide, they call the bluff of the Capitol and manipulate themselves into the winners circle.<br /><br />Though they are winners, they really don't possess freedom anymore. They function as the ultimate propaganda machine. The state uses the winners to train other tributes. The ultimate victims become the victimizers. It reinforces the control that the capitol has over the districts.<br /><br />Book Recommendation<br /><br />The intended audience of this series is young adult readers. It seems to be on about an 8th grade reading level. I think the book could have been more sophisticated in its plot structure. Also, the story is told in the first person with Katniss as the narrator. While this works in much of the book, it does get tiresome at times to only see things from her perspective. I think that if the story had been in the third person with flashes of omniscience for significant characters; this would have added to the richness of the story.<br /><br />The book is fast paced and is remarkable in that it builds tension quite well. The dialog is well done and realistic. I thought that Katniss seemed a little too resilient as a character. She seems to go right along with the games. Then again, Katniss is a survivor. She will do whatever it takes to stay alive. She does a great job of pretending; putting on a fake smile where needed; going along with the suggestions of her trainer, Haymitch.<br /><br />One of the strongest character traits of Katniss is her compassion for the weak. She cares deeply about others. For example, in the arena, she tries to help Rue, a young 12-year old tribute from District 11. She mourns Rue's loss.<br /><br />I think Collins does a superb job of portraying the trauma of the games. This is a life and death struggle involving kids from 12 to 18 years old. It's hard to stomach and makes the reader feel the trauma of what it's like to live under a repressive regime.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this book to any young reader. If you are a parent, you will have to use your own judgment as far as how young, but the worst thing is probably the violence in the book. All in all, this is an excellent series. Suzanne Collins has done a superb job in creating a world that engrosses the reader. Perhaps its lack of complexity in both plot and structure is well suited to its intended young adult audience. With that being said, I think all readers will find the story very enjoyable.r a repressive regime.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this book to any young reader.

076421120X|5.0|I was most familiar with Darlene Zschech as a recording artist, and love her music.  So I was quite fascinated with her daily devotional book.  She has poured her heart and soul into this book.<br /><br />It is set up in a traditional devotional format, with a verse or verses at the top of the page, then her thoughts as the body of the reading, and a prayer or response at the bottom.  It is a single page per day, so not a huge time committment in reading, but her words are quite thought-provoking and can linger for most of the day.  She uses song lyrics to open each month, and there are subtle graphics throughout the book.<br /><br />This devotional would be good for either a man or woman (some devotionals tend to appear very feminine) and the book is beautifully bound, so would make a nice gift.  This time of year I think of Mother's Day or graduation.  There is a companion CD that has the recordings of the songs that open each month, which would be a great way to meditate even more on the scripture passages of each day.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  I received this book from Bethany House Publishers.  All opinions expressed are my own.
0609610570|5.0|Excelent description of what it takes to create an organization that consistently gets things done and done well - a must for implementation of strategy. Can help an individual improve performance, but is really an explaination of how a well run organization should operate; so if you organization does not meet the requirements, you can work to change it or find a better organization (depending on your influence within your organization).  Liked it so much, bought multiple copies to give to coworkers.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I fell in love with this series years ago and was excited to find a place to watch it again
1455869910|4.0|TFiOS is an attractive book; it's sleek and sexy, with characters who speak with both humor and sadness.<br />My critique would be that the author uncovers many threads but doesn't seem to be interested in following through. There are so many side stories going on that we as the readers are never fully invested in.<br />Also, I thought Kaitlyn was a really irritating character. What was she implying at the end, that maybe Gus didn't love Hazel enough to leave something behind for her, or that he was secretly having an affair? I didn't get it.<br />Many times characters seemed like caricatures, not real people. But considering the whole premise of the novel, I suppose it works.<br />Also, I think Green doesn't understand girls. Hazel gives these nihilistic, existentialist, logical philosophies but then goes, \\"he is so hot.\\" Mr. Green, I don't think girls work that way. While we're at it, why did Hazel think V for Vendetta was a boys movie? That movie is amazing no matter what sex you are. It's political and deals with oppression and authority, NOT a boys movie at all. I thought Hazel would have appreciated it.<br />I did love the book, but in retrospect there is a lot to be said for some of the character development and plot. Interesting, but anyone who thinks it's the Bible needs to re-prioritize their bookshelves. Not the best thing since sliced bread, but okay.

B00AIBZM40|3.0|\\"In order to survive such extreme isolation the girls created an imaginary guardian, a parent figure to feed them, sing to them, protect them. They called her mama.\\" After the stock market takes a down turn the father of two young girls panics and begins to drive off with them. After an accident leads them to a cabin he is about to do the unthinkable when something grabs him. Five years later the girls living with their uncle and aunt begin to see their \\"mama\\" again. I will start by saying that this movie is creepy but not full on scary. Anyone who has seen the other Del Torro movies will recognize his style. This movie is scary in the way that Pan's Labrynth was. I do have to say that the movie was also a little depressing which made the creepy parts that much more effective since it's playing with your emotions. The movie is good and worth watching but it is PG-13 so don't expect a jump out of your seat horror. Overall, good movie worth seeing but also a little depressing as well as creepy. I give it a B

Then I started reading the Infernal Devices which I also loved. I have just recently read the last book, the Clockwork Princess. While I was reading these books, there were times when I felt joy and despair. There were times when I smiled and when I cried. There were also times when I literally jumped up in the air. I'm a hardcore fantasy reader so I loved the story. I loved all of the characters. I loved how rich detailed Cassandra Clare had made these books. I'm very excited to see the movie, me and my friends will be seeing it together the day it comes out with mortal instruments t-shirts on us (we did it when we went to see the hunger games, so we're doing it with this one too) :) I would like to thank Cassandra Clare for writing one of the best stories the world has ever seen...  I just want her to know that I'm so thankful to her for adding another life and, another world into mine... Jace, Clary, Simon, Alec, Isabelle, Magnus, Tessa, James, William, Cecily, Gabriel, Gideon, Sophie and the others... They are all a part of my soul now, and for that I am grateful...
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I'd read a bit about this and seen some of the press on it before buying the movie. I thought my twenty-something son would probably enjoy it more than I, but we both loved it equally. The true story of songwriter/musician/performer Rodriguez, with his initial fleeting popularity in the U.S., while simultaneously becoming a visionary light to so many in South Africa, is truly inspiring.<br /><br />But - POOF! - this great talent seemingly disappeared into thin air. Were the rumors true? Was he really dead? The story of the search for Rodriguez is impressive, a never-say-die endeavor by some very dedicated people. Buy the movie, see the story as it unfolds and learn the truth for yourself ... you won't be disappointed. Enjoy the wonderful music along the way, too!

B005JE1JZC|5.0|Well developed story with believable characters, and great insight into human nature.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book, better than the Assassin series, but not by much.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a long tale filled with sadness and weeping, battles and betrayal, love and envy. If you have loved the TV Series and love a good story you simply MUST try the novels. There is nothing quite like them. In a way they are Grand Adventures like Lord of The Rings where the plot drives the story. Yet this has engaging characters that you cannot help but fall in love with, hate beyond belief and worship from afar.<br /><br />5-Stars, well earned!

1609611543|5.0|I had never heard of this book until I recently visited with friends, who both had lost 15 lbs over 6 months.  As an engineer, what I like about the book is breadth & depth of his explanations and the examples.  While I understand not everyone agrees with his conclusions, I appreciate his attempt to be specific and scientific.  To me, his explanations makes it more plausible than other &#34;diet&#34; books.  Finally, I do not view this as a &#34;diet&#34; book, but more of a lifestyle change book.  I was a sworn pasta & bread lover and in just 5 weeks, I have seen positive benefits in no more afternoon crashes and my flatulence &#34;issue&#34; has all but been resolved.  And I have lost 6 lbs.  My wife has also noticed her acid reflux has almost completely diminished.

B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Billed as a example of Hendrix's more experimental & less rock orientated music, but apart from the \\"Let there be love\\" & \\"Mojo Man\\" which have a soul feel to them, & Hendrix not doing the vocals, this album is pretty similar to the previous 11 albums in this series.<br />Not to say it isn't utterly fascinating to listen too (it's always interesting to look under the bonnet of Hendrix's creative process), seeing how songs like \\"Izabella\\" & \\"Hear my train a comin\\" evolve & change.<br />You also have four tracks that are instrumental, which really magnifies the quality of the musicianship, from all players.<br />According to the Hendrix Family, this should be the last of this type of album, & I certainly hope it is, finishing on such a high mark.
B00992CF6W|1.0|This game everyone says it's soooo fun but that price, wow. $6.99 for a game. that os just way to much money for a game that might get deleted later on so why waste seven dollars on a app.

Another thing I love about this game is that you can connect to Facebook(optional) to compete for.high scores. This game is really fun and I have gotten a lot of my friends to play it. Ps. They ALL love it and I would suggest it to anyone who asked me about  it.
0142419400|4.0|After hearing nothing but great/amazing things about this novel I knew that I wanted to read it. It sounded like it would be a mix of Perfect Chemistry with some of Sarah Dessen's classic contemporary writing in there as well. Naturally I was super excited to start this one because I love Perfect Chemistry, and anything Dessen writes. Sad to say I just wasn't in love with this book, I thought it was great but there was one thing that kept me from flat out being in love with this book. Let me explain...<br /><br />Anna starts off as this great, somewhat shy character living in a place she has never been before. Of course she meets a great guy named St. Clair, who is a top pick for any girl to swoon over. I did love the begininng of the story, watching as these two became friends and teasing each other. Yet I knew just like Anna did that St. Clair was already taken by a girl that the reader will never see much of for the entire length of the novel. So see people I did love the beginning, in the middle towards the end of the novel is where I had a small issue.<br /><br />The issue was that while Anna started off as a great character, over time she got more and more dramatic. I understand she is going through a lot in the book and she is a teenager so some drama is perfectly fine. However, I felt that at certain points Anna acted like everything was the end of the world, such as the Toph thing. Anna simply started to annoy me in the middle of the book and towards the end for being too dramatic. Maybe this is a teenage thing that I've simply outgrown but I just felt Anna went in a complete opposite direction than where her character started. I became sad for how her character went slowly downhill, from a girl that every girl could look up to, to one that was falling apart. Anna also got on my nerves every single time she started to say St. Clair is so perfect, no one is perfect! I love St. Clair's character but we don't need the overexaggeration all the time.<br /><br />Overall, I really had such high hopes for this book but Anna's character started to annoy me as time went on. I did like the setting of the story, Paris was a perfect place to learn about. I loved St. Clair, he was not perfect by any means, he had his flaws, and I think those made his character strong instead of weaker. I also did like the secondary characters and the overall direction of the plot. I enjoyed watching Anna and St. Clair fall in love and I did rather enjoy the ending of this book. Overall this one gets 4.5 hearts because it was a great book just that one thing with Anna kept me from flat out loving the story. Can't wait to read Lola's story in the companion novel.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I generally like coming of age stories and resisted this one because it had been made into what looked like a terrible movie. And I didn't like title.<br /><br />I am very glad I gave this book a try, mostly due to the high ratings on amazon. Charlie is a sensitive, lost and loving boy who doesn't really know where he fits in, and who takes pleasure in even a kind look from a stranger. But the beauty of the book, and the beauty of Charlie is that while you feel for him, his character is not pathetic. He feels things and it's okay. He's not popular and it's okay. He doesn't pretend to be someone he's not, even if that means not-quite fitting in.<br /><br />Charlie almost felt like a modern day, suburban Holden Caufield, and this book made me realize how lacking modern-day books are of sensitive, feeling young boys. It was nice to finally meet one again.

I was sick of how perfect this guy is (except for his obvious kinks) after about the hundredth time &#34;Anastasia&#34; told me.  The fact that they're f---ing every other page also, to my surprise, got old real quick - and perfectly done every time - what a man!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I'm a App-aholic and I go through apps like nobody's business. Thinking I must have left a pile of &#34;garbage&#34; in the recesses of my Kindle Fire, I downloaded Clean Master and ran it. Wow... there was a lot of junk on the flash drive! After cleaning and restarting, my Kindle Fire burns brightly once again!<br /><br />Recommended for App-aholics and for those who like a clean Kindle Fire.
B00B52F278|5.0|Been watching this season and I am blown away. Although my favorites were the Gods of the Arena and Blood and Sand, this season is just an emotionally charged roller coaster ride. Too bad it's ending (but on a high note) and I wish this show had more exposure to keep it going for many more seasons. People should not miss this series, especially the first season with Andy Whitfield who had to leave the show to battle cancer and to ultimately lose to it. Such young talent robbed of a bright future.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I read all the Mars books as a young kid, and Teen. This movie was better than the book! I wish it was longer, I hope to see a series of John Carter on Barsoom movies. This is excellent.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|There are a few very melodramatic plot twists and resolutions, but the top-notch acting and production quality make up for it.
0785139168|4.0|Considering that adapting the book took nearly 6 hours in the 1995 mini-series, I'm impressed at how much of the original material was included in this graphic novel. It's a perfect primer for any teenager to be introduced to a classic book.<br /><br />The reason this isn't 5 stars is because I had a difficult time telling the Bennet sisters apart. They looked too much alike. Beyond that, however, the artwork was quite stellar and I appreciated the small details like the outfits.
B00005N5RM|5.0|This movie was a flashback to goodtimes and was done in good order.Quality special effects, great cast of characters and a must see for the sci-fi lovers.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I wish I could give this game negative stars. Gameloft desserves it. Seriously stay away from this game, they will happily take your money and leave you in the dust in return. They have abandoned kindle users, no updates, no customer service, just a crashing app and a giant middle finger to loyal users.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it and so does the rest of my family. It's the greatest kid friendly app I've ever used.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|We loved the series and after watching the first season and raving about it to my mom we bought it for her.  She watched the second season but not the first.  It filled in all the blanks for her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it I play it all day and night. You need this game trust me or not ya don't
0801896940|1.0|This book was basically written for physics students who knows very little mathematics. If you were a beginner physics student who has studied up to Hamiltonian mechanics and is not familiar with much mathematics, this book would work (although very ineffective ). If you know group theory or lie algebra, this book would be such a waist of time. It derives Noether't theorem in a very messy and ugly way taking so much time, where Noether's theorem can be derived much more beautifully elegantly and simply from Lie groups. If you want to properly understand Noether's theorem, study Lie groups instead and you shouldn't waist your time on this book.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It came as no surprise to me that MacLaine was such an absent, cold parent because she has never made it a secret that she wasn't going to give up her career for anyone. Sachi did a great job of outlining her years in Japan and how she identified herself as Japanese due to her parents insistence that she do just that. It was a book that was hard to put down as Sachi shared numerous accounts of her resilience in the face of absent parents, both emotionally and physically. She should be applauded for her perseverance. It's an easy read.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|It was wonderful when I read it 60 yrs ago, and it is still amazing.I have been rereading many classics and they will stay classics. No matter the readers' age
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ADULT: I gave temple run a try and found it difficult to get very far. This is more my speed and I'm probably in better shape now to give TR another try. I got a little obsessed with this initially but after a few days it wore off. After a few upgrades the next levels take an absurd amount of coins. I average 500 coins per run. It takes 50 to 100 runs to get near the next upgrade. Which takes more than an hour. I have a life. So unless you have a hacked phone you will burn out fast.  If you liked Temple Run you will like this for a little while.<br /><br />  10 YEAR OLD:  I think its so much fun to jump around get boost and collect coins! I think if I were you I would down loud this game and all the back rounds and go unlock some new things! Have a good time and I hope you like it!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have read all of Cornwell's books and I was disappointed in this one.  It moved slow, at times boring. Kay's actions and thoughts were not in character. Not the Kay we all love and admire.<br />I would not recommend this one.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|Sadness and hopelessness beyond compare.  How a government can extinguish a race of people by turning the populace against them through propaganda, lies, and blame for their current condition.  Then to think that this has occurred in my lifetime is almost beyond belief.  Excellent movie for the realism of how horrible people can treat other people because of ideology.
1452110581|4.0|Some of the jokes in here seem a little forced, but overall it's an amusing thing to look at, especially if you have cats. I purchased this a sort of joke gift for my sister, who will probably find this more entertaining than I do.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|It was a pretty good book.  A semi familiar plot line, boys grouped together and being trained to fight for the &#34;faith&#34; But the main character is well drawn and you remain interested in how he gets through each event in his life.  It also didn't really cliff hang, which I like.  I hate having to wait forever for the next book and it seems authors in general are taking longer and longer in getting the next one out.  It does leave a few unanswered questions so that you want to read the next in the series without driving you crazy.  Glad I purchased it, it's nice to find new authors!
1616550414|4.0|I love Legend of Zelda, so I got this when it came out.  The artwork is gorgeous, and the timeline is also a great thing that was included.  However, I do wish that they had spent less time on Skyward Sword, and focused more on the history of Hyrule.  As I'm certain many people have already said, the title is a bit misleading in that respect. Still, something that's worth having if you're a LoZ fan!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Watched this from the very beginning, it's one of my favorite shows; although the story line has taken an interesting turn, it always returns to issues of redemption and family loyalty. And the exploration of love and choice/ethics/truth is compelling. Combined with the weird and goofy... hard not to watch.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Very good episode  but ending needed a little work.I recommend season 3 to all fans of the walking dead.Watch it.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|The package arrived on time and in the new packaging as described.  I will be using it very soon on my next trip.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have MS and do not sleep well at all. Since purchasing this AP I have had plenty of restful nights. It has been very welcoming and a long time coming. Thanks for creating and offering it to us.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics - A pretty good game! Although the gems are annoying... I'd rather have the consistent use of coins throughout the game.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|The music, the acting, and the cinematography were all exceptional. And the story-line is amazing. Humanity at it's worst and it's very best. Very well cast.<br />I saw it in the theater three times, and the HD resolution on my Kindle FIre HD is even better than what I saw in the theater. This is a classic that I'll be watching over and over.<br />Love it!!!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|this is the first movie i ever bought that has a alternate track containing clean content. even though it has both clean and explicit versions of this movie, i basically play the clean version. this movie was 'BORN' 10 years ago in the spring of 2007, meaning that filming began. now that were in the year 2017, this film turned 10 this past spring. it took over 2 years to make the film before finally being released  in december, 2009. it was a big hit. however, i realized from the story this is a outer space version of the true life tale, 'THE BATTLE OF THE LITTLE BIG HORN'. that's where james cameron got this story in the movie from. just like how the true life tale told in the 1800's, greedy thieves find a rich mineral on a planet but find that it is inhabited by a race of people who have lived there for years. so they try to get them off their own land and if they refused, they'll kill em. as much as this was a good film, why did james cameron choose a true life tale and turn it into a science fiction version?
B007OWRBJK|3.0|A decent enough read. I would have liked a little more details on the songs and albums. Especially the later Who work (who are you, face dances, it's hard).
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Plainly and simply, the whole series suffers from obvious lack of editing.  The pace of the plot is unfortunately too compelling to quit reading, but everything else about it was frustrating and agonizing to read.  I wish anyone had bothered to edit it before it was published.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The Downton Abbey series tell a fascinating story of a great house and the history of the people both &#34;above and below stairs&#34;.<br />Well written and with a wonderful cast. Yes, of course Maggie Smith is as marvellous as ever, but so are the remainder of the cast.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|If you've liked any of Malcolm Gladwell's other books, you will probably like this one as well.  It's the same, but different.  Same formatting, same pacing, same kind of examples, but obviously the examples themselves are different.  I thoroughly enjoy them all.  I would recommend them to anyone who likes to learn and absorb factoids for future retrieval.  This book is full of 'em.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I love this movie and Firefly. Brown Coats for life! Also Nathan Fillion is a baws, automatically one of the best buys I've ever done in my life.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The book is clear and simple.  Super peppy and optimistic.  She seems like a genuinely kind, good person who was put through an incredible ordeal.  Other interviews I've seen with her give the same impression.  It's unbelievable that some people have the strength to stay happy and thankful through their horrible lives, but Jaycee is clearly one of those individuals.  It's hard to doubt her sincerity, and that's refreshing.  Men, take note: It's the kind of story you'd see on the Lifetime channel.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The whole series suffers from obvious lack of editing.  The pace of the plot is unfortunately too compelling to quit reading, but everything else about it was frustrating and agonizing to read.  I wish anyone had bothered to edit it before it was published.  However I did go on to continue reading the third book.  Nothing improved.
1608871452|5.0|you cant beat these too . on supernatural, funny as hell.and they have a strong sence of familey. this book is great
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I have always wanted to go on a long walk by myself, but as a woman, I had so many fears and doubts about being able to do something like that alone safely.  While it is good to keep in mind that the world was a lot different in the 90s, it's also refreshing and inspiring to hear a story like this, and to know that someone with your problems or worse problems, with your inexperience, and with your determination can still be impressive and strong and make a mark on themselves and their world.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I liked it. I've read the rest of the series and I enjoyed this book as much as I liked the rest of the books. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I would have liked to have known who took the towel. I don't know why, bit I would have since we're probably not going to figure it out in the next book. I thought the part with Manny's  fake friends was really funny too.
0375703764|4.0|This book is an enticingly dark and curious ride.  A break from the bounds of reality, physics, and a return to human nature--filled with curiosity and violence.  Due to its composition, there was a lot of sections that I skimmed.  I'm happy I did, I don't think I would have gotten more out of the experience by reading every word (or at least every legible one).  Don't expect it to be a cohesive fiction novel, but recommended if you like other titles like The Ice at the Bottom of the World by Mark Richard.
1608871452|5.0|The book is packed with beautiful photos, behind the scenes tidbits, character & actor profiles and a lot more fascinating information that will be appreciated by the dedicated SPN fan. Definitely worth the price.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Keep your interest.  Liked the difference in time, back and forth.  Could have moved a bit fast earl. Liked the characters.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|creative, fun, SUPERB<br />this one stays in my cd player pretty much all the time!!!  The honesty and simplicity behind this group is great.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Goodwin's book is a tour de force of a remarkable time in American history. Too bad that we don't have more politicians that can manage what Lincoln did.
1451696191|4.0|creative, witty<br />wonderful<br />I love the journal entries and the emotions with these characters<br />this is a fantastic book!!!<br />I'm actually afraid to see the movie because I don't want it to be ruined.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Argo proved to be a thrilling movie about an event I remember very well.<br />Although the viewer is aware of the ending, the viewer is sitting on the<br />edge of his or her seat throughout the movie. Well done!
1439153663|4.0|This is a story from late 1700s/early 1800s America with a unique point of view, and does a fantastic job of transporting you back to this time. It is a quick read, keeping you on the edge of your seat the entire time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Really hooked on this show, can't wait for reruns.  Now it's at my disposal whenever I want, a great way to spend a ràiny afternoon.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Pixar makes the greatest animated movies, don't they?  This is one of my favorites, along with Wall-E and Toy Story
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Does just what I expected it to do.  The cord is shorter than I thought it would be (I'm sure I didn't read the listing correctly), but - in the long run - the length turns out to be just right.  Extremely helpful seller.  Fast shipping.
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|Runs great. Easy install. Glad I switched from AMD after all this time. Paired with the Intel BOXDZ77RE-75K motherboard, this chip rules.
B000SSV8HI|5.0|What a deal I got! Paid $ 3 for a $ 30 brand new 4 disc live set- hours and hours of live stuff,  rarities, hits, new songs, documentaries,  extras, and lots of cool stuff for the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band! Thank you so much!
B000ICXQXI|3.0|It was ok.  Hitchcock is a master of suspense but the film doesn't hold up today.  It moves kind of slow and the editing was weak.  The classic shower scene was fake even by 1960 movie-making standards.  All in all, though, it was still fun to watch the original over again.
B00136JQMI|5.0|I was told this was one of the greatest jazz albums ever, and it definitely lived up to that billing. Easily 5 stars.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|THE MUSIC SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THE SETTINGS ARE LOVELY, AND THE CHILDREN (AND I) LOVE THE COSTUMES. A GOOD INTERPRETATION OF THE PLAY.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|My favorite is The Garden.  That is RUSH at its best in all aspects, both musically and in lyrics. That solo is amazingly sweet.  A must have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg best game ever. They change countries it's something different every month. The graphics are great. No complaints here. My daughter plays it 24 7. She's made it here life.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|We hadn't heard of Gone Baby Gone previously (not a well known show, I guess), but we really liked it!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|These tools are great for working on equipment with small screws.  The kit comes with additional versatile tools to make it easier to get into tight spaces.  A++
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love the fact that you can keep several different notebooks going at a time. I can imagine the uses for high school students to keep notes on each subject separately. I am using mine as one notebook for spontaneously writing poems or songs, another for Sunday church notes, and still another for TO DO Lists. This app allows for customized covers, but also the color of the paper inside, whether or not it has lines and font choices. I use it much more than I thought I would. Good Job!
B001BANK32|5.0|Been a fan of the film all my life. After reading this,I find the book so much better. Deeper,darker,more terrifying.
B00ATBP6PE|5.0|I loved the movie so much I watched it twice, to show my daughter, who also enjoyed it. In the Post Civil War south, Richard Gere  and Jodi Foster give a compelling portrayal of mistaken identity, post slavery life in the South, and a love story about personal integrity. i love it.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|An amazing movie. An absolute must see. I bought this movie because i love it so much, i have watched it mutiple times.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very nice graphics and gameplay. For an app very intricate and well done. Has goals and other features that make it an app you can always play
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is addictive and fun. Different approach as the space element introduces gravity, making it a very interesting challenge.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really enjoyed the graphics and the design of this match 3 game.  I'm going to get the second one now that I have finished this one.
B007EECSFA|5.0|It is a wonderful book with an amazing story!  Kate Morton wove a tale using great characters .  Once I got into the book, I did not want to put it down.
6304498969|1.0|I was very disappointed, this DVD could not be played in the US and I would still like to get a copy of it.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|I had a &#34;Master&#34; CD (gold) of this release long ago. It was stolen when my car was broken in to but the remastered release is just as good, if not better than that.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I love all the Twilight soundtracks . I have all of them . This is one of my favorites . I listen to tis  all the time ,and I would tell anyone its got some of the best love songs ever on here . Great for a wedding .
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It was the right price - free so what's not to like.  I do wish the tiles were a little larger and you could remove the timing aspect.
0425263916|5.0|A must read . Its so good . Now I'm waiting on book three to come out . Omg  it don't come out till June .
B0063IH60K|4.0|I alternate back and forth between Free Cell and Solitaire.  Easy to play and takes your mind off daily chores for awhile.
0425263908|5.0|This is so good . If you like or loved 50 shades of gray you will love this book . Its a three part so get ready to wait till june for the next one .
B000WAXH2Q|5.0|Diana is a true musician with a sultry voice that melds with jazz background.  Love all of her albums.  WOW!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This has to be one of the best books ever. Honey if this don't get your fire burning you are dead .
B00097E4AG|5.0|Great track option if you have the big train set. Allows you to build 2 other track options verses the standard oval.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|getting better and better . I love it . I some times forget that Anna and Chris are not real .
B004P8JPS6|3.0|This is a prequel to all of his other novels.  I've read every one of them.  I love Jack Reacher and Lee Child for creating him, but this book was super slow and took some weird turns that just didn't seem to make much sense.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really fun! I love it! And it never crashes on me! It takes up little space! It is super fun and addictive
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the series on sale for $5 and it was worth much more.  Very good series.  Hope the movies are as good.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I realize that we have heroes and villains but a little bit of depth and dimension in character development makes for so much better reading
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I started reading this book as a skeptic and finished the last page with a renewed outlook on what happens when we pass on.  I work for Hospice and the thought of Heaven always makes visiting the terminally ill patients easier to bear.  Now, as I enter the home of someone to comfort them as they wait to exit this life I have more smiles because I believe Dr. Alexander.  What awaits us is the truest form of love and beauty!
B009J2VQSK|2.0|Not as good as I thought it would be. The ending song as movie credits roll was not even on the soundtrack. There are only a couple of really good songs on the CD. I was disappointed.

B00A0ABQLM|4.0|If you are going to use this with the Surface Pro, be sure to download the latest driver first before connecting it.  Otherwise the DNS will not work correctly and you will go through an ordeal trying to get it to work.  On another note, their technical support is very lacking so you will be on your own trying to figure it out.<br /><br />Ken
B007RTAR64|5.0|Beautiful! A perfect gift for someone who loves Barbie Dolls. Hope Mattel will continue to produces more dolls like this.
B00C1BTWV4|4.0|ordered 3D,that will be even better,cannt wait for it to get here,all my kids are looking to see it in 3D now
B00006JSS8|4.0|I never did have a Stevie Wonder CD, I know that sounds bad, but this was my first whole CD of just Stevie Wonder. Although only being a single disc set I know it doesn't have all. His bigger hits but it is a good starter. I'm happy. Also it was less money to get the auto rip plus the CD then just get the mp3 version.<br /> ThAnks Amazon you make it too easy.
B008J05EL8|3.0|I'm not sure I needed this, but my device thought I did. So far, I  haven't  encountered  any  problems  but  haven't  used  it a  lot.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Awesome show...so suspenseful!  Who would have thought we would be so thrilled to &#34;live&#34; in that time?!  Looking forward to season 3
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Poor video quality. I couldn't finish the movie it got so awful. I tested Netflix a minute later to test test quality and it works fine with no video/audio interruptions. Amazon Prime has more movie I want to view, but the video/audio inconsistencies cause me not to recommend Amazon Prime right now. Poor remote control functionality also.
B00B2G4O2G|3.0|The show started off really strong, but then it just became predictable. The main characters find themselves in life or death situations, but you know they will live. They constantly make dumb decisions, and the bad guy always wins. Most incompetent group of police/FBI/etc. that you will see on TV. The most recent episode \\"Whips and Regrets\\" was a little better, but just hoping to get the season over with and if it does get better, get onto the next season. If it is more of the same, it will just be a labor to finish this season then I won't watch season 2.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I found this book to be long winded and both far fetched and predictable.<br />It dragged on and on and the ending was dreadful. Give your readers a bit more substance.
B00005JM02|5.0|One of my favorite cartoon movies ever. i was happy when i got it in the mail. Love it much
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great Book! I LOVE IT! Wonder is really a wonder. A nice wonder!<br />Very inspiring!<br />Perfect for people with low confidence!
1616550414|5.0|Love it, Love, it Love it. I love the artwork, the information (its all neatly arrange) if you a Zelda fan this is a must for you Zelda collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best it lets you upgrade for FREE! You always get new limited additions including people and boards.subway surfers always base something new e.g. a new country to play in,something different to collect in a run.if there is a serious<br />Special season then there will be a new theme like in the Easter holiday you have to try and get one hundred Easter eggs in a certain amount of days and now in Sydney you collect keys to start you in the same place again if you loose. This amazing running game is the best.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you love animals, especially dogs, you'll love this movie. It pulls on the \\"heartstrings\\" hard. A real gem, based on a true story.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Best experience and mind working exercise I found in a long time. I would highly recommend every game player give it a try.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is Good app<br />But could use some work. Like the gems and having to train to do the competition's
B000JMKNVK|5.0|The interaction between Patrick Kenzie and his girlfriend is priceless and the action is always fun to follow and become a part of.  Lehane has a way of communicating with the reader that is rare!
B00AEFY6ZQ|3.0|A word of caution regarding this version. Amazon's web description says it has a 5.1 audio soundtrack. It doesn't. It's the same digital mono as earlier releases. The video is quality is good though.
0446554995|3.0|I need to make it clear that I am one of the quintessential fans of Preston and Child.  I not only read everything they write--I have read some of their books several times.  I say this to explain that it is painful for me to write this review.  But, I also want to say that I don't lay the blame for it at the feet of the authors alone.  From the beginning, fans of these talented gentlemen have clamored for more and more information about the characters, especially Pendergast.  This is the third in a trilogy in which the authors gave in to the pleas and it was a grave mistake (no pun intended).<br /><br />The attraction of Pendergast was his personal and background mystery and in attempting to respond to the begging for more information on him, they have succeeded in removing enough mystery to render AXLP significantly less exciting.  Adding that to a time worn theme of Nazis and throwing in additional, unnecessary characters left me wondering if they had, as the saying goes, \\"jumped the shark\\".  The topping was to take another of their fascinating, quirky characters and add a side story that stripped her of her intrigue as well.  Not to mention that the side story was mundane and contributed nothing  to the storyline and only served to make the book longer.<br /><br />In the attempt to satisfy the clamoring fans, they even brought back a character for the sole purpose of noting that she won't be in any further books!  She was generally disliked by readers anyway and it would have been better to have her just drop from further mention.<br /><br />I will continue to read books by Doug Preston and Lincoln Child, whether written together or separately, but I sincerely hope that they will reconsider giving in to the pleading for more information than we really want to know.  I hope that they will consider returning to the mysterious backgrounds and quirky characters that have made their careers.  Individually, they are each outstanding writers but when they get togetherthere are none that are better.  Unfortunately, of all of the many books they have written, this is without a doubt my least favorite.  I almost felt like they, too, had mixed feelings about giving in to their readers and just wanted to finish the promised trilogy-hopefully so that they can return to the writing that I know they are capable of doing.
B00B2TUKI0|5.0|Terrific sixties (and earlier) standards given the Peyroux treatment, making them sound both French and blusey and making each song brand new- as if only written for her voice, Glen Campbell, Leonard Cohen, Ray Charles and even the Everly Brothers are given a new fresh life which makes your ears prick as they hear the words for the first time. Bravo Madame!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent!  We downloaded the entire series, and loved it!  We will watch it again before the next season is available.
1780721676|3.0|This is a brittish book and I was hoping for one that in English. Wish I could find an English written one.
B006CHML4I|4.0|I've only had this watch for a week or 2 but I am very impressed with the product. I've never liked wearing watches due to them being uncomfortable.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-Handsome watch, simple easy to read, lightweight.<br />-Clear caseback is handsome and although the movement isn't much to look at, it is a cool feature to have<br />-Date and Day of the week function is very useful<br />-I've only been monitoring how the watch runs the last few days. In the last 47 hours its gained about 1 second. I haven't been able to assess its accuracy any further or its consistency but it is very promising to have a low-level automatic be this accurate out of the box.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The canvas strap it comes with was uncomfortable for me. The rings dug into my wrist making it uncomfortable for me.<br />I purchased a leather watch strap and a deployant for easier access. It really dressed up the watch and it is much more comfortable for me. This was in my original plan but i didn't expect the canvas strap to be so uncomfortable.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|What a great book!  Thank you,  Jaime McGuire,for those quiet hours of reading!<br />Can't wait to read the next one!
B00005NWLO|5.0|Had the original lp. That has long ago been worn out... Very happy with this purchase!<br />Some of the songs have been remastered and sound awesome.<br />If you are a skynyrd fan you must own this!<br />SQ is very good, I consider this one of, if not the best live album ever produced!<br />Shipping was the usual Amazon affair,,, fast and well packed.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Gr8 documentary on food quality. It held my interest throughout. Ok, tha't 10 words.<br /> Ok six more words required. Done.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|It's was good I must say.<br />I like fast things but am not super into bikes though, more into cars.<br /><br />Edit: 9/8/13<br />I gave it 3 stars with the intent of a 'neutral' comment, but it was brought to my knowledge that, that does the film no just, per se.<br />I'll up it to 5 stars based of the film. I don't know allot about superbikes but this film did give me knowledge I did not have. In ways to me it could be looked at as a informative, maybe documentary type store.
B004SMDJ9U|4.0|The acting is very good and the scenery is beautiful. Story lines will probably get a bit old but an enjoyable series.
B001N4RORE|5.0|My friend got me hooked on this movie. I liked the music from ABBA since high school. I actually watched it two nights in a row; Pierce Brosnen is hot and I didn't know 'bond' can sing. I receomend this movie. Thanks. It works perfectly on my Kindle Fire.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I became very tired of pushing my earbuds in while on the elliptical. They'd stay in fine for about 10 minutes until I started to sweat, then it was a constant battle. I ordered these headphones and have been very pleased. They are lightweight and comfortable over my head, and are comfortable in my ears. I don't toss them in a bag, but use them only at home, so they have stood up to months of use just fine. But, I doubt if they'd last very long with very rough use. I have snagged them quite a number of times, and have yet to pop a wire, so they are fairly sturdy.<br /><br />The headband is adjustable, and the cord is about 3 feet long. The ear parts are not round, but are sort of an oval shape which fits the entrance of the ear canal. The plug has fit well into every device I've used it with.<br /><br />I was surprised at how good they sound. They have good base, and the treble sounds are clear. Really, for the price, they are terrific and a great value. Highly recommended- I'll certainly buy another pair when these wear out.<br /><br />EDIT: When I purchased these, they were under $10. Now, they are nearly $40! No way would I pay $40 for these! Sorry- there are other brands out there and while these work just fine as non-slip phones for an hour at the gym, they are not in the $40 class by any stretch of the imagination!
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|This movie was incredibly well done.  The characters were severely troubled and dysfunctional; yet you felt drawn to their pain and hoped for redemption.
B000I3UMLQ|4.0|I know there's been a lot of complaints about this movie, and to tell you the truth, I was really hesitant about watching this film because of all criticisms about it. But in spite of this, I took a chance and viewed it and really had a great time with it.<br /><br />The movie, at least for me, really captured the feel of the old Star Trek series because it centered around the main characters and showed how they relate to each other on and off duty. It was also good to see some of the classic humor that the original Star Trek had. Basically, the movie may not have had as many special effects sci-fi fans wanted, but the storyline isn't about high tech as it is about Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura, Sulu, Checkov, and Scotty. The plot is also vintage Star Trek, and in my book, that's just fine by me. It was like visiting old friends.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it. Shatner took a gamble in trying to recreate that old Star Trek ambiance, and it looks like he did pretty well.
3833160454|5.0|Love this book. Beautiful and clear photography. Detailed explanations. Very informative. Inspires imagination and makes you want to make shoes!  :)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book. Found it hard to stop reading it. Nicholas Sparks has outdone himself once again with this novel.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Truly a wonderful challenging game.<br />At times it is too difficult, but that's what keeps me going...I just know I can do this!<br />The seasons makes it even more appreciative!
B00000IZOR|5.0|very good product, and the estimated transfer passed off without inconvenience. fully recommend buying through this company, very responsible ..
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is a one is cool as a 1 or 2 player game.<br />Its like having your own personal hockey table to share with others.<br />The graphics and colors and speed time is great!
1451683405|4.0|As a believer in the evidence of science rather than unsupported gut-level speculation or popular opinion, I long ago came to the conclusion that free will is an illusion that arises from brain chemistry as determined by our genetic inheritance as we evolved from pond scum to our current place at the top of the food chain. I bought the Harris book--more of an essay, really--to see what he had to say on the subject. Aside from the fact that it is too long when it needn't be, I was satisfied that he came to his conclusion in pretty much the same way as I did... through science.<br /><br />Free will has acquired its hold on popular opinion through its association with that age-old mind softener, religion. From there it was transplanted to the law where it was needed to explain why an accused criminal chose to do his deed when more rational individuals could see that his/her course of action was not conducive to the welfare of the community. Even today in an era of rapidly expanding neuroscience, the free will myth is still hauled out in the pulpits and the courtroom to explain evil or the incomprehensibility of some actions. We can only hope that humans will advance to a place where all can see that neuronal impulses and brain chemistry determine an individual's actions.<br /><br />For those who want to understand the origins of free will, Sam Harris's little book is one to be read and weighed free of traditional judgmental baggage.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I enjoyed the first book, Delirium, and when I found the second book, I knew it could never compare. I've never been more pleased to be wrong. Oliver has continued bringing the reader on a journey into a world that truly comes alive in this book. I have fallen in love with the characters. I've walked with them, cried with them, fallen with them, and prayed for them. With each page I have wanted to read on, while not wanting it to end. When I reached the last page, I was disappointed only because the book was ending. But the very last line was one I had almost lost all hope for. Can't wait to read the next!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a good game for the whole family thank you . The children can learn how to keep up with the very fast paced game and have fun too .
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|It really makes you think about things in a different way. The author makes Sherlock look like the greatest thing since sliced bread, haven't finished yet but am enjoying it so far.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is great. Finally kindle fire has a real facebook app. Before it would just lead you start to web. It doesnt freeze at all. Also it load all post. This app gets 5 stars!!!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app its great. its loud now I'm not late. I reccomend all kindle fire users to download this clock.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am really enjoying this show! I have no idea if its even still running live. I just commend the director and writers for an opportunity to watch a relatively clean drama series. My ears have not been burning from profanity and the sexual innuendo is so appropriately portrayed. The premise of the show will keep you coming back for more action in the courtroom and to find out what the fate of Mr. and Mrs. Florrick will be! What a breath of fresh air! I can only speak to season 1 but hope for ratings sake the other seasons have not changed to much!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Helpful but don't like that is made me create a review of the application in order to continue using it.
B005DCJ1J6|1.0|The copy I recieved had only the background audio. None of the dialogue could be heard.<br />Just posting because I haven't seen a similar complaint.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Like  a number of Oscar winners it's more about the hype than the movie itself. While the story was gripping the acting was so-so. Lincoln on the other hand had some powerful performances that took the story to another dimension.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Being a Marine - this was an excellent read and I really enjoyed reading this book.  I missed being a sniper by 2 point on the rifle ramge - way back when - 57 years ago Ha!!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love all the different configurations! I play as often as I can! I also love all the different choices of music!
B009S33I68|3.0|Maybe the reason I can't get into this book is - I was not in tat war and it never made sense to me - just like the one we;re in now<br /><br />God Bless Our Warriors
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like that there is so many configurations to play! The sounds when the matches are made are really entertaining!
B0015AARJI|1.0|We bought these to supplement our other controllers we have had for years. Things were fine for hte first couple weeks.<br /><br />Then I started to notice weird things. For example, I could barely drive in Gran Turismo with them. After a bit of testing I discovered that the buttons were not analog, and would flicker on and off. A week later they stopped holding a charge, and we ended up tossing them.<br /><br />After close review of the plastics, you could see that they were not made from the same molds as the real controllers. These are cheap knock off counterfeits. Do not buy them!
B0053FANS6|4.0|Must have for any sci-fi/Mummy fans.  Great price! The product arrived on time with no defects.  Purchase this product today!!
0812982622|5.0|This book was an unforgettable journey into a place we often hear about in the headlines.  Adam's masterful storytelling kept me spellbound.  I highly recommend this book.
B0060FXBNM|4.0|Must have for any sci-fi/Transformer fans.  Great price! The product arrived on time with no defects.  Purchase this product today!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am very happy with this cable and with this company's quick mail service. I recommend them to anyone. It is exactly what I wanted.
B0042ETJU2|4.0|Must have for any sci-fi/predator fans.  Great price! The product arrived on time with no defects.  Purchase this product today!!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Very stark (pun intended) and close to the book. Well acted and costumed. I would enjoy seeing the rest of the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|App is extremely user friendly. Love the size of number keys. Has all the convenience of a good hand held. Worth every star!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I think this game is fun. It is a hack and slash that doesn't involve winding your way through any tedious dungeons. It is popping adds up while you play which can lead to accidental tapping of the add. Annoying! All together though it is fun to pick up and hack some trolls or whatever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and entertaining. I love it! My sister and brothers love and play it everyday. The colors are really bright.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I am 72 years old and have seen my share of extraordinary claims when it comes to cures, &#34;natural&#34; remedies and diets. But having chanced upon &#34;It Starts With Food&#34; I decided to start to read it; this turned out to be an easy task since the book is written in easy and humorous prose.  Reading completed, I could find no reason not to &#34;sacrifice&#34; 30 days of my life and stick to the authors' recommended diet.<br />Their beverage of choice is water, but you get to eat three square meals every day and won't be hungry (but may end up with &#34;cravings&#34;, especially at first).  For me, the end result was nothing short of amazing. Considering my age, I was already in good shape, but had my share of little aches and pains. Most of them gradually disappeared during the last couple of weeks and in the end, I completed a five hour car trip in the driver's seat without wanting to stop and trade places with my husband. Both he and I have for several years been bothered by back aches when we sit in a car for an hour or more, but this time, I felt no pain at all.<br />And yes, I lost weight also, at least a dress size.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game ever you should download it  amazing I rate it a 5 star you can change your character and everything
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Adobe reader is a much needed tool when ever you need to read some info or mailings on the computer.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|After watching the Walking Dead AMC series, I didn't know what to expect from the books. I find them as compelling as the TV series.<br /><br />Well done.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|This product was just what I needed and exactally what I orded. I appreciate the quick shipping and I recommend this to anyone. Thank you and God Bless.
B004A8ZX2I|3.0|Unknown was directed by Jaune Collet-Serra and co-stars January Jones and Aidan Quinn. All the action, and there is plenty of it, takes place in Berlin. I can say in its favor that it is never boring and that the views of Berlin are interesting.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Great product. I love it and I recommend anyone who wants to buy from this company. Have a great day. keep reading!!!!!!
B001GCUNYO|2.0|I usually like Neeson's films, but Taken by director Pierre Morel strains the viewer's credibility. Neeson takes on an army of kidnappers of women and releases his daughter by himself alone. This one does not rank with his best films.
B001CTDH76|5.0|This product was just what I needed and exactally what I orded. I appreciate the quick shipping and I recommend this to anyone. Thank you and God Bless.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Morgan Freeman is the guy who can get you anything you want from the outside for a fee. Tim Robbins can file your taxes or make a will for you. This film looks great and is guaranteed to make you smile.<br />I note that many reviewers here were disappointed that the film did not win an Oscar. I agree with them. Frank Darabont (Green Mile, The Mist) wrote and directed this film with a great cast. Highly recommended.
B002JCSWV6|5.0|This story, based on real events early in Nelson Mandela's presidency, is one from which all of us could learn. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Mr. Mandela, and Matt Damon's portrayal of the captain of the national rugby team are thoughtful and very well done. Anybody who wonders or despairs over how we can break the cycle of hatred and violence in the world must see this video!
B0013BCWEW|5.0|There appeared to be many Zodiac Killers. Not all the attacks happened in the San Francisco Bay Area. The first attack was in the nearby city of Vallejo in 1969, accompanied in the Director's Cut by Donovan's song Hurdy Gurdy Man. Then followed attacks in Sonoma and Lake Berryessa near Napa. In 1970 there was an attack in San Francisco, which followed the first attack in Southern California in the city of Riverside.<br />It is evident that there was not just one Zodiac Killer, but many copycat killers. There were many suspects, but the real Zodiac was not found after many investigations by the state government in Sacramento.<br />The excellent presentation by Director David Fincher gives a good idea of the fear that existed in California without overplaying it.
B006R1T40I|5.0|While most old timer musicians are just touring with ancient hits, Bonnie shows up with one of the best blues/ jazz tunes I have heard in years.  The first song has so much rhythm and blues that I had to stop everything and play it again and again.  Completely impressive.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I just love the subtle humor the Muppets have.  It's great to have just a bit of a different perspective that's lighter but still follows the story.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great series!  The picture quality and the sound was amazing!  Definatly a must see! Kept me want to keep watching!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Love Tolkien and especially the way Peter Jackson does these movies (the effort in creating all the special effects, etc.)
B002UWH8P6|5.0|This is hands down the most artistically proficient, by far.  Btw, This show is not sexist!  Anyone that thinks so has personal issues.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well first of all the game is a maxing but I think it would be better if once you get a power up you keep until you die.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I love this book! It's simply amazing. Easy to read, great, catching story! Now if I can just get paid to get the rest of the series!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great way to catch up on the 3 seasons I missed in preparation for the 4th.  A great way to spend a cold or rainy day.
B004FA8NOQ|5.0|- Purchased 5/2011 from the Egg - $314 at time of purchase<br /><br />--- Pros ---<br />* Still working (2 yrs)<br />* Stable 4.5ghz like nothing<br />* Cold (with aftermarket cooling) 62C / 143F under load<br /><br />--- Cons ---<br />* None<br /><br />--- Thoughts ---<br />* I bought a 2600k and Asrock Extreme4 back in 5/2011. With experimenting I was able to overclock it to 4.5ghz at 1.385v. Idles at 35C, Load at 62C. To this day the overclock is still running solid. Used with Arctic Silver and Zalman 9700.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the awesomest and most addictive game ever and the best part about it is that every once and a while they change the location like one was Rome now it is Sydney
B0092ZEIN4|5.0|I really like to play emulators on my tablet or cellphone, but I'm a gamer and I need to feel the bottons in my fingers, and in a tablet is not very easy to play with on-screen bottons, so I found this and so far, I really love it! It even works as a mouse LOL
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely love this series. Couldn't put it down til the end. Can't wait until the next book! I like this better than Fifty Shades of Gray.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Amazing film! Heartwarming and exhilarating at the same time. A must see this year! It will surely please everyone in the home!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've been playing this game for the past week---its loads of fun! I'm competing with my brothers and sisters by connecting to fafebook.  This game is a lot better than Temple Run!! Please don't hesitate to download.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I don't know what made me choose this book.  The reviews made it look interesting.  But I was hooked.  It was heartbreaking in some places and unexpectedly uplifting in others.  By the end I was  captivated.  It's a really good read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun for everyone! I've handed it off to my friend's kids and they love playing it!! The graphics are great and its awesome how they change cities every so often. Yes, it does get redundant but what game doesn't??
1451638450|4.0|DO NOT READ THIS UNTIL YOU'VE READ MOST OF THE REST OF THE MILES/BARRAYAR NOVELS. Or it will seem very thin fare indeed; if I didn't already know Ivan, and didn't already wish him a happy ending, this book would not have been nearly as satisfying.<br /><br />The novel centers around Miles' big, less intelligent, very good-looking cousin Ivan, and it's obvious early on it's really centered on Ivan's big romance, and nope, this isn't going to be Anna Karenina.<br /><br />Summary (no spoilers): Ivan isn't as much of an idiot when Miles isn't present and thinking of everything first; Ivan accidentally gets a woman who suits him quite well; Ivan has good friends.<br /><br />(Outline - very mild spoilers): The book starts out in a fun, somewhat Miles-like case of subterfuge and shenanigans, but unlike a Miles plot (where more and more layers are always discovered) things fairly quickly get sorted out, and then it's time for Ivan's girl to meet his family and friends (everyone's perfect) and later for Ivan to meet her family (everyone's a snake, but a pack of snakes that loves Ivan's girl, even if she is oddly un-snake-like.) No surprise, the un-snake-like girl finds Ivan even more attractive when she hangs out with her relatives.<br /><br />All of which makes this book sound like a terrible read, but I liked it. The first half of the book is very pleasant, the second half...not so much, but still quite readable.<br /><br />There were a couple of plot holes that were only partially filled in; it would give away too much to discuss them in detail and exactly why I didn't feel they'd been resolved. I find their existence a bit alarming appearing in the normally solid explanations I expect from Bujold.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I don't know how historically accurate the series is, but it is interesting. I'm quite sure the real Henry was not as sexy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many twists and turns!  I can't believe I read it waaaaay before the date of my book club.  The best part is that there are so many &#34;Ohhhh!&#34; moments!!!  Couldn't put it down.
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I just never used it, if I went to linkend I just went to there linkein site. Just wasnt somethiong I would use
0394800184|5.0|The message, graphics, and illustrations make this book a wonderful tool for children, especially those who may have &#34;lost&#34; a parent.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This was an incredible season that built on the developments of the last season. We see the effects of the how and how the lives of the folks upstairs and those downstairs changes as a result. As usual, compelling characters with Maggie Smith stealing the show everytime she appears. Some of the plot twists towards the end could be seen a mile away but still one of the best on TV.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A great book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys war-type books, and might even recommend it just as a book that makes you think in ways you may not have before.
B0002ZDVF4|1.0|Not my idea of a thriller. . .<br /><br />What you get here is someone escaping forever in a blur of images, with the camera shaking and tilting constantly, and with background noise \\"music\\".
B007XIC1GI|3.0|This book was a page turner, This band is sick. Like a train wreck, couldn't stop reading! Motley crew has nothing on this book.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Of course the full game is not free... what is? It was a little pricier than average, but also a great game. If you enjoy these kind of games, it's one of the better ones that I've played (along with Ravenhurst and Enigmatus). Enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is a fun time. I like all the activities to do with the Horse . The graffics are pretty good.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a lot of fun my entire family is competing against one another. you can win coins collect the or buy them
B00633PFQC|5.0|Truly I believe it's time for human beings to think this great question.<br />Or we all will need to pay for that ( in a much higher price) .
B003XQM2YU|5.0|This movie is an excellent story and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. It moves at a perfect pace as all the threads come together. Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe work their magic again. Of course Cate Blanchett is excellent also. Two thumbs up!
B00506NRBS|4.0|If you've ever thought about starting anything, read Derek's story. You'll get a perspective that will help you find what you are looking for.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Wish I had time to watch more often - it is a real plus to be able to see the reunion
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome but it's not letting me update it!!! I tried doing what it told me to do before to update it but it's not working!!! I want to surf in Sydney but it's not letting me!! If u have an answer PLEASE TELL ME !!!
B000SLP4SE|4.0|show was exciting from start to finish,love the storyline.hope to see more of this kind of movie on amazon prime!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It I  hard by  th  fact of  th  game is to b  perfect an  th  neuralgia b  lovely you can nowhere in life I  you
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was great, practical advice for women in the workplace. There are no easy answer, but it inspired me to know that someone as successful as Sheryl Sandburg has felt insecure and inadequate in her job at times too. Must read for any female.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is quite possibly the most fun and addictive game I jab  ever played in the entire world of gaming.Well worth every second I have played.
B008220C38|1.0|I like the actors so I got the movie. What a disappointment. What a waste. I was looking for good acting and good locations. Got neither!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game but it won't let me update it.<br />Then I uninstaled it and it still wouldn't work.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I teach Basic Culinary Arts and Nutrition at a public high school.  I show this to my students every year.  It is such a good example of the rewards of tenacity.  Neither Julia or Julie got it right the first time.  Julia Child set so many important presidents. Today's beginning cooks should all learn who she is and what she did.  However, we do also discuss the limiting of her rich recipes to occasionally rather than a steady diet.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It if a fun game. It sharpens your hunting skills.  It's a game that if you like to hunt for stuff you need to download it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I bought this album as a deal for $1.99 just because I liked the &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; song. I was pleasantly surprised with the other songs on this album; very well written and executed. This album's made it to my favorites list.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. I saw in the theatre but had to own the Blu-ray for myself so I could watch over and over. Better than on Broadway.
B007VYAJAE|5.0|This has to be my favorite documentary about bobby, very in-depth and close to how bob really was including multiple family interviews, and many close-friend interviews.<br />Makes me want to be a Rastafarian and dig out a wooden pipe meeself.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Used it for charging and working at the same time.  Could not do that with the basic cable that came with it.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|If you HAVE to deal with fractions, this handy little app is the way to go. Great little app. It makes fraction work simple.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I like the Game of Thrones because it is an ongoing saga.  You can really get into its world.  It is probably better if you have read the book because there is so much detail that is just suggested in the video.  It is a bit bloody, but the  violence is not gratuitous.  The costumes, sets, and detail are supurb.  The HBO recoding is a bit difficult to manage.  I still have not figured out how to pause the episode and come back to the same scene the next day.  There is not the usual scene index, so you can't go to a particular scene or skip over scenes.  However,  I would definitely recommend it to people who like adult fantasy.  It is similar to The Lord of the Rings but with more sex and blood.  The more you see it and the more you know about the details (read  the  descriptions of the episode), the more interesting it is.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Okay, it's TV drama...what do you expect?  It's okay, but very tedious and very predictable, except for the fact that actors and actresses are continually wanting to leave the show and then the writers and producers need to find a way to kill them off.  Kind of stupid!
B003O86FMW|5.0|You want to cheer for them, cry and want to help them through their trials of the games and the beginning of battle.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|A fantastic little device to convert / recycle your old power pack and stop you from throwing it away. Also means you can leave one at work and one at home thus saving you from extra weight especially if you're carry a MacBook Air!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Must read to put the whole story together.  You become friends with the people and you want to cry and also stand up and cheer.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Moderately challenging , very easy to get caught up in the game and lose track of time. Music is catchy and motivating.<br />Especially love that I got it for free.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This also is a great cd.  I wish I could see the broadway production.  Maybe someday. My sister and friend also love this production.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the gratest game. I play this almost all day can't get enough of it. Can't wait for a part two.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book addresses the subject of domestic violence, true love, second chances, bravery, and mystic intervention.  The book keeps your interest and leaves you feeling good.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I don't like writing reviews.  I just like rating the products.  I haven't figured out yet how to rate and not review.
B0060MYM3S|1.0|Don't get me wrong: I love Game of Thrones. It is one of my favorite series of all time. I've watched every episode to date with enthusiasm.<br /><br />This review is about the un-skippable ad at the beginning of the DVD, completely loaded with spoilers.<br /><br />I got this DVD as a gift for my friend who hasn't seen any of season 2. They were spoiled within 30 seconds of watching by this ridiculous advertisement. Why on earth would anyone think it a good idea to force-advertise the show that is already being watched?? What an atrocious marketing department these guys have.<br /><br />It's this reason alone I have to give this product 1 star, as it manages to completely ruin itself literally within 30 seconds of hitting &#34;Play&#34;. If you give it as a gift or for yourself, just be warned.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|Ehh, it was OK story was good, the action scenes were OK, but the film was too vanilla for my liking
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Perfect for killing time or getting your mind off of things.  Waiting rooms, for example.<br />Strangely addictive . . .
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|The 6 year old viewer like the magic hair idea.  The 9 year old viewer liked the passionate conflict between characters.
B00BSW6F26|4.0|There is a youtube walkthrough now, so I don't get why some reviewers are still so negative.  Maybe because there are no hints available in the game?<br />Some areas are very dark.  It was hard to find the map pieces, they blended in with the wood floor (hint).  That's what I used the walkthrough for.  The game itself wasn't bad at all.  The next move was usually pretty logical.<br />I finished in just over an hour, on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen.  Played great.  Highly recommend.<br />Thanks, Magic Frame Studios, we need more games like this for our Kindles (only longer!).
B004LLDN3A|4.0|The six year old viewer likes the idea of flying people.  The 9 year old liked that the adults grew to be nicer to the children.

B003Y059EK|3.0|Big production of the dark and meaningless side of Oz. The acting, score, and set design are wonders to behold, but they do not add up to enchantment. Too dark for children, it also does not seem to have anything more than a colorful plot, so most adults won't be entertained. lots of falling and screaming, chases, and some characters (especially the Wheelers) who are better suited to a B-Grade horror flick.Adding more humor and depth of meaning MIGHT have elevated this film.
0205313426|5.0|This is a great book for a writer and it's entertaining as well. Again why with the word number requirement?

B0042JIL2E|4.0|I had written the name of this band down for some forgotten reason. I ordered it thinking it was more Irish... I found it to be very interesting reminiscent of April Smith meets Lucinda Williams. I like it, I don't love it. It gets play in regular rotation, but I would tire of it if I played it even a little too often.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The plot was unexpected- The characrers were real. I couldn't put it down. Predictible but a good read. Ended well
0385349831|3.0|After reading 1/2 the book I've had enough of it to get the general idea.  The setup is a town, Jerusalem, about to be attacked in the middle ages and the townspeople asking their Sage for wisdom so they can disseminate it throughout the world.  Good advice? Sure. Heard it all before? Sure. It's a small easy read, and if that's what you are looking for, then this is it.
B008M7JODC|5.0|If u love sci fi then u will love this! Its like CSI mixed with Mad scientists!  It is wonderful!
B008ASGP3U|4.0|This is the first time I have read a book that takes its mystery to another country. This time to Scotland where the author devotes time in allowing the reader to visualize the countryside of Scotland.  I found some of the names of towns rather &#34;foreign&#34; so to speak, than as a reader of only U.S. mystery novels.  I really liked the main character Inspector Rebus.  He is kind of a lone wolf in the more modern Scottish investigation system.  He makes the story fun.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend it but since I had to guess at some of the terminology, I could not fully relate.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This has become my favorite group. The lyrics are definitely poetry. The voices of the lead singers are unique and beautiful.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is great.  The group combines top 40 songs with soundtracks and classics.  I have a few favorites on this CD including &#34;A Thousand Years&#34; and &#34;Somewhere Over The Rainbow.&#34;  I would highly recommend this CD.

B004LWZWGA|4.0|This is the finality of the Dark Knight trilogy and a wonderful one.  For fans, it does not disappoint.  For those new to the series, you will become a fan and go back and watch the first two movies in the trilogy.  Tom Hardy is a surprisingly wonderful Bane!

B008NB0SQO|5.0|Have always liked this movie.  It has become a Christmas tradition in our house.<br /><br />Had it on VHS tape and no longer use VHS.  DVD is much more user friendly, smaller to store and provides higher quality.<br /><br />A fun movie for all the family.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I wanted something I could play on my Kindle and I love Big Fish games on my PC so I thought I would try it. This game is so much fun and the great thing is my grandkids can play it too!
0345529057|5.0|Everyone knows about the series, but as for these books themselves, the tradeoff for costing under $5 each is that they're very weak and flimsy, and are very easy to damage no matter how careful you are. I've found these are an excellent way to pass the books around to my friends and get them into the series, without worrying about stuffing them in bags etc. since they get damaged anyway.<br />Personally, I'm going to wait until the series is done (assuming myself and/or Martin are still alive) for some kind of premium hardcover set to come out, but this product is a must for everyone who wants to own the start of the series right away.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love all of the unkockables and prizes.  If I had to suggest anything it would be even more unlockable worlds and collectables.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I included this book for a sophomore level Fantasy Literature course I was teaching in my university.  Some of the students felt it didn't have a tremendous lot of action (!), but we all concluded it was an unusually powerful and thought provoking book.
B000Y179KO|2.0|They should have named this album \\"Not Quite Hotel California\\".  There's maybe a few songs that are \\"okay\\" and the title track is about 5 minutes too long.

B0090SI4LU|1.0|Have you ever seen a TV show or movie about parasitic aliens trying to conquer humanity? If so, did you ever think, \\"If only the aliens would realize what special snowflakes humans are! If only humans would realize that parasitic brain-squids that steal unwilling victims' bodies aren't bad!\\"<br /><br />Of course you didn't. Nobody with half a brain would.<br /><br />But Stephenie Meyer did. The result: a soft sci-fi movie called \\"The Host,\\" which takes a promising idea (what if the body-snatching aliens WON?) and promptly runs it into the ground. Not only is there pretty much no plot to this movie, but it is riddled with flat characters and a total lack of any kind of excitement. Oh, and there's the romanticizing of aliens who steal bodies.<br /><br />In the not-too-distant future, the Earth has been completely conquered by a race of glowing brain-squids known as Souls (ugh), who possess human bodies. Only a few actual humans are left. When one girl named Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is captured by the Seekers, she becomes the new host for a Soul named Wanderer.<br /><br />Immediately after Wanderer is implanted, a Seeker (Diane Kruger) tries to find out where the other humans are hiding. However, the real Melanie is still there, inside her own head -- and her memories begin to affect Wanderer.<br /><br />When the Seeker's plans threaten Melanie's life, Wanderer/Melanie escape into the desert in search of Melanie's boyfriend Jared (Max Irons), little brother Jamie (Chandler Canterbury) and the other free humans. However, they aren't too pleased to find a Soul-possessed Melanie in their midst. And even as Wanderer (renamed \\"Wanda\\") tries to gain their trust, she finds herself falling for someone who isn't Jared.<br /><br />It's hard to express just how brain-meltingly dull \\"The Host\\" is. After Melanie escapes from the Seekers, the movie slows to the pace of half-frozen mud and never speeds up again. Occasionally something dramatic will happen -- the Seeker's attack, Jamie's life-threatening injury -- but it's always neatly resolved in just a few minutes.<br /><br />Instead, most of the movie revolves around a tepid love triangle, and Wanda just hanging around the human compound, harvesting wheat and smooching teen boys. As if the lack of a plot weren't bad enough, we're constantly tortured by Melanie's screeching inner monologue, which tends to break up any moments that could have been quiet.<br /><br />And really, it wouldn't be a Stephenie Meyer movie unless it romanticized parasitic creatures -- in this case, glowing CGI squids that physically respond to love, peace and kindness. Excuse me while I vomit. Don't expect the movie to address the horrific moral implications of stealing an unwilling victim's body, either -- that would be too deep and intense for a movie like this.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan is one of my favorite up-and-coming young actresses, and she does seem to be giving the role her all. But it's a losing battle. Though the movie assures us that Melanie is a rare and special creature with amazing inner strength, she comes across as a bland, utterly typical teen girl with no special qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />Most of the other actors are completely wasted -- the characters have no development, no history and no motivations. Even the love interests are difficult to tell apart because there's almost nothing to  distinguish them. It makes the whole movie feel drained of any drama, because we don't know these characters enough to care -- when two humans commit suicide to avoid the Seekers, all I could think was, \\"Who were they again? Did they even have lines?\\"<br /><br />\\"The Host\\" is an utter failure as a sci-fi movie -- it takes a good idea and squanders it on a tepid, sluggish story that never bothers to have a real plot. Thankfully, we probably won't get a sequel.k, Jamie's life-threatening injury -- but it's always neatly resolved in just a few minutes.<br /><br />Instead, most of the movie revolves around a tepid love triangle, and Wanda just hanging around the human compound, harvesting wheat and smooching teen boys.

B00C6F60TC|5.0|Imagine a world where your future is determined by your genes. Your schools, your job, your social status are all determined by what genetic flaws you have.<br /><br />Such is the world that we see in \\"Gattaca,\\" a scarily plausible sci-fi story that examines the implications of eugenics and genetic enhancement. Director Andrew Niccol thankfully never gets too preachy or \\"uplifting\\" -- instead he crafts a cleanly elegant story with a murder mystery as the catalyst, and the strong trinity Jude Law, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.<br /><br />Vincent Freeman (Hawke) is an \\"invalid,\\" conceived without eugenic technology. On the day he was born, it was predicted that he would be myopic, might be bipolar, and would probably die at thirty from a heart defect. Throughout his life, Vincent dreams of becoming an astronaut, but his genetic status dooms him to menial labor.<br /><br />The solution: Vincent \\"buys\\" the identity and genetic profile of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Law), an Olympic swimmer who broke his back in a car crash. Vincent will pay Jerome, and Jerome will provide him with blood, urine, skin and hair samples.<br /><br />With Jerome's help, Vincent is accepted into Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, and is chosen for a manned flight to Titan. But when one of the administrators is found murdered, the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes nearby. If they discover who Vincent truly is, he won't just lose his dream -- he'll be convicted of murder.<br /><br />\\"Gattaca\\" is a movie that addresses one of life's great questions -- does destiny determine how we live our lives, or do we decide our own fate? There are no easy answers, but it's always best to err on the side of \\"we can make our own destiny\\" -- and this movie is basically all about one man's quest to determine his own fate, DNA be damned.<br /><br />None of the movies Andrew Niccol has made since \\"Gattaca\\" have even come close to this level of skill -- the movie is a slow, elegant winding of murder mystery and philosophical sci-fi. The plot quietly grows in tension as Vincent's life becomes more tangled up in lies and suspicion, with quietly powerful dialogue laced with dry humor (\\"I guess we can rule out suicide,\\" comments a cop as they bag a bloodied keyboard).<br /><br />And it's beautifully filmed. Everything is full of clean lines and cold light, with the occasional moment of symbolism -- note that the apartment that Eugene and Vincent share is centered around a giant DNA-style spiral staircase.<br /><br />And the final puzzle pieces are the actors, who are all really good. Ethan Hawke gives a quietly powerful performance as a man who goes to desperate lengths to fulfill his dreams, and Uma Thurman has the right mix of icy reserve and sweetness as a \\"valid\\" woman who falls in love with the man rather than his DNA.<br /><br />But the best performance is Jude Law. Jerome a truly tragic character, whose genetic perfection wasn't enough to keep disaster away -- he's proof that DNA can't make your life good or rewarding. Law plays him with a mixture of bitter wit and compassion, with perpetually shadowed eyes and a drink always in his hand. You may cheer for Vincent, but your heart will bleed for Jerome.<br /><br />\\"Gattaca\\" is a masterpiece of science fiction -- a richly nuanced, beautifully understated work that reminds you that, no matter where we come from, we can all reach for the stars.ical sci-fi.

B00000DF6O|5.0|In his long and storied career, The King of the Blues has had few records out that match the quality of this one. Perfect sound, recorded with a band of top musicians who clearly idolize The King, this is a classic to stand against any blues record (not just his own) of the past 50 years. Put this one on at any party and watch how your guests react. Members of this same great band backed B. on the \\"B.B. King Live at Montreaux\\" DVD from the early 90s, in one of his finest live performances ever. The Master at the very top of his game!

One or three events in the e.version Don't match with what I remember.<br /><br />This is such a lovely story. It has character and inspiration to improve character. I won't misreading the printed Copenhagen I find it again.<br /><br />I recommend this as a fine family read at night or a read it and discuss around the dinner table. Old fashioned perhaps, but full of description to fire the imagination.

B000KJTOMQ|5.0|This is the second Waugh book I've read, and once again I've found myself a bit impatient early on, but totally enthralled and captivated by the end.<br /><br />Comparing it with \\"A Handful Of Dust\\", which was written 11 years earlier, you can certainly see Waugh's development as a writer. The plot is not necessarily as jarring it was in \\"A Handful of Dust\\", but Brideshead Revisited certainly a better showcase of Waugh's mastery of vivid prose writing.<br /><br />The tone is very nostalgic. The prose is packed with rich settings, smells, and tastes. I imagine I never have and never will read a better \\"eating scene\\" than Charles Ryder and Rex Mottram eating at the restaurant in London.<br /><br />However, it isn't just a fluffy book of word-play. There are parts of this book that can hit like a ton of bricks. Through the characters, deep things are weighed. For instance, Julia's realization is quite stark: \\"the worse I am, the more I need God\\".<br /><br />I will not provide any sort of further analysis of Brideshead. You can find that elsewhere. I will say, though, that this is a book that I think will stand up to a second reading, and I plan to re-read it at some point.
0385349947|5.0|This book is a must-read for anyone with ambition. Especially good for mentors. I am enjoying it thoroughly. Two thumbs up.

B005LAII3U|5.0|Though based upon the same short story by Phillip K. Dick, this 2012 version and the 1990 version starring Arnold Schwarzenegger are rather incomparable, even though every one does. The films have different cinematic qualities in every sense.<br /><br />The earlier Schwarzenegger Total Recall was an entertaining hokey joke. Watching it again reminds that Paul Verhoeven tried too hard to cover too many bases in constructing a sci-fi action flick that can hardly take itself seriously. This jumble looks and feels dated, even as it retains its charms.<br /><br />The Collin Ferrell version is a tightly-spun action thriller: Jason Bourne in the land of Blade Runner post-apocalypse. The cameo nods to the earlier version are a quaint touch, but this movie stands on its own as outstanding. The acting, cinematography and directing are all expertly done.<br /><br />In time, the 2012 Total Recall is likely to be more highly considered than it is now. All the negative reviews read like built-in biases; not enjoying a movie on its own merits. Both versions are classic takes, albeit in very different ways.
B00371XIJE|2.0|It is a nice story, perhaps for a short film. This is one and a half hours of a dog running back to the train station to wait for his master, with an annoying soundtrack constantly playing in the background trying to drag tears out of you. It is an hour and a half of my life I will never get back.

0307720748|5.0|But only because it's addicting. You know Branso'ns style, and this book doesn't let down because of the fact that it resembles a thriller. It actually can get you worried when he writes about going to the bak to ask for millions for a business idea everybody KNOWS it's not going to work. But at the end, it does, and you are so happy that you can't wait to read the next chapter (adventure) in Richard's business life. By the way, this book was recommended to me by the CEO of one of the largest airlines in the world. Five intense days were enough for me to read the book, despite the anger from my wife who couldn't attract my attention by any means.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Finally a TV series worth my time.  The script is clever and the plot twists are unforeseen.  Unfortunate that on a personal level some  of the characters are killed off, but I guess that even gives the writers a twist that was unpredictable to them!
B000WCDI5K|5.0|What's not to love!! They are great, and I am a follower of their stuff. Maybe not my favorite, but they are artists!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The moment I started the book, I was astonished. John Green did an excellent job portraying the characters and creating a story that made me cry. I love how the story ended with more of a hopeful story, rather than a cliff hanger. Now officially on the top of my list of favorite books.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I have read the Hobit book and was addicted to it so i wanted to see how they would put it into the movie. They did a fantastic job with keeping it close to the plot of the book. I think it is going to be another trilogy though. It is completely worth the buying price.

It goes to show you that humans are more capable than we give ourselves credit for....The record - A Tarahumara native could run 400+ miles in a few days.....WITHOUT standard shoes. Thats right. A thin piece of leather between them and the ground. Its all in the stride, and how you run. Look up ultrarunners. If you have hip issues, back pain, etc from running in regular shoes, give barefeet (or as close to it) a try. You will run/jog/walk different - you will have to b/c your heel is not cushioned. Which is the way we were born. We were born that way for a reason. The author pulls from personal experiences as well as tests, to doctors, to a tribe that has been doing this for thousands of years....seek the truth.
0307341577|1.0|very dark and gruesome and a big disappointment after Gone Girl. I don't recommend it.  I think her writing improved after this book.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|Never knew of any star so humble. I full heartedly support her!!! She gives so much back fighting for equal rights, and being a strong supporter of &#34;you are born this way&#34; -and we all have gifts. She doesnt care!! And neither should your neighbor as long as you are not hurting someone else. Yes, she has weird outfits, uncanny music videos, etc but she does this out of artistic expression. All her songs are fantastic so this is worth the purchase. I can't think of a song I dont like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally additive to play.  Love ease of play.  Works great on my kindle fire.  I have no problems at all with play.  Also like the ability to buy past missions if needed
B003YUQ71E|3.0|My shoes arrived and there was a slight ridge inside on shoe where the inside sole and upper canvas parts are sewn together. One shoe was fine but the other had a ridge that was digging into my foot. I tried them for bit but they were ultimately uncomfortable. I returned them. They were however really well made and had it not been for the ridge issue I would've kept them. Perhaps i got a defective pair. I did take others advice and ordered a size larger and they fit just right. So that's good advice.
1476733953|5.0|When I origionally purchased this book I was not expecting too much.  Afterall, what could be exciting about a story of people living in an underground silo.  Well, I was wrong.  This is a great read.  The characters and plot development quickly pull you into their fascinating underground world.  There were times where I felt it was a little slow but overall an excellent read.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|I purchased the movie for my children who love the movie. I had to purchase more 3D glasses for my children to watch the movie.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have watched all of &#34;The Game of Thrones&#34; and really loved reading about what will be happening in Season 3 and beyond!<br /><br />If you like fantasy, this is a great  read.
B001VNB54A|3.0|There's nothing terrible about this movie, but you probably won't find yourself itching to watch it again. That's if you make it through all 10 discs. The characters just didn't inspire that sense of attachment that I had with Band of Brothers. The battles scenes all look the same after a while and you start to wonder if you accidentally replayed the same episode you were watching last time.<br /><br />Overall, quality of the product is good, and video quality is excellent. I was just hoping for more out of the film itself. The best part is probably the scenes from Guadalcanal, but you may consider renting it from Netflix first before sinking money into the set.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Kids love this movie. It's a kids friendly-ish movie for teens and maybe pre-teens. Be warned that your kids will be singing these songs for the next six week minimum.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My boyfriend got me and my son hooked on this game. I just showed my 10 year old who has autism how to play today and he's hooked. I even had to install it on his kindle so we both can play.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read every one of Connelly's books and this is another great Bosh Novel. It will not disappoint. I could not put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is so addictive my whole family loves it the daily challenge and missions missions fun I love the world tour
B008KMHFJY|5.0|oh my god best book ever.. what it not to love about Travis this book will live in my heart forever.
B00028HBKM|1.0|The one I ordered stated that it was in english not english subtitled so I am going to return it and hope to get the correct one
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Heart-breaking, funny, never maudlin, Frank McCourt recounts his excruciating childhood in such a matter-of-fact way that it's a marvel. You can be sobbing one minute, then laughing out loud a minute later. There are not enough words to describe my love for this book.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show!  The characters are interesting and story line keeps you wanting more.  Each episode makes you want the next one right away. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes a good law drama!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This had been on my list of books to buy for a while due to all of the hype.  Two things prompted this purchase - I received a Kindle for my birthday and one of my friends said she threw the book in the trash when she reached a certain point.  Well, I liked it.  I liked the story being narrated from Anastasia's point of view so none of us knew what was going on in the mind of Christian.  The scenes were very vivid, and prompted a physical response that was surprising to me.  I'd recommend it to my friends.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|Got it for myself and as a gift for my son...well done.  Just received Eagles--The Studio Albums 1972-1979...stay tuned for more accolades.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is another great game from G5. I have to say this game has great graphics and a good story line.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is the best comeback CD I've purchased in a long time. .Justin did it up right with this 20/20 CD.<br />I can hardly wait for the next release in the fall.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a surprisingly suspenseful and thought provoking read. I've already recommended this book to other members of my family.
B000H305U0|5.0|I love this CD by Justin Timberlake he's really a great R&B/POP performer!!<br />The slow tunes are great too! I recommend everyone purchase it today.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Reading a good book is one of my most favorite things and this book did not disappoint.  The beginning was a tad slow, but the story builds and you are hooked!  There are several possible endings and I was both surprised and pleased with how the author chose to end the book ... I recommend this book to mystery lovers and readers who enjoy the unexpected.
B0030DHPGQ|2.0|Although this book was very in-depth in showing how others made changes it didn't seem to be as much of a how-to guide. Want what I expected and I had to force myself to finish it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very entertaining and especially if your a horse lover like me. this game is fun and woyld teach you very good things to take care of your horse:)
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Got mine on sale for $99, well worth the money. You can tell the difference when playing games, especially Skyrim :D.
B008D30K7E|3.0|When reading this I was reminded of the movie Forest Gump.  It is a book I kept putting down and coming back to as old man moved from one  contrived scenario to another. There are some funny moments and in the end the old man philosophy on life it actually quite a nice one, which  like the book is quite laid back and unassuming.  I am glad I persevered and finished the book but it is a bit silly.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|The only negative I have about the purchase was that one of the audio CD was stuck in the case and cracked in half while trying to remove it.
B007X1ZQSU|5.0|If you like Thin Lizzy at all and don't already have the whole albums, then you should get this. The sound is really nice.
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|After hearing the review of Rhye, and watching a couple of videos on YouTube, I decided to order this. I was not disappointed! This is the perfect relaxing, easy listening, &#34;date&#34; music. I can't get enough of it!
B002M87V0A|5.0|Simply one of the best - top 5 perhaps - musicals of all time.  Period piece, phenomenal score.  Don't miss it!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Clear thoughts on why soldiers do what they do and their feelings about their actions and the service they provide.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best I have read in a long time.  I couldn't put it down. Told so many about this book and it interesting theme.
6304806418|5.0|This is certainly far better than the Broadway musical. The cinematography and musical numbers are great. The three main actors are excellent here, and yes Madonna is surprisingly impressive in this one movie role. Jonathan stands majestic in the role of Juan and Antonio exudes a fervor in the role of Che. Madonna (astonishingly similar to Eva's appearance) is very likeable as Eva, and evokes a very touching moment in singing \\"You Must Love Me\\" when she is aware she will die (oops, spoiler alert?). Webber succeeds in creating wonderfully catchy songs in this production, so even if you don't love this film, you'll enjoy learning an embellished smidgeon of history while tapping your toes.
B0045MPPJK|5.0|I work in an office.  Mind you, I work with a bunch of awesome and easy-going folks.  I'm not in some stuffy bank.  I can't get enough of Die Antwoord.  Their tongue in cheek nature and their not so subtle commentary on South African modern culture is both fascinating and entertaining.  Wow, way to break down an awesome album and make it sound boring.  It's not boring, it is freakin awesome!  But I'm not sure if my suite mates feel the same way with their nasty glares.
B001UV4XUG|3.0|Although the first half of this movie is a bit dull and Joseph GL a bit lifeless, I'm glad I stuck with it. It all comes together at the end in such a grand general statement about human relationships, it felt like an awakening. It is easy to put yourself in his place...after all who hasn't suffered in love. In the sulking phase of sour endings comes the contemplation of making sense of it, the whole point of this film. Being metaphorically slapped in the face makes you wonder why YOU were not 'the one', but alas, the finale may give you a little piece of mind ;)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is ultimately the best game ever.<br />My brothers played it, and now my<br />whole family plays it. I would recommend<br />this game to everybody that owns a<br />Kindle fire. Enjoy!!!
B00BKTFABE|2.0|Not what I expected for a camera.  Would not recommend product. The video and the voice is out of sync.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|As a life-long science fiction fan, Fringe has become my all-time favorite sci-fi television program.  I have seen the first four seasons and am totally addicted.  My only regret is that the show was cancelled after a partial fifth season.
B000V1Z8KK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I love the action scenes and how calm and collected Bob Swagger stays in each situation.
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I love Adam Levine and his voice is to die for. This is more upbeat than Songs About Jane, but still a great collection.
1847940323|5.0|This book should be required reading for everyone who wishes to gain understanding of how their and other individuals minds process and achieve desired objectives at the subconscious level. In so doing one is led to better understanding of how better outcomes may be expected from any endeavor. It is a brilliant discourse, using the analogy of the rider, elephant and instructions to clearly portray how the human mind functions.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next part of the crossfire collection. Gideon is possive, demanding and sexy as hell. The story is a fast read with lots of suspense! I'm anxious for how they move past the huge revelation at the end...
B0018D4SHY|5.0|I was about 7 years old when Little Richard was in his heyday.  My first exposure to him was on TV, maybe on the Johnny Carson show  in the late 60s/early 70s.  He just seemed like some sort of circus clown.  Recently I heard some of his recordings again and I realized the guy was actually pretty good.  So I bought the Very Best of Little Richard  and have come appreciate what a great talent he was; one of the all time great rock n roll singers!  It seems like a lot of later rockers tried to emulate his style but few could  match him.  If you love rock n roll, you need to listen to Little Richard.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked the story and characters. Much more mild than a lot of other stories out there. All in all a good read
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Great film for children and adults alike! I haven't been more excited about an animated film since Finding Nemo came out. Ratatouille is an instant family classic.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Good game. Fairly realistic. I like the challenge of keeping the horse healthy. Also has some cool accessories. I like that training has to be done for the competitions.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|For all of u who can't turn I can fix it. U need to go to settings and turn up your sensitivity!!!
0385470819|5.0|I usually love all his books.  I don't like writing my own, which is why I don't like Writing reviews.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun like I spy but others are right that it runs down energy quickly. Can't earn diamonds very much it seems. Find I can play one or two rounds then have to quit. Still fun though.
0385510438|4.0|Very good and held my attention.  The ending was sad but that's to be expected...I saw it coming.  I would recommend it.
B007Y36K46|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The previews for it were not so great but the film was excellent!
044651652X|5.0|The book was so much better than the movie.  I never knew it was a true story.  I recommended it to all my friends.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Always a favorite, I'm so glad it is available on Amazon Prime so that I can watch the whole series, in order.
B0047VSW30|5.0|This movie was enlightening and, for the most part, historically intertwined in the storyline and the cinematography was absolutely beautiful.  Highly recommended!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|omg school is blown away g o o d j o b . ..<br /> . . . . ha ha
0810989956|5.0|My boys love these books.  They read on their own with zero nagging from me.  What more could I ask for?
B008JFUTT0|5.0|a very good documentary,  unbelivable real story, moving and so optimistic,  great music and songs, historical beckground of second part of 20th century in South Africa, I will recomend it to everybody!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. Ryan Gossling is terrific in his roal. The attention to period detail is amazing. The story line is interesting. I recommend it very much
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app works great on my kindle fire. My daughter loves this game. I recommend this to anyone who loves horses.
B0064QNS62|5.0|Love it. It's very challenging but very very very addicting I can't stop playing it. I love it just too much. Peace out
B004QSQML8|5.0|one of my favorite movies. it maybe alittle cheesy at times. but the costume and sets are some of the most amazing i've ever seen in a movie.
B00BG08FKK|3.0|I love the songs from the move, and I do like the soundtrack. But they have so many cut songs! Why would you take the rest of the first song out? And Fantine's solo in the factory? There was a lot cut out. I would have preferred to pay more and had the option of full songs. As other say, the songs also run into each other. The CD I bought also skips on 3 songs, which I also had trouble downloading because the disc is messed up. I love everything on this, but I am very annoyed that I can't hear the rest of the songs they cut out unless I watch the movie. I hope they will make a deluxe deluxe edition. But since it appears they won't be doing that, this would be the only album worth buying. I loved the music, but was disappointed with this album.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Love this series. OHHH WHY DID THEY HAVE TO CANCEL IT!! but really fun sci-fi story very underrated any sci-fi could enjoy
B00991TCOG|5.0|This album is great. Lindsey is unique and very talented. I like all the songs; they are all different but all of them sound awesome. I also bought some of her single tracks like Phantom of the Opera and Zelda, and I will be looking for more albums from her in the future!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game must add :D love the graphics and the leveling system overall great visuals and stunning game play<br />Buy it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series! Worth watching every episode. Watched season one and now need to see season three to get caught up.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like another Bingo game I have.  This is one that you get special treatment if you go on Facebook etc.  I am not interested in doing that
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is on my k fire and aneroid. very convenient when traveling or just when I have a short time to read the Bible.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I like games that take a while to play and so far I have had this one for 3 days. Only downside is that it is hard to touch the arrows just right so that it moves you to the next scene.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such a great tale, or set of tales, of a beautiful place. Somewhere that should be dark and dreary and hopeless but somehow isn't. Highly recommended.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Amazing acting. Very believable writing, the dresses, the scenery, the plot(s), Mr.Bates...Downton Abbey supports the old saying 'there's a bit of bad in the best of us and a bit of good in the worst of us'.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|very good reading but nicholas sparks is always good, and ill keep reading his books. Think I have read all of his books!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great graphics and a fun story line!  Would recommend for all ages.  Only complaint is that the touch screen was sometimes slow to react.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a really good app. I love being in control of my own town and I love this game. it really keeps you busy!!
1936608898|5.0|I considered myself a healthy person before I started eating Paleo. I consumed lots of whole grains, fruits, some veggies. I worked out. I was in the \\"normal\\" BMI body range. But I noticed my belly \\"pooch\\" was getting worse...my pants that were NEVER tight in the past started to give me a muffin top...and I was so addicted to sugar that I knew I had to do something about it. I started my quest for weight loss by using My Fitness Pal and tracking every single thing I ate, and I couldn't do it. I kept eating too much and I was getting depressed about the situation. A friend suggested AdvoCare to me, and I knew that if I was going to do this, I was NOT going to take some sort of supplement or shake...I was going to do it the natural way. So I started reading around.<br /><br />I first read \\"Wheat Belly.\\" The concept of cutting out all wheat and most grains made me mad and I decided it wasn't for me. I was roaming Pinterest one day and saw a before/after pic of a girl with a body like mine- athletic, thin, but with a pooch (before), and after, she had a flat stomach- because she did the Whole 30 challenge. I bought the book and was shocked that it had many of the same ideas presented in Wheat Belly, but hearing the info from another source (and one that sounded a LOT friendlier/less doctor-ish than the author of Wheat Belly), I was more open to what was being said. I got very excited to try the challenge and slowly cut grains and things out of my diet until my start date. And then...the challenge began.<br /><br />The idea behind the book is that the foods we consume cause constant inflammation in the body. With constant inflammation, you can never truly heal, and the effects just keep compounding in the form of the various medical distresses we all face. In W30, you cut all grains, legumes (I was sad to lose peanut butter), and dairy. That means no butter, milk, or cheese- my trifecta of awesomeness- but I was willing to let it go. It was *only* 30 days.<br /><br />Looking back, it really wasn't hard at all. I never underwent withdrawal like some people do, and I credit that to the fact that I slowly removed \\"no no\\" foods from my diet. I never felt undernourished- I actually ate MORE. I used to hate vegetables, but now I can honestly say that I love them. I expanded my tastes and have tried so many new things due to this challenge. Other benefits of the challenge- 1) I completely lost all belly bloat. You know how your stomach puffs out after a huge meal? Yah, doesn't happen when you eat this way. You can be SO full and your stomach is still flat- it's amazing! 2) MORE ENERGY. This is a consistent statement among people who do W30. By cutting all those things out, you keep your blood sugar levels regular, so you do not have any crashes. You have steady energy all. day. It's incredible. 3) I feel better about myself and I am much happier all the time. I swear this helped me kick my depression. I feel so good all the time and my self-confidence has skyrocketed. 4) I didn't happen to lose any weight on the scale, but my pants fit better, my belly is flatter (not perfect, but definitely less jiggly), and again, I am more confident about my body. I know weight loss was my initial goal, but I stopped caring after I realized that my health is measured in so many other ways! (and my pants fit again, yay!)<br /><br />During the middle of the challenge, I had a panic moment- how could I give up pasta, bread, etc, FOREVER? My grandpa died at the age of 93- a full-blooded Italian who ate TONS of pasta and bread all the time- so why couldn't I??? But at the end of the challenge, when I realized how GOOD I felt with all of those foods removed...I was changed for life. I now follow the rules of Paleo 80-90% of the time. The most non-Paleo thing I do is dairy. I love cheese and I'm not willing to give that up, and I also love butter (I buy both organic now though, which I never did before). I did change my milk habits, though- I  used to go through a gallon a week by myself, and I don't even buy it anymore. I'm not sad to have \\"lost\\" grains or legumes or milk...I'm actually very satisfied. I will have those things as a treat now and then, but I'm NEVER going back to the way I used to eat.<br /><br />If you decide to do the challenge, coconut will be your best friend. Stock up on coconut oil and canned coconut milk (best prices at Trader Joe's- 5.99 for the oil and 0.99 for the light milk). You will most likely consume lots of eggs and nuts. And when you need to \\"bread\\" something, you'll probably use almond meal (again, best price at TJ's- 3.99 for 1lb. You seriously cannot get that price anywhere else).<br /><br />My advice: get this book. They describe the science behind it all in a non-wordy way that everyone can understand. They back up their claims with tons of research. And the best evidence? Look at all the reviews and how this book has changed the lives of so many people, including me. Your health is worth it. And remember...it's *only* 30 days...that's not too terribly long. Once you get into it, you'll realize it's not as hard as it seems (and if you're stuck with meals, use Pinterest- tons of W30 boards out there- and the book Well Fed- so many great W30 compliant recipes).<br /><br />Give it a try- you might like the results :).ugh a gallon a week by myself, and I don't even buy it anymore.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I personally love this thing. Accurate to the prop until you get to the buttons and the cracked Porcelain effect but both can be fixed with shoe polish paint and what not. I'm really into modding so i plan to modify mine so the slider is the button and get rid of the original buttons entirely. to do that i suggest you tube and imagination. over-all awesome toy and as is great prop. oh but dont run/jump around or it will suicide jump out of your pocket and break. I know thats the whole point but make sure you've got it secured so that doesnt happen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Dimonds are very hard to find but i would give the game billion stars please buy the game if you have minecraft buy this one too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-_-
B0000508U6|5.0|I actually bought this CD for my niece. She was so happy to have her favorite CD.. I think is a good gift and also a cheap one for your wallet.. Win win win!!!
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|Wonderful cd.  I recommend this highly.  Sing choices are absolutely beautiful.  You will not be disappointed.bocelli has so much soul
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Justin Timberlake. Enough said! He's an amazing artist! This music in this album reminds me a lot of Robin Thicke
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like subway surfers! It is updated regularly, always proving an excellent  gaming experience! Subway surfers is my favourite game and can be enjoyed by all, especially those with a competitive streak!:)
B002SSUQFG|4.0|this watch has everything that I could want from a watch.  I can tell both the time and the date and if I have an extra second or two, the day!  So far I have only had to pop the band back onto the watch-face two times, but since both of those instances were caused by me, I am saying that as a fact, not a complaint.<br />overall, a solid purchase.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game it keeps me into it. I could play this game for my whole life. The only thing that is bad about it is that you can't stop playing it and my mom or dad yells at me. But that is the only bad thing about it.  IT IS SO COOL!!!!!
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|The Living Infinite is nothing short of magical. This is the best album I've heard in a long time. 5 stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game  I love how u get 2 go 2 different places n da world!!! Get this game u won't regretted EVER!!!!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Finally a show that's outside the norm.  Love the actors and the plot from week to week.  Can't wait for season 4
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Normally I never write reviews but like others have said the ending is a total let down. If the ending had matched the great climax from the book I would have given it a 5 star, but with the ending making it only 3. Honestly, the ending betrays the trilogy and my love for the books, and I wish the series would have ended on a better scenario.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This tale has it all--mystery, endearing while somewhat puzzling characters, subtle wry observations of human relationships and human/technology relationships, a sense of place and time both past and present,  but most of all a  good story with a satisfying ending. Aaaaaaah..... Although technology has changed, human nature has not and ultimately this is what is revealed. One other thing will never change, good writing and the enjoyment it provides in Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It is a good app because it tells you your battery percentage and give you a lot of other information
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|It's a pretty good album. At least 4 good songs on it. I might not recommend this one for the elderly.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Perfect game for when you need to kill some time in between your appointments or busy day.  Great game, good graphics and very smooth.  Use it all the time.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|like this game!  it is fun with different puzzles correlating with story.  ended too soon.  will be taste testing other games from this developer.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I purchased the DB-Tech scanner primarily to digitize about 500 slides from a 1993 trip to Poland.  I will also use it to digitize negatives from as long ago as 1970 or so.  Thus far I have scanned about 50 slides, no negatives.  Consider this a preliminary review.  If anything changes my opinion substantially I will edit the review.<br /><br />The scanner was well-packaged and seemingly complete except that there was no manual; Amazon description indicates that there should be one, but it is not listed on the box.  The lack of a manual is a serious oversight, as without it the user is lost.  Fortunately the Amazon reviews have provided sufficient information that I could figure out what I needed to do.  For example - the scanner seems to default (each time you turn it on) to the 5 megapixel mode - most users indicate that the 10 megapixel mode is better, but I would not have known about the 10 megapixel mode or how to access it without the reviews here on Amazon.  Navigation among the various menus on the scanner is not intuitive (for example, what does the \\"Music\\" option do?) - a manual would have helped in this regard as well.  I am not inclined to return to device to Amazon because of the missing manual - I will try to get one directly from DB, but finding info about them online is remarkably difficult; it appears that I cannot simply download a manual.<br /><br />The missing manual is not the basis for my 4-star review - a review that to me means the item is good but not excellent.  So far I have been impressed by the quality of the scans; they're not great, and would not enlarge to high-quality prints, but for web viewing they are fine.  The scanner is certainly easy to use (once you figure out the menus) - I scanned 50 slides in less than one hour and most of the time was spent removing the slides from the protective sheets in which I have stored them.  I took a star away primarily for these reasons:<br /><br />- I would like the device to default to the highest setting, or at least to store the settings that I prefer after I turn it off.  Apparently this is not possible, so on each power-up I have to remember to set it to 10 Mb (at least I think I'm setting it to 10 Mb; the interface does not make clear which option is selected: items change color, but which of the two [the darker or the lighter] is the one that I selected?).<br /><br />- The slot for slides easily accommodates normal cardboard mounts.  Unfortunately I have some slides in plastic mounts that are a bit thicker, wider, and longer.  Some of these do not fit in the slot.  A slightly larger slot would have been nice.  Needle-nose pliers, as recommended by others, are very useful here.<br /><br />- The device allows a slide to be flipped left-right or up-down. This is useful. Slides that are oriented vertically must be inserted sideways (that is, the scanning area is in \\"landscape\\" mode, which does not work for a \\"portrait\\" mode slide.  Having the option to rotate an image 90 degrees when saving would be a nice feature.  I can easily do this in post-processing, so perhaps I expect too much from an inexpensive scanner.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'm happy with the scanner.  It is not perfect, but it is inexpensive and it works for my purposes. I would recommend it to others.<br /><br />EDITED: Thanks to the first comment below I now have a manual. With the manual, I have learned that there is indeed an option to rotate an image, so rotating the portrait-style image in my computer is not longer necessary.  The manual indicates that the 10 megapixel setting is the default.  This still is not entirely clear to me when I view the menu on the device. And despite listing the MUSIC mode as one of 6 modes available, the manual does not tell me what it does.  No change to my 4-star rating, but having the manual makes use easier.

B009NCM248|5.0|I can't get a few of the songs out of my head AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO!  It blows my mind how Corey Taylor's voice can be pure raw hard aggression and then it switches to so gosh......soulfully melodic.  Like I could cry.  With that kind of talent it allows me to really hear the lyrics therefore  I'm 200% more &#34;into&#34; the song-album-band.<br /><br />This album is kick ass
B008PZZV8S|3.0|Predictable ending and dull story telling.  Nothing wrong with the acting.  Problem is with the poor script.  The suspense is too contrived.
B0064QNS62|2.0|Got it as Amazon FAOTD and even though free, there's better apps for the price. It's ok, but didn't seem fun enough for me to be worth the time invested... Your mileage my vary. He looks like Mario and even the pickaxe works just like Mario's hammer in Donkey Kong (swings continuously for a few seconds then disappears, for those not familiar with the old school arcade game). The most annoying part to me was when you die by falling to a platform a little too far down. Not off the screen, just like halfway down. Supposed to be realistic I guess; like random fire jets, vanishing pickaxes, and bombs that blow up monsters but not you... LoL. An oldschool platformer is welcome but I think you can fall farther in real life without being crushed.<br /><br />Bottom line... Just OK in a world where there are tons of good games for cheap or free.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|I am glad I didn't pay big bucks to see this in the theater.  Just as the rest of the futuristic fiction genre, it is full of holes.  The mix between the technology of the future as displayed in the movie and the apparent wealth of the controlling class with the poverty class from what looks like the sixteenth century is incredible.  Story and plot was obviously written by a juvenile with fertile imagination and yet misguided understanding of science as well as the humanities.<br />On the one hand, there appears to be a lot of advanced science and technology among the rich in the future and yet the ruling class is not smart enough to feed the poor.  On the other hand, the wicked rich who have lost their hearts and minds can still effect some sporadic kindness and mercy so that our chosen heroine can have a chance to survive along with her admiring competitor.  Well, I almost want to hug the &#34;bad guys&#34;.  They are the real underdogs in the race to eternity.  They did &#34;good&#34; and not because they had to in order to survive the show.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not put it down!<br />Anyone who likes mystery, intrigue, romance, science fiction it's all here!<br />I can't write this review fast enough so that I can get the other books in the series!
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Positively entertaining.  Good plot lines and believable acting.  The only movies that can be better would be ones based on true stories.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Fortunately I saw the movie before reading the book so I knew what was happening without having to read all the verbage. Hugo goes on and on about the smallest thing which caused me to skip whole chapters. I found it very tiring. I was not interested in learning more about the Napoleonic wars. Once I read a name I recognized, I would start reading from that point. I liked Hugo's writing style.

0446541478|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I had read in years. The stuff in it really blew my mind. The authors did a great job in telling why Israel excels in such a relatively short volume with excellent writing and organising skills. In short, highly recommended! Though I dont think Israel's political rivals and business competitors can emulate much, their horizons will be broadened and thinking will be improved.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.<br />What is said about Jews - two Jews, three opinions - is certainly true of Israelis. Pg32<br />It's more complicated to manage five Israelis than fifty Americans because the Israelis will challenge you all the time - starting with \\"why are you my manager; why am I not your manager?\\" - 40<br />Judaism and Israel have always cultivated \\"a culture of doubt and argument, an open-ended game of interpretations, counter-interpretations, reinterpretations, opposing interpretations. Pg51<br />Innovation often depends on having a different perspective. Perspective comes from experience. Real experience also typically comes with age or maturity. But in Israel, you get experience, perspective, and maturity at a younger age, because the society jams so many transformative experiences into Israelis when they're barely out of high school. Pg74<br />The military gets you at a young age and teaches you that when you are in charge of something, you are responsible for everything that happens....and everything that does not happen. The phrase \\"It was not my fault\\" does not exist in the military culture. Pg78<br />The US typically uses four waves of specialized aircraft to accomplish a specific component of the mission: for e.g. a combat air patrol, designed to clear a corridor of enemy aircraft; a second wave that knocks out any enemy antiaircraft systems that are firing missiles; a third wave of electronic warfare aircraft, tankers for refueling, and radar aircraft to provide a complete battle pictures; and finally, the strikers themselves - planes with bombs. ...It's very challenging logistically. You've got to meet the tanker at the right place. You've got to rendezvous with the electronic warfare - if one guy's off by a few seconds, it all falls apart....In the Israeli system, almost every aircraft is a jack of all trades. You don't go into combat without air to air missiles, no matter what the mission is....each pilot learns not only his own target but also other targets in separate formations. If an aircraft gets hit, for e.g., and two aircraft split off to go after a downed pilot or to engage in air to air combat...the other pilots have to take over those targets. Pg186-7<br />If price is a cluster's only competitive edge, some other country will always come along to do it more cheaply. The other qualitative elements - such as tight-knit communities whose members are committed to living and working and raising families in the cluster - are what contribute to sustainable growth. Crucially, a cluster's sense of shared commitment and destiny, which transcends day to day business rivalries, is not easy to manufacture. Pg201<br />Core purpose is the organization's fundamental reason for being. It reflects the importance people attach to the company's work...beyond just making money. Collins describes Israel's core purpose as \\"to provide a secure place on Earth for the Jewish people. pg204<br />Israel has something that's sought by other countries - even countries that are considered on the forefront of global competitiveness. In addition to the institutional elements that make up clusters - which Finland, Singapore, and Korea already possess -what's missing gin these other countries is a cultural core built on a rich stew of aggressiveness and team orientation, on isolation and connectedness, and on being small and aiming big. Pg230<br />If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples, then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas. - George Bernard Shaw pg233. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas. - George Bernard Shaw pg233

B00AG6Z92C|5.0|a great talent to be enjoyed by all.  Especially my girl friend whom I got for, she loves it.  Thats good enugh for me.
0545259088|4.0|If you have read Shiver than I'm sure it left you wanting more. This book Forever is the last book in the 3 book series Shiver, Linger, and Forever. It is definitely different from twilight, there are no vampires, however like Twilight it is a love story. This book appeals to ages 12 and up. My daughter read shiver and then had to have the next book linger and when forever came out of course we had to complete the series. I think Shiver was her favorite and she has even read the book more than once. Forever, in her opinion was not as good as the first two books and it did leave the ending to your imagination. All in all, I thought it was a good read and if you have read the first two books I don't think you would be disappointed. Also, if considering as a gift or for a daughter I do feel it is age appropriate for 12 and up.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is going back in the vaults later this month (along with The Lion King) so get this classic now!

B005ER6STG|1.0|This movie isn't what i thought it would be.  OMGoodness!  After I watched it, I cut it up and threw it away.  Actually, I think that &#34;they&#34; should not sell this movie anymore and take it off the shelfs.  Horrible!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|iThis is one of the best SciFi series ever made for tv. Much better then the X files, the Event, Falling Skies or Lost.<br />The acting is surprisingly good with the father Walter Bishop having the most excellent character part and the best lines ever. This show often seems familiar but with more twists and great effects - the creepy parts are visceral and the smart parts are thoughtfully constructed, yet somehow the director managed to add lots of funny lines all going to the father, Walter Bishop. This group includes British actor Jared Harris from Mad Men, as the best evil bad guy ever. If you enjoy quality story telling give this a watch. But watch it without commercials.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It's fun, keeps the mind sharp.  Would recommend to anyone of any age.  My grandchildren  would even play it and they are all different ages.
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Highly recommend it. It helped my son understand his friend with autism more. :-) inspiring movie of a great woman
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|It is an excellent film.  I enjoyed every moment of it.  The only problem is that it ended.  I had hoped that there would be no conclusion:  But, of course, an ending is inevitable.  Please inform Robert Downey and Jude Law that a third (and others) will be welcomed each time it or they are offered to the public.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Fast paced and fun. Could not anticipate what was about to happen. On to book three. Cant wait for the movies
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|I enjoyed all of the action scenes. The story keeps you interested and there is never a dull moment in this movie.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Based on the story of the Tuskeegee airman of WW2 is a more modernized version of the first version of this movie, still worth adding to your DVD collection in my opinion
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|What can I say! I'm a big fan of the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit is just as wonderful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best game we  have played next to angrybirds . This game is wonderful for me and my son we compete constantly. We have actually givin angrybirds a break to play this.You just cant play it once and put it down.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Nice story, love the animation.  And I gave the two eggs to my niece and nephew for Easter.  Great color.
B00A69JZQU|4.0|Good structure and content. Explains how to align social media usage to strategy. A good resource for those needing to understand the business implications and appropriate tools.
0312370849|4.0|We chose this book for our bookclub pick.  I learned alot about France's role in the Holocaust that I didn't know.  However, I thought the end of the book was a bit slow.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Ken Follett is a wonderful storyteller, although I was offended by the usage of four-letter words in the book.  I am not naive, and I am sure during wartimes that four-letter words are prolific, but I still believe that the deletion of curse words would not have &#34;hurt&#34; the sale of the book.<br />I read his first book and loved it as well.  Still waiting for the third book, and I will read it, but will wince on every four-letter word!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Funny, exciting, clever. The Brits don't bore with the idea that everyone must have a pretty face to be in series tv. Characters have depth.

B00BC0JI6O|5.0|This is the infusion the mighty \\"beard\\" needed! Ted Leonard brings along his great vocals and superb song-writing skills, and Jimmy Keegan fills the hole left by Nick D'Virgilio. This release has it all-great Enchant like gems- \\"Submerged\\" and \\"Hiding Out\\" and Neal Morse co-written beauties- \\"Afterthoughts\\" and \\"Waiting For Me\\". John Boeghold contributes his usual stellar writing in \\"Down a Burning Road\\" and \\"A Treasure Abandoned\\". Alan Morse, Dave Meros and Ryo are all in top form. There is a newfound energy in the band and a more airwave \\"friendly\\" sound at times. Highly recommended!
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Nothing fancy and so far works well.  Was able to set it up with no problems.  It is missing a fine control to adjust the record speed just right but so far I am happy with it.
B005HHSYMW|5.0|This book made me think, and feel hopeful about the future. We may lament the loss of the good old days, but Professor Pinker shows they weren't so good after all. Often in the past people would lash out violently with little provocation because the law permitted such behavior. Attitudes towards violence and the law have changed and we are all better for it. Don't believe me? Read the book.

1616550414|5.0|This book is definitely a must-have for any Legend of Zelda fan. It has the never-before-seen official timeline including all the games and some details in-between that you're sure to find interesting. The book also contains a lot of original concept art and production and design notes, offering a look into the design process for different characters and locations. All in all, a very good read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Rather bizarre story. Well-written and carefully crafted mystery, just didn't like the characters. I read this for a book club and should make for an interesting discussion!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun game that has challenges, especially if you don't buy any power ups.  I have completed all levels and am now going back and trying to get all levels to highest score.. 3 stars or more.  It hasn't been easy.  this is a very time-consuming and challenging game and can be fun for kids and adults.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this teenage dramedy. There are so many things that resonate with my high school experience; just when you think you have some part of your life together, everything gets messed up in a very public way. It reminds me of how I always felt everyone saw my goofs or were talking about me as a teen and it also makes me think about how difficult it must be in this age of technology for the average teen, much less one who is a little different from the &#34;in crowd&#34;. I look forward to seeing more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I generally do not play video games but I am totally addicted to Subway Suffers. I play the game every chance I get.

B00BFBSV72|5.0|This is an AMAZING Game! I recommend it to all Sonic Fanatics such as me! XD<br />You can play as Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Blaze, Silver, Amy, and Rouge which have their own Special Abilities! Best Game on the Kindle Fire so far! (My Opinion)

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle delivers Broadway the way it should be heard.  So glad to support her great musical talent.  Go Susan!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This series started well and even the beginning of the season started well. It has become very muddied and confusing at this point and I am disappointed with where it is going. Emma needs to become the strong character that she should be. And there needs to be some revisiting of Belle's & Aurora's (& Mulan's) storylines.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! I've seen Temple on TED.com and Claire Danes plays her exceptionally well. It's wonderful to see a movie about Autism that shows Autism as a difference rather than a disability. A must watch!!!!!
B00BI745AA|4.0|we watched this as a family and I thought it was very good, worth seeing.  we had not previously seen the musical
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece collection.  I had seen only a couple of episodes on public television before I decided that the entire set was worth purchasing.  Excellent drama that keeps ones attention is sometimes difficult to find.  This is a classic, and the many  interwoven stories are sure to please the discriminating viewer.
B0019GO58C|5.0|This is a story of two people, ostensibly happily married, who meet by chance on a city-bound commuter train and slowly begin to fall in love. Their responsible  core values are inconsistent with quick sex and, accordingly, this type of intimacy evades them as they inexorably fall in love, realizing that they were meant to be only with each other. Their marriage values translates into guilt, as their respective marriages, now barren of love, fall apart and they put geography between them. But an unplanned meeting at the place of their first encounter revives their mutual love in a heart-stopping final scene in which they are determined to let nothing stand in their way again. I find myself watching the ending again and again, so strong is its impact. Beautifully acted and directed, this did not receive its deserved acclaim. The plot-raised issues strike at the heart of fated contact between two decent people who find themselves FALLING IN LOVE. This is a vastly underrated film. It deserves the description of \\"GREAT.\\"
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Great movie!  Beautifully done.  Anne Hathaway was AMAZING!  a definite must - see.  Can't wait to see how the show at Queen's Theater in London measures up!
B0074MZSWW|2.0|I bought this album for the song Hold On. I was very upset that there is a blip in the recording at the 2:59 minute mark. In addition, there is a horrible buzzing sound near the end of the song. I thought maybe it was just my CD but when I listened to it through the Amazon cloud player is was there as well. This must be some defect with the original recording. One would think this would have been taken care of before the album was released.
B0064J6OMO|4.0|Good movie. I would recommend it to friends. Its a fun movie to watch with your significant other - kind of a &#34;chick flick&#34;, but kept my husband entertained.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This type of puzzle was a little confusing at first.  I have had it awhile and play it regularly.  I find some of it easy but am always challenged.
B000SEGSB8|5.0|What a learning experience. This is a history of which most all readers are a part. It connects time periods, experiences, and political decisions with one's own lifetime. Then it draws you into a wider movement, a more comprehensive social and political picture, and provides a scope behind any one boundary (be it time, nation, people, language, or political belief.<br /><br />And it is really well written. A most enjoyable read. We lost a great mind when Tony Judt died, this is an amazing tale.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The Eagles are seasoned (talents honed!) and sound better than ever!  With Blu-Ray, 100 inch screen, and surround sound, this Eagles fan is in heaven.  Thirty great songs, and they made sure that their voices and guitars were reproduced on this disc with high quality digital sound and picture.  If you enjoy remembering how you felt in the 70's, listen to the Eagles!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Couldn't stop watching episodes . Inside  life of lawyers life. So much more than to the process ,still watching the episodes .
B004J4WNL2|4.0|ok, I have to admit it: I'm an introverts, kind of, and I like the way she approached the topic and explain very well, so well that even extrovert may enjoy this book.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|I really like this movie. It went along with the book for the most part. I like that they use some of the same sets from the Lord of the Rings.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|It's crap. I bought it 5 months ago in Nov. 2012 and now the zipper doesn't work. I would recommend a case with velcro.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book.  Had a little more variety in the plot than usual.  Nice character development.  Smooth read.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I did not like it. It was hard to see arroind you and hard to make hard to make your guy turn arround.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Very intriguing show. The acting is always top-notch. Glad I can watch it on premium. Trying to be faithful to herself, her family and her husband.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have this game on every portable device I own.  Very relaxing.  Prizes are awarded like real time.  Would love to see Coin Dozed Halloween made available for my Kindle.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great songs. Love how he uses a lot of bands and instruments in a lot of his songs. Awesome come back and very much worth buying
1594484805|4.0|As a homeschooling, self employed person, this book didn't come as a huge surprise, but it is one that I really enjoyed. I suspect it is because this is a book that sets down on paper what your gut has been telling you for years.<br /><br />Drawing on decades of research and numerous commercial case studies, Daniel Pink unpacks and refutes the notion that the carrot and stick approach is an optimal approach to management. Pink asserts that while financial incentives may provide an initial motivational spike, to achieve long term results you need to look to less tangible incentives like autonomy, mastery and purpose. He looks in particular at the business models that have emerged over the last decade that are throwing standard approaches out the window. While he asserts that people have baseline financial needs, business models like open source software or Wikipedia provide a window to a world where people are driven by a whole new set of motivators.<br /><br />As someone who reads a lot about education models and approaches, much of what Pink has to say rang true. But what I found really interesting was the range of 'standard practises' that he, scientists and companies are now beginning to question because not only do they fail to motivate staff, but are being shown to increase attrition rates, and lower corporate performance - things like billable hours for lawyers and commission payments for sales teams.<br /><br />What's inspiring about the case studies is seeing the evolution of ideas like working from home. Pink provides some fascinating research on the rise of 'homeshoring' by companies looking at alternatives to relocating their call centres offshore. Rather than looking solely at tapping into cheap labour, homeshoring looks to access a workforce that is effectively off the business grid - people like mothers, retirees, or those with disabilities who require a greater flexibility in their working environment. If you've ever been one of those off the grid types, you won't be surprised to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is that it is confined to conventional workplaces. There's considerable scope to take the ideas and research outlined here and explore them in the context of the current generation of entrepreneurs and self employed. The world of homeschooling also provides a whole other case study for a study of motivation. (It doesn't take a homeschooling parent long to realise that the threat of suspending a student from school carries little weight!)<br /><br />This book is really worth a read, but if you would prefer a quick snapshot of the basic principles, check out Pink's Ted Talk on the subject.<br /><br />[...]ed to hear that this new workforce is better educated - around 70-80% of homeshored customer service agents are college educated - and is consistently delivering a higher quality service than the conventional approach, whilst still being cost effective.

B000WC3864|1.0|Man, I got the Special Collector's Edition of The Evil Dead tonight<br />and got through maybe 30 minutes of it before giving up.  First of all<br />I'm a longtime serious horror fan and writer/critic/author in the field<br />for nearly 30 years and I somehow missed The Evil Dead when it first<br />came out, probably because I was just too young to get into a theater<br />to see it.  I'm also a massive Lovecraft and weird fiction scholar, fan,<br />and expert in the field, which is another reason I was interested in finally<br />seeing it due to the alleged Lovecraftian elements.<br /><br />I happen to be a massive George Romero fan (I've written an entry/essay for the<br />Supernatural Literature of the World Encyclopedia on his classic film MARTIN)<br />because I feel his early films in particular deliver the gore and the scares with more intelligence<br />and craftsmanship than most horror directors.  I never warmed to directors like Raimi, Wes Craven,<br />and a lot of the others (Stuart Gordon, Fulci as well, a schlockmeister at best) that so<br />many of my peers and fellow horror nuts seem to worship slavishly.  I don't.<br />This movie SUCKS. It might've seemed scary or good when I was 15 or whatever<br />but all it did was bore and annoy me trying to watch it now.  I always pretty<br />much felt the same way about most slasher type horror films even though I know<br />this one is not quite merely a slasher/teen body count type film.  I never<br />was a huge fan of Friday the 13th either, barely so of Halloween and only then<br />because the once-great John Carpenter was the man behind it.<br /><br />Sorry, The Evil Dead wasn't even good for the Lovecraft influences which<br />prove to be so lame and bastardized in this film that it doesn't even make it<br />worth watching for HPL fans to catch any mention of the Necronomicon which it's<br />not even actually CALLED in the film (although the DVD box copy claims it is).<br />Or maybe I've just outgrown thesetypes of films, or some of the lower common<br />denominator of the horror genre, which both could also be true.  All I know<br />is, if I want a quality horror film I'll watch The Shining (warts and all),<br />ALIEN, The Exorcist, Dawn of the Dead (original), Christine, Burnt Offerings,<br />ANYTHING but this wretched low budget bomb from 1982.  I also had similar feelings about The Hills Have<br />Eyes: when I was in summer camp when it first came out everyone was like<br />oh Scott it's so scary you'll have a heart attack if you see it but of course<br />I didn't cause I was too young at the time, obviously, and then<br />when I finally watched a good deal of it on IFC a few years back, unedited,<br />IT SUCKED.<br /><br />Why people think these are good films is beyond me.  I know you<br />have to take into account that they are low-budget indie. productions,<br />that goes without saying, but so what, if the film is lame it's lame,<br />no matter what the budget.  I also heard years ago the hype that The Evil<br />Dead was so ahead of its time, so intense and X-rated (or nearly so) in its<br />graphic horror, and ultraviolent and not for the squeamish and it's not even close to those<br />descriptions.  False advertising, even for 1982.  They spouted the same<br />nonsense for Dawn of the Dead and that was intense but was also mainly<br />marketing/promotional b.s. As for Evil Dead, it's mainly just predictable<br />hackwork and boring as all get out.  Even Friday the 13th #1 or #2 have<br />more surprises and original scares than The Evil Dead.  Ho hum. And I generally HATE<br />those stupid movies.<br /><br />Sorry, The Evil Dead didn't do it for me.  It's going back in its case<br />and back into the basement!  Fast!  And this is dedicated to the spirit of<br />master film critic Roger Ebert (and Gene Siskel too), just for kicks. I really do think of Roger<br />everytime I write anything, especially on film.  Now you'll excuse me as I go put<br />my \\"pretentious\\" film fanatic hat back on and go watch some Louis Malle films.  Well,<br />at least I'm sure it won't be four wasted hours with any of his stuff!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm not a gamer, but wanted a better mouse than the HP stock unit. $40 is a little steep for my limited purpose - but it's worth it. Excellent size, build quality, and ergonomics. Bonus is the cool blue lights (can be configured to any color).
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Mid way through the book I was intrigued by the author.  My mind kept asking:  what kind of person can write so powerfully and beautifully at the same time?  And when I learned that the book is autobiographical in several respects, I was even more amazed.<br /><br />This was one of those rare books that one wishes would never end.  I would recommend Shantaram to everyone.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I though it was a really good rental, lots of funny parts and some reality scenes.  A good rental for adults.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I love all the resident evil movies and games this in just as great as the others!! great watch and value.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What a great show from cable.  Had to catch up with the season.  I wish it would be more about the zombies and looking for a cure, than war between people.  Hope they move on with the storyline away from the two groups and go into the disease more.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|Great ghost sytle movie for the supernatural lovers out there no gore but great!!!<br />this is up there with Rose Red
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It took me two days to read this book but that's only because I had to pause to work ! Loved it and I'm fixing to start reading the second one !!!
0446530573|5.0|I've tried several recipes in this book and I loved them!  The book is easy to follow and the food is delicious. I didn't know wonderful Italian could be so simple. Thanks, Artie Bucco!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|It's a shame some people have had trouble installing this app.  I successfully installed it on my Kindle Fire HD and completed it with a perfect 3-star score.  I played it twice -once to get familiar with the game and the second time to perfect the score on each country.  It took me about a week, though.  This game is addictive, frustrating, hair pulling, you name it.<br />The biggest obstacles I found were the &quot;automatic&quot; moves which many times messed with the ones I had planned ahead making me take longer on finishing the country, and at some point it erased three countries I had already completed with the 3 stars.  I think their expectations of most people's abilities to get 3 stars on every country is very high and I wonder how many people  have achieved these results.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Mary Poppins is such a classic movie!  I was so excited to add this to my collection recently.  Full of wonderful song & dance scenes and magical adventures!  Will have you humming and whistling for days to come.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|this dvd was just as good if not better than the first one...purchased for my granddaughter and she just loved it..has watched twice..great price too
B008XJ8WE6|4.0|This is one of my husbands favorite musicals of all time so I purchased it for his birthday this year.  It did take about a month to ship to us in Alaska (It shipped through Belgium!), so it didn't make it for his birthday but we still really enjoyed it when it arrived.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Great writing, but no where near as action packed as book 3.  A lot of wondering through the wilderness, literally a figuratively.  So just be prepared to accept it for what it is-- basically a hangover from everything happend in Book 3.  Also, NO TYRION.
B000FC12C8|4.0|I would recommend this book for anyone trying to understand the stock market and invest for the long run. .
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|My father always said that success went to the man who built the better mouse trap..this is the better mouse trap. The game is the same but how it it is presented is truly an advancement. It is quick , attractive, and more engaging. Try it you will love it. Beware, dead mice every place!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|OMG this game is amazing it is so addictive I can't stop playing it!!! It's kind of hard at first but then you get the hang of it! I love it! It  is so much fun!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I had not read a John Grisham nivel in a while and was pleasantly surprised to see how he can still maintain the story fun and thrilling
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is amazing. You won't ever ever want to put it down. It becomes even more addicting when you sign in with Facebook and challenge your friends to the top of the leader board. All in all, one of the greatest games out there... AND IT'S FREE!!
