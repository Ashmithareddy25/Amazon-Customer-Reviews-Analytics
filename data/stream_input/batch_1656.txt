B0050DIWFC|3.0|Although I wanted to like this book, and I think it had a very interesting premise, I can only give it a lukewarm review.  I found the characters very hard to like, especially Andy Barber.  He was portrayed as being intelligent and expert at his job as an attorney, yet his actions were beyond stupid. Although he feared for his son's future, and he obviously loved him, Andy continuously used poor judgement.  As a woman, I found his reflections on his wife to be demeaning and petty.  Before I'd finished a third of the story, I found Andy to be shallow and self-centered.  The court scenes dragged on and on; I just wanted to get to the end.  Was the end really surprising?  I didn't think so. Landay had the makings of a great story, but I felt it lacked character development and that he tried to tackle too many issues ~ not tying it together.

B005OCFGTO|1.0|Ok - so the Region 1 set is over 70 USD but if you order the Region 2 set it is only 32 USD (s&h brings it up to 40 USD)!<br /><br />Come on Amazon. What is the deal?<br /><br />Def. makes me want to go out and buy an \\"all regions\\" DVD or Blue Ray player.<br /><br />While I do not plan on buying either Region 1 or Region 2 set I am posting this to notify Amazon customers that they are ripping off folks for the Region 1 set.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|It loses calibration very often.  Even after locking the bolts, calibration will drift frequently.  Not recommended for serious videographers.  Your index and thumb will go numb from the hours and hours of adjusting the balance.<br /><br />mark iii + 24-105.  maybe i just have a very heavy setup.  but it doesn't exceed the weight restriction....<br /><br />****UPDATE January 15, 2013****<br />Changed from 2 stars to 5 stars.  Here's why:<br /><br />WOW. a day's worth of patience and 2 weddings later pays off!  I've used the glidecam for 2 weddings now and the results are phenomenal.  Once you get the thing balanced, it's easy to pop on/off the camera.  you just have to adjust the balancing weights using the knob and the left/right adjustment knob.<br /><br />My only problem with this glidecam is that you can't mount a quick release plate due to the lack of clearance for the security lock.  I was trying to mount a Manfrotto Quick Release Plate for my RC2.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a solid built glide cam and I love how much more compact it is compared to the overly priced GlideCam...not to mention it's incredibly bulky and impossible to pack on-the-go.<br /><br />Save yourself the extra $300 and get yourself a new lens.<br /><br />JMarcMedia(dot)com for an example of this glidecam in action!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Only disappointment is that we cannot set closed captioning.  We watched Season 1 on Netflix and had no problem seeing cc.  The series is fabulous.  Introduced it to my parents and brother last weekend and they watched all of season 1 in one evening!
B008BO61BE|5.0|This is an excellent album to revisit, sounds furious and fresh with the remastering. The live tracks are awesome and bring back great memories of<br />the metal gods in the 80's. Rob's voice is so iconic. The packaging is<br />great, and it is nice to see the US festival footage. If you were not around<br />in the 80's to see them play live this is a must have. This is every bit as<br />good as the anniversary edition of British Steel and is worthy of any Priest collection. We are missing an anniversary edition of Point of Entry though....
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie is dynamic from beginning to end.  I was never a huge batman movie fan, but never the less, I went to see them all.  By far, Christian Bale is the best ever, there is no comparison with the other actors who have played B.Man before.  This third (and hopefully not final) installment was excellent.  Every actor in the movie gives an outstanding performance, Michael Caine as Alfred really breaks my heart, love him!  Anne Hathaway is really great, and Tom Hardy after just seeing him in \\"Warrior\\" is quickly becoming one of my new favorites.  But it is Christian Bale who \\"rises\\" the Batman movies to a whole other level, he is spot on, all the time.  To be honest, with all that happened with the tragedy at the D. Knight Rises movie in Aurora Colorado, I was hesitant to venture out to the movie theater to see it.  I am now SO glad I did.  It did not disappoint.  And although I heard it was really lengthy, the time flew by; it flows smoothly and without any dull moments whatsoever. If you are a fan of Christian Bale, or Batman, this is one movie you shouldn't miss.  I cannot wait to add this dvd to my collection.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|The first season gets you hooked and the second season seals the deal..We purchased the first season and watched it up at the cabin while on Christmas vacation. What a great gift that was. So I purchased the second season to do the same thing this year. But my husband could not wait and watched it as soon as it arrived. We will watch it again during our christmas vacation and enjoy it together.
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love it so much better than trying to do website. the only reason that i didnt give it five stars is because it freezes sometimes and i have to get out of the app completely and get back in it. sometimes i have even had shut down my kindle by holding down the button...
B007V65R54|5.0|This review is a bit of a rebuttal to the well-written and thoughtful review by Ilya Grigoriev.<br /><br />If I understood the review correctly, it expresses a desire for more distilled and explicit insight from the stories and episodes that Mr. Silver describes in his book. However, one of Mr. Silver's main points is that the practice of prediction is fundamentally complex and resists simplification and reduction. Therefore, I believe a good account of prediction must also resist distillation. Indeed, Mr. Grigoriev's review seems to be seeking a 'hedgehog' explanation of the subject, while Mr. Silver's book provides a fox's treatment.<br /><br />I appreciate that Mr. Silver does not attempt to boil down his richly described accounts into summary nuggets. His accounts of prediction are intelligently and broadly chosen, and I found them to provide a refreshing opportunity for reflecting on big-picture issues, especially as a formal student of statistics. Mr. Silver uses the book format to treat the many facets of the prediction problem with the complexity and detail they deserve.<br /><br />One gripe I have is that Mr. Silver does not connect his description of Bayesian philosophy with its natural framework of computation and computer science. For that reason, I think this book fits nicely with David Deutsch's The Beginning of Infinity.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|As a history and family saga buff this hits the spot.  Follett not only gives well known history but facts and insight of political personalities and culture of that era. The intertwining of family members may be a little contrived at times but does move the story forward.  I always hate to come to the end and await anxiously for the next book.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought the book, read it and then felt as if I needed it out of my life as quickly as possible.<br /><br />There are no people like this married couple. There are no marriages like this marriage. I am not naive.....I professionally deal with people's problems every day.  The book does seem to start well but then takes an endless spiral all the way to it's depressing finish.  I felt embarassed that I had read this stuff.  Without getting into a deep psychological, analytical review let me just say, \\"how on earth are people giving this 5-4 star reviews?<br /><br />By all means keep reading but not this.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|Not at all what I was expecting after the first book.  Who in the book was not totally screwed up? Took too long to get to what happened to Gideon, however there are a lot of questions left unanswered.  I understand that there is to be a third book and I will read it but I won't be buying it when it first comes out. It just will not that important to read. I was thinking about reading some of Ms Day's other books but I will wait on that until after I read the third in this series.
B006OOHYIC|1.0|Great game. would give give stars, but recent update deleted all of my progress. Unacceptable. Put too much time into this game for the developers to also me in the face like this.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great follow-up to Fall of Giants.  Now starts the long wait for the third installment.  Ken Follett is a master story-teller.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third and final book in the Hunger Games series really delivers in the action, unexpected events, and emotionally rivetting choke holds of any book I'v read all year. Jumped on the bandwagon late, but the ride was breathtaking. If you didn't like the first two, don't bother, but if you made it that far, obviously your a fan. Love this series and highly recommend it. I'm purposelly not talking about the content of the story as not to ruin it for the reader. But boy oh boy are they in for an emotional ride. I allowed myself to become emotional attached to the characters, which doesn't happen often and takes a talented writer. The series is primarily for young adults, but really has a good amount of mature, thoughtful adult themes in it. There are some inconsistencies in the story, but the pacing helps you forgive them and they are not glaring.<br /><br />  Plainly put: Read this book asap.
B0038AL7M4|5.0|I've had the previous home video versions (VHS, two DVDs, and maybe one laserdisc) of this film, and this Blu Ray transfer by Arrow is the best ever.  The color is considerably stronger than previous releases, and the various audio options allow the buyer to hear the French or English soundtracks, including some rare voice-overs by Vincent Price that were done for the American release.  Whether you want to hear the Vincent Price \\"narration,\\" or TOBY DAMMIT in English (but the rest of the film in French), you can mix and match your preferences with this disc.  A great product for film buffs.  The disc played fine in my US Sony Playstation 3 deck.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game...the graphics are awesome. I can play this game all day.... Everyone should try this at least once.
0316228532|1.0|I bought this book for my 23yo daughter as a birthday present.  One day later she asked me to take it back because it was filthy.  She has no interest in reading the F word all the time.  They say it is J.K. Rowling's first book for adults, but what gave her the idea that truly mature adults want to hear the F-bomb all the time?
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Let me start by saying that I LOVED the first book in this series.  I loved both characters not despite but because of their broken spirit.  The h was strong and the H would do anything to make the h believe that she was the only person he could ever love.  I loved that their love for each other acted as a catalyst to healing rather than further pain.<br /><br />Book 2 is completely different.  I have no idea how the characters of the book could change so much.  It started with the way that everything was resolved with sex.  It simply got tedious.  I am by no means prudish in my reading but the constant fixing the relationship with sex just got really boaring.  Yes, I get it, they really enjoy their sex but when that was the primary thing that they shared, I began to loose interest.  It also lost a large part of the romance aspect for me.  What bothered me even more was that a H in book 1 that would do anything not to hurt the h would take actions that would crush the h.  I hate the it-is-for-your-own good argument so I had a really hard time with this plot twist after having to endure a lot of sex and very little story.  It didn't help how the h lost her spine in the end either.  That was probably my number one reason why I loved the h in the first book.  She wasn't your typical h.  In book 1, Eva called out the H when he mistreated her, she was jealous, possessive and just did not stand around when she was being treated as second best.  All of these things were absent from her character towards the end of the book.  She begs for the H even when he is clearly acting as though he has moved on.  In the end, despite all the pain the H has put her through; she is waiting for him to beg him once again if need be.  There is no anger for him not trusting her, no anger for his actions, everything is once again not dealt with at all.<br /><br />Yes, ultimately in his mind everything that was done was done in the name of protecting her but again, the reason I enjoyed book one was because of the h strong character and the H going out of his way to make the h trust in their love.  I found both things lacking in this story.  I think his protection could have been done in a manner that was not so painful for her.  OR if the h would have actually kept her spine and made the H work to earn her trust before she forgot all the pain he had caused her.  But, I hated how weak the h became, how she was suppose to blindly wait and trust everything despite all common sense, despite the fact he never gave her any reason to trust.  In the end, I felt both characters were unrecognizable to the ones from book 1.  There was little resolution to make me believe that their relationship was going to stop being caustic.<br /><br />For me this is one of those books where I am going to pretend that the story stopped at book 1.  I would highly recommend the first book, it was a great read but I can't say the same for this story.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Excellent Story Line, Animation. I Enjoyed It MUCH MORE Than I Did The 3rd Movie.<br />I'm Glad This DVD Released Not Long After The Movie, Helped With The Disappointment Of Watching The Movie.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is funny, exciting, and full of cliff-hangers! It is with know doubt the best Heros of Olympus book there is! I was forever gasping or giggling at funny or shocking parts. If you are about to start this book you are in for a surprise!

B007BVT5N4|5.0|I read this book because my granddaughter is a fan of Justin's and I wanted to give it to her as a gift.  I wanted to read it to make sure it was appropriate for her to read.  Needless to say I probably enjoyed the book as much as she did.  It gives you a lot more insight in to the hard work that goes in to a serious teen career.  I not only laughed a lot, but also cried a few times.  It was amazing, inspiring, and I feel there are much worse examples of stars that our young people look up too!  Bravo Justin!! I hope he keeps writing them as his career progresses.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an amazing and inspiring book to read! I hope that many people invest in a copy of this book.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I came into Season 2 of The Walking Dead with a good deal of skepticism. Season 1 had a very strong pilot and second episode, but was subsequently marred by stunted acting and uneven writing. I assumed that if they couldn't milk consistently compelling television out of a condensed, 6 episode season, there was little hope for another season with twice as many episodes. I was mistaken.<br /><br />Tension is the mood Season 2 kicks off with as zombies threaten to overwhelm the survivors on a lonely stretch of highway. What's genius here, and I'm not spoiling too much, is that this is one of the few times during Season 2 in which the \\"Walkers\\" are the central antagonists. Much of Season 2 is actually the tension of survivors learning to live in a world in which everything they know has been called into question or just plain cast aside.<br /><br />Everything about this season is better. The locations, the production values, and the zombies are all terrific. The writing is leaps and bounds better in Season 2. The acting is largely better, though some actors are just more gifted than others. In particular the actors who play Herschel, Shane, Maggie and Darryl really shine this season.<br /><br />At the end of the day, zombies are a terrifying, but largely manageable threat. It's learning to live in a world in which societies' structures and cultural norms have been overwhelmed that presents the biggest challenge. The writers and actors do an excellent job of exploring and conveying the challenges of living with other human beings in such a world. It's that tension of character that makes this season of The Walking Dead so compelling.
B008QE9VJI|1.0|As a fan of the original series this is soooo disappointing its criminal. I heard that both Depp and Burton were fans of the original. Really? Were they paying attention? Dark Shadows is more a Shakespearean Tragedy with all the themes of terrible jealousy, revenge and murder. They could have made something really dark and amazing and instead took the easy road to box office dollars by camping it up with humour (which really isn't even funny). I am afraid that this version has also effectively destroyed any hopes of a real remake of the franchise. Guess its back to reruns and a little 1990's revival on the side for me!
1897299214|5.0|The most damaging -- but fair -- criticism I've heard of this book came from reviewer E. Paul who said, &#34;The whole book is written in a 'Ha ha, look how strange they are!' way, with no real consideration of the moral and human crimes committed by the North Korean regime or the desperate plight of the North Korean people.&#34;<br /><br />I think that's right, but also badly missing the point. If you are looking for a definitive account of the moral atrocities occurring in N Korea, then a Guy Deslisle graphic novel is not the place to look. This is a book about what it's like to be a foreign visitor in N Korea. It is a tourist's candid impressions of the people and places he encounters in a strange and strangely controlled city. But that doesn't make it lightweight or dismissive. Quite the opposite.<br /><br />This book is even more poignant and informative than any &#34;definitive account of moral atrocities&#34; would be, precisely because of what it doesn't show you. It is plainly clear that Guy Deslisle is being selectively shown the best and most impressive parts of the country, and yet even those are fraught with signs of fragility and gloom, e.g., the giant pyramid on which work has been halted, leaving a &#34;visibly rotting carcass,&#34; or the International Friendship Exhibition dug into the side of a mountain to withstand nuclear attack, built with marble walls but cheap plastic light switches. We are left to imagine what the other 99% of the country must be like.<br /><br />Instead of giving us dry fact after dry fact, this book introduces us to real people in N Korea-- their fears, their joys, their perspectives. It helps us to understand N Korea by looking beyond the &#34;moral atrocities&#34; to the people who live there. And, in turn, it makes the atrocities more real.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I was very happy with this app, I was able to put my Word docs and pdf files on and use them easily UNTIL I downloaded the latest update.

B008X8QCTO|1.0|It took FOREVER to install, it kept installing components.  I have a kindle fire.<br /><br />It offers a strategy guide on the menu, but you have to 'like' them on facebook to use it.  Each time you want to use it, you have to repeat that process.  And the so called guide isn't that good anyway.<br /><br />I got to the first scene and did the first hidden object.  The writing in the object list is very tiny.  You can pinch the scene to expand it, but not the list.<br /><br />After the hidden object I was able to go to a couple of places then the game froze.  Not the kindle, but the game.<br /><br />Very disappointing.  I deleted it.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this.
1439102430|2.0|What happened to Kathy Reichs? Probably the same thing that happened to James Patterson, Jeffery Deaver, Tess Gerritsen, Lincoln & Childs, the Kellermans and so forth. These once tremendous authors get a bit of success and it's downhill. Reichs started downhill after her dreadful television series, Bones, with the actress who had one emotion - flat. This book was detailed to the point of being boring. Pages on what constitutes a CT scan? Most readers want the cliff notes version of an explanation, not technical blabber. She introduces a whole new subplot about Tempe's daughter gratuitously. Tempe gets in trouble again - same old formula. The plot was slow moving and boring. I skipped to the end at 8/10ths done. Perhaps Tempe and Reichs need to retire. Enough already. If you can't get back your mojo, then go gently into that good retirement.

B007N31Z06|2.0|The  blue ray picture is awfull i bought this thinking it was a fixed up remastered picture like the outstanding picture quality jaws was re-done in not by a long shot even i couldnt complain abought that one i so it must have been gooood. i thought the purpose behind all this 100 anniversery stuff was to show off thier movies in a new out standing picture quality all you get with this is  a rehash of old stuff the blue ray looks exactly like the dvd and all that is a rehash of a dvd that was out a couple of years ago  double secret probation. the  extras on this blue ray and dvd where on that one look for that one instead. the picture quality is much better  i think it was released in 2003 and a lot cheaper now.
0307155102|5.0|It's Richard Scarry - there's little more that needs to be said. This is a very large-size book and our 2 year old daughter loves it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book was as good as the first of the trilogy and since it was more current history, I could relate to it with better knowledge than the first book. The author continues to weave the story of 5 families into actual historical events that we've read about and make it seem possible for these characters to have actually been there. We know the historical outcome of the story but see it from several different points of view depending on where the characters were raised and their social and economic background. This is a well written and well researched book. Looking forward to the 3rd book!!<br />Also loved reading the Kindle edition as it is so much easier to carry a very light Kindle instead of a 960 page book while traveling!! I enjoy having the book downloaded from Amazon within seconds after  hitting the \\"purchase\\" button. I have now read more than 20 books on my Kindle and look forward to reading many more on this wonderful device!

160774273X|5.0|Before reading this book, I pretty much followed baking recipes word for word (yawn) and for the most part, created uninteresting bread.  I've followed recipes for 3 hour loaves to ultra-fussy 3 day preferment/multi-step steaming oven voyages.  Nothing in this catalog of recipes has done for me what Mr. Forkish has done.  Simply put, he has taught me techniques that get me in touch with dough itself.  The simple act of mixing by hand allows me to understand in an instant whether the dough is too wet or too dry, how far along it is in the bulk fermentation and when it is ready to bake.  That is the secret:  touch the dough, see how it responds, then adjust the time, temperature or the hydration to get it too the sweet spot.  That there are a limited number of recipes is immaterial.  In addition to teaching what will be for many, new techniques for baking, he also has an entire section on making your own recipes.  Maybe you prefer rye over pumpernickel.  Here is how you might change the recipe, and now you have your own bread.  I like semolina, and although he never mentions semolina, what I've learned from the general discussions in this book are on point.  Consider the property of the flour, follow basic proportion rules, and dig in.  The dough will tell you the rest of the story.  This is way better than a laundry list of recipes where authors simply swap one ingredient for another and call it new.  This is the kind of book that can last a lifetime, not because the recipes are inexhaustible, but because Mr. Forkish teaches technique and theory, all with infectious passion for his craft.
B007SGM084|4.0|I checked the trilogy out at my public library.  Normally I pass on these type of books but with all the hype I was curious.  My library had 7 copies and when I put mine on hold I was number 276 in line to check it out.  Took forever.  Theres an awful lot of sex and after a while you kinda fast forward that.  I was pleased that other then THE 4 letter word, the books aren't filled with filthy language.  Its a dominant / submissive kind of relationship to begin with that turns into real love with a lot of issues starting with an abused child.  The main male character, Christian, morphs from this really bad place to a much better place as the books progress.  There is a lot of very funny emailing between the two main characters that cracked me up with their subject lines and signatures.  Ana, the female quasi-submissive when she felt like it lol, has a kind of alter ego with very funny musings.  Example- harlot-red lipstick. \\"Don't get your panties in a wad.  Give me back mine\\".  Shes a funny character.  My favorite book is the third one.  There is mystery scattered through each book, more so in the last one.  At the end of book three, theres a chapter on Christian's childhood from what he remembers, the abuse, that helps you understand him a bit more.  Another chapter has his thoughts about Ana when he meets her, which again help explain him.  I wish there was more of his take on things in the books, since its written from Ana's perspective.
B000FC12ZA|2.0|My sister said she was reading this book and I should buy it.  I did read some reviews and they were negitive but I thought I would be open minded.  I read half the book and it was so boring I could not go on.  A waste of my money and wish I could get a refund now.

B008GVD6D8|1.0|I loved the first book, and had high expectations. This book got me really boring- ups and downs in the romance every other page for no real reason. Plus the physical admiration for each other got really annoying for a second book. I got it- he looks awsome.

B006XOBFB0|1.0|SONY!  What in the world are you doing?  You were my champion of better sound.  And now, this!  Set after set of mediocrity.  This is what you did 25 years ago!  If it were fruit, it would be rotting.<br /><br />It seems that Sony came out with SACD and it was a great improvement in sound - normal CD 26 bits per second, SACD 150 plus bits per second, so much more glorious sound.  BUT you had to be a SACD player, which I did, a nice Marantz model.  SACD player prices have since dropped and the technology has been put in many a player; my cheapo Blue Ray Panasonic plays them shockingly well.<br /><br />Then Sony developed DSD, which plays on the regular CD players and for a while it seemed that all their new releases would be in DSD.  DSD is a clear improvement.  Look for it.  This was going to be the wave of the future until the market caught up.  I don't know if the DSD can be copied but I know of no recorders for SACD therefore the the music industry would buy some time and a new age of golden sound would arrive in the SACD.  All hail Sony!  (Blue Line, which I have not heard but have only read about has not topped SACD.  As for DVD audio, it died.  It was sick to begin with.)<br /><br />DSD and SACD.  I anticipated.  I waited.  I grew jaded.  Sony is now putting out the oldest versions of their early CDs for, I guess, people who want smaller boxes since the disks are out there in used shops.  Sony has turned into the now bankrupt EMI, just repackage and release, repackage release and do it the cheapest way possible.  Sony US seems committed to providing low quality in a world of God-awful I don't know how you can stand it MP3!  But only in the US, and I guess, Europe.  Sony Japan seems committed to providing great sound.  Because the Japanese know and demand quality.  How anyone can listen to a symphony orchestra on MP3 is beyond me.  It is like peeing in a fine French feast.  I suppose you can eat it but oh God!<br /><br />Look, these are wonderful performances.  Classics.  Benchmarks.  However, the new DSD remasters have much better sound.  Buy that version.  I did even though I had this older set.  I just picked up a \\"like new\\" complete Murray  Perahia Mozart piano concertos DSD for about 5 bucks more than this set.  The disks sound wonderful.<br /><br />Sony, don't make us root for your demise.Classics.  Benchmarks.  However, the new DSD remasters have much better sound.  Buy that version.

B0098VXE50|5.0|The graphics in the movie are amazing, the acting, for the most part, is exemplary, and the action keeps you watching. The only thing that would have made it better is if, for the role of Snow White, they'd used an actress who could actually act instead of going with someone who's abilities are sub-par and was undoubtedly chosen solely on the hopes of attracting Twilight fans in order to increase ticket sales.

0375507256|5.0|I loved the book.  My one criticism would be that I thought he tried to wrap things up a little hastily at the very end.  The interweaving of the characters through time made for an intriguing puzzle and I can't wait for the movie to be released.
0525953728|5.0|These Navy Seals all are true heroes. In the forward Mark Owen writes that he had a Special Forces lawyer go over the complete manuscript to make sure no classified material was included. He also stated that his reason for writing the book was to encourage other young men and women to become Navy Seals. The book itself is very well written and will always be a part of our nation's history. Thank you Mr. Owen for your courage to write the book and your sacrifice for this country.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I feel betrayed.  The only good thing about this book is that I got it at the library and wasn't out one single cent.<br /><br />It seems Rowling is trying to prove how tough and in-the-know she is about filthy language and horrible people, rather than entertaining us with a good tale, as she did with Harry Potter.<br /><br />I only made it the first few chapters, as each page and each newly introduced character was a little less appealing than the one prior.<br /><br />I'm not sure where she's going with this story - as I said, I couldn't stay with it - but she's made sure I don't care.<br /><br />Badly done, J.K.  Badly done.

B005OGYH90|5.0|Hmmm where to start.  Under 4 star avg? Well, I understand some people were disappointed with the dvd. As of this writing, this has dragged down the overall rating.  In some ways, I blame amazon. The reviews for both mp3 download only (9 bucks) and the full dvd/cd set (19 bucks) are lumped under the same sku..?  Personally, I downloaded the mp3's.  But I gotta say, even if I had paid 19 bucks for the music ONLY, I would not have felt ripped off!<br /><br />Ok. Ask yourself this.  Did you love gnr?  Did you love appetite for destruction? Do you wish a modern band could even produce an album half as good as appetite?  Do you think alter bridge kicks major ash? Is Slash a f*n guitar god?<br /><br />If you answered yes to even 2 of the 5 questions, buy this album!  It gets 1 star for being slash. It gets another star for Slash playing 5 songs off appetite (with enough variation in lick/riffs to make you grin :). And it gets 4 stars for being a pretty damn good live album even if slash and kennedy were a bunch of nobody's! There you have it. 6 amazon stars. And wtf?? somebody complained about kennedy? You ever heard axel rose LIVE??<br /><br />I'm pissed I passed this up a 6 mths ago when I saw the low avg rating! Live and learn. Read the reviews and see why.  I did the same s*&t with contraband. Overlooked it because of the poor overall rating which turned out to be nothing more than some greedy corporate nimwit putting malware on the album cd to prevent (try to prevent) piracy! My new rule of thumb, read the reviews and buy any music slash (or myles kennedy) put out.<br /><br />I'll spare you a song by song review because you've heard the originals and leave you with this..  These two icons put a nice, live twist on some all time classic album hits. nuff said.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I love these boys! They are so down-to-earth and relatable. Every time I see them/read about them I just really want to hang out with them and be their friend. ;)
0375703764|1.0|All the one star folk have pretty much said it all, if you want complete dissection of the book, so I'll keep this short.<br /><br />Freakin' boring.<br /><br />In all fairness, I just got through reading The Name of the Wind and carried that thing with me EVERYWHERE even if I only had time to read two words. So... moving on to this was beyond problematic.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this. And still want to. And there are some things I do like. A friend described it and was incredibly enthusiastic about it and I haven't read anything that was good and scary recently soooo...<br /><br />Yeah... a growl in the darkness. Ooooh, I'm scared. A growl in the dark??? Give me a break!<br /><br />But, I'll slog through it (although I'm reading ahead all the time just letting it flop open and reading what's in front of me in hopes of finding something to compel me to read further). There are a few things I like, such as the staircase, that's cool. And I like the overall construction of the book  and I was excited about the \\"weird\\" way it's put together with footnotes and backward writing and all that. What fun, I'd thought! Like a puzzle, I love puzzles.<br /><br />But then I remembered there was a series of mystery books put out years ago that looked like a detectives case file and had photos and fake telegrams and fake death certificates etc. and soon all the \\"weirdness\\" has become same ol' same ol'.<br /><br />But, like I said, I'll slog through it and if it doesn't get better soon, what the heck I bought it used and cheap. It's just that I'm so booooooorrrrred.<br /><br />okay, update, I finished the book. I am ambivalent. There are a few parts I liked, as in, the exploration of the house was kind of fun and it could have been wonderfully terrifying... could have been. But, for me, wasn't at all.<br /><br />I won't NOT recommend it to people, it might be of interest to them if they're looking for something different, otherwise, the best thing I can say is.... meh.
B0000683DH|5.0|I have to admit I am sci-fi geek. I love Star Wars and Star Trek equally. So I had to have this film in my DVD collection. I have say I feel The Wrath of Khan is the best to date out of the Star Trek films. The performances are great and if you are a hardcore Trekkie the ending scene will leave you in tears. If you want a Star Trek film I highly recommend you purchase this one.

B0091574VI|5.0|Amazing video with exceptional production. Definitely an entertaining watch and well worth the few dollars to view. Great for children to watch too as it shows the connection and human-like behavior of chimps.
B008V0OLOW|2.0|The Deluxe edition of this CD includes 4 tracks not found on the regular CD release.  On those four tracks, Diana Krall sings accompanied by only her own excellent piano playing.  Those four tracks are the best on the recording, in my opinion.  There's simply too much production in the rest of the recording.  It muddies the sound and strangles the emotional content of each song.  As someone pointed out, once you get past the overall album's concept, there's not much here.<br /><br />While I'm sure musical artists like to challenge themselves and try other genres, very few of them ever succeed.  This is an example of an artist taking a risk and failing.  Ms Krall's strength is in solid core jazz, vocal and instrumental.  She should build on this in the future.  Perhaps a solo recording of just her voice and the piano would be in order.<br /><br />I've enjoyed most of Ms Krall's music since her first recording.  This is not one I will listen to much, if at all, in the future--a fate it shares with \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\".  Very disappointing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well worth the read... Love the Book!!! Once I picked it didnt want to put it down till I was Finished.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I absolutely love wasting my time with this app. It's SO much fun! My mom (early 40s) simply cannot put it  down. It seems simple at first, but you soon realize that it is indeed a game that will make you bring out your strategic skills.
B000669GAI|5.0|In the early 90's, when Pearl Jam came out, I didn't know whether to love them or hate them. I loved the music, but I did not like the changes taking place in the New Wave/Punk music scene. At that point the music was replaced by \\"alternative.\\" the grunge scene totally turned me off, even though I was a fan of Nirvana and pearl Jam who were unfairly dubbed grunge. However, as much as I did not like their success at the time, I couldn't help but love their music. It is evident how much of themselves they put into their music. The further in their career  that they got, the more I seemed to like and respect them; they are very unconventional in every way.<br /><br />Until recently, that respect did not translate into a supporting fan. I did not listen to any of their albums in the past 20 years. I have recently begun buying up the material and even though I purchased some of the album that this music is on, I wanted to give this a listen anyway and am very impressed. This is a great collection of their music and a perfect starting point for new, or old, fans.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|This is a great song....very good tune...easy to understand words, although Carly Rae Jepsen is rather young...but at my age, everybody is young!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a great movie. There was a great balance between acting, action, and storyline that will make this enjoyable for older comic book fans, and new moviegoers. I was happy with Banner's character, even though it wasn't Norton, Ruffallo did a great job; oh, and Hulk looked his best this time around. Captain America was the same guy from the comic book, which I appreciated that they didn't change him. The tension was there, and so was the camaraderie from the comics. Now I'm just waiting to see what's next!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I  loved  this  book.  It actually  had a plot  and not  just  sex. I couldn't put it  down until all  three  books were read.
0316228532|5.0|J.K. Rowling writes death so accurately; only those who have directly experienced an unexpected loss will immediately recognize and absorb the exact rightness of it.<br /><br />She writes all of it: the eager gossip of those titillated but untouched offering their conversation as currency, versus the stunned involuntary silence of survivors whose lives instantaneously change to someone else's dream or film scene unintentionally wandered into, which we cannot recognize, nor do we know our lines or even where to put our next footstep. The swirl of characters at the beginning is appropriately, realistically confusing. Their names and associations make the reader dizzy like a person who has lost, in an instant, the ground on which a most-beloved partner in life stood; she cannot identify any voices surrounding her.<br /><br />Even the title, The Casual Vacancy, fits the insult, the trivialization brought by death mocking lives lost so quickly and easily--so casually--yet so stunningly, permanently. Many readers will not know what deep truth Rowling offers us. But those of us who do--appreciate the telling. It makes us a little less insane.<br /><br />Adult readers of the Harry Potter series will appreciate the detail, depth, and ultimate connectedness-of-everything that Rowling writes. She is an amazing writer. For the uninitiated, if you love the depth of Toni Morrison's writing, you will find Rowling eminently readable.
0812993292|5.0|In The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce, Harold Fry is a retired salesman who sets off on an unplanned cross country trek wearing yachting shoes and a simple jacket.  When Queenie Hennessey, a friend Harold worked with 20 years ago, writes him from a hospice that she is dying of cancer, he immediately writes an awkward reply but, after a chance encounter on the way to post the letter, he decides he must deliver his message in person. Harold believes that his sacrificial journey will somehow make Queenie live longer.  Thus begins his unlikely pilgrimage that lasts 87 days and covers 627 miles.<br /><br />As Harold steps out in faith and sets off on his journey, his real motives are slowly revealed. The quest gives Harold ample time to take the opportunity to reflect on his life. Harold leaves his wife, Maureen, without a word of explanation until after he starts his journey.<br /><br />Maureen and Harold have long standing issues they need to ponder and analyze. Both need to delve into some hard truths about their lives and marriage. While they both perceive the failing state of their marriage differently, unknown to each other, they actually come to many of the same realizations even while they are unable to talk about their feelings. They need to confront the truth about their son. Harold needs to face some hard facts from his childhood.<br /><br />The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry starts off on a rather optimistic, redemptive note.  It certainly doesn't initially feel like it is going to address any serious issues or face anything too complex. But, while Harold is walking to save Queenie's life, he is really examining his own life. And, while Maureen initially worries over his mental state, she eventually must also deal with herself.<br /><br />Chapters alternate between Harold and Maureen and surprised me with the seriousness of the topics confronted in Harold and Maureen's lives. What initially seems to be a whimsical decision is fueled by guilt, regret, and the need for atonement.  The novel seriously covered what it is to be loved as a child and an adult. It scrutinizes what love, marriage, parenthood and friendship can be, as well as regret, forgiveness, denial, and grief.<br /><br />I was really cheering for Harold on his pilgrimage and found myself telling him to go get a sensible pair of boots for hiking or a backpack or... but that is part of charm of this novel. Charm that pulls you in and then, as Harold is walking through real physical pain, he also starts to reveal some other pain in his life. By the time this novel was over I was totally enthralled and definitely a fan. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry was recently long-listed for the Man Booker Prize.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended - one of the best<br /><br />Disclosure: I received an advanced reading copy of this book for review purposes.uilt, regret, and the need for atonement.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|Although I liked Games of Thrones a little bit more than this one it still held on to the magical aspect that drew me into the first.  I love most of the characters storylines however I did find myself wanting to skip over some of them (Theon), I suppressed this urge and read on.<br /><br />I like that in this one we get to see a change in the characters and learn a different viewpoint about them (especially Jaime).  Sansa is still irritating me and I don't know why but Bran just gets on my nerves, I know he is a kid but man he just annoys me.  Arya and Tyrion are still my favorites and their story just keeps getting better and better!<br /><br />There is always the problem of keeping the characters straight but I didn't have as much trouble with that as I did in the first book.  It didn't detract too much from the series and I thought all of the different perspectives made the book so enjoyable.

034580404X|5.0|I have yet to finish the third book of the set but I must say I am pleased so far. I was not certain I would enjoy it. This is not simply a story about kinky sex. I am anxious to see what will happen with the last book.
0440217563|4.0|This is the third book in the Outlander Series.  The main character Jamie suffers from seasickness ad nausea!  As the reader I got \\"sick\\" reading about Jamie's upchucking for more than 100 pages.  I felt that I had \\"sea legs\\" and being \\"marooned\\" on the deck of a small boat for several 100 pages.  When the Jamie and Claire (the other main character) at last find their \\"land legs,\\" the storyline begins to be interesting.  I believe the little Chinaman \\"Mr. Willougby's\\" acupuncture treatment for Jamie's seasickness saves this third book.  Afterall, the title of this third book is \\"Voyager.\\"<br /><br />The author is talented with interesting word usage and she is able to weave and reconnect characters from the first and second books in her Outlander series. Several times the reader may have to thumb through the many pages to reacquaint with the minor characters and be able to follow the storyline she adroitly weaves in her rich tapestry of Jamie and Claire.  In summation, the reader wants to finish the third thick book in anticipation of the trials and tribulations and hopefully joyful outcomes in their future endeavors in the fourth book.

B00422LESO|1.0|Like most ardent Jane Austen fans I feel that I have a personal relationship with her as her writing has comforted me through many trials and tribulations in my life.  Therefore I am fiercely protective of that relationship and as a result never have read anything from the genre of Austen offshoots.  My fear being that someone will exploit her nuanced storytelling and make a mockery of what has impacted millions of readers throughout the centuries.  Austenland was my first choice, and one I greatly regret.  It is a perfect example of my worst fears come to light.  Even without using Austen as a backdrop, the writing, story, plot and characters are so one-dimensional that it's insulting to the reader.  I could go on and on in my breakdown of all that is wrong but I won't a customer's time.  Just don't waste your time with this dribble, there are so many other fun, easy and lighthearted literature that entertains without insulting (anything by Sophie Kinsella or re-read Bridget Jones Diary).  To be quite honest, I don't blame the writer.  I'm sure she did the best she could.  But the editor and publisher should be ashamed.

It's as addicting as \\"Sign No More\\", yet even more beautiful as you realize that it is a continuation of Mumford and Son's special brand of music.  My day is not complete without a go through of this album with its lovely lyrics, spiritual offerings, emotional crescendos and it continues to get under my skin as did their first album.  I can't stop listening and I'm happy to have a new crop of this joyful, thought provoking music.  Hurray...you will not be disappointed.  Thank you Mumford and Sons!

Then, as I studied the steps shown in this guide I began to gain a clearer picture of the process from beginning to end. This guide is an easy read. It will enable anyone who is new to this process to have the confidence to get started by following each step to the end. A terrific beginner's guide to the process of getting published on Kindle.
B000L2S8SI|4.0|My purchase of the planet waves vinyl was good yet not what I had expected. The record itself was in great condition and appeared to not have been used. However, the outer case and the cover were both cut in the lower right hand corner. I would have liked to have known this before purchasing it since it was a gift and looked like it had been sliced with a craft knife. The overall appearance of the vinyl in its original case was not what the best but the purchase was still worth it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read a lot of books in my youth and adult life. This books is at the top. I've seen all these reviews that pick the book apart, but come on here, it's entertainment. And entertaining it is. I found it hard to put down just from reading the sample that I immediately purchased it. Just finished it and purchased the rest of the triology on my Kindle. And that's saying a lot since I'm picky about what I spend my money on.<br /><br />The books skips over frivolous details and gives just enough to visualize and get to the plot. I like that. I found this book powerful and I'm fantasizing about it all day long. I've stayed up late all week reading this book. It's like anticipation for a date. I can see why I heard so much about it over the radio in the last few months.<br /><br />Anastasia is a lucky girl. Let's face it, all men are f***ed up. You gotta figure what you can deal with. At least he's hot, rich and wants to adore her. I'll take that any day.<br /><br />I will continue reading the trilogy and boasting about this book. I know my man is happy once I put it down. A must read for any woman wanting something \\"more\\".
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I've been wanting this for some time, but if I remember correctly, the initial price tag was ludicrously high. Got it at around $30, which compared to getting them all new separately, ain't half bad. I'm not really big on Blu-Ray, and since these movies are probably too old for that to matter, it's a great deal. Comes with tons of DVDs, each movie having its own \\"supplemental\\", plus an extra one to wrap things up, giving you just as much bonus material, if not more, than movie material. I haven't gotten around to watching any of the supplementals yet, but it's a nice extra if I get the time to watch them. The only real downer is if you want to watch either Alien or Alien: Resurrection, not because they're bad, but because of the packaging. It's not a big complaint, and it all does look nice, but it folds out and with all the DVDs included, sprawls to about 5 feet in length! So pretty much my only complaint is, \\"You have to do a lot of folding\\". And if you ask me, that's not bad at all. If you're an Alien fan and don't have all the movies already, buy this.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book was good but not as good as book one or three (I am still reading Three). I did not like it as much because it had a lot of sex and not enough of a story.  You will read it if you have it because you want to know what happens next...Enjoy
B008I3QZKU|5.0|A band is all about growing but maintaining that familiar sound. Tell me one cd that was just released that sounds ANYTHING like what the killers are doing right now? Bad lyrics? Look them up! they are quite good and lest you not forget this band isn't about lyrics. The picture on the cell phone line? cheesy? Guaranteed concert goers will be loving it with their phones in the air! He sings it with so much passion it can't sound cheesy to fans. I will say that this wasn't an instant classic first listen, I had to appreciate where this album wanted to go. And that was straight to the top! This is by far there most inspired, passionate and energetic album to date.<br /><br />Hot fuss is hot fuss for a reaon. A yougn band's debut album, sam's town is the sophomore effort that rocked hard back into the sprignsteen age. Day and age was a foray into the mystic, disco, bongo and all together different. Yet they were all still incredible albums including saw dust. His vocals and lyrics were great for those albums at that time, but... Here, he absolutely lets loose and brings the house down. This is Hot fuss, sam's town, saw dust, and day & age all rolled into one. There is synth, there are love lost lyrics, there are guitars and the fantastic Ronnie V! The killers are inspired by bands like u2, the boss, pet shop boys, the smiths and many others. That has been evident from day one. These guys are not 20 anymore and you aren't going to get a hot fuss or sams town 2.0. You are getting this. The album itself is battle born. Its about recognizing who you are and what your made of, telling the stories of how you got that way and in the end letting the world have it! Best tracks: all of em!<br /><br />Sorry you aren't getting a mr. brightside sequel. If they put out ANYTHING like there past albums it would have been: \\"this sounds just like there last album and all the songs sound the same.\\" Appreciate good music when you get it. Oh, and go see them live. You will understand why they will go down as one of the biggest bands of all time!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I was gifted this book by Rebecca Hamilton, result of a twitter competition. The Forever Girl had been on my list to-read anyway, and it was just a bonus to get it directly from the writer herself. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!!!!<br /><br />I absolutely love new takes on the paranormal. This is one I've never encountered before, so it was fresh, and very interesting. Vampires, shape-shifters and witches, instead of being run of the mill para-norms, they're actually Elementals and are in addition to beings of other elements. This was a very awesome concept and had me impressed with its depth, it's really one of a kind.<br /><br />As for the story itself, I kept finding excuses TO read it, sneaking my phone out to read on mostly, despite being busy at work or at family functions. The tale is definitely engrossing, starting out with the need to find out what causes Sophia to hear the buzzing/voices in her head, and once the answer was revealed, I was excited. Then my reaction turned to the \\"OMG JUST BE TOGETHER!\\" urging at the characters, I felt like a cheerleader. \\"You can do it! Yaaaay!\\" I was always on Sophia's side, and didn't get angry with her for her actions (Some characters you can love to hate, but thankfully Sophia is one you love to love). Sometimes I thought she was a little too accepting of some of the initial situations, but it went with her personality. I typically found myself disliking her friend Ivory, and despite revelations about Ivory, I still couldn't like her very much. I guess I should say that I just couldn't forgive that character for her actions.<br /><br />The writing itself was very well done, and I don't recall being perturbed by any errors in the editing. As a writer, I focus a lot on how time passes, it's one of the things I struggle with, so I find myself always been a little more critical in that area. I think that the development (or portrayal of development) of the relationship between Sophia and Charles was a little out of tune with the passage of time. I found it to be just a tad imbalanced, but not unrealistic. Reactions and twists were very believable, relate-able, and I appreciated them.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story so much, I will be reading it again before the much-anticipated sequel comes out, which I will definitely be purchasing!!! In the meantime, I will be reading 'Her Sweetest Downfall' (Actually I looked forward to getting off work all day just so I could read it it, in t- 5mins.)
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out on video.  I am a huge classic and silent movie fan, and \\"The Artist\\" was no disappointment.  It was so well done, if I hadn't known better, I would have thought it was a movie from the 1920s.  Jean du Jardin was fantastic--he needed no words to convey the story and his emotions.  AND he is GORGEOUS!!!  Uggie the Dog was a joy and an incredible talent too!  A delightful story that old movie buffs and the whole family will enjoy.
B009KUANWG|5.0|This song is fantastic! I like how Adele didn't fill the song with runs and overpowering highs. This is a song you can put on repeat and jive with all day. Best Bond song yet!
0316096199|5.0|This book was pretty good. It was insightful and mind-blowing. As a female, rape is something I fear but after reading this book it has caused me to be on full alert. It has also helped me to understand some of the pains that a rape victim can go through. Some people choose to become better people some do not, and the author of this memoir showed how she overcame this trauma and became a stronger individual.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie. Had me glued to the screen from the get go. Loved the look and the effects were pretty awesome. I especially loved the female lead actor on this. She looked like she could kick some serious butt as opposed to other movies where the female lead is usually puny, weak and overly girly. If you enjoyed movies like Star Wars or Indiana jones then your really going to enjoy this. Loved the film and really hope there will be a sequel. I really want to find out what happens next.
1466401885|2.0|I bought this book to read on a recent flight after reading the back cover description but not reading online reviews or knowing anything else about the author. I'm clearly not the intended audience for this book. I don't mind \\"chick-lit\\" as it's termed--I enjoy both Jennifer Wiener and Jodi Picoult, who would be considered chick-lit authors. But this book is a thinly veiled romance novel, reminiscent of Twilight or 50 Shades of Grey, neither of which did I like. This book is clearly aimed at women who feel like they are missing something in their life or who have been waiting for Prince Charming to come along and sweep them off their ordinary feet and tell them the whole world has been blind to how special they really are.<br /><br />While the underlying plot has potential--there's certainly tension, there's mystery about Abby's history and you even see the characters struggle with both external and internal issues--there are so many unbelievable and unrealistic things that happen, you seriously have to suspend your disbelief to read this book. And the writing itself never digs into the details. There's tons of unnecessary dialogue, complete with terrible dialogue tags (he gushed, she cried, etc.), where instead there could be interesting passages of expository detail about the characters themselves, their surroundings, and so on, that would help the reader really see the things that happen.<br /><br />It's clear the writer knows next to nothing about several of the things she writes about in the book, but includes them anyway because they add to the whole \\"fantasy.\\" First, it takes years (I mean 3-10 years) to cover your arms, chest and back with the tattoos that Travis has. Even quarter sleeves, let alone full sleeves, are completed over a number of years for multiple reasons--including because any tattoo artist worth his salt would spend time on a piece of art that big and intricate. You need to wait a certain amount of time in between large tattoos because of the risk of infection, and many tattoos take multiple visits to fill in if you want them to last or look good in a few years. So basically, Travis would've had to start his tattoos when he was 15 or even younger. I'm sure there are people who either use a fake ID or get their parents to sign for them, but I just have a hard time believing a 19-year-old has tattoos as extensive as his.<br /><br />Second, she clearly hasn't played much poker. (plot spoiler here) Abby gets winning hand after winning hand to win the games she plays. But ask any great poker player and they'll tell you, you don't play the hand, you play the player. Most hands are won on bluffs or intimidating the other player into folding when you're afraid the other person will pick up their kicker on the turn or the river. Abby certainly could use her age and the fact that she's a pretty girl to her advantage (especially if she'd been playing poker since she was just a kid), but the way the writer portrays it, that's not what she does. She wins by having the better hand. Every time. That's just not real poker.<br /><br />Third, she places back alley clubs and mobsters offices directly on the Las Vegas strip. Nope. No way. The only thing on the strip is hotels, casinos and restaurants. I'd buy it if she said they stayed in old Vegas, off Fremont Street, which can be a pretty bad area. But she specifically says that Abby and Travis walk out of the office and down the strip. Old Vegas and the strip are far enough apart that it's a $20 taxi ride to get from one to the other. You don't walk from old vegas to the strip. You don't even walk from one end of the strip to the other.<br /><br />But the absolute worst thing about this book is that it romanticizes a relationship that in the real world (1) just wouldn't happen and (2) is abusive and controlling. The author is just like one of the many girls that hang all over Travis. She actually believes a guy like Travis can suddenly go from sleeping with a different girl every single night to professing his undying love for one girl and never wavering from it.  Even better, more mature men have fallen short of being able to remain faithful. The roommate, Kara, had it completely right when she asks Abby if she knows what a codependent relationship is. Because that's exactly what Travis and Abby have. And the author could've still written the relationship that way--the family history that both characters have make it totally believable that Travis would believe he couldn't live without Abby and she would accept the mess of a relationship they have as love. Real love is certainly messy, but it doesn't happen before you even know anything about the person (that's called lust), and it doesn't make you feel as if you'll die if that person isn't in your life. Granted, a lot of teenagers probably feel that way the first time they think they're in love. but, without giving the ending away, a better writer would've ended this book very differently.
B000TGJ8AS|4.0|i did not watch NCIS in the beginning so i'm trying to catch-up. From that standpoint i loved it.  I did not enjoy how it seems to be \\"pieced\\" together.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I think that the author could do something better with the idea. The book starts really good but then the reader expects for action and hard scenes and instead she resolves all the issues really easy. I won't read the other two books.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This really helps a lot when I get on it will tell me the amount of battery I have. When I'm in the car waiting to get to the place I can check my charge. Thanks For The App :D
B0098WWEH8|5.0|This album passed my spin test: I listened to it without out skipping a single track, and by the time the final seconds on the last song ticked away I wanted to hear it all over again. This cd didn't leave my car cd player for two weeks. The last album to pass my spin test was Bon Iver's self titled record, and I think this is even better.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great show! I wanted to watch one episode after the next. I remember catching bits and piece from the first season when it was on television but never had the time to actually watch it. When I realized I could buy the first season through Amazon I didn't hesitate. I would like to own a physical disc for the show but having it stored in an online library is super convenient. Season two, here I come!
B0042UEU8M|5.0|My roommate and I had an itch to re-watch this sweet movie about brotherhood, mourning, and moving on, and realized Amazon instant video would be a super convenient way to \\"rent\\" the movie. I highly recommend Charlie St. Cloud - though you might want some tissues - it is a bit of a tear-jerker!
B008OOYALE|3.0|I am on Kindle Fire HD and haven't been able to log on Dragon Story for a week now!  I love this game and I am level 96 and I don't want to start over please!  Anyone else with this issue?
B00005JNS0|5.0|Great movie, my son recieved it for his second birthday and loves it.  Even my four year old daughter will watch it and if you have kids, you know the value of a movie they can both agree on.
B007LB2B3K|5.0|This album is awesome!!!  The music is amazing and the lyrics are powerful and send a message.  This album hits me at my core. I loved the music before I looked at the lyrics. Now that I have... hold on!  I can't wait for the next one!!!
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This movie is excellent. It was beautifully shot and the character's fears and emotions were wonderfully conveyed throughout. But the most fascinating character is played by Liam Neeson, who, as usual, did a fantastic job. As the film progresses, more and more is revealed about his character and his motivations. And the hauntingly simple score elevates the film to another level. I enjoyed it so much I plan on reading the short story it's based on.
B009329Y30|4.0|The Lucky One was a great movie.  Good character development and good drama. Zac Effron played a quiet, mild mannered, army guy well.  Definitely a must see chic flic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is great but you should wait till the trial comes out. so u can try this out ur self
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finished the book at the 72% location. Could not take it any more. Is it about humans? Probably, no aliens have been reliably identified as yet.<br /><br />Is it about bonobos? Not really, the protagonists are monogamous, bonobos (as far as I know) are definitely not. To be more precise, going through book 2 and three one probably learns something about the concept of 'serially monogamous', also unknown to bonobos.<br /><br />Is it the future of our species? Very likely. Does it fill me with joy? No.<br /><br />Well, heterosexual BDMS (or the gay variety) is not my cup of tea, obviously. Just an interesting detail: while Wikipedia treats BDSM very seriously, almost scholarly, it applies only to the GENERIC BDSM, definitely not to its gay variety. Typing gay BDSM in Bing results in what one would expect: hundreds upon hundreds of explicit porn sites, most of them, of course, with wonderful stuff for sale.<br /><br />Shall I say that America is on its way to hell (if it exists) with this book 30 weeks on a bestseller list? No, this would not be politically correct at all.<br /><br />Well, maybe not. During the life of Marquise de Sade (the father of sadism, just to be complete) there were no bestseller lists, e-books and similar stuff. I can imagine that like under the Soviets, an underground samizdat (one can call it sadizdat) existed people copying by hand every word the Great Marquise had written.<br /><br />There has been some progress. For a mere $9.99 one can have this Grey Book, Volume 1, all 500 pages plus of it, instantly on several devices.<br /><br />I am so glad to about drop dead - I am just unable to pretend that this is a serious stuff. But, deep down I know that it is very serious for some people, indeed.<br /><br />Just one 'review' out of some 20,000. Isn't a record for Amazon?<br /><br />The only good thing about this is that it, apparently, contributes bit to Amazon's rather meager profits and thus keeps Amazon afloat - a wonderful store sellingalmost anything imaginable.<br /><br />I never imagined, silly me, that THIS kind of stuff will be ever taken seriously. I was so wrong!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was a bookclub choice and recomended by a person that is well read, so knew it would be interesting.  Miss Strayed makes the trail real and the details about her hike more than real.  Well written and very interesting.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm seriously obsessed with this app! So helpful for everyday living; so many genius ideas! I've become a guru of many things, including saving money, because of the ideas people share on here.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Brings back so many memories of the days gone by. I was the one of my group with the divorced parents so I really relate to this, I even have a younger sister. Grandma was a big part of those years too. Only thing that was different is that my Dad was around and Mom never had boyfriends. Great period story of the early 1970's and the soundtrack is top of the line.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love to use this to meditate. for me and my kids.there is a great variety of sounds to choose from and combine.
B008966SLM|5.0|Just bought it and can't stop listening to it. The guitar, the soulful voice, the support band, the writing, the production, everything is perfect.<br /><br />Almost all songs have that catchy thing making me pushing the replay button again and again<br /><br />Thank you again Mr Cray, can't wait to see you in Paris in February !
B004UID2LC|3.0|I cant down load on it. something is wrong with it. ive re downloaded it but that wont work. please fix it. thank you.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|Jonas Jonasson's book (translated by Rod Bradbury) is a farcical tale featuring Allan Karlsson, a spry dynamite expert who escapes from an old folks' home shortly before his 100th birthday party in 2005. Without a plan, Allan heads to the bus station and inadvertently detonates a series of incredible, humorous events. Coincidences abound, but rather than resolving the conflict, they thrust the characters deeper into the fray.<br /><br />The chapters alternate between the events following Allan's 2005 escape and his life story spanning 1905-2005.  We watch Allan evade the authorities and a criminal gang searching for him, and we learn of the many times Allan survived death in the past (and his secret to longevity).  Throughout his extraordinary life, Allan gets entangled in significant historical events and ends up meeting some of the most powerful world leaders of the 20th Century.  History buffs who are able to suspend their disbelief will enjoy the guest appearances of these important political figures.<br /><br />Jonasson's novel is best for people looking for escapist literature who enjoyed Winston Groom's Forrest Gump and Rachel Joyce's The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry.  The lack of transitions between paragraphs in some of the chapters (switching between characters) made the book feel clunky at times, but overall, this novel was a pleasant read due to its fascinating plot and its dark, dry humor that kept me amused and half-smiling throughout the novel's 400 pages.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its a great app but sometimes it has a hard time launching on the first try. It still does what its supposed to :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i have this on my android Razr. downloaded it to my Kindle fire for my son. now i cant stop playing on thre fire.
1579129129|5.0|Just received this yesterday.  Ordered it sight unseen and hoped for the best.  This book is gorgeous!  The collection is amazing, and the photography is beautifully done and well lit. The skulls are on a black background, which seems to intensify the details.  I was afraid there wouldn't be many photographs, but the book is jam packed with them.  The collection is diverse and the skulls are in great condition.  Two people who couldn't care less about skulls or bones were fascinated.  I can't wait for the weekend to get here so I can sit down and spend some serious time with it. A very exciting find!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was a definite page turner! I loved the characters and the intro to domination like I never guessed I would! My favorite part in the book was when he dropped to his knees! awesome visual and quite heart wrenching! Hey but I am very emotional! Christian is the most loveable screwed up man I have ever read about! This rest of the characters?....well they just made Christian come alive! Would definitely recommend!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|book was more fullfilling as story line held atention. caused me to buy the next book to follow story. have finished book two and starting book three. good read
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Great series of a biker club and life issues that go along with the biker images. Very well done. Great characters, awesum story line, believable too! I have enjoyed this series very much, season 5 is starting off kicking butt!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|as i said in the title above this product is absolutely stupendous. i would reccomend this to anyone in to puzzles.
B000W022XG|4.0|trippy beats, haunting choruses, this album is the epitome of portishead. Found biscuit,glory box and wandering star to be the best tracks by far, the others range from decent to filler.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love the different versions available and the variety of devotionals. great app! :) i wish the highlighting was available off line though.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Everyone is talking about Grey and his shades. If you want to join in on the gossip then yes, read it.<br />If you couldnt care less about the gossip then save your money and read some of the other really juicy good stuff available at a much more reasonable price!<br />It will all be over in a few months anyway when the gossip dies down.<br /><br />Its a fast read, a simple no brainer. Its juicy and catching and triggers all the right things. But intelligent? No. Leaves a lasting impression? No.<br />Its just brain candy for the MILF.
B0087HT36U|5.0|this game is unreal how good and adictive it is  some of the levels are nearly impossible..so have some bombs on hand just in case!
0451529065|4.0|I was shocked but amazed to read an entire chapter on Darwin's description of all the flaws in his theory and how if they came to pass, his theory would completely break down. How has the world overlooked the FACT that all the flaws he lists have come to be true? As a scientist, I am embarrassed for the blindness of accepting this clearly flawed theory! - READ IT FOR YOURSELF!!!! CHAPTER 6 is the only correct part of the theory! MUST READ!!!!
1439102813|4.0|Alice is a very respected Harvard research professor in psychology linguistics. She has a family that she loves very much, with their own inside quarrels of course. She starts forgetting things. Small things at first, and then she gets lost in her own neighborhood. She reluctantly ends up at the neurologist's office and is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's at only 50 years old. She is devastated. How can she continue her rigorous work at Harvard if she can't even remember what class she's supposed to be teaching? What if she can't remember who her husband is? What if she's passed this disease onto her children? What if she gets so bad off that people act like she doesn't have a voice in what she needs or wants? These are issues Alice knows she will have to deal with, she just doesn't know how soon it will be. So glad that I read this book. If you know anyone that has Alzheimer's, it would be a great idea to read this book to have a sense of what they have to go through.
B008S0IJAM|4.0|Aimee Mann creates another solid album. The eponymous song \\"Charmer\\" looks into what happens when a person's public persona takes over. In fact, many of these songs deal with the subjects of putting your \\"best face\\" on, and hiding or changing who you really are--interesting subject material!<br /><br />The songs are catchy, the lyrics witty as always. I'm not sure if I'll be listening to this album in a few years, but right now it's on repeat. Good but not great. 4 stars.
0525953728|4.0|Book was everything i hoped for. very clear businesslike account of professionals quietly doing their job of protecting the USA from villains. Hope for a sequel on Libya.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids love it. I even got my nephew addicted to playing. My 3yr old even loves it especially hatching the eggs.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|I MOST APPRECIATE THE HIGH QUALITY OF SOUND IN THIS REMASTERING OF THESE NUMBER ONE BEATLES HITS.  MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT IT DID NOT CONTAIN LENNON'S IMAGINE.<br /><br />DR B
B005JE7WKI|5.0|This movie is by far the funniest 'misunderstanding' movie I've ever seen. It's silly and fun, has a great plot, and the characters are perfect. Tyler Labine and Jesse Moss did some really great work acting out two dynamic roles. The gentleness of one character versus the creepy evil of the other was the ideal contrast. This movie makes me laugh every time I see it. The lines are awesome. The setting and circumstances made for some really unusual action. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. You must watch it.<br />BTW, I am a redneck with hillbilly family. I love them and I love this movie because it shows how people misread and stereotype us as crazy and mean. The main characters are so likeable! I have a sense of humor about my heritage, so whoever said this review isn't helpful either didn't like the movie and didn't approve of me saying I did, or they have no sense of humor.<br />There's a reason this movie is so unbelievably popular and highly rated: it's awesome!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is my favorite game. can't put it down. absolutely love this game.  great time waster. only wish it would give more coins.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Hard to put down thriller. Very good and fast story. Hope Puller will be back not to far from now.
B008VBYN80|4.0|its a pretty fun game and its a good time waster. the fighting system is pretty cool and all the units. I'm not that far but this is a a game I might stick with.
B008PE9GSA|3.0|Q:  Is it POSSIBLE for Rick Rubin to produce an album anymore and NOT ruin it and the artist he's producing?  A:  No, it's not possible.  Why does this man destroy  everything he touches?  And he's still considered rock royalty?  He started producing Linkin Park and they haven't put out a good album since Meteora/Reanimation.  Ditto for the Chili Peppers.  Now ZZ Top.  Not a bad album and definitely a return to their old sound, but that's not always a good thing.  La Futura is a  MISERABLE production.  Congratulations Rick, you must be so proud.  Can't you just retire and rest on your laurels already?  To ZZ Top - Get Bill Ham back.  Quick!  Or just let Billy continue producing.  But NEVER let Rick Rubin back in your studio!  This album will hold me for some new ZZ Top material, but hoping their next album does not contain RR's poisonous production \\"skills\\".
B008MEM24S|5.0|I think that everyone should play this amazing game because it is so much fun.There is so a lot of levels to have fun on.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game. Great to pass the time and a brain teaser. Ads don't get in the way and don't change the game play. I would recommend this game.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|although I'm still playing it, I absolutely love this game. the graphics are beautiful, the music haunting and it is overall (so far) a very good game.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Book one was interesting to see what actually goes through some peoples minds. Book two began to be predictable. Book three exists just to have another book to sell. Story and writing was lame. You knew every time they got in an elevator what they were going to do and how. I couldn't finish it.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is one of the best series I have read in a long time. Great characters, beautiful scenes, amazing writing!  I really enjoyed them
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Shinedown has really delivered with Amaryllis.  I thought they brought their best with Sound of Madness, but clearly I was wrong. I have been listening to Shinedown for a while now, all the way back to \\"Fly from the inside\\", and \\"45\\". If you have been a fan of them for a while I think it's becoming clear that their music is evolving, and for the better I think. This change happened back on the Sound of Madness album, which you can relate to some of their music on Amaryllis. Their music is also becoming more mainstream, which I think is nice because then you can hear them on the radio every once in a while. My favorite songs on Amaryllis would have to be Adrenaline, Bully, Nowhere Kids, and My Name. These are the faster songs on the album but there are definitely some good slow songs such as Amaryllis, Unity, and Through the Ghost. With that being said, I don't think there is a weak song on this album.  I think the beauty of the \\"new\\" Shinedown mix of fast and slow songs is that you can listen to them in a variety of settings. If you want some good workout music, some Shinedown songs will definitely get the job done. On the other hand, if you want to listen to some relaxing rock music, that is slower in nature, they offer that too. They have really crafted a unique mix, and as a fan it's relieving that they aren't one dimensional like some other rock bands. This album is very solid all around, and if your a rock fan I think it's a must have.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I flew through this book, and then re-read it. It had a drastic impact for me. I've read a ton of motivational and authors. Welch, Robbins, Napoleon Hill, Trump, and so many more. This was the best. Mark is giving out excellent mentor level information for a fraction of what it's worth, if you are willing to work, then this is billion dollar book, let me repeat that it's a $1,000,000,000 book. The fact that Mark is giving it to you strait, and is not worried about hearing himself talk so to speak) makes it all that much better. I bought copies for others and will buy more. If you love you, you owe it to yourself to buy this book, shut out everything you can and read it now.<br /><br />Patrick Edwards
0439023521|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B008VGWH4W In the Kingdom of Dragons: Rose and Thorne]] I'd say that anyone who enjoys reading fantasy should read this book.  The story is imaginative and original. The characters are strong with quirky personalities. Although violent in parts, there's no gore for gore's sake.<br />Catnis is an engaging heroine. I was rooting for her. The tension builds and the world the author creates is never boring. Highly recommended for adults and teens.<br />D. L. Burnett
0316228532|5.0|Not once did I think of Harry Potter while reading this book, and because of that it deserves a review based on its own merits, with no comparisons drawn with its sibling novels. The Casual Vacancy is captivating in every aspect and is sure to be set on my bookshelf of favourites for years to come. Each character has a deep backstory with realistic motivations behind their actions. You might not like everyone, but that is the whole point of the story. It is reality. Pagford isn't full of witty characters who have exhilarating adventures; it is a representation of real life, with its foul language and dubious intentions and each character has their own responsibilities to face or avoid.<br /><br />It is undeniably a book for grown-ups, but that being said; at no point is the language or behaviour of any of the characters jarring. With each chapter that passes you learn more about the characters, understanding the motives behind their sour personality or troublesome behaviour. Rowling covers a wide variety of difficult issues, such as self-harm, drug addiction and rape, and while it is a very dark novel, somehow it is simultaneously uplifting. Everything that happens is part of the world that we know, and dealt with in a manner that helps you to accept those parts, alongside all the good in the world. Aside from anything else, I'd recommend this book for the benefits it will surely have on your vocabulary alone, as Rowling has a true talent for using every word under the sun in an interesting and insightful manner.<br /><br />Reviewed by Elizabeth Wright on behalf of BestChickLit.com
0553386794|5.0|Those who enjoys reading epic fantasy would enjoy reading this book. George R R Martin's book has a complex world with many characters who all have their own agenda. I especially enjoyed his strong female characters and his use of children. The level of intrique is masterful, the writing polished, and the story well plotted. It does have a lot of characters.<br />Highly recommended for adults.<br />D. L Burnett
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Reading this book re-awakes all those lessons, feelings I had growing up and learning about the people who lived , worked, suffered through the difficult 30s and the horrors of World War (II).  Reading the first volume is not necessary although it too is a great read and helpful in understanding the lead up to the second volume.  Suggest you keep a pad and use a score card to keep relationships straight.  BOB
0812550706|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I felt Ender's pain all through his training. The stakes couldn't be higher--saving human-kind.<br />I met Orson Scott Card at a book signing, and he told the crowd how much he enjoyed writing this book. It shows!<br />Highly recommended for adults and young adults.<br />D. L Burnett
B008LSVL6U|5.0|This has been covered already by the 10 previous reviews before me, and if you like Steven Wilson's solo work at all or any of his work with Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, No Man, or his Storm Corrosion collaboration work?  Steven Wilson seems to touch on all of those sounds at different times in this concert, and you can add King Crimson into the mix.<br /><br />This is a superb Blu-ray DVD concert disc with it's video of showing 6 great musicians performing or with in it's slide projection show that is in sink with each song of this concert, and it really gives you a feeling of almost like being their at this wonderful live concert filmed in Mexico City, and it has a superb 5.1 DTS surround sound that is crystal clear with each, and every instruments being played.<br /><br />If you just heard of Steven Wilson recently please do not hesitate to purchase this wonderful live concert DVD, and if you are already a fan of Steven Wilson this is a must have for your collection. This concert DVD is just over 2 hours in length. Then you will experience seeing & hearing these 6 great musicians at work in this superb live concert DVD!
B007P06DOK|5.0|This item arrived in perfect condition and i would use this person again their service was very excellent what more can i say i love the cd and lost my copy so getting a new one at a great price was a no brainer
B000I8FTY6|5.0|Hugh Grant is at his best when he plays a cad! Those who enjoyed \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" for the father-son relationship that developed between the old man and the boy will enjoy this for many of the same reasons .... although this is more of a older/younger brother story. Hugh's character starts as a lonely self-interested bachelor hitting on single mothers desperate for attention, and ends up discovering that he too is missing something that only a more complicated human interaction can provide. Mostly a comedy, it still weaves between comedy and drama the way so many older movies use to. Never a dull moment.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book.   I have read almost 200 books this year, and I have to say it is truly original and entertaining. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author! Good job!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this app and have wanted it since my friend let me play on her ipod. This app will slow down sometimes and pause for no reason while you are playing... besides that i love it! :)
B008Y2IU12|4.0|I like the overall storyline. Stayed closer to the original tale told/read to me as a kid. The Visuals(CG) have been by far the best I have ever seen in any other movie in a longtime.Very Impressive in that sense. Good overall movie.Would recommend.
091581112X|5.0|This book is *THE BEST * spiritual book I have ever read! I came across it by accident one day, and once I opened the pages I never set it down. If your desire is to read a spiritual book filled with knowledge and guidance then you've come to the right place! Love & Light to you, Ms Sanaya Roman, you are truly a woman who has experienced the Other Side and was sent here to help us all to master our spiritual lessons in this lifetime.<br />THANK YOU, Ms Roman - YOU are a Blessing to us all
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This one of the best movies created about Aliens or other space life form. Since the first movie \\"Alien\\" was shown in 1979, there is no other movie can be better than it except the second movie \\"Aliens\\".I will not write about the four movies as there are a lot of good reviews on them. I do not feel cheated for spending on the Blue Ray set even I have purchased the DVD package earlier. The picture and sound are great and each disc contain two version of the same film. You will never regret on this purchase as it is really value for money. 20th Fox has put in a great effort on the Blue Ray package.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really do like the app, but I think that it just takes too long for you to get more coins and I'm broke(I have no money),so I cant pay real money for it and my parents wont buy them for me so I have to wait 30seconds to gt one coin
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Is the book getting fixed?!!! its not there.. says currently not availible... crying into my pillow... im dying... Dear Amazon... Fix It Soon Please!!!!
B0055HVDZ4|5.0|what's to say? Volume 4, is in the top three Black Sabbath albums. every song perfect and better than the last. truly an indispensable piece of music and I think a cornerstone album in heavy metal history. so many bands owe so much to just this slab of the Sabbath pantheon. Worth buying this version in vinyl if only for the cover, that beautiful defining cover. and the credits of course.  as the young folks say, this stuff is dope!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Wanted man was the typical cover to cover action thriller that I have come to expect from Lee Child.<br /><br />  Jack Reacher is a mysterious, complex, alluring character. Lee Child gets better with every novel. I can't wait for the next installment!
B001NLL0RW|4.0|Seichan is an awesome  character & hope to see her beyond the Sigma Force novels.<br /> loved every twist & turn
B009IJJ8UM|5.0|A fascinating new show with a several very creative twists on an old classic. The character interaction is going to be fun to watch develop.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those series' that I will always remember.  It just sticks with you after you finish. I really enjoyed it. Well written and<br />I could not put it down.  I also read the one called First Shift Part 6. Also a great book.  Can not wait for more by the Author!!<br />Hope he keeps them coming.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game for the price. Not too challenging, but not too easy either. Would recommend it for a fun rainy day game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great book and i can wait to get started on book 3. This book kept me up until 3 in the morning it was so good!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I enjoy normal and pocket editions of Minecraft. Normal has more blocks and more mobs, but PE is easier to use. Overall I think normal is better when you think about quantity and PE is better when you want something easier. I have no opinion for Xbox because I do not have an Xbox. This is MY opinion. Do NOT give me a ton of crud about it. You can say all you want about your opinion. I do not criticize others.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|Fast shipment, product was brand new/sealed.  My chihuahuas and I love this movie along with the first two.  Would be better if the cast was all the same as the first movie.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Overall, good book. The first half tells the author's story leading up to the UBL mission in Pakistan. The entire book provides good detail about SEAL Training and a handful of different missions in the past decade. I'd be curious to learn how current and ex-SEALS feel about this book and the details outlined.
B00976N384|4.0|Love the album but it's a little slower then what the regular Killers fan will be used to. I could personally go without the ballads. \\"Runaways\\" and \\"Deadlines and Commitments\\" make it all worth it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|What a cliffhanger!  Edward James Olmos was superb ans so convincing in this role.  The build up to the finale was perfect and the finale left so much about which to speculate.  The next season is definitely on my wish list!
B000FC0SIM|4.0|I had fallen out of reading Stephen King's work for many years until downloading On Writing. I'm a songwriter myself, not a novelist, but I found the kind of advice he gives in it to be quite relevant to my life and career as well.<br /><br />Also, the tone of the book, written in King's compelling narrative style, made it a highly enjoyable read, and the autobiographical aspects allowed me to get a better feel for what makes the guy tick.<br /><br />I have to admit I was pretty bummed about the pricing though. I would buy many more ebooks from legacy publishers if only they'd revisit their archaic pricing model. Paying $13 for data feels like being ripped off, and I wouldn't have  done it if I wasn't at the beach with nothing else to read.
0061692042|4.0|Perhaps its just me, but I thought Dick Ford was channeling Albert Camus in this novel. From the opening sentence, through the first person dialogue, and the existentialist theme, the work is evocative of Camus' \\"The Stranger\\".<br /><br />Of course the book stands on its own, and is a fine piece of writing, as one would expect from Mr Ford. There are plenty of reviews here to give one the gist of the novel, I just found the Camus connection of interest.
B006VJMZXY|3.0|The Kingmakers Daughter is an enjoyable historical novel.  Having read other novels dealing with the War of the Roses and the Lancaster/York division, I am always a little surprised to find yet another twist to the stories, eg. when Anne was taken by Richard Duke of York to the sanctuary at St Paul because her sister and brother-in-law were planning to keep her captive to take all her wealth from her, and Richard subsequently married her. It was a completely different version to what I had previously read, that she ran away by herself because the Duke of Gloucester was going to murder her, that her sister Isabel helped her to escape and that she lived a very ordinary life in a shop with a family, finally being found by Richard.<br />I would like to know what really happened!!  All the stories are slightly changed according to whose version we are reading.
B008PNBU30|1.0|I thought that the last album Three Days Grace put out, Life Starts Now, really wasn't very good compared to their previous two releases, but it's got nothing on Transit of Venus.  This stuff is awful.  If you don't believe me, go preview the tracks on iTunes.  I returned my CD to Target unopened - glad I was able to get my money back before I made the mistake of taking off the plastic wrapping.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|good fun but gets boring doing same old thing. played it every day for 2wks &amp; blue ring prize &amp;others never showed up. can't win something that's never presented. I uninstalled as it was boring by that time.
B007X98S82|5.0|I've been dying, since the release of Faust's first Bach album, to have her recording of the remainder of the sonatas and partitas. Faust's Bach fuses passion and intellect; not for her the effusive, vibrato-laden playing of most of the century, yet she doesn't go so far in the direction of period performance as to lose sight of the brilliance of the music. That is to say, her musical choices--her phrasing, her ways of playing chords, her dynamic range, her sparse vibrato, her varied modes of articulation--serve the music above all. After all, Baroque music is about structure, balance, contrast, and ornamentation--about the multifarious ways in which the microcosm fits into the macrocosm. Those who listen to Bach expecting to find in him the melting, Romantic melodies of  Tchaikovsky will look in vain. But those who listen instead for the unfolding of apparent simplicity, and for the hidden simplicity in apparent complexity, will find no end of pleasure in listening to these recordings. In short, I'm stunned by the magical beauty of Faust's Bach, and recommend these recordings wholeheartedly. I don't think they'll every find their equal.
B005FISBV2|1.0|Wow.  Thanks for the warnings guys.  Unfortunately I also managed to see the @#$@#$ spoiler by accident.<br /><br />So Showtime...you just lost a customer.  I came here to buy the season and realized...why would I want to support it after you F#### your viewer.<br /><br />Sorry Dexter, I'll miss you.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett does unimaginable research!!  And to keep it all organized, amazing.<br />Loved every page.<br />Can't wait for the third in his Triology.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book! My students love it and are eager for reading time instead of dreading it! Much like the Harry Potter series, these stories are a marvel!
B000VS4K2K|5.0|Space Ritual is about as close as it gets to being at a Hawkwind gig. Have been in The States 20 years and haven't seen them for a good while but my old mates still hit the annual tour. I've seen Hawkwind many times both at festivals and theatres. Space Ritual brings back memories of the long-haired, chemically altered, whirling dirvishes, lasers, lights and Newcastle Brown Ale that accompanied their shows. It is a magnificant moment of musical history, a bookmark in my life, it is bloody brilliant (and Lemmy's base playing holds the whole thing together). If my life could be any album it would be Space Ritual.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps me occupied :D love the way the games are and the music is the best! points are a bit too high but they are decent.
B004GCK6Y8|5.0|I am a film buff in general.  There are hundreds of movies that I have really enjoyed and seen multiple times over the years.  I could probably easily list several hundred that I would claim as favorites.  Two of my top favorites are Romeo And Juliet\\" and \\"West Side Story\\"  When I was a young kid I fell in love with Natalie Wood in \\"West Side Story\\".  When I was a high school senior, the Franco Zefferelli version of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" was released and over the next several months I took everyone, girls I was dating, family, friends - anyone I could talk into going, I took them to see that film because I wanted to give everyone I knew the gift of falling in love with that film as I had.  Back then, once a movie's run was over, it didn't come back out for years and there were no VHS tapes or DVDs so I actually bought a four album set of the complete audio soundtrack of the film and listened to it over and over.  It was quite a source of amusement for my family.<br /><br />So \\"Shakespeare In Love\\" was a perfect film for a more mature, grown up me thirty years plus after \\"Romeo And Juliet\\"  It is so brilliantly written and the acting is superb.  I think Mr Shakespeare would have been thrilled with this story of love and comedy.  The artistic team does an incredible job of creating a world that seems so genuine and authentic.  For me, I felt transported back to that time and place.  It was probably as close as I'll ever get to having a sense of what those times and some of the people were actually like.  And it's a riveting story with a first class cast.  It's one of those few films where, toward the end, I started sneaking looks at my watch because I didn't want it to end.  Definitely one of my top 5 or 10 all time favorites!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Amazing book. I will take you through yours injuries and it'll make you think about the way you run. For me it's been very educational.
B0041WZC1A|5.0|I too am one of those who was totally bowled over by the film in '82 and bought this CD as soon as it hit the stores.  It certainly does have a different feel to it than the actual film score but there are some beautiful cuts on this CD.  My favorites are \\"Memories of Green\\" and \\"Blade Runner Blues\\"  Both are haunting, melodic and sexy.  I've listened to this CD hundreds of times over the years.  I've seen each and every variation of the film as they've been slowly made available to the public through the years, I've purchased and listened to all of the different audio CDs that have come out, as well.<br /><br />For me there is something powerful about the first time one is exposed to a work of art where one feels a connection, there must be some sort of imprinting that takes place in the brain when you stumble upon something that touches you deeply.  Although I've seen all of the film versions multiple times, when I pull it out on a late Friday night to immerse myself in that world, the original theatrical version is the one I watch.  When I listen to \\"Blade Runner\\" in the car or on my iPod, the New American Symphony version is the one I flip to.  I know, heretical to the \\"purists\\", but when I saw the film several times in a theatre in '82 the original version is the one I saw and when I bought the CD, it was the \\"New American Symphony\\" version that I got hooked on.  And, overall, it's a very sexy CD, much more bluesy, melodic, darker, and more moody.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|wonderful graphics, no lag on my fire hd!  has kept me busy for 3 days straight and was so close to the end when it locked up on my crime investigation wall.  could't move or get out of it at all!  so here i am reinstalling so i can play it again.  thats how much i liked it!
B004NWHVVC|5.0|Couldn't agree more with Thomas. This album really sneaks up on you with just how good it is. Imagine if an alien, an octopus, and Jimi Hendrix ghost had a band together. I know that sounds weird, but it will capture you and not let go. It's indie, jazzy, funky, folky, and altogether otherworldly. A groundbreaking release from Connan Mockasin. Do yourself a favor and check out this terribly overlooked gem!
B003OACHJU|5.0|First of all let me state I am a huge Avenged Sevenfold fan and every they have is so much different but if it is not obvious enough that the Revs track fiction is a suicide note then your goofy but otherwise every song on this album is kick ass especially save me Rip Rev
1609611543|4.0|After reading this book I went off sugar, fructose and wheat.  Three weeks ago I couldn't get out of a chair without pain.<br />My knees were so stiff, as was my entire body.<br />All that is gone.  I can now move freely. There is no pain and I sleep like a rock.<br />Now I'm looking forward to the weight drop that is promised by Dr. Davis.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|If love screamo then you will love this album because thats basically all it is but thats not a bad thing this album is awesome especially Chapter Four, Second Heartbeat, and the best song on the album I wont see you tonight part 1

B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I bought this product for use with my Sony HDR CX550V which i consider a \\" light  , less than 1.0 LB\\" camcorder, as this product stated it can handle up to 5.0 LBS Cameras .But, i found it is impossible to make a acceptable balance  with my Sony HDR CX550V ( i have a very high expectation),so ....with my experience , i can say this product might work well for camera weight more than 3 LBS with gears or ....i dont know because i never got any other camera . Honestly , i think this OPteka SteadyVid PRO product looks pretty good and feel rock solid , but the engineering is poor ....when Optekas engineering this product so call PRO , they forgot to test  with manies kind of other \\" Light weight\\" camera and camcorder ( i dont know but guess ) that is why they only make three choices of  counter weights  .To me ,  counter weight correcting  is extremely important to achieve a perfect balance (to me ...the drop  time when test holding horizontal  should be  2 second to consider ok , if it drop faster than that then it will be swayed when in motion) ....too light = wont hold it up ....too heavy = sway when in motion ...with product so call \\"Steady , Stabilizer\\" even a little  less or more weight is unacceptable....I will make another test with the same camcorder and with  another Camera Stabilizer this weekend then i will review this again.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|A Super series but the disc that arrived that was bought from Amazon is only useable on DVD machines in the US and Canada but not in Australia (something only found in the small print) Couldn't watch a minute and left to sort out a return. Rip Off!
B003O86FMW|5.0|As a second book in a trilogy  you know from the beginning frustration awaits, this book makes  you love it as the tease it can only be. Hate to read the third because I know the end is nigh.
B004WQ59DG|1.0|Get the movie on conventional dvd,save money,and be happy.<br /><br />The movie is great!The blue ray version,however,is a rip-off.No special features other than the trailer,and many of these blue ray versions of 'Dredd' are not region 1 (U.S.A.) compatible...I love the movie,I just wish somebody cared enough to add features like cast and crew audio commentary.When you've made a great movie,you should take some pride in it.<br /><br />Feature length audio commentary is the most important special feature.If you've already seen the movie many times,watching it with audio commentary allows you to see the movie from somebody else's perspective,which makes the movie new again...Sly Stallone's audio commentary for the first Rambo movie is a great example for making something old new again.Watching Rambo while listening to Stallone talking about it was almost like seeing the movie for the first time.You gain a new perspective that you didn't have before.
0316228532|4.0|It took me a while to finish this book.  I almost put it down and didn't complete it before I had read 50 pages, so shocked was I by the perpetual f-bombs and vulgarities of the characters.  I honestly didn't like the book at all at first.  I'm glad I finished it, but I also told my 17 year old son that I didn't want him to read it.  It is very much a book for adults, and I'm concerned that parents will buy the book for their Potter-loving children.  It is an innocence-robbing book.<br /><br />Here's a theory I came up with when I was in the middle of the book.  I'm just tossing it out there.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling spent a decade writing about a world that Harry saved.  What if she had killed him off when Voldemort attacked him as a baby?  What would that world have then been like?  I'm proposing that here we have the non-magical answer to that question.<br /><br />I seriously tried to approach this book without taking the Potter series into consideration, but I found myself so longing for a hero that this is the conclusion that I came to.  Is Barry the non-magical version of Harry? (I think that the name similarity might be Freudian).  What happens in a world filled with people who are either narrow-minded or beaten down by life with no one other than themselves to pull them out?  I suggest that the Casual Vacancy is the absence of a Harry Potter.<br /><br />This book is not going to go down in history like the Potter books did, but I do think it has something important to say to us.  Rowling went out of her way to make us dislike the characters in this book at the beginning, but we gradually come to know them and I did come to feel empathy for many of them (not ALL of them!).  It is very much a book about class warfare, how unhealthy learned behaviors affect others, and the generation gap.  It does NOT have a happy ending.  I'm not sure how many of the characters experience positive growth in the story.  Rather than being a book in which characters we look up to uplift us, it is a book that seeks to have us understand those who may not be as fortunate as we.  What can we do to improve their lot?  How can we differentiate ourselves from the middle class folk in this book who treat the less fortunate with condescension and contempt?  The book made me take a hard look at myself.  Hence the 4 star review.  If you are an open minded adult reader, give it a chance.  FINISH IT!uplift us, it is a book that seeks to have us understand those who may not be as fortunate as we.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is full of excitement and suspense. When I started it, I knew that it would be a great book, but when I started reading The Mark of Athena, it was better than I thought it to be.
B008S4FZ6E|5.0|Wow! So much I didn't know about JT! As a teenage fan in the 80's, all I knew was the poster boy clean cut image that the music magazines put out. All the while he was struggling with demons and awful lifestyle choices.<br />I loved reading this book, although I feel some details were carefully written to perhaps protect some reputations.<br />Insight into the musical process of Duran Duran was also really interesting.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this is a great game.  one of the best I've played since I bought my kindle fire.  keep em coming BIG FISH.<br />the price was great too.
B003NX76BM|4.0|I actually have this book in my home library.  Loved the \\"search and rescue\\" aspect of the story, having a yellow lab, can relate to how a well trained dog can work.  I liked how it sort of was the \\"opening scene\\" so to speak - set the stage for the rest of the story.  Liked the intro. of the new neighbor and his puppy and how their friendship slowly became more involved.  The \\"jerk\\" that was stalking her was very methodical and in the end showed just how vulnerable people really are.  I really like Nora Roberts and plan on purchasing more of her great books.
0920668364|5.0|No words can describe how precious this book is! My mother bought it for my sister when she had her first child ( a beautiful baby boy) and it would bring me to tears each time I read it....I have a beautiful baby boy of my own now and I bought this book to read to him, and for him to have....It's so touching and it makes you feel so good about being a mother!!!<br /><br />I love this book!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was concerned that I might not like this book because of the violence, which I am not normally a big fan of even if there is a greater message, this book was pretty well done there were parts that made me cringe but the story was more than that!
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Having been a fan for some time now, and a veteran of 4 or 5 concerts, I am continually impressed by Joe Bonamassa's musical growth. Yes he's a brilliant blues-rock guitarist whose playing is flawless and exhibits a purity of tone and inflection to rival Eric Clapton, but moreso, he's a constantly exploring and growing player who brings new sounds to his rich tapestry of electric blues-rock. What strikes me the most is the influence of traditional and folk playing in his work: just listen to Bird on a Wire or The Ballad of John Henry, to name but two examples. Much has been said of how on Driving Towards the Daylight Joe rises to the challenge of breaking loose from his comfort zone, but really I think that each of his last 5 or 6 albums have explored new and varying musical territory, while remaining anchored in his brand of electric blues. In Driving towards the Daylight, Joe brings a cohesion to his work, so the entire album flows beautifully. Standouts to me are \\"Dislocated Boy\\" and \\"Heavenly Soul,\\" but really there isn't a weak song in the mix. Moreover, if you are not yet familiar with this brilliant 35-year-old musician, this is a great place to start.
0525953728|5.0|The first half of the book is about the training and experience of a Navy Seal. It's interesting and necessary to validate a book.  You can't expect to get right into the raid without background.  A 100 page book won't sell.  The second half covers the raid on Osama Bin Laden. The book is well written, very interesting, and most probably based on the truth, which is the author's objective .  Unfortunately, the publicized reports we were given were politicized.  This is a warriors account of the action.  Assuming his teammates are supportive, I am glad the author had the courage to print the truth and without revealing national secrets.

B008I34YYY|5.0|Come on people!!!!! Nazis on the moon?!?!? If that alone doesn't get you interested move along to some penguin movie.<br /><br />Intentionally campy, this is a soon-to-be cult classic.  Interesting and parodying characters.  Great creative concept and phenomenal special effects on a shoestring budget.<br /><br />We had fun bringing it to our local theater and now fun watching it again and again to catch the subtle nuances.  Palin as president.  Send ups of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" and \\"Downfall\\" (among other movies).  Having fun with our political ways.<br /><br />The idea that a Nazi could be sweet and innocent among typically barbaric stereotypical Nazis....and sexy too!!!<br /><br />Too many things to mention.  Oscar, no.  Tons of interesting scI-fi, war and comedy, yes!!!!
0345803485|1.0|I've heard a rumor that this was actually written by a ghost-writer employed by J. Q. Rowlings, intended as an insert in an upcoming novel for adults. In the novel one of the characters talks about the junk being published and read these days, and uses the \\"Harry Rotter\\" books as an example of that. Another character mentions a vampire novel called \\"Dusk\\". Another character then hands another character the book \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" as an example of the really bad stuff, much worse than \\"Rotter\\" I, II etc, or Vamp I, II etc.<br /><br />Then another character points out that another character is reading the whole thing online, and another character asks if it can be deleted. Then another character says, \\"then please do so\\". Then another character deletes it. Then another character says \\"Glad we live in a parallel universe\\". Then another character says \\"Yeah, you better believe it. Try living in the real one, where every ditz and her sister sends c--- like this around in email attachments\\".
B00563M11M|5.0|Another great addition to Terry Pratchett's Discworld stable. Can't get enough of his work and always hope for more about Rincewind and the Unseen University, perhaps that will come next year! Meanwhile, Snuff provides entertainment, laughs and is though-provoking in TPs own inimitable way - it is after all about racism (speciesism) and how society deals with it. A great read.
B008DB3N5W|1.0|Uninspired garbage.  Such a disappointment. I have been with Manowar since their first album and have been waiting for this one to come out.  I couldn't be more unhappy.<br />Uninspired is the best way to describe it.  It seems so half-assed when compared to their previous albums.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have been totally taken by this series. I can agree it is like Fifty Shades of Grey and not. This was a totally thrilling series to read and can't wait till Christmas to read the next one. This series of books kept me wanting more and I could not stop reading it. Let's just say that it has helped me in my path of things. I now have a better relationship with my husband because of this series. Thank you, Sylvia Day....
B003DWC6IQ|5.0|This has been by far one of the best novels I have ever read.  From beginning to end you have absolutely no idea what will come next, which keeps you flipping the pages...a must.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game features puzzles of varying difficulty, hidden object minigames, and first-person point and click adventure gameplay. Two negatives for this game are corny (but clearly spoken) voiceovers and a cliched villain :spoilers: (an evil &quot;preacher&quot;) :end spoilers: .<br /><br />Overall, a fun game. 4/5.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was another well done story! I felt like I was experiencing all Eva's emotions throughout the novel. The story ended in a good place, making me love Gideon even more despite how difficult he could be. For people new to this series, I  would like to say do not go into it thinking it is another Fifty Shades. The experiences and emotions of the characters are very different. Both series are wonderful in their own way. In conclusion, read this!
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|such a great movie. saw it years ago and it still holds its own. the cast and writing was right on!....LOVED IT!
B004LUS390|1.0|Let me clarify. I've been using Sketchbook Mobile since this July, and it's worked great all this time, right up until the latest auto-update in the past week to version 1.5.0. If it were just the top-bar changing from white to black and the icons changing, I wouldn't have minded. What I do mind is that now the brush sensitivity is way off, buggy and lagging to the point of the program being worthless when it comes to drawing. To test things out, I downloaded the free Mobile Express version, which hasn't been updated in quite some time. Guess what? It responds and works exactly the way I remember Sketchbook operating on my Kindle before, just without any of the essential features the full app has.<br /><br />Apparently on Google Play and other venders, the Sketchbook Mobile app has been updated to 1.5.2, but Autodesk hasn't gotten around to doing the same for the Kindle. I don't know if that further update will fix the problems I'm experiencing, but it certainly can't help. Amazon should either contact Autodesk ASAP and get the latest version online, or see if it's possible to make the earlier, lagless version of the app available for users like myself who can't get the current build to work on their Kindle.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|This review is written by a totally blind consumer, so don't expect much pertaining to DVD picture quality.  I'm more interested in story.  So if you're still interested, read ahead by all means.<br /><br />  I jumped on the Supernatural bandwagon when season 4 premiered, so I didn't get to see season 1 until I bought the first 4 seasons on dvd in anticipation of s5's release.  I have to say for a first season, I was very impressed.  I'm a sucker for all things related to horror and the premise of this show is just so bloody addictive.<br /><br />  You're introduced to this happy family in the first scene and you're thinking,\\"Ok, so what could happen here?\\"  Evil supernatural force breaks into the house, kills mommy, and sends dad and sons running for their lives. And this is only the teaser of the very first episode!  Dad trains sons to become hunters of all ghoulies, ghosties, and long leggedy beasties, and things that go bump in the night. They spend the first season looking for whatever killed mommy aka Mary Winchester.  If I had seen this masterpiece of a series from episode one, I would have been hooked along with all the other viewers.  Well, I was from s4 episode 1 but that's a review for another day.<br /><br />  All that to say that this series is extremely addictive and if you've never seen it but have been meaning to pick this first season up, you won't regret it.  Now I'm not much for series with a multitude of one shot episodes.  I enjoy things a bit more serialized, but this show starts delivering more continuity after the first 8 or so episodes.  The viewer is usually left speculating what is going to happen next even if the episode is one of those featuring a monster/vengeful spirit of the week rather than addressing the overall story arc of the season.<br /><br />  This series is allot of fun to watch after dark.  Yeah, I know what you're thinking.  Sure blind people get jittery at night when watching shows like this.  At least I do.  But that's part of the fun, in my opinion anyway.  And you gotta love the writing this season as well.(Eric Kripke is a genius.)  Don't get me started concerning the talented Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles who portray hunters Sam and Dean Winchester.  And let's not forget Jeffrey Dean Morgan who plays John, their tough as nails father.  We're also introduced to Bobby Singer, portrayed by the incredible Jim Beaver, at the end of season 1. Singer is a fellow hunter as well as a friend of the Winchester family.  Bobby ties with Sam and Dean in terms of favorite characters.  I could write pages upon pages pertaining to how much I enjoy both characters and actors, but don't have the time.<br /><br />  Recurring villains, you ask?  Oh yes indeed, there are.  That's another one of the things I love about this show.  Baddies aren't dispensed with and never return in this show.  Well, sometimes they are.  But you never know which villain you'll see popping up again later on down the line.  I love a good series which isn't so cut and dried.  And I really can't stand it when episodes are all wrapped up at the end with nice little bows on said packages. Hence why I love Supernatural so much.  Always leaves you wanting more, and it delivers.<br /><br />  So if you like scary/suspenseful action packed edge of your seat types of series with a continuous story arc spanning season after season, pick up season 1 and give this series a go.  I will warn you though that season 1 ends on a tremendous cliffhanger.  My word, how did fans endure the wait between seasons?  I don't think I could have done that.  Anywho, you probably won't stop after season 1 if this is your first viewing, so have a blast and happy hunting, folks. Long live the Winchesters!  See you in my season 2 review: coming soon.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|I sure hope this will look SUPERB on the Bluray transfer....<br /><br />Since it is an 1990 flick, I believe they will do that...<br />it is mostly colorful and extraordinary, so I am a believer this<br />time that it will be great again...<br /><br />Looking forward to getting this the day it comes out!!<br />hopefully the PRICE will dip and dip to become an bargain for<br />everyone!! =)

1451696205|5.0|This is the story about socially awkward and lonely Charlie. The whole book is a series of letters written in August 1991 - August 1992 from Charlie to someone who will listen and understand. Letter by letter he writes how nervous high school makes him and how he becomes friends with Sam and Patrick.<br /><br />Sam and Patrick play a great roll in Charlie's life. They are step brother and sister but they get along incredibly well, they are always together. They introduce Charlie to house parties, The Horror  Rocky Picture Show, new music and basically, what it is to be a teenager.<br /><br />Charlie also goes to therapy and his psychologist tries to figure out if something happened in his childhood that is making him act like he does.<br /><br />This story is all about family conflicts, friends, falling in love for the first time and -- growing up.<br /><br />[To watch my video review click here]<br /><br />What I Thought<br /><br />I thought this book was AMAZING! I really liked all of the characters but most of all Charlie's character. He is a great person that is very very confused about growing up. He has no idea how he is supposed to act around girls. He tries to be very nice to everyone and was very likable even though he is very awkward.<br /><br />I loved that throughout the book he explored new music and books. He reads books that now I want to read myself. Music, that I am now very curious about. I just loved how both music and books are such a staple in our lives and how they can affect someone this day and age the same way they did 20 years ago.<br /><br />It was great that it was set in the 1990′s just before technology started changing the way we communicate, how we know of music, and how we interact with each other.<br /><br />I also thought this was sort of the contemporary version of Catcher In The Rye (also one of my favorite books)<br /><br />So...

1938469003|3.0|If you like beer history, you'll like this book. About half of it is history of the IPA from 1800 to present. The history is well written and extremely well researched. If you are the sort who reads the beer history blog Shut Up about Barclay Perkins, you will enjoy the book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I found the book lacking in real tips for brewing better (modern) IPAs. There is good recipe information for brewing historical IPAs circa 1800-1850 (including water chemistry), but none of the recipes are scaled for the standard 5 gallon homebrewer setup. I myself am looking forward to using the information to brew a heavily hopped Burton IPA in the near future. There are also excellent recipes for some of the best-known modern IPAs in the country. All in all, about 50 pages of recipes. These recipes are from the horse's mouth, so to speak, and should be much more accurate than anything you find on the internet.<br /><br />There is some style discussion for double IPAs, black IPAs (or dark cascadians, whatever you want to call them), and Belgian IPAs, but it really doesn't amount to much and is more of a side note than a main focus.<br /><br />There is good brewing information in the book, but if you have already read Palmer's How to Brew and Yeast by White and Zainesheff (both of which are excellent books all homebrewers should read), I don't think there will be anything new to you. In the end, it is a nice addition to the interested brewer, but definitely not a must-have. Cheers.

B009AJD5E0|1.0|This film is a prime example of why it rarely, if ever, goes good for a director to write a film, which is of course why writers tend to... To say that this film is boring is an understatement, in fact the previews are far more interesting and alluring than watching this garbage, and I would also state that watching paint dry would be about as fun while being less painful.<br /><br />The fake Scottish accent, when seems to come and go, even transform into a British one briefly, then an American one briefly and back into fake Scottish...well thats what to expect I suppose when the main actress isnt Scottish, American, or British and the viewer is expected to not pay attention.<br /><br />Much of this film is 'filler' where the director attempts to add rather than remove unnecessary segments, or as a professional director would to find the best segment and still minimize for transition---here is it the opposite \\"lets have as much nonsense in between two points that the audience is (yawn) in suspense hopefully\\".<br /><br />As stated before, watch paint dry and one of the previews for this film every 10 minutes and youve pretty much seen the film, saved money from total waste on garbage, and of course have a painted wall.
B007THA4FI|5.0|this book is not for the shallow reader who merely wants entertainment. this book will uncover deep dark secrets in your own mind you didnt even know you had.<br />nonetheless, despite the fact it will make you squirm, well worth reading and receiving the messages regarding human nature at its best and worst.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|I'm not saying this because I'm an avid heavy metal fanatic, but I'm saying it because it is true, Minaj is a waste of air waves.  She has absolutely no talent and is ugly nonetheless.  I have heard a few of her songs and they are just a complete ear sore and worse than nails down a chalkboard.  I'm not remotely sure why people would waste they money on this talentless trash when there are plenty of other hip hop people who are very talented like Prozak, Tech N9ne, Stevie Stone, etc.  Minaj is a disgrace to music in general and so are Lil Wayne and Kanye West.

B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|I'm just going to flat out give my honest opinion.  I love LP and have since their beginnings.  They are selling out people, their sound has spiraled into crap.  I'm not hoping for a Hybrid Theory remake or anything like that, they have really softened up to appeal to the mainstream.  Bands like LP are starting to appeal to an audience that wants softer, more toned down music as that is now the stupid trend.  This is one reason I listen to underground heavy metal.  I look for edge, intensity, attention grabbing.  This album does not have that at all.  This is actually a rather boring album.  The only reason for two stars is because I always love Chester's vocals, no matter how dull are boring LP gets.  I don't love them anymore though I still listen to their first two albums.  Come on LP, redeem yourself, I'm begging you!!!
B004XANKVO|2.0|I have always been a thule fan with bicycle racks and can vouch for their quality for all the other products. Going ont he same line I bought this bag. Loved this bag from the day it arrived, tons of pockets, good padding for laptop and space. Now after one month of usage one of the shoulder belt has started to come off from the edge. this is disappointing just in a month its showing sign of wear and tear. I have spent 130$ on this bag!! its not a cheap bag so I dont expect cheap quality standard from thule either. It would be nice if someone from thule get in touch with me and resolve my problem!!!!
B00005A46T|5.0|Some people would say they're ashamed that Slipknot is dubbed heavy metal.  Well, their previous album and this one are in fact heavy metal, they're newer work is far from it.  This is definitely the best Slipknot album they ever made, and all time classic metal album!!
0316228532|1.0|This is the first book (kindle version) that I seriously considered returning.  While I have bought bad books in the past, I at least bought them in hard cover so I could donate to someone else or to a library.  I read widely in many different topics, types, from fiction to non-fiction, from classics to new ideas.  It is almost like I want to scream...enough building of the characters already...is anyone ever going to do something???? I will admit I am about 1/2 through the read...and I find myself starting to skim...so I can just say I finished it...sure wasted my money.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|My ex wife's ex boyfriend got me into FFDP when they surfaced.  I have followed Ivan since his Motograter days, and this is the best direction he could ever go in.  This album is just a sucker death punch to your ear drums.  The same way the other two albums are, they never cease to impress.  Ivan has a controllable anger issue and it's as if he vents on all the tracks about something, I love that about artists and bands today!!

B007X4N0DU|1.0|I was always a mediocre fan of POD, but this album is just straight up crap.  I have read that people are so upset that Sonny dropped the F-bomb.  So what, he cussed, oh no, the world will end now.  Seriously?  It's part of the English language, get over it.  Anyway, this album is garbage to begin with, they have very poorly distorted guitars and it's almost a monotone sound with a low volume.  I wouldn't waste my money on this crap!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|can't get enough of this game! i don't like the boards that require filling in more space than necessary but that's my only complaint.
B008B7OQHM|3.0|They already did something earlier, a greatest hits and live album.  If it's in honor of Mr. Grey then that's one thing, but come on Slipknot, you've done this before, you don't need to repeat this.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's fun but you don't get very many coins when offline.  otherwise it's fun!! Grate for all ages. Get it.
B00000JCOV|5.0|A good friend of mine introduced me to this album when I was a freshmen in high school (in 1999) and I loved it!!!  I would consider this one a classic but their next effort \\"Iowa\\" is a heavy metal classic among all.  Yeah there are a few weird moments, but that's what adds to the uniqueness that is Slipknot.  I don't like their newer albums as I feel they are selling out but this earlier stuff is timeless!!!

0739366408|5.0|World War Z - Where were you during the war with Zack?<br />We tend to look back on historical events as single points, solitary entities amidst an endless sea of others. The assassination of Kennedy, where were you? The Twin towers, where were you? The Israeli voluntary quarantine, where we you? These are not hermits in history though. Dominoes fell in cascading events leading up to the big splashes that we memorize where we are, what we're doing, and how out lives have changed. In World War Z, Max Brooks has managed to capture that feeling. We dance through the events leading up to the horrors of the zombie uprising and the lives that were lost and the ones who lived through it. From early musing in China to spy networks through the old cold war nation states, so many people have stories to tell. In the end, one by one, their puzzle pieces fit together and we learn more of the truth of what was, and how much worse it could have been. Wherever you were during the crisis that almost made Homo sapiens another extinct breed on the evolutionary scale, you'll find something touching in this documentary book.<br />World War Z is a wonderful Imagined documentary of the aftermath of a decade long war waged against the undead. Set during the second quarter of the 21st century, the novel takes the form of the aftermath of a UN probe into the events that lead to the outbreak, the actions of people responsible and impacted by the events of the world government, and the changed world after the end of the war and how people are cooping. Max Brooks writes himself into the novel as a researcher analyst gathering the information for the report and eventually succeeding in presenting a very emotional and heart filled report. From the first outbreak and the doctor who witnessed patient zero, a soldier on the front lines, the former VP of the United States, and activists throughout the world.<br />One of the strongest parts of the story is that it isn't US centric. While the US has the largest percentage of voices, people throughout the world have their voices heard through the report. Cuba, China, Europe, south Asia islands, Canada, and other nations throughout the world share a piece of their presence in the war. Max takes care at looking at the effects the war has on the economies and futures of various nation states and how they not only coop with the outbreak but how their culture and outlook are infected by the spread fleeing masses of humanity. The plague years bring more than just the undead in terms of changes.<br />I would recommend World War Z to fans of zombie mythos who want to see a story outside of the typical last man standing stories many other zombie themed novels present. Max's work creates a realistic view on an impossible situation. The reactions of countries and cultures as the events shift back and forth leave the planet convulsing in death throes. While the very existence of the book provides the answer on if humanity survived, reading the path the people of the world take in order to make it through at all costs will leave you amazed with awe and disgust. This book works great with both text and audio editions.e largest percentage of voices, people throughout the world have their voices heard through the report.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book was a surprise for me. Having that many millions of people who read it, I thought I would give it a chance. What I didn't expect was that it was going to be bad written, with lots of repetitions (her favourite sentence was Holy Crap) and with no quemestry between the characters. It was actually BORING! The only interesting thing that I found on this book was the emails they sent to each other. I cannot understand why people want to read a second and yet a third part!
0345803493|5.0|This book has me glued to my chair as I cannot put it down.  The characters are absolutely intrigueing and I recommend it highly.  The story is not for everyone but it sure satisified my need for curling up with a good fantasy.

I am not that great in Maths but the simple examples quoted in your book really boosted my confidence and now I am trying mental maths in my day to day life. The case studies are excellent. This book has the perfect recipe for getting multiple job offers in the world of Consulting provided one is fulfilling the minimum essential criteria in terms of qualification and experience.

B000A3VTT8|5.0|Why?<br />Because the recent 'star' sets simply overshadowed this 1981 La Scala recording.<br />My first Cenerentola was Bartoli/Gimenez.  A perfectly good performance, with Corbelli as Don Magnificio.  Bartoli looked and sounded fresh in that recording, and she IS Italian! As Ramiro, a not too young Raul Gimenez sings wonderfully in true bel canto style. So I thought - well, Prince Charming, that's about it (i.e. there's none such in REAL operatic world).<br />Then I got Florez and DiDonato's 'cartoon' set.  Well, let me admit it - I did not watch that one in one sitting.  It is simply TOO much - what horrific sets! And DiDonato is no Cinderella, and Florez is too earthly a Prince - not tall, not masculine-voiced, though singing very floridly and fluently. The dramatic impact of this production is simply way too low.<br />Then I got a much better viewing of the MET Cenerentola, with Garanca as (eventually) the REAL Cindarella, both in looks and singing. The cast performed SO WELL that I forgot entirely about Brownlee's Prince, who was neither charming, nor tall, nor regal looking, but who sings adequately.<br />My experience with Rossini's La Cenerentola, therefore, is rather drab.<br />Until I watched this one - what a jaw-dropping performance and terrific production, as well as top-rate shooting.<br />The camera work deserves special commendation. In the romantic scenes, the shots are close - and it works SO well in this production, since we have here two MOST credible Cinderella and Prince Charming in the persons of Frederica von Stade and Franciso Araiza. In short, my hopes IN La Cenerentola are restored.<br />The acting is terrific - Desderi and Montarsolo are simply the best exponents of Italian buffa style, just as Alberghini and Corbelli in the MET production.<br />While Frederica von Stade is not as proficient as Rossinian mezzo as either Bartoli, DiDonato or probably even Garanca, her singing is adequate, and her acting is wonderful here. La Cenerentola is a bit difficult to stage, since mezzos are generally tall ladies, and Rossinian tenors not known for their height.<br />We have the big exception in the Bartoli/Gimenez production, but then back to the big reverse in the MET with a tall and slender Garanca and a short (and fat) Brownlee. Florez is barely the same height as DiDonato, who somehow looked more like Angelina's mother than Angelina herself, alas.<br />So visually this La Scala production of von Stade and Araiza is well-neigh the IDEAL combination.<br />Admittedly, von Stade has some vocal limitations here. Her Rossini is not, vocally, in the same league as Valentini-Terrani, Ann Murray, Agnes Baltsa or Joyce Didonato, let alone Cecilia Bartoli. While some people took far too seriously on Araiza's aspirated coloraturas, it is in fact an old vocal technique that is seldom employed for want of vocal proficiency in many modern singers.  Now, with Bartoli being the foremost 'aspirated coloratura' exponent, this aspect can safely be put to rest. Still, purely in terms of vocal proficiency in Rossini, I would opt either for DiDonato/Florez, Bartoli/Gimenez or even Garanca/Brownlee, since von Stade is barely adequate vocally as Angelina and is no match for the other three mezzos who are all Rossini experts.  For the strongest vocal combination of this work, go for Ferro's CD of Francisco Araiza/Lucia Valentini-Terrani.<br />Having said that, a La Cenerentola production without a pair of convincing leads is simply doomed to failure, however vocally brilliant, and I have seen much more flops of this opera's productions than successes.  This La Scala performance WILL definitely stand unsurpassed.s a bit difficult to stage, since mezzos are generally tall ladies, and Rossinian tenors not known for their height.<br />We have the big exception in the Bartoli/Gimenez production, but then back to the big reverse in the MET with a tall and slender Garanca and a short (and fat) Brownlee.

B00452J5IW|5.0|This was nominated for a Hugo award? A bunch of drugged up hippies hijack a starship which of course has little or no security, and take off into space to spread love, peace and polypharmacy all while doing impersonations of Cheech and Chong!<br />I wondered about the people doing the nominating for Hugo awards until I saw the nominations in that category for that year also included Firesign Theater's \\"Dont Crush That Dwarf...\\".<br /><br />Ok, now the tunes. Awesome!! Sunrise (Grace and Jack Casady at their firey best) alone is worth the price of admission. The righteous rage of the 70's comes through on almost every tune. But who would have thought that the line about a \\"grade B movie star governor's war\\" would be about a future president. Shoot, they may have helped get him elected with that tune.<br />The exception to the political rage is The Baby Tree, the song I sang to my baby to get her to sleep. She will be twisted when she grows up!<br /><br />I wore out several vinyl copies before I was able to find the CD. It is still one of my favorites. Ignore the story line. Put your fist in the air, shout antiwar slogans, feel the heat of the 70's again and enjoy.

B0068THAGY|2.0|The performance by the actors is great; there are moments that are quite touching.  But the story plot, ET type, is not clearly laid out, and sometimes quite inconsistent.  I would say if you want to watch the movie for effects--OK, for story--not really.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am so happy with this book! I absolutely loved it. The end...the cliffhanger... It drove me mad for an hour then I got over it. I know Percabeth will be fine, they're both great warriors. What I hate is that I have to wait a whole 'nother year before The House of Hades comes out!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT is what's gonna drive me crazy.
B005H5H3LW|2.0|Come on Amazon! Every other foreign film states the languges available in the 'Product Description' except this one? I feel cheated. Subtitles are fine IF you can really sit down and watch the film.  Often, I need to multitask and can't contantly watch the screen. So, an English dubed version works great.  When time (or the movie) justifys watching it with subtitles, great, I can be an elitist and say I enjoyed the film in the original language.  But, back to the point: Amazon needs to get serious and make sure the available languges are stated in the Product Description.  It strikes me that this important piece of information was 'forgotten' so Amazon could sell a few additional DVDs.  Space Battleship Yamato is a good film, but hardly a classic, one-of-a-kind film that HAS to be viewed only in the original language. OK, you got me and I bought a copy thinking an English language option was available ... but, hey, Amazon management lost my respect.  Now that I got that off my chest ...<br /><br />The movie plot and special effects are pretty good. Too bad the DVD producers were too cheap to add an English language option. This film really deserved that respect.  Especially at the price they are asking for a single copy.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I don't usually write negative reviews, but this book was a huge disappointment.  The characters were stereotypes.  There was little in the way of plot, and everyone in the book was miserable.  Many were actively trying to make others miserable.<br /><br />I wonder if JK Rowling just tried to write something as unlike the HP novels as possible.  If that was her goal, she succeeded.  Her talent could be put to better use.<br /><br />And yes, I read the whole thing.

0812993292|5.0|I LOVED this novel. My only regret is that my life became insanely busy while I was reading this wonderful novel so I was ridiculously slow to finish it. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry deserves to be gobbled up in a couple of sittings, and not over two weeks (which is the longest it has taken me to read a novel in years). Sentimental, subtle, mysterious, nostalgic, and heartfelt, this novel tugs at the heartstrings and makes you think.<br /><br />The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry is a slower story, but the emotion, the subtlety are intense. You can't help but think about your life, and you cannot help but hope and pray that your life doesn't end up as one dimensional as Harold's and that's you'll feel like your life doesn't amount to much as Harold does. This is a novel that makes you ponder your existence so be forewarned. It is definitely not all doom and gloom though, so don't let that stop you from picking this one up. Just the opposite in fact. It's gloriously tragic and uplifting at the same time and might unlock dormant memories as you journey alongside Harold Fry.<br /><br />Harold Fry is an unlikely hero. He's a typical older British man - quiet, serious and reserved, and there is just something about him that you can't help but root for. He wants to do something with his life and his quiet determination to walk to Queenie is admirable and at times baffling. All the characters in this novel are intriguing and fascinating, especially all the  people Harold meets along his modern day pilgrimage.<br /><br />This novel skips back and forth from Harold's story to his wife, Maureen's perspective, and is handled expertly. I loved that we are treated to her side of the story and privy to her transformation alongside her husband's. Their relationship is the cliched one you typically hear of - been married for decades, are like ships passing in the night, have no connection anymore, and are sleeping in separate rooms. It is only as the novel progresses that we discover their relationship is not as cliched as we were led to believe and the reasons for their predicament is gradually unveiled at exactly the right times. At first Maureen's character annoyed me somewhat, but as the novel progressed, I grew to understand her tough exterior and began rooting for these two passing ships to reconnect.<br /><br />There are a few shockers in this one that I wasn't expecting and more than a few lines that made me rock back on my heels and go 'wow'.  I shed a few tears and I loved how this one made me think and that it was such an unusual, unpredictable story. I can't wait to read more by Rachel Joyce! Definitely pick this one up if you're looking for something different!<br /><br />Thank you to Doubleday Canada for our review copy!  All opinions are our own.
B0094OLJD0|5.0|This album has been on repeat since I first heard it on NPR's First Listen.  I was lucky to see them in concert last week.  What a great dynamic - both on the album and on stage.  They bring out the best in each other.
1401322786|3.0|This was my first Mitch Albom novel. Somehow I've never gotten around to reading The Five People You Meet in Heaven or any of his others so I jumped at the chance to review The Time Keeper when it appeared on Netgalley. I can see how prolific Albom has become, but The Time Keeper didn't resonate with me as much as I wished it had and I love me a good fable (The Alchemist, my all time fave).<br /><br />The concept of The Time Keeper fascinated me. Time. I never have enough of it. Or I waste it. Or I wish there was more. Or I want perfect moments to slow down to savour or to speed up terrible moments to avoid the pain. How all these thoughts and feelings are all encompassed in this novel fascinated me and is utterly relatable, but eventually I found myself wanting more. Slow down and enjoy the moments as a theme is a predictable one and one I had hoped Albom would explore further, but when this ultimate theme is revealed, the novel ends and I was left feeling a bit ripped off.<br /><br />I knew from the epilogue how things wrapped up, but I wanted to see it and feel it. I wished that the novel went further and showed Sarah and Victor when they returned back to their lives. It would have given this novel so much more punch in my opinion. I didn't care as much for Dor, Father Time, as I did the two mortals, Sarah and Victor, so maybe that's why. My heart did lift at the end though.<br /><br />This is a ridiculously quick read, at only 240 pages, many of which have sections that have great gaps in spacing as well as many chapter endings, so it's probably under 200 with all the spacing. I read this in a day, probably under two hours and because of this, it really made me want more from the ending.<br /><br />Thank you to Hyperion for our review copy!  All Opinions are our own.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|The album isn't the engineers fault.  The producer was either stoned or stone deaf.  This is why labels have staff producers.  Unfortunately a great producer has to take the rap for this one.  But I think this has her husbands finger's all over it.  Try Mr. Costello.

B0050R0XEG|4.0|I got this for my 9-year-old who is very mechanically-oriented and great at putting Lego together. He put it together without help over the course of about a week, and he was thrilled with the results. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that, like other reviewers have said, the front roof keeps collapsing. I tried a rebuild and removed the front windows, which made it more stable, but I can understand the reviewer who wanted to throw it at the wall! I did, too! It seems that it's a design flaw that Lego should correct; otherwise, this is an interesting, detailed model that's an out-of-the-ordinary Lego design!
B002PNDEXK|4.0|If you are a Jane Austen fan, great movie.  I was concerned Emma Thompson was too old for the role, but she did such a great job acting, you didn't notice.  The same for Alan Rickman.  Hugh Grant was great as well.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love it! This book was even better than the first if that could be possible. Once you start reading you wont be able to put this book down. So... you better hang on tight because Sylvia Day will take you on one heck of a roller coaster ride when reading Reflected in You. Gideon and Eva's story will make you laugh, cry, want to pull you hair, shake them, then smile cause when they love they love hard. Their relationship and love is obsessive and twisted but you'll root for them too get it right no matter how bad things look. Loved how it ended and December can't get here fast enough for me! Job well done.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This was an Amazon PRIME rental streamed to my TV. The movie was flawlessly delivered in HD with solid audio performance. No vid-audio sync issues and instantly being able to view a movie is just too cool! For this reason alone it gets a 5-star nod. As for the movie content...well it is a cool movie. If you are a fan of the books that this movie is based, you will have your own opinion about how well the movie translates from the book to the big-screen and no touting from this review will sway you one way or the other. What I will say about the movie: It's very much worth the watch! Rent it? Yeah for sure - then you'll likely want to watch it again....so consider a buy option!
B009FOBMBI|5.0|I absolutely love this album I didn't think it could beat One X but In my opinion it did. These guys are truly talented and have come a long way.

B008KWHM6U|4.0|Two Door Cinema Club, the Northern Ireland-based indie-rock band, has lived the dream these last couple of years: after a well-received inital EP release in 2009, their debut album \\"Tourist History\\", released in 2010, became an almost-immediate hit in the indie-rock scene. The band took to touring, endless touring, in support of the album, and built a reputation as a more than solid live band. Now comes Tow Door's eagerly awaited decond album.<br /><br />\\"Beacon\\" (11 tracks; 40 min.) starts off with a very nice, upbeat \\"Next Year\\", one of the best tracks on here. \\"Handshake\\" follows, an equally happpy-go-lucky dance track, as does \\"Wake Up\\", with upfront drums and bass. What a great 1-2-3 beginning of the album! \\"Sun\\" shines next, and the first half of the album concludes with \\"Someday\\" (1st single), which sounds like it came straight from \\"Tourist History\\". I rate the first half of the album 4.5 stars. The second half kicks off with \\"Sleep Alone\\", and it continues the hard-charging ways of the first half. There are several slower songs on the second half, including \\"Settle\\" and \\"Spring\\". The album concludes with the title track, a beautiful pensive tune. I rate the second half of the album 3.5 stars.<br /><br />In all, this is quite the nice follow-up/sequel to \\"Tourist History\\". In the pre-release buzz, I had read somewhere that the new album was going to be a lot more \\"introverted\\" than the debut album, and to be honest, I feared the worst. But now having listened to this multiple times, I can say that, yes, it is a bit more polished and slightly less bouncy dance-oriented than \\"Tourist History\\", but I find \\"Beacon\\" to be a very enjoyable album. I saw Two Door Cinema Club in concert last year at Lollapaolooza, when they were already writing songs for the new album. Besides playing much (if not most) of \\"Tourist History\\", they tried out several of those new tracks, but one of those (\\"Someday\\") made in on the new album. Great live set overall! If you have a chance to see these guys live, do not miss them. Meanwhile, \\"Beacon\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!to see these guys live, do not miss them. Meanwhile, \\"Beacon\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B009AMAKJU|4.0|\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" (2012 release; 102 min.) brings the bittersweet tale of Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), an incoming freshman at high school, trying to rebound from \\"time spent in the hospital\\" (which is explained later in the movie). He feels like a fish out of water and just trying to keep his head down. Then, strangely and almost miraculously, he finds friendship with several HS seniors who take him under their wings. Life gets better from there, and eventually he hooks up with one of these HS girls, Mary Elizabeth (played by Mae Whitman), even though his true love is Sam (played by Emmat Watson). I won't spoil more of the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several comments: (1) it takes a leap of faith to understand and accept that HS seniors decide to befriend a HS freshman, for no apparent reason. Do you recall this happening in your life? (2) The early part of the movie is riddled with cliches (the secret gay HS football QB--gasp!, for one). (3) All of the 'in-crowd' are music-nerds to no end (\\"My favorite band is The Smiths\\"; \\"Nick Drake? nice!\\") yet none of them recognize the David Bowie monster-hit \\"Heroes\\" in a pivotal early scene, c'mon! (4) Emma \\"Harry Potter\\" Watson, whom I had never seen before as I have not seen the Harry Potter movies, brings a fantastic performance that just oozes charm all the way. (Paul Rudd also brings an very nice understated preformance in a supporting role as the English teacher.)<br /><br />If some of my comments sound too critical, let me tell you that the last 45 min. of the movie just blew me away in the best of ways. The movie then turns much more introvertal, and it simply resonated with me. At one point towards the end Charlie comments about what is hitting him right then and there, and how \\"someday we'll be a mom or dad\\" and to enjoy the moment got what it is. So true! I recognized myself in that, being a dad now of grown-up kids. A final note: Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the 1999 book, does a great job writing and directing (his debut) this movie. In all, \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!y, who wrote the 1999 book, does a great job writing and directing (his debut) this movie.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|This started off slowly - but got a bit better as it went along.  I think it was \\"slowed\\" down by the few characters in it and the few places that it took place in.  Not the best Jack Reacher story by far.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Nothing was given away in the book, that the current administration didn't already reveal. He did a great job of making it a good read while staying with the main object. Maybe the current administration could take a lesson on how to tell a story without giving away national assets; that should not have been named.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have used the sharpener several time on different knives and it is very good.  I would recommend this product.
0307592731|1.0|This book is full of things that made me wonder if the author has any morals or any ability to do anything but complain. She cheats on her husband, uses drugs, carries condoms in her pack to be ready to have sex with unknown men on the trail, just to mention a few of her immoral actions. I stopped reading in disgust. I heard her on a radio show say she encountered someone with a dog and that the dog's feet were all torn up. In a whining voice (is there any other kind for this woman?) she said she didn't think dogs should be on long hikes. Right there I knew this woman had trouble telling - how shall I say this - she has trouble telling the truth. As a long distance hiker, I can tell you dog feet do not get torn up on long hikes. Hundreds of dogs have completed the entire Appalachian Trail and Pacific Crest Trail without getting their feet torn up. This book went to the dump.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Highly recommend this book. excellent writing. Very good character development.The ending is unbelievable.I have read one of the author's other books, and just as well written.  Can't wait for the movie!

B00136JOF2|4.0|Daydream is a fantastic Mariah Carey album to listen to.  Although, my first favorite is her namesake, this album still show off her great vocal range and emotion in her songs.  I would definitely recommend this album.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This is another outstanding presentation of a character that continues to evolve. As Jack Reacher ages, he has become more complex but just as tough. Soon he will be the toughest guy in the retirement home. Good story with nice twists.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like this because there are so many different combinations of sounds that can be created and it has the individual tones that are defined for different uses that can be combined with your favorite \\"noise\\" combinations...tones for concentration, meditation, sleep, dreaming etc.  Its really pretty nifty.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|From Ken Follett I would expect nothing less than an outstanding novel... exacting in facts and history, compelling in it's aatraction, and alluring in it's presentation.<br />In the beginning,it caused me to remember stories told by my father, who was there before the first world war, served in the AEF during that war and knew the history  first hand. I remember when Hilter came to power and saw the beginning of WW2.<br />Saw the Pacific, Japan, and North China  on a troop ship.<br />It brings back memories and dreams incomplete.

B001NHNG64|5.0|This is my 2nd Lee Childs/Jack Reacher book and I plan on reading all of them. I am a big fan of the Op-Center and Splinter cell books by another author but having read all of them I was searching for another character, Jack Reacher is him. Real action, well written and always full of surprises. John Corey and Jack are two interesting men who keep me on the edge of my seat. Bravo to all the mystery/action writers you are why they made Kindles!!!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read many of Stephen King's books and never been disappointed. I delayed purchasing this one because the title did not sound interesting. How wrong I was. 11/22/63 is not about monsters or anything even close--it's a love story--a very strange love story like none you have ever imagined. It's about taking a step (or two) backwards in time to change the course of history. What are the prices to be paid for doing such a thing? Would YOU attempt to change history if you had the chance?
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This is a good sturdy case for the Kindle HD 7\\".  The elastic band holding it closed is not the best arrangement.  I like a snap like I had for my Kindle 3.  Also the one corner has a tendency to come away from the kindle.  It is not bulky which makes handling the kindle easy and it is soft inside so when you fold it back it feels nice on your hands.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so I had heard about pinterest for a while before I actually joined. I was looking for a new app for my kindle fire and wow! how did I manage with out it. works great. some times does have an issue with not loading to where you have to force close it and then reload it and then it works fine. all in all fantastic app and unlocks a world of ideas!
B00943SP0G|4.0|Very funny movie. Another good Depp/Burton combo. I laughed throughout the whole movie at Depps character and had to watch it over again the next evening. Very entertaining!
B0048KXRR6|3.0|The first version was a total surprise with all new surprises, but this, while having a good assortment of characters and good acting, was not as surprising.
1594132054|5.0|The production, distribution, and consumption of the foods we eat have profound effects on our bodies, our environment, and our nation. This book contains something for everyone. You may be fascinated by biology, ecology, economics, agriculture, politics, or sociology. You may just be confused about all the hype for different kinds of foods constantly bombarding you. There are many reasons to read \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma.\\"<br /><br />Since I am usually bored stiff by economics, I recognized Pollan as a profoundly readable author when, in the first chapter, he managed to make the economics of corn production interesting to me. I was absolutely fascinated by the chapter on grass farming, and the debate centering on organics empowered me as a consumer.<br /><br />The book is extensively researched and referenced and, although Pollan does have an unabashed agenda, he does portray different points of view. (You actually feel sorry for Corn Belt farmers, even as you abhor factory farming practices). Educators in various areas - as I mentioned, economics, biology, agriculture, or sociology - may want to make individual chapters required reading. Warning: Pollan can be flowery and long-winded, and make many apparent digressions from the point before winding up where he wants to go. This style appeals to me, but younger readers can find the ratio of effort to return prohibitive.<br /><br />I bought \\"In Defense of Food\\" based on my liking for this book, and found that I didn't get much out of it that wasn't stated or implied in, \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma.\\" However, I am still planning to explore more of Pollan's work.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am enjoying this book just as much as the other two in the series.  I admit once I start reading I can't seem to stop and I need to know what happened.
B008IZ6OAE|3.0|Everything the more long winded reviews of this season have been saying is true!  There are more holes in season 6 than a good Swiss cheese.  The only thing I can say is if you have watched the series from the beginning be patient. Having watched the entire of season 6, it's still worth the ride, even though some breaks with common sense combined with very flawed character development are practically intolerable. I still hold high hopes they are going to reward us with a more worthy story line in season seven.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|its a good game but would be a lot better if the energy didn't run out so fast and built back up so slow
B0091XRL86|4.0|this was great cartoon.  My kids enjoyed and there was nothing I needed to explain or worry about it.  Great way to kill a few hours on a raining afternoon or long car ride.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|If you are a fan of the Jack Reacher books, this one will not disappoint. Always the best in Reacher stories, always told to keep you turning pages, even though you know our hero will win out in the end. A must read to keep up with Jack as he travels the United States in search of peace and quiet, but only finds people who are in need of his help. And he never refuses to help and never lets you down.<br /> I am waiting for the next one.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Excellent yarn including:<br />A primer on history covering 100 years<br />Suspense in a humorous sense<br />Swedish dry humor at it's best<br />A page turner<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book

B008673ZAQ|4.0|SPOILER ALERT:  This review contains spoilers!<br /><br />I completed reading Reflected in You a few days ago, it has literally taken me three days to wrap my head around my feelings about this book.  At first I was disappointed and angry; I even resorted to texting a girlfriend at three in the morning to vent my dissatisfaction.<br /><br />I thought the novel started out well, lots of angst and heat between Gideon and Eva both damaged and trying to make things work despite their individual but equal plethora of issues.  I found the redemption of Cary to be most welcome and in the end the saving grace comically for the book.  Seriously, he has some of the best lines in the entire book.  My favorite Cary line in RIY:  \\"Deductive reasoning, baby girl.  When I went to sleep, you looked irritated.  When I woke up, you looked like you'd just smoked a fat joint.\\"<br /><br />Where things went wonky for me is when we were introduced to Eva's ex-boyfriend/worst mistake Brett.  We learn about their immature and unhealthy relationship only to discover that he (Brett the rock star) has lingering feelings for Eva.  We discover this while Eva and Gideon attend their show during which they are dry humping in the crowd.  When the band's song Golden plays the lyrics shock Eva especially when her name is said repeatedly in the song, Gideon even comments, \\"That song, makes me think of you.\\"  Really?  So after the dry humping and finger banging by Gideon at Brett's show Eva escapes to the limo to avoid seeing Brett only to end up kissing him.  WHAT?!?!  Of course Gideon witnesses this, quickly engages in fisticuffs with Brett and then \\"punishes\\" her in the limo during a ten hour drive to the Outer Banks.  I was initially disturbed by Gideon's brand of punishment, I found it demeaning and really out of character for him.<br /><br />When they return to the City all hell has broken loose.  Cary has been attacked, her father visits, she discovers that her mother and father still are in love with each other, and Nathan Barker her rapist step brother has returned and has been found dead!  Gideon backs away from Eva leaving her full of doubt until she starts picking apart the pieces of Gideon's past.  Drama galore!<br /><br />The book ends with Eva's assertion that Gideon has killed Nathan for her.  Gideon Cross a murderer?  That's not hot...that is psychotic, right?<br /><br />So when I shut down my Kindle at 4:25am I was initially incredibly disappointed.  After several hours of sleep and hours in the real world I came to the realization that...this is a book.  Its sole purpose is to entertain and tantalize the reader.  I adore Sylvia Day as an author and I think my initial response didn't take into consideration that she is challenging her reader.  Reflected In You is the middle piece and by design should set up loads of drama and perhaps even disappointment so we have something to look forward to in the final chapter.<br /><br />After several days of marinating on my feelings I have to give this four out five stars.  The story is compelling, dramatic, and yes very sexy.  I look forward to what Ms. Day has in store for Gideon and Eva.
B0046B1KHG|4.0|They love the minions! Very funny but a bit on the violent side so make sure you as a parent is there to explain that some actions are not nice and not acceptable.

B005ZMUXDC|5.0|I have 2 boys and yet they love the story probably due to the action packed sequence of the movie! Very funny, not so heavy on violence and hurting people, so as a parent overall rating is 5 stars!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Time well spent it was, marching along with the narrative in this harrowing story of the courageous folks who fight in the shadows.  Despite the controversy and anger by members of the special forces community and U.S. Navy, this story was worth being told.  If anything, one will come to appreciate the dedication and fortitude of the men who choose this most difficult path.  Partly historical about SEAL team 6, the training regiments, the elite relationships, and partly a story about clandestine operations, No Easy Day shines as a first person account of spec ops war.  The remarkable build up to the final confrontation with Osama Bin Laden is telling, and there is a philosophical enlightenment about the folks who drive others to commit acts of terror.  If you enjoyed Marcus Lutrell's \\"The Lone Survivor\\", this is a must.  4.5 stars.

B003IWRE3I|3.0|I was maybe expecting a bit more action or more interaction between<br />groups of wandering Americans in the same mess.

B002SRQ214|5.0|There are very few good reviews about AMD processors on Amazon.  I know this isn't Newegg, but it would still be nice to see comparable reviews for more techy people.<br /><br />I upgraded from a Phenom II x3 to this x4.  This processor is no i7, but it will increased my boot time by about 8 second (that's a lot in just a processor upgrade).  My computer still only says it has 2 cores, but I think that's a win7 issue.<br /><br />For budget computers that still scream, I would always recommend AMD processors.  They are only slightly slower with a 1/10th of the price, leaving you money to get a better tower or even a good heat sink.<br /><br />I will definitely buy another AMD again.  I've had 4 so far and will never shell out the cash for intel until they lower their prices.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|Warrior of the Light is a wonderful book to read with clear and easy to comprehend messages. Simple truths yet profound insights - if I were to sum it up in one sentence.<br />The beauty of the book lies in the fact that it addresses the various situations we face in life at an inner level - no matter which external path of life we may be on - and reveals insights that inspire us to never give up hope and keep courage so that we can fulfill our highest purpose. If self-discovery is your life mission then this book is especially for you, all you warriors of the light!

B00005A3KS|5.0|If you liked the character Patrick Swayze played in Road House, you will love him in Point Break.  Patrick Swayze is the coolest guy and a real badass in this movie.  The surfing scenes in this movie are shot beautifully, as are all the scenes.  Keanu Reeves gives a solid performance. Some people loved this movie so much that it has inspired many of them to learn how to surf.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After being told by numerous people to read this book...I did. I would recommend others to read it as well.
B00000255O|5.0|I consider Herbie Hancock's 70's output spotless up until this album. It's part of a spotless jazz funk trilogy which began with \\"Head Hunters\\" in 1973, when Herbie shifted his ethereal Miles-jazz-electronic sound to something more funky. Released in 1975, \\"Man-Child\\" is every bit as brilliant as \\"Head Hunters\\" or \\"Thrust\\".<br /><br />Opener \\"Hang Up Your Hang Ups\\" sets the mood and catches your attention right away, full of intricate passages and a lot of interplay. And the album just keeps getting better whether it's a mellower trip - \\"Sun Touch\\" and \\"Bubbles\\"; or a funkier ride - \\"The Trailor\\", \\"Steppin' In It\\" and \\"Heartbeat\\".<br /><br />It's an absolute triumph and a big shame Columbia/Sony haven't yet released a proper remastered version of this masterpiece. It's Herbie Hancock surrounded by great musicians and at his 70's best. Essential.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderful group of English actors in a very good film. The big treat is having Judy Dench And Maggie Smith together. A major delight

B0083GR6Y6|1.0|This movie tries to immerse you in struggles with nature and and the internal struggles of the characters.<br />It fails.  What's left is an action movie with no story, no flow, and no closure.

B007THA4FI|5.0|First off, JK Rowling is one of the best if not the best writers of prose I have ever read. Her prose is like poetry: no wonder that the uneducated, unpolished, sleepwalker doesn't like it.<br /><br />I knew it years ago when I first read the first few paragraphs of the Harry Potter books, the way Privet Drive was right in front of you through her words: I knew she was a master of taking you there...<br /><br />She doesn't talk about stuff. She doesn't narrate. She holds your hand, sometimes tight, so you can't run away (Thank you for that) and sometimes lightly, just to assure you you are still with her. That you are still walking with her, looking through her loving eyes (I can't believe I am saying that!) seeing inner and outer filth, greed, inauthenticity, anger, pretense, and learn, as she must have, to take it all in, and not refuse it out of hand, but hold it in your eyes long enough for self-recognition to hit.<br /><br />This ability, missing from most people, is the ticket to a great life. And you have never had a better teacher.<br /><br />The story is rich, characters are varied, detailed, three-dimensional, complete, and after all the bad stuff, to my surprise, likeable... Now, that is tour de force.<br /><br />I'll re-read this book. I loved it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just as good as the first two. A very quick read that continues to captures and keeps your interest. I thoroughly enjoyed and highly recommend this series!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read Gone Girl and wanted to read more Gillian Flynn.  This one is even better.  Great characters that were well developed and not too predictable.
B005TVYVI2|4.0|No complaints about what it does, great for keeping rhythm in strokes while swimming. Problem was it stopped working just under 3 months after bought, luckily FINIS has a 90 day return warranty on the product, after a few emails via their support site the item was replaced with a brand new one and we will see how long this one lasts!
B0071T4BVC|4.0|Love Paul.  Great music.  Only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating is his voice is thin....but after 50+ years, it's expected.  Still artistically beautiful.  Wonderful arrangements and many noteworthy and quality musicians.  Perfect music for a quiet evening.
B0015F1VY8|3.0|Shekhar Kapur did a wonderful job conceiving and directing his film, \\"Elizabeth\\" - which I think is a very fine piece of work.  This follow up, Elizabeth: the Golden Age, does not meet that level of quality in either ideation or direction.  While I think Cate Blanchett did a wonderful job in both movies, the second film had a more 2-dimensional set of characters.  This is especially evident with the representation of the Spanish Catholic characters - most especially Spain's King, who is about as stock a villain as I can imagine -- I half expected him to swirl his mustache.  As someone who spent years in Renaissance and Reformation Studies, I am no fan of the Spanish Empire of that time period.  But the complexities and nuance of Spain's hostilities toward England during this time period, and toward Elizabeth in particular, are so rich and interesting, that a bit more layering of those details would have infinitely enriched the film.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app! It's so relaxing...like going to a spa! I work night shift &amp; I often have trouble falling or staying asleep at night, so this app is just what I was looking for!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albon has the ability to focus on a part of each of  our lives, the aging role model, the homeless or those we will meet in heaven. Each of his books bringing us to a much deeper understanding of our purpose in life.  This one adds  to the hidden wisdom this author shares with his readers. The Time Keeper motivated me to exam my life.  Mitch Albon's characters quickly engaged me in an emotional yet beautiful magical metaphorical story .  If you are feeling you need something to read to assure you are still able to feel emotion, this book is for you. My only negative remark is, I wishes his books were longer. Reading them is like time with a good friend you don't see often and the time you have together passes by to quickly.  Ron
B004LSJCJM|5.0|Some things never change...I say that in a good way. I am referring to the quality of this production as well as the superb musicianship as always present in every JB offering.<br /><br />Another thing that you can count on to never change is that Joe will always be involved in some kind of a collaboration in one shape or form. On this CD, John Hiatt, Glenn Hughes and Vince Gill help Joe kick it up a notch.<br /><br />His regulars, Carmine Rojas on bass and Rick Melick on keyboards plus Tal Bergman(new drummer) on drums round off another exceptional performance.<br /><br />This CD is Joe's 10th release in as many years. Joe Bonamassa continues to pioneer a bold new frontier in the blues and is no longer considered the new kid on the block but a wily veteran. At 34 years of age the sky is the limit and Joe will keep on soaring higher and higher with every performance.<br /><br />Joe has a signature sound where his vocals are concerned, reaching new heights that parallel his musicianship. His boundless energy and commitment will keep him front and center in the industry. Joe Bonamassa is still considered young in the world of blues but has already created a legacy of work to be proud of and admired by fellow musicians and fans alike.

B006PTZNSY|5.0|This is another Nicki Minaj masterpiece. Waiting for a video collection! She's definitely a trailblazer, and, makes good use of the influences of the artists who've come before her. I think she'll be the first female in hip-hop/rap to be a true mogulllllll![[ASIN:B006PTZNSY Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded]]
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I am completely addicted to this series.  If I could watch Season 5 all at once I would. The characters are interesting and I love the plot.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love the site. so many great ideas! I love the do it yourself and easy tips. fabulous recipes as well.
B005KELW26|5.0|I've had this about a month and a half, so far I'm a pleased. I thought for the price it wasn't going to do much for my kindle......I was wrong! This keeps my kindle very secure and protected from any scratches. The magnetic flap keeps it closed, and the cover is not too thick or thin.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a nice change up from the same old love stories. The main character was not easily relatable, but still was a good book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an invaluable resource for digital Bible study. I use it to bookmark verses so I don't have to write in my bible and I love having access to different Bible versions all from one app.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|This game is great. It has many difficulty levels for each puzzle type and keeps track of your best time for each type.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I could not put this book down!<br /><br />When I first started reading Cloud Atlas, the old English dialogue made it slow going.  But two chapters in, I was hooked.  The way Mitchell weaves the centuries, people and events together is genius.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas brilliantly shows how our attitudes about life have affected the world around us.  May it teach us a lesson before it is too late!<br /><br />Can't wait to see the movie, but am sceptical that it can keep up with the book.
B005F72IFS|4.0|Brilliant as always. Beautiful language and a compelling story.  Have read it in my teens, 20's 30's 40's 50's and 60's and continue to be thrilled by the eloquence of the writing
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Like many people I grew up watching 21 Jump St. So when I heard about this I simply rolled my eyes and forgot about it.<br />Then I saw it on Netflix and read the reviews and figured I'd give it a shot.<br />I'm glad I did.<br />It has a rather simple story but Tatum, Cube and Jonah are absolutely hilarious.<br />I never thought I'd see that side to Tatum. He was awesome in this movie.<br />I liked it so much I'll buy the Blu Ray.<br />The movie was very dirty language wise and that may or may not be a turn off for some viewers. It didn't bother me one bit.<br />Loved it.<br />Recommended.
B006PHD0RW|3.0|This is a great game and it works perfect on my HTC Inspire, but when I downloaded it on my Tablet it force closes all the time.  I paid for this game and it won't work on my tablet, very dissappointed!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is one Awesome game! Both Solo and Co-op play is flawless. I enjoy it and it's easy enough for my young boys too.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Truly a gripping story!  Twists and turns you don't see in many books often anymore with an ending that is truly not forseen!
B008CXWX4S|5.0|My daughter would watch it every week and I would make fun of her! Then I watched it with her one night when there was nothing else on, and I loved it!! The acting was so good! It's not just for teens! Kind of reminds me of a younger version of Desperate Housewives.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a very good product.  It works  great when needing to pass time when traveling. Sometimes it can be difficult to move the cards.  It may take 2-3 tries but this is a very small problem.  I recommend this game.
B006VREN86|5.0|Great story, great characters. Amazing setting of the boardwalk, even thought its filmed in Brooklyn, NY.  Overall a great series. Highly recommended.
B0098VXE50|5.0|This movie is well made with good story and lots of action.  It is good to see Snow White accept a large responsibility.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|the seventh is annabeth in the end of the story percy and annabeth dall into the pit of tartarus. yeah i am ruining itfor you. this book is great.
B0033QC0WE|5.0|Beethoven never sounded so good to me!  Wonderful recording.  Love the individual sounds of the instruments, the pace, the style.  I'll be adding more to my collection.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is just like playing at the arcade i havent had this much fun playing a game in awhile think youll really get a kick out of this game
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I am a huge fan of the series and have read them all so far. some even more than once. this one takes a long time to build suspense. the bad guys are not as bad as others and the whole plot is weak. if you are a fan of the series still go ahead and read. it is not bad but I have read the Reacher best ones and this one falls short
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I actually saw the movie before I read this book. I was enchanted by the, well, how do I put it, amazingness of the film. My little sister, who is only seven, watched it with me. She was terrified, especially when Glimmer gets stung by all those tracker-jackers. We both adored Katniss though, because she is brave, loyal, a great friend, and as my sister said &#34;very pretty!&#34;.<br /><br />I read the book, and it was just as good as the film. I won't say much though, because I do not want to spoil it, but if you read it, I have one thing to say. May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favour.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Product: 5 stars<br />Comes with the digital soundtrack, no DRM. The 3D is this movie is awesome, and the extra DVD/Bluray is really convenient. The digital copy of the movie is meh, though. It's not even 720p quality. Overall, still 5 stars, though, because i bought this for the movie in 3D. Everything else is just bonus.<br /><br />Amazon: -1 star<br />One other thing, though: I pre-ordered this when it listed for $24.99. If you read Amazon's pre-order policy, it clearly states that you receive the benefit of any price drops.  (see: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_468502_guarantee?nodeId=468502#guarantee) When the price dropped down to $19 on the release day, I didn't get the lower price until I complained to amazon. Fine. But then the customer service rep denies that this is their policy, but he'll \\"make an exception.\\" Lo and behold, this is the policy:<br /><br /> Whenever you pre-order a book, CD, video, DVD, video game, or software item, the price we charge when we ship it to you will be the lowest price offered by Amazon.com between the time you place your order and the end of the day on the release date. The order summary in Your Account will reflect the lowest price within 24 hours of the price change.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|im confused is there going to be another book? at the end of book three i was very confused with the ending. is there going to be another book or not
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I am one of those people who is always very critical of a movie once I have read the book.  This attempt to bring a book to life was no different.  I think they did a pretty good job but I cannot give it 5 stars.  They squeezed an awful lot into the movie and that is what it felt like.  I honestly cannot see how someone could follow the movie if they had not read the book.  Jennifer Lawrence was very good but it is hard to top her performance in Winter's Bone.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The personal story of Bruce Wayne that Nolan and company told in the Dark Knight Trilogy is fantastic. Taking some of the most epic story lines from the comics and integrating them into these movies was fantastic. The Dark Knight Rises brings everything to an end in one of the most satisfying ways. The most obvious influences on the film are Knightfall, No Man's Land and The Dark Knight Returns, with several other little nods to fans.<br /><br />Fantastic story, fantastic acting, fantastic movie. One of the most thrilling theater experiences I've ever been a part of.
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|When I watched the first episode of this show, I did not know what to think.  I was mesmerized and could not stop watching it but in the back of my head I was thinking something was not right.  Hard to explain.  I did not miss an episode all season and was waiting impatiently for it to come out on video.<br /><br />There are not that many one hour shows that can keep my attention all the way to the end.  In fact, it seemed like each episode came to an end way too fast.  It did not feel like the hour was up.  I think I could have stayed glued to two hour episodes.<br /><br />I am amazed at how one of the cast members is left out of the promotions for this show.  Evan Peters was just so creepy.  He was a major player in the show and almost as scary as his mother.  Kick Ass was one of my favorite movies from a couple years ago and I thought he did a fantastic job in that movie too.<br /><br />I am looking forward to the new season.
B0095R64AO|4.0|If you have a girl crush on Emily blunt, as I do, then you can't not enjoy this movie. I laughed through most of it.

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm a big Lee Child fan and just love Jack Reacher.  In this latest novel, as usual he's up to his neck in trouble. He fell into it minding his own business, trying to \\"look\\" friendly (he's anything but) and hitching a ride. He's picked up by 2 men and a woman.  Things, of course are not as they seem.  He catches on that much is amiss and the wildness begins. Ordered this through Amazon for my Kindle and it was waiting for me on the day of release.
B0014TEWNW|5.0|Oh my gosh, this show is SO ADDICTIVE!  I watched all 5 seasons back to back in a very short period of time.  5-stars all around - AWESOME show!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like pinterest, but prefer not to have to open it a few times before I get to actually look at pins.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game. some are easy some are super hard. great for killing time.  some of the games are  very repetitive and almost not challengeing.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Jack Reacher is one of my faves!  I do have the feeling that he is now churning out so much money for author that books are written in a big rush!  The earlier ones were more exciting and better written!  But...that being said, I'm still a fan.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I not only found this book to be fascinating, I also have read all of this authors books and would give them the same review.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Snappy fast paced without being silly Reacher at his best   some unexpected twists and turns made this a very good read
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm always a bit nervous when it comes to a follow up book to one that I really enjoyed. Reflected in You knocked my socks off. I adored Bared to You but have to say I liked this one as much if not more then the 1st. Only thing that bothered me at first was although I understand the great pull of sexual tension between Eva & Gideon I didn't like how it made Eva look so weak. The scene after the concert in the limo almost made me sick. It became more like a drug addict whore trying to do anything for her next \\"fix\\". It weakened her a bit in my eyes. At that point I would of liked to seen more insight as to why she did what she did and not just a way to get back at him. Maybe a bit of doubt of their relationship faced with Brett appearing and her obvious attraction she still felt for him. I enjoyed the possible love triangle and wished there could of been more involving of Brett. With the hopes it would help her in her journey of actually finding herself and not getting lost.. wrapped up.. with everything concerning Gideon. It was great being able to see scattered inside thoughts of Gideon. I look forward to the next book!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan & I've honestly never found anything he's written or even been a part of that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. Having said that, I consider this the best adult novel he's written to date. It is a far-reaching story with complicated & interesting characters that I fell in love with and genuinely care about. This story is full of myths and folk-tales and will appeal to people who like that. I felt that it changed the way I look at America and our history as a country and as a people. It does slow down a bit here and there to tell a story or set up something important, this may feel like the story is slowing down or dragging to some people. This is how Neil writes and if you can commit to it, it always pays off in the end! This is a true story of substance. This anniversary edition is nice for the hard-core fans like myself but there was not a lot of extras so if you get the original edition I don't feel like you would miss anything important.<br />Enjoy!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was a bit of a chore for me to read. To me it is a sad story about sad people in a dreary place. Tweek it a little and you could have a Robert McCammon novel. Some of those drag on, too. Some readers like that kind of stuff. If you are one of them, go for it. Or, perhaps read Bleak House, it costs a lot less.
B00021HBGS|5.0|This toy is a lifesaver! My 3 year old son hates baths, and this toy is just the thing we needed to make bathtime go smoother. Any child who loves vehicles will be sure to love this toy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|&#34;The Mark of Athena&#34; was honestly the best book I've ever read in my entire life. With it's twists and turns, suspense, humor, and drama, the third enstallment in the &#34;Heroes of Olympus&#34; series is the best one yet.  Follow Annabeth, Jason, Piper, Leo, Percy, Hazel, and Frank as they journey to Rome - And follow The Mark of Athena!
B0097S0TM0|5.0|Pink has done it again. The CD is definatley worth getting. I really like the song Blow me a kiss.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It is highly addictive and oddly captivating. It's easy to lose yourself in the fun of it. I'm always sad when I run out of coins.
0316228532|5.0|I kind of think maybe she should have written this book under a (different) pen name. That way there wouldn't be so many whiners complaining about how \\"I loved Harry Potter but this was just not my style\\" and gave the book 1 star. It's unfortunate when an author can't write in a different style without the masses exclaiming she should have just left it at Harry Potter. If you can't stretch beyond your tiny box of what type of books you read, or you can't overlook that the \\"Queen of Harry Potter\\" wrote this novel, or you don't like contemporary novels, or you don't like anything that makes you uncomfortable-with-ugly-topics, perhaps you should save your trouble and not buy the book and then leave a horrible, undeserving review.<br /><br />That said, this is almost the complete opposite of what she wrote in Harry Potter - it was dark, it had some (very) adult and mature themes, and it was real life. And I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />I read a lot - both fiction and non-fiction - and I feel that it's a rare quality in a book when I'm so into what's going on in the book that I can't put it down. Her characters, while maybe to some were a bit \\"cliche\\", were real people and I could connect with their heartbreak and sadness and the rest of their emotions. I love finishing a book only to wonder \\"What's beyond the tip of the iceberg?\\". I felt that these characters were well plotted out before she even started the book and it shows - there's more depth and background included than in a lot of surface-only stories. To me, it felt like an actual town and it's inhabitants and Jo had just played anthropologist for the novel.<br /><br />Her writing pulls the story along, it weaves through the lives of these characters and, had a lesser author tried to tell the same story, it wouldn't have been interesting. But she has a way with words that's amazing and much more polished now than when she wrote the first HP book. And that's what a great author does, she tells a story in such a way that it hooks you.<br /><br />But, I don't read much \\"contemporary\\" fiction as most of it bores me - this engaged me though, from the first chapter - there was something about the dust cover description. Perhaps I'm obsessed with the British though and maybe that means I'm a bit biased. I love reading about different cultures, and people who are different from me - and I love reading about how people in different countries handle life and love and situations that could happen anywhere; but how THEY handle it is (sometimes a lot and sometimes just a bit) different from what I would do. And that fascinates me and makes me think - so perhaps this book isn't for everyone - open mind required.<br /><br />It reminded me of another book about life in a small British town - another wonderful story if you, like me, couldn't get enough of the picture Ms. Rowling painted  - [[ASIN:0812981227 Major Pettigrew's Last Stand: A Novel]].a way that it hooks you.<br /><br />But, I don't read much \\"contemporary\\" fiction as most of it bores me - this engaged me though, from the first chapter - there was something about the dust cover description.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book happened to be recommended to me by 4 people from completely separate areas of my life. Paulo Coehlo is an extremely talented and gifted story teller. This book happened to cross my path at very important cross-roads in my own life's journey. Inspiring in the most imaginable ways. Paulo has a unique way of bonding with a reader through this story. It is now one of my all time favorite stories and I am currently reading it to my 11 year old son!
B0026OR1UK|5.0|As a professional trainer and coach for 30 plus years, this book has rocked my world - shattering long held beliefs about how to train new skills.<br /><br />If you are a parent, teacher, professor, trainer, or coach, you need this book.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.
0525953728|3.0|There was some background about the extensive training to become a Navy Seal. Most Americans know these are impressive individuals who deserve our respect and thanks. There was also some interesting information about the mission itself. And there were some details that I had not heard from the media about Bin Laden's death. However, the material would have made a good magazine article. It seems a real stretch to have made it into a book.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I read all of the books in this genre. This one is good but not the best. Worth reading for getting the inside story on the UBL raid. Not as compelling as FEARLESS or LONE SURVIVOR. Recommended.
B006UKFFE0|1.0|This book has totally totally rigged reviews! If this book use this way to gain top reviews.<br /><br />I have not read this book, but according to these rigged reviews, I will never read.
0525953728|5.0|It comes across as honest, unembellished and forthright, unlike the Obama administration's self-agrandizing account of the operation that got Bin Laden. A must-read from one of the men who put his life on the line for others' safety...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The quality of this game is really good and I got addicted to the game after the first level.I really recommend this game if like addicting games.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As I was looking for a new book to read I came across this one. I purchased the omnibus series of five and started reading. This series has everything in it, I really could'nt put my Kindle down, I needed to see what was coming next and there was always something. Best I've read in a while and I just purchased book 6 and I'm already looking at this author's other books. Great read.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Really enjoyed Defending Jacob - The crime scene was very good - very believable -Mr.Landay always keeps the reader  guessing as he also did in Mission Flats .
B008RYN44U|1.0|I can't be the only person who noticed that this isn't a No Doubt album.  This is a Gwen Stefani album with No Doubt as her backing band.  If you like Gwen Stefani's solo stuff, then you will like this album.  If, like me, you don't like her solo stuff, then you will not like this album.  I have a feeling that we will never hear a new true No Doubt album, since Gwen has (just as the video for Don't Speak predicted) become the \\"real\\" star.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Things I could have done instead of waiting for my book to (possibly) open to the page I was reading when it last crashed: 1. Walk to the library. Not the one near my home in the USA-the one I assume exists somewhere South of the Panama Canal but north of Antarctica. Like that big river I remember reading about in a book made of paper (I think the name rhymes with &quot;Ramazon&quot;. 2. Learned to read, write and fluently converse in whatever language/dialect is used in that hypothetical southernmost library place. 3. Compose, edit, rewrite, edit, print, copy, publish and negatively review my autobiography tentatively titled &quot;Still waiting for Kindle to Load &quot;4. Write this review.....  In summary this app is huge slow, crashes, and is great  at consuming battery power. I give it 2 stars and award it with a grade of E for effort.
B00992CF6W|4.0|overall the game is great, but I cant open chests,furnaces, etc... in creative, so if there is an update there, and if we can make armor, it would be the best.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Pretty good but I expected more action early on.  One thing was clear.Tom C. will never be a believable Reacher.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book!  Lots of twists and turns with several surprises along the way!  This book also gives readers a glimpse of issues facing teens today. As a parent i could really feel the pain of Jacobs parents. This was one iof those books I couldn't  wait to get to the end to see what happens but hated to finish it because it was so good!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|hey guys this game is the best game that I have ever played and it is the best game I have
0765322889|5.0|This book in MY OPINION is a really well written, with good character development and back story.  The author didn't seem to draw out the story and I didn't notice any inconsistencies during my first read through.<br /><br />If you are a fan of fantasy novels I would recommend at least giving this book a try before diving into the rest of the series (I have the second book on order!).<br /><br />That said, the one major thing I found confusing was remembering the different species/gods in the novel.  There are quite a few and as they are referenced and appear in the novel it can be difficult to keep track of who is who.  I'm really glad the author included a glossary as this helped with some of the confusion early on.<br /><br />TL;DR  Really good book, I would recommend it to any fantasy reader.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I just love this album. I have listened to it so many times, and it never gets old. The lyrics are good, while being abstract. Imagine Dragons will be a really successful band in the future.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its a great time waster it doesn't exactly have a point but its pretty fun you would want this if u get bored
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not much of a reader, but this book kept my interest!  A book that put into perspective of the training involved, personal sacrifices, and giving credit were it belongs.....what a great tribute to all involved and to those of the fallen SEALS.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Great. Worth the money and it was easy to order. I even bought two so I could give one as a gift.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Another wonderful book from Mr. Follett. I was entranced from the first page to the last. Hoping the third installment will be out next year. I also learned some things about  WW II I had not previously know and his story gave me insight into the emotions of the time.
B0089ZEEYG|2.0|Game doesnt save at thr end of a level orherwise it was kinda fun but having to play tge same level over and over if interrupted gets old
B009CPJHY4|1.0|I can only think that the prominent actors and actresses who signed up for this film now regret it. Hackneyed and cliched, it says nothing insightful about real life or the experience of aging. Well, you don't just recover from hip replacement without a lot of rehab and risk of reinjuring yourself. And there is a reason the elderly live in old age homes. They protect them from the risk of falls, crime and dementia, real risks that never would show up in a movie like this, where characters only die painlessly after they have fulfilled their lifelong desires, and no one is infirm. Two hours of this and you'll want all the time back.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|This group is very talented and their covers are wonderful interpretations of popular pop songs. Although the album is short (only six songs) it is definitely worth the money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is awesome! I'm just a civilian, a disabled RN at home full time, so I didn't know all the lingo. Mark Owen couldn't have done a better job. Acronyms were explained, thoughts and rationales were explained thoroughly so I never felt \\"lost\\", therefore I didn't get bored and put it aside for another day. I ESPECIALLY LOVED the maps & diagrams! It made the mission that much more clear because I'm a map/diagram kind of girl. Just earlier this week at Kroger, there was a man standing at an end-cap looking at books, I JUST HAD to tell him how great Mr. Owens' book is!<br />I love our military, I think they're THE TRUE HEROES of AMERICA! Period. Thank you Mr. Owens for writing your book and serving our country. You are a patriot!
B00931JMRE|5.0|Throughout their long history and many albums, ZZ Top is a band that knows exactly who they are and what they want to do together.  La Futura is no Exception.
B004XQO90E|5.0|Source Code is a SciFi thriller that follows Captain Colter Stevens as he attempts to identify a terrorists and stop a second attack through the \\"Source Code\\"; he takes the body of a teacher that was killed in the first attack and has several chances, all 8 minutes long, and limited resources to find the terrorist. I won't go deep into the story because it does have some stunning twists and turns.<br /><br />First, the story is unique and interesting; the whole concept of entering someone's body to relive the last 8 minutes of their life is fascinating (If you play video games, it may remind you of the recent \\"Driver: San Francisco\\".) The story moves at a very fast pace and is thoroughly interesting. It's one of those films that you get lost in and don't bother to check the time. Jake Gyllenhaal gives another brilliant performance, as well as the rest of the cast. The music was also incredible and really stood out to me. The film has some beautiful shots, the explosions are visually stunning. (The Blu-Ray has amazing Picture Quality and Audio Quality.) Aside from the SciFi and Action elements, I felt like some of Colter's actions were really funny, like the restroom scene where he won't stop staring. The ending of the film will leave you with questions and will probably have you anxiously waiting to start it up from the beginning for another viewing.<br /><br />Source Code delivers as a SciFi Thriller. The story is surreal, in a good way, and the ferocious pace keeps you at the edge of your seat. I highly recommend a purchase, especially a purchase of the high quality blu-ray.<br /><br />This film has violence and blood. No sex or nudity.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|When traveling I always turn to Trip Advisor for meal recommendations.  Member reviews are typically spot on.  I've never ben disappointed.  Hotel reviews are also a favorite.  Thanks TA for a great product!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I was really looking forward to this latest Jack Reacher book, unfortunately it was Not worth the wait.  It's slow and plods along to a rather boring conclusion.  Least favorite!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|An interesting book with good detail. Certainly worth a read. I enjoyed the first hand account and the background about SEAL training.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a great game when it works properly very very fun to play I gave it a five star
B009LZDGSI|4.0|I last saw Miller playing the bad guy on DEXTER. He was quite good playing the bad guy and he did it with an american accent.  However, he is really an Englishman and in this series he is using his own voice even though it is set in New York. Watson is a woman doctor instead of a man in this version and Lucy Liu is quite good playing her.<br /><br />I was prepared not to like this because we have a present day Sherlock now being telecast by the BBC which is brilliant.  If we want to see Holmes the way he was written, we just go to the Jeremy Brett Mystery series. However, Miller is very, very good and I must say, the most appealing to women of all these Sherlocks--that he was good enough to be angelina jolie's first real life husband speaks volumes on this issue.  I think it will come down to the writing on whether this makes it or not.  My suggestion is that they increase the focus on his drug rehab treatment, perhaps even sending him to therapy sessions with a psychiatrist.  This could be a gold mine which has been previously unmined.<br /><br />This episode concerns a woman in a coma who seems to be killing people yet it is supposed to be impossible.
0061122416|2.0|I bought this books with some expectations, so I was disappointed.  I should have looked that its listed under, mysticism and self help.  I was looking for a great story. I assumed it was fantasy.  But this is about as simple and shallow as a story gets.  No depth whatsoever to characters. The story is quite simple, know what is your true dream and follow it.  If you do that life will help you along.<br /><br />The story advocates listening to your heart, because it speaks to us, and gives us guidance.  Often when we fail its because we did not listen to our hearts.  To underscore the truthfulness of this, my heart was saying \\"Stop reading! This is Dull!!!\\" but I did not listen and pretty much had to push through this book, suffering all the way.<br /><br />That said it gives a nice message, although unbelievably simple and personally I feel it should be a childrens book.  I figure someone looking for some guidance or inspiration in their lives might get more out of this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok first off its minecraft not that block story sht.<br />now I know so.e of you are whining about lack of redstone buckets lava caves etc,  BUT that's all going to be fixed! in the November 9th update, most redstone items,  buckets,  more lava, caves, armor, enchanting,<br /> brewing, and melon/pumpkin farming + much more, are ALL coming to the pocket edition! now the PE and XBox will be EXACTLY the same!(Xbox will obtain enchanting and brewing on the 8th)<br />so.... fork out the 7$ and get it! its sooooo much better than that block story crap!<br />any minecraft fan, or even if your new to MC, will LOVE this app!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read the book, it didn't take long.  However, it was a bit too \\"ahhhhhhhhh whatever\\" for me. Enlightening for sure.  I am told the next two books following are better but to date I have not read nor purchased them.  I may borrow, I don't know for now.  I certainly won't pay to read them if they are a repeat of #1 even though I did buy IT to see what all the FLAP was about.  Shades of Grey by Jessica James, however, imho... is very very good if you like civil war stories similar to a Gone With The Wind scenario and I will buy her next book; Noble Cause.
B00136JMSQ|5.0|Jeff Beck is an amazing artist and knows how to fuse Rock and Jazz into some very listenable songs. This is my favorite album by him.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book honors the last request of one of our nations Heroes.  It tells his life story, the good, the bad and most of all the inspirational.  Adam Brown overcame some of the most unbelievable obstacles imaginable with grace and dignity to become a member of the countries \\"Ultra Elite\\" tier one military unit - DEVGRU better known as S.E.A.L. Team 6.  His fierce never quit  no matter the obstacles attitude will inspire others to overcome their own demons and setbacks.  The book also introduces the reader to an up close look at a devoted and determined woman, with a determination and unstoppable attitude of her own.  In my eyes they are both heroes, and deserve this countries utmost respect (as do all of our service members who have given the ultimate sacrifice).  Fearless is an understatement when referring to this man, his wife  and his teammates.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game I &lt;3 it. hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi. hi hi
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really enjoyed Riordan's new book. I have been counting the days until the new one came out and it fully fulfilled my expectations. I honestly think that Riordan is my favorite writer. This book was great in so many ways. My favorite part about it is that it amped up the Romance a little bit. I was in tears at the end and am already excited about the next one. I can't wait!
B008XG1X18|5.0|my daughter told me about Pinterest about three weeks ago.I LOVE IT! ! Iam  busy most of the time but any free time I get am on it. I HAVE TO GET MY PINTEREST FIX .!!
B00563M11M|4.0|The thought that Terry Pratchett may not always be around to turn out the fabulous Discworld books mean I treat every new one as a little gem. The policeman-to-noble Sam Vines, the not so benevolent Vettinari and a host of other characters who are just as well formed make the series and this book in particular a real joy. Deciding a species is intelligent may touch a bit close to events in human history, but as usual Pratchett deals with it with humour and style.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is by far my favorite kindle fire game! Beautiful graphics with an engaging story and brainteasing puzzles. Can't wait for the next one!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This movie is excellent.  Movie studios have relied on sequels, prequels, and reboots for the last few years or so, and it was nice to have an original idea.  It has a pretty interesting (and at times confusing) plot with a little something for everyone (romance, action, etc.).  I definitely recommend at least renting it.  I bought it so that I can watch it as regularly as I want; I enjoyed it that much.
1932100660|5.0|The information in this book was ,it seems, the foundation for much of the work done by dr fuhrman,and dr Esselstyn and Dr Cornish.  Dr Esselstyn has done astounding work at the Cleveland clinic showing incredible results working with very diseased individuals. His major finding has been that a plant based diet can reverse the health of very diseased individuals provided they restrict their diets to plant based foods.  Everyone of his patients had a total reversal of their health provided they stayed on a plant based diet. Those that went off the diet had serious health complications soon after their decisions not to continue with their<br />Plant based diets.  Dr Furhman has a web cite that testifies very similar findings as does Dr Esselstyn and dr Cornish!  Dr Fuhrman has a much larger client than any of the other Doctors. He sees about 5000 patients per year and the results are quite<br />Astounding !  Check them out Drfuhrman.com.<br /><br />How can anyone refute the vast number of individuals who all attest to incredible changes to their health?<br />I do not know one person who has gone onto this diet and has not lost considerable weight, felt a lot more energetic,<br />And have seen their cholesterol,blood pressure  and blood sugat make significant progress !<br /><br />MY wife and I have been on this diet for 3 months and have found our health and energy levels to be significantly better.All my family and friends that I have given the program to have likewise found very similar results !<br /><br />Dr fuhrman contends alon with Dr Cambell and Dr Esselton that Heart DISEASE,Diabetes,,Stokes and Cancer can be cured by<br />Going to a Plant based diet!  The only way to refute this statement is for some individual to show someone who has followed this diet for over a year and after that period of time come down with one of these major diseases !  So far I have not seen anyone making that claim !  By the way Dr Fuhrman. Contends it is diet and exercise. Eating is just not enough ! Diet with exercise will give incredible results !
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not put this one down, OMG, more of Cary, more of Gideon, hot, hot, hot. I can't wait for the next book. I read in one day. Now I need more more more.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|The kids enjoyed the singing, and the overall story about killing trees.  They wanted to plant a tree and focus on recycling.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's a great no fantastic app! I love it if only I could sneek it in to math class!!!!!!!!! you should totally get this app!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I usually don't get into this type of book.  I just found the story so interesting that I started to read it anyway.  I have to say, once I began, I couldn't stop.  I absolutely loved it.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another superb Reacher novel.  It was nice to read this one where Reacher didn't get beaten, smashed, clubbed, or nearly killed during the story.  All that mayhem to him in every book has not been necessary.  Once again, though, Lee Child has come through with a winner.  Reacher stories are fun to read, and always exciting to the end.  Keep them coming.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I thought the film had heart and was really funny all at the same time.  A good movie for all ages.  It had a good message in it that would apply in today's world.  I would recommend this to anyone, and would watch it again.
B000XXGMSS|5.0|I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. Very comfortable boot, nice look, durable and excellent price too. That's all that i wanted! Five star product.
B003JVH7XU|5.0|This movie starts off with the returning anti-hero Boyka, \\"the most complete fighter\\". This movie is much better than Undisputed II in that it leaves out all the sentimental garbage that was included in the sequel. Boyka left in a rat whole of a prison to mop the dirty floors and hobble around on is destroyed knee with little care after injuring it against \\"Iceman\\" Chambers is roused by an inter Prison fight competition. He trains through merciless pain to pull off some of the greatest martial arts moves I've seen in this genre of movie. Boyka then moves on to the big leagues of the seedy underground prison fighting league. There is some attempt at a storyline involving another American who would seem to resemble the attitude and physique of \\"Iceman\\" Chambers of the previous two movies. There is good back and forth between the two which ends up being the center of the movie as only one other character is truly developed albeit lightly throughout the storyline. We also receive a different perspective on the mob leader \\"Ga Ga\\" who seems to take on a lighter role in this movie. He was a feared and dangerous mob leader in the previous movie and proves more of a comic relief at times in this episode to some confusion.  Boyka also seems to make a change as he seems to have lost respect in the prison after his loss. He does not have groupies following him around waiting for him to beat them up when he is upset and the lunch room does not fall quiet when he walks in. This time Boyka is a broken man on the return which makes him more likeable, even though he's still retains his B.A. status.<br />Lots of great martial arts moves, decent story line, definitely worth watching.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Couldn't get through this one. Just get married already. I expected much more from this film.  Don't waste your time.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love love love using the pinterest app! I use it everyday for new ideas and recipes. The one and only problem I would give it is that it has a ton of force closes, so I have to get out of it and go back in. Sucks but I do still love the app!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Jack Reacher is becoming an icon in American suspense literature. This Reacher saga is right up there with all of Child's previous Reacher adventures. Child's books are always very good reads. Let's hope the film version does them justice.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I liked this app a lot more when I first downloaded it, before YouVersion started fixing everything that wasn't broken.<br /><br />When I first got the app, using the \\"Catch me up\\" function meant that whether you were ahead or behind (both of which I've been), it would set your \\"where you are in the plan\\" to the day after your last completed reading.  I hadn't used the function in months but as of today I was several days behind, so I asked it to catch me up.  What did it do?  It marked all my unread days as read!  So now I have to scroll back through the days that the app incorrectly marked as read, and check them until I find the day I don't recall recently reading.  That's what the Bible in a year plan is supposed to do for me, remember where I am so I don't have to.  I can find no way to mark a supposedly read day or chapter as unread.<br /><br />There are bugs with chapter display, which should definitely not happen if the version I'm currently reading is downloaded to the phone.  If in the middle of reading my wifi disconnects and reconnects, or my cell signal switches from 4G to 3G in a sketchy signal area, the app all by itself scrolls back up to the top of the chapter, sits there for a few seconds until connection is re-established, then tries to scroll back down to where I was currently reading.  Why does it need to do that?  Very frustrating especially before I knew it would try to scroll back down by itself, because I would swipe to get back to where I was and it would add my swipes to its own scrolling and end up past where I had read.  If I select a chapter from a plan and the version I'm reading is downloaded, no network connection should be required to fetch the chapter, or used while I'm actually reading it.<br /><br />Depending on display settings, the book/chapter header bar can block out the boldface section descriptions but the bar won't disappear until I've scrolled far past the section description.  The display code should be written to alwaysstart the text below any header widgets while they're on the screen.<br /><br />Admittedly this is an enhancement request, but all the plans I'm currently reading should be downloaded in entirety to my phone, because it would amount to at most a few K of data each if efficiently structured.  That way if I am on airplane mode or just have poor signal, I can stay on my plan as long as I have the Bible version I am reading also downloaded for offline.  The next time the app is run while the phone is network-connected, it would sync up the plan changes with the server.  I have no trouble reading a downloaded version while not connected if I pick my own chapter, why can't I do the same with a plan?<br /><br />YouVersion, stop trying to make the app so fancy because you're breaking it in the process (it takes *so* long to start up now), and make the changes that would facilitate the reading of a plan even while disconnected.  Rating it on the current app quality alone and the frustration it causes me while trying to read my Bible from a plan would give you one star from me.  But, the app is about helping people with their reading of God's Word, which is admirable and needed, and it's free, so that's why I gave you a second star.
B000VRH2CQ|5.0|Just buy it, you will be glad you did. Classics Charles Mingus a must have for anyone that likes jazz
0446547573|5.0|I am familiar with Nicholas Sparks books and movies, but have never read one.  I found this one at a cabin I'm vacationing at, and from the moment I picked it up, I was sucked in!  I couldn't wait to get back to it!  I haven't felt that way in a long time about a book!  I think I need to read more lighthearted, breezy reads like this!  I always pressure myself to read \\"tougher\\" reads, but I never seem to finish most of them.  This one really kept my interest, and isn't THAT the joy of reading a good book?  [Spoiler Alert! -->  I was also pleasantly surprised by the paranormal aspect of the story!]  PS  I didn't find this book cheesy or unrealistic at all.
0812993292|5.0|I started this book with little expectations of being moved by it, but I'm happy to say I definitely was.  This book gave me the same kind of feeling that books like \\"The Elegance of the Hedgehog\\" and \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society\\" did.  I'm not going to write the synopsis of the book since that's said already. This book is an easy read but kept me wanting to hurry and get back to it.  I greatly admire Harold and his wife, Maureen.  It's a story about love, and forgiveness, especially self-forgiveness.  I encourage you to read this one, it will touch your heart.
B004X80QNG|4.0|l love this app.  I use the calendar every day.  I want to use it for my contacts as well but everytime I try to add a contact, the app closes.
B008ZVXNX2|5.0|A great album and very inspiring.  Good listening whatever you are doing.  I love the classics and the mood changes this can cause.
B0064MT1QW|5.0|This movie was the most moving I have ever seen.  Why Ralph Fiennes<br />did not win an Oscar for this, I will never know. Every actor in<br />the movie was so well cast, the scenery, photography, and music,
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story is very different and refreshing compared to other suspense mystery novels I've read.  I couldn't put it down, always had to know what came next!  Great read and a new favorite author.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|not that bad a game. you need help from neigbors though in order to build certain  things. if it wasnt for that the game would be better.

B008PNBU30|5.0|It was kind of a different album but in a good way, the way they play with sounds is good.<br /><br />The whole album was very good in my opinion.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|This was recommended for our book club and everyone enjoyed reading it! If you liked Gone Girl then this is a must read for you as well.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is clearly just for horny housewives who don't know what a good book actually is.<br /><br />I just have so many issues with the way it's written that I almost can't stand to read any more. The author puts way too much detail into things that don't need it and not enough detail into the things that do, the amount of times that she uses the word \\"flush\\" and \\"murmur\\" is absolutely outrageous, she's horribly inconsistent in the way that she uses her characters' names and only starts to call Grey by his first name towards the halfway mark in the book. There are also a bunch of flaws in the plot/storyline.<br /><br />First, I find it a bit unbelievable that a girl named Anastasia Steele is some gawky English lit nerd and NOT a porn star. I also find it hard to believe that she's 21, has never been sexually attracted to anyone, has never masturbated, has never even been drunk, and then becomes a sex fiend literally overnight. The fact that she orgasms within a matter of seconds and without much more than just having a nipple tweaked is also quite unrealistic. Then there's the incredibly hot, tragic, talented, philanthropic, self-made business man that she suddenly has the urge to throw herself at. Granted, if Christian Grey was real I would want to throw myself at him too, but her abrupt sexual attraction to a man who just so happens to be amazingly rich and successful is just a little much. I also find that Ana's personality is a bit annoying (no, I don't find her naiveté to be cute or endearing) and would like to note that the way Ana talks about her subconscious and inner goddess makes it seem like she has multiple personalities (not sure if anyone else noticed that but it's a little weird.)<br /><br />Overall, I understand that this is supposed to be erotic fiction and fantasy, which supposedly began as Twilight fan-fiction, but it's definitely lacking. The story progresses too quickly and there needs to be more character development (aside from Ana going from virgin to insatiable super freak). And although there are two more books that allow for my desired character development, I'm not hopeful.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Child's held my attention, but this story was not nearly so gripping as his earlier ones.  Or perhaps I am just jaded.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game, and it is just like the one at the fair but I don't have to wait for the next time the fair / carnivals are in town!!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|I like the Jack Reacher books.  They are full of action and suspense (sometimes a little romance) without being over the top.  I have a Kindle and it is nice to be able to read at night without waking up my husband.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a lot of fun! hours of super fun. I recommend getting this game. very addicting ... my kids love it!
B00991TCOG|4.0|I know I'm going to incur some wrath for rating Lindsey Stirling's first full-length CD four stars instead of five, but hear me out. All of the tracks on this album are Lindsey's original songs and nearly all of them are AMAZING. I promise you, if you pop this CD into your sound system, you'll come to believe that the violin can be a pop / rock / hip hop / dubstep instrumental choice as valid as a guitar, keyboard, or drums.<br /><br />But here's my gripe: the disc doesn't have any of the covers or collaborations that launched her popularity on YouTube. I understand that licensing issues are tough to surmount and that there's something to be said about an all-original portfolio of work, but I can't deny either that I feel there's a void without her LOTR or Zelda medleys, or her interesting takes on Rihanna's \\"We Found Love,\\" J-Lo's \\"On The Floor,\\" and Bruno Mars' \\"Grenade.\\"<br /><br />To me, it feels like there's a piece of Lindsey's personality missing. Having said that, her original compositions make me want to get up and bounce... and that's pretty awesome for an instrumental CD. In my collection, Lindsey Stirling has earned a spot with such modern violin marvels as David Garrett and Nuttin' But Stringz.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great picture quality! Love the easy access of instant video. Loved it. A big fan of the show<br />Will order again.
B003Y5H5HY|3.0|The price and delivery were right on the mark, the problem; digital disc was a re-copy not the original. This was not in the description even tho it was used.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|this is my first book of his to read...his writing isn't easy reading, but it is worth sorting through all the language to get to his point.
B003L77G10|2.0|This is not a review about the show, the actors, or the storyline. All of those would earn 5+ stars. However, on each of the discs in the Second Series, the video is breaking up, stopping, or skipping ahead. We had to purchase a Skip Dr CD/DVD Repair kit and while that is taking care of part of the problems, you can still tell the disc and/or recording quality is not 100%.<br /><br />We were enjoying Season One so much we ordered Season Two months before we could get to it. That meant we did not know about the faulty quality until about a month ago. Because the window to get a replacement expired in August, we have to live with the bad quality disc. Yes, all other DVDs are playing just fine. So it is not our equipment that is at fault. Very disappointing.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Useful for everyone to read and know. I will definitely use some of these techniques through the rest of my life!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I am really debating whether to give this a 3 and a 4 - I like the story, I like the suspense - writing failed me some, aside from the fact that some minor stuff was missed by editing I hated the repeated scenes, word for word when she is remembering the attacks from Nathan it was the same scene as in the first book. What kept me from giving it a 3? Story still intrigued me, I didn't leave it halfway through I finished it and I am still looking forward to reading the 3rd book. I want to know what happens to their story.
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|This is a very cool CD, I relley enjoy it when I'm driveing across the usa, you see I drive a 18 wheeler truck. For a liveing. I'm planeing on buying moore songs at a later time.<br /><br />Mr,David A.Brown
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read every Jack Reacher book ever written... so it is easy to say I was waiting with huge anticipation for this next novel.<br /><br />I am struggling to find words to discribe the new Jack Journey... Jack became my hero many years ago... from the first book, I knew I could not get enough of this guy. Mr. Reacher remains and will always be my hero... but I am sorry to say this book of Mr. Reacher's travels and troubles left me somewhat disappointed with Mr. Child the author. I feel the author let Jack down and me.<br /><br />In the first few pages you can be sure to be swept away into the new and next tangle of trouble Jack always seems to get himself into. Mr Child is brilliant with this exhilarateing writing technique and sweeps you right into Jack's world.<br /><br />I read this latest work to the last page as I will never stop reading till I know what the universe is going to do with Jack... but somewhat bored and distracted with all the manic, somewhat tedious and complex figuring Jack did this time... I laughed and told my husband (who has also read every JR Book)...that I felt Jack was developing a compulsive disorder!<br />My husband is next to read this latest Jack-Journey and he will probably love it being an engineer, and all the figuring and calculating Jack goes through this time.<br /><br />I enjoy Jack more when he solves problems through his uncanny instincts of the human condition and \\"Ockham's Razor\\" ...The law of economy or succinctness. A principal stating that among competing hypotheses, the one which makes the fewest assumptions should be chosen.<br />I have learned so much through reading how Jack implimented these two elements into his decision making process. I have \\"ahh-ha\\" moments reading Jack Reacher novels... I didn't have any this time.<br />So I now patiently await the next one.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I looked forward to the launch of this series and unfortunately was not all that interested after the first episode.  I decided to give it another chance and watch a couple more episodes and I am completely wrapped up in the story now.  I would have to say this is probably my second favorite series on TV right now and would HIGHLY recommend watching it, just make sure you watch at least 3 or 4 episodes.  You'll be hooked.<br /><br />What I really appreciate is how the different characters are introduced and the fun of trying to figure out who they are.  The plot ACTUALLY makes sense and the story runs smooth. I absolutely love this series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|mindless fun that I look forward to morning and night.I recommend it to all my friends. I look forward to more games like this.
B005PK553C|5.0|I fell in love with this series after the first episode.  The story is so twisted and odd that it makes for a VERY interesting series to follow.  If you haven't seen it I would recommend at least giving it a try with the previews.  Can't WAIT for season 2 starting on 10/25/12
B000GWE44U|5.0|Every single scene in this movie is brilliant. I shudder to think of the deep recesses of the mind that King, Kubrick and Nicholson went to to create this horror masterpiece, but I thank them for it! The Shining is one of my all time favorite movies ever. I cannot heap enough praise on it! Essential Halloween movie-marathon viewing every year.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always, Jack Reacher scores!! Reacher is such a complex yet understandable character and I always look forward to the next installment. When I first read a Reacher novel, it was not the first in the series so I returned to the beginning and have been enjoying him every since. I am looking forward to the movie on Reacher soon to be released although I might have a hard time with Tom Cruise playing the big guy. I think I may have gone with someone like Daniel Craig!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My wife and I saw the first movie and said we HAD to get the books.  We bought a set of books for our daughter and we chose the eBook of the trilogy for our iPad and Nook Color. These stories are very exciting and we recommend them to everyone.

B00992CF6W|2.0|As I was playing this game, it became VERY annoying that over 5 TIMES that it did not save. 3 HOURS of work did not save AT LEAST.  Also I found that there is only 1/4 of the items that are in creative mode. TNT, but nothing to set it off with. No redstone, diamond, gold, lapris, iron, or coal. There was only the ore of the stuff. Finally, there is no way that there could be a cave, trying MANY times to find a cave by digging straight down. Overall, if the next update fixed all of these things, I would definetley give this game at least 4 stars. If this game costed less, I would give this game 5 stars.
B000E9910W|5.0|Purchased this CD because I love this artist. The clarity of voice, the instruments, the music, absolutely &#34;LOVE&#34; it. The price was reasonable, the product arrived on time, I am very pleased with the purchase. It seems only Amazon specializes with the 'older artists', and the availability of finding thier product online. Very satisfied with my purchase, and I highly recommend it to others.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|While there are moments of the 'good old Jack Reacher energy & grit' in this offering, I found myself less satisfied by snacking on it as compared to the feasts I  devoured in earlier efforts. (Although I did enjoy it much more than the book written just prior to it.) Perhaps I need to go back and re-read Lee's earlier efforts, as that telltale break up cliche \\"It's not about you, it's really more about me,\\" seems to resonate with my feelings.<br /><br />I missed the occasional dosage of wry humor and Reacher intellect sprinkled throughout earlier efforts. Maybe it really IS more about ME.  I fear I may be disengaging from Jack, mourning perhaps. My feelings of distaste regarding the audacity of Tom Cruise attempting to portray Jack Reacher may be causing me to pull away. This \\"jump the shark\\" turn of events kept me from really digging into this work. Yes, it's MY problem, fellow Reacher devotees. I'm sad, angry, and in denial. Maybe I need to sell my house, get rid of everything but my toothbrush and the clothes on my back, walk out to the interstate and stick my thumb out. I'm not ruggedly handsome, not wearing duct tape, but I am taller than Tom Cruise. Bye.
B00338QENI|5.0|Very well written and researched book! This book ought to be a must read for everyone, everywhere! I loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I first played this game on my brothers ipod touch while we were sitting in the Emergency Room waiting for him to get an actual hospital room. Ever since then I've tried to find it for my Kindle Fire and I just now found it
0307592731|5.0|Very well written book by Ms. Cheryl Strayed! Book was well researched and definitely full of lifes lessons! Would recommend this book to anyone!
B000MD7OKY|5.0|Good acting, fun plot, suspenseful, great scenery , they just don't have acting like this anymore.  Everything today is CG. We have't met a Cary Grant movie we haven't liked.  My teens love his movies...even our action packed boy.

B008N5UX9M|2.0|I am a huge fan of Melodic Power Metal, Priest,Queesnryche(early stuff)UFO,Maiden.I know it is a solo/side project, and I know it is not going to sound like Maiden. I can honestly say this album, for what it is,lacks strong melodies,astonishingly weak production,and very little that grabs the listener,be it a catchy melodic chorus or a REAL groove,no powerful riffs,since the production on the guitars is pretty thin. In this day and age, and with his history/experience, I find it almost impossible to believe Steve Harris would put forth an album with a mix/production as mediocre as this. I was really,really surprised.
0805028846|5.0|Ordered this book for a friend that is locked up and has limited supplies. He loves this book and stated it gave him great ideas and creativity. Customer service was great (as usual with Amazon.com), it arrived on time, great condition. Only problem; all companies dont put invoices in thier shipments. He cannot receive any books without the invoices. Why would a company ship ANYTHING without an invoice? However they do! My only complaint!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Characters are warm and funny and very likeable. Story line is laugh outloud hilarious with interesting historical facts woven throughout.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|If you don't purchase another Whitney Houston CD, this is the CD to purchase. Has all of the great hits!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I liked \\"A Wanted Man.\\" Reacher is aging gracefully. No sex this time, just looking. I like most Reacher books, kick back with a fun read. I didn't like the one where he was captive most of the time, or the one where he kept sneaking into the same little town. Otherwise, nice.
B000002VMD|5.0|Who doesn't have this CD? Who hasn't heard this CD? Who hasn't sung &#34;I Will Always Love You&#34;?!?.....Great product! Love it! Whitney Houston at her zenith!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fabulous book.  A very quick read as it is very hard to put down.  Hopefully there will soon be a 4th!
B006IYG5HE|4.0|The first half of the book is a lot of background and not very interesting.  It really picks up when Harry Hole gets involved.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you read this book, then head over to 50 Shades of Black and White and see why this book is horrible for women to read. It doesn't portray love, or even real sex. It's freaky and a little scary to be honest. If this book can be a top seller, then millions of women have read this book and totally confused what sex is for.
B006NHRN18|5.0|I enjoy each episode. The characters were fun and interesting. The stories were intriguing too. I look forward to another season ..if there is one.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|so sad we have to wait another really long year for The House of Hades.But a very great read and one of the best books ever (not as good as the lost hero)I recomend you buy this book as soon as possible and whats with this kindle crashing thing,mine didnt crash at all.and one last thing:<br /><br />  DONT STOP WRITING RICK!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good book only for the insight it provides .. a little sloppy in the writing...  As our President seems to want to take credit for this  ..  it becomes apparent that  these  guys put their lives on the line and the President did nothing except to bask in the reflected glory
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|GREAT GAME. IT IS VERY ADDICTIVE BUT FUN. LOVED IT!<br />want more games like this.<br />good buy for the kindle. need to purchase it want be sorry.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is a fast moving book, but the two main characters were ultra-manipulative, selfish people.  The twist that keeps you reading is that they are totally unpredictable and you wonder what will happen next.  I can see it was left open for a sequel, but I have no desire to see what they will do next.  I was kind of hoping they'd kill each other off in the end, but instead they're going to inflict a new generation with their solipsistic ways.  So disappointed.
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|I had just gone to see and tour the Memphis Belle replica nearby and was eager to see thet movie.<br />I did not realize there were copies available at the airfield until I'd returned home. This was very meaningful to me as my late father had been a navigator on a different B-17 during WWII, part of the Flying Fortress.<br />As soon as I could I came to Amazon in a search for the movie.<br />I was thrilled to find it, and at a reasonable price.<br />I totally enjoyed viewing the movie, although I did cry.<br />I recommend this for anyone wanting to learn about the Flying Fortress in World War II
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love coindizer because it is a really fun game and you earn more coins as you gi and it gets better and better as you go along
B007GCY8FS|5.0|One of his better reacher books. Kept my interest and didn't bog down in details. Interesting how a person gets in so much trouble just getting from one place to another.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Awesome series!! Only show I really watch! I could watch it over and over again completely worth the money :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|thank God for this app love it!!!!! I cant stay off of it lol it force closes a lot tho
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Can't say enough good about it.  Lead vocalist has an incredible range and sound, band is solid, excellent artists.  Not a bad track on the recording.  5 stars
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I have all of Lee Child's books and this was one of his best.  Reacher is in<br />rare form as usual. Read it slow as you won't want it to end. As always I look forward to his next one.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love any Mahjong game, but this is the best!  When I don't have anything pressing to do,  I play this. I love it.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I have not yet finished this book, but have already read enough to highly recommend it to all those who have children in their lives that they care about.  The advice is backed by solid research and the anecdotal stories about children and schools developing and using these techniques are fascinating.  I am the mother of two successful adult children and found myself nodding my head at things that I did with them by instinct , starting with lots of hugs in infancy.  How nice to know that early bonding helped them with their current drive and curiosity.  I am now hoping for the same success with two grandchildren, and immediately taught them SLANT after reading that chapter.  Want to know what SLANT is?  Buy the book!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Am I playing the same game that other reviewers are giving 4and 5 stars?<br /><br />1. There are no hints/suggestions/helps as to how to play the game.<br /><br />2. By the time the initial 45 coins are used up, with the use of trial and error, one can get a vague idea of how the game is played.<br /><br />3. When the 45 coins are gone, one must wait 30 seconds until another coin is made available for play.  Each new coin is another 30 second wait.<br /><br />4. When one gets tired of waiting for another coin, it is possible to &quot;buy&quot; more coins.  Believe me, they really mean BUY.  Fifty coins cost $0.99.  I did not check the costs of larger quantities.<br /><br />The bottom line:  This &quot;free&quot; game will either bore you to death while you wait for the next play or cost you an arm and a leg to speed things up.
0525953728|3.0|book was well written, informative. an easy read. it was boring in some parts but i liked hearing the truthful account of bin ladens' death.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is easy to play and you think it is stupid but when u get it you cant stop playing it
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I cannot believe how many bad reviews this movie has received.  This is easily one of the best sci-fi movies to come out<br />In the last decade.  All I can suggest is to go into it with an open mind, don't expect an answer for every question raised, and<br />please forget about Alien and Aliens while watching it.  Other than being set in the same universe/timeline there is no<br />comparing the the 2.  Just sit, relax, and enjoy the wonder and what if of it all.
B000002PCS|5.0|I love this movie and the soundtrack is one of the reasons.  The music is perfect to the story and when you hear it the scenes from the movie are instantly called to mind.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was so caught up in this book. I love Gideon's possessiveness and Eva's personality. I love both characters and I couldn't put the book down.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Loved this movie! My kids and I have watched it multiple times and will find ourselves quoting lines of it!
B000V6ADNW|5.0|just one of his great albums, listen to parts of it almost every day at the gym. glad i bought it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Read this one fairly quick! I liked the sequel--I do feel like Bared to You was better.  It was hard to keep up with all the mood swings in this book from both characters.  While the love story was there and it is still INTENSE between Eva and Gideon, I felt like in this book Eva just loses her self.  She seems needy and whiny and there comes a point where she is annoying! Even with all her jealousy and trust issues, she seems to keep faulting Gideon for every interaction with any and all women when she herself is the one who betrays.  Overall, I liked the book alot.  I am hoping the third brings in some stability and at least a few weeks of not breaking up every other day!
B004QK5N5W|1.0|The adaptor does not work with the Original Ipad. Plug in and get This Accessory Is Not Supported By This Device. Not worth the money and aggravation. Don't buy if you have the Original Ipad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|was so happy to get this on my fire!!<br />I am a total Pinterest-aholic and now my addiction has gone mobile
B000YL98RG|5.0|this was the best buy there is it real nice and it new  they did a reail good job thanks guys
B007549W62|4.0|I just watched this flick on Encore. For a no star movie on the T.V. guide channel, it was really good. very underated!1?.Dark and Scarry. Hate these kind of movies but watched this one anyways...Like the Michael Biehn character especally.It Was similar to type-cast stuff on the terminator and the Abyss. Love the crazy paranoia siko type stuff in small doses along with a good story line of corse.
B006VRECO6|5.0|I enjoyed the drama because this reminded me of mad men when it started out only it's about prohibition, power, and gangsters also of course a lot sex. But it has hints of history with action about fighting over the power to who has the control of alcohol and about when little guy wants to make a name of himself in prohibition time and bring his wife the luxary of a vacuum to raunchy idea that french women invented B.Js!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book is terrific, I have read most of Ken Follets books.  Winter of the Worlds  continues in the tradition of spellbinding reading.  I continue to be amazed at his knowledge and depth of research.  Looking forward to third and last of the trilogy.<br />One more thought I sometimes feel as I am there in the trenches or crossing the mountains to enter Spain
B006VREN86|5.0|As a woman I enjoyed the fact that they give a little tribute to the beginnings of women's rights and a particular female character that starts out meek and vulnerable. But also the show is for every male that loves an excellent gangster movie only this is the grandfather of the godfather and every gangster movie that led after that was worthy of our attention and love. I don't want to give out too much because I would be spoiling it, but it's like mad men and godfather got together, for having sex and having an organized posse to do your dealings that goes as far as the cops being corrupt and the start of italian power in chicago, even though most of the story follows those in atlantic city with there big parties in which there is a new orleans style funeral saying goodbye to booze!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Not great, solid read but not even close in quality to some of the previous Reacher stories. Its a shame but Reacher may have run his course.
B007TMON8M|4.0|I think it is pointless going into whether the physics and structural engineering is sound on this game...it is after all a one dollar game that you are playing on your phone or tablet.  It seems however to be credible enough in how it shows you loading forces and how the structure reacts and ultimately crumbles or stands up to the forces.  Moreover it is a fun challenge for those who go beyond the action or sports type offerings for some true puzzle type games.<br /><br />Would like to see an option for a solution or at least some hint when you are thoroughly stuck as it can become rather frustrating after a while.  Apart from that, it is fun and you do get a feel-good, fist-pumping feeling when that train successfully crosses the bridge you designed, or knowing that your kids n three friends will not fall out of the tree house.  I am not going to suggest that you forego a structural or civil engineer on your next DIY project, but this simple concept game does make you feel that you have your hard hat on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great book. I wish we the author could write a fourth book, but I am glad it ended the way it did
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I put this  app on my kf it worked great, on the kf hd it does not work at all.I am sorry to say. what a shame,
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had a great story line , could not put the book down. Was the reason I purchased the third book.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I ca n't get enough of Jack Teacher. Absolutely my favorite character of all time. The writing is superb and fast paced keeps me interested start to finish
1577314808|5.0|There is no other book in this world that hammers you over the head harder and more consistently to stay in the present than this book. If you want to spread spiritual healing across our planet, buy 1000 copies of 'The Power of Now' by Eckart Tolle and hand them out to all the people you know, who spend most of their days regretting the past they can not change, or worrying about the illusory future. This is not a book, it's a sledgehammer, it will hit you over the head, until you finally get it, that all we have is the moment.<br /><br />Many people ask Tolle endless \\"but what about this exception\\" questions, hoping they can stump him, to thus find legitimate excuses, and reasons as to why they should stay lost in a state of anxiety, regretting the past, or worried about the future, but Tolle brings them back to the present.  Others have tried to make reasonable and valid points about planning for the future, and why one should worry about this semi-unknown forever approaching. The answer is always the same, one should certainly plan for the future, but it should not possess you with fear and keep you in a state of perpetual anxiety of anticipation, Tolle bring the \\"how of this point\\", home with warm clarity. Tolle teaches his readers they must come to peace with the unchangeable past and nebulous future, in order to embrace the presence of now.<br /><br />This book can be summed up as: the past and future are essentially illusions, the only thing that exists is this intense moment that we easily forget is right now.<br /><br />If you want to do something nice this holiday season or any season for that matter, purchase a copy of this book for everyone you know, personally hand it out to each of them and explain why this book should be read more than once. This is a life changing book that I wish was mandatory reading for all 7 billion people on earth today and the billions of future generations to come. Eckart Tolle's writings are reminiscent of Alan Watts (6 January 1915 - 16 November 1973), whose collected works on philosophy have deeply influenced every modern spiritual advocate.<br /><br />Very few people in history ever reach the state of a full blown Buddha, however, Eckhart Tolle is one of the rare people who have reached atleast the level of a baby Buddha. Whether he reaches the state of a full blown Buddha during is life time is yet to be seen, but I suspect he will. Tolle brings a powerful message down to earth for people lost in the abyss of human ego and helps them find the exit to the labyrinth.<br /><br />This book is changing the world as we know it, buy a copy today and you will never be the same. I promise you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Kudos to Tolle, FIVE STARS. Click the buy button now.
B005JN988I|1.0|i wasn't going to write a review -- i figured \\"eh, crumby episode, but whatever\\"<br />then i saw all these reviews of 5 and 4 stars, and was just plain offended<br /><br />this is a dreadful episode<br />it's tries so desperately hard to be clever, but is just bad writing<br />yeah, you don't see anything coming, but only because it is totally inexcusably random and disjointed -- not saying it doesn't make sense; you can follow it; but it's just stupid<br /><br />i loved david tennant doctor who<br />season 5 of matt smith was okay<br />but season 6 has so fundamentally shaken my faith in the show... very unfortunate
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Just like always, Lee Child comes throught again. Grips you from the word go all the way to the end.
B0099LDUFI|4.0|Right off the bat, let me say I like this album. However, I bought the edited version and you can hear it in the songs where it was edited. There is no smooth transition or alternate version of the song. This is at the least for the top song, \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss)\\" - \\"I've had a sh day, you've had a sh day, we've had a sh day.\\"  When you have words like that, don't even try to edit it. It's the f-bombs, we don't want to hear.
0525953728|5.0|Very good book. Was as good as I had heard it would be. Would recommend it to anyone. Opened my eyes to the politics involved.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was one of the most incredible books I've read in a while! I absolutely loved it. The second one isn't as good and the third one barely holds a candle, but the first one is so great. I recommend it to everyone.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|I'd recommend this movie for any expectant parent. Has some good laughs and even some touching moments that made me tear up. I didn't care for all of the characters, I feel like some could have been left out. But overall I enjoyed the movie.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Great Movie.  It's got everything you want to see in an superhero action flick.  The only complaint I have is that I want a cloud based digital copy.  I don't have iTunes.  I do have a desktop PC and Laptop.  I guess I can download this onto a thumb drive but I want a universal cloud solution.  These production companies need to get together and decide on how they are going to issue digital copies.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was good...but I liked the first one better. The way it ended forced me to read the 3rd one. All in all the trilogy is excellent.
B008532S54|4.0|I love Paul Rudd.  That said, you know his movies can be hit or miss.  The first time I watched it, I though, \\"It's OK.\\" But the 2 or 3 times I've watched since then, it's gotten funnier each time.  If you're the kind of person who wants predictable, thoughtless comedy (i.e--you found \\"Ted\\" hilarious) you probably won't like this.  If you like your humor a little less deliberate and obvious and a little more thoughtful (i.e.--you like 30 Rock) you'll find this pretty funny.  It's not worth paying full price for, but it's definitely a rental with later purchase when it's like $9 at Walmart.
B00846TTDG|5.0|If you love this great country as I do then, this movie is a must see. We don't take crap off nobody (\\"don't tread on me\\") is the theme of this action packed high-tech weaponry bad ass movie. Loved it.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|As usual, a movie with tons of hype and not a lot of substance.  Sure, it has it's funny parts, but it's really stereotypical and even boring at times.  Could have done without Jennifer Lopez.  The \\"Dad's Group\\" and Elizabeth Banks are the best parts.  The rest?  Very cookie cutter: one planned pregnancy that magically finally happened, one \\"oops\\" with a predictable miscarriage, one overseas adoption, one set of twins and one \\"delivered without drugs\\" but with a \\"scare\\" requiring bedrest.  If you're pregnant or baby crazy, you'll love it.  If you have any kids of your own, you'll have a hard time with this fairy tale.
B00932A6G4|4.0|This movie was better than the two sequels that came out. Although if someone has never seen the series might be a little lost on some of the characters. If you liked this movie check out the short lived animated series. That was very good as well. I am confused though why they put nudity in this movie but whatever. If you're a fan you'll like this.
B000FC1KBG|5.0|Even after having raised two children and having been involved with countless other babies, I found this book eye opening. I learned so much.  I would suggest this book for every new mother and opened minded  grandmother.  A gentle wonderful loving approach to learning how to successfully interact with your new baby painlessly.  I would also suggst that you might want the hard copy rather than an electonic version as you will want to refer back to pages often.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell dysfuntional, star crossed relationship started in Bared To You and continued in Reflected In You(the second book of three). She had been a victim of brutal sexual abuse and rape by her step brother and he was abused by a therapist brought in after he had behavioral problems dealing with his father's death.<br /><br />As a result both were promiscuous and unable to commit to anyone until they found each other. Their relationship, however was wrought with alleged chaeating, jealously,some violence and a lot of insecurities. There was a lot of going back and forth in their relationsip, which I found tiring at times. Anyway, there was a lot of hot sex between Gideon and Eva, and at times seem that was all there was to the relationship. I found this to be a good read regardless and cannot wait for the next book.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Re did the PBS BBC series, and this works out nicely as an update version.  The suspense is still there and the acting is great.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|There is just so much that can be written concerning a 30 minute event.  Could have been a short story and been more gripping.  Tale is interesting, but draggy.
B009AP2G26|2.0|The first three seasons of Glee were highly entertaining and contained some valuable social commentary. Season 4 so far has devolved into a minor soap opera. Missed the mark, overstayed the welcome
B000FCKGPC|2.0|More characters introduced.  Little follow-up on The Wall or other \\"left hanging\\" situaions like the two younger sons (Wolf) or the animals themselves.  It's time to start wrapping it up, and putting all the pieces together for me!  Insofar as Kindle goes -- it is difficult to go back to the pages which list characters and relationships and then return to your reading page.  I am holding off on reading  book 5.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved this suspenseful book but hated the ending.  I want a sequel.  The cliffhangers and plot twists kept me glued to this book.
B003SHDP4K|5.0|i have read this book at least twice and watched the movie heaps one of the best reads ever. he is truly an excellent story teller
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Excellent movie it really bring the point home about conservation and being green!!! I would defiantly watch is movie again and again. I think it important that people don't take the trees for granted!!!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really enjoyed the The first and second books in this series! That's why I choose to continue reading it. I feel that the last book lacked some of the excitement and thrill the first two had.
B0090EIC3Y|2.0|I expected more from this movie and it just didn't hold up. There were a few funny parts but it felt like watching a comedian trying so hard but bombing left and right. I might like it more if I were an 8th grade boy....
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I really enjoy these Jack Reacher books  very fun, and a good hero to follow.  The Hard Way is pretty typical of the books - but a clean writing job and it fits the bill for what I'm looking for.  I'm almost through all of them at this point and would recommend them to others!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel, had a great story line and the characters were believable. A very nice love story!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe had me hooked from the beginning. Intelligent show and good character development. Can't wait to finish Season 4 (have just begun that one)
B005DN5BE4|5.0|My son is in middle school.  He is self-absorbed, narcissistic, and lackadaisical.  So, I ask him to do his homework, and he replies, \\"Mom!  You treat me like a slave!\\"  There's a contest of wills.  So, I change gears and I say, \\"Son, how would you like to watch a movie?\\"  He thinks he has finally gotten his way.  So I turn on *Amistad*.  Three hours later, he is a kindler and gentler kid.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|I purchased this lego watch for my nephew who just turned five. He loves it !  Wears it every day and is interested in learning to tell time. You can add and remove pieces to adjust the size of the wrist band. You can change the ring around the clock. This is a fun and cheerful watch for kids.
B005P89F1C|5.0|I have a younger sister that is in LOVE with this singer. She has almost everything that you can think of other than this CD. It was  a great addition to her collection and exactly what I was looking for/expecting. Great product and super fast shipping. Very pleaseed.

B005LAJ16I|3.0|Howard Gordon, the co-creator of this series, was the show runner for 24 during its later years, and this show seems very much the inheritor of that earlier spy series that reaped all kinds of awards and seemed to convince an awful lot of people that its events had some sort of bearing on real life. HOMELAND is not quite as daft as 24, but in its own way it is every bit as silly. The plot depends upon a Marine (Damien Lewis) released by Al-Qaeda back to his country: no one except the series' protagonist, a bleached blonde CIA agent with bipolar disorder (!) played by Claire Danes, realizes he's secretly a sleeper agent for the other side. His mission, as we learn fairly quickly, involves a plot against the Vice-President, who in whatever alternate world in which this series takes place seems to be the most important person in the entire country (he even addresses the nation on television after a preemptive drone strike in the Mideast). The show's writers can clearly create the rhythms of suspense superlatively, but so little seems to be at stake (the Vice-President???) and the characters are so outlandish that it's hard to believe so many people have taken this series so seriously. It is gorgeously filmed, and features some of the best acting in American television in the lead roles. Although Danes still uses the same vocal tones to convey stridency as she did fifteen years ago to play Angela Chase, she's marvelous near the season's close when her character is asked to convey both mania and despondency; the unusual British actor Damien Lewis is even better as her antagonist, the tightly wound Marine with all kinds of conflicting motives. The series' worst flaw is (again like 24 before it) it seems to peddle in deeply conservative anxieties. We are presented with scenes of the Marine praying to Allah (hidden from his family's eyes) and of a Saudi married diplomat visiting a gay bathhouse (with salacious photos of him inside engaging in who-knows-what) pretty self-evidently for shock value.  And, though we are not encouraged to vicariously enjoy physical torture (as with 24), the show pretty much sets us up to cheer on the CIA's psychological torture of two of its interrogation suspects.
B0072GPPNC|4.0|I ordered this for my husband after stalling for many months.  He says it is a great movie.  I still can't watch it because I have such a soft spot for animals and can't stand to see them abused or cruely used.  I realize it has happened for decades, but choose to not put the images in my head.  If you can handle it, then I would recommend it. But have some tissues handy.

B00684J49U|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!! DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVENT SEEN IT!<br />(I wont spell it out for you but I do infer events)<br /><br />Knowing who dies at the end, who leaves \\"Seattle Grace Mercy Death Hospital\\",  now that I have caught up and watched it all, is depressing and sad and seriously makes me wonder what could possible happen in Season 9 that would make me want to keep watching this show. But that said, this season may contain the last great episode ever to be filmed for the entire series.<br />My favorite two people on this show leave, my third favorite person leaves and my top 3 otehrs are forever altered. The season 8 in its entirety is as good as any of the other top seasons like 1, 2 and 5, and has its fair share of soap opera drama. It has the token catastrophe we have come to expect from Shonda and there is enough blood and guts to keep the husbands from prying the remote from our hands but seriously, SERIOUSLY Shonda, how many more of our beloved characters must die, I mean be allowed out of their contracts before we quit watching? Eventually it will have to be changed to \\"Seattle Hospital Drama - The Replacements\\"<br />I have just watched the first 2 episodes of season 9 and they went nowhere near what I was expecting visually or emotionally. I am used to better from Miss Shonda. So if you love the series like I do, own all 8 seasons on dvd, even the bad ones.....a musical? Seriously? SERIOUSLY? Then I highly recommend this one because it could be the last one you ever have any interest in. And at least there is some sex, blood, guts and beloved doctors.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|It was a dark movie about snow white. It was a lot more violent than I prefer in a movie. Guess it reflects the typical Hollywood movie mentality.
0525953728|3.0|From the literary perspective - this book is nothing. But it never meant to have anything to do with literature, as I understand the author's original purpose.<br /><br />Neither was it made to make the guy \\"huge\\" profits, simply because it's such a crappy read.<br />No way this can be a bestseller or a \\"classic\\" longer than a couple of years after the original print and after all the \\"hipe\\" about the raid subsides.<br /><br />So everyone who says this guy is a phony or greedy - are losers or pushers of current administration propaganda. There isn't even much Obama bashing in the book. Just healthy criticism of Washington political ways in a few sentences for the whole book. Nothing that even remotely resembles a \\"bomb\\".<br /><br />Just an honest account of what and how it actually happened, from the eyes of a man, who actually did it. Plus some extra slang and pseudo-cool \\"chit-chat\\". There are no secrets revealed in this book either. All absolutely common and public knowledge.<br /><br />So, current Pentagon scare tactics are for one reason and one reason only: to make sure the book is bought and read by as few people as possible, because they want to take revenge on this poor fella, for having an interview and openly telling U.S. public that very few Special Operators actually like current commander-in-chief. Like that's a huge secret. That's a Chicago style revenge. That's all. Pathetic in every conceivable way.<br /><br />So, for all those SEALs and other special OPS folks, who bash the guy for \\"spilling the guts\\" - stop being such tools. He spilled NOTHING. Obama's administration spills more classified information in a day, than this guy could possibly ever relay in his entire book. Enough lies and propaganda from Obama.<br />Bin Laden was killed unarmed and practically accidentally. They weren't even going to kill him in the first place. And it took our \\"thinker-in-chief\\" \\"just\\" 3 months to decide to go-ahead with the operation.<br />No wonder US can't recover from the recession. Obama is such a \\"deep thinker\\", he actually forgets time is of the essence and he's there to make decisions and not to contemplate how good he would look in the history books. Empty suit. \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\", except for the zombie part. (though even that might have some merit :-) )
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|It turned out to be a better movie than I thought it would be after watching the preview. Seems there is hope for the good.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love the Reacher series.  One summer I read 14 of them back to back.<br /><br />That being said, this isn't the best one.  But Lee Child is still incredible story teller.  It's still highly entertaining.<br /><br />I did not want it to end because I know I have to wait another year for another Reacher.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you read and loved the 50 shades saga you will also fall in love with this series! Very intense story lines very well written!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The writer should have wrapped up this great story in the second book.  She is a fascinating writer and I thoroughly enjoyed her development of this story, but the zing was lost by the third book--it became tedious and I just wanted to get to the end.

B0053TMP24|5.0|Amzing must read book!!! When it first appeared in the book store it was unavailible but then the kindle brought it to me. Humourous and thrilling. Another great book by Rick Riordan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was better the the first and I really liked that one. Your heart just goes out to these 2 as they find their way to each other. Just when you think things may work out for them, something or someone interfers. It makes you wonder if you could have ever had sex like that. I can't wait for the next one.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This movie's action was compelling from start to finish - and the finish was startling! The way the characters reacted to their plight was believable and contrary to what you often see in disaster movies. There were no unbelievably brave heroes here - just real, every-day men doing their best to survive. I loved this movie.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Copy is excellent! Good movie even if you dislike nuns. Audrey gives the performance of her life. She was nominated for best actress but lost. As you watch this movie , keep your eyes on her eyes. They act just as well as she. Good movie and good transaction with amazon.

I am a little disappointed after reading page by page this book.<br /><br />This are not the best book you can have.<br /><br />I suggest this book:<br />Makeup guide by Rae Morris.<br /><br />Thanks,
B00932A5QA|2.0|I loved the original Starship Troopers. I rented this movie not realizing it was an animated feature. The animation only made the poor dialogue stand out. There is no chemistry between the characters on screen. This movie would have been much better if they had used live actors.

B000PAAH3K|5.0|This book was an eye opener!!  He really describes the way we may decisions in the \\"blink\\" of an eye.  But he also discusses how there are times when you cannot make decisions like that.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanted to learn more about non-verbal communication.  The book also gave me a better understanding of autism.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is about a senior citizen who suddenly decides to climbs out the window of the \\"home\\" he is in, and takes life as it comes, having all sorts of unlikely adventures.  Really enjoyed this book and its characters.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was an excellent read.  When I first started reading it, I thought \\"Agatha Christie\\".  But the further I got, I decided it was more \\"Hitchcock\\".<br />The story opens with a young couple getting ready to celebrate their 5th wedding anniversary.  The husband leaves for a few hours, and when he comes back, he finds his wife is gone and what appears to have been a scuffle, has occurred in the house.  The rest of the story reveals (in a very clever manner), how the couple got to that point in their relationship, and then what happens over the next several months.  I highly recommend it, especially if you love trying to figure out a mystery.

B0094KF4WG|5.0|I haven't finished reading the book yet, but it is certainly a very interesting read written from the perspective of one of the Navy Seals who went on that mission, one of the groups lost their Black Hawk helicopter as they were about to land so had to jump to safety before it crashed. No casualties. They never said what caused it, but it must have been a very hairy ride for the Navy Seals on board.
B004JHY8A8|5.0|I haven't seen the movie everyone remarked about when I told them what i was reading. I was glad - I get more from a book and i thought this was a good read somewhat horrifying being reminded what some people had to experience. Weeks afer finishing the book a friend (also reading the book) and i were stopped in our tracks outside the Austerlich train station in France when we spied a plague on the wall. This was in French but we could easily read enough to know it was in memory of those who left from ther for the camps. Read this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good app lots of games 101 plus 27 this is a review for the game fun cool awesome addictive fun
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Another good Reacher read- he's older but much the same. Layers of government bodies involved in this intrigue.<br />Read last into the night with this book.
0767827791|4.0|Glad to have it on DVD, sometimes when you fast forward the talking is out of sinc and you must hit the button again.  Have always liked this movie, so am dealing with the problem.  If you like Kim Novak and William Holden, you will like this.  I like to watch it from my portable DVD player, put you right into the movie.
B0026HRHTW|5.0|Relive everything you wish you could forget about the 60's, and put your sophistication aside. Go ahead, enjoy the bad puns and potty humor-- it will make you a better person.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I read a few posts where people commented on it having too much filler. I disagree. I think that the plot carried on quite well and that the reason the author didn't rush anything was because he's been adding depth to all the main characters as well as the sub characters. The third book ( the last one ) can be where the climax of the plot happens, which I imagine would make it feel \\"filler\\" free.<br /><br />Aside from that, the book still has some very climactic points. Way more then the first book actually.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it was a fantastic book that had me clinging to it into the long hours of the night, and I wish the third one was already published.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I could wax on and on about this work, but I won't.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, Van Morrison is a genius and this is amazing.<br /><br />Instrumentation is off the chart and his voice is as strong as ever.<br /><br />Just beautiful.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Never connected with any of the characters.  Hated them all.  Never felt the build-up or the tension the story should have had.  Awful!
B002RXZF6C|5.0|It never gets old. The makeup, set decoration, lighting, script, even the over-the-top acting in some cases, is fresh and exciting. Love it.
B008B11R1Q|1.0|When I first listened to 'Angels', I thought, okay, this isn't THAT good compared to the debut, but there's still 10 songs to get through. Boy, I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />'Angels' actually turned out to be the best song on the CD, and that's saying something. 'Chained' and 'Fiction' are \\"standouts\\" (if you can even call them that) and then after that the album is just really bad. Boring melodies/song structure + too-minimal atmosphere + lyrics that might make you cringe just make a pretty unlistenable CD. None of the songs here have any edge like 'Crystalised' and the repetition on a lot of the songs here is monotonous, whereas on songs like 'Heart Skipped a Beat' the lyrics built on top of each other in a more captivating fashion.<br /><br />Coexist is just too subtle, and the songs (had they been, you know..good) could've saved it, but didn't.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Great record! Anyone who loves Bob Dylan will love this album. The backing band is rocking and there isn't a dud on here.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I was not expecting a lot from this film, but decided to give it a try.  Someone I work with told me it was good.  I was pleasantly surprised! It is a \\"teen\\" movie, but was entertaining.  It is, of course, a modern retelling of the Minotaur story from Greek myth.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I read all of the gushing reviews and could not wait to read this book. I read it in 1 day because I skipped so many pages. Not her best work, so much was a repeat of the previous book, the sex scenes weren't even exciting. She did not have enough of a storyline for another book. I'm pretty sure I will not be buying book 3.
1594745692|5.0|My friend absolutely loves it! It comes in a sturdy humorous box made out of pretty high quality materials. The box is a little big and some what harder to carry around subtly, but the art work and design are cool enough that you shouldn't care. The box contains a little instructions booklet with some neat advertisements in the back, also the kinds of spreads the booklet gives are all neat Halloween themed like broken heart or gravestone. And this isn't even mentioning the cards them selves which all have very spooky twists and interesting undead art work.<br /><br />Why Buy: If your a zombie fan or want to have a little something more at your next Halloween party I highly recommend this tarot set. Its fun, it works, and your seekers are guaranteed to have a kick out of it.<br /><br />Why Not: If you are new to the art of tarot I don't think this is the right deck for you. As fantastic as it is the kinds of meanings and spreads it gives aren't the most detailed and the spooky twist has a tendency to alter the meaning a little. While it still has the basic definitions correct I personally believe you should have a more solid knowledge of tarot before you go in to different themed variations.<br /><br />Though if you do buy it as your first tarot deck it still has everything you need to do some readings right away from Major Arcana meanings to different kinds of spreads to use.<br />Either way this is a good buy.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|When you finish you'll want to read it again (or throw it at a wall.) It's almost a puzzle, a riddle, a real thought-provoker. The writer is a provocative storyteller. I still think about the story and the meaning behind it all, and I finished it a couple of weeks ago...Can't imagine how this book will translate into a movie and retain its essence, but of course,  I will see the movie to observe how the story is told in cinematic format. Also wondering how it will be rated, not for sex, drugs or language, but for violent content inappropriate for children...Of course the film maker might tell a little different story. At any rate, whatever one's take on the book, it's a story about storytelling!<br /><br />Now, for my own version of Life of P.I. (Pine Island, that is). This won't mean much to you if you haven't read the original Life of Pi:<br /><br />I find myself living on an island in SW Florida. I am trying to survive it until I find another place to land. Living here is hard because it's a place where people fish, or drink alcohol, or both. That's pretty much IT. The activities are not mutually exclusive, and both activities can begin at daybreak. I neither fish, nor drink, so I have to find other activities to keep me busy. Having found much beauty and solace in the great outdoors in the past,  I've tried hiking through P.I.'s  overgrown  woodlands. I've tried kayaking the many waterways on and around the island. I've greased up my green thumb, and tried planting a garden, a rewarding pursuit in my past, living in other places. Here? All of those things are horribly disappointing! The air is thick with biting insects, some of whom could kill you if you're allergic or there's a mosquito-borne virus in the area. Fire ants crawl up your legs and deliver a fiercely painful bite--not one, but hundreds, all together now \\"let's really hurt this person.\\" The bites fester and swell with pus and angry redness; infection often follows. There are poisonous brown recluse spiders who hide in your kayak and garden, lurking there to bite and possibly kill you, too. Never mind the snakes! Snakes lurking in the woods, in the water, in your garden. Rattlers, cottonmouths, coral snakes. You can never be too careful! Behemoth alligators swim whereever it's wet....beware! Did I mention the heat? It's relentless...burning, smothering, wet, nasty and oppressive. You can never escape it, night or day. The sky seems to be bearing down on you. And forget hurricane season! It's so nerve-racking and dangerous. Best to stay indoors and hope the air conditioner never stops working in home or car. This place is hell on earth!<br /><br />or, if you'd prefer I can tell you the story of P.I. without all the animals, at least not the nasty ones:<br /><br />Have I told you about my home, P.I. (Pine Island)? What a glorious place! The island folk are laid-back and friendly--they'll invite you out to fish on their boat or buy you a beer at the local saloon the first time they meet you. I was here during Hurricane Charley which was unpleasant and nerve-racking, but afterwards the people on this island pulled together and helped each other put our lives back together, like nothing I've ever seen. \\"Love thy Neighbor\\" truly practiced here...The island is luxuriant and forested--the predominant colors here are blue (the water and the sky) and green (the color of the woods that keep this island different from other barrier islands.) Oh, and I shouldn't forget the multicolored flowers, dragonflies and butterflies that flourish here in island gardens, along the roadsides, and in the woods. Large pink birds and brilliant white ones can be seen flying across clear blue skies or brilliant sunsets over the gulf. The warmth here embraces like a light blanket even when people in the north are shivering under real ones. At night the air is filled with the sound of bald eagles calling to their mates, and the delicious aroma of night blooming jasmine. There's so much to do! Fishing, hiking, kayaking, birding, gardening, trying to spot native wildlife, socializing with the locals. This place is heaven on earth!<br /><br />Which version is true? I wrote them both, and on different days have believed both versions. Just like The Life of PI.ishing, hiking, kayaking, birding, gardening, trying to spot native wildlife, socializing with the locals. This place is heaven on earth!<br /><br />Which version is true?

B007MNV5WU|3.0|I definitely do not like Space Birds game as well as the others.  The games are a lot harder to win (with 3 stars which is always my target) and take lots of time.  I am tired of the game before I finally get 3 stars. Past-time games should be challenging but mostly fun.  The fun games are few and far in between.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Surprising, shocking, suspenseful, over the top. Could not wait to get the third book downloaded to keep reading what was going to happen.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Follett knows how to spin out a lengthy tale effortlessly. If he adds nothing new to the drama of the world's slide into a second world war (and if it has been done better), still, it should be hard to make the story boring. But this book is deadly dull to the point of being annoying. Why?<br />  First,because its characters are uniformly one-dimensional, being hopelessly stereo-typed. Granted, character development is not Follett's forte, but couldn't the characters be something beyond straw-man (or straw-woman)vehicles for social commentary, or at least present some occasional, humanizing surprises?<br />  So, the characters are simplistic --- at least the plot should be strong. After all, the times and materials could hardly be more extraordinary, and Follett is practiced at his craft. Sadly, the plotting is so predictable, and so weighted with social preaching, that even the natural drama is diminished. An historical novel almost inevitably will have a social viewpoint, and this is not necessarily a bad thing; however, a well-written story need not sink under pedestrian politics.  Good historical fiction meets the challenge of connecting characters and personal sub-plots with the grander scheme of events, e.g. offering insightful analogies, credibly injecting your \\"witnesses to history\\" into the right places and moments. Here, by contrast, the characters conveniently trip across one another by lazy contrivance, and rarely seem to come together naturally. Far worse, the reader is smothered with over-wrought analogies to drive home political points. To use one early example: Are Berlin Nazis systematically brutalizing and murdering political and racial enemies really the political and moral equivalent of thugs in a Buffalo labor dispute? For that matter, must all union reps be burdened with uniform nobility and all business owners and operators analogized to Nazis, as the author not very subtly insists?  To put it more generally:  Aren't the readers of historicalfiction entitled to a little more respect for their ability to discern good and evil, or perhaps even occasional shades of grey?  Follett's messages would be more persuasive if not for the overloaded adjectives and adverbs evidently intended to help us get the point.<br />  So, ultimately a very disappointing performance by Follett. He has demonstrated a good command over broad periods of history, a nice instinct for historical detail, and (elsewhere) the ability to spin a fine story. Not this time.

B008Z9YLV2|4.0|A very good movie with a well developed plot that was faithful to the novel, although character development suffered occasionally from clumsy dialog. The acting was solid and believable. I could not think of a single actor for any character who would have been an improvement. The costuming and sets were especially suited to the story, maintaining a familiar atmosphere with a slightly exotic, futuristic flavor.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has come through again with book two of the the Century Trilogy.  His research was complete.  His characters are very believable.  He has captured the mood, customs, and dying way of life of the 1930 and 40's in Germany, England, Russia, Wales and the United States.  It is interesting that he writes the book from a  democratic socialist and communist point of view.  Not being a socialist, it was interesting to me to read some of their reasonings and beliefs; not being a communist, it was still hard to understand the reasoning behind the evil that is communism. I learned a lot about Nazism in Germany, and just how the common German people were treated if they did not go along with Hitler and his evil.  He did not touch much on the holocaust; except to remind us that not all the German people knew what was going on; Including the cold blooded killing of the mental patients to cleanse the land.  I thought it was ironic how his German spies for Russia were treated at the end of the war when the Russians overtook Berlin.  This book is large in scope and I think Ken Follett handled it well to bring it down to where it does not sound like a history book.  I can recommend this book, and I can't wait for the third book to be released.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Spanish or Spanish subtitles please let me know thanks<br />jcml.;pbp78@gmail.com grtan am fan of batman and this trilogy was the best thing that has come<br />and as a good fan will have the collection in my country unfortunately these things do not get so good so I ask if q help me in Spanish to make my purchase thanks
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the third time I've read the books.   I always find something new in them.  I will probably never stop reading them over and over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was an awesome book to read. All three books were amazing! Once I started reading them, I couldn't put them down. I read all three in about a week, and they were AMAZING! I can't wait for the rest of the movies to come out.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|The collectors edition I received was well packaged, the book was a great complement! Pictures details on the series, comments, I've never seen it presented this way! I was impressed!
B0095R64AO|3.0|I love these actors and always enjoying watching them, especially Emily Blunt.  However, this movie was agonizing to watch in the beginning.  We almost didn't stick with it through the middle, but it did finish strong.  It was a good movie overall with a comedic heartfelt story line.
B001V5CIFI|4.0|what a treat - transformation, romance, and happy endings! little terrors are tamed by the indomitable, magical, Nanny McPhee. Emma Thompson plays the title character to perfection.
0316227706|5.0|Seth Casteel obviously has a way with both dogs and a camera. These photos are like nothing I've ever seen. So much fun! Making it even more fun is the photos of the same dogs on land. Their personalities seem to be completely different from land to sea. Cover up the names on the underwater dog pictures and try to match them to their land photos. Some are unrecognizable.<br /><br />I know what all the animal lovers on my Christmas list are getting this year. Probably some non animal lovers too. Can't wait to see what Mr Casteel does next!
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day is an understatement. The missions that are accomplished by the US Special Forces are super human. These elite fighting men are the best in the world at what they do. They put their lives on the line constantly to help keep our country free and make the world a safer place.<br /><br />Reading this book is an adventure and it makes you proud to be an American. I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everyone needs to expands their minds plus it is very well written. Great story line and I couln't wait to get home to read it. I haven't read a book in years and I finished all 3 in one week.
B008D37J6O|2.0|I downloaded this app to my Archos 101 Internet Tablet and was extremely disappointed when I tried to view videos already on my device.  Start up was very slow and playback was extremely poor and 'jerky', as if it were buffering streaming content.  I do not recommend this app for the Archos tablet but it may work well on other Android powered devices.
B000FC1IPO|2.0|This is just another knock-off in the post-Bridget Jones female heroine genre. Except there's too much to not like among the main characters to make them sympathetic or even memorable. Must every novel produced in England include those clever little emails meant to provide character insight? While there were a few laughs, this was a disappointment. I feel like I've read it before. A few times. Enough. You do know how she does it. The real question is, do you care?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Can't wait to begin the next book in the series. Now i need 10 more words for this review. Sept 2012
B000I52LUO|5.0|Another creepy psychological thriller. It will keep you guessing (although I see some reviewers say they had it figured out all along --we're very prouda ya!) The twists and unexpected turns made this one very edgy!<br /><br />I read the reviews with low ratings and it seems they all come from people who express trouble following the plot line. That confusion is there for a reason. If you like movies that do not compel you to think and wonder, it will not work for you. If you like Rod Serling (I saw a few Serling fans in here) then you will be pleased. It has nothing to do with Fight Club or the Number 23, so don't be misled by folks who have a hard time with One of These Things is Not Like the Other.  LOL!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is by far one of the most amzing and successful trilogies of all times. Suzanne Collins came up with a brand new and unique idea that she elaborated on very well.<br /><br />The story of the young Katniss Everdeen living in what used to be known as North America shows how hard of a life her and her family have. Between the Capitol controlling their every move an the daily hardships of things like gathering food, Collins captures everything in stunning detail an astonishing imagery. And when all the districts have to come together for the annual reaping for the Hunger Games, brave Katniss volunteers to be thrown into a death match instead of her sister. Katniss, along with the boy from her district, Peeta, are thrown into the arena, where it is a death match between the kids of all the districts. Now the scenes described are a little violent, kids brutally murdering each other, but through the eyes of Katniss it shows her struggle to get past this and survive.<br /><br />A little love story is interwoven between the brutality and hardships of the story and it shows how even he underdog can be the hero, or heroine on this case.<br /><br />I would definetly recommend this book and the rest of the series. I have read them multiple times and fallen more and more in love with the books. Its a great read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I actually like this game! it is not bad and it's fun! I'm glad I got this app for free. ;)
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. The story through the eyes of Clay Jensen is flawless and relatable in so many ways. The story of his cruch committing suicide and him following her paths to discover what shes been through and her memories is unique and compelling. I have read this book numerous times and with each time I fall in love with it more and more. I dont want to give away any more! But i would definetley reccomend this book to everyone it is truly a amazing pieceof literature.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|yea this is an awesome game that i play all the and i have fun i think every one enjoys multiple games woo
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was an extreme pleasure to read. The storyline kept you reading until you finished the book. I enjoyed it immensely.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|Didn't like it as good as the others. Some areas of it were almost impossible to complete. Still working on some of them.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I'm not sure what you would expect from an alarm clock, but this doesn't function as a clock much less an alarm.
B0096YBEIS|5.0|Once again Fourplay came through. You can always count on them for a good album. For the Contemporary Jazz listener, you can't go wrong. Individually these guys are great. As a group, they're even better.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|All of Lee Child's novels with Jack Reacher are extraordinary - this one is no exception.  Lee Child is one of the few gifted authors of suspense/crime who can create a unique story-line each and every time.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|This is a great album.  True P!nk music, every song is great. If you are a P!nk fan you won't be disappointed and if you aren't this album will make you one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great is all I have to say. Really give you more detail of the characters. A piece of art. Can't wait to finish the third book and see how they film the second
B001NLL93W|5.0|I have read all five of the Mortal Instrument books and can't wait untill the next one is released. I must say perfect ending. I only shim over reviews because reviewrs feel the need to summarize and spoil it for others. Just enjoy..
B007HGPBRC|4.0|Interesting and keeps you guessing, but it's not great literature. It's much lighter than many of the Nordic mysteries these days.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|This movie ages quite well. each scene still sizzles, and the cornnfield scene is as fraught with peril as ever. The lush backgroud throughout, and the cast make this one of his best! I love this movie, and I recommend it highly.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|If you haven't watched it yet, give it a try. I dare you to watch just one episode. The series is well-written, and provides a glimpse into the the 1960's in America that is not as often represented.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|lots of fun ... I like to play it with my daughter we take turns dropping coins .... lots of fun .... the excitement of the arcades in one little app
B0070NSPCU|5.0|One of the best stories I've read in a long time and not just because I only paid $2.99 to download it to my kindle! I was sucked in quickly and was at the 81% mark in less than a week! Strong characters and a well drafted story that feels like the author knows exactly where the story is going but is not going to reveal the direction until he is good and ready!<br /><br />I was hesitant to start it because while I love a good fantasy, I dread long battle scenes that detail every blow by blow. Mr. Ryan does an excellent job of describing the fight/battle without getting bogged down in detail. Yet you have a clear understanding of what is going on, but not always why - which is what makes this a good story.<br /><br />When I was about 3/4 of the way thru the book I went looking to see what the next book would about and am sad to know it is not ready to be published yet. I will definitely be watching for it's release but will enjoy reading this one a time or two before the next one is ready for download.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|In spite of all the media hype depicting this book as \\" Mom porn\\". I found it to be a mentally stimulating love story with a few steamy parts.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|it was awesome. I really enjoyed the story line . I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys mysteries.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Great movie.  Might have been a little confusing if you hadn't read the book...or at least you would have been missing important parts of the story.  Well done though.
B000W178XO|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Johnny Cash hits.  I highly recommend this purchase; it is perfect for the first-time collector.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an amazing and riveting beginning to what I think is one of the best book trilogies ever written. It is extremely captivating, and does an amazing job of making you develop personal, intense relationships with the characters. I bought this book on my kindle for a flight across country, and ended up reading all three of them by the time I returned from my trip. Whether you love reading or hate it, I promise you that you will love this series, and especially this book.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Risking to be late at work, I have decided to write this review as some of the 2- & 3-stars reviews are not doing the justice to this very solid album from one of my favorite band out there. To be fair, the originality of the band's first two amazing albums (Three Days Grace & One X) is somewhat lost here. Their 3rd album \\"Life Starts Now\\" is a little bit weak, in my opinion, but still a very good work. This one that just out is a great example how the band evolved, matured, still remaining to be the band I hooked up on when they released their 1st self-titled album. In one word, \\"Transit of Venus\\" is very melodic. Every song of it, period. There are standouts here like the single \\"Chilk Outline\\", \\"The High Road\\", \\"Anonymous\\", \\"Expectations\\", \\"Broken Glass\\", and the best song (again, in my opinion) \\"Unbreakable Heart\\". It is not heavy at all, even a bit \\"softy\\", but I still can tell, this is the Three Days Grace. This is one of those albums that you can listen to without pressing the rewind. All the way through... then hit play again.<br />I am usually very picky about sound quality. No complains here.  Although it is not a Japanese release (I'd wait until it is released in Japan with bonus tracks as their previous albums), it does sound extremely well.<br />Buy it. You won't be disappointed!
B008X8QCTO|1.0|WORKAROUND - if I zoomed the image I could then slide it over and tap on the object to retrieve it. That being said, I really hope that Amazon communicated to the game developers not place active game object in that area.<br /><br />As another reviewer said, this took forever to install and kept downloading components, but once I got started it played well and was quite fun. That is until the second time I went to the Carousel for the second hidden object search and couldn't find the last item anywhere and then I realized, Yep there it is! Right behind the    menu tab that is on the right side center and is completely inaccessible. I had talked to my mother earlier and she had just downloaded Dragonfire or some such and had the same thing happen. Didn't any of the seek and find game developers receive the x,y coordinates for where the menu button would be on the screen? Will they be releasing fixes for this issue? If I can't continue with the game because of a design flaw I want a refund. Not because it cost hardly anything, but because I don't want to support a product I can't use regardless of price. Since my game was from Alawar and my mother's game was Big Fish, I'm actually placing the blame on Amazon, development partners should have been apprised of the location of the menu tab in the fire.
B001R6AW18|5.0|WOW, THIS MOVIE LOOKS AS GOOD TODAY AS WHEN I FIRST SAW IT IN THE 70'S!!! FIVE STARS IS TOO SMALL AMOUNT TO GIVE THIS!!!! IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS.....GET IT TODAY!!! IF YOU LIKE MONSTERS AND DINOSAURS AND FUN ACTION....GET IT NOW!!! IGNORE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I've read every Reacher book and have loved almost all of them.  This one however was a dud.  Unrealistic, complicated story line, which goes nowhere, and takes half the book to even try to get there.  Very little action, lots of driving around a dreary state, inane dialog.  Definitely not one of Child's best.  I won't give up though.  Hopefully the next one will be much better.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  As of 12/20/2012, I have returned this headset for a refund.  I have replaced this headset 3 times in total and all of them ended up having too many problems (mainly with audio).  Logitech is hard to work with and it seems most of their tech support are not knowledgeable about their own products and their problems so if you have a problem with this headset, as I did, you're on your own.  Before anyone asks, the only OTHER wireless product I have that could be causing audio/interference problems would be my router.  But my router is no where near me or my room AND the router is set to \\"Channel 11\\".  Also...  The right side audio of the headset started to fail.  The audio began to get lower and lower.  Other audio problems included random popping, crackling, distortions, and the headset CONSTANTLY turning on and off.  Again, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.<br /><br />As of right now, I'm looking towards buying a WIRED 7.1 headset.  Specifically, the [[ASIN:B006ZS5ATM Plantronics GameCom 780 Surround Sound Stereo PC Gaming Headset]].  I've heard and read really good reviews AND it's budget-friendly.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day takes you behind the scenes on Team 6 and what it takes to be the elite men who took out Bin Laden.  Gain insight to how the Seals trained to prepare for the mission and also learn how politicians act outside the media's eye.  Finished the book in one day - a fascinating read.
0205313426|5.0|This book is still a classic. It will sit at my desk right along with a decent thesaurus and dictionary. Essential for good writing. Also note that the new illustrated version (not this book, but search for it!) is beautiful and makes a great gift.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|A book about dying will be most meaningful to those people who can relate to the living person facing the final exit. Being a Bear of fairly simple brain, I wasn't particularly a Hitchens fan, but since he was at least a few steps further along the common path, I value his insights on the experience.The book gives the reader a chance to reflect on that unanswerable \\"How would I play this hand?.\\" Hitchens' objectivity seems to have enabled him to remain in the process up to the very end, which is a lesson to all of us who consider the possibility that death might, in fact, be a real final exit. The inclusion of his wife's chapter at the end was most fortunate. It's good to consider those who're still marching forward.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is the bomb I love it cant stop playing it just like the real game I cant stop playing I'm addicted
B007PFD90G|5.0|I am not a big fan of Mr. Rushdie's fiction.  However I do enjoy reading and listening to his views on world affairs.  His life's story, so wonderfully told in Joseph Anton: A Memoir, is both fascinating and scary.  There is no fake humility in his book, but I also didn't find any \\"boasting\\" as I read in one of the negative reviews.  An author meeting some of the brilliant minds will of course love it, and mentioning such meetings is more than simple name dropping.  His life has been fairly well documented, we know that he went to big parties and met famous, and also brilliant (not necessarily the same thing) people.  So mentioning them is not meant to \\"impress us'\\" at least I did not get the feeling he was trying to.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the memoir is written in the third person.  Now obviously most of the time when someone does talk about himself in the third person it's a sign of their mental state (not a positive one I'm afraid), but in this case it was deliberate, and had a place, seeing as Mr. Rushdie lived as someone else for all these years.  At first I was a bit put off by it, but after a while I stopped noticing it, and it was not a problem.  The writing style is pure Rushdie.  It's not a straightforward, linear retelling of his life.  It's more than that, and all the better for it.  His \\"letters\\" throughout the book were quite revealing and amusing.  And while he doesn't do fake humility, he also does not shy away from several self critical episodes in his life.  Of course everything is told as he remembers and from his point of view, including his intentions (as he saw them), which the people in his life may not have understood at the time, but it's not over 600 pages of self-congratulatory back slapping as one might fear in such a book.<br /><br />Especially when we consider why he had to live as Joseph Anton.  He could have portrayed himself as this brave, selfless warrior for freedom of expression fighting against the evils of fanaticism, but he does not.  He shows us his weaknesses, talks about his fears, and recalls many incidents which do not show him in the best of light.  Meaning, he is human.  Now, unless the person fascinates me, I rarely read memoirs, this however I read with joy.  It read at times like a thriller, at times it was like a work of literature, and all of it was hard to put down and a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Mr. Rushdie's story is an important one, and one that we should all know.  Especially as we see another round of deadly protests over a perceived insult to someone's religion.  He in the end, had his victory, and is able to live openly and without fear.  However, the fight for freedom of expression is not won, in fact it's even more dangerous, deadly even, than it was in 1989.  I doubt he would be able to publish The Satanic Verses today.  What is sad, is the repeat of the lack of support from the West for similar things whenever a similar thing happens.  I don't necessarily mean that shockingly terrible Youtube clip (that was just bad, and only made to insult, but still should be defended), but real expression.  The Danish and French cartoons are a prime examples.  The whole West and East should be supporting the right of these people to publish, draw, write, say, paint, scream, do anything, such things freely, and not cower in fear because they might offend someone, or because they are simply afraid of fanatics.  because then we would have learned nothing, and in the end the fatwa would be effective in another way.but he does not.

B001N3GUIE|5.0|The Blu-ray DVD is an excellent reproduction of the original, visually stunning. The audio tracks by the Barrons sing out in pristine form.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Theese are such great books i wish there was more i never wanted this series to end!!!!!! I love Edward but I love Jacob too!!! I want more of theese books. they are a great read so if u r thinking of reaing them u should
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I think Sylvia did an AWESOME job with part 2!  Five stars is not enough...This book was just a darn good read....I finshed it and picked up part 1 - Bared To You again, so I could have a reason to re-read Reflected in You...Can't wait for part 3...Excellent read!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is really good. It is so helpful!!!!!!!!! It is so much easir than just going on the interet and typing in pinterst. So in conclusin, this is a really good prodct. It is the new instagram
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I loved this book, as I have loved ALL of the Reacher novels. The writing style just draws you right in, and you are right there with Jack Reacher, every step of the way. If you have never read a Jack Reacher book, don't worry about reading them in order. That is the beauty of these books--you can read any of them as a stand alone and you are good to go. Even though many might say that these novels are for men, and not \\"girly\\" books, I just adore them. Keep them coming, please, Lee Child....can't wait for the next one!!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|An absolute gem! Two of my favorite authors are Brandon Sanderson and Patrick Rothfuss...and I put Ryan's first book right up there in the same stratosphere of these two writing giants!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Handy to have for a relaxing break from work.  Good meditation and relaxation sounds to use with a headset or just directly from the kindle
B001NLL93W|4.0|Another great book that I got swept away in. This series is one of the best I have ever read. I'm waiting for the next book to be released and can't wait!!!
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I really didn't like this book. We read it in our Book Club and a lot of the younger women really liked it. Although everyone agreed that it was very difficult to get into. It took a few chapters. I found it too violent and cut up to easily follow. I still haven't finished it and don't think I will
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I seldom write reviews, because I don't think I'm very good at it, but I had to for this book. PHENOMENAL! Strong depth of character, very interesting story, and a world that seemed very alive. Although it reminded me of Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, I have to say this is what fantasy writing should be. I hope there will be much more from this author. RUN, don't walk, to get your copy today!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have been anticipating this sequel since I read \\"Fall of Giants.\\"  Ken Follett never disappoints.  This is written in the true novel style having various plots, locations, and characters who both interact and stand on their own.  It is a delight to read a well written, well developed and interesting book.  Well done, Mr. Follett!
B0068THAGY|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  It's got humor on alot of levels.  Very solid acting, considering the age of the cast.  Just don't take it too seriously as a sci fi movie. It reminds me more of Stand By Me or something.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|John Corey keeps you laughing the entire time the suspense builds. Love the wit he brings to each and every scene
B005LAJ16I|3.0|The show is OK. Acting is great, budget is showing but the plot is..... to naive.<br />Sure, I can believe in a POW who is turned in order to work for the enemy. Sure.<br />But a father of two, who was kept captive for 8 years, had his life almost destroyed, is trying to retaliate because his capturer's son and some civilians were killed? I just don't buy that.<br />If he came back, changed his views on war and was trying to change policies if our government - sure. But sacrificing his own life, damaging lives of his kids and loving wife (can you imagine a shame??) ? I don't buy that.<br />3 stars
B006AN78XS|5.0|Love this movie!  Nostalgia at its best.  This movie is classic Woody Allen.  Feel good entertainment for those over 50.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I am hooked on this series.  However, I think the change of story with each chapter has gotten more and more confusing as the cast of characters is now in the hundreds. It's hard to keep the names straight of all the minor characters. I can't wait to find out what happens next to the main characters.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great time waster, while waiting your the doctor or dentist a you can pick right back up where you left off. Puzzles are just difficult enough to be interesting, yet but so difficult that you become frustrated and want to discontinue play. Colors are vibrant and fun!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the second installment of the trilogy. I can't wait for the third book to come out. The characters are true to life and the stories compelling. As you read you experience the world in turmoil of the 30s and 40s.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|:) Not sure why but this is a very addicting game. I need to get up in a couple hours but I'm still sitting here dropping coins! Why? Why? Why?
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Downloaded it several months ago . Just started using it. Looks good. Haven't tried everything out will rate again probably higher after checking it out. Does show lots of so potential . Thanks
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Introduced to the music from this group on my local public radio station known for playing new and upcomming groups, both local and international(91.9WFPK Louisville, KY).Would label this music as alternatine indie rock. I Downloaded this album for one song(It's Time), but was pleasantly supprised to love them all! Some of the songs are even great for a Cardio playlist. Great deal at $5.00.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|love love love.. great graphics and not too much dialogue. cant wait to see more from big fish. keep good hogs comming...
B007TML4EI|5.0|I don't play many games, but really like this one and keep going back to it.  It makes me think and is fun.  Great game.
B000FVE3AC|5.0|excellent watch sharp looking and glows in the dark very intensely really nice watch at a reasonable price im totally satisfied with it
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I had not seen the Firefly series until this year. Going into it, I realized that the series only lasted one season. I didnt't realize, however, that the series' cancellation would leave so many unanswered questions. The movie does a great job in tying up loose ends. Even so, the movie as a stand-alone would be just terrific.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|great movie that never looked better!!! this is a must buy for any movie lover, plain and simple for the price its a steal!!!!!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Not the old Reacher! Boring! The recent Reacher books are more about walking and driving back and forth between towns, ranches places and not about the plot. More action and less thinking about time, numbers, etc.  JAC
B007THA4FI|5.0|Fantastic read in a contemporary setting. The characters had depth and the story reminds us all how we are interconnected.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok. its just that it frustrates me when I have to play the same game over and over. lol
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent-- written matter of fact as opposed to the normal I'm the baddest, ches thumping dude in a of this kind.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|As a forgetful 50 year old ,  it was so hard to read a book about one of my biggest fears of dementia .  However, I could not put this read down .  A brilliant story that pulled me in with humor and devastating heartbreak.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This four disc combo pack is just awesome!!!!  I pre-ordered my DVD about one month before the release date.  I was little worried that I might be paying a higher price... but was just glad it was going to be delivered to my door.  I was overly amazed that Amazon gave me a credit since this DVD was offered at a lower price by the competition.<br /><br />Awesome movie!!!! Awesome Amazon!!!! Enough said!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Readers of Lee Child know Jack None Reacher is the man of actions and great thought.  In this one we get pages of great thinking and explaintion but little of the action we've been rewarded with in previous novels.  I usually read these books cover to cover in one sitting.  This one drags on, so it was easy to put down and finish later expecting it to get better each time.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I like the movie overall - they did a great job with the idea behind the movie.  However, there we so many times I felt like I was watching poorly played out scenes from Twilight.  I so wish that girl would learn how to act!
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|This album has all great songs. If you are a long time Dylan fan or not, this one is a keeper!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book was fascinating to me.  It began the year my mother was born, and covered a period of history that was largely passed over when I was in school. I was born during the Great depression, raised during the second world war and I think the schools were so engrossed in what was happening in the present, that the past was just that. Past. The book brought that period of time into focus from 3 different perspectives, and I feel sheds a lot of light on the root cause of the second world war. Book Two begins the year I was born 1933. I have just begun to read it and already am blown away by the facts and detail. Altogether a really great read!
B008XG1X18|3.0|this app is frustrating.  when the app works it's great. sadly,  most of the time the app won't launch.  scroll is annoying, please add a scroll to top button like the full site.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|very slow, too much going back and forth between characters, would not recommend to anyone to read, the book lacks story line
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Boring. Does not live up to first three books. Does not need the sex as it is not true prono, but limits recommemding to younger readers. Lost train of story, therefore would not recommend.
0446572993|5.0|Succint descriptions, complex but not confusing plot and characters I cared and worried about. Will Robie and Julie stayed on my mind for days after I closed the book, and as always, I look forward to Mr. Baldacci's next book.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I'll start by saying I did not purchase this book because of weight. I purchased because I was feeling foggy, run down, and just plain \\"not right.\\" There was nothing specific. I was somewhat anemic which my doctor gave me iron pills for. Even when that cleared up, I still felt run down. I'm not overweight and I do moderately exercise and watch what I eat. Though I'm in my 50's, I refuse to believe that feeling run down and \\"not right\\" comes with age.<br /><br />I noticed after much research, that I had many of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity.. But I still was not convinced that wheat (including and especially whole grains) might be the problem. After all, anything with whole grains was supposed to be good food you. It's when I couldn't get rid of the gas and bloating (quite embarrassing), even after cutting dairy, that I bought this book.<br /><br />This is definitely one of the best purchases I've made. Dr. Davis does an excellent job in explaining the whys and wherefores of wheat sensitivity. The historical history of today's wheat is fascinating to say the least, and would be well worth buying the book for that reason alone. Who knew that wheat is genetically modified beyond recognition from it's original state? This is truly mind boggling. It is also something you will not hear from food manufacturers, nor our governments.<br /><br />I've been without wheat products, and anything else with gluten, for three weeks now. I've also added dairy back in (milk, yogurt, etc.), just not as much as I used to. How is that working? Well, gas and bloating are gone. I'm not feeling tired all the time. BMs are easier than before and I've been losing weight without trying. The \\"not right\\" feeling is slowing dissipating. Though I must say, I do miss my french rolls, donuts, and all those things I've relied on flour for. There's been a bit of moodiness and a headache for the first week or so, which I assumed was some withdrawal symptoms. 5-HTP helped with the moodiness; ibuprofen with the headaches. It's well worth whatever discomfort I might have had, to feel better. I expect to get even better as time goes on.<br /><br />Buy the book and read it. Even if you don't have all of the symptoms, even if you're just curious, read it. It's well worth the cost. You don't have to have celiac disease to have a wheat/gluten sensitivity. But that doesn't mean you are not sensitive; especially as you get older, you can become gluten sensitive. Unfortunately, there is no test for the condition. But, you can take your health into your own hands by reading this book, and then if it feels right to you, go for it and cut out the wheat and any other grains containing gluten. It may take some time, and you might feel worse before you feel better, but you will feel better.fen with the headaches. It's well worth whatever discomfort I might have had, to feel better.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Well, it looks like I already have my New Years Eve plans. Dec.31st is the release date for the last book in the Crossfire series and I CAN NOT WAIT!!! Reflected in You, the second book in the series was really just as good as the first and maybe even better. The story ended with me feeling like Eva, hungry for more Gideon Cross. I am usually sceptical about 2nd books in any given series because so many times they are just a dull, flat reflection of the first book. But Sylvia Day does an amazing job of keeping the readers interest and the storyline remains fluid. Love this series!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Don't get me wrong - I LOVE the tv series; it's my favourite show. I also really loved the first in this series (Heat Wave) and I also own and treasure the Derek Storm stories. However, I didn't seem to enjoy this book as much as the others, but saying that, I still liked this plot.<br /><br />In this Nikki Heat novel, Rook and Heat are once again fighting crime as they search for Cassidy Towne's (a controlling gossip columnist, who is known for ruining other's careers) killer.<br /><br />On the Amazon link to this title, the description also states that this book is less about the tough crime side, and more about the comedy of Rook and his attraction to Heat. I absolutely agree will this as I believe that \\"Richard Castle's\\" novels are more comedy-based with a side of crime.
B0034IZVV8|5.0|I have always love the Backstreet Boys. This album is just the best of the best from them. Loved It!!
B004KZOWEG|4.0|Oh my, every European should read this book.  If they think American's created slavery, they need to think again.  I was stunned by the cruelty and lack of respect for human life.  No wonder Africa is on fire.  The warlords are simply follow their master's lead.  They rule from force and overpowering of their people.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|It was so fun to watch a childhood favorite of mine with my own children!! The quality was great and my kids loved it!!
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I was eagerly awaiting Lee Child's latest Jack Reacher adventure and ordered it in advance of availability.  The story was one long road trip and a pretty boring one at that.  The usual excitement didn't begin until nearly the end of the book and by that time I was  looking forward to the end rather than the opposite.
B00973CGXK|4.0|After their last album I was afraid the Killers had lost what made them great.  This album is a throw back to their hayday and  I enjoy it very much.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice graphics...  Fast antertaining...  Best of the Klondike games I've found so far for my Android Tablet... Bothersome ads... Is there a pay version?
B007CIQ4B2|3.0|Not what I was expecting after the first 2 songs.  The album cover indicates the watery depths that Ben Howard has attempted... an unsuccessful attempt in my opinion.

0385474547|3.0|The condition of the book was terrific, as well as the date of arrival was prompt, as promised. I really appreciate when I get exactly what I pay for. Thank you.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I only knew a few songs from this album when I got it. Now it's one of my favorite albums. It's pretty heavy in it's own AWOL Nation way. It has earned a permanent spot in my car.
B0085X31VE|5.0|Fantastic and refreshing debut! Classifying Ne Obliviscaris musical style is a difficult task. Comparisons to Opeth or BTBAM are easily drawn but that is selling them short. They've managed to carve out their own original niche in a hybrid of genre's that already cover vast musical terrain. Sure, you'll hear relentless drums, frantic guitar fretwork, but the most striking addition to their sound is the use of a violin. It's an instrument not completely foreign to metal, but very few bands can get away with using it in anything more than interludes or brief instrumental passages without being gimmicky. In Portal of I, they have managed to make the violin stand on its own and become an integral part of their sonic signature.<br /><br />Hardcore fans of death/black metal may be put off by the arrangements, but if you enjoy progressive metal at all, you should do yourself a favor and give this a listen. I'm not a huge fan of harsh vocal's but I can tolerate it in moderation. Ne Oblivscaris manages to reach a good balance on this record and I never felt overwhelmed.<br /><br />Creativity abounds and songs are well thought out and paced. Most songs clock in at over 10 minutes and manage to stay focused without ever feeling like filler. If there is any criticism I would give, it is that the album as a whole can seem a little one-dimensional, but this is really nit-picking considering this allowed them to really explore the unique musical space they've made for themselves. This is my pleasantly surprised and out of no where candidate for Album of the Year. Here's to hoping we don't have to wait another 5 years for their next effort.
1401322786|5.0|I have been a fan of Albom for many years, and again he gripped my heart from the first page and left me with the unique Albom-esque ending you know and love; in tears of understanding, and joy.<br /><br />Also just wanted to point out the name Dor could possibly be a reference to a Hindi film 'Dor' in which a similar situation occurs. (Won't give too much away but from the Wikipedia page, i'm sure you'll spot the similarity :))<br /><br />Read the book in one sitting (about 3.5 hrs) and loved every 'second' of it. :) Oh time puns!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sooo when I read bared to you omg the similarities to the Fifty series was crazy but it was still a very good book.<br />But I told myself I would give the second book a try and I loved it it. The book was def one of those books u could not put down and it kept u wondering what's goin to happen next. Loved Eva's character she's amazing I really wish the books came out a little bit faste but whatever I can wait until December
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Very boring, no real.. thats it, not real. We see this in so many movies. Kinda like a mix between Runningman and Narnia.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are amazing.  I definitely recomend them to everyone!!    My daughter loves these books and her friends did too.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Please be aware that this is the same theatrical version that was distributed by Panasonic to buyers of their 3-D equipment.  That having been said, the disc is the most immersive 3-D I have ever experienced.  If you don't already have the previously issued 3-D version, it is well worth the expense.  I assume that the extended version will be released in the near future.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Liam Neeson gives a spectacular performance. A realistic film that touches the intensity of many lives: of humans, and wolves. This not a \\" feel good\\" movie.  It is about human reactions, thoughts, perceptions, behaviors, in the midst of sudden crises. Humans encounter wolves in their natural habitat, while stranded in the middle of 'nowhere', surrounded by snow, forest, wolves on the outside, and enclosed by fear, competition, hierarchies, pain, questioning on the inside. A powerful film. Profound, not for the faint hearted.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Easy, fun, great graphics -what's not to love?!!  Not a true skill game, but relaxing and a nice way to waste a little time.
0316228532|4.0|Rowling captures the political human animal and the war between its individuals as accurately as Frans de Waal does chimps in [[ASIN:0801886562 Chimpanzee Politics: Power and Sex among Apes]].  Her writing, as always, is interesting, and her characters are fully believable.  This is not an action book.  It is a character book: the characters of small town politics and the character of a small town itself.<br />One odd recurring description, however: Rowling mentions teenage boys' erections many times in the book.  The sexuality she describes either occurs between kids, or else between adults and kids, repeatedly.  She only describes an adult sexual situation once.  I do not know what to make of this, but it puts the Harry Potter series in a new light that I will choose to ignore.<br />At its best, The Casual Vacancy is similar to some of J.G. Ballard's later works, especially [[ASIN:0312306091 Super-Cannes: A Novel]].
B007MB5OCE|5.0|From the first lineBu, I loved this book. If you know older poeple or are one and can find the humor in each age group, this book is for you. The characters are well developed. The humor is outstanding. I couldn't put it down. If you need to have some levity, then read this novel. This was a wonderful first novel for the author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All books in the Trilogy are difficult to put down but this one is the most exciting. It is a combination of a love story, mystery novel and adventure story. This one makes the sex secondary (if you can believe that). It made me really hope for a fourth book!
B0001EFTVA|4.0|As I'm a sucker for anime films, it didn't take much to convince me to snap up a copy of Tokyo Godfathers when I saw it in a cutout bin; only $3. But I had no idea what a thoughtful, touching, funny film it is. On Christmas Eve a trio of Tokyo homeless people--a bum, a transvestite, and a runaway teenage girl--find a baby girl abandoned in a trash heap. Then come their wild adventures, as they try to reunite the infant with the mother who apparently abandoned her. Of course, it turns out to not be as simple as that. Nothing is quite what it seems. By the time they finish, the three street people are well on the way to redeeming themselves and those that they touch during this nearly magical holiday season. Not only is it a good story well told, but a beautiful one, too; the snowy cityscapes of Tokyo are breathtaking. Just a heart-warming, wonderful film. One of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen. Be sure to watch it this coming holiday season.

B0098VXBIA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is for everyone, even for people without kids.  It's a great movie for when you need to laugh with either your best friend or your significant other.  I watched this movie with guys and even they really enjoyed it!
0553801473|1.0|You are not William Faulkner.  You're not even Cormac McCarthy. You're a fine writer of soap opera scripts, which is perhaps why you have NO idea how to wrap this up and end it effectively.  Like Stephen King you started with some fine creativity, and when you became famous you began to think you were smarter than your editor.  You are wrong. Get some help.  You are just irritating most of your readers at this point.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I was really interested in this film.  The previews looked awesome because of the special effects. They were amazing in this film!  I thought the Queen was the most interesting character.  Not only did Charlize Theron have the best evil queen wardrobe, she had a story of why she is the way she is and cannot escape it.  Kristin Stewart was good but it is true about her acting style - she has one facial expression for everything.  I'm not a fan of hers.  But I disregarded that because I like everyone else in the film.  Chris Hemsworth brings all his characters to life and really gets into character.  I also really loved the locations - it looked beautiful wherever it was filmed.  So overall the costumes, locations, and Theron/Hemsworth made the movie worth watching.  I thought it was a good take on yet another Snow White story.
B00785P2QC|5.0|fun game but im just doing this 4 a mission. lol lol lol lmao so so so hahaha hahaha lol lol

0345803485|1.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /> I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing the book. I was given a gift card to a book store and decided to buy this book.  Several people I know where talking about how great this book is but I don't get it.  The writing is boring and sex scenes are also boring.  There's just no heat to this book.  Nothing to hold your interest. I did my 100 page rule and made it to page 124 and that's it for me.  If you are an avid reader like I am you might want to give this book a pass.
B008N1LL42|5.0|The good guys win; worth a watch. Liam Neeson only plays a cameo role, but the story line and action makes up for his short appearances.
0500289077|4.0|i ve just received my copy, it's q very good general view if this genre, great for students or people who enjoy street, documentary, travel photography
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I am a wife and mother in her late 30's.  I love to read and this book caught my attention before it came out, due to all the controversy about revealing military secrets.  I am half way finished with this book.  It is an interesting book, but not a book I rush back to \\"find out what happened.\\"  So far I don't see what all the controversy was about.  I think the author was very tasteful in revealing what our American forces actually do and how their private lives are affected by it.  This said, I must repeat, I have only read half of the book.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I read this book because of the hype when it came out. I was very disappointed. If you watched the interviews on TV you wouldn't have had to read the book. Boring.
B0031RS44S|4.0|This book held my attention and could not put it down. Reading until early hours of the morning and just want more Jack Reacher novels.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|The watch is at least as attractive as the product illustrations. For me, the comfort of the watch and band are tops. Yes, it gains a few seconds a day, mostly expect this from an automatic watch with non-quartz movement. No less accurate than an Omega Seamaster automatic watch given to me as a school award forty-five years ago.
0345505387|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the graphic novel. It is beautifully done, and a must have for Diana Galbadon fans. The book would be appreciated by anyone that loves a good grapic novel, as it was from my son to my granddaughter.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Just love Reacher's intelligence. Once again, he's several steps ahead of everyone. As usual, never saw the ending. Good energy throughout.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Childs always delivers. His books are always hard to put down and I am sorry when they are over. Wish he could write them as fast as I am able to read them. WANTED MAN is another hit.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I bought this book because of the author.  I was very disappointed in the book.  I kept reading, hoping that it would get better or exciting but that never happened.  I liked the idea behind the book and it sounded like it would be good so i preordered it.  What a waste of $17.99.  I noticed that today it dropped to $14.99 but it is not even worth that much.  It seems like someone that has written the Harry Potter series could have come up with a better story than this.

B0097NGUJG|5.0|There haven't been many albums that have captivated me for so long. Solid from beginning to end. Great fun album.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I just finished JK Rowling's new book and I have to say that in spite of some shortcomings in the editing, I really enjoyed it.  Yes, it could have been a bit shorter and yes, it is dark.  The characters (and there are more than enough of them) are well drawn, though unfortunately, there is not a sympathetic one among them.  But sometimes life is like that. The sex, drugs, violence and foul language rang true and were not used to titilate or shock.  That's just how things are in the places Rowling writes about.<br /><br />I only read the first two Harry Potter books;  they were fun but they are for kids. The Casual Vacancy is certainly not that, nor is this fantasy.  Rowling writes like she knows the people who populate Pagford and the Fields.  After reading this book, I feel I know them, too, and though I may not like them, I'm glad I met them.<br /><br />An excellent effort and I'm looking forward to her next novel.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|Works great with iPhone 4 & 4s and the iPad 3. Plays video through RCA jacks and charges the iPhone or iPad at the same time.
1401235417|5.0|Snyder's \\"Batman New 52\\" epic is the fusion of \\"Batman\\" and \\"Detective Comics\\".  It makes you feel like blockbuster movie plot! Meanwhile, Capullo's dusk-felt coloring contrast impressively elicits the nostalgic atmosphere throughout the whole story line. He has proven grey, blue dan black are no longer the only identical colors for Batman story backgrounds. The package deserves to be the best combo of the year.

B0061PEAUY|2.0|I am an avid mystery/thriller reader.  This is the 2nd book I've read where I would have loved to send back.  Over decriptive and quite boring read.  Surprised have read this author previously.  I read the entire book but painfully.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Good solid movie.  Special effect weren't over the top, CG aliens were believable... all in all, the movie was a surprise, I expected something much more lavish, and instead got a great movie, with good actors, good action, and a good plot!  Rent it!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|It was made very well and told great stories of the time and the men who fought the war with Japan.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very fun brain teaser game I just love this game. Flow Free is my 3rd fave game. ;P
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is one of those \\"can't put it down\\" novels. The plot gets tighter and more disturbing as the story unfolds. The reader is constantly pulled one way and then the next as you try to put together the truth behind the husband and wife characters. As the intricate plot unfolds the reader is propelled into their disturbing world, and you know there is not going to be a happy-ever-after ending. But the ending hits you unexpectedly. A great read and entertaining story.
0307341577|4.0|The book has a flowing plot, however, it is not too gripping (mystery), if that is something you are looking for. I liked the way the characters are etched. Overall, worth a read once.
B00932A2MC|3.0|A fun movie with a lot of good technical effects.  The aliens have some very interesting distructive weapons that they use, who ever thought these up was very creative.  Our society could use some of them to tear down old structures that need to be torn down.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I wish I had checked this one out from the library and not purchased it for my Kindle.  Had I borrowed it from the library I wouldn't have even finished reading it and would have just returned it after the first 100 pages.  Boring, bleak and dark. Extremely predictable ending.  At least in the HP books good always wins over evil.  In Casual Vacancy nobody wins at anything and you keep waiting for her to pick up the pace, but it never happens.  All in all a waste of time and money.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|As much as I hate to say it, it appears Mr. Child is getting bored with his Reacher series, as this one felt very much like he was going thru the motions rather than creating another great story line for his readers.  He had all the usual elements - Reacher falls into a situation, he is smarter than anyone in the situation, shoots faster & straighter, is more intimidating to the lowlifes, saves the day, etc, etc., but the story was rather lame & at the same time not overly believable.  I am hoping he has a couple of new & fabulous story lines up his sleeve - maybe when Reacher finally gets to Virginia - and he can resurrect both the thru Reacher character and his story telling skills.
B005K01VZS|5.0|An excellent book that shares three lives, three stories of faith. And even if you don't really believe in faith in God, this book takes you through three stories of the providence of God as He reveals His grace and mercy in our lives even through the toughest of times.

B0046IGOIO|2.0|Ok, I will be perfectly candid and tell you that I did NOT purchase this item and please know that I love The Doors. Today,I listened to much of the set on You Tube and although it did sound \\"bootleggy\\", I especially liked the songs with Albert King. I decided to go to my local record store with the plan that I would likely buy it but thought it prudent to listen to listen to it first, particularly priced at $17.99. After listening for just a few moments on a portable cheapo cd player it was was obvious that the sound was utterly miserable, especially the painful distortion present in the vocals. If anyone wishes to rip me for reviewing an item I have only listened to in part, please feel free. I figure if nothing else, I owe this to my fellow Doors fanatics. Unless you MUST have everything my advice is simply this: STAY AWAY. Rest assured, this is not Bright Midnight's shining moment as this release is both shameful and shameless. Proceed strictly at your own risk.

B0098756DC|5.0|The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is one of John Ford's greatest efforts....maybe his his last great film.  John Wayne,  James Stewart, Vera Miles, Lee Marvin and a stellar supporting cast from the John Ford \\"stock company\\" combine their efforts for a fabulous movie.  The film is beautifully restored to a pristine print and this wonderful blu ray does it justice!
B008XFAT7S|3.0|I wasn't overly impressed with this film, but I went in with extremely high expectations due to some positive comments made by my friends (who consider themselves to be film buffs of the genre). I don't consider myself as someone who appreciates everything films bring to the table. However, I do watch a considerable amount of films so I wouldn't consider everything I have to say about them to be complete nonsense. I'll just lay out a few bullet points and let you decide from there whether the film is worth your time.<br /><br />-The film is good but not amazing.<br /> --It does the fighting stuff really well and presents it in a way that is entertaining for the majority of the flick.<br /> --It has a very \\"raw\\" feel to it, but you're reminded that it's just a film by the constant over the top fighting sequences and the ability for some of the characters to take hundreds of punches and still keep on going.<br /><br />-This film is pretty much non-stop action from the moment the building raid begins.<br /> --That is pretty much a true statement.<br /><br />-It's fun for what it is(an adrenaline-fueled kick to the face) but not ground-breaking for this sort of action/fighting genre either.<br /> --This is just an initial response. But then again I only watched the film once, so I imagine there could be some \\"revolutionary\\" bits in there that I didn't catch.<br /><br />-Lots of kicking and body parts getting smashed or stabbed.<br /> --The kicking becomes a bit tiresome as the film drags on. They seem to try and make the film this one giant, cohesive, and interesting fight scene but it ends up feeling overly drawn out.<br /><br />-If you like kung fu or action flicks (think in the vein of Ong Bak or True Legend) you'll probably enjoy this film.<br /> --It's a lot of acrobatic, in your face fighting. If you're not into that sort of thing, then this probably isn't the film for you.<br /><br />-There is not much of a story here but I didn't rent this film expecting that.<br /> --To go in expecting an amazing storyline with fully developed characters and a plot that makes a whole lot of sense would be the wrong frame of mind for this particular film. There is a story there, but it's nothing memorable. This film is all about the action and trying to present it to you in a fun and interesting way.<br /><br />Hopefully I've at least brought your expectations down to a reasonable level--if they were not already--so that the film could potentially be more enjoyable for you.r /> --To go in expecting an amazing storyline with fully developed characters and a plot that makes a whole lot of sense would be the wrong frame of mind for this particular film.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|Like others, after reading fifty shades I started Bared to you. I enjoyed it, in its twistedness. I was excited about reading this book, and stayed up all night to finish it the day I bought it. I feel like this book did not get ANYWHERE. It was just more jealousy, sex, break ups, makeups, and more sex. I enjoy the characters, but boy, do they make me frustrated!!! I started to hate Eva for not hating Gideon about some things he does to her. It's like all there is thats special between them is SEX. That's what it always boils down to. Towards the end of the book, it turned into a mystery that never really got explained throughly. I STILL feel confused about some of the actions of the characters. Eva is on her period all the time it seems. She wants to break up with Gideon, but she cant because I guess he's just so sexy. LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING. I wanted to scream at her just to find somebody else. What does Gideon have that nobody else has other than money and looks? nothing! She can't stay mad at him for 2 seconds, I cant even take her seriously. She reminds me more of a love-struck teenager. Overall, The book was a fun read. It wasnt very realistic to me, more drama. I wished something would have happend in their relationship to go to that next level. C'mon, a baby? marriage? anything?! Gideon saying \\"I love you\\" at the VERY END of the book was some sort of huge miracle and milestone for Eva...which is simply ridulous to me.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just like her prior books, this book keeps the tension and passion between Gideon and Eva going.  I am never ready for her quit retorts and endless devotion to him in spite of his \\"perceived\\" actions.<br /><br />Keep them coming.  I can't wait for the next one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the third time reading the trilogy, and i love it more every time, christian still makes me  melt
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I truely enjoyed this book.  I intend on reading the whole series.  I am not an avid reader but these books have me hooked.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|Wanted to love it, but this is not my kind of romance. Not even for a YA romance.<br /><br />SLAMMED was angsty teenage  love story with a heart wrenching sub-plot, but the heroine made it a very disappointing read. I expected a more mature minded heroine, not an overly emotional girl who thinks a mad boy crush after one date is the 'real thing'. The whole high school giggly student bit was a turn off for me.<br /><br />I liked Will a lot, and thought his maturity and love for poetry was well portrayed, but I didn't get the connection with Layken. She made dumb choices, said dumb comments, put him at risk, and made everything be about her. Personally, I thought the author did a great job of developing a typical 18 y/o girl, but it only emphasized her lack of maturity as a lead heroine.<br /><br />This would have worked for me in a more adult setting, but the the teenage angst was over done. At times she was a drama queen only focused on herself, and she had no concept of how others felt. Then other times shes a silly giggly high schooler. Either way, I didn't buy her as a convincing heroine.<br /><br />The subplot was very good and emotional, but it was great wallpaper only. The romance needs to stand on its own, not be carried by a secondary storyline.<br /><br />SLAMMED is a teenage girl fantasy romance story, so it doesn't surprise me at how popular it is. But I'd prefer to read about more mature minded couples falling in love, so this one didn't cut it for me.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Unlike other shows (e.g. Lost), Downton Abbey does not leave you with a \\"cliffhanger\\" ending at the end of the season, which would leave you unsatisfied. It is such a well-done show, I can't wait for the next season to begin.
B003L20IJM|4.0|I bought this movie to watch with my 4 year old grand daughter. We both loved the movie.<br />It kept her attention through the entire movie which is no easy task for a four year old.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Wow.<br /><br />With all the hoopla around Bared to You and it's similarity to Fifty Shades of Grey, I wasn't sure where this second installment was going to go.  But Sylvia Day took this story in a direction I certainly didn't think it would go, but it demonstrated the lengths our couple have to go through to prove what they have is real.<br /><br />Gideon and Eva are trying to build a somewhat normal relationship out of the ashes of their tragic pasts.  They both have so many issues it's sometime hard to keep track of all of them.  But at the core of their relationship is knowing they have truly found \\"the one\\" and figuring out just how they manage to keep their relationship together without pushing each other over the edge.  It's not an easy task for each of them.<br /><br />Gideon, for the majority of the time, is closed off, possessive and pushes Eva away.  Eva is just as possessive, but she doesn't trust Gideon and his feeling for her.  That is why she has a hard time believing  him when he tells her he'd do 'anything' for her.  She figures it's his way of controlling her and their relationship.  While I could understand why Eva would feel the way she did (Gideon really is an ass for the majority of this book), I found myself getting irritated with her because she was just so willing to toss Gideon aside each and every time he got her back up.  Not very mature for a woman who is trying to lead an adult life.<br /><br />Gideon isn't a saint.  He uses sex to get Eva to admit to hurt feelings and punishing him.  Despite that, you can sense Gideon's struggle with the depth of his feelings for Eva and just how he's supposed to express that when Eva finds those three little words so important.  Actions speak louder than words (which I think Eva finally gets at the end) but for two people how constantly need validation from each other you can see how hard it is for Gideon.<br /><br />There are a some ups and a lot of downs with this story.  Gideon and Eva run the gamut of emotions and those filter off of the page to the reader.  But for all their issues, this is a couple that I'm committed to seeing to their HEA.  For that, I must wait for the last installment, Entwined with You, due out at the end of the year.<br /><br />Review copy received from Publisher, via Edelweiss.ut of emotions and those filter off of the page to the reader.

B004GBIE3Y|2.0|This movie needed a little more to it.  It seemed like it was going to become really interesting throughout the movie but just kind of stays in the same place.  Would not recomend it.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|I liked the scope of this book - modern implications of a medieval cleric's search for ancient manuscripts, and the impact of one in particular. Well written and paced, fascinating material.

B007ZI06FE|5.0|I was soooo leary about trying this book. Steampunk? What kind of genre is that? But the reviews sucked me in and boy am I glad they did. I am going to add this author to my \\"preorder and count the days until release\\" list. Honoria is an honorable, hard working, strong character! She gives up so much to support her brother and sister. And Blade!!!! What a strong, dedicated, honorable man! Bec McMaster is a fantastic writer. For this price, you would be crazy NOT to try it. Please, support McMaster so that we can continue to enjoy her books!!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I read this book many years ago while I was in West Germany, I enjoyed it then as well as now.<br />I have appreciated all of James Clavell books Tai-Pan, Noble House, Gai-Jin, and King Rat.<br />However, Shogun is at the top of the list, superbly crafted and surging with action.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 books and don't know that I could rate this one better than the others.  Each played an important role in building the story line to the finale.  I was able to be whisked away into the plot and for me that is what a good story should do.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Have read everything Lee Child has written and this ranks right up there. Love the way he writes. Short, to-the-point, action packed sentences that contain so much, say so much. Can't wait for the next installment in the life of this fascinating character.
B0098VXE50|3.0|Not one I'd choose to see again. Poor dialogue with weak and obvious special effects telling the story in a way that seems formulaic.

There are more characters an it's not as exciting. This book is more of a relation type story. I have read all the percy Jackson books an this i s the most boring Percy Jackson book in my opinion. I say this in respect of the author. It's not a bad book at all in general. it is just not the book for those who are seeking action.<br />-I HOPE THIS WAS HELPFUL- :)
0812993292|5.0|An unexpected gem. At once moving, charming, inspiring, sad, funny - it made me want to pull on a pair of boat shoes and hit the road to cleanse my head of past troubles and emotional demons. I fell in love with the characters, and was caught completely off guard by the final chapters. Not what I expected at all.

0345803485|4.0|James is a very fine writer. This book is enjoyable to read.  The S&M is not over the top. I admired the heroine for her courage in the book.
B0098VXE50|2.0|On the up side, the special effects were great.  Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth gave good performances, though Hemsworth was pushed into the background pretty quickly.<br /><br />On the down side, Kristen Stewart got a lot of screen time.  This wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that she can't act her way out of a wet paper bag.  She has no emotion and is totally unconvincing.  Also, the writing was a little iffy.  It wasn't terrible, but it was obvious that the screenplay did not live up to the director's aspirations.<br /><br />My expectations for this film were not that high to begin with, but it still failed to reach them.  If I had it to do over, I'd save my money and wait for this to come to Netflix or Amazon Prime for free.
B00699XMCO|5.0|This is one of the few things from childhood that has stood up over time. It is as cute and funny as it was when I was a little girl. I look forward to sharing it with my own daughter when she is old enough to enjoy it.

I had forgotten how good these books are.<br />Starting with the first book, Killing Floor, again I must say tha Lee Child never fails to deliver an exciting story.  I am now to Reacher book 5 and still going.<br />Killing Floor was an edge of your seat thriller with Reacher the way we like him.  Tuff, fair and READY.  Don't miss it.
0345803485|1.0|I would give it less than one star if I could. Was this book seriously written by an adult woman? I will never understand the mass following of this book, or the author.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|Since Matthew Belamy fell head over heels for Kate Hudson, Muse has lost it's edge.Matthew doesn't even sing every song. I love this group, But this album is not great. I have a feeling this will be the last Muse album. My experience tells me that love and a baby(with Kate), letting the other band members sing the songs will be the end of Muse. As far as the album itself goes, I like :Follow Me, Animals, Explorers, Big Freeze, Save Me. Liquid State is interesting, and with some editing<br />by me, both of The 2nd Law songs aren't terrible. I don't get the First five songs on the album at all.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|I know there has been some criticism of this film, that it was too childish, boring, silly or ridiculous!  Everyone ofcourse is entitled to their opinion.  Having said that, I think the movie started off a bit slow in certain areas but eventually it did live up to the action.  Did I think it was the best film ever?  To be honest, I can't really say at this point. I thought it was alright, definitely not boring by any means!  All the super heroes did an excellent job in all respects, therefore I am giving it 5 stars.  I just didn't care for Samuel L. Jackson's role in this film, perhaps they could have chosen someone else.<br /><br />I hope you watched the credits at the end which includes some additional footage.<br /><br />As far as the bluray is concerned: 10/10 for sound and picture quality.<br /><br />****MINOR SPOILER BELOW, PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE!!****<br /><br />In my opinion, it was Iron Man that actually saved the day in the end.  The other super heroes played their part well, but Iron Man put a stop to all the violence by taking the missile to the mothership.

His father is an assistant district attorney; his mother is a teacher.  As sometimes happens when parents have high-profile jobs and/or hectic lives, they become a bit disconnected from their son and their world is pulled out from beneath them when Jacob is accused of the murder of one of his classmates.<br />The story is told from Jacob's father's point of view with court transcripts sometimes providing the narrative.<br />While not the BEST book I've read, it did keep me engrossed and I did want to return to it to see how it all played out.

It's hard to review without giving something away to those who have not yet read it.<br />But I think of it as having 2 parts completely different from each other as far as what you know, or think you know, about the 2 main characters.  That part was very interesting and unique.<br />What still has me thinking is the ending...<br />Is the ending satisfying??  Is it surprising??  Could it have ended another way??<br />Hmmmm...
B008J34466|5.0|the cd is really good  you can play  it all the way through and not be disappointed. bought the cd after just hearing the one single and wasn't dissappointed compare to other artist. actually even better then her last cd funhouse, so she did progress compared to other artist where a little less than have the cd is worth listening to.
B008NW67E0|3.0|I know, everyone else seems to like this cd so I expect bad reviews upfront.  This cd is so freaking boring and uninspiring that I could barely listen to it more than once in a row.  All the tracks sound alike. There is not one track, other than the first single release, I will wait for you, worth listening to repeatedly.  Their first cd was so spectacular that I was expecting so much more than this from Mumford and Sons that I am hugely disappointed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow!!!!  This is a fantastic second book in this series.  I read Bared to You and absolutely loved it.  I was anticipating this book so much and it didn't let me down.  I have been drawn into Gideon and Eva's story and just can't wait to read more.  This is definitely a page turner...you won't want to stop once you've started!  I had been having trouble connecting with books lately, but this one was exactly what I was looking for.  If you like the first one...you'll love this one too.  If you haven't read the first, read that first and then this.  You will love it!
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse is a group that requires multiple listenings to appreciate how brilliant they.  The cd is no exception. There is some experimenting with new sounds but they remain true to their sound throughout.  As a huge fan, I however,am not all that fond of the last two tracks on the cd. Nor do I really like panic station.
B001N8V7KA|3.0|As a kid I remember there being more action and more Airplane dogfighting. The movie is about 40 minutes too long but still enjoyable.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved how easy it was to relate to the characters and what they were going through.  It is so much easier to understand significant historical events when the characters are involved and they pull you into the event.  I can't wait for the third book to come out.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|Was unsure about this based on quality reviews here but I just don't have the room to Kinect at this house.  I was making due but since Amazon has an awesome return policy, I hit it.  Turns out, it works GREAT!  I can now do my workouts in Your Fitness Evolved (original) without hitting my sofa.  Also played Just Dance 3 with my wife without having to be on top of her (not that I'd not want to be...)<br /><br />We have our kinect on top of the TV at about 5' and it works fairly well there with the Zoom.  I may try to move the kinect back down below the TV as suggested but for now, it works fine.<br /><br />So long story short, it works well for me.  Sold by Amazon, you have nothing to lose if it doesn't work!

B0037W68F4|5.0|This is an excellent CD with an original style. If you like \\"Oracular Spectacular,\\" you might find this to be a slight departure. I really enjoy the musical direction MGMT are exploring here. The songs sound like a mixture of the Beach Boys, the Doors, Lush, and 1970s AM radio. The standout track is the over 12-minute long \\"Siberian Breaks.\\" It is too bad that weren't any big hits from this release, but it is fabulous nonetheless.

B000QRIGJY|5.0|I enjoy the Bosch series by Michhael Connelly and this one didn't disappoint me. I only wish I could have read this series in order.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|A friend told me to read this book and it was SO GOOD! I have recommended it to 5 people now, it is such a cute romantic book. But not too x rated. It is good for both adults and young adults to read and I HIGHLY suggest both to read it!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher!  Always gets it done!  In todays crazy politially corrrect world, Reacher is so refreshing.  Lee Childs has done it again!  An excellent read!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Just finished The Casual Vacancy - an absolutely stunning book. This is J.K. Rowling as William Faulkner - introducing tons of characters, then letting them stew in a stuffy, self-important, backwater town. There's a theater cliche that if you put a gun over the mantlepiece in the first act, someone'd better fire it by the end of the second. In the final 40 pages, Rowling unleashes a fusillade - tying together all elements of her soap opera into a gut-wrenching ending that manages to be both inspiring and an indictment at the same time. Well worth reading.
B000W21HB2|5.0|Southern Rock Gods.  Buy their other too.  We miss you Duane (not so much Greg & Cher)! 18, 19, 20.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|An intriguing and beautifully crafted tale set in the Victorian era of seance, science and expanding ideas about the world. The two key protagonists are bound to each other in a contest framed in a wonderfully conceived night circus that has a touch of whimsy mixed in with a sophisticated taste and style. No cheesy magicians here! The magic is presented as being hidden in plain view. The superficial and slightly hysterical romance - although perfectly correct for genre and period - is the reason I chose 4 instead of 5 stars. Highly recommended.
B005J2V74C|4.0|This and the sequel are clever and interesting take on the found footage phenomena while poking fun at the ghost chasers cable shows, most definitely worth your time.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS.  A 6TH GRADER COULD HAVE FIGURED THIS OUT FROM THE NEWSPAPERS.<br /><br />NO BIG SECRETS HERE.<br />MM
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so suprised with the ending of this book when gale says  well u know what i shouldnt tell u the ending cuz then theres no point in reading the book so if u want to know the ending then read the book but its very suprising
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I absolutely love this game and was so excited when I saw it on here. I had it on my old smartphone but when I went back to a plain phone and got this it was not available. So I am one very satisfied customer! Now if they would get the other versions of the coin dozer game...there is coin dozer seasons and halloween coin dozed and thanksgiving coin dozed. There is also one called cookie dozer that I would like to see become available. Enjoy this game!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|When I think of how poorly these were written...and how repetitive they were...and how nauseating at times they became...and how shallow the characters were...I wonder how she sold a gazillion copies of them all.  Pardon me while I order the third one.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this, I liked the characters and really felt connected to them! I can't wait to read the next book in this series.
B00881VLCE|4.0|You can't loose a puzzle piece and you can take the puzzles with you. Enjoy putting these together in different sizes.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Still trying to get three stars Been only gettIng mostly two. The content Is great the boards are colorful It Is a joy to play on the traIn to work
B007SNMYNS|5.0|This book is amazing, and eye-opening for sure! Even if you don't want to completely give up wheat, there is so much good information in it--important information. If you are a healthy eater, or if you want to be a healthy eater, this book is a must-read.
0316228532|4.0|I had a hard time getting into this book. Yes the language can be crass and there are uncomfortable moments. At times I thought, why am I reading this? But then I realized I was having a hard time getting the story out of my head. It still makes you think long after you finish. Are the characters likeable?  No. But society has so many people like this. JK Rowling really surprised me with how deeply this story has stuck with me.<br />No it's not Harry Potter, so if that's what you want, you will hate it. If you want something that will make you think, read this book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is very reliable. I am only 9 and whenever I need to know how much battery I have left I look at this app!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love it but it is glitchy but i still like it!!!I am only on level 38 it is fun and amazingly cool
B0051BNRTO|1.0|I read this book because of its high reviews but it was not what I was expecting. It was boring and strange, the writer lacked any descriptive skills and the characters were highly annoying. I don't know what age group he was targeting but I can not recommend anyone to read this, I read to the end only to see if it got any better which it didn't. I actually threw out this book when I was done because I don't want to inflict such stupidity to others. I would not normally write such a negative review but this is definitely the worst book I have ever read.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|All of the Harry Hole books are outstanding. This book did not disappoint. Again, the plot moves along without the usual needless fill. Although Harry stays in trouble, he always figures out who the perp is, which is always surprising. I highly recommend you read Harry Hole books in order. pat lilley, raleigh, nc
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app every time I plug in my kindle fire it pops right up and it lets me know if my kindle over heating or not which ot never does but I love it totally worth getting on anything.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I am an avid Reacher fan who has read each one of Child's books.  While certainly worth reading, this was one of my least favorite.  My impression was Lee Child sort of \\"phoned this one in\\" and I didn't feel as captured by the story as I usually am with his books.
B0060D16VI|5.0|fantastic picture and the movie was super funny my kids were very happy with it and so were the adults. so convenient.
B008B11RLQ|4.0|I bought this recently and was very excited to get it and have all those original albums as they were released in Elvis's lifetime. Let me start out with the positive. The sound quality is excellent as are the bonus tracks. The sound is warm and has good bass response without sounding muddy. Without the bonus tracks, most of these discs wouldn't last much longer than 30-35 minutes. And who doesn't want more Elvis? The CDs are packed in nice thick cardboard replicas of the original LPs. The booklet has a description of each album and then track listings for each.<br /><br />Well, now for the things that could better. As I said above, I wanted original albums with songs in the original sequence. The problem is that many of the discs have songs in an order that differs from the order listed on the backs of the mini LP sleeves. Why? Also, the bonus tracks are sometimes interspersed with original album tracks. Again, why? The third negative is repetition. Some songs are repeated on different CDs. For example, a few bonus tracks on Potluck also appear on the next disc after that in the set. The bonus tracks on Moody Blue are, in fact, the entirety of From Elvis Presley Blvd, which is included in this set as a separate CD. Lastly, the Welcome to My World CD was originally a country-themed budget compilation album that has songs from all the other CDs. Why include it? I would trade that waste of a CD (at least it's a waste in the context of this box set) for Back in Memphis in a heartbeat. Or one of his more popular soundtrack albums like Blue Hawaii or GI Blues.<br /><br />Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives. I am very happy with this purchase and would do it again. For Elvis fans who have only themed compilation CDs or just a few original albums, there is a lot to discover and explore here. Some of the early-mid 70s albums would be very hard to find otherwise, I think. Just know that a lot of these CDs aren't the original albums in original song order and that there is some repetition of tracks.<br /><br />I give it 4.5 stars with the 1/2-star deduction for the resequencing of original-album songs with bonus tracks. The inclusion of the redundant Welcome to My World CD sort of bugs me, too. I wasn't trying to be negative about this set - just thought potential buyers would want to know this up front. I think Sony put together all the latest single-disc releases into this set, so the albums weren't compiled exclusively for this set, which explains the song overlap, in my opinion. It is still a great set with a lot to offer.
B007SGM084|4.0|The trilogy was great, it had a few unexpected turn of events. You should make sure you know what kind of book this is before reading or buying, I don't think that this book series is for any young person.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Ok loving the book so far but like many of you I am receiving the annoying crashes as well. The way I fixed this is by going to table of contents as soon as your book opens from there Click on chapter 26 and as long as you don't mind missing a couple pages this will work fine. Also if it doenst work the first time try a couple more times or reset your kindle. A great book that I cant put down and now I don't have the stupid crashes.
B0011Z8SPW|5.0|This album is simply, awesome. I listen to it from beginning to end and never skip a song. I have to say that I don't own many CDs that I can listen to them and enjoy it from the first song to the very last one. Very happy.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have loved ALL of Lee Child's books and would have rated them 4 or 5 stars. This one became too detailed and repetitive.
