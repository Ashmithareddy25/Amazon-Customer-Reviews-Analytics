B0000640VO|1.0|I fell asleep when I was watching it. It's too slow and boring. Why do people highly rate this movie?
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first heard John Mayer on the \\"Serendipity\\" soundtrack with the song \\"83.\\"  Finally jumped on the wagon and bought \\"Room for Squares.\\"  Left the CD in Ohio accidentally and had to buy it again, I love it THAT much.  In my humble opinion, the Amazon.com reviewer above is a cynical snot with no sense of whimsy.  If you're a fairly well-adjusted person, this CD will be for YOU!  The first few tracks are standout amazing, but my favorite is actually \\"3 by 5.\\"  Check it out--it's just a happy, feel-good kind of CD.  Hooray for John Mayer!  Proud to have such a great singer/songwriter/all-around-great musician in my generation.
6304698526|5.0|Set in San Francisco of the late `60s, Bullitt shows what Hollywood was once capable of. In a genre that is now formula, special effects and graphic violence, this film uses a good script, great acting and fine directing to accomplish a story that still manages to entertain. One of the first of a long line of cops versus politicians and crime movies it's still one of the best.<br />McQueen struggles with both the criminals and the bureaucracy in his search for the killers of one of his fellow cops. The plot itself is fairly simple with the secret to the films quality being the atmosphere, honest situations such as the surgery scene and great action sprinkled throughout. Special mention should be made of the realism of many of the scenes and the use of San Francisco as location for the film.<br />Of course Bullitt contains one of the great car chase sequences in modern film. Without the use of special effects or expensive tricks, the scene is complicated and simple. Steve McQueen did much of the driving himself, while the hills of San Francisco contribute to the action.<br />The excellent cast includes Steve McQueen, Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Vaughn. This is probably Peter Yates, who directed The Dresser and Eyewitness, best work. Also look for a brief appearance of Robert Duvall as a taxi driver. Highly recommended.
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore narrates this history as only a master can do. Every little detail is perfectly planned, and all conducts inevitably to a so surprising and shocking ending that will leave you without breath.<br />Critic and readers can't be mistaken. This is possibly the best comic-book ever.
B000000H6D|5.0|Bloody Kisses, the title alone is enough to get Tipper Gore's panties in a bunch, The music is incredible, and so different from all the other goth bands out there. with slow and yet still somehow rocking rythms they take metal to new highs or is it lows. in my opinion, this album is where the band was the tighest and the music was the most powerful and who can forget the the cover of seals and crofts summer breeze, so if you are looking for something other than the usual check this album out, you'll be glad that you did!
B0000025DT|5.0|Why do record execs insist on shelving the true masters of music in favor of so called music and musicians.This is the kind of album that will still be played for decades and this is the kind of music that VH1 should be showcasing.Everything about this record is so classic, much like Beethoven and Bach of the classical music world.This one definitely needs the remastering with lyrics,liner notes,photos and bonus material.It's always cool to get a little insight about the songs from Jeff.I'd say this is their most classic album based on the material and an excellent place to start.
B00006F7S4|5.0|For those of you who are used to the crazy collaboration of sounds, backed by misc. words that are so detached that they start to make sense, you have only hit the tip of an enormous iceberg that is Beck.  I am not claiming that I know what the man is and what he thinks, but an album like Sea Change gives the listener a rare glimpse into the man, not manchild, behind the pink pants, shaggy hair, and rosy complexion.  Sea change is mellow in sound and in feel.  The exciting sounds of machinery and funky beats are replaced by stripped vocals, acoustic guitars, and eerie echoing calls.  It is melancholy and full of heartache, as Lost Cause demonstrates hitting a painfully familiar note with any listener who has ever loved, or tried to.  It is not party in your pants, let's go bowl for kiwi dip.  Beck is finally throwing at the public that he is human, not cyborg and that he too can be scathed by the flames like everyone else.  Beck puts his soul on the table, and after just a taste you'll want to give the guy a hug.
B0000025DR|5.0|This is a great place to start with ELO.This one is more guitar oriented and rocks a little harder.Strange Magic and Evil Woman have always been classics but Poker and Fire on High seem to get overlooked on compilations and on classic rock radio.There are always comparisons between ELO and the Beatles and I feel this stands along anything that the Beatles came out with.Lots of people don't want to admit that other songwriters can write outstanding music but I feel Jeff is one of them.My only complaint is that Sony won't release the remasters for Face the Music,A New World Record and Out of the Blue.
0385486804|4.0|Krakauer does a fine job examining McCandless's journey into Alaska, and in exploring the psychological reason's for his doing so.  This book is well worth the read.  It is true human drama - sadness, humor, and, in the final outcome, the inability to understand what motivates people.  It's an easy read.  Enjoy.
B00005KHEU|5.0|I was listening to Kasey Casem top 40 flashback and he mentioned that Fleetwood Mac and Huey Lewis were the only groups up to that time to have 4 top 10's by a group on one album.Actually this album had four top tens on the Uk chart.I guess he was referring to the US Billboard charts.I really like this album.the covers cool,the production isn't as layered and the tunes show a great craftsman at work.The big one is Don't Bring Me Down,but Confusion,Shine a Little Love and Last Train are equally as good.I thought the On the Run demo had potential as a completely different version to be released in full.Jeff really like the 50's style music and he sounds great doing the Del Shannon tune.I wouldn't mind an album like this from Jeff.I put this in my top 5 ELO's.
B0000542D2|3.0|The stars are for the movie. Love the movie. As for release as a DVD?...1 star only. You Can't Do That has been available for quite some time and should have been included here as part of a definitive release.  It is supposed to be a collectors edition after all.  The failure of Miramax to include that is upsetting. Picture is fine, except some flashes and marks here and there. Could have been cleaned up a bit. But the sound...a mono mix probably would have been better.  The sound is as bad as you remember.  Perhaps, that is the best they could do.  If so, so be it.  If not, I should ask for my money back.
B000002BMV|5.0|I remember this in highschool.It was the perfect time for this to be released.So much corporate rock was released at this time.Some people think corporate rock means selling out.If a record company backs a record it's corporate.Everything you hear is corporate.Industry is all about money and it used to include quality.This is some of industrys best right here.All the songs have great vocals,great melodies and cool riffs.The production is really great here,unlike all their other releases.I still crank Don't Stop Believin'and Stone in Love when I here them.This and Infinity are where to start your Journey collection.
B000002IST|5.0|I can't believe the appalling reviews that this AMAZING CD has been getting. What is wrong with you ppl. We Can't Dance I must admit is their strongest and most creative album since Trick Of The Tail. True Invisible Touch was a very poppish album but it was and still is a very intelligent album. The follow-up to me, surpasses it and is one of my favorites from Genesis. True, a couple of tracks especially &quot;Hold On My Heart&quot; belong on one of Collins' solo projects but come on ppl, give this CD a chance! Driving The Last Spike and Fading Lights are among the most prog-rock like tracks they've done since Wind &amp; Wuthering. Even the more mainstream tracks are creative and intelligent. <br />Don't get me wrong, I love the Peter Gabriel era works especially &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; but purists need to keep their mouths shut! Don't listen to the negative press about this album, just go out and buy it! Believe me, you'll not be dissapointed at all. Just go and buy all of Genesis' CDs. Start with Invisible Touch first, then We Can't Dance, and go from there. BTW don't forget about Calling All Stations. WHOA! Genesis truly are among the best bands of all time.
B0000025C0|5.0|I find that the sound on here is so fantastic and better thatn the debut.I'm not saying the songs are better,just the production of the material.This is one is equal to the debut in many ways and would have been an awesome double lp as Tom had intended for it to be.Record execs pushed too hard for a quick release and this what they had.All classics once again.
B00006I9HJ|5.0|After their release of the Proximity Effect CD in the USA which was a big success, Nada Surf has released this album, their 4th more-or-less full-length effort.  The bonus tracks are good, and worth the extra dough.  This is your best bet unless you want to wait until January 2003 (noooooooooooooooooooooooo!) for the USA release of this album.
B000002O51|5.0|One thing thats true about this album is its production.This one does sound more mechanical and not as laid backfeeling as \\"Don't Look Back\\" but the quality of the sound allows you to hear every detail as it was intended.Lots of albums hide whats going on because they really suck and don't want you know that there is no quality.The first four songs alone make it five stars.These are great for cranking or for guitarists who want songs to play that really rock.Love the harmonies and especially that Rockman sound.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I gave this disc a listen after hearing that Beck wrote it after breaking up with his girlfriend. I have this theory that whenever an artist records an album after a break-up, it's usually pretty good. There's usually a plaintative honesty that only a love gone sour can spark... Examples that come to mind are New Order's &quot;Technique&quot;, The Foo Fighters' &quot;There is Nothing Left to Lose&quot;, and The Beatles' &quot;Let It Be&quot;.<br />As suspected, &quot;Sea Change&quot; is a brilliant album. It's affecting in that with every song, you can feel Beck's pain. He doesn't feel like getting funky; he just wants to sort his emotions out. This is a pretty darn near perfect album...
B000002572|5.0|Everything on here is pure classic.Hearing something so many times tends to distort views about music because you sometimes tire of it.This is a true rock classic,no filler.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|So much high praise has already been lavished on this album that it hardly needs one more ecstatic review. But every time I listen to \\"Brave New World\\", it seems, I can't help sharing my admiration of Maiden's magic.<br /> \\"Brave New World\\" stands out as possibly the most maturely sounding album of the group. In a way, this is slightly disappointing, because one no longer feels in every composition a youthful springiness and mischivousness of \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\", \\"The Duelists\\" or \\"Be Quick or Be Dead\\". Maybe only \\"The Wicker Man\\" from \\"Brave New World\\" shows the same spirit.<br /> But other compositions! What a mastery of style! What technique! What a faithfulness to the traditions of English rock music!<br /> The new compositions came out with more complicated structure, more solid overall appearance, with amazing powerful rhythms which now prevail as lead guitars in \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" or bass guitars in \\"Powerslave\\" did.<br /> Among the tracks from \\"Brave New World\\", \\"The Nomad\\", perhaps, is the best. The excellent coordination of vocals, guitars and drums weave the spidery web of Oriental essence, gently entangling the listener in mystery and perfection.
B0000025DV|5.0|This is Jeff's most layered album.He is so cool at coming up with bits of material to start songs or spice them up.The more songs there are on the album,the more there is to not like about one or two songs.I've got all the albums and Jeff has always come up with material that was really out there.That's what makes ELO so unique and some people don't get it.The Beatles came up with exotic and strange oddities all the time and no one complained;it was just called classic Beatles.At least Jeff does it without the use of intoxicants.Turn to Stone,Sweet Talkin' and Mr. Blue Sky will always be favs, but don't overlook the rain medley or Wild West Hero or Birmingham Blues.The only one I didn't care for was Believe Me Now.Get this one for your collection.
0316666343|5.0|I read a ton of books and it seems like there has been nothing interesting out for months, not even over the summer, but this one I picked up and it hooked me right from the start.  I liked the way the story was told. We seem to have a real need to know what happens to us following death and this book had a interesting look at death and the afterlife's influence on the way life continues back on earth.  I like the way the main character continued to mature even after her death and how she cared for those left behind. I'm sure hollywood will snatch this one up.
B00005OATM|5.0|This is an interesting production in many ways. Much of the sets will give the audience a surprise. The only disappointing part is the dragon, which is under-whelming. The Siegfried is performed by Mandred Jung, who is quite an active stage performer even though his voice is not of the first class. Heinz Zednik is an excellent Mime. The Brunnhilde is sung by Gwyneth Jones, who produces a few squally notes but the part is passionately sung nevertheless.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This is Beck, on a completely different note.  He's serious this time around, and he's concocted a near masterpiece.  Beck sort of lost me around &quot;Odelay&quot;.  I was getting burnt out on his goofiness.  Each folk-like song on this album is very melodic and powerfully depressing, unlike anything he's ever written.  You may not enjoy it the first time around, and you will certainly need to mellow out in preparation for a listen.  However,within a few spins the tunes will become memorable and you will find yourself humming along.
6304211740|5.0|This was an amazing movie.  William Hurt was perfectly brooding and handsome.  Watch it with an open mind, for the version it is.  The emotions are played to subtle perfection.  If you are looking for a silly and overplayed soap opera, watch General Hospital.
0151008116|5.0|I just finished Story of Pi and am now pondering how many of my friends might enjoy the recommendation.  Honestly, I think they will all be fascinated by the account of a boy, a castaway from a devestating shipwreck, surviving 227 days on a small life boat with a tiger.  Told as if it is a biography, Life of Pi is both gripping and powerful with profound philosophical implications.  Yet, it is not written as an allegory.  As a reader, you easily accept the premise that this boy, Pi, has only a tiger as a companion and so must balance his life on the reft between surviving the elements and surviving the tiger.<br />This book has been nominated here in the UK for the Booker Prize (the biggest prize for fiction in the UK) and deserves every accolade.  The philosophy and biology is so beautifully well done that you don't even realize you have been instructed.  Highly recommended.
006016848X|4.0|I'll admit that I was skeptical with all of the furor over this book, however I believe it does provide valid insights into the male/female differences in outlook.  We DO think and act differently and at times when our beloved's behavior is most confusing it really does help to have someone actually address the problem with an insight we would never have considered.  I think John Gray is a little bit too warm-and-fuzzy for a lot of men but he makes a number of valid observations that I found to be valuable not only with my spouse but also dealing with men in business.  It is not the ONLY relationship tool you will need but it can offer explanations for behaviors that seem unpredictable and unfathomable to women, simply because they are so different for our own behavior.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|This is the best movie that I have seen with Ben Stiller and I love that he directed it as well. There aren't many movies that talk about male modeling, in fact I can't think of any others. I want to give credit to both Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, they made great models, each playing them dumb but still loveable. They are a great many moments that I could talk about, the award show, the miner montage, and the fashion show, but my favorite part of the film in the gas fight with Derick's male model roomates. Also I need to give A LOT of credit to Will Ferrell, Mugatu was GREAT to say the least. I don't think there is a person out there that can play a comic bad guy better than he can. The only performance that I did not love was that of Christine Taylor, Ben's wife. She doesn't seem to care for any of the other people in the film and she just seems to be reading her lines. But everyone else more than makes up for her. <BR>This film is not one to pick if you put thought into your movies. But if you enjoy escaping into a world of make believe then this is the right one for you. After a stressful week this is the movie that I watch to relax and laugh with. I know that it will do the same for you.
0786889284|3.0|Sgt. Boldt plunges right into a frightening case full of the fear of fatally frying in fire, friends and foes alike. &quot;Overwrought&quot; for a Pearson novel, that is (Sgt. Boldt is immediately panicked by a nasty arson case but his reaction hardly seems initially [or finally] justifiable on the evidence presented). The story still doesn't hold a candle to the recent excesses of  psycho-mystery writers Cornwall or Patterson. While Boldt and his devoted  police psychologist Daphne Matthews are fully rounded characters, here they surely do have more than their fair share of personal problems, marriages threatening to break up amid other disasters of child abuse, disappearence, and psychic mummery. Several times you think Boldt has found his man, but then Pearson adds another jolting twist and the chase resumes. At times it is truly intense and thrilling.<br />The plot has a parallel story structure, but we see not the criminal, who is very well hidden, but a poor boy dreadfully afraid to leave his extraordinarily abusive father. Pearson has a wonderful ability to make a small observation-like a cleaned window-develop into bone-chilling significance. There are many fine moments here despite a story that starts too fast and ends too tamely.
B00005K9QP|5.0|If you are a fan of early Clapton (and I am) then this is a must buy album. It is also true that his Strat tone is very different with the Les Paul Marshall set up.  However, I am not sure this was the big blues break-through album everyone talks about. It was one of the first white blues albums delivered to the sixties  rock audience. And its was delivered by a sixties super group guitar god. It was good music. But there are plenty of other great blues musicians who played Gibsons. There was only one, however, who went on to play in a rock super group. <br />Having said all the above, I can confirm that I learned many of my early licks dissecting slow hands on the turntable.
B00006IX0R|4.0|Fame is fleeting as The Cranberries would know. After the release of Faithful Deaprted, their stars began to dim and their popularity has since dwindled to a low. The US has been a traditioanlly good market but no more.<br /><br />Notheless, here is a collection that begins with the dreamy songs such as Linger and Dreams that capulated the band to immediate fame. Next comes No Need To Argue which spins off a few classics form the berries. Faithful Deaperted saw the band taking a more serious front which did alienate a few friends. While the band was on the verge of a disarray, they took a long 3 year to come up with the effervescent Bury The Hatchet but 3 years was too long to be away. Last year's Coffee offering was a disappointment beyond Analyze. the rest of the album saw a filler of sorts and rehash of past discarded material.<br /><br />Even so, this collections erves as one of the best ways to recollect the Cranbeeries moment.
0971855110|5.0|This book & e-mail system has litterally changed my life for the better in everyway imaginable. It took me some time, lots of time for that matter to PUT the program in motion. However now that I am doing MY part and following the routines & zone work, it is miraculous what it has done for me & my family.<br /><br />I have 3 children, ages 11, 10, 9, and a house full of furry critters. To say that my house gets filthy, and filthy in a hurry, is the understatement of the year! I have always loved the thought of the system that the FlyLady has free on her website, and the Testimonials that arrive in my box daily have always been so uplifting.<br /><br />However, because of my perfectionism, and not ever starting because I felt that if I didn't have the time to finish a job, why start, Big Mistake. Finally about 3 1/2 months ago I re-read the book and started the Baby Steps on the website, and I cannot express how much relief I feel now. And it is not something that will just last a few days, or a few weeks, I am going on having a comfy and cozy home for 4 months now, WOW!<br /><br />My house has been in shambles for YEARS now. I always made a good start at different systems, I have a full bookcase of tons of so-called organization books, but I would always crash and burn. Not anymore. I have finally learned to love myself, and forgive myself for the past. FlyLady tells us in each e-mail, You are not behind, jump in where you are. And now she also includes, Progress Not Perfection in 2007. That is exactly what I needed! I know longer let my perfectionism stop me in my tracks. I set my Timer for 15 minutes and do the work, and stop when the Timer stops. Then I move on to my next task, restart the Timer for another 15 minutes, and do the same with that task. After every (3) 15 minutes of work, I get a 15 Minute break for ME!!!<br /><br />I always thought to myself, having and keeping a clean house would take up every minute of my time and my life. NOT TRUE at all!!! It is the exact opposite. I no longer have to feel bad for taking breaks when the house is in CHAOS, I even find that I have lots and lots of more free time. And I never have to worry where to start or what should I do now. I have a plan, and it gets done. I no longer have to-do lists a foot long that get carried over to the tommorow's to-do list.<br /><br />And because of the peace that I have created in my \\"Home\\", and in myself, my family spends weekends doing family time. We have Family Meetings every Saturday, we play board games, rent movies, read together. And now, finally, we are now looking for a church that we can attend regularly. We moved a few years back and haven't found a church yet. We always put off looking for one because, 1. Never any clean clothes. 2. The house always had to be tackled by the whole family on weekends. 3. We didn't feel like it because of the Chaos that our house created. 4. We were ashamed to meet anyone there and bring them to our house. The list could go on and on.<br /><br />Now, there is always fresh, clean clothes ready to go when we are.<br />There is order in our home. We feel like a tighter family. The kids have routines that they keep themselves and feel proud of. We have family dinner at the table, and my meals are always planned, and shopping is a breeze, and I always have what I need on hand for my menus. I no longer feel that my work is unapreciated and neverending, or unnoticed. My family is so greatful for the peace that I have created in our new \\"home\\".<br />I have found so much peace in her system, I am currently reading her newest book \\"Body Clutter\\" , a New York Times Best Seller. And just as suspected, she has out did herself again. I reccomend it also, it is not a Diet Book. It is a book about releasing the Body Clutter between your ears. You can get it here on Amazon at a great price, read it's reviews too!<br /><br />Please, if you are overwhelemed with the order of your house, and it doesn't feel like a home. BUY THE BOOK! [...].<br /><br />But most importantly, remember it is Baby Steps. Don't do to much at one time. Build your routines one baby step at a time. Add don't go to the new steps until the previous step is in place. And always remember that You are not behind, jump in where you are. Progress, not Perfection in 2007!<br /><br />Thank you FlyLady, from the bottom of my heart! :*<br />Good luck and God Bless!aby Steps. Don't do to much at one time. Build your routines one baby step at a time. Add don't go to the new steps until the previous step is in place. And always remember that You are not behind, jump in where you are.

0553573403|5.0|In the tradition of \\"Mists of Avalon,\\" Martin's series of books really propel the reader with exquisite character development, intelligent style, and the ability to hold the reader's \\"suspension of disbelief\\" so well that I have started to use vocabulary only found in Martin's imagination in everyday life!<br />The story of several warring nobles houses is compelling due to its sense that no one house is just.  Each family has a certain amount of good and evil, and because of that, relating to them is not so difficult.  I often find that in reading books about the fall of nobility (think \\"Gone with The Wind\\"), I have trouble identifying with the characters, but in Martin's novel, I certainly do not.<br />I highly recommend this book and hope you found this insight helpful.
B0000013GT|5.0|Sure outkasts 1st CD was good, yeah aquimeni was awesome, uh-uh their greatest hits CD is out, Stankonia? That was no good, but wait!<BR>This is the deepest most profound hip-hop CD EVER.<BR>Outkast becomes deep and soulful unlike todays,\\"Commerical Rap\\".<BR>Outkast plays mellow beats as their words smoothly flow through the song. They rap about deep philosophical things, like how the world is sad, and on what could very well be the greatest song I've ever heard,\\"Growing Old\\", Big Boi and Andre play a piano with some techno music and a sultry women's voice. Oh my god, it is so amazing and thoughtful. Outkast may be becoming more commerical these days, but this is from when they really were just, \\"Two Dope Boys In a Cadillac\\". Even if you despise rap at least listen to \\"Wheelez of Steel\\", or,\\"Jazzy Bell\\".<BR>You won't regret it. To sum this review up: Outkast has made a masterpiece that you will never forget. After listening to, \\"Growing Old\\", you will never think the same of rap again...and thats good.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Pixar's Monsters, Inc. is a clever parity about a world where monsters live; their personal lives, their professional live and, more importantly, what they are afraid of...human kids!  This is a laugh out-loud tearjerker the whole family will love.  The story establishes a relationship between a human girl and monsters.  This relationship teaches us that preconceived notions can be false, and ends with a great message...humor and laughter are more powerful than fear!<br />My three-year-old daughter, husband and I love this movie, and we have only watched  it, at my daughter's request, a half-million times or so, and counting!  I highly recommend this movie!
0316666343|2.0|I started out really liking this book and would have actually recommended it.  But, then I started reading the last quarter of the book.  What a cop out to end the book the way she did.  A first grader could have seen it coming...which makes it all the worse in my opinion.  The very ending with Mr. Harvey was the worst of it in my opinion.  What had been a very well written book turned to a wrap up of the book that was meant to make the reader feel better about what had happened.
B000002MUN|3.0|Tom Petty parted with his Heartbreakes and Jeff Lynne, and released this solo-album. It received very different critics, some loved it, some thought it was rather uninteresting. I will say that this album is okay, with some very nice songs. But for the majority, the album is a bit to boring, and the songs just dont have what it takes. The sound is a bit to accoustic for me, it does not have the rich, sound of The Heartbreakers. It also lacks the energy and enjoyable sound of Lynne`s production, and this album surely shows a loss of him. But Tom Petty is known for his will to be different, and to do what he sees fit. Neverthless, this is NOT a bad album.<br />It starts of with Wildflowers, a beautiful song. Then &quot;You don`t know how it feels&quot; bursts of, but this a bit boring, so on to the next song &quot;Time to move on&quot;, which is a wonderful song with a great song. On to song 5, &quot;It`s good to be king&quot; one of my favorite songs on this record. Sweet sound.<br />The CD hits a pretty low road from there, with rather uninteresting songs all the way up to &quot;Crawling back to you&quot;, which is one of Petty`s best songs. It is the shining gem of this rough stone, and proves that Petty still know how to write songs with a rich musical sound. After all I was pretty disappointed with this album after listening to Full Moon Fever and Into the great wide open. However, the cd is not bad, and the unusual &quot;Pure&quot; sound may attract many people. But This time Tom Petty failed to attract my attention, except for some songs that I really love.<br />If you find this record for sale, buy it. I recommend it.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This film is great, however, I have one complaint, on the back of the package, there is a picture of Stephanie beecham in a scene from Dracula AD 1972. Will someone please explain to me why it is there? The same thing with the curse of frankenstein dvd, there is a scene on the back of the package from &quot;The Mummy&quot;. How can wb make this mistake? Any thoughts?
B00006FDCD|4.0|This movie scared the wits out of me when I was little and still does. This movie features a horrendous clown that terrorizes children then eats them. Six friends from 1960 regroup in 1990 to face the evil once and for all. No spoilers here, grab a bucket of popcorn flip on the DVD player and enjoy this.
0671027573|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it had every emotion in it that to me requires a good thriller. Suspense, surprise, sassiness and knock out surprise killer that thru me for a loop. Jaine and Sam were fantastic together and the secondary characters were also fantastic, I enjoyed all of the people in this book. I am so glad that Jaine and Sam were going to be together and also I's so pleased that Linda let us know why the killer became  the they, and in a way understand why they were forced to do what they did. If you are looking for a real thriller read this book. This will not be my last Linda Howard novel I will be reading others by her.
006109594X|1.0|Breathtaking drivel.  For the record, I found exactly one accurate depiction in the book.  It's where the head of the NSA is trying to figure out what's going on and brightens up at the thought that someone is lying.  Intelligence officers do enjoy a good plot.  They won't find it here:<br />1.  Nobody in the military (or in any other walk of life, for that matter) speaks the way the characters in this book do.<br />2.  Nobody in the military acts the way this writer describes them.<br />3.  Neither do officials of the US government.<br />4.  Neither do men and women.<br />5.  It would take the media about a nanosecond to begin hypothesizing about the possibility of the &quot;accident&quot; to be the result of an attack.  It would take the crowd of retired and former military know-it-alls just a moment longer to begin spilling classified information and spinning their own hypotheses.
B00005QZWI|5.0|In my opinion, the original motion picture soundtrack to the Lord of the Rings is the perfect musical score. The music is composed, orchestrated and conducted by Howard Shore, who in my opinion can be listed among the greatest music composers such as John Williams. Enya also contributes to this soundtrack, having composed and performed the music score for the ending credits, and performing the theme for Aragorn And Arwen. Contains 18 tracks:<br />1. The Prophecy<br />2. Concerning Hobbits - the music theme for the sequences set in the Hobbit-inhabited land of the Shire.<br />3. The Shadow of the Past - the music score that blends in with the part where the nature of the Ring is discovered.<br />4. The Treason of Isengard - One of the best scores of the soundtrack. It is the theme for the sequence in which Saruman becomes a traitor and battles with Gandalf.<br />5. The Black Rider Another great musical score. This theme is for the journey of the four Hobbit companions through the Shire and for the encountering of the Black Rider.<br />6. At the Sign of the Prancing Pony - Frodo Baggins adventures in the town of Bree at the Inn of the Prancing Pony is what this score is for.<br />7. A Knife in the Dark - The theme for the continuing journey of the hobbits in which sequence they arrive at the ruins of a temple and find themselves battling Ringwraiths.<br />8. Flight to the Ford - The Theme for the flight of Arwen and Frodo to Rivendell to escape the Black Riders.<br />9. Many Meetings - The theme for Rivendell, where the Elves abide.<br />10. The Council of Elrond - This is among the best scores in the album. The theme for the Council in Rivendell concerning the fate of the Ring. Also features Enya performing Aniron, the theme for Aragorn and Arwen.<br />11. The Ring Goes South - The theme for the sequence in which the Fellowship of the Ring sets out on their journey to Mordor.<br />12. A Journey in the Dark - The theme for Moria<br />13. The Bridge of Khazad Dum - Thetheme for the treacherous journey to the Bridge of Khazad Dum in Moria and the crossing over and escape from Moria. Another of the ones that are among the best scores on this album.<br />14. Lothlorien - The theme for Lothlorien, the woodlands of the Elves, through which the Fellowship of the Ring passes through in the film.<br />15. The Great River - The theme for the departure from Lothlorien.<br />16. Amon Hen - The theme for the encountering of the stone of Amon Hen.<br />17. The Breaking of the Fellowship - The score for the dispersion of the Fellowship of the Ring, in which only Frodo and Sam are left to continue the quest to destroy the Ring.<br />18. May it Be - The song performed by Enya. It is the score for the end credits of the film.<br />If you loved the film, buy this soundtrack. It is well worth the purchase price. For more information there is a site called  ... I eagerly anticipate the soundtrack for the next LOTR film.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|We rented the DVD of Moulin Rouge. I fell asleep during the first third, woke up, and decided to leave the room to do something more worthwhile. Grating high-pitched voices. Weird things going on that didn't make sense. <br />Maybe I should give it another chance someday, and see if I change my mind. This happens once in a while with films that I hate.
B00006J9OT|5.0|This is the one!<br />I saw Diana Krall live at Blues Alley, in DC, some four years ago when he was right on the cusp of her current popularity. She put on a great show, just her and a guitarist and bass. They played swing infectious arrangements that went on for 10-15 minutes at a time. She was really enjoying herself, the group seemed to be having a joyous time playing off each other and the audience loved her performance, too.<br />There was been a palpable sense of drudgery in her last shlocky album with the 1001 strings, &quot;Look of Love&quot;, where she sounded like she was sleepwalking. She was bored. This is what she really sounds like if you take her away from the studios and the big halls and the orchestras (except for the junk at the end).<br />My favorite here is the sassy &quot;East of the Sun&quot;.<br />I would have liked to hear the group stretch out a little more but after &quot;the Look of Love&quot; this is a welcome change - an album with Jazz and energy! And I like her Nat King Cole style piano.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Saw the show...couldn't wait for the CD. I can see this becoming another Rocky Horror cult-type classic. Should be popular for high school musical productions too. <br />I hope that they come out with a copy of the show on DVD to sell with the CD so I can buy them for Christmas presents. You understand the emotions behind the songs so much more if you've seen this particular Buffy show first. <br />The harmonies are wonderful...you don't want for some of the songs to end. Especially when Tara and Giles realize that they  have to leave...the harmony is beautiful yet the song is incredibly sad and all too brief. <br />If you're a Buffy Fan....this is a must have!! Even the non-Buffy fans that I've played this CD for are emotionally moved by some of the tunes and want to hear and see more.
B0000683DH|4.0|I've been a Star Trek fan since I saw the movie back when it came out in 1982,I was only a year old,but I really got into it.Like father,like daughter and like how Star Wars was to him back in 1977,that's how ST2 was to me.That scene when the Enterprise left the spacedock(which was way better in this then in the first Trek movie)was like the stardestoryer comming out of the side of the screen in Star Wars.ST2 is a sequel(or kind of)of an episode of the original series called Space Seed,with the character of Khan(played wonderfully by Ricardo Montalban)stealing the USS Reliant,to find and destory Kirk for what he did 15 years earlier.The DVD was great,the new scenes were cool and I loved the trailer which was so campy.ST2 is a very beautifully made picture which outdoes the first Trek movie.One of my favourite scenes is the first battle between the Reliant and our beloved Enterprise.I believe it was the energtic and beautiful score by James Horner,brillient characters and a great story to go with it makes ST2 The Wrath Of Khan one of the best of the Star Trek movies.All the even numbered Trek flims are the best.
B000068OCS|5.0|Koyaanisqatsi is a landmark film, a modern rejoinder to old silent cinema conceived and executed with all the subtlety of a modern technological assault. Images and sound alone convey some essence of human existence.<br />Life in the lens of Koyaanisqatsi moves in slow motion, drifting in near stasis only to quickly shift to incredibly high speeds, moments are filled with hours of images condendsed in seconds of time and strangely enough that when a scene presents itself in real time it becomes almost unreal. The velocity or stillness in the film do not become exaggerations but acquire a new dynamic of seeing and perceiving the very ordinary in an extraordinary manner.<br />Many of us have waited for the DVD with much anticipation, wondering at times if it would ever be released at all. I have mixed reactions about the DVD, not so much with the images which are brilliant and more colorful than I remember them being when the film was originally released in the theaters (which was a long time ago indeed). Images are bright clear and focused. The DVD is in Wide-Screen format but it is 4:3 Letterbox and not 16:9 ratio. Sound is the only flaw in this DVD release and a definite disappointment it is. The DVD release is in 5.1 Dolby Digital and has great presence and fidelity, however, the first 30 minutes of the soundtrack seems to be mixed away from the voices and more pronounced on the accompanying instrumentation. This is bothersome for those who have the Audio CD and are all-too-familiar with how the soundtrack should replay. Considering the important coordinate film-music dichotomy, I would have thought that greater care would have been taken in mastering the soundtrack. <br />Taken as a whole it is still a wonderful package. Images even more vibrant and beautiful than I remember. The soundtrack is mostly very good with sections that do not live up to the original theatrical soundtrack, but those sections are relatively few and should not detract from the overall greatness of one of the most original and ingenious films ever produced.<br />Also comes with an extra bonus film \\"Essence of Life\\" which consists of interviews with Godfrey Reggio and Philip Glass. A very good supplement with worthy insights from both Glass and Reggio on the nature and message of the film.
B00006J9OT|4.0|I already had the DVD version, but broke down and bought this because &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot; wasn't on the DVD and its one of my favs.<br />Its really good, but if you have a DVD player, its better to listen to this recording in glorious surround sound (preferably DTS).
0385503954|5.0|Does your heart miss a beat when you see a new book by Dan Koontz? Have You ever marvelled at the writing style of John Saul? If so... you will hate this book. You will find the first 150 pages unbearable, and you probably will not realize that there is actually a surprise ending (it is very subtle). I don't mean to be rude, but this novel is simply not for everyone. However, if you enjoy well written and plush details (Which reminds a little of Daisy Miller, and some of Henry James' works).  I enjoyed this novel, even though I did find some of the reading a bit tedious (I do enjoy Stephen King ;o)  ), but by the final page... I was completely won over. Excellent choice, not quite Dickens.. but still very well written.
B000068QY7|5.0|The British fab 5 have done it again, this time with a booming, rocking album that puts even the Beatles to shame!!<br />As England's \\"Q\\" magazine would say, \\"People are mad fer it!!\\"<br />I like how the younger Gallagher genius gets to write some of his own tunes this time 'round - look out Liam! I also dig the new guys they got to help on the album - it gives it more flavor.<br />In short, if you dig great lyrics, great vocals, and catchy rock songs that put even the Rolling Stones to shame, pick this one up, mates!!<br />No doubt, you'll be \\"mad fer it!!\\"<br />LATER!!
B00002MZ2T|4.0|I love this album, it's for thinking, studying and chilling. The lyrics are wonderful, and to quote the maker of &quot;How To Listen To Music With Poetic Lyrics&quot; &quot;Poetry, I tell ya!&quot; So true. I gave this cd a four because of the song &quot;Affirmation&quot;. It has a fine beat but the lyrics are awful. I can't even listen to that song without thinking, &quot;I could write WAY better lyrics then that!&quot; All they're talking about is annoying cliches that EVERYONE probably agrees with. To me, this is not pop music, it's the saivor of pop music (and if pop music gets saved, I would NOT call it pop music, I would call it good music!). Just like The Vines are the saivors of rock n' roll, Savage Garden are saving pop, one of the worst geners in the world.    <BR>PEACE OUT! :)
0743424425|5.0|I didn't get to read all of it because I had checked it out of the library in town, but I found that everything i read i loved. I had also checked out bag of bones by S.K. and Without Remorse by Tom Clancy. I had three weeks to read all three books and i was close to finishing this one. It is now my most favorite book of all time and am still looking forward to purchasing it. I originally got it because my favorite band ,lollipop lust kill, song \\"Bury You\\" was based on it. I now hooked on it.
B00005JL3A|2.0|The score to this film was flawless but, the movie itself is just another average in my book. Marilyn Manson did the score for this movie and he did  a job! If you watch the commentary to this movie they said that they didn't want to show zombies in the beginning because, you knew that you were gonna see some any way. The film didn't even have enough gore to be a serious zombie movie. I give this 2.5 stars.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is the first Incubus album I've listened to the whole way through, so I have nothing to base my comparisons on... But Morning View in general is very mixed. Some of its songs like \\"Mexico\\", and \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" are very acoustic and soft, while others, such as \\"Under My Umbrella\\" and \\"Blood on the Ground\\" are harder. If you like a variety of sounds, this album is a must-have. I bought it during the summer of 2002, and I listen to it almost nonstop. You can *not* get sick of this album. It's not physically possible. Brandon  Boyd's voice is the most incredible *drools*
630529142X|5.0|I think this movie is great.The truth is you either love it,or hate it.There is no between.To enjoy this movie  you only need one thing:sense of humour.The plot is not very thick,but that's not what makes a good comedy.Simple and funny!
B00006J9OT|5.0|JazBrat's review is not quite correct:<br />Most of the material here is not included on the Video/DVD version of these appearances - this CD is no clone of the DVD - I believe only 2 or 3 tracks are also on the DVD. also included is a bonus studio track (cover of Just The Way You Are - from an upcoming film)<br />Word is that Verve Records recorded 4 nights and Tommy LiPuma (producer) and Diana picked their favorite tracks - with an apparent focus on her small group performances.<br />the recording quality is impeccable - here's your chance to bring Diana's live show home with you...fabulous
B00005UEAR|5.0|I just have to say that I am so tired of people calling bands like Dream Theater self-indulgent as if it were a bad thing.  I for one and glad there are bands like them out there that write music for themselves, and if people like it, great, and if they don't, they don't have to listen to it.  It's nice to see bands that don't write music for anybody but themselves, a lot of people in bands out there are probably digging what I'm talking about right now.           But getting on track, I think that this is a masterpiece of an album.  On a whole both discs are extremely well put together and orchestrated, but as far as craftsmanship of material I definitely believe the second disk is the meat and potatoes.  From the opening of the Overture to the last notes of the Grand Finale, I was pretty much captivated by this disk.  There were a few low points (the beginning of Goodnight Kiss did not move me, to say the least) but other than that, I think it is easy to recognize the flow of the album and the relationship of all the parts to the overture.  As a concept lyrically, it has similarities for me to The Wall, although that does not mean it sounds like the Wall or they are copying Pink Floyd.  It is just a very well put together album, and if you like non-self-indulgent, manufactured music, listen to Shakira and Drowning Pool and Godsmack.  If you like good music check out bands like this.  The best music is not written for the masses, or for commercial success, but some still like it for what it is.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Lots of action?  Check.<br />Lots of fun? Check.<br />Deep romantic entanglements and thought-provoking ideas that make you wonder &quot;What really is my purpose in life?  Am I everything I should be?&quot;  Um, no.  Thank goodness.<br />Lara Croft does pretty much what she does in the videogames, she goes on a QUEST to find a THING that has great POWER or VALUE.  It works in the games and has worked in the movies for about 80 years now, so does it break new ground?  Nope.  It's basically &quot;Indiana Jones 4&quot; with Angelina Jolie as Indy.  And that's perfectly fine with me...
B00006AG5N|5.0|This is a collection of Elvis's most popular -- not necessarily his best -- songs. The CD has a nice crisp sound, and most of the songs are still worth listening to.<br />Just to mention a few songs:  \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\": absolutely unique when I first heard it in 1956.  Nobody had ever sung a song like this before.  \\"Jailhouse Rock\\": sounds like Keith and Mick, but predates the Stones by several years.  \\"Burning Love\\": great energy and that great line \\"a hunka, hunka burning love.\\" \\"Suspicious Minds\\": another unique, one-of-a-kind song.  <br />Then, there are some guilty pleasures here.  That infectious little ditty \\"and Marie's the name of his latest flame\\" and the line that made English teachers hate Elvis \\"I ain't never did no wrong\\" from \\"One Night.\\"  <br />Elvis is the guy you hoped your daughter wouldn't bring home to introduce to you.  There is something vastly interesting about a person with so much talent that he can afford to waste it while the rest of us strive to make our tiny, insignificant mark on the world. Or if it wasn't talent, what was it?
B00006F7S4|5.0|You've got to wonder what Beck's ex-girlfriend is feeling right now. Imagine this, your boyfriend of nine years, whom you've recently broken up with, has just released an sad album on which *every* song is about his post-breakup depression. On top of that, the album received five-stars from Rolling Stone (only the second this year) and is considered by many to be an instant classic. The ex-boyfriend is Beck and his album is called Sea Change.<br />The music is deceptively simple and beautiful. The wackiness of Beck's previous efforts is gone and the blatant weirdness is replaced by an backward sincerity. Musically and lyrically, this album is very real. The music creates a soft bed upon which Beck's voice floats over, lands on, and sinks into. The vocal performance is in stark contrast to the &quot;heartfelt&quot; pop-vocal performances of today. Beck is whispering his sorrows in our collective ear, rather than screaming at us. It is a very bold and personal effort.<br />Sea Change, while not yet being called a concept album, seems to follow the appropriate rules for a concept album. The first song, &quot;Golden Age&quot; sets up the mood and the situation. &quot;Put your hands on the wheel / Let the golden age begin / Let the window down / Feel the moonlight in your skin / Let the desert wind cool your aching head / Let the weight of the world drift away instead&quot; Beck is welcoming us into his melancholy world, telling you to hold on, allow his sadness (moonlight) to touch you, and escape into his pain. Likewise, the song's instrumentation begins simply with an acoustic guitar and ends with a kind of electronic white noise.<br />The last song, &quot;Side Of The Road&quot;, wraps up the journey by returning the listener to the road; the trip is over. The instrumentation is back to traditional acoustic instruments, no electronic blips and beeps. In the end, Beck tells us, &quot;On a borrowed dime / In a different light / You might see what / The other side looks like / ...Let it pass / On the side of the road/ What a friend could tell me now&quot; In essence, I think Beck is saying that now that you've seem my misery, know that it doesn't have to be your own experience -- in fact, you'd probably be better off letting it simply pass.<br />It's hard to choose a favorite song since they all kind of run into each other and maintain a consistent mood. Truth be told, every song is great, every song is beautiful. Each listen seems to bring more understanding and more insight into Beck's sadness. Immediate standouts include the opener, &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, as well as &quot;Guess I'm Doing Fine&quot;, &quot;Lost Cause&quot;, &quot;Nothing I Haven't Seen&quot;, and &quot;Sunday Sun&quot;.<br />It's a great album. There is emotion in every note, every word. Behind all the pain and sadness there is beauty and possibly even joy. It's easily the best album I've heard all year and ranks among my favorites of all time. It's part Harvest-era Neil Young, part Air, with a healthy dose of Nick Cave thrown in for good measure. But all those different components come together to create something unique, something truly honest. Sea Changes is a personal look into Beck's emotions and inner thoughts. It's something that shouldn't be missed.like / ...Let it pass / On the side of the road/ What a friend could tell me now&quot; In essence, I think Beck is saying that now that you've seem my misery, know that it doesn't have to be your own experience -- in fact, you'd probably be better off letting it simply pass.<br />It's hard to choose a favorite song since they all kind of run into each other and maintain a consistent mood.

6304415346|5.0|\\"Star Trek: First Contact\\" is exactly what any sci-fi blockbuster should be: loaded with special effects, laced with light humor, blessed with interesting characters, and packed with non-stop action! This is the very best of the \\"Star Trek\\" movies. The plot concerns the evil cybernetic race the Borg and their attempt to go back in time to invade Earth and the crew of the Enterprise-E rushing to save humanity. The visuals are amazing and the action is the best in the series. From the first space battle to the Borg invading the ship to the deflector dish battle to the final showdown, this movie has a fast pace as well as rich characters. Jonathan Frakes, who also plays Riker, is a talented director who directed some of the best episodes of \\"The Next Generation\\" TV series. He keeps this movie flowing and the action frequent. But most of all, this movie has heart and deep concern for its characters. That's what \\"Star Trek\\" is all about.
B000002KON|4.0|After reading all these reviews, I feel stupid saying I think &quot;Drivin&quot; and &quot;Australia&quot; are two of the weakest moments on this album.  Regardless, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; and &quot;Some Mother's Son&quot;, brilliant.  Anyway, I don't have a whole lot to add to these reviews, except to say that some of you people need to give &quot;Muswell Hillbillies&quot; another go.  Perhaps I'm too American, but I think it's the Kinks' one truely flawless album.  Whatever, that's just me.  To each Kinks fan his own.
B00001MXWX|2.0|This is a flat entry in the highly successful film series. Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise-E go to a mystical planet to save the inhabitants, who are kind of like space hippies. F. Murray Abraham is our over-the-top villain, Ru'afo, but is about on-par with the laughable (but better) Kruge or Sybok. And is it just me, or are nine out of ten Starfleet Admirals conniving, scheming lunatics? Admiral Dougherty is definitely one of them. I think what this film has going for it are the exciting climax and the neat-o space battle with Riker commanding the Enterprise against the Son'a. But this movie seems confused; it wants to be either a comedy, an action, or a love story, but doesn't succeed in either. Jonathan Frakes is a fine director and he gives this film a very fun look. It is the script that feels old and used, like it was thrown around the Paramount lot a little too much. Scenes with Worf and Data that are intended to be humorous fall flat on their faces. The scenes between Riker and Troi are cute and playful, but barely produce a subplot. Dr. Crusher and Geordi LaForge are pushed way in the background; there is a scene where Geordi at last has the gift of sight that is over before you know it and mentioned briefly, but never developed on. Here is a character that has been blind all his life now having the chance to see with his own eyes, and the screenplay pushes it into the far background. The scene between Picard and Dougherty work as well as the final fistfight between Ru'afo and the Captain, but the scenes between Picard and the Ba'ku leader, Anij, are just sci-fi blunders in an attempt to make a love story. The final plot twist at the end has little impact on the viewer and is all-too-obvious. As far as \\"Trek\\" films go, this is a wannabe.
B00005JKZ3|1.0|Man, the trailer for this movie was promising, but once I saw it I realized I had made a big mistake.  Don't be fooled! All the funny parts are in the previews!  This movie was a carbon copy of the first Men in Black, except that Tommy Lee Jones' role was reversed with Will Smith's this time.  The only thing that could have saved this movie, or at least made it half decent, is if Zed (MIB leader) had died and all the characters are like \\"Where's Zed?\\" and Frank the pug comes out and says \\"Zed's dead baby, Zed's dead\\" kinda like Pulp Fiction.
B00006950W|3.0|I thought that Resident evil could have been a bit better for example they could have introduced the characters a bit more.<BR>I thought that the girl in the red dress was Gill from the origional.

0061053147|5.0|The book is written by Paul M. Sammon in 1996, about 15 years since the original release and 4 years after the Director's Cut re-release. As he explains in the opening chapter of the book, Sammon worked for a science fiction magazine called Cinefantastique, and what began as a double-issue special on the making of the highly-anticipated film Blade Runner eventually evolved into what Sammon calls an \\"exhaustive archaeology\\" of information regarding the film.<br />The novel is simply an overwhelming wealth of information on all things Blade Runner; chapters focus on every minute detail such as the evolution of the story as it passed through the hands of Phillip K. Dick's novel, Hampton Fancher's screenplay, then into the hands of David Peoples and Ridley Scott. Chapter VIII is such a delight, as it meticulously works through each scene in the film, stopping along the way to add tidbits of info such as exclusive interviews with the actors. Sammon apparently also had the luxury of roaming the set of Blade Runner, and he reveals things such as the futuristic magazine covers he would see on the magazine racks and many other incredibly obscure decorations the design team threw in that are virtually impossible to see when you watch the film.<br />Like the other reviewers, I agree that Sammon is not perhaps the most skilled writer, and the prose of the book is very choppy and (especially in Chapter I) pretty corny. What troubles me most, though, is that Sammon has a particularly annoying habit of throwing out names without properly introducing them and explaining their role in the Blade Runner universe. Mercifully, there is a cast and crew listing printed as an appendix, which is a great help.  This, and some of the other errors in the book seem quite obvious, and it leaves one wondering who was in charge of the editing.<br />Anyhow, the book allows great insight into the workings of the film, all gathered from what must be piles and piles of notes and cassette-recorded dialogue Sammon collected over the years to produce a rather well-organized book for fans of the film to read. I have seen the film countless times, and the new perspectives and ideas gained from this book keep the film fresh and wondrous as the years go by.ogue Sammon collected over the years to produce a rather well-organized book for fans of the film to read.

B00000FCBC|5.0|Metallica's best release since ...And Justice For All. This album FAR surpasses Metallica, Load, and Reload! A great re-release of the hard to find Garage Days. Also includes several powerful cover songs from such singers and bands as Bob Segar and the Misfits (ONe of my all time fav bands!) Highly recommended...must have album!
B0000584V3|5.0|Not many bands draw me in, in such way as Opeth. My first Opeth purchase and worth every cent. I am not really much of a fan of death metal but this album offers so much more than just your average Cannibal Corpse style Death Metal. The intricate riffs and harmonies creates such a thick, rich and deep sound that can not be found in any other band. The opening epic, The Leper Affinity, begins with such a huge, agressive riff that many bands would only ever dream of writing. The song powers along until the interlude that slows things down to half-time that unravels the serenity of the acoustic guitar and soft sombre clear tone vocals which is what drew me into this band. The closing piano melody based around the song's chord progression is enough to make anyone melt. An incredible opener. It's common in most opeth songs to interlace the unusual combination of blood curdling, goat sacrificing death metal with such beautiful acoustic work, but they pull it off with such persicion. It's the kind well polished, fantasticly crafted music that even some of todays finest composers like John Williams or James Horner would have to give credit. The album contains songs for all moods with pretty much pure metal like The Funeral Portrait or a relaxing tune like harvest that makes you feel like you standing in that fog filled swamp in the early hours of the morning that's on the cover. If I was forced to choose a fav track (It is so hard) probably Bleak for the massively powerful vocal melody or The Drapery Falls for the melancholy guitar melody over a nice strummed guitar. But the whole album is just completely brilliant!!! All I can say is bring on Deliverance!
B000002H33|5.0|After years of listening to Metallica, and seeing their continual musical growth, Master of Puppets remains their best album to date. As far as shear talent, ...And Justice For All, for a shear power sound, Master of Puppets. This is an essential recording for any metal or Metallica fiend! This album is one of my top ten metal albums of all time. Not the typical pseudo-metal conglomerations that are so prevalent now, this is what real metal is supposed to sound like! Highly recommend!
0783240287|1.0|The only reason I gave this one star is because we all know that people don't read the good reviews, we only read the bad ones.<br />Well this PRODUCTION of this show deserves at least a 4. For all of you whining about things like the overproduction of the show, keep in mind that this version of this show was produced to appeal directly to children. You're certainly not going to keep the attention of a 4 year old if it looked like it did on stage!<br />And what's all this complaining about having the children singing and in some of the scenes. Kids enjoy seeing kids! How difficult is that to see???<br />Okay, I'll definitely agree that the Collins scene is WAY too sexed up. That was a big mistake. I find myself skipping over this scene when I'm watching with my kids. Also, someone mentioned the sound problems on a home theatre and I'm seeing them too.<br />Look, Realize this, very few stage shows (with the exception of Into the Woods) can be adapted to film with no changes. You're looking at a whole different kind of audience- many of which have never set foot in a REAL theatre. Give them a break, they did a darn good job for what they had to work with.<br />Oh, and if you're just writing because you don't like the show- give the guy a break, he was in college when he wrote it! I'd like to see one of YOUR first college projects!<br />Now be nice....
B000002TPS|4.0|While not as good as the previously released Rust In Peace, Youthanasia definitely surpasses nearly all of their other albums. This is the watershed album of later realeased Megadeth albums. Powerful metal sounds, combined with highly sophisticated lyrics make this an introspective journey into the heart of Megadeth. Some of the best tracks include...&quot;Addicted to Chaos&quot;, &quot;I Thought I Knew It All&quot;, and &quot;A Tout Le Monde.&quot; HIghly recommend!
6303379214|5.0|In this beautifully filmed story, Faith (Marisa Tomei) is getting ready to marry a successful podiatrist when Damon Bradley, the man of her dreams calls up to speak to her fiance. Damon's a man that she's never met; however, as a young girl in a game of Ouija board, she asked the name of the man that she would marry. The answer was Damon Bradley. Faith probably would have ignored that, but several years later, she's again given the same name by a Gypsy fortuneteller. She feels that she can't ignore the phone call and takes off for Italy to meet Damon Bradley who she thinks may be her soul mate.  <br />Bonnie Hunt is charming in the part of Kate, Faith's sister-in-law. She flies to Rome with her because she thinks that Faith is nuts to do something so reckless and dangerous. Kate's own marriage is lacking in romance and she's thrown off balance when a dashing Italian gigolo pursues her. <br />The scenery is breathtaking and beautiful in Italy and Faith meets several attractive men in her search for Damon Bradley. Robert Downey Jr.is endearing in the roll of a shoe salesman, and Marisa Tomei has never been more attractive.<br />Very enjoyable and fun!
B000002UUX|5.0|Definitely the finest Megadeth album to date. Rust In Peace was the highest musical moment for the band. Dark, aggressive, and powerful...this is what Megadeth is all about. This album holds its place on the list of greatest metal albums of all time. If you want to listen ot Megadeth, you simply must have this album before any other. War, nuclear destruction, Area 51...what else do you need for a great metal album?! Highly recommend!
B000005DQR|5.0|Entroducing is by far the best album I have ever heard.  I own albums from almost every genre of music (other than country), and Entroducing seems to be a melting pot of all those styles.  It could not have been put together any better.  I truly applaud DJ Shadow on this one, and he has truly inspired me.  Whether you're a fellow DJ, a Hip Hop fan, a Trip Hop Fan, or just a music fan, you WILL enjoy and love this album.  Laid back beats, dope piano lines, nice strings, a bit of jazz here and there mixed in....it just doesn't get any better.  Do not think twice about buying this album, get it NOW.  You will not be disappointed in anyway.
B000002H97|4.0|Metallica's self-titled album was a monumental release for the band, but wasn't thier greatest musical achievement. While this album introduced them to a whole new group of fans, die-hard fans had been listening for a long time previous. Die-hard fans will also view this album as a a fantastic release, but will not let it surpass their other albums as no. 1. I highly recommend this album, but I recommend more that you seek out their earlier albums first.
B00005AQGH|3.0|The only song that I really truly liked was Hail Mary.  The rest of the CD was okay.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All. This is what metal is all about. Second only to their previous realease, Master of Puppets, this album is an essentail Metallica recording! While Master of Puppets showcased the bands raw energy and pwerful sound, this album brings them to their musical peak. Their most ambitious and talent revealing album, filled with incredible drum work and guitar riffs that contribute to the incredbile sounds known only to Metallica. Top ten metal album. Highly recommended!
B00000IPAX|2.0|For all its attempt to appeal through the shocking, the bizarre, the quaintly curious (or just however its cover and song titles might strike you), I found little memorable that stayed with me from listening to this. You'd think this album had some big splash it wanted to make, but for me it was more like just a trickle. I have told myself I'll give it another try. I'll listen to it some more sometime and see if somehow there's a profound message I missed. But I just can't get myself in any hurry to do so, and if I had to give it a one-word discription for now, that one-word would be \\"lame\\".
B00006AG5N|5.0|An awesome remastering job on all the tracks. Way better than anything previously released on CD. The only disappointment is the alternate take of the &quot;Wonder Of You&quot; being used instead of the original hit single. <BR>The sound is incredible on all tracks with unbelievable clarity on Elvis' vocals and all the instrumentation.<BR>I'd give this one a 6 because it's better than a 5.
B000002LQR|1.0|OMG I dunno where to start. First off, I'm a power/prog/thrash/80's heavy metal fan. Someone recommended me this album saying this is their best one, and that this is something metal fans might enjoy. Instead, I find this album to be one of the most ridiculous I've ever listened to. I don't wanna listen to even one song on this album again, and I've placed this CD where it belongs - the trash can. The artists sound like amateurs; the vocalist is god-awful, guitar sound is very muddy, and the guitar playing is bad, and the song writing is very loose.
B000066NW0|5.0|what can i say?  this record is one of the best and most surprising albums i've heard in a very, very long time.  i saw the record on the National Listening Stations at Tower Records here in Dallas, and gave it a listen.  within a couple of songs, i stopped the player and headed for the checkout counter.  i was overwhelmed at how much depth/musical ability/vocal range this girl had, and was surprised to hear from a friend who worked there that she was only 17!<BR>every single song on this record is awesome.  the amazon.com editorial review at the top of this page, to me, is incorrect.  avril's lyrics are very well written and expressed.  they do delve into adolescense at times, but let's not forget, she's a teenager.  i am a poet with my first book about to be published, and believe me, i think she has a better grasp on words and phrasing than i did at 16 or 17!<BR>this album is a must have for anyone who likes singer-songwriters, girl rockers, or just good music in general.  avril has a take charge, no holds barred attitude as well.  she is able to show a softer, tender side, as well as rock hard on the album.  it is widely known that the record execs wanted her to sing other people's songs, but she simply refused.  she asked to be given a chance to show that she was a competent writer, and boy has it paid off!!!  thanks to the label for letting her do her thing!  buy this album now!!!!!!!
B0000542D2|1.0|to quote John Lennon...\\"Tell Me Why\\"?  <BR>why Mira Max....did you not include the bonus features from the now highly collectable orignal DVD release of this movie?  The out of print version , which was made from a remastered negative, also has a vintage interview with Richard Lester, his film \\"Running Jumping & Standing\\" with Peter Sellers, which got him this gig, a theatrical trailer and bonus \\"newsreel\\" footage of the fab four....NONE of which is on this new two disc joke.  <br />perhaps I should calm down and admit that interviews with the photographer and George Martin are nice and Klaus Voorman is fun to watch.....once.  Where are the BEATLES ?  there is deleted and outake material which would have been much more interesting than the endless talking heads from United Artists droning on and on about the fact that they didn't know who the Beatles were but all knew \\"we would make a lot of money\\" with this movie. <br />Oh, and the packaging?  the original DVD had the look and spirit of the original LP and movie etc, with a nice little insert with pictures.....this eco pak features four fuzzy out of focus pictures of the individual Beatles and a group shot which is equally poor in quality and no booklet.  I can't believe that they couldn't find better quality photos than this....whoever organized this set must not have been alive in the 60's and really must have been on deadline....I am suprised that  they didn't flop the neg on Pauls photo to have him playing right handed....that is the level of interest they seem to have displayed elsewhere.  oh yeah, and 14 lousy chapters to the original 29?  this reeks of doing things on the cheep...yet they rolled out the publicity campaign to hype this and smere the previous edition as inferior....HA, that is why they are fetching well over a hundred bucks a piece on the auctions......<br />Buy this for the movie...it is a classic...and the proper aspect ratio of 1:66 is nice, but  we should hope that the fools that put thistogether are not involved with the follow up films.
B000007S5B|2.0|my whole thing is... this cd is titled &quot;waiting for the sun&quot; right?.. and most of us are familiar with the song &quot;waiting for the sun&quot; right?.. but where the bejeenitch is the song on this cd.  it lists all songs, except the title track... oh m.f. well
0553382179|5.0|I would also like to write a note about the &quot;religious agenda&quot; that one reviewer here mentioned.  Yes, Flylady does mention God, and religious phrases in places, but I can hardly say this book has a religious agenda.  I'm a pagan as well(so would in no way be out to further any 'religious agenda' of Flylady's), and have been a member of Flylady's helping list for a long time.  Anything she has to say of a religious nature in relation to cleaning is something that is meant in a sincerly helpfull way.  There are times I will think of her 'God breezes' as 'Goddess breses' or 'Frigga(norse goddess, patron of home and hearth) breses' ;-)  But yes, you can tell Marla is a Christian, and that her beliefs are enmeshed with her life, but hey! I'm a pagan, and my beliefs are enmeshed with my life and I can find the same kinds of messages from my religion!<br />Anyway, This book is a compilation of the e-mails and website material.  I think it's a wonderfull thing to have around if you're like me and getting on the computer to check your e-mail is something that really puts a hold on your progress.  It's also easier to find needed information in the book rather than the website.<br />I'm nowhere near perfect at keeping house, but always making progress!!  I have decluttered over 1,000 lbs of STUFF and clutter since starting the flylady program and I don't miss any of it!  I don't feel guilty about keeping the things that are precious to me because those things are now nicely displayed/framed, and they bring more joy to my life now that all the other stuff isn't getting in the way.<br />The Flylady program has made life much better for me and my family. :-)<br />I would also like to reccomend 'Home Comforts: The art and science of keeping house which is a very in-depth book with a lot of information about cleaning things, washing things, and our outlook on our homes.
B000066NW0|4.0|Though Sk8er Boi gets the most radio airtime, it may well be the weakest selection on the CD. Avril's true style, I think, comes out much better in other songs. People who buy the CD for Sk8er Boi will be disappointed, but there's no reason to be disappointed by this CD at all. If you give the other songs a chance, you'll see that they are much better than some people give them credit for. Avril's a talented musician, and I hope to hear more from her in the future.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I personally don't know anything more scary than a killer who is smarter than me and believes that his murdering me is both moral and, if done properly, tasteful. This film is about degradation. People are complaining that the scene at the end is too disgusting and violent, etc, etc. I suppose it would be better if a depiction of a murder committed by a cannibal were made acceptable for general viewing. The bottom line is that this film pulls off what it is trying to: morality is created in the human intellect, and the human mind is, despite the societal boundaries and niceties it's engaged in everyday, little more than the primal animal brain. If you want to understand a criminal, understand that a criminal is an animal in rebellion against society. More than that you can't hope to know, even from consulting the quickest of criminal minds. This was the theme carried over from Silence of the Lambs. <br />That said, this is most certainly not the same movie. It's barely a sequel. There is not better or worse because there is little comparison. Standing on its own, this film has brilliant acting, writing, cinematography and directing. Furthermore, the thematic content is mind-boggling and not like any other representation of taboo/criminal acts that has been seen on the Big Screen before. <br />If you are offended by violence or human degradation or are a religious freak that wants to contrast this movie against all Hopkin's Christian-related movies in a biased review, don't go see this. I'm not sure why anyone like that would decide to lay down [money] for a ticket to see a horror movie about a cannibal anyway. But if that is the case, if you are looking for HOPEFUL cannibalism, I would suggest 'Alive!'.
0385335482|5.0|this book is wonderful. my whole family has loved it soo much. it's so good and i have read all of them. i can't wait to read the third book. i recommend this book to anyone. if u read this book im sure this book will become your new favorite book. just like it did to me!!!! THANX i hope this gave u help
B000006Z8E|5.0|Banco's second album is a real grower and is a totally amazing masterpiece of Italian prog. The album's production and music has improved over their debut, released earlier the same year as Darwin! in 1972. The synthesizers are much more present as well. The band continues on the same classically-influenced, duo keyboards from the Nocenzi brothers and the semi-operatic voice of Francesco di Giacomo. Darwin! is a concept album about evolution and the rejection of Creationism. Unlike the original LPs of their previous album and their following (Io Sono Nato Libero), which were issued in gimmick packaging, the original LP of Darwin! was issued in normal gatefold packaging. Anyway, the album opens up with \\"L'Evoluzione\\" which is totally amazing. It's the longest piece on the album, and it's stuffed with great themes and solos. Some of the passages reminds me a little of ELP, or even Gentle Giant, for that matter. The next cut, the largely instrumental \\"La Conquista Della Posizione Eretta\\" is totally stunning. The synth sound has gotta be heard to be believed, it just sounds so dramatic and big. This cut alone is what made Banco one of the greats of Italian prog. I am also reminded of \\"Metamorfosi\\" from their previous album, as it's structured similarly: as about three quarters of the cut consists of lengthy solos, then the end part ends with vocals, only I think the vocal section here works better than on \\"Metamorfosi\\". \\"Danza dei Grandi Rettili\\" is a instrumental jazzy piece, rather laid-back, sounding a little different from what I'm accustomed to from Banco. There's an amazing ballad, \\"750.000 Anni Fa... L'Amore\\" which is by far the best Banco ballad I ever heard. \\"Miserere Alla Storia\\" tends to have a rather sinister atmosphere, while the last cut, \\"Ed Ora Io Domando Tempo al Tempo Ed Egli Mi Risponde... Non Ne Ho!\\" has a rather carousel waltz-like feel that sounds very Italian. I like the use of harpsichord and reed organ on that cut. I took me a few more listens to appreciate than Io Sono Nato Libero, but in the end, I feel Darwin! is just as great and essential. This album is right up there with Museo Rosenbach's Zarathustra, Le Orme's Felona e Sorona, PFM's Per Un Amico, Osanna's Palepoli, Cervello's Melos, and of course Banco's Io Sono Nato Libero, as far as Italian prog goes, so if you enjoy Italian prog, Darwin! is absolutely essential!
6302453356|5.0|I love this movie. Actually, I love anything that Steven Speilburg directs, but hey. This movie is a good follow-up to Peter Pan, with everything from funny moments to special effects. It dragged on a little at the beginning, but after that it was great fun. I love all the suspense (such as when the hook on the window is opening; or when the dead crocodile comes back to life for a moment and eats Hook) and I love all the scenery (such as the full views of Never Land). If you want to see a decent Peter Pan sequel thing, rent it. You most likely won't be disappointed.
0380820846|2.0|Truly a snore.  Good god, nothing exciting happens.  Nothing really happens at all!  The dialogue is flat and lame.  A lot of fluffy polite conversations about nothing.  ZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  However, the greatest disappointment is that we FINALLY discover who the notorious Lady Whistledown is (a big plot in this book) and THAT character is at best, anemic and bland.  She's not remotely believable as the wickedly sharp, funny, insightful, intelligent, mischevious Lady Whistledown.  It does not do that mysterious and saucy character justice.  The story of Lady Whistledown had such tremendous potential,  but it falls miserably flat.  A horrible disappointment.   Lazy story telling.  What a waste.  <BR>P.S.  the hero of this story isn't particularly exciting either.
B000063WDH|5.0|This is what rock and roll is all about. 2 kids in a basement, bang'n away, .... All great american music is african-american based, and this is no exception. The roots show, but they don't get tangled up in them. These aren't wannabes or  pretenders. They hear the same thing that Elvis, Mick Jagger and Jimi Hendrix heard;  the raw  passion of the blues, and they use it to construct a language that we haven't heard in 40 years: rock and roll.  They don't need no ... strings, no ... horns and no slight of hand. All they  need is great guitar, drums and soul.  ....
B0000542D2|1.0|Being a big Beatle fan, and a big fan of this movie, I highly anticipated the arrival of this title on DVD. The sound on this DVD is bad, there is absolutely no dynamic range. The volume level seems to hover at the same level through out the film, there is no difference in volume between the scenes when there is a quiet conversation and the scenes where the band is playing. I also own the title on laserdisc and let me tell you, the laserdisc has at least 30 db of dynamic range. While watching this film on laserdisc, you can adjust the level of playback so that the scenes where there is conversation is a comfortable 75 db, and when the band plays it jumps up to an ear thumping 105 db or more. This DVD lacks ooph, the band sounds like their playing in a box. This film deserves a better sound treatment, I highly recommend boycotting the DVD and lets wait till they release it in it's proper state.
B00000F5KH|5.0|This is a film of contrasts. From Rio de Janeiro's Metropolis-like urban hell to Brasil's Nordeste - a barren place of barren and huge landscapes and unmittigated Faith.<BR>Dora's character, played by sublime actress Fernanda Montenegro (Oscar nominated and certainly worthy of winning...) evolves from an urban Rio de Janeiro's letter writer-devil'll do all to a mother figure to street kid Josu after his own mother dies.<BR>After that this is a spiritual road movie - for Josu's long lost father - and for Dora's long lost faith in herself and in other human beings - which she eventually achieves most purely in Josus character.<BR>This is a powerful movie. Christianly so. Any religion-so. But mostly a movie about trust in the residual bits of humanity that allow those in near-despair to believe. Maybe not in God as such - but in christian individuals as such...<BR>So is this a religious movie? Not exactly. And not at all a Catholic one.<BR>But it is a delightful innocent mix-up of beliefs, with a kind of untainted christianism standing out.
0345413377|5.0|After finishing His Dark Material's trilogy, i couldnt stop crying and all i could think about was that this was sooooo unfair. My heart was broken but i never once stopped loving the three books.<BR>For two years i couldnt read the last book without feeling a sense of lose and sadness but now i come to realise that this was the best ending to my favorite triology and that Phillip Pullman is brilliant.<BR>Will, Lyra, Iorel Bryrnison, Serafina Pakkala and all the other unforgetable characters are very well developed and so very beleivable and loveble.<BR>I'm in love with his dark materials triology from now to always. I reccommend all people of the world to read this book and the other two in the series. You will love them!!<br />ps: anyone who thinks that these books are offending to the christian religion i would just like to say it is a work of pure, unspoiled and original FICTION. Meaning it is not meant to offend but to entertain and delight.
6305313687|5.0|Wow, what a great movie. I can't even express how good this movie is. This movie takes place in Venice Beach where a man (Derek) is in a white power gang and is sent to prison for killing two men who were trying to steal his car, but while in prison he realizes that life is too short to hate all the time, so when he gets out of prison he gives up all his racist past, but getting out of his old gang isn't as easy as he thougth it would be, especialy since his little brother is also part of it. Please if you watch this movie watch it for what it is, too many people don't realize this is a movie about anti-hate and anti-racism. A must watch.
0375707972|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the greatest books in recent history. <br />I am not going to talk about all the different great aspects of it, the language (at least in German), the way the story develops and the realistic way Schlink portrayed post-war Germany.<br />Instead I want to say something about most of the negative reviews on this site. I do grant everyone his/her own opinion, but it seems to me that most people who wrote a negative review actually do this because they cannot handle dealing with a narrator who can still see positive and likable sides in a character who does things that are not socially accepted.<br />Here we have Hannah, a mature woman who obviously seduces a fifteen year old boy and really makes him obedient to her. And if that was not enough, we later find out that she has been working in a concentration camp. So why does this woman not come across as an egomaniac monster hungry for power over other people? I think everybody has to find this out on his/her own and then judge Hannah and also Michael by himself/herself. <br />One of the great freedoms this book gives to us is to decide for ourselves how we feel about the characters, especially Hannah. I realize that many people are not used to this and would rather prefer a book where it is simple to love or hate a character, which teaches us a lesson that is, oh, so simple to gather from the story, because it is written out on every page.<br />If you are looking for this then do not read this book. Read it if you like to make up your mind on your own and if you accept it that all people have positive and negative character traits. <br />And by the way, please do not read the review below if you have not already read the book because it might spoil the climax for you. The solution is not that hard to figure out, but still nobody should scream it all over this place to rob people of their enjoyment of this book.
B000059XUP|4.0|I was worried when I first started watching this, wondering if I wasted my money. Granted it does have just about the same story as the first, except Ash and his son Danny get shot for witnessing a murder instead of in the first they were killed because of Devils Night. Not too far into the movie I realized it was going to be good, they kept the miserable dark look of the city like in the first and Vincent Perez did a worderful job. So if you liked the first Crow I recomend you see City Of Angels, like I said not good as the first but a good follow up.
0316666343|3.0|When I first started this book, I couldn't put it down, although a morbid sad story, it got me hooked.  Unfortunately, I found the mothers reaction to the situation rather hard to believe, as hard as I tried to put myself in her shoes, I just could never ever abandon the rest of my family.  I also thought it was strange how the murderer could just disappear from the neighborhood without being located, to me it was just too unreal, so therefore I lost interest toward the end.  I also agree with another reader as far as the closure at the end.
B00000JCY0|5.0|I can't say enough about Sweet and this amazing CD. These guys were definitely trailblazers in the heavy metal/hard rock genre. Upon listening to 'Sweet Fanny Adams' (1974), the discerning music fan quickly realizes that Sweet's influence on modern 80's metal is undeniable. Anyone dismisses this band as just a 'bubblegum' act ought to be smacked upside the head. Here they crank out some of the earliest true metal tunes found anywhere on record....check out 'Set Me Free', 'Sweet F.A.', 'Into the Night', 'Restless', 'Burn on the Flame' & 'No You Don't'. Also, other great rock tracks included here are 'Heartbreak Today'(not sure why this wasn't a single--it's super), 'Rebel Rouser'(should have been single---it's similar to Sweet's 'Hellraiser' & sounds just like Motley Crue). Really the only tunes that don't measure up to the rest are 'Peppermint Twist' and 'ACDC'....they're fun and cute but one could live without them. <br />The bonus tracks 'Burn on the Flame' (one of Sweet's best ever tracks) and 'Own Up and Take a Look at Yourself' (Bow Wow Wow later [borrowed] the opening vocal melody line in 'I Want Candy') are excellent. <br /> Many of you may know that the US release of 'Desolation Boulevard' was merely compilation of tracks taken from the UK 'Sweet Fanny Adams', the UK 'Desolation Boulevard' and the UK 'Strung Up' (and single B-sides). The record executive eggheads who compiled 'Desolation Boulevard' ought to be [reprimanded] for the tunes they left off that record. Don't get me wrong---they pick some great ones, but they left off many great ones. Some of the best Sweet tunes ever, didn't make it to the album. However, 'Burn on the Flame' did later become the US B-side of 'Fox on the Run' and 'Restless' became the US B-side of 'Ballroom Blitz'. Including 'Heartbreak Today', 'Rebel Rouser' and 'Burn on the Flame' could have made 'Desolation Boulevard a landmark release. <br />That being said----do yourself a favor and buy 'Sweet Fanny Adams' and the UK versionof 'Desolation Boulevard' (contains great tunes like 'Medussa, 'Turn it Down', 'Breakdown' etc...)..........if you are a fan of hard rock and/or metal, you will not be sorry.

1580084621|5.0|Let's start with the positives: extremely thorough review of the Thai experience. Thompson breaks down every ingredient and discusses it thoroughly. Beautifully done with great pictures. You'll learn allot about Thailand from this book.<br />The downside? Well there are allot of steps and that's not Thompson's fault but part of the Thai culinary scene. The ingredients on the other hand could be cheeky for people out of a cosmopolitan city like NYC to obtain: lemon grass, fish sauce, galonga. But the worst was no recipe for fish sauce, which I did find in Mai Pham's book on Vietnamese cooking (its anchovy based:-). Unfortunately most commerical fish sauces are msg prepared and being allergic to it I was hoping for a way to make this myself (fish sauce is a staple of most SE Asian food, Thai included, btw). Alas though not forthcoming Thompson does tell us that the commercially prepared varieties are quite good. <br />Still, despite this,  I did not downgrade the book on that account because I think that this is best book on Thai food I've ever seen & I own The Beautiful Thai Cookbook & What's Thai.  I would recommend neither after reading/using Thompson's book.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|One of the classic pop units of the late seventies/early eighties, Blondie's one word moniker may forever be associated with the group's dynamic frontwoman Deborah Harry, but this long overdue compilation makes a case for the group's own unique dynamic, with their musical palette running the gamut from disco('Heart Of Glass'), reggae('The Tide Is High'),new wave('One Way or Another') and rap('Rapture'). That they can mesh musical styles so seamlessly is even more of a marvel--no one else in pop since has merged styles so seamlessly and with such success. This nineteen track set updates and ultimately eclipses their previous BEST OF--and big kudos for including the sterling 'Maria' from their unjustly overlooked comeback attempt NO EXIT. Blondie fans and pop fans alike would do well to update their cd collection immediately--this is a must-have.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Several of the reviews here are negative because the reviewers say it can't be ripped to a PC. Why do they want to do this? So they can violate the Glimmer Twins copyrights. SHAME ON THEM. This is one of the best albums of all time, in the best representation ever.
B00006F7S4|4.0|...he is a great musical artist.  I've never been a fan of the genre of music Sea Change falls into, but strangely I find myself listening to this album quite at nights and rainy afternoons.  At first listen I thought the album seemed to be blown out of proportion, but after a few listens I think it deserves more praise.  I really do appreciate artists who can bring themselves from a comfortable platform and explore and juxtapose their sound and take there audience with them.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Ok I went looking for this CD, I didn't even know that they came out with the soundtrack for the musical. When I found out the CD had already been out for a few days, it is sold out everywhere!!! I tried soooooooo many stores.....So I can not wait to get my hands on it and listen to it. I loved the episode on tv - I enjoyed the music - so I look forward to listening to it.
B00005ASHM|2.0|After hearing the wonderful Brian Wilson Album, \\"I Just Wasn't Made For These Times\\", and then reading these Amazon reviews that this is the greatest pop album of all time and Brian Wilson's gift to music, I had to seek it out.  Well, the other reviewers must be Beach Boys fans, because this just didn't do it for me.<br />Yes, it has the absolutely exquisite \\"Caroline, No\\" (whose mood is annoyingly destroyed by 30 seconds of train and barking dog at the end) and the heavenly \\"God Only Knows\\".  There are plenty of other very good to excellent songs, such as \\"Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder)\\", \\"Here Today\\", and \\"Sloop John B.\\"<br />Those who grew up with the Beach Boys will also find hokey fare such as \\"That's Not Me\\", \\"I'm Waiting For the Day\\", and \\"I Know There's An Answer\\", notwithstanding many nice harmonic moments.  Some of these songs could be improved by not having Beach Boys instrumentation and arrangements.  You'll also have to slog through the abominable instrumental title track and \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" which will surely produce an immediate negative reaction from anyone who doesn't like the Beach Boys.<br />If I were trying to convince someone like myself who wasn't a big Beach Boys fan that the Beach Boys deserve a more serious listen, I would have them listen to \\"Surf's Up\\", not this one.  Sorry, folks.
B00005221L|5.0|I also grew up on this movie, because I seen it in theaters back in 1987 when it first opened up (including the action sequel &quot;Predator 2&quot; in 1990).  After seeing this movie, I was completely blown away by the spectacular effects seen throughout the entire film, including the Predator's ability to bend light making itself invisible.  For people who haven't seen this and the sequel or just wanna watch it again, I suggest that you buy both movies &amp; eat some popcorn.  Also hope for a &quot;Predator 3&quot; if they ever make it.
B000059HAI|5.0|A very good movie indeed. It basically shows us the true history on how the Japanese planning and US intelligents failure led up to one of USA's worst military debacles of the last century.<br />This film is WAY better than the recent Pearl Harbor movie because it does not show such high patriotism on the US side (or love triangles!) nor the stereotyping of Japanese Navy. In fact it stayed right on the subject till the very end.<br />One of the best things of this movies are the charactors in the film such as Cordell Hull and Yamamoto. You will feel really sympathatic for these charectors. Best of all they are hardly cliched.<br />The battle scenes were very well executed. In fact I liked this one better than the recent movie Pearl Harbor because it looked so real instead looking like some CGI effects.<br />Any History buffs will love this movie.
B000001GPX|1.0|Without argument, Carlos Kleiber's 5th is the definitive recording. But the manufacturers of this CD have taken out a segment of the last movement. I find this incomprehensible and for me it ruined the joy of the symphony before that point. I have listened to the 5th literally hundreds of times, and such a defect is appalling.
B00006J3T4|3.0|Music's good and there are a few good guitar chops in there as well, but as for the lyrics... Mark's been saying in interviews lately that the things that moved him as a kid still do, and hey! Good for him. But who really wants to hear a whole song about the Roadrunner? Or Mulligan Stew? And Why Aye Man: Catchy song there with some Telegraph Road-like elements, but the subject matter is somewhat dated? I don't know. In my opinion, Mark should have waited a couple of more years.
B00003CX9Q|1.0|Being born in the E.T. generation, one might expect me to be more nostalgic about this film.  The problem is that E.T. is one of the most boring, emotionally shallow movies of the last 30 years.  It's only point is to make the viewer depressed over the terrible treatment of an alien being.  The creature E.T. is completely unlovable and unbelievable.  Spielburg is very good at pushing the viewers emotional buttons, but little else.  This movie lacks substance and direction, and I've never felt more bored than when watching this movie.
B00006AG5N|3.0|While the remixing of songs on this CD improve the quality of the tunes, this CD is really not worth purchasing. Only about half of the songs are ones that you will want to listen to over and over. It is amazing how popular some of his really bad songs were. I recommend that you pass on this CD
B000062TU1|5.0|I think that this movie is nice... it is (as the producer said) faithful to the book... I've seen many other movies that are based on books, but were however, not very true to the book, which makes it a little disapointing, coz, many things tt were expected are not there...However, this Harry Potter movie, IMHO is good. I've read the books, and as a HP fan, I like this movie. Whether with the del scenes or not, it's still a great movie. I guess, with all those extra features in the DVD is what makes it worth gettin a DVD raher than a VCD or VHS...now, I can't wait for the new movie to be out.
B00005NWM3|4.0|some people like Justin Wittenmeier, who's alias is 'Slipknot dude' don't appreciate good music.  Slipknot has one or two good songs, but there boring, I'll they do is 'bark'  and scream at the top of their lungs, yeah, great music, can't even understand their lyrics.  <br />Nickelback is a grade A band, terrific head singer, Chad Kroeger, is just a natural at singing.  This CD is worth every penny.  I bought it, and I highly recommend it.
B00005ARDC|5.0|Incredible.....what an album!  These guys have it.....every bit as much as White Stripes, Stroke, Love and Rockets....here's why:<br />Yeah.....Red Eyes And Tears makes it clear we're not in Kansas anymore....nice takeoff when combined with the opening of Love Burns....the lyrics.....wow.....serious thinking going on here if you want it<br />Yeah....Whatever Happened To My Rock `n' Roll.....I gave my soul to a new religion, whatever happened to you?......it sounds like an early Pink Floydish Syd Barett showing up for the Satanic Majesties Request sessions.....it works better than the Stones ever did it (although they stole a riff from Miss Amanda Jones), but they do a punk end run on the Barett thing.....maybe he would have sounded like this if he had stayed sane......get this...there are 2 consecutive tracks in this moove....Awake just keeps it going....dreamily......and it will come up again on Too Real<br />Yeah....White Palms.....my kind of sound....full wall.....deal with it....because it's coming again with Rifles,  and again with Spread Your Love<br />Yeah......As Sure As The Sun and Head Up High for slow introspection<br />And Yeah....the attempt at an anthem on Salvation.....they found a use for that traveling preacher thing they keep trying to use (Jesus left you lonely).........it's a resounding number to stay with you while you restart the CD over and over again
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Successful sequel to the 1998 gore-fest, this time Blade (Snipes)teams up with an elite vampire squad called the Bloodpack (who are actually trained to kill him) to hunt down and eliminate a new and tougher breed of bloodsuckers called the Reapers (reminiscent of Max Schrek's portrayal of NOSFERATU) who attack both humans and vampires. More dark, gothic and grotesque than the original with even better visual effects and martial-arts scenes. Gabriel Beristain's atmospheric photography and Del Toro's focused direction also give this bloodthirsty film a real, horrific European feel. Flawless entertainment all the way.
0316666343|4.0|but there was something missing in it, for me.  Instead, I liked the book enormously, but didn't necessarily enjoy it.<br />Alice Sebold has done an amazing job with a first novel; you can tell she's been writing a long time, and it will be interesting to see her other works.  Her style is very visual, and her words flow like poetry, until she wants you to sit up and take notice; and then she will write something so arresting, that you're not sure how you got around that corner.  Heroine Susie Salmon has very few years on earth, and so even the small things about her life are featured in Sebold's beautiful prose:<br />&quot;I loved the way the burned-out flshcubes of the Kodak Instamatic marked a moment that had passed,.....When they were spent, I took the cubed four-corner flashbulbs and passed them from hand to hand until they cooled.  ...I had rescued the moment by using my camera and in that way had found a way to stop time and hold it.  No one could take that image away from me because I owned it.&quot;<br />Sebold took a visionary point of view, that of the dead girl, and utilized it to tell the story of a family in shambles following a single, telling act of violence.  For me, it helped to explain why this seems to happen to families when violence shatters their worlds.  In Mr. Harvey, Sebold's villain, a character so dark and fearful exists, that surely he must be played on film by the masterful Anthony Hopkins.  There is a central passage in the novel, after the violence and the tone is set, and before a surprising twist near the end, where the novel breaks down, moves slowly, covers the same ground over and over.  During this time, Susie is so passive and sad, that it makes it difficult to read on.<br />But read on, I did, and was glad that I had.  The Lovely Bones is a work to be experienced, not just read, and it deserves a wide following.  I'm sure it will invoke a lot of passion, both pro and con, for the story, and, isn't that what great writing is all about.<br />The Lovely Bones - a 2002 bestseller, and richly deserved.ll about.<br />The Lovely Bones - a 2002 bestseller, and richly deserved.
6302453003|5.0|The film is THE clasic tale of \\"discretion being the better part of valor\\".  Every man, woman and child in the country should see, no - study - this film.  Don't ask about the story line - just SEE IT!
0553579908|5.0|I know I'm just jumping on the bandwagon at this point, but I love this series so much!<br />If you're going to write a 900+ page brick of a novel and your plan is to plump it out with tedious descriptions of clothing, relentless introduction of characters never to be seen again and annoyingly overused mannerisms, you'll eventually lose my respect as a writer.  On the other hand, if those 900+ pages are totally crammed with character development and plot advancement, action and intrigue... you must be George R.R. Martin!<br />How this man does it I'll never know, but he hasn't once faltered.  There's never a smidgen of doubt that he is totally in control of the plot, the characters, and the mood.  Every novel moves the story forward; every character develops and matures -- unless he is cut down instead.  Sometimes a beloved character gets the axe and you have to put the book down till you get past your anger at the author; sometimes a hated character gets his comeuppance and you hiss an exultant \\"Yesss!!!\\", disturbing the person sleeping next to you.  What never happens is that you get bored and give up on the series.  At least, that never happens to me.  Write on, GRRM!  Five more books?  Fifteen?  If they're all half this good, I'll be in line to buy them.
0195067142|5.0|I read this book a few years ago. This book puts you in the mortar pit with the Marines during WWII. I never really understood why they say &quot;War is Hell&quot;, until I read this book.<br />Imagine seeing your dead buddies rotting with maggots and then having a mortar shell explode those remains all over you. Very gritty to say the least. This book reflects we humans at our best and worst all at the same time.<br />A must read.<br />I also recommend, &quot;Charlie Rangers&quot;.
0780624890|2.0|Power-hungry vampire Dorff plans to resurrect an ancient blood god by using the blood of the \\"Day-walker\\", a half-man, half-vampire warrior named Blade (Snipes) who's the blood-sucker's most feared enemy. Ultra-graphic with some of the most stylish martial-arts scenes filmed in American cinema, but after an incredible start the film becomes silly and in-jokey and ends rather appallingly. Based on the comic book.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|This movie is enjoyable up till the ending. The ending is horrible, though! It destroys the character's believability. There are other movies like this: _Primal Fear_ comes to mind. The filmmaker just can't resist sticking in his gimmicky little &quot;surprise twist&quot; ending, even if it ruins the film. Lots of people disagree with my opinion on this, and I don't know what to say to them: if Guy Pierce's character doesn't strike you as a totally unacceptable portrait of a human being, you don't really know our species that well.<br />But up until that phony ending, it's a real nice movie.  The backwards narration forces you to give your full attention, and the result is that you become deeply involved in what's going on. It's quite an experience, and I guess ultimately I recommend this movie for that reason.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I love world war 2 movies and this one is by far the worst. I really wanted to see this movie when it first came out, but then after i saw it i almost died.  Trust me, if you have never seen this movie dont see it. Dont waste your time watching this. IF you want to buy a good world war 2 movie then wait and buy the band of brothers set.  It is much better.
0375703861|5.0|This is her FIRST novel?  Well, that's depressing!  Isn't she supposed to have to... I don't know... pay her dues or something before she writes this well?  <br />On the shelf, this didn't look like &quot;my kind&quot; of novel (I like historical romance and fantasy/science fiction best), but I made the mistake of reading the first page to see what it was like.  That was it -- hooked.<br />The characters are an eclectic mix, and they're all fascinating.  The plot hops back and forth through their lives, but you're able to follow the story beautifully.  It's amusing and touching, sentimental and matter-of-fact.  Very nice.  Not good to read at bedtime though... &quot;Ooh! just a couple more pages till I see what happens...&quot;<br />I thought things got a bit disjointed at the very end.  There were a lot of threads going by that point, and things needed tying up.  Maybe it nudged just a little too far in the madcap direction... but nah, I'm not going to take a whole star off for it.  It was thoroughly enjoyable, and... a first novel?!?  Not really!  Good stuff!
B00005JJX8|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  It showed good character development between the two main characters in the film, Grace Kelly's and Cary Grant's.  The film brought intrigue and good tempo, it wasn't slow and boring in trying to develop its plot.  I enjoyed it for its sense of style, its cinematography, and its attempt to show the world's most wealthiest region that it too can have some excitement!
B00005JKQZ|3.0|I didn't hate this film.  I have seen plenty that are<br />much worse, and that were a greater waste of my precious time.  However, after seeing all the hype and all the award nominations, I came to this film with high expectations, and it simply did not deliver.  What could have been an extremely compelling story ultimately comes off as feel-good fluff much of the time.<br />Plenty of historical fact has been omitted from this movie, but that is no different than any number of movies that are &quot;based on a true story.&quot;  There is no big crime in this; if you want a faithful, comprehensive picture, go read a book.  This is a Hollywood movie, for crying out loud.  Trying to cram a person's entire life story into 136 minutes means that lots of details will have to be left out.<br />The problem is that the omitted details make for one hell of an interesting story!  Bisexuality, numerous affairs, an abandoned illegitimate child, a marriage that was much rockier than the film implied, rank anti-semitism...it all adds up to an individual who very complex and interesting.  The fact that the man has been a complete lout at times does not lessen the heroism of his struggle, or the significance of his achievements.<br />The fact is that just about all of us are equally capable of simultaneously being heroes and cads, but we prefer not to face the dualism of our existence. Here was an opportunity to confront that dualism, in one of its more extreme manifestations, and explore it.  Ron Howard could have done that, but he copped out and left us with a sugar-coated, pre-fab,<br />feel-good movie.
B00006L3LD|5.0|If you have Morning View don't pay 13 bucks for the dvd. I did thinking the songs were live. They're not. I gave it 5 stars cause Morning View is a good album, but not good enough to buy twice. I was tricked by the different cover and the &quot;limited tour edition&quot; above the track listings. When I opened the case to find it was the same one I bought last year, I was kinda upset. The dvd is good though. Good video, funny tour stuff.

If all the things you've read here about clutter amd disorganized lives sound like you, a 45 step daily system on how to put all your STUFF in color-coordinated floral boxes isn't going to fix it.

B00005AQE8|5.0|Ok this cd is just amazing. If you a tupac fan a rap fan or if u just like music at al you will like this. Every song on this album is hot so theres no reson to name a few cause there all great.  To give som info on this since I've read other peoples reviews and they don't know what there talking about i'll clear it up.  Tupac was in jail for a 4 year sentace and suge knight offered to pay the bail for his appeal.  This was only under one condition tupac signed a 3 cd record deal.  Because this cd is a double disk it counts as 2 albums so he already finished 2/3 of his contract.  The third cd which he finished before he died was makaveli.  The only reson untill the end of time was under the death row name is because deathrow own some of tupacs masters which he left behind when he died. Anyweasy this is a great album BUY IT
B00006IX0R|5.0|It has been a decade since Limerick's finest kids came into our stereos, our CD players, and our lives with their mystic, yet mellow 1992 debut of 'Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?.' Since then, it's been quite an emotional ride for The Cranberries. Throughout their, so far, ten years of surreal highs (Their epic LPs of the Stephen Street-produced 'Everybody Else...' and 'No Need To Argue,' their graceful comeback with 1999's 'Bury The Hatchet,'etc. etc.) and terrible lows (1996's bleak and uninspiring 'To The Faithful Departed' album and the emotionally-draining tour that followed that), Dolores O' Riordan, Noel and Mike Hogan, and Fergal Lawler have crafted out incredibly jangly-rocking, yet thought-provoking melodies from unfortunate love ('Linger' and 'I Can't Be With You'), to the Troubles in Northern Ireland ('Zombie'), to, even, September 11th ('New New York'), and self-discovery ('Ode To My Family' and 'Just My Imagination'). Their unique and beautiful blend of shimmering guitars, passionate bass and drum playing, and lush, (and quite [lovely]) Celtic-like vocals courtesy of O' Riordan, herself, The Cranberries provided an euphoric sound which would become a permanent etching in the soundtrack for our modern-day lives.<BR> Thus, what fine way to represent the band and their music than with their 20-song compilation. With anthemic songs that present hope, endurance, seriousness, with an infinite  yearning , 'Stars: The Best Of 1992-2002' is a very-class representation of timeless, brilliant songs.<BR> From their first album, which was a stunning and fresh start after recovering from the nauseous, hangover-like affects from bloated hair-metal bands, to their two new and best songs, the intense and uplifting 'New New York' and the rocking, dazzling beauty of 'Stars' (which I, thankfully, first heard it when I seen the band in concert in Chastain Park Amphitheatre in Atlanta, earlier this year. GREAT GIG!), The Cranberries' sound was, and STILL is, simplified, effective, and majestic, indeed.<BR> And sure, sure, their popularity may have decreased and their videos aren't being played on MTV (Anyway, does MTV STILL play videos!?:-) But nevertheless, The Cranberries may not be the most popular band in the world, but they are one the BEST bands in the world...and the reasons for that are in this magnificent compilation. An essential purchase for the big Cranberries' fan or the casual listener.
B00000AD94|5.0|This is what started it all. Where would we be if Neal Morse never made this record? It's a scary thought. No Spock's Beard. No TransAtlantic. No NDV. No good.<br />The album begins with the 15-minute quasi-epic, \\"The Light.\\" This song features all of the classic qualities of the Beard: piano-based melodies, repeated lyrical themes, instrumental grooves, Yes-influenced solos and goofy sounds effects. It also is a classic example of the Beard being serious and having fun at the same time. \\"I am senor Valasco / I drink my milk with Tabasco\\"?!? Those silly sons-of-guns.<br />\\"Go the Way You Go\\" is another good piece. This song has more Genesis influences, I believe. It also has some cool keyboard solos, and even more sound effects. \\"On the Edge\\" isn't the next track, but it is the shortest. Yet another good song, especially the bass part. And the bonus track is a live excerpt of the acoustic guitar duet in \\"The Doorway.\\" Neal and brother Alan learned how to play with each other, and this solo is solid proof of that. (Note: The Beard's live show is one not to be missed.)<br />Finally, \\"The Water\\" is quite possibly one of the best tracks SB has ever recorded. Years of discontent and sadness in Morse's life are summed up in these lyrics, especially \\"FU/I'm Sorry.\\" This 23-minute epic has so much emotion in it that it works as catharsis for Morse. And it must have done its job because they no longer perform the song live, saying that it doesn't feel right to play it. But it is still one powerful song. It is definitely the highlight of the album.<br />Historically, debut albums are usually hit or miss. (When Dream and Day Unite comes to mind.) One thing they are good at is displaying the band's influences. In The Light, classic prog bands such as Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd and a little ELP can be heard in these pieces. But mostly, a lot of originally is seen, mostly Morse's poppy-songwriting style combined with progressive overtones. Most of all, The Light gives a wonderful starting point from which the Beard is building their legacy. Way to go the way you go, boys.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|....when I saw it the first time in 1997!!! The only reason that this film gets 3 stars is because of Lara Flynn Boyle in a push-up bra. Let the droolin' begin boys.<br />Stay away from this one, not even worth a rental; your best bet is to find it on Kazaa and watch it for free.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I actually own the DVD, but if you are someone who prefers to listen to jazz vs. having to look at it with a dvd player this is a better choice for you. I prefer to listen to albuums through a cd player (dvd player)so I can carry them anywhere. Anyway, this is probably the best album she has released since &quot;Love Scences&quot;.
B00005RFAI|1.0|Pink was a hot, fierce, confident lil' thing when her 2000 debut CAN'T TAKE ME HOME came out. She was singing with soul and R&B/hip-hop grit, much like TLC, Mary J. Blige, and Monica. The only thing people found shocking or surprising was that Pink was white. Eventually, Pink got tired of singing R&B and being seen as a poser, so her second album is a hot mess of pop rock, new wave disco, and soul. Booo. Pink really shows us how fake she can be. She should have stuck to her R&B pop roots, since that's the music she built her name and fanbase on. Her lyrics are trite, and she surely doesn't seem to enjoy her youth much (some songs make her seem like she's a depressed old woman in her midlife crisis). \\"Get The Party Started\\", her hit which eclipsed all her other R&B hits, is catchy. And the soul-flavored R&B ballad \\"Eventually\\" takes me back to her old days. But the goodness ends there. Overall, Pink truly disappoints with this one. I'm still remembering her as the young, spunky and loveable R&B artist she was 2 and a half years ago.
B0000542D2|3.0|Seen martin lewis (one of the guys behind the making of this d.v.d.)in Chicago in August and he said since the Beatles company &quot;Apple&quot; does not own this film, the beatles will have nothing to do with it. That is why there are no new interviews with paul and ringo.Also, i think if Apple would have been involved, i don't think we would be seeing so many negative reviews. Look what Apple did with the Yellow Submarine D.V.D.Excellent 5.1 sound mxed at abbey road studios. The picture quality on the hard days night d.v.d. is all i can say that they did right. Please, Miramax, this is the Beatles.Hopefully, since this is a &quot;special edition&quot;, they can right their wrongs. But i'm not holding my breath. Bummer, because this d.v.d could have been so much better. I give the movie itself a 5, the d.v.d. a 2.

B00001NFCY|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. There is no other way to put it. There is not one song on this whole entire album that is weak in any way. The lyrics are full of symbolism and emotion. The most symbolic and religious song on the album is \\"Faceless Man\\", but so are \\"Wrong Way\\", \\"Say I\\", and \\"Never Die\\". And \\"Beautiful\\" talks about women who are beautiful on the outside but ugly on the inside. What an awesome cd!

B00005Q4CS|5.0|A powerful and graphic depiction of the horrific experience of addiction, Requiem for a Dream leaves the viewer shocked and painfully enthralled. Director Darren Aronofsky's genius shows throughout the film with his unique and arresting style of capturing the painful stories of his four protagonists, most famously in the specific story of Ellen Burstyn's obsessive and disintegrating character.  Critics argue that a viewer knows the end as soon as the movie begins -- that the lesson will be the tired \\"drugs are bad\\" after-school special message.  However, to dismiss this film in such a simplistic way deprives the viewer of the overwhelming experience of the film's engrossing story.  Each and every scene fills the viewer with emotion without fail, from terror to suspense to despair.  While film students may revel at the artistic use of various cinematic techniques, the amateur viewer appreciates each and every pan, split-screen and rapid-fire cuts that all serve a directly applicable purpose to the plot element they serve to illustrate.  The real message of this film, as Aronofsky himself says, is that hope itself can become the most dangerous of all addictions when it is allowed to dissassociate from reality.  Dark, dingy and desperate, Requiem for a Dream gives every moviegoer an unforgettable experience and for viewers like me, who love the sugarless realism of an unhappy ending, a stunning look into a brilliantly constucted cinematic world of misery.  Those viewers searching for a revelation about the dangers of drugs will not find it here.  However, those viewers seeking the experience of a brilliantly directed movie with an unforgettable story and haunting moments at every turn will see this nightmarish film as a dream come true.
B000066F6H|4.0|Wow. Before you could say &quot;Man, these Strokes guys are pretty good,&quot; along came another rock band to remind you that while the Strokes had just started, this band had been doing their thing for the better part of a decade. The Hives formed in 1993 with a sound that was decidedly punk, a wardrobe that was decidedly Beatles and a background that was decidedly Swedish. Led by the creative songwriting mind of musical genius Randy Fitzsimmons (supposedly a nonexistent person), the Hives' second full-length &quot;Veni Vidi Vicious&quot; is a fabulous blend of old, new and loud. From the totally rocking introduction &quot;The Hives -- Declare Guerre Nucleaire&quot; to the rants and raves of &quot;Supply and Demand&quot;, the Hives show off their fast-paced, loud-as-hell musical abilities to anyone daring enough to listen in. They even recognize the need to take a break now and again with the cool-down, oldie tune &quot;Find Another Girl&quot;. It seems the new musical trend known to me as garage-rock-revival is making it big here in the US.
B000066NW0|2.0|well i thnk that what avril was trying to do here is be \\"rebelius\\" and still make millions. and she did that by dresing as a skater/punk and singing as a prep. that way she apeals to everyone, right? not really. to me that sounds like reversed logic. <BR>her songs in thems selves could be much better but are generaly lisnable and easy to realate to, so what the problem? well one would be that she manages to confuse us with her melded styles. another is that we have no way to really classify her. so she goes as a poser. well luckily only \\"people magazine\\" made the mistake of calling her music punk (play that punk-ey music) <BR>what I'm attempting to say is, sure buy the CD,but expect rude coments.<br />some where i read that she sounded like gwen from no doubt. that make me laugh. i'de like to see her try and pull a song like \\"trapped in a box\\" and \\"oi to the world.\\"

It's time to bring in &quot;garage-rock-revival!&quot; Now, I can't claim to have paid attention to the music scene during the original reign of garage rock, but the Strokes' &quot;Is This It&quot; is an album truly deserving of the genre &quot;Pop/Rock&quot; because it sounds to catchy to be rock, but too hard to be pop. No, they're not &quot;saviors&quot;. They're just as good as the Hives or the White Stripes. But what the Strokes have going for them is a talented singer/songwriter and a band that look as if they've been pulled from the 70s. Unfortunately, &quot;Is This It&quot; came out a couple of years ago, so I can't put it on my Best of 2002 list. Still, it's a great album and I recommend it to anyone who's tired of anything on the radio.
B00006F7S4|3.0|this is a good album...perfectly enjoyable.  that's it.  there's nothing amazing about it, and if you never buy it, you're not missing anything.  like mutations, it's more notable because it's a refreshing change from his other work.  the cut-and-paste soundscapes of odelay and mellow gold grow tiresome and do not age well.  one day, i predict we'll look back on sample oriented music with laughter and perhaps distaste or even disgust.  this album just reminds me that it all seems to have been done before.  this is straight ahead mellow rock, with little bleeps and blips, and the obligatory nigel godrich glockenspiel tinkles.  there are some &quot;end of song&quot; noise moments, complete with screaming feedback, as if beck realized that we would not be able to last through the entire album without falling asleep.  it's hard to react too positively to this album after 2002 brought us flaming lips &quot;yoshimi battles the pink robots&quot; and wilco's &quot;yankee hotel foxtrot.&quot;  i would recommend this album only after you have bought those titles or if you've been wondering whether anything good has come out since hootie and the blowfish or matchbox 20.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This album collects together just 31 of his most popular recordings. It covers 1956-1977 - the years in which he was ever-present in the UK and US charts. I've heard these songs nany times before but never in such clarity and power. It's a revelation to me that he had sung these songs so well in the studio (or live- there's a slightly different version of \\"The Wonder Of You\\" included). The engineering originally, was allgedly, not the best, according to Elvis. But now, Elvis, his musicians and backing vocalists are revealed, gleaming from beneath the mud of the neglect. The engineers on this project had consulted with some of the original musicians, and even Elvis' ex-wife, and produced a sound that is probably how it really sounded in the studio. Their hard work with the tracks and the the music itself on this CD deserves the accolades. And, as for the singer, well, his sincerity  when it comes to interpreting virtually every song - his own or others -rings through like never before in these superb recordings.
B000069CWE|1.0|Most remix albums are one of two things: something to tide fans over until a new release is put out, or just one of the fulfilments on the band's record contract.  Not to mention most remix albums that are released can't live up to par of the album that they are remixed from (a few exceptions would be White Zombie's \\"Supersexy Swingin' Sounds\\" or Marilyn Manson's \\"Smells Like Children\\").  \\"Reanimation\\" is a remix collecton of Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" featuring remixes from a bevy of nu-metal musicians and hip-hoppers.  First off, \\"Hybrid Theory\\" was one of the most overrated and unoriginal albums I have ever had the displeasure of hearing.  It was never metal, it was wanna-be-heavy made for radio watered down rock with downtuned guitars, turntables, terrible drumming, and repetitive lyrics.  Since it was such a smash, a remix album didn't surprise me.  All of these remixes (or whatever you want to call them, but remixes is what they are and you all know it) are nothing special, no matter whose name is saddled with remixing it.  \\"Reanimation\\" is nothing more than a quick cash in for Linkin Park while they're recording they're next crowd pleasing album which is sure to sell 10 million plus copies no matter what.  Another thing is \\"Reanimation\\" carries the full price of a regular album.  20 tracks of remixes or not, I have seen other remix albums that have just as many tracks that are half the price of this, and after noting that now I am completely positive this is just a quick cash in attempt.  I even know some Linkin Park fans that aren't happy with this.  Hopefully more people will come to realize that this isn't \\"heavy metal\\" or \\"hard rock\\" (I love seeing pictures from LP's concerts in magazines and seeing kids with the devil ears in the air; that makes me laugh so much), this is musical fodder that is better left to be used as target practice in a skeet shoot rather than a CD.

B000068TPN|2.0|War movies must not be just entertaintment .They have to be made with more maturity and seriousness simply because they deal with history . We Were Soldiers is a decent effort by director Wallace to tell a part of the story of the Vietnam War . It's basic message seems to be this : both Vietnamese and Americans had great casualties , both of them suffered . Yet what it fails to do is to actually present the paranoia of war and the psychological situation those young soldiers found themselfs into . <br />   \\"This is a war we will never understand \\" says a voice at the beginning of the film and indeed it is . The US had send it's own kids to fight to an unknown country and to give their lives for a war taking place outside it's border , in a nation which didn't threaten the security nor the integrity of their homeland . Despite that though , the film has scenes of men dying on the battlefield while saying things like \\" save those codes... i'm glad i'm dying for my country \\" . These were young people full of prespectives and dreams who were facing the danger of not growing old , having children and live their lives they way they would want to , all for a war which on final analysis ... was not theirs . So how did they feel about being there ? Were they more patriotic or anxious and horrified ?<br />   It's been more than 20 years since Francis Ford Copolla had directed Apocalypse Now , the most horrific and challenging Vietnam story ever to be told . It hasn't even been a decade since Terence Mallick had made The Thin Red Line , one of the greatest war movies ever - a film which condemns war no matter who is fighting who - . We Were Soldiers is afraid to even touch subjects these films had deeply explored . Furthermore , Mel Gibson remains one of these few hollywood stars who are still unwilling to take a risk and play something else beside the hero or the cool guy while the Vietnamese share of pain is not even  being merely presented . It's understandable to want to honour the men of our country who lost their lives on the battlefield but what the world needs now is to actually face our history's mistakes and condemn war at every chance , even through blockbuster movies .
B0000013G9|3.0|Surprisingly, TLC remains as popular as they've always been, even after the tragic ending of Lisa Lopes. Nevertheless, the music showcased the full bloom of the beginning of the girl groups of the 1990's. Tionne, Rozanda and the late Lisa can always still hold their heads very high.<br />The 1994 album, CrazySexyCool, showed a very quick change in the style and music of TLC. They went from acting like the male Hip Hop artists of the time, including M.C. Hammer, and Dr. Dre, to showing a misty and incredibly dynamic change to the music. Songs like Waterfalls, Creep, and the erotic Red Light Special, still show a lot of promise in their legacy. In this record, Tionne shows the lead mostly all of the recordings, where on the previous album, the late Lisa Lopes was the head of the album. Nevertheless, the music was really all that mattered.<br />It still may come as a surprise, if TLC can still showcase the talents they've always maintained with all those corny pop acts like Destiny's Child, and Blaque. All that can still be displayed, is the music of TLC's legacy.
0380789035|5.0|American Gods is a wholly original novel, and one of the best I've read in a long time.  The story had me hooked from page two, and was quite unpredictable.  This one requires you to think a bit, which is fine by me.  The book has depth.  Shadow is a splendid character, and has some pretty intense demons.  After reading the also excellent Neverwhere, I still believe Gaiman has yet to hit his peak.  He's going to be great.
B00000J7S8|5.0|This is my first ever review for Amazon.com and I cannot start with a different thing. \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" is the only across-the-board 5-star non-classical CD I own thus far (in my book, of course).<BR>  I first learned about Diana Krall when this album was nominated for 1999 Album of the Year Grammy, in January 2000 (I usually check out Grammy-nominated albums). It was the moment this singer won me over.<BR>  She did not win that big Grammy, but went to claim Best Jazz Vocal Album and Al Schmitt took the honours (deservedly) for his trademark, immaculate sound. See, or rather listen to Shirley Horn's You're My Thrill as well.<BR>  On this album, Diana was taking a mid-way path between small combo intimate music featured on her earlier smashes, \\"All For You\\" and \\"Love Scenes\\" and more lush, but equally impressive orchestral setting, such as on \\"The Look Of Love\\". I think that \\"Love Scenes\\" is a little bit too flat and monotonous (\\"All For You\\" is better) and \\"The Look Of Love\\" may prove too much for some jazz purists with its sleek orchestras (but not for me, though).<BR>  \\"When I Look In Your Eyes\\" is perfect in every sense of word. Swinging yet soothing, each rendition is unmistakeably Diana's. Wonderful orchestral arrangements by Johnny Mandel (maybe the best arranger around) and bossa-nova touch make the classics like \\"Let's Face The Music And Dance\\" and especially \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" very fresh and sensual. You may have heard these tunes hundreds of times, yet with Diana you find something new in them.<BR>  From faster tracks, two of my absolute favourites are \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" and \\"The Best Thing For You.\\" Musicians like Russell Malone and John Clayton (and others, too) make this party an unforgettable affair.<BR>  There is no weak song on this album. Of all Diana's studio albums released between 1993-2001, this one may well be the most accomplished and most representative work of her career. The career that may well have its peak (or peaks) in the future.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I have been a QUEEN fan since 1974 with the exception of the FLASH GORDON album and the first 5 songs on HOT SPACE, QUEEN can do no wrong. For anyone new to the group who only know the \\"radio songs\\", this would be a great way to get aquainted with QUEEN. Besides the 70s hits, you have a great deal of songs that were big hits all over the world that didn't get the exposure they needed or deserved here in the US, and these songs ROCK!!! INNUEDNO,THE SHOW MUST GO ON, HEADLONG, I WANT IT ALL, HAMMER TO FALL are just some of the gems in this collection. Once familiar with this set, start with QUEEN and work your way up to MADE IN HEAVEN. Expirence the different styles, emotions and clever songs that four very talented men created. ENJOY!!!!

B00004VVNB|5.0|Anyone who compares this movie to the novel, especially in highlighting differences as a failure to \\"be true\\" to the authors' vision, is making a mistake.  The book and the film share a title, and some other elements, but the tone and even the conflicts are distinct.  Take each on its own.  While I encourage you to read the book, and  strongly encourage you to see the DVD, I hope you will appreciate the very different minds they each explore.<br />The world of the novel is noir-dark, universal, and consciously cynical.  Though folks only live to 21 (vs. 30 in the film), there are lots of doubters and many weird little subcultures, such as Molly's giant, or the \\"culture of one\\" who is the terrifying Box (yes, there is a Box in the film, but only some details, and the name, were kept to nod to the book; the Box in the movie is a machine acting on programming, dangerous but not evil, a contrast to the damaged human psychopath artist of the book).  Blade Runner has more in common with the novel Logan's Run than does this movie.<br />So, why do I love the movie so much?  It displays the mindless innocence of the subjects of ubiqitous fascism.  The children in the City of Man have known nothing else, are swaddled in this shallow, stifling cocoon of a society, without a history (there are no books or elders to carry history), and immersed in a pale, candy culture where no one creates anything.  The only signs of human endeavor are in the Runners, whose dissent makes them enemies of the State/City who must be killed, and in the Sandmen, who at least develop skills as hunters.<br />Logan's Run, the movie, therefore tells a story that is closer to the peril of many still-comfortable U.S. Americans, content (and able to) drown their doubts in busy pursuit of easy, vapid pleasures that discourage independent thought. Comforted by the assurance that the City will care for them and that the pale religion of the city promises the salvation of Renewal, and the chance to live life after healthy, silly, fun, worry-free life, the young people of the mall-city remind me of the blinkered folks of our culture who only see suffering rarely, and can change the channel if it threatens to awaken them from the padded cells of their colonized minds.<br />I love watching those sweet, dumb kids, Logan and Jessica, progress through the slow satori of this movie, as well as the classical mythic elements of labyrinths, secret doors, birth canals, underworld, pinnacle and other symbolic elements which are scattered all through the film, but which no other review here has yet mentioned.  These children, who seem to lack even fairy tales, traverse the same psychic landscape fairy tales illuminate in other cultures, but do so in real physical peril.<br />See this film, and critique the uneven directing and the dated look, but go ahead and explore the Hero's Journey (which myth famously informed Star Wars). That myth may be more relevant to those of us lucky enough to be in cyberspace in the form explored by Logan's Run.  For the priveleged (and if you are reading this, you are priveleged far over the majority of the world's folks), the risk of sleepwalking in the dreamworld of friendly fascism is very real.  The evil Empire of Star Wars is an open oppresser, inspiring rebellion; The City of Logan's Run, by contrast, is a mindless, benevolent dictator, inspiring nothing, assuring risk-free consumerism forever.
0345440900|5.0|This book truly helped me when I had my baby back in January 2002.  I didn't have anybody here to help me those first few months (my Mom lives in another state and my mother-in-law works all day)- I'm sure glad I found Tracy!!  Her advice is priceless and I've been buying this book for all the baby showers I've been attending!
B0000029GA|5.0|Okay...I am the type of person who believes that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I never question people's preferences when it comes to music or ANYTHING, but in this case I have to say that if you think this album is over-rated or wack...I'm sorry but you have NO idea what you are talking about.  This album is 100 percent pure hip-hop bliss...from start to finish.  The best lyrics I've ever heard combined with the best UNDERGROUND production ever.  If you ain't feeling this CD, you probably think Nelly is the best emcee ever.  This album is not about bling-blinging, or drinking moet, or flossing in your Benz...this about life in the projects...plain and simple...and absolutely poetic.  I bought this CD on the day it came out, and everytime I listen to it I am still amazed at how good it is.  Too bad this was Nas' only good album...after this he drifted in to crossover rap and never gained this greatness again.  I urge you...if you don't have this CD and you like REAL rap (not Nelly, or Jay-Z, or Cash-Money Wackanaires) please do yourself a favor and get this. Nas is absolutely relentless on this CD.  And if you already have Illmatic, and you appreciate its rawness, you should really check out \\"The Realness\\" by Cormega.  I would put that album second behind Illmatic as the greatest of all time.  <br />\\"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game, used to sport ballys and gazelles with black frames, now I'm into fat chains sex and tecs, fly new chicks and new kicks, Hienie's and Beck's\\"----NAS, from Illmatic

B00004W221|5.0|I read the book \\"Rudy\\" and found out that the movie left out a lot of valuable information.  However the movie was great also, but Rudy's relationship with his father and two older brothers in the book was an intense relationship.  After reading the book and seeing all of the obstacles that Rudy had to overcome to achieve his dream of playing football and attending school at Notre Dame it made me think.  I thought about my dreams and aspirations that I had set for myself when I was younger and what I was doing currently doing to achieve them or not doing.  However, what the message I got from the movie and the book were that if you don't have dreams you are not alive which I believe to be so true.  Dreams are what keeps us going and excelling in life despite all odds that are stacked up against us.

0393037010|5.0|Some years ago George Will wrote a column on this series, highly recommending it.  I read this book,  the first in the series, and I was hooked.  A few months later I had finished all twenty books, though I admit I did not read much else in that time.  A few months ago started rereading the series, and again found this novel to be a great read.  Last week I read the first few paragraphs to my wife, and completed the book a third time a few days later.<br />I really have little interest in the historical period, it's the characters and stories (typically based on real events) that drew me in.  The technical terms are really unnecessary to grasping the story, you can be as much of a lubber as Stephen Maturin himself and enjoy all of the book.  The characters are memorable, the book is rich in humor and the writing is superb.<br />I read all but the first book (this one) compliments of the local library, but I now own the entire series in hardcover.  Try the series.  This is the place to start.  If you don't enjoy it you've wasted one book.  If you fail to read this, however, you risk missing out on the most enjoyable series you can find.

B00003CXQY|5.0|This film is much lighter than most Disney films.  Yes, they're fun too, but most feel some obligation to act as though the story could be happening.  The Emperor's New Groove looks into the camera, winks at the audience, and plays by other rules.  <br />I'm not a big David Spade fan, but he is perfect as Cuzco.  John Goodman is both funny and endearing as Pacha.  Pacha's family is hilarious, and the scenes with his kid's show how funny a movie can be when it abandons reality and only lives by cartoon rules (i.e. no rules).  Eezma and Kronk are also very good.<br />Like all the best cartoons there is plenty of humor here for the adults, and my kids love the film as well.  Great movie, great DVD.  You can enjoy the 'normal' version, but the Ultimate Edition adds a good deal more, include a short quiz, jokes you won't see in the film itself, and lots of background.  It's good to know that Sting chose not to do the theme song because he felt he was too old, at fifty, and so they got...Tom Jones!

B000002BSV|5.0|After the dark \\"Dog man star\\" and after Bernard Butler quitting the band, what would (London) Suede do? Split?<br />No. The answer is this album, the third and definitive Suede piece. New memmbers (Richard Oakes, Neil Codling) and the old urban chronicles. Eight of the ten tracks would be rated as 5 stars, one deservers 4½ stars (\\"The chemistry between us\\") and one deserves 3 (\\"She\\"). And you can find all Suede music here: from glitter-rocks to make you yell in a disco club (\\"Trash\\"), to perfect ballads (\\"Saturday night\\"), passing through up-tempo chronicles (\\"By the sea\\"), arrogant descriptions of simple pleasures (\\"Lazy\\") and the delicious british cynicism (\\"Starcrazy\\", where singer Brett Anderson screams \\"VIOLENCE!\\" for nothing, during the song). All filled with the best guitars since The Smiths' Johnny Marr and with the traditional luxury that you always wait in a (London) Suede album. One of the 10 best albums of the 1990's.
B0000687L5|4.0|THE LEGEND OF 1900  has as its protagonist a man named D.B.T.D.L. 1900. The &quot;1900&quot; is indicative of the year he was born and found abandoned on a luxury ocean liner, the &quot;Virginian&quot;, after its passengers had disembarked in New York. Let it suffice to say that the other initials stand for the ship's crewman that discovered him, and the brand name on the produce crate in which he was lying.<br />The time frame of this film can be tricky at the beginning unless one pays attention. The &quot;now&quot; is, apparently, after WWII. After pawning his trumpet in an English hockshop, Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) begs to play it one last time. While doing so, the pawnbroker recognizes the melody as that played on a piano on an old record. He spins it for Max, who identifies the pianist as 1900, whom he met in 1927 when he (Max) signed aboard the Virginian as a band member. In a flashback, he recalls the story of 1900's birth, emphasizing that the man never ever left the liner to set foot on solid land. On being asked where he found the disk, purportedly the master copy of the recording session and the only one in existence, the shop owner says it was hidden in a piano that came off an old hospital ship berthed in the harbor. On going to the dock, Max recognizes the rusting hulk as the Virginian, which is in the process of being loaded with explosives designed to scuttle the vessel. Convinced that 1900 is still aboard and hiding, he insists on a search. Interspersed with this activity are more flashbacks to the 20s and 30s when Max played with 1900 in the ship's main ballroom.<br />THE LEGEND OF 1900 is not a perfect film by any means. The character of The Girl (Melanie Thierry) and her relationship with 1900 are left frustratingly underdeveloped. Sad-faced Tim Roth is wonderful as the enigmatic 1900, who is perhaps too inscrutable. (But, then, legends generally are, or they wouldn't be legends. Remember the old saw, &quot;Familiarity breeds contempt.&quot;) Without the monolog by 1900 towards the end when he explains himself to Max, the viewer would be left with precious little of the former to fathom. However, one thing is known for sure - 1900 is a phenomenal musical talent. He can play a melody on the piano, no matter how complex, after having heard it only once. He demonstrates this and more (wow!) during a &quot;dueling pianos&quot; session with Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams III), the &quot;inventor&quot; of jazz, who comes aboard for an Atlantic crossing just so he can challenge the famous upstart. And, in perhaps the film's most entrancing scene, 1900 plays the piano in the deserted ballroom while the ship rolls in the ocean swells. 1900 has unlocked the piano's anchor wheels, so the instrument glides serenely back and forth over the dance floor while managing not to hit anything until ... well, you have to see it.<br />Viewed as a tragic figure, the viewer will understand 1900 when he says, &quot;The world has passed me by 2000 people at a time.&quot;  The film is bittersweet to be sure, but well done. See it if you're looking for something on the slightly eccentric side of ordinary.thout the monolog by 1900 towards the end when he explains himself to Max, the viewer would be left with precious little of the former to fathom.

0060930349|4.0|I always hated American history classes in high school and college. It just seemed like one damned political argument after another...tarrifs, acts, bills, administrations...blah, blah, blah. My opinion changed after reading this highly entertaining and fast paced account of our history. There it is: warts and all. But how splendid and magnificent. It is not generally understood just how wealthy this nation was right from the beginning. As far back as 1750, the American standard of living was pulling ahead of the rest of the world, especially among yeoman farmers. The cast of characters is also very lively. You know the names, but their individual behaviour is marvelous to behold on the canvas of history. My biggest complaint is that Johnson gets his facts wrong in many places, especially when it comes to the War Between the States. He gets General Albert Sidney Johnston confused with General Joseph Johnston...with Old Joe getting killed at Shiloh!! Egad. He then states that R. E. Lee was of wealthy descent. Patently untrue. Lee's father left his family destitute and the young R. E. Lee was shuttled about between relatives. When he was sixteen, he had to seek a military career because he had no other means to support himself. There are other irritating details that flaw this book throughout, but on the whole his superb portraits of Lincoln, Jackson, Truman and other presidents along with men of culture like Emmerson is a skillfully accomplished measure of the writer's craft. His incisive portraits of post-World War II presidents are highly entertaining and informative. Those of us who lived through those years don't realize how much we missed. Johnson, an Englishman, gives us an unusual and absorbing glimpse into the great history of a mighty nation.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold succeeded in keeping my attention throughout the book. It deals with the impact a young girls murder has on the people that are left behind. And naturally one keeps reading to find out if the killer is finally caught. But that becomes of minor importance as the story passes the years after the killing. The idea of telling it from the girl that watches from heaven is perfect. although the book gives little clues on what heaven really looks like.
B00006690G|5.0|For a long time I considered the Marshall Mathers LP to be em's best work but, after listening to the Eminem show very closely I came to the conclusion that this takes the place of the Marshall Mathers LP because every single song is hot and the lyrics are witty and thought provoking even though I like the Marshall Mathers LP this album is superior.  I have had this album ever since it came out and I'm still not tired of listening to it and to me that shows the true meaning of a classic album.  If you like eminem or like rap music I suggest you pick this up because it is one of the best pieces of work from the genre of rap.
B00000JPH5|5.0|Jim Henson and George Lucas are a perfect match for this intriguing fantasy.  The film is a masterpiece; a beautiful work of artistry.  One of Jim Henson's best!  David Bowie is perfect as Jareth, the Goblin King.  Throughout the movie you want to hate his character and love him at the same time.  Jennifer Connelly portrays a young girl, Sarah, who escapes the world she lives in by reading fairy tales.  When she wishes that the Goblin King would come and take her baby brother away, he does.  And Sarah must solve labyrinth which leads to the castle beyond the goblin city to rescue her brother from the Goblin King.  Never a dull moment.
0140177396|1.0|This book was quite possibly the worst book i've ever had to read. No wait, the worst ever was The Pearl! What is wrong with Steinbeck? Why does he feel he needs to kill main characters? I would seriously recomend that you never read this book ever. If you have to for highschool, I feel extremely sorry for you. In cnclusion I just have to say George, just let Lennie tend the Frickin' rabbits and Kino, throw the pearl away already!
B000003S0D|5.0|The last album from KCs earliest phase, Lizard is one of my personal favorites. The guitar is sparse yet as good as Fripps fast-pickin' and trippy soloing gets.  Fripps orchestration creates more of an epic feel than youll get anywhere else in rock. Lizard is before KC started getting really experimental, and on it they still partially rely on the jazz backrounds of beautiful Mel Collins(flute+saxes) and the rest of the horns and woodwinds for lengthy straight up jazz-fusion improvs. And lets not forget Jon Anderson from Yes is a guest vocalist on the 22 minute title track. Definetly essential KC although thats not saying much since every album is must have.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is a Brilliant film....It's a who done it...a great murder mystery...<br />Taking advantage of a splendid cast, a sharply focused script and the fresh English setting, GOSFORD park emerges as one of the most satisfying of Robert Altman's numerous ensemble pictures, What makes the achievement of GOSFORD PARK all the more remarkable is that Mr. Altman is 76....The energy that crackles from the screen suggests the clear-sighted joie de vivre of an artist still deeply engaged in the world,an all-star British ensemble cast, the film recalls both THE RULES OF THE GAME and THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, with a midpoint shift to an Agatha Christie whodunit. In November 1932, a phalanx of moneyed guests arrives for a weekend shooting party at the estate of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas). Mary (Kelly Macdonald), a fresh-faced, naïve new maid accompanies the sniping Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), and is shown the ropes by the house's worldly head housemaid, Elsie (Emily Watson). While the masters engage in various financial and sexual intrigues upstairs, the world downstairs has its own curiosities--namely, the predatory valet to a Hollywood producer, Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe), and the mysterious, cagey servant, Robert Parks (Clive Owen). Mary soon discovers that the image of servants living vicariously through their masters is a false one, and that the upstairs-downstairs worlds are often shockingly interwoven. With GOSFORD PARK, Altman delivers a fascinating, blackly comic look at the treacherous yet poignant gamesmanship between the classes. This is fresh and original movie...very subtle funny...with, scandal, mystery, murder this is a must see.<br />Synopsis...from Gosford parks Offical Website:<br />Robert Altman, one of Americas most distinctive filmmakers, journeys to England for the first time to create a unique film mosaic with an outstanding ensemble cast.It is November, 1932. Gosford Park is the magnificent country estate to which Sir William McCordle and his wife, Lady Sylvia, gather relations and friends for a shooting party. They have invited an eclectic group including a countess, a World War I hero, the British matinee idol Ivor Novello and an American film producer who makes Charlie Chan movies. As the guests assemble in the gilded drawing rooms above, their personal maids and valets swell the ranks of the house servants in the teeming kitchens and corridors below-stairs.But all is not as it seems: neither amongst the bejewelled guests lunching and dining at their considerable leisure, nor in the attic bedrooms and stark work stations where the servants labor for the comfort of their employers. Part comedy of manners and part mystery, the film is finally a moving portrait of events that bridge generations, class, sex, tragic personal history  and culminate in a murder. (Or is it two murders?)Ultimately revealing the intricate relations of the above and below-stairs worlds with great clarity, Gosford Park illuminates a society and way of life quickly coming to an end.estate to which Sir William McCordle and his wife, Lady Sylvia, gather relations and friends for a shooting party.

0679735909|5.0|I haven't much followed the writings about this novel, but I noticed that none of the reviews you publish remark on Byatt's outrageous boldness: she creates excerpts of poems, long excerpts, having already told the reader that they command the careers of *armies* of scholars 150 years later.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Christopher Nolan's superbly-constructed mystery has the advantage over average thrillers with a startingly- original plot. The whole &quot;backwards&quot; premise works amazingly well, and is one of the best ideas ever devised for a film, reminiscant of PULP FICTION. Guy Ritchie is Sammy, a man who loses his short term memory when his wife is murdered and he gets attacked. Joe Pantiliano (THE MATRIX) is Lenny, a guy who may, or may not be Sammy's friend. The search for the elusive &quot;John. G&quot; provides for some chilling moments. Sammy's condition forces him to tattoo himself with notes like &quot;Never answer the phone&quot;, which racks up the tension and pushes the limits of audience's cerebral limitations. One of those films which you have to watch two or three times to fully understand it and get the whole idea, it's endless in it's creative concepts, leaving the viewer surprised and somewhat confused. Director Nolan does the best with the inventive tricks and piecing together the plot machinations. And extra kudos for the editor, not to mention the brooding score throughout the film's running time. In short, it's a fantastic film, and deserves to be placed high in the great &quot;Film Noir&quot; masterpieces.
B000059WOD|4.0|Ok, to start off this review, I'll correct what Amazon put: there is NO bonus disc on this. Only 2 bonus tracks, \\"My December\\" and \\"High Voltage\\". Now that that's clear, let's move on...<br />Linkin Park's debut album, \\"Hybrid Theory\\", was the best-selling album of 2001, and my favorite album, ever. I liked every song, so I had to buy this album. I payed 35 ... dollars for 2 songs. Stupid? Yes. But, at the time, I didn't have a CD-burner, and I didn't know that the \\"One Step Closer\\" single also had the 2 bonuses, for 1/3 the price. But, I bought it, and I'm happy. Let's start off with \\"High Voltage\\", shall we? I give it a 4/5. Why not a 5? Because I HATE rap. I can stand rap-rock, which is what you will find on every track on the normal album. But, this is almost a straight-up rap song. Chester hardly sings (the part where he does is the best part in the whole song), and the only music is coming from the turntables. But, for some reason, instead of giving this a 2 or a 3 (or even a 0), I give it a 4. Not to suck up to LP, but because I like it, even after all I just said. Now for \\"My December\\". It's the more popular bonus track, and if you've ever seen Linkin Park live, you've probably heard this song, because they more-than-often play it. And, like \\"High Voltage\\", it's not typical Linkin Park. In this one, Chester pretty much sings the whole song. And, also like the last one, there's no member of the band playing their instruments except Joe Hahn. In this one, he makes his \\"beats\\", but it's also covered with a beautiful piano. I don't know if it's because I got it around Christmas or what, but, for some reason, this song DOES remind you of it. 5/5, b!tch.
0743420373|4.0|This was an excellent book. Although I would say that it depends if you buy into their definition of wealth. Most of North america defines wealth in dollars vs. this book defines it as NET WORTH and provides an equation as to how much net worth you should have based on your age and how much you make.<br />I found that many of the points the author makes was true and it a provides an alternative outlook to wealth, contrary to what the media portrays. <br />Some things that I disliked about the book is that it primarily deals with people who are in the middle income or higher bracket. It does not deal with lower income folks who would probably benefit more from advice.<BR>It also does not deal with the wealth distribution of all of north america. it primarily deals with caucasions. I did not see any ethnic minorities listed. <br />Other than those picky details, the book was quite well written. I liked that the results were based on tests results and not just mumbo jumbo.

0761957553|5.0|The is the best SPSS book I have ever read, and I think I've read them all! It goes beyond the basic beginner's text, and yet I think new SPSS users, and new Stat students would also find this book understandable and useful. Field's explicit and well organized descriptions and explanations of the theory, methods,diagnostic steps, and interpretation of output for various statistical procedures are fantastic, and he has a wry sense of humor that reminds us that reasearch can actually be exciting and fun (honestly!). I know I will use this book for years to come, and will buy new editions as they are printed.
B000068QY7|4.0|After the schizophrenic offering that was Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants, its good to see Oasis once again making a strong, cohesive album.  The arrogance we all love remains with songs like The Hindu Times and Hung In A Bad Place.  But the highlights are most definitely Little By Little and Stop Crying, though there is something to be said about little ditties like Songbird and She Is Love.  Those tunes remind us a bit of the band's Wonderwall roots, but really go into a far more emotional area.  This album isn't quite as confident as their first two albums, but it seems that the band is willing to evolve their sound, and the fans are the ones who benefit from that.  If you like straight-ahead rock and roll from the heart and soul that is free of gimmicks, this is a great album.  Too bad it will fly under the radar of the US charts and critics, most of whom are unable to understand where Oasis are coming from.  Oasis aren't about to kiss up to the establishment to succeed.  The pretender fans have moved on to whatever may be the flavor of the week.  That leaves the true Oasis fans to enjoy this latest album.
B00000IQW5|4.0|Richard Dreyfuss is a pilot, and kind of a wild card when it comes to his fire fighter flying.  This concerns the people around him, girlfriend Holly Hunter and best friend John Goodman, but Dreyfuss shruggs it off because this is what he does.  Finally Hunter convinces him he should take a job in Flat Rock, Colorado training pilots to do what he does.  Unfortunately he never makes it to Flat Rock, at least not in the flesh.  Not trying to give too much away, Dreyfuss comes back as a sort of guardian angel, forced to deal with two things: his love for Hunter and his duty to a young pilot she falls for.<br />Always is a well made picture.  From Spielberg we expect nothing less, though I think his name hinders this film**.  The cinematography and the score are excellent as in all his films, as are the action sequences involving the planes.  However, the acting is the strongest part of this film.  This is the kind of role Dreyfuss shines in.  His fusion of wit and sincere emotion is wonderfull and he delivers some difficult monologues which would seem trite is lesser hands.  Holly Hunter and John Goodman are excellent as the people dealing with his loss.  Also Audrey Hepburn makes her final screen appearance in two scenes as an angel (how fitting).   <br />**I have this theory about Always.  It was almost universally panned by critics, but I think the criticism is directed more at Spielberg than at the film.  Certainly Spielberg has made better pictures, and perhaps this film was made on a grander scale than it needed to be, but I think if any other director had done this film it would not have received so much scrutiny.  But, I also believe in the hands of a lesser director this movie would not be as good.  Always combines action, humor, genuine sorrow, and happiness , and it combines them well, which is no small achievement.  Spielberg made a good film, let it go.
B000002BQK|5.0|This is the best album, in my opinion, that I've ever heard.  Every song is just pieced together so well and Mariah has never been more candid.  Every song is so personal that with this album you get to know Mariah more than you ever did.  The ballads are strong, beautiful, and emotional.  While the upbeat songs are fun, cute, with strong beats.  I've never been more proud of an artist.
B000067CPX|2.0|Ignore all the self-delusional folks giving this CD five stars.  It's not even close to worthy of 5 stars.  There's a handful of decent tunes on it.  The rest is filler, some of it quite poor.  Save your money and pick up one of their earlier works.  They're much more fun.
0316666343|5.0|Wow!  I read this book and in no time at all was I finding it hard to put down.  The more I read the harder it was to set down.  This author really captures the sincerity of a young girl who is raped and murdered. She takes you on an unforgetable journey through the lives of the Salmon family. I would recomend this book to be part of any high school reading list or list of books to read for pleasure.  A must have in my home library.  This is a book that you will read time and time again, I know that I have.
B00005T33W|5.0|I watched this movie only after it was released on video and because my brother recommended it so highly.  I had absolutely no idea what the movie was about, apart from that it was a comedy, so what I got was a pleasant surprise when much of the comedy here is not only biting but tinged with loneliness and despair.  The film follows two girls, Enid (Birch) and her best friend Scarlett Johannson, as they graduate from high school and slum it through the summer vacation.  Playing pranks on the boring people of the Nowheresville where they live Enid suddenly finds herself attracted to an older man (Buscemi) who collects records obsessively.  Gradually she finds herself leaving her best friend behind for this older man and discovering that slumming it isn't a possibility for the rest of your life.<br />It's difficult to sum up exactly what the movie is about other than to say that it's basically about life, love, hope, despair and tragedy.  However, the caustic comedy lends this an edge that few other films have, not to mention a sometimes overwhelming honesty that is often incredibly moving.  Despite being billed as a comedy (and, indeed, it is very funny at times - in particular in its comments about modern art) this is really more of a drama with comedy in it.  The performances are all top notch, and Thora Birch really sets herself up as the next big thing with a beautifully understated performance that is well matched by the likes of Johannson, Buscemi and the fantastic Illeana Douglas, in a small but instantly recognisable role.<br />The thing with this kind of movie is that it's intelligent, and certainly doesn't belong to the 'American Pie' ilk of teen movies, but in fact is a much more mature little flick that is destined to become a cult classic given enough time.  Sure there are parts of it that are slow, but the emotional weight of the movie is undeniably, with an ending that is either hopeful or tragic given your point of view.  It only really hits you a fewdays later how good this film really is, and speaking as someone who watched it during the summer vacation before I went to university, it sums up perfectly the fears, dreams and hopes that becoming an adult entails.
B000059XUP|1.0|First of all,<BR> The Original movie was great but City Of Angels just went too far. Though the The Crow saga itself is Fantasy, This went far beyond the genre.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I'm not a person who normally listens to jazzy music, but I was drawn to Norah by her &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; video. I love her style and her voice--sweet and smoky, someone you'd like to have sing you to sleep. <br />I don't normally listen to country, but I like the country touch on &quot;Lonestar&quot;. You can hear her Indian roots on &quot;I've Got To See You Again&quot;. Other highlights are the first single &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, the title track &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, and &quot;Nightingale&quot;.<br />I honestly don't see anything bad about this album. It's great mellow music.

B00005NWM3|2.0|Why on earth Nickelback are being credited for a grunge rival is beyond my apprehension. Their shows featuring pyrotechnics, and leather trousered rock posturing, brings to mind that famous Cobain phrase.<BR>There's no doubt they have the ability to craft catchy riffs and sing along melodies, but you get the feeling their trying too hard to be too many things to too many people. The radio freindly guitar licks appeal to the wannabe-grungers who find Alice In Chains and Nirvana too raw, and the attempted angsty lyrics appeal to the rebelious and disillusioned kiddies.<BR>In reality, the riffs are simple power chords, (getting tedious very quickly) and the lyrics are overly narrative and lacking in any real poetic mystery or meaning.<br />In short Silver Side Up is rock by numbers.<br />An excellent quote from a Radio DJ on Nickelback: <BR>\\"It's bizarre to mention Nickelback in the same sentance as Nirvana. Kurt would be ricocheting off his coffin lid.\\"

B00000DCER|5.0|This CD is absolutely incredible. Think of it as a regular 'Best Of' with a little something added. &quot;I'm in the Mood&quot; with Bonnie Raitt and &quot;The Healer&quot; make this CD a must have by themselves. The recording is crisp and clear and the track selection is diverse. I even went so far as to use this CD when demoing new speakers because it's so great.<br />I also recommend BB King's Deuces Wild. It is very much in the same idea as Best Of Friends, although 'Friends is ever so slightly better.
B00006J9OT|4.0|This is a nice recording with some new material and much that has been released on earlier recordings although this version is &quot;live&quot; so audience applause is included.  A &quot;must&quot; for Krall fans since her piano playing is superb and the other musicians work especially well with her on this recording.  I'm delighted that &quot;Fly me to the Moon&quot; is included since I loved her version in concert.
B000008B01|5.0|In my opinion, this is probably Gilberto's finest work. His playing is so spare and seemingly simple, but really so intense. His vocals are just above a whisper yet he manages to swing and exude so much emotion. The recording quality is also excellent. You simply must hear this music to understand how enriching the album is.
B000002JOH|5.0|By far one of the defining albums of modern heavy metal, \\"Vulgar\\" as it's known to us fans, was the culmination of the old and the new.  Traces of the brilliance of \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" and foreshadowing to \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" can be seen on this album in many places.  \\"Walk\\" is classic Pantera and to this day are still the most requested songs in concert.  \\"This Love\\" is the best anti-love song out there, and is truly amazing live, trust me I've seen these guys three times, and it get's better each time I hear it.  This is the album that put them on the map, and it couldn't have come at a better time... While music like this will never see any airplay nowadays, it is great, and if I were you, I wouldn't wait to hear it in that medium.  Buy this album!!!

630542845X|5.0|FINALLY SOMEONE MADE A MOVIE ABOUT THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT AND THAT SHOWS HOW LIMITLESS WE ARE! It also demonstates how we behave when someone is different from us.  I would encourage every person to sit down and watch this with their children.  Explain to them the importance of LOVE and seeing and feeling from another point of view.  In all of the things that occur to hurt the main character Powder, he never demonstates any evil or pain back.  This is a definite must see....Don't miss this movie!...
B000003CKH|5.0|I remember when this album came out, i heard the distance on the radio about one million times and eventually i bought the Cd. and then it sat on my shelf until one day in an effort to listen to some thing new, i just poped it in and played it from start to finish. I was subsequently blown away. i couldn't believe my ears, the was that they took rock and added real emothin and horns in a very unska-like way was awesome, this whole album is fantastic, from frank sinatra to sad songs, if you like cake then you should have this album, it is very similar to their current stuff, but more stripped down and somehow better.
0195073401|3.0|I own all of the 'major' graduate-level texts on micro, so I thought I would weigh in here.<br />The four major competitors and their strengths/weaknesses:<br />Kreps - Too chatty and not enough rigor.  Very, very good for the intuition of game theory.  Probably the most entertaining book, but we ain't doing this for entertainment, are we?  Good as a supplement, NOT as a text.<br />Varian - Excellent for basic producer/consumer theory.  The best in the business for these topics.  Should be the 'core' book for the first semester of the Micro sequence.  Weak in game theory.  The only text that can be realistically utilized for self-study.<br />MWG - Great for the mathematics of game theory.  Currently the best source (of these four books) of material on decision-making under uncertainty (though it is still fairly wretched in this regard).  Most complete of the texts.  Should be used as the 'core' book in the second semester of the first-year micro sequence.  Terrible for producer/consumer theory (unnecessarily and insanely mathematical and terse on these topics).  I keep this text handy, as I deal with game theory in my research.<br />Reny/Jehle - Supplementary text at best.  Second-best to Varian for producer/consumer theory.  The worst at game theory.  The best thing about it is the mathematical review chapter.  I rarely look at it.<br />If you are going to go through the first year of micro sequence, make sure you have Varian and MWG (even if, for some reason, they are not used as your text(s)).  The others are just supplements.

B00003CXAY|5.0|After reading a few reviews, I'm a bit confused, but I enjoy this 1.85:1 LBX because Ron Fricke's photography is all-consuming. I, too, saw this in theatres (\\"Koy\\", had to wait for \\"Pow\\" on DVD). The best thing about these DVD's is the side-shows, namely, the documentary interviews with Reggio & Glass. The films are riveting, and speak for themselves. One important thing Reggio said in the interview is not to ask why you're watching these films, but to relax and let them take you in. Reggio had an idea, and ran with it.  \\"Koy\\" was mostly centered in the American West, and, to me, basically said that what God has created is still there but man's already changing his ideas about how to make it better. Reggio also said that \\"Pow\\" takes place in the Southern Hemisphere, though most of the locations were Egypt, Nepal, Hong Kong, etc. The most stunning thing about this second film is the joy of life that surrounds these \\"backward\\" cultures. Who's to say what's \\"backward\\"? The important lesson is that technology could destroy eons of precious culture that exists simply because man hasn't been around to screw it up. Indeed, the photography in \\"Pow\\" (by Graham Berry & Leonidas Zourdoumis) seems to focus on brilliant colors and has less of the fast-forward stuff used in \\"Koy\\" by Fricke (suggesting that these are more relaxed cultures). The photography in both is exquisite, as is the music of Philip Glass (though it was more computer generated in \\"Koy\\", and a bit repetitive). My biggest argument with the DVD would be that I've been interested in some of the locations, and a commentary track would've been appreciated. These are films of great importance and influence. Reggio's first idea was sponsored by Coppola, long a fan of independent ideas. The second was by Coppola and Lucas, and I noticed that Soderbergh is mentioned as co-producer of the third, \\"Naqoyqatsi\\", as yet unreleased. Since \\"Koy\\", I've noticed the Reggio/Fricke influence in many of the commercials on TV. (Yes, I watch TV!).I like these films; they're thought-provoking and, somehow, visualize ugliness in the most beautiful way. Let them take you away.I watch TV!).I like these films; they're thought-provoking and, somehow, visualize ugliness in the most beautiful way. Let them take you away.
B00004Z459|5.0|Before I bought this CD I thought Linkin Park was just another garage band. I was SERIOUSLY wrong. This has got to be the greatest CD I have heard. With songs like Crawling, Points of Authority, and In the End, you have a perfect combination of rap and rock. I highly recommend this CD. But be warned, this is not for people who like to listen to music on the lowest volume. Buy this and enjoy a musical masterpiece.

0887306667|5.0|If your marketing plan has failed, then the chances are that you have not adhered to several of the 22 laws which are described in the clear and concise wording on 132 pages in this book. Each law or chapter is usually about five pages long, which requires only a short attention span to read it quickly. I do not recommend reading the book in one evening but to read a chapter and then reflect how these laws effect your company or products.<br />I will only list those laws that I found most important for me:<br />Law 3.) The Law of the Mind - It is better to be first in the mind than to be first in the marketplace. Examples of this are the personal computer market with MITS Alistair 800 being the first in the marketplace; Apple was the second in the marketplace but first in the mind of the people. The same example is shown with  different companies such as Remington Rand and IBM.<br />Law 4.) The Law of Perception - Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of perceptions. You can have a much better product than your competitor but perception wins out most of the time over product. A great example of this is the battle of the imported japanese car market of Honda, Toyota and Nissan as well as the soft drink war between Coca-Cola and Pepsi.<br />Law 12.) The Law of Line Extension - There is an irresistable pressure to extend the equity of the brand. One of the best chapters of this book explains how a winning product is turned into a loser by creating a spin-off version of the original product. Marketing managers continue to make this fatal mistake today of taking a successful brank like Coke, then creating Cherry Coke, Coke Classic, Caffine Free Coke etc., Engaging in line extension dilutes the original successful brand and the new version will never recoup the market share lost by the leading product. In the end there is an overall market share drop for the entire brand. Other examples of this is IBM's flirtation with the personal computer market, which was already dominated by the Apples, Commodores and Ataris. <br />The book is very condensed and I am sure a lot of the business scenarios depicted are more complex than they appear. Yes the book is rather old but a lot of these theories still have held true through the internet boom and bust cycle experienced over the last several years. <br />All people in the field of marketing should have these laws chiseled into their crainium somewhere.
B00005QIPH|3.0|There's nothing bad about this CD, but I can't say that I can see nearly enough good about it to justify the hype, and certainly not the frequent comparisons to VU, the Ramones, etc.  For that matter, I don't think they're really in the same league as the White Stripes.  So, basically, it's cool sounding stuff, but no great songs, nothing to quit your job and become a freak over.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Out of the possible 5 stars, this one deserves a 6. There are so many classics here. Everyone has heard at least one song on disc one and the other discs feature great songs too. The only bad thing is disc 3 isn't a &quot;hits&quot; disc, more of a compilation of rarer material. All in all, it's a great buy, worth every penny.
B000068CNX|5.0|Finally!!  We can get all the episodes of Friends possible!  This is my all time favorite show and I'm so glad that WB has decided to release all the shows on DVD.  I really hope they continue to release all the seasons so I can see any episode I want and more. Every episode is full of laughis and the writers and creaters have really made this the best sit-com ever!  This Collection is worth the price and will be a great addition to your collection.
B0000020C4|5.0|This Les Mis disc preserves the finest performance of this glorious score. Recorded in the Royal Albert Hall during the 10th anniversary concert, it brings together a true dream cast of Les Mis veterans to present the score in all its glory. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under the expert guidance of David Charles Abell give their fullest support to the cast, just like the powerful ensemble chorus. And the excellent acoustics of the Albert Hall show up on this recording to enable the listenere to lend an ear to the score.<br />The principals make up a star-studded roster of Les Mis performers past and present, and they shine in their roles while retaining the art of interacting with one another just as they have been doing in their respective casts. Heading the principals in Colm Wilkinson's excellent Valjean. Although Wilkinson's recent recorded performance was on the Broadway album in 1987, he has matured a lot into his role and has solidly maintained his touch with the character. The same should be asid about Philip Quast's Javert. Like Wilkinson, Quast shows his maintenance of his touch with his character, but Quast sings with power and energy, and with more electricity than on his previous portrayal due to the fact that this is a live performance. Ruthie Henshall makes as excellent a Fantine as Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway the sleazy Thenardiers (the former having mellowed tremendously from the original London cast), and the Eponine of Lea Salonga - Miss Saigon herself - adding the final icing on the cake. But special mention should also go to Michael Ball for his ever-sensitive portrayal of Marius, which shows him, like Wilkinson, Quast, Armstrong and Judy Kuhn as a sweet-voiced Cosette, as firm and solid in his role. His rendition of Empty Chairs at Empty Tables is heartbreaking and moving enough to make you cry. And as for Michael Maguire's Enjolras, he may be a little bit of a far cry from Anthony Warlow's headstrong performance, but he begins Do YouHear the People Sing? with a hushed pianissimo tinged with blind revolutionary fervour. The children - Hannah Chick and Adam Searles - are worth complimenting, as are the rest of the excellent and headstrong students.<br />This recording of Les Mis has all the intensity of a live performance. Although the recording is heavy on voices and may have a little bit too much applause, the electricity of the actual live show as shown in the West End and on Broadway is ably caught here. And I also ought to say that this recording has been mixed well, due to the ever-expert guidance of master engineer David Hunt. Although the track list states that the speeches are included on the CD, the listener is more than compensated with the finale medley of the Bring Him Home instrumental, Do you hear the People sing? and One Day More. Apart from capping such an electrifying, if slightly incomplete, performance of this wonderful score, it allows the listener to feel how special this performance is, seeing that this is a tenth-anniversary performance of the score.<br />On the whole, I would say that this is just about as excellent and memorable a Les Miserables performance we are ever to get, and it serves two purposes. Apart from being a document of a milestone in the development of the musical, it also serves to be the first choice for any beginning Les Mis collector. The accompanying booklet is packed with a full listing of the cast and orchestra members, and reminiscences from the creators of the show, not to mention photographs from the various productions worldwide and captions from the libretto.
B00005NTN5|5.0|The Wachowski Brothers are a little like Steven Spielberg. They have begun their career as filmmakers with a really good exercise of suspense thriller, like Spielberg did with \\"Duel\\". Then, like him, they have ended up in Hollywood and made a series of commercial and technically unpersonal films. So forget about \\"The Matrix\\", which is just a mixing of too many elements of Asian cinema (John Woo, kung-fu, and Japanese mangas - \\"Ghost in the Shell\\") in a Hollywood production, and let's concentrate on the independent movie this review is supposed to be about.<br />\\"Bound\\" tells the story of two beautiful but greedy lesbians, Violet (Jennifer Tilly, \\"The Bride of Chucky\\") and Corky (Gina Gershon, \\"Showgirls\\"), who decide to rob the lover of the first one. Corky, who's a crook, just got away from prison and of course, she's the one who gets the idea. Her plan is machiavelic and requires great precision. Their victim is played by an extraordinary Joe Pantoliano (not Patliano, Mr. Deffley), who'll be back as treator Cypher in \\"The Matrix\\", four years later. He's Cesar, and his job is clean drug money for a mobster played by John P. Ryan (\\"Runaway Train\\"). Pantoliano plays his character with incredible intensity; he totally invests himself in his fooled character (WHERE... IS... MY... MONEY?), always run around and around by the two witches, and makes an amazing performance which'd have deserved at least an Oscar nomination. When Corky takes the money out of Cesar's suitcase without moving the case, replacing the money with old newspapers, the story gets tough and the massacre begins. Confidence and trust between the two girls mix with treason and confusion between them, Cesar and the mobsters, and the whole keeps on in a bloody and dark ambiance until the final climax.<br />The Wachowski Brothers prove, with their first film, that money is the first source of violence and death in our societies. They do it with a surprising talent, ability and competence. They also prove their uncontestable technical and artistic knowledge. Their story is really original: here the usual couple of gangsters is replaced by a couple of lesbians and the story is not the one of a runaway; it entirely takes place in a closed space, managing to get powerful characters involved in it. The result is highly interesting and intense.<br />After watching this movie, we can think that it's too bad that the Wachowski Brothers didn't do like Quentin Tarantino, that they didn't keep their independent status. Because \\"Bound\\" can very easily be compared to \\"Reservoir Dogs\\". By getting completely involved in Hollywood, they lost their cult status and let themselves get overwhelmed by the huge success of noisy and hi-tech \\"The Matrix\\".

B0000584V3|5.0|This is a very cool album, no doubt, but after all the hype and praise it received, I was concerned that it would be a bit of a disappointment, and it turns out I was right, at first. This is a very good album, no doubt, but it didn't match my expectations at first. Now that I've owned it for a couple more weeks I like it even more.<br />This is definitely a Metal album, but it's style is completely different from most metal. I'm not even referring to the heavy use of acoustic instruments and the progressive structures. The riffing style on this album is completely different from the NWOBHM/Thrash standard. They are generally less chord and groove oriented, with a much greater emphasis on the atmosphere and texture. The guitars are always very dense and nicely layered as well. They also have fewer classically styled guitar solos. The drumming is also generally slower paced and a bit less intense than on most metal albums. So i guess I'm just saying that if you buy this album expecting it to have 8 ...And Justice For Alls and Travel In Stygians you might be disappointed, because you won't find any at all. Still, it's well worth looking in to for any fan of Metal.<br />This album has only 8 tracks but lasts a solid 67 minutes. Considering that 1 of the tracks is just a brief acoustic interlude the average length of the actual songs on this album is a bit over 9 minutes.(Though this is quite restrained compared to some of their earlier stuff) Every song, with the exception of Harvest, consists of at least a couple of different movements, changing from acoustic quasi-folk to crushing metal, as well as from death-metal roar to a gentle, high pitched clean vocals. Sadly, this is essentially the only major dichotomy on the album.(I probably misused \\"Dichotomy\\". Too late to turn back now Dammit!!) Within each of these styles their isn't a terrible variation in tone or tempo, other than that at some points they have electric and acoustic guitars going at the same time. It's almost all fairly mid-paced, or I should say it feels mid-paced, because it generally isn't terribly energetic sounding, which is fine, because thi suits the mood they are trying to evoke, which is quite dreary through out the whole thing, though the electric and acoustic parts are dreary in quite different ways. The songs also occasionally get a bit repetitive, as one riff is occasionally repeated a bit too much. I've grown to like the Death growl quite a bit more over these weeks. I still think using the clean vocals a bit more would be nice, but the growls are still pretty cool. So, after all this, there isn't a too much variation on this album, but it all flows together very well, and is very cohesive.<br />There really aren't any weak songs on the album. The Leper Affinity is a pretty good opener. It overuses the death-metal growl but has good instrumentation, and a cool somewhat softer part towards the end. Bleak is better, though quite similar, but with more soft parts. Harvest is very interesting, because it is done completely in the softer, primarily acoustic style. It provides an excellent contrast to the heaviest stuff. The Drapery Falls is probably the single best track, with the greatest number of stylistic variations, and some of the best vocals. The last track of particular note is the title track. It sadly lacks any clean vocals, but has more awesome instrumentation. I should also point out the the lyrics on this album are generally very good. They lack metal cliches, and don't waste your time trying to offend you.<br />So, this album is very cool, and all of you should buy it.almost all fairly mid-paced, or I should say it feels mid-paced, because it generally isn't terribly energetic sounding, which is fine, because thi suits the mood they are trying to evoke, which is quite dreary through out the whole thing, though the electric and acoustic parts are dreary in quite different ways.

B000067CPX|4.0|I heard this album and immediately fell in love with it.  Its true that this album is a very different and melodic venture, far different from any of the other GREAT albums the peppers have made so far. But it is still has Anthony's amazing vocals, Flea is not as noticiable, but his presence is felt throughout the album.  John's return to the band feels even more solidified on this effort than in Californication.  Any true Peppers fan will truely enjoy this CD. ps The Zypher Song is one of my favorites, even though it is on the radio 5 or 6 times an hour. Go get this one, you wont be sorry.
0609610570|5.0|I've read a lot of business books. Usually they all say the same thing.  Execution was different.  It completely changed my thinking. I run a small-medium size software business.  Like everyone these days our profits have been way down in the last 2 years. Morale was suffering. We had meeting after meeting trying to think up the next great product, how to improve our marketing. When I read Execution it all started to gel. We had lost our focus.  We were still thinking all that New Economy hype. What we really needed to do is what Bossidy calls &quot;creating a culture of execution&quot; at the office.  I made everyone in our office read the book.  I even gave one to our secretary.  I followed the book's advice and called a meeting outlining changes we had to make. Within weeks I could see a difference in our productivity and morale.  We're all getting more engaged in goal-setting and focusing on achieving those goals.  I really owe it to this book. Who knows, maybe some day we'll match Bossidy's golden numbers!&quot;
B000002HPV|5.0|Try hard to find an artist who has tested the boundaries of what is viewed as convential music as much as Bjrk.  Her unique sense of beauty is fleshed out in her best album to date, &quot;Homogenic.&quot;  Though previous works such as &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; are stunning in their own right, the lush strings and emotional vocals of &quot;Homogenic&quot; make it stand out among the rest.  The album's outstanding tracks include &quot;Joga,&quot; &quot;Unravel,&quot; and &quot;All is Full of Love.&quot;  And Bjrk does not disappoint, as her two later releases &quot;Selmasongs&quot; and the stunning &quot;Vespertine&quot; stand out as two of the most amazing pieces of musical art to come out of the nineties.  For those who are just getting into Bjrk, they should probably wait until November 5, 2002, when a collection spanning her solo career to date is released.
B0000027RL|5.0|In order to grasp why Pearl Jam's debut album is so wonderful, you need to hear some history.  Many people believe that Kurt Cobain single-handedly invented the grunge genre and all other bands to come out subsequently were just followers.  This is one of the most ridiculous mainstream beliefs in the music industry.  It's very possible that Pearl Jam created the movement that took over America in the early nineties (grunge is a dirty word).  2 members of PJ were in Green River, a mid 80's band that also featured members of Mudhoney.  After releasing some albums, the band fell apart and Stone Gossard & Jeff Ament went on to form Mother Love Bone.  The band scored a major label contract and were just about to storm the country in the late eighties, when the band's amazingly talented frontman Andrew Wood passed away due to a drug overdose.  Distrought, Stone and Jeff moved on to form a tribute album with Chris Cornell under the moniker Temple of the Dog (a line in one of Andrew's songs).  It was here that lead singer Eddie Vedder and lead guitarist Mike McCready hooked up with Stone and Jeff on a major recording.  These guys were Pearl Jam.  After spawning a hit in Hunger Strike from the album, the guys moved on and recorded Ten, which was released months before Nirvana's Nevermind.  Unfortunately it was only after Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit stormed the country that PJ gained any fame.  <br />I like Nirvana as much as the next guy, but Pearl Jam is the far superior band for many reasons.  Their songwriting, talent and lyrics make Kurt Cobain and his 3 chord punk rock songs look childish.  Ten is Pearl Jam at their most rock oriented.  Anyone can pick up this album and recognize songs like Even Flow, Alive, Black and Jeremy, (all of which are still in heavy rotation today, over ten years after Ten's release, how's that for staying power?)  The songs on this album are passionate and aggressive, largely due to Eddie Vedder's sublime vocals.  There is not one singerout there that possesses the pure power of that guy's voice.  Don't believe me?  Listen to this album.  You'll discover that every song is just as memorable as the last, with the same amount of passion and power.  From the first seconds of the primal \\"Once\\" to the last strains of the unbelievably beautiful soaring improv that is \\"Release\\", you'll realize that Pearl Jam is more than just a grunge band.  I guarantee you you'll be running to the nearest record store to pick up all of the band's other CDs (all of which are great, you should pick up Vs. after this one).  Pearl Jam was my favorite band before I even finished listening to this CD the first time, and the music will have the same effect on you.  New album due out November 12, it's gonna be great.  This record will CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  Thank for reading.  (You can check out my other PJ reviews by clicking \\"see more about me\\".)<br />Dan
B00006F7S4|2.0|As a big fan of Beck and beautiful bummer music, I was really let down by this release. I don't find one song of great beauty on here, or anything with which I connect on an emotional level. His singing here is flat and static. The lyrics are hard to hear. The arrangements are odd, sterile, and echoey, and the songs all crawl off to nowhere. Anyone looking to get into music of this nature would do better to buy Nick Drake, Pernice Brothers, Iron and Wine, Ron Sexsmith, Fairport Convention, Love, Bread, Elliott Smith, Josh Rouse, and Tim Buckley, to name just ten. All these artists take sad songs and subjects and elevate things with climbs and arrangement drama. Here, Beck borrows their bells and whistles, adds them at all the wrong times, and mumbles into a microphone inside Nigel Godrich's thousand-acre studio. Result's a snoozer.
B000059MLS|5.0|I luv this CD!!!!! The songs just take me in, and I especially like that if you watch the music videos, they have a story to them. 'Digital Love' is my favorite, but kinda sad at the end, when he wakes up.... Overall, if amazon had a ratingof 10, I would pick it!!!! This CD is kinda technoish, dance, and a little of stuff in between. You'll keep dancing, I'm sure.
B00006IU73|5.0|I'm probably not going to say anything that the other reviewers haven't said.  This disc is beautiful.  This band is beautiful.  They are incredibly underrated, and deserve a lot more acclaim than they're getting.  If you like their other discs, you will do backflips over this one.  And just in case anyone cares, I'm an avid Yes fan and just found out that Porcupine Tree will be opening for them on the second leg of their 2002 tour starting at the end of October.  They will be opening at most shows, but not all of them.  It's not yet posted on the PT site, but it is posted on nfte.org (the Yes website).
B000089A07|4.0|Red Dragon is based on the book by Thomas Harris,like the other two and it's the prequel to The Silence Of The Lambs and it's just as great as the first one.Of course,Anthony Hopkins is back as Hannibal(and like TSOTL,he's was only in for about 30 to 40 minutes)he's more chilling in this one then Hannibal,I don't know who was more creepy in the movie Hopkins or Ralph Fiennes,who was scary he gave me the willies.Edward Horton who is always a pleasure to watch was a great chioce for the role of Will Graham.Phillip Seymour Hoffman is annoying but good,Harvey Keitel is just ok as the role of Jack Crawford,which was greatly played by Scott Glen in Silence Of The Lambs.But the real treat was to see Anthony Heald as the head of the Baltimore Mental Clinic.Wonderful performances,great story and more scary then gory make Red Dragon a really enjoyable movie to watch in the dark and after you'll choose who's more creepy,The Tooth Fairy(Fiennes)or Hannibal(Hopkins).Have fun and bon-appetite.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Keeping their pummeling double rhythm guitar sound and weird synthy techno vibe alongside Till's haunting dark voice and throwing more melody into the mix, Rammstein is destined to go skyhigh with this release, attracting new fans with their different type of melody than past releases yet still maintaining their hardcore edge enough to keep their old fans listening. Rammstein is truly one of the few original bands being worked into mainstream rock/metal music today and is very deserving of the growing success they are getting. Although all of the lyrics are in German, you can feel the power and emotion in both the vocals and the music itself, making it a wise investment for any rock and metal fan regardless of language.<br />Till's voice soars even moreso than ever before and with a different touch this time, using his clean voice where it's appropriate and well placed, such as in &quot;Nebel&quot;, and going right to his trademark shout or German throat growl in &quot;Rein Raus&quot;, &quot;Feuer Frei!&quot;, and &quot;Zwitter.&quot; This is definitely the furthest he has taken his vocals on any of their albums.<br />As for the rest of the band, it's safe to say that their playing has evolved much since Sehnsucht, although that album is an great work of its own. The two rhythm guitars backed by the pounding bass make for a thick, crunching sound irregular today when weak, petty riffs will sell millions of albums (Creed, Nickelback, Puddle Of Mudd). The guitar section, including the bassist, show that simplicity can really go a long way and can contribute more to the song than a blinding speed metal solo, while still keeping an air of originality. The drums are powerful as well, keeping a steady rhythm all the time instead of jumping all over the set. Although the drumming is also primitively crushing, this is much appreciated in the same manner as the guitars, where simplicity yet relentlessness drives the instrument. The complexity comes in with the bands keyboardplayer, layering numerous synth lines, all lavish and catchy, yet odd, profound, and experimental at the same time. Some of the best examples of this can be found in his analog intro to &quot;Ich Will&quot; and the female vocal sampling near the end of &quot;Sonne&quot;.<br />Rammstein is truly an original band and it is nice to see hope in the future of heavy music, unlike the aforementioned groups who shouldn't even be considered music. Their influences are obviously along the lines of Nine Inch Nails, KMFDM, and Ministry, but Rammstein's sound is original enough to make you wonder how did they think of such a thing before you did. Check this out along with &quot;Live Aus Berlin&quot;, a powerful live album that captures the bands outstanding performance. This is one of the best releases in the last 2 years and they have definitely overcome the non-serious attitude with which some listeners took &quot;Du Hast&quot;.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I just got this album and its great im a big fan of the show and of the musical episode the real cast sing the songs the bonus tracks are great and relaxing my fave songs are 'UNDER YOUR SPELL' and 'Something to sing about' but not the demo thats good aswell but not as good as the shows one even if you not a buffy fan still get the album
B000002LKU|5.0|This album all but proves that Mark Knopfler was heavily influenced by JJ Cale.  The slightly witty lyrics, the smooth melodic harmonies with just a touch of an edge, the laid back guitar that somehow keeps you entranced.   One of those albums to take on a long road trip or to a desert island. Highly recommended.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Oh man, where do I begin.  This cd gave me hope for the musical world again.  In an environment where dime-a-dozen \\"punk\\" bands churn out catchy little songs every three and a half minutes, this cd is simply a Godsend.  Green Day has talent; Legitimate musical talent.  Talent is not writing 12 cute little guitar hooks and making an album full of what is essentially the same song on every track.  Talent is being able to mature as you grow as a band, being creative and writing good lyrics, and most of all, having the guts to do what you want to do to express how you feel.  If you listen to old Green Day, and listen to Warning, you will see what I mean about the band maturing.  I read people writing reviews calling them sellouts, blah blah blah.  These people are either ignorant, or have Billie Joe and Co. confused with someone else.  Listen to Misery, or Blood, Sex, and Booze.  How could anyone confuse that with pop?!?!  For God's sake, Misery has an accordian and a marimba in it!  Green Day is not a young group anymore.  They aren't old, but lets face it, they aren't 20 anymore.  They are more mature as people, and as a result, their music is going to change.  Think about it.  If they really, truly are punk rockers in heart and soul, then why wouldn't they put out what they want, and not worry about what anyone else thinks?  In fact, it would be selling out to just regurgitate the same tired songs again and again because you know people like them!  Speaking of the songs, they are outstanding.  From the mechanical, bass-driven \\"Warning\\" to the light-hearted, hopeful \\"Waiting,\\" no song is filler.  Misery is essentially a dirge about drug abuse (and excellent, by the way), while \\"Macy's Day Parade\\" provides a nice, mellow ending to the album.  \\"Church on Sunday\\" and \\"Castaway\\" are both great tracks, and \\"Minority\\" describes better than I could ever describe the way Green Day seems to function.  They will do what they want, when they want to, and don't particularly carewhat people think.  Ten, twenty, even thirty years from now, when people look back at the great bands that have been, Green Day will be remembered, not only as a great band, but as a band that helped define a genre, and a band that expanded what punk music could be.  Buy this cd, and see what I mean.

B000021YQV|5.0|I have many albums I've bought and listened and just really didn't 'feel'...Limp Bizkit did that to me with their new material, as do many bands...Anyways, when I bought this album, I immediately ate this thing up. <br />The layering of guitars, the schitzofrenic timimng, the oddball vocals, the thought provoking lyrics make this the most solid metal album I've heard in a while, if not 2001. While bands like bands like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit were busy doing rap metal, System Of A Down spent some times writing and creating a solid metal album. And I bought this album at about the same time I bought the new Slipknot album, and I will tell you, this blows Iowa out of the water. The lyrics are not about 'I hate the world' or 'I will take the life out of that [stuff] you call a heart' type stuff. Instead Serj and crew wrote about pressing political issues(Prison Song), psychotic cocaine snorting groupies(Psycho), police bruitality(Deer Dance), and so on. <br />But every one of the songs is beatufily written(with the possible exception of the somewhat short and weak Bounce, my least favorite track on the album), and has crazy timing changes, speed metal inflected drums, punk guitar power chords, and one of the best vocalists in modern rock today, all to make this solid, catchy, totally unMTV sounding record...
0553573403|5.0|WOW,<br />this book is amazing. Thats what I have to say in my first sentence. George R. R. Martin takes you into a well thought out world with well thought out characters with very interesting lives. The cahracters are just amazing, Tyrion, Arya, Eddard, Caitlin, Peytr, I just can't get enough, some people complain because there's too much sex, rape, gore etc. but I'm sure that we can all handle it. The blurring between good and evil is superb, by the second book I was totally confused about who was good and who was evil (mellisandre and the lord of the light and Danaerys Targaryen, if you've read the second and third books you'll understand). Also I like the fact that the starks dont win every battle and that eeven some of the main characters die. There are also plenty of battles in this fast moving book with strategies and logistics of armies. One thing that disappointed me was the lack of magic but there still was a small amount and all the battles made up for it and more ( i was always a bigger fan of the sword rather than sorcery) This is a great book and I would beg you read it. i have read Jordanl, Feist, and Goodkind and i have loved them also. I would suggest this but one things for sure....<br />Dont reccomend this to your mother.<br />hehe

And I bought this album at about the same time I bought the new Slipknot album, and I will tell you, this blows Iowa out of the water. The lyrics are not about 'I hate the world' or 'I will take the life out of that [stuff] you call a heart' type stuff. Instead Serj and crew wrote about pressing political issues(Prison Song), psychotic cocaine snorting groupies(Psycho), police bruitality(Deer Dance), and so on. <br />But every one of the songs is beatufily written(with the possible exception of the somewhat short and weak Bounce, my least favorite track on the album), and has crazy timing changes, speed metal inflected drums, punk guitar power chords, and one of the best vocalists in modern rock today, all to make this solid, catchy, totally unMTV sounding record...
0312932081|5.0|My 8th grade English teacher began reading this in class as soon as school started. I loved it from beginning to end After the 4th chapter I checked it out and it was amazing! <BR>  The plot blew me away and Ender helped me understand myself better! It shocks me at his age how he is doing so well. I love to read fantasy and sci-fi and this book is over the edge with the way it describes the world of children today cause I know the way Ender feels with Bonzo and Stilson. Over all the best book I ever had read.
B00006F7S4|4.0|For me, this album isn't about being bummed.  I don't pop it in and hear a downer album.  Certainly, it has emotional depth concerning the end of a long relationship and it deals with loss, with loneliness, but I see it as a much more honest approach to the issue than what I would label a &quot;downer album.&quot;  I see the downer album as the melodramatic hyperbole of some singer who is beating himself up over a lost love to the point of self-destruction.  I see that as this caricature of real emotion that we sometimes paint right when the relationship is ended.  This album goes beyond that.  It takes you through a longer period of time and of introspection upon that broken relationship and to me appears more honest as a result.  Once again, Beck provides us with another great album.  Is it some completely new style of music?  Certainly not.  Is it the greatest album I have ever heard?  Most likely not.  Is it worth the money and the time it takes to give it repeated runs in your CD player?  I think it definitely is, whether you're in the mood for an album on the concept of broken love or if you're just willing to listen for the wonderful textures of the music (I can't listen to Paper Tiger without just stopping in total awe of how beautiful the arrangement of the song is).
B00000DC10|5.0|This album is amazing. From Song 1 to 12, you're hooked! Dennis is an amazing singer and the band are amazing at the instruments. Buy this album because you won't be disappointed at all. Once they broke up Dennis went to \\"Intl. Noise Conspiracy\\" and the rest formed \\"Text.\\" Neither are as great as Refused was.
6305508550|4.0|When I first heard that Mike Judge had a movie coming out a few years back, I was not interested.  Nothing against Beavis and Butthead, but it just didn't seem like someone responsible for that could come up with a live-action movie that would really stand out to me, and the fact that it started from a tiny cartoon that was so exceedingly simple that it probably could have only been funny for the minute in which it took place.  By the time it was out on video, something convinced me to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did.  This movie is a joy to watch, and it never ceases to keep me laughing even after seeing it multiple times.  Judge has changed very mundane facets of the working life into hilarious scenarios: from driving to work amidst traffic to theme days at work, he caught it all.  Basically, it's freaking hilarious!
0312265859|2.0|I was disappointed to see that Evanovich is following Parker's footsteps. Relying on dialogue instead of description to move the story along. Repeating the same senarios over again is just plain lazy.  You would think that in number eight in a series her characters would have developed more and her action sequences would show more imagination.  By now Stephanie Plum as a character should be more interesting and experienced. Unfortunatly she's just irritating and immature. A good series would keep the reader wondering where the main character will go next.  In Evanovich's case her character goes nowhere and learns nothing.
0375703764|4.0|Quite simply, Mark Z. has a very impressive debut here, but whether it were a debut or not doesn't matter.  In a time when books seem so centered on their cinematic approach and their appeal to a movie-going audience, Danielewski uses the text to enhance his story.  It takes an adventurous soul to take this trip, but actually the story beneath isn't so far out that the average reader couldn't get into it.  This is no Ulysses, but it is quite successful in its experimentations.  The format enhances your experience, and the story leaves you wondering what the meaning behind it all is (or if all of this search for meaning is just a useless struggle).
B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam 6th album proves to be mind expanding.  Ever since the No Code album, the band has been challenging its audience.  The bands uncompromising ways can be heard on this album as never before.  A treat for hard core Perl Jam fans.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I resisted this CD for months.  A friend let me borrow their copy to burn back in March and I wasn't sold on it intially.  I finally gave it a chance this past August and now I love it, well most of it anyway (can't really get into that \\"Sylvia Plath\\" song).  I liked it so much I threw some money his way and got the real thing.  Now, I'm looking to get the copy with the extra disc.  My favorites are \\"Firecracker,\\" \\"Answering Bell,\\" \\"La Cienega Just Smiled,\\" \\"Rescue Blues,\\" \\"When The Stars Go Blue (of course),\\" \\"Wild Flowers,\\" and \\"Harder Now That It's Over.\\"  I'm even starting to like \\"New York, New York\\" which I wasn't sold on initially.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Without a adoubt this 1958 film from Britain's Hammer Studios is THE BEST Dracula film ever made! Not a remake, loose or otherwise, of the Universal/Bela Lugosi film (as the notes on the DVD box states), but a completely new interpretation of Bram Stoker's novel. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing are both brillant as Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing and the three women in the film (Melissa Stribling as Mina, Carol Marsh as Lucy and Valiere Gaunt as the vampire woman) are all great. For a film that was made for UNDER $200,000, the movie looks sumptuous. The framing on the anamorphic widescreen DVD appears a bit tight at the top and bottom with more information on each side, but the transfer is nice and bright, the picture is crystal clear and the colour is fine. The only extra is the original trailer (a little over 2 minutes long) and some poorly written notes on the Hammer/ Dracula series. A commentary with Chris Lee would have been nice or an interview, but anyone wanting to know Lee's views on the Dracula films could check out Anchor Bay's fine DVD releases of \\"DRACULA, PRINCE OF DARKNESS\\" or \\"SCARS OF DRACULA\\", if she or he hasn't already. But the film is the thing and I think too many DVD's lately have been loading TOO many extras on their disks and there is such a thing as overkill. All in all, a nice package. It's great to have this classic film on DVD. <br />  Just one note about the aspect ratio: I've seen this DVD on both a widescreen TV (16x9) and a normal 4x3 TV monitor and if you watch the letterbox version on a normal TV you see more of the picture. When viewed on a widescreen tv the picture is cut off at the top and bottom (as one reviewer mentioned, Chris Lee's head is cut off in one scene). When Dracula is talking to Harker at the beginning on a 4x3 tv you see all of Lee's head but it is partially cut off on the widescreen tv. Also in the scene when Harker is writing in his journal up in his room, at the bottom of the screen on a 4x3 tv, you can see in the background the fire in the fireplace, but on the widescreen tv I couldn't see it. Has anybody else noticed this?
B0000665CN|5.0|This is an awesome cd/avcd import from Asia. With this set Kylie gives us her Fever cd with the hit singles Can't Get You Out Of My Head and Love At First Sight. The bonus is an avcd which has the videos for Can't Get You Out Of My Head, In Your Eyes, Spinning Around (love this one), and On A Night Like This. It also contains 2 remixes (Can't Get You Out Of My Head and In Your Eyes), 1 song from Kylie's Light Years album (Spinning around), and 2 non-album tracks (Boy and Rendezvous At Sunset). Overall I would recommend this set. It is definitley worth having in your cd collection.
B000020617|4.0|They got you hooked with anthems like \\"My Hero\\" \\"Everlong\\" \\"Monkey Wrench\\" and \\"I'll Stick Around.\\" Now the burst out with a new record recorded right in singer/songwriter Dave Grohl's home. So what do you get? You get a pantload of great songs like \\"Learn To Fly\\" \\"Breakout\\" \\"Stacked Actors\\" and \\"Next Year.\\" This album may be a lot more poppy than the last two but it still has the Foo Fighting feel that they throw at you. It starts off with the very anti-pop song, \\"Stacked Actors\\" which sounds like an echo of Dave's earlier career with Nirvana. The leading single (Learn To Fly) carried the album. It even topped the charts before the album was released. The record has an amazing studio sound to it. With drummer Taylor Hawkin's thrashing you feel like you're standing next to him as he's beeting his set to a bloody pulp. Where it lacks in the usual Feirce Foo Feel it makes up in some great tunes at excellent riffs. 8.5/10 Highlights: \\"Stacked Actors\\" \\"Breakout\\" \\"Learn To Fly\\" \\"Next Year\\"
B000055XMF|5.0|It's about damn time this movie gets re-released.  I had the VHS version for a bit, which was also very impressive.  In the past, the audio was very analog, and it didn't help matters when trying to understand the heavy English accented dialogue.  And, in the past there was also the crusty 80s film, which is nice for vintage quality.  This film is very important to mods and fans of The Who, and much was riding on the success of the digital remaster.  In short, the DVD passes with flying colors.  You can hear the dialogue better, and it looks better than ever.  The sound and vision is crisp, probably as well as the day it was filmed.  And, the extras are great.  The interview with Sting really helped bring great importance to the nostalgia of Quadrophenia, and the music era it is based on.  I also really liked the background info on the cast and crew, and what other projects they have been involved with since.  I watch it often, and still play around with the extras, which means it is worth the money.  It is a well done remaster job, and a great DVD put together.  The only qualm is the subtitle feature, which is filled with a lot of related trivia to the genre and the music.  It would've been even better if they subtitled the dialogue word for word, so that some of the non-English viewers can understand the strong accented dialogue better.  It didn't bother me, but I imagine it would bother some viewers.  The story is easy to follow, but most viewers might miss a line or two.  Overall, this is a grade a DVD.
B00004ZD69|5.0|ok, this is easily THE BEST album I have heard since Dark Side Of The Moon, which is still my favorite album. Godspeed creates music that is relaxing, yet haunting, yet uplifting. It's very odd, they can create a song that is depressing and sad, but be uplifting at the very same time. My favorite track on this album, and my current favorite song period, is Sleep. I recommend you not hear this track until you buy the album, this song alone is worth every lasy penny that you pay for the cd. It is unbelievable and I can't even begin to explain just how.......well, how god damn good it is, for real. I highly recommend this to fans of Mogwai and Sigur Ros. So, if you like any kind of spacey, relaxing, classical/rock music, I urge you to get in your car right this very moment, drive to your nearest record store, and pay whatever amount they are asking for it, it is worth whatever they are charging. Enjoy it!
B00005OCMR|5.0|Disney always has that annoying habit of releasing movies for limited times, and then re-releasing it only a generation later.  I'm glad that they compensated us with tons of extras for the wait.  The movie is quite possibly one of the best remaster jobs I have ever seen.  None of the crusty 80s film, and if this movie was released today, no one would believe it was filmed in 1982.  It looks and sounds that good.<br />The extras are too many to list, but all of them are great.  The documentary is insightful, but boring at times.  But, the great thing is, near the end of the documentary, they do tease the production of a Tron sequel.  God willing, I won't have to wait 20 years to own that one if it does happen.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I use to love it, like my top 5 CD's, but when THE EMINEM SHOW came out, I realized how boring the album is compared to it.  Maybe it's because at first I brought it to school to seem like a 'cool kid', and hten really got to love it and listened to it 24/7.  The highlights of it are probably \\"Who Knew\\", \\"Kill You\\", \\"Criminal\\" and the all-to-well-known, \\"The Way I Am\\".  The ones I could do without are some of the skits, \\"Drug Ballad\\" and \\"I'm Back\\".  <br />So-and-so songs are \\"KIM\\" (although it's a little to violent) and \\"Marshall Mathers\\".<br />All-in-all, this album is pretty good, but if the Eminem SHow had came out before I had gotten a chance to get this one, I would've skipped it, indefinately.
B00005JL78|5.0|i've watched it 5 times in the last 2 weeks! its like the movie of the century! two thumbs way way up!!
6304539258|1.0|I can't stand this movie! I absolutly hate this movie! It is so poor, boring, and stupid that I can't make myself get into it. Star Wars has some very cool sound effects but the acting is terrible and so is the boring script. I'd rather watch Sesame Street than this. This movie is for boring grown ups who like boring movies. Avoid it!
B00003CX8V|5.0|Some things have not changed much in the world of office politics and all things sexual since this movie was released some 40 plus years ago. Oh sure, today's tactical pursuit of illicit workplace liasons have adapted to the advent of pagers, cell phones, the Internet, not to mention a ginger dance around the legal land mines of sexual harrasment lawsuits, but viewing the cosmopolitan office scene of times gone by as defined by \\"The Apartment\\" is a worthy study in love and lust amid the corporate arena. C.C.Baxter, (Jack Lemmon) climbs the corporate ladder by making his apartment available to key personnel within his company for quickie liasons. Somewhat naive about the ways of the world, he develops a romantic attraction for the nubile elevator operator, Miss Kubelik, (Shirley MacLaine). She is however, preoccupied with the ongoing affair she is secretly involved in with the married big boss J.D.Sheldrake, (Fred MacMurray) who demands the key to Baxter's apartment from time to time in return for corporate favors. Why this wonderfully written and superbly acted film is sometimes defined as comedy escapes me. Sure this movie has many great moments of biting satire but at its heart is pathos on parade. Christmas and New Year's Eve never seemed so empty and pointless. Climbing the corporate ladder can carry a hefty personal price but I suppose that lesson is to be experienced by each generation of young lions who would covet the corner office. \\"The Apartment\\" is a great study in personal compromise most worthy of two hours of your time.
0792846338|5.0|I have always loved this horror-thriller classic starring James Caan as the popular romance novelist, Paul Sheldon, and Kathy Bates as his nurse and self-proclaimed \\"number one fan\\", Annie Wilkes. After saving him from a near-fatal car wreck, he awakes in her home and soon realizes that she is a psychopathic nurse. Paul also realizes that she is keeping him a prisoner in her isolated house. Annie wants Paul to write a new Misery Chastain novel just for her or she'll get nasty! The scene with a sledge hammer is not for the faint-hearted. The performances & plot are very convincing, and Kathy Bates even won the best actress oscar for her amazing realistic performance. Not nearly as gruesome and nasty as the Stephen King novel but still very<BR>enjoyable nontheless. Rated R for violence & profanity.
B000066NW0|5.0|Seriously, I was a big britney fan b4 avril lavigne. not that i'm not now, i still am, but i think if anyone can actually be the next britney, it would be avril. her music's great, the songs are catcy and it kinda gets stuck in your head. let's get real here. britney spears is like reigning princess of pop, just look at how many albums she sold. i bet avril lavigne can get much closer to being pop princess than anyone else... she got a deal b4 turning 16, so what can that say abt her? so i say: THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE, EVEN FOR BRITNEY FANS, BUT DON'T GO OFF THE BRIT-STER!!!   :) haha
B00003CWNR|5.0|Based on the novel by John Irving, set in the 1940s, the Cider House Rules is a heartwarming story of relationships bonded by love and care.<BR>The movie starts in a narrative style of Dr.Larch (Michael Caine) who is the caretaker of an orphanage in rural Maine. The orphanage has several kids managed lovingly by Dr. Larch along with two nurses. It is also a hospital, which takes care of delivering babies and terminating unwanted pregnancies in a discreet manner. Sometimes, prospective parents wishing to adopt a child visit the orphanage and a lucky one is taken away while the other children sadly wait their turn. One such orphan is Holmer ( Tobey Maguire) who is no longer a kid and has a special place in Dr.Larch's heart. While, the doctor shows no outward love for him, he has trained Holmer in the practice of gynecology and taken care of him in many ways known and unknown to the latter. Holmer is popular with all the kids and the one Dr. Larch has groomed to take over after him.<br />Then , one day a young couple arrives to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy, Wally ( Paul Rudd ) who is a pilot and his girlfriend Candy ( Charlize Theron ) have chosen this place because of it's remote location. Dr.Larch and Holmer take good care of her. Holmer is friendly with the couple and asks for a ride to town. He wants to see the world outside , he wants to do other jobs and things. His life so far has been confined to the orphanage.  He decides to leave the orphanage alongwith Wally and Candy to see the world. Dr.Larch can't accept this and is hurt, he howver, does not prevent Holmer as he knows that it was bound to happen. Everybody go out to  wish Holmer an emotional goodbye , but Dr.Larch who is unable to face the parting prefers to watch from his room. Holmer too cannot muster the courage to bid farewell to Dr.Larch.<BR>Now, he is on his own , he sees the ocean and the country side. Wally willingly offers him a job at his apple orchard. You must be the most overqualified apple picker he says. But, Holmer  takes it and quickly learns his job. He makes friends with the other black workers in the Cider House.He learns a thing a two about rules and about the tragic lives of his black co-workers.<BR>Inevitably, he falls in love with Candy who also fancies him especially when Wally is on war duty in Asia. The two have developed a relationship where the future is uncertain so, they prefer to wait and see. Meanwhile, Dr.Larch's health is failing and is to be replaced. What does Holmer do now? He is caught between the non-commital Candy and his moral duty of taking over the orphage and hospital after Dr.Larch. <br />The movie has a relaxed pace.The rural settings have a calming effect on all the characters.  Their emotions have been brought out in a quiet, dignified manner without any melodrama. You will pause to think about the life of orphans and the immense love and care their caretakers offer them. The acting is superlative. Michael Caine has won an Oscar for his role. Tobey Maguire as the young Holmer has delivered well. The movie  makes it's characters your own as they have their mind and heart in the right place. Definitely worth watching.
1558908846|2.0|I grew up reading the 2000AD comics which introduced Judge Dredd , and I remember really looking forward to seeing what could be done with the character. <BR>The timing of the movie appeared so right Stallone and Schwarzenegger seemed at the peak of their appeal to the movie going audience. Consequently a monosyllabic... law enforcer against a Sci-Fi backdrop couldn't miss, could it ?<BR>Unfortunately here it did, in the original comics ( to the best of my recall ) Dredd never removed his helmet, that part could have played by anyone. Instead of paying a ludicrous 'star' salary that money could have been spent on the movie, where it was really needed - am I the only one who cringed at some of the dialog, laughed at the special effects and blinked as some of the sets shook ?<BR>This could have been the seed of a great movie franchise, instead a comic strip that enthralled kids throught the 70's was pulped into nothing in an hour and half. What a shame.
B0000009RX|5.0|Is it Frank Zappa's masterpiece? A demented version of SGT. PEPPER? The greatest piece of rock 'n roll satire ever? Probably all of the above. The best elements of Zappa's music - his gift for melody and arrangement, his criticizing (but funny) lyrics, his unusual production tricks - are at their finest here. It's a \\"collage\\" record of songs and sounds and dialogue, and not a second is wasted. No two tracks sound alike, layered with altered voices and strange instrumental textures, but it all fits together in a coherent way. Zappa took aim at both the trendy hippie culture and the clueless older generation. This 60s subject matter might seem a bit dated, but the music sounds as fresh and innovative as ever. 'Who Needs the Peace Corps?', 'What's the Ugliest Part of Your Body?', 'Absolutely Free', 'Let's Make the Water Turn Black' and 'Idiot Bastard Son', to name a few, are some of his best-known songs. Zappa made some other excellent albums in this time frame, but none of them quite has the same sustained brilliance of this one. Zappaphiles can argue whether WOIIFTM is the \\"best\\" Zappa album, but there is little doubt that it's one of the essentials.
B000002C1V|1.0|I miss the Floyd as they used to be;an introspective, experimental, phycadelic group who were not afraid to venture slightly beyond the realms of normal human understanding and experience. I just can't feel that much sympathy for Waters here, and the lyrics, while beautiful and poetic at times, do not convey subtle or layered messages, as his lyrics used to. Personally, I'd much rather listen to \\"Take up Thy Stethascope and Walk\\", which is an insanely dark song compared to this material. It seems like pretty much the only tradgity Waters has to go on is the death of his father when he was three months old. While that is certainly tragic, hey, my friend lost her dad when she was 11, which I think would be alot harder. Finally, I have a guestion to ask. After hearing this album for the first time, did anyone here say to themeselves \\"God Syd, I wish you were here\\".?
B000002KKK|5.0|one of the best ZZ TOP cd,s this is a lot better than hearing sharp dressed man lots of good stuff here the guys were working as a band more and lot of stuff from there roots are here Esther be the one is a is cool listen to the playing on that song !
B00006F7S4|4.0|first of all, i just thought that was a catchy title.  this isn't going to be the best work he ever does, this is his brooding piece, his &quot;all things must pass.&quot;  there are no gimmicks, no demons in his soul, no wolves at bay, just a sad man in a plain world.  all of the songs can be described as bare, both sonically and spiritually.  this is where real music comes from, this is the &quot;breakup&quot; album, but there's no anger, no revenge, no motive... just a tired man with a guitar.  some of the album sounds relatively like the Allman Brothers' ballads like &quot;Melissa&quot; while other parts are orchestral poems, but all of it is worthy of the anguished works of other artists, the ones you just love to play when stuff goes wrong at the end of day.  it's a trip down Beck's lonely highway, and where it leaves you is up to you.
B000002JOH|5.0|Back in the spring of 1992, I bought Vulgar Display of Power on the same day I purchased Queensryche's Empire.  Did your jaw just drop to the floor or what?  Two albums that qualify as stone-cold metal classics purchased on the same day!?  If I could remember the exact date, I'd petition to turn it into a national holiday.  They are that good, trust me.  Now on to our story...<br />A spartanly furnished one-bedroom apartment in the trendy, though crime-ridden, Fan district of Richmond, Virginia.  A comfortable seat on the living room couch.  A bottle of IBC within arm's reach.   `F!cking Hostile' blasting on the stereo.  What more can you ask for when you're 21?<br />Unfortunately, my bliss was soon interrupted by a persistent knocking on the front door.  I thought that if I ignored it, perhaps the unwanted caller would take the hint and go away.  Sadly, the knocking only grew louder and more insistent.  After about 30 seconds, I realized that I was going to have to open the door.  I tried to be optimistic - perhaps my visitor was a weary traveler whose only desire was to boost their energies by taking in a little Pantera and IBC.  Surely, I could help them with that.  <br />But, when I opened the door, I saw none other than Mrs. Hollister glaring at me.  The same raven-haired wench whose husband was my landlord.  Let's just say, I was about as likely to share my IBC with Prune Hollister back then as I would be today to share one with Mullah Omar.  That woman and her husband had done virtually nothing just a few months earlier when the roof of my bathroom collapsed on me while I was in there.  No apologies, no \\"we hope you don't sue us\\".  They simply acted like it was a routine occurrence and expressed surprise that I found it inconvenient that my bathroom had been reduced to a heap of rubble.<br />So, you'll understand why I wasn't exactly thrilled to have Prune Hollister up in my grill that fine spring day.  \\"Your music is too loud,\\" she shouted, \\"Turn it down!\\"<br />I just glared back at her, with Phil screaming in the background, \\"You're making us f!ckin' hostiiile!\\"  In fact, that's exactly what Prune was making me.  But, I had to control my rage.  I stood there in the doorway silently and when the song came to an end, I nodded blankly at Prune and shut the door.  Did I turn down the music?  Yes, but only out of respect for my other neighbors - certainly not for Prune, if that's what you're thinking.<br />So, here I am today, 10 years later, recalling the incident from a spartanly furnished one-bedroom apartment in the trendy and generally low-crime neighborhood of Point Breeze in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  My landlord is a tough old guy named Grimes, but he leaves me well enough alone and you can be damn certain that if my bathroom collapsed on me, Grimes would come over and fix it immediately.  You can also be pretty sure that, like Prune Hollister, he doesn't care much for Vulgar Display of Power.  On the other hand, he might just turn up in the mosh pit the next time Phil and the boys come to town and break out the metal classics from Vulgar like \\"Mouth for War\\", \\"Walk\\", \\"No Good (Attack the Radical)\\", \\"Regular People (Conceit)\\", \\"Hollow\\", and, of course, \\"F!cking Hostile\\".  You never know.  After all, Vulgar does represent a near perfect fusion of power and thrash metals.  And if you listen closely, you can almost hear the beginnings of nu-metal in there as well.  But let's not blame Pantera for the creation of that generally execrable genre.  Let's simply sit back with our IBCs and enjoy one of the greatest and most influential metal albums ever made.
B000002LQR|5.0|This CD represents the roots of the band, their true soul. Before getting contaminated, even though not that much after all, by the big money machine.<BR>They were pure at that time. Sometimes thoughtful (Under the bridge). Sometimes energetic (Power of Equality). Sometimes straight funky (If you have to ask and Funky monks). Sometimes silly (Suck my kiss). Sometimes merely crazy (Apache Rose Peacock). Sometimes provocative (Sir Psycho Sexy).<BR>During the whole listening you never, ever, have the feeling that they might have thought at any time of how the audience would have accepted the record. They didn't care. If you like it that's great otherwise, well, look for someone else.<BR>I don't think that, at that time, the Red Hot would have ever thought of recording, one day, songs like \\"Zephyr's song\\" or \\"Midnight\\". As I said they were pure at that time.
0451457994|5.0|Okay, there must obviously be a good reason why I have such a high opinion of Arthur C. Clarke in general and this book in particular. The reason is that real sic-fi for me should be scientific! I think highly of books like &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, but I just don't wish to call them sci-fi. They are good fantasy, very imaginative and well written. However sci-fi should have more, it should excite my imagination by showing me a picture of the future world, a place where we or our descendants could actually go in the future. In that respect Arthur C. Clarke is without peer, and hence the best sci-fi author ever. He actually wrote about satellites long before they were made, like Jules Verne wrote about submarines. Real sci-fi is about real technological possibilities and the effect those advancements will have on us and our social structures.<BR>  The one shortcoming of Clarke, his unscientific indulgence is his belief that the mind can exist without material basis, a sort of &quot;mental energy&quot;. Also his ideas on evolution could be improved upon. In a later book he converts Jupiter into a sun to hasten the evolution of the species on its satellites, but any such dramatic ecological change would not hasten evolution, but wipe out all existing species. But there is so much more realistic thought provoking visons of the future that I easily forgive him that. To come back to 2001, yes it is his most popular book and probably his best. The idea that another civilization left behind a tripwire to tell them of when mankind has reached a certain level of intelligence, fantastic! Read also &quot;The City and the Stars&quot; for another fantastic yet realistic vison of the future.
6302797535|5.0|This was THE MOST awesome murder mystery parody since I saw \\"Clue.\\" It's hysterically funny, and sorta pokes fun at fictional detectives. I quote the lines all the time- \\"My hats off to the man with the siv in his back... 'cept for the fact that he's dead, he was no dope...\\"
B00005RDRO|4.0|\\"...Neither did I.\\"<br />I'll start with the obvious--'Murder by Death' is hilarious. Which can be credited, no doubt, to Neil Simon. My first exposure to Simon was the tremendously funny `Prisoner of Second Avenue', in which a husband and wife swap quips over which one of them was responsible for letting their place be burglarized. After reading that Simon had written the script, I knew that I had to see this. Add to that the fact that I've loved mysteries all my life, was raised on them, in fact, since infancy, and it's no wonder that I had high hopes. <br />Simon didn't let me down and neither did the ensemble cast. I could tell you about the tremendous one liners, as I had read about them before viewing the film myself, but really you must hear the way the actors throw them out. If the ones recited by the reviewers here make you chuckle, I can almost guarantee that you will be holding your stomach and wiping your eyes when you actually watch the movie. It's delightful, truly! I just know I'll be going around for days with some of the lines on my tongue, waiting for an excuse to use them.<br />If you liked `Clue', as many others have mentioned, you must watch, no, own, `Murder by Death.' It's one of those movies that invites you to set a date and watch it every year with a small group of friends.
B000002JSP|4.0|The complaint often voiced concerning &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; is that it is heavy on the keyboards in a progressive 1980s style that differs drastically from their usual tribute to Muddy Waters or the year 1450. I don't mind this album brings a different musical flavor to the table. John Paul Jones' keyboarding is featured more prominently than ever before on this record. By the time &quot;Out Door&quot; was released during latter 1979, Led Zeppelin were considered rock and roll monoliths at worst. They earned the right to express themselves in different musical styles. For the most part, &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; works. &quot;In the Evening&quot; is unmistakeable Zeppelin. &quot;South Bound Suarez&quot; shakes, rattles, and rolls to a banging piano and overall musical format that's unique unto itself. &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot; was a laid-back top 21 smash with distinguished drumming solo sections by John Bonham. &quot;Hot Dog&quot; is pure bluegrass fun that probably took long-time Zeppelin fans by surprise during its release with its hillbilly nature. &quot;All My Love&quot; was the most loved love song the British quartet released. &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl&quot; has a tired, after-hours feel with a weeping guitar solo by Page. The the only thorn on this rose is &quot;Carouselambra,&quot; which sounds like it was recorded for the soundtrack to &quot;Revenge of the Nerds.&quot; Too heavy on the keyboards, too long in duration, and too montonous to be entertaining, it sticks out like a sore thumb when sandwiched between all-time classics like &quot;All My Love&quot; and &quot;Fool in the Rain.&quot; This album would rank among any of its previous releases had it included still unreleased numbers like &quot;Wearing and Tearing&quot; to replace &quot;Carouselambra&quot;. Overall, however, &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; leaves the listener with 30+ minutes of quality music that differs drastically in style from previous efforts such as &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; or &quot;Runes.&quot;
B00004Z459|5.0|A lot of people are saying that LP are crap because they aren't \\"true metal\\" and anybody who likes metal shouldn't be listening to them because they are posers. They also say that the only reason LP fans like LP is because we don't know any better.<BR>Well, guess what? I'm a big fan of your \\"true metal\\" as well as LP. I like bands such as Opeth, Gordian Knot, In Flames, Metallica, Iron Maiden, Black Sabbath, Extol, Rush, Sepultura, and every other Heavy/Death/Progressive metal band you can think of. Just because a band doesn't sound like what you want it to sound like doesn't make it crap. You're saying it's not good because it's not metal??? You really need to expand your horizons and open your mind. To me, music is music. It doesn't matter if there's rap in it or if the singer sounds like N'SYNC (I don't know why some of you think that, is it because of Chester's clean vocals in Papercut/In the End/Runaway/Pushing Me Away. That vocal sound is called SINGING, not \\"sounds like N'SYNC\\"). They produce good, original music. They aren't posers, I've never heard anybody that sounds like them.<br />Anyway on to the review of the CD.<BR>1)Papercut-(9/10) Great opening. Lots of rap but I don't mind the kind of rap with poetic lyrics. I like Chesters singing part at the end.<BR>2)One Step Closer-(8/10) Short, but still a great song. Great for building up adrenaline. You've all probably heard it on the radio.<BR>3)With You-(8/10) Solid song. I love the bridge (I think it's called the bridge anyway)<BR>4)Points of Authority-(8/10) My favourite verse by Mike is in this song. Chester's voice must have been torn to shreds by the end of this song.<BR>5)Crawling-(7/10) I loved this song at first but started to get tired of it. Still a great song though. I like the video.<BR>6)Runaway-(8/10) Good song.<BR>7)By Myself-(7/10) Sounds like a lot of noise but if you listen to it carefully it is very melodic.<BR>8)In the End-(8/10) Every time I listen to this song I hear some new instrument in the backround. Listen to this song from the CD, the radio version is very bad sound quality.<BR>9)A Place for My Head-(9/10) It took me a while to get into this song but now it's one of my favourites.<BR>10)Forgotten-(10/10) My favourite. Everything about it's great.<BR>11)Cure for the Itch-(8/10) This song takes a few listens, but you learn to love it by listening to it carefully.<BR>12)Pushing Me Away-(10/10) Another favourite. It seems different from the other songs somehow.<BR>Overall this is one amazing CD. The only problem is it is way too short. They should have threw in the old Hybrid Theory songs such as Carousel and And One, as well as My December. You should download them because they are worth a listen too.<BR>My December-(10/10) Is this the same group who made One Step Closer? Olie[stink]! One of the most beautiful and haunting songs I ever heard. Did Limp Bizkit make anything like this, I don't think so.<BR>High Voltage-(6/10) An ok song. Don't know what it's about.<BR>High Voltage Remix-(7/10) This isn't the remix on the Reanimation Cd. This is the version where Chester has a part near the end.<BR>Step Up-(6/10) A song with just Mike. Gets kind of boring.<BR>And One-(8/10) I haven't heard this song in a while but I remember it was a great song. It's just Chester as I remember.<BR>Carousel-(8/10) Great song.<BR>Part of Me-(9/10) An amazing song.<BR>Technique-(7/10) Kind of like Cure for the Itch.
6303367518|5.0|Saw the movie in the theater, which is the best way to appreciate the river scenes. Had the opportunity to see \\"white water\\" up close. Wow! Loved the storyline;loved Meryl's role as the strong yet gentle woman who can think for herself. Loved the music, which I believe has Celtic roots. Would like to purchase the soundtrack.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man is the best superhero movie of the past 20 years.<br />It's closest relative in the success of translating both the immense scale and intimate characterizations of the character is 1978's Superman. When Superman was released, Christopher Reeve was an unknown who took that blank slate and brought Superman to life, his Clark Kent was a bumbling and stumbling fool while Superman was heroic and majestic. I thought Tobey Maguire was a good choice to play Spider-Man but worried that his fame may dominate the role - so it would be \\"Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man\\". Well, file that away in the cabinet of bad ideas, because Tobey Maguire is the living embodiment of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Instantly you sympathize with the character, the lowly everygeek who gets pushed around at school and dares not approach the girl he's loved since he was six, filled out beautifully by Kirsten Dunst.<br />X-Men was a good comic-to-screen execution but had the unfortunate need to explain several characters' origins in a short amount of time, Spider-Man takes the advantage of a solitary origin and allows us to see the character evolve with time - stunningly faithful to the source material but moving at a good on-screen clip. When Peter is bitten by the spider and receives his powers, you jump with him roof to roof, laugh as he tries out his new abilities and marvel as his motions loosen up and become like the human spider who's existed in our minds and in two dimensions for these many years. Instead of dark and brooding, we get a hero who takes tragedy and becomes heroic and a symbol to the people he helps. The credo of \\"With great power comes great responsibility\\" is translated by Maguire into the \\"Friendy neighborhood Spider-Man\\" who makes the skyscrapers of New York his home.<br />The Big Apple should get some on-screen credit as well, Spider-Man is able to simultaneously swing above the people but weave his web from building to building - never skipping a beat as it becomes second nature to wind his way through this world unto itself.<br />Willem Dafoe does a good job as industrialist Norman Osborn who makes the transition to the maniacal Green Goblin. The scenes where he struggles with his madness are both funny and sad, while the explanations for his appearance are actually made more logical within the context of the film than in the comics - usually the opposite. My only complaint is that he is a little too much of a wisecracker than menancing villain, but his actions in the films final third make up for it.<br />Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben come across as a loving couple, but not as hickish as Ma and Pa Kent - which is quite accurate. The scenes with Peter and his Aunt are nicely done as well, rooting the fantastic world of Spider-Man with the very real world of Peter Parker. J.K. Simmons is brilliant as newspaper magnate J. Jonah Jameson, perfecting the art of cigar chomping bluster - the scenes with him were way too short, please more JJ in the sequel! James Franco did well as the neglected Harry Osborn, making a unique dynamic in which his best friend and his father are both superpowered beings on flip sides of the coin who must sit down to dinner together.<br />Kirsten Dunst is superb as the sexy, yet damaged Mary Jane who is part of the fabric that makes Peter Parker/Spider-Man discover his true purpose and find himself with her behind him. Her performance is subtle, but the scenes with her and Tobey Maguire are well done.<br />Spider-Man does its source material proud, and is a film that can be enjoyed by both diehard fanboys and the general public. It is what Superman was, and the first Batman continued. Watching this makes you wonder what Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher were doing when they destroyed the Batman mythos in the cinematic disasters of the three Batman sequels. Ditto for Superman 3 and 4. Spider-Man and Superman are the benchmarks for excellence in comic filmmaking, proving that youcan take these Amazing and Sensational characters of two dimensions and faithfully create an entertaining and engaging film without dumbing it down.

B000002J1F|5.0|Anyone who doesn't have FRAGILE is seriously missing out on one of the greatest albums ever made in the history of music.<BR>(I'm not kidding).
B000002J1L|5.0|1971's &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; was Genesis' third album, and the first album featuring the &quot;classic&quot; line-up of the band: singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, and, making their debuts, guitarist Steve Hackett &amp; drummer Phil Collins. It's a wonderful, majestic Genesis album featuring several of the band's classic, storytelling art-rockers, such as &quot;The Musical Box,&quot; &quot;The Return Of The Giant Hogweed,&quot; &quot;Seven Stones,&quot; and &quot;The Fountain Of Salmacis.&quot; &quot;Harold The Barrel&quot; shows off the band's humorous side, telling a very amusing tale about a guy who's about to jump off a window ledge. &quot;Harlequin&quot; is a lovely acoustic number, and Phil Collins makes his fine lead vocal debut on the short but very-sweet, &quot;For Absent Friends.&quot; The Genesis men play the material with passion &amp; ferocity, and Peter Gabriel sings with great emotion (and he's also an excellent flute player, t'boot). For some fans, Genesis started with &quot;Nursery Cryme.&quot; While this is totally not true (don't disregard &quot;From Genesis To Revelation&quot; or &quot;Trespass,&quot; guys), &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; DOES mark the first time the band started to get seriously noticed as a musical force to be reckoned with, and with darn good reason. &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; is classic Genesis all the way. :-)
B0000028PI|4.0|The Last Temptation is Alice's 90's answer to Welcome to My Nightmare.  Temptation is not as tight conceptually as Nightmare, and the selections work well as a collection of individual songs.  Alice puts more blood and sweat into this one, probably more than any project he's been involved with since the '70s.  I love a good half of the album, and only a couple of tracks are less than pleasing.  My faves are \\"Nothing's Free,\\"  complete with old school Alice speak-singing, \\"Stolen Prayer,\\"  backing vocals by Chris Cornell, and \\"Cleansed by Fire,\\"  simply one heck of a catchy tune.  Of course, there's \\"Lost In America\\" which was endorsed at the time by Beavis and Butthead, and could have served as their theme song!  <BR>     If I have one complaint, it would be the band.  Not that they're bad, but Alice hasn't had a group with same players on back to back albums for a while now.  Stef Burns is back from \\"Hey Stoopid,\\"  but otherwise we get the usual revolving-door musicians.  (Maybe Alice should call Tony Iommi, haha!) Also, when you see six people given writing credits on a song, you really wonder just how much imput Alice actually had in all this.  Small gripes though, the music manages to overcome whatever the circumstances.  The Last Temptation stands as one of Alice's better albums, and doesn't feel as calculated as the '80s cheese metal \\"Trash\\" nor the 2000 trend metal of \\"Brutal Planet.\\"
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you are not a regular follower of 'Buffy' you won't fit this into the story arc at all (probably) but you'll love the songs just the same. Seeing myself in that situation my favourite would probably be the wonderful Amber Benson-sung &quot;Under Your Spell&quot; or at the other extreme end of the ranhe Nick Brendon's &amp; Emma Caulfield's 30s to 50s retro &quot;I'll never tell&quot;.<br />If you are a fan the ASH melting with AB's &quot;Wish I Could Stay&quot; will probably have you in tears and the kind-of-Grand-Finale &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot; in hightened expectations - no matter if they actually come true...<br />So this is music for the people, all in all! And this person sure is wishing many take it to their hearts. Is that so very wrong?
B00006DEF9|5.0|What happens when you take the greatest film musical of all time and pull out all the stops to make the greatest \\"special edition\\" DVD yet released? It's Warner Home Video's new 50th Anniversary edition of SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. If you have the old DVD, you can use it for a coaster on your coffee table. This new remastering is so far superior, it's staggering. Unbelievable sharpness and clarity, with hues and colors that bring out the essence of the original 3-Strip Technicolor photography. The sound is also greatly improved.<br />The film itself is such a brilliant, timeless satire, that it will likely never seem \\"dated\\". It was produced and created with such intelligence, wit, and taste, that it never fails to grab audiences of all ages. If you're one of the few that hasn't ever seen this film, BUY THIS DELUXE EDITION! You won't regret it. If you have already \\"seen the film\\", you will find this remastering job a revelation, and you will see and hear things you never heard before.<br />The extras are quite special, too. The documentary about the making of the film is beautifully done, and tells you everything you want to know about how it all came together. A longer, 1996 documentary made by Turner about producer Arthur Freed is really entertaining and informative as well. What's really fascinating is how dingy the clips of SINGIN' look in the old docu as opposed to this new transfer. Also included are tons of other goodies including all the recording session material, the one surviving outtake of Debbie Reynolds singing YOU ARE MY LUCKY STAR (it is explained in the documentary that this is the ONLY outtake number that has survived!) and a lively commentary by many of the stars and creative team.<br />All this for an incredibly low price makes this, hands down, the best DVD special edition ever produced. Hats off to Warner Brothers!

0743216458|4.0|Ambrose is a competent but not an exceptional writer. Nonetheless, I would still recommend Band of Brothers. There are many instances when Ambrose breezes over what should have been important discussions of battles, and he moves along at a rapid clip as if he's given the reader all he needs or wants to know. I also defy most readers to keep all but a handful of soldiers straight. A number drop into and out of the account of the 506th Airborne  Division so infrequently that it's often tough to remember who's who. Nonetheless, Ambrose does manage to pull together a lot of interesting stories about the men who served in the 506th at this point in history and also gives a good sense of many of the hardships and fears the combat soldier faced for those of us who will never share this type of experience. Though definitely a flawed work, at no point while reading it was I ever bored with it or looking to put the book aside to move on to something else.
014017821X|4.0|This book is very well written and I really enjoyed some of the stories. I found some of them a bit too gory for my taste. But the Bloody Chamber is great and The courtship of Mr. Lyon is beautiful.
6300147983|5.0|Although I am a very serious person. This movies is not and should not be like the broadway show- however it is a very good story about performance artist and their lives. It is about accepting themselves before they take the extra walk of becoming a star. I think you will enjoy it. And forget whatever else is saying. The music is great, the dancing is wonderful, and the plot is good. This is a movie- and done very well.
B00004SWBD|4.0|Wanna let out some anger? Well this is the perfect CD to do so with! Just fire it up and scream along! Slipknot do a good job with this debut album!

B0000069NM|3.0|I guess I won't earn too many votes here, but I have to side more with the detractors than the boosters. Yes, the combination of Motown/Muscle Shoals-inflected bass, snappy drums, cool retro-organ, and slinky, post-fusion guitar is a pleasing one. But after hearing the CD once or twice, the novelty of the sound wears off and you start wondering what the actual point is. The melodies and solos are neither exciting nor particularly memorable. The emotional content stays at the same level from one track to the next. The instrumentation never varies. Such a format is probably great for party background music, but it doesn't provide much interest for attentive listening.<br />By the way, if you want to hear cool, Sixties pop/jazz with a danceable beat, try to dig up an old Billy Larkin And The Delegates record, or even Lee Morgan's &quot;The Sidewinder.&quot; Those guys will show you how it's done.
0316096199|5.0|I was inspired to read Lucky after being dazzled by the author's bestseller, The Lovely Bones. I'm glad I did. Alice is a gifted writer. Her keen self-awareness and ability to project her inner voice into written words is breathtaking. Alice has blessed the world by sharing the details of her rape and subsequent journey. I'm tempted to share my favorite parts of the book, but it would probably be a spoiler.<br />I perceive Alice as a hardened survivor, as are many who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Our instincts are sharpened, but the price we pay is always being on guard and rarely feeling safe. I'm glad Alice has found comfort and happiness with Glen David Gold.<br />Lucky would be an ideal made-for-TV movie. Alice's story is courageous and inspiring.<br />Bill Lee, author (Chinese Playground)
6303407188|4.0|Ed Wood was clearly a somewhat weird man, and this celluloid look at his life is, well, pretty weird.  But it works because, while the movie clearly pokes fun at Wood's utter filmmaking ineptitude, it also manages to portray him in a somewhat sympathetic, almost reverent light.  As portrayed by Johhny Depp, Wood is an eternal optimist, who never gave up pursuing his visions, even in the face of his lack of talent and difficulty finding financial backing for his projects.  Perhaps the most telling line in the film is when Wood is on the phone with a potential backer for \\"Glen or Glenda,\\" and he says, \\"Worst Movie You've Ever Seen?  Well, I promise the next one will be better.\\"  This was obviously a man who wasn't going to allow a little thing like overwhelming disdain for his work to get him down, and it's hard not to admire such positivity.<br />For a small-time movie, \\"Ed Wood\\" was able to attract a pretty accomplished cast, and the performances reflect that.  In the tile role, Depp perfectly captures Wood's hopeless optimism and enthusiasm, wearing a perpetual happy smirk even when uttering lines like \\"I like to dress in women's clothing\\" (the scene where Ed appears in drag to reveal his fetish to his girlfriend is absolutely hilarious).  Sarah Jessica Parker is also excellent as Ed's girlfriend Dolores, who tries to stand by her man until she concludes that he and his cronies are \\"wasting your lives making s**t!,\\" as she informs them just before leaving Ed.  The most memorable performance of the movie, though, definitely comes from Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, a washed-up, morphine-addicted ex-star who bears more than a little bitterness toward Boris Karloff.  Landau does an amazing job of capturing the tragic essence of his character, who was both pathetic and good-hearted as he tried to rebuild his career and regain some semblance of dignity after years away from the limelight.  The scene where the 74-year-old Lugosi has to roll around in a pond at four in the morning, wrestling with a fake octopus that's missing its motor, is both touching and funny at the same time.<br />The movie, fittingly enough, ends with the making and premiere of Wood's defining movie, the stupendously and brilliantly horrible \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\\"  A movie about grave robbers from outer space, \\"Plan 9\\" is sort of a clinic of bad technique (even the film's backers, a couple of devout Baptists, are able to identify some of Wood's many errors).  Of course it's also the movie made famous for Ed's new girlfriend's chiropractor assuming the dead Lugosi's role by holding a cape over his face.  \\"Plan 9\\" is almost universally regarded as one of the worst movies ever, and a look at the bizarre life of its creator gives you an idea of just what was going on in his head.he morning, wrestling with a fake octopus that's missing its motor, is both touching and funny at the same time.    <br />The movie, fittingly enough, ends with the making and premiere of Wood's defining movie, the stupendously and brilliantly horrible \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space.\\"  A movie about grave robbers from outer space, \\"Plan 9\\" is sort of a clinic of bad technique (even the film's backers, a couple of devout Baptists, are able to identify some of Wood's many errors).

B000002JS6|5.0|This is an excellent old school metal album of the finest quality! This is a definite must for any rock fan. And if you are into rock you probably know this already. Anyway alot of people didnt think AC/DC could make a worthy comeback after Angus died, but not only did they make a comeback they made an excellent one! If you dont already own this masterpiece album put it on your to do list! Highly Reccomended!
B00006690G|5.0|Alot of you don't even see the talent,all you do is concentrate on how many curse words he says.But if you look past the vulgar language,you can definitely see the talent.I am going to use my rating system,with 0 being the worst and 5 being the best.<br />1.Curtains Up-(0/5)Basically,this is just a bunch of sounds and nothing interesting.<br />2.White America-(5/5)I found him screaming \\"WHITE AMERICA\\" over and over again to be very annoying,but the rest of the song is great.Not a bad way to start the CD.<br />3.Business-(5/5)This was another one of those catchy Eminem songs.This one is definitely worth checking out.<br />4.Cleanin' Out My Closet-(5/5)You have all heard this one before.It gets annoying after hearing it a bunch of times,but it's still great.<br />5.Square Dance-(5/5)Don't let the title fool you,this is a good song.<br />6.The Kiss-(?/5)This is another skit.I didn't really know how to rate this one.<br />7.Soldier-(3/5)This was one of my least favorites.Most of the time I skip it.It's just not good enough.<br />8.Say Goodbye Hollywood-(5/5)This is a good song to listen to.It never gets annoying.<br />9.Drips-(5/5)The 2nd best song on the CD.It has alot of sexual references.But it tells you to try not to get aids.<br />10.Without Me-(5/5)You all know this one to.It brings back the whole Slim Shady first single material.<br />11.Paul Rosenberg-(1/5)Basically,I didn't really find this skit that funny.All he talks about is telling Eminem not to carry his gun around and hollers the F word every chance he gets.<br />12.Sing For The Moment-(5/5)He samples Aerosmith's Dream On on this song.This is great,except for the chorus.<br />13.Superman-(5/5)Talks mainly about relationships.This was a pretty good song.<br />14.Halies Song-(5/5)For a singing song,this is pretty good.He does rap though at the third chorus.This song is great to listen to at any time.<br />15.Steve Berman-(?/5)Another skit that I don't know how to rate.If you listened to this skit on The MMLP,then you will know what will happen here.<br />16.When The Music Stops-(5/5)My favorite song on the CD.It talks about how easily people confuse music with real life.<br />17.Say What You Say-(5/5)The 3rd best song on the CD.Eminem and Dr.Dre diss J.D. mostly on this song.<br />18.Till I Collapse-(5/5)He won't stop rapping until he goes down in history,as the song tells you.Note:That was not an exact lyric from this song,but it gives you an idea of what this song is about.<br />19.My Dad's Gone Crazy-(5/5)His daughter has a guest spot on this song,and I think the title speaks for itself.<br />20.Curtains Close-(0/5)I personally didn't think this was a good outro.It is basically just that Ken Kaniff guy singing his version of Without Me.<br />Well,gotta run.Peace Out.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Oh my God, I just can't believe there are people out there that actually think Shrek is better than this.  Monsters Inc. is about a thousand times better with a great story, hilarious characters, and the most heart-breaking scene ever in a children's movie.  Shrek had a bunch of bad movie parodies and fart jokes.  I suppose people are entitled to their opinions...
B00000J2SP|4.0|I absolutely adored this album when I was a teenager and now, at the ripe age of 35, I still like it, though not as much. I think that I may have listened to it a few many times...or maybe I see the silliness behind some of the songs now.<br /> Anyhow, Rainbow's first album with singer JOE LYNN TURNER is still one of their best albums. Rainbow delved back into progressive hard rock on this, especially on cuts like \\"Maybe Next Time\\" and the title track.<br /> \\" I Surrender\\" gets the album off to a very powerful and upbeat<br />and slightly poppy start. It's their second cover of a RUSS BALLARD song( artists like RAINBOW, SANTANA and AMERICA all had hitswith RUSS BALLARD songs, tho RUSS himself never did.) I think JOELYNN TURNER sounds terrific on this song and on the entire album!<br />Nice sad, emotional guitar playing by BLACKMORE on this track.<br /> \\"Spotlight Kid\\" is probably my favorite song here! It's a fast paced, heavy metal song with some great lyrics and an amazing instrumental section; BLACKMORE's guitar solo is superb and I really love that little irish jig part( or russian jig, i dunno, george!) Very emotional vocal from TURNER!<br /> \\"No Release\\" is a slightly soulful/bluesy hard rock song> I like it!<br /> \\"Magic\\" is a progressive pop song, with a very melodic guitar line, which Turner sings along with.<br /> \\"Maybe Next Time\\" has BLACKMORE'S saddest ever guitar playing on it; the song is melodic, pretty and depresssing at the same time. BLACKMORE makes his guitar gently weep on this and it will make YOU weep if you don't watch out!<br /> \\"Cant Happen Here\\" starts out with a little rock-n-roll guitar lick from BLACKMORE, then the rest of the band joins in and the song turns into another emotional, but heavy prog rock song. This song has another outstanding vocal from TURNER, as does the next track, \\" Freedom Fighters\\", which is another highlight ofthis album. \\"Freedom\\" is another fast paced hard rocker, with some very intelligent lyrics. I'm not a big fan of the last two songs, \\"MIDTOWN TUNNEL VISION\\" and \\"DIFFICULT TO CURE\\". I know alot of people think very highly of this last track, but I always found it rather pretenscious( did I spell that word right?)<br /> Other than the last two songs, this is a great progressive hard rock album. I also think RITCHIE BLACKMORE hit his peak as a songwriter AND a guitarist on this. After this album, BLACKMORE seemed to keep borrowing riffs amd licks from earlier DEEP PURPLE and RAINBOW songs. He also began to overplay as a soloist after this, at least on the next two RAINBOW albums and the DEEP PURPLE album PERFECT STRANGERS. Many fine songs were still to come, though not THAT many; indeed, my favorite song off the nexttwo RAINBOW albums, SNOWMAN, wasn't even written by BLACKMORE.<br /> I hated RAINBOW'S next album, the very commercial STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE EYES, but DIFFICULT TO CURE is a great album!two songs, \\"MIDTOWN TUNNEL VISION\\" and \\"DIFFICULT TO CURE\\".

B00005R87Q|5.0|I have seen this movie now about 15 times, and never got bored. Again and again I could see this guys and girls speeding to the limit. Just don't let us see everthing so serious, it's a nice movie with some items in it they doesn't fit to reality, but hey, what the f...,it's just a game. Let them play. Maybe I like them so much because I am a speedfreak too, however this movie has fun and action and it's about friends hanging out together, getting a peace of their freedom.
0060977493|4.0|Poetic and simply written, &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; skillfully evokes a mood and atmosphere that is often hauntingly beautiful.  However, the plot is melodramatically predictable and a bit cliched.  One can say the same of the generally one-sided characters.  Still, among its florid metaphors (which are, at times, bogus)there lies some deep human truth for which the novel is worth reading.
B00005PJ6M|4.0|How it going, dudes?  Bill & Ted, leaders of Wyld Stallyns, from the great 1989 comedy, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, are back in this 1991 sequel!  Like their most excellent friend, Rufus, told you, they do get better.  But a totally evil dude from the future, De Nomolos, has sent two bad robots back in time to kill Bill & Ted, so he can rule the world, which will make it a terrible place.  Bogus!  They do, and in order to come back to life and save the world, Bill & Ted must beat the Grim Reaper in a game.  Can they do it?<BR>This film has both Keanu Reeves (Ted) and Alex Winter (Bill) returning, and George Carlin returning as Rufus to help them out again!  This movie is not as good as the first one, but it is still a MOST triumphant film!!  You gotta see it, too!!  So, again, \\"Be excellent to each other\\", and \\"Party on, Dudes!\\"
B000001FUZ|5.0|I could have sworn that I submitted a review on this classic.  Nonetheless here it goes again.  Probably Traffic's best recording and one to take with you on a desert island if you have only room for 20 discs.  Side 1 featuring Glad, Freedom Rider, and Empty Pages is almost a perfect side 1.  Heck Glad just may be my favorite instrumental of all time.  Love the drums on Empty Pages.  What a spunky syncopated beat.<br />Side 2 is no slouch either with the awesome title track and two more good tunes.  In general, the interplay between the organ, flute, and saxaphone is great throughout.  The rhythms are captivating and Stevie Windwood vocals are very good.  A keeper on all accounts.

0375805613|5.0|Get this book. It's the best bucks you'll ever spend. My 17 year old high school senior daughter's  class was asked to bring their favorite book from childhood to class. They had to read the books to the entire class. Of course she took this book. The entire class voted this book their favorite. Imagine an entire class of 16 & 17 year olds giggling and laughing over something they normally wouldn't be caught dead looking at. She told how her mommy would act out the voices and plead and beg them to not turn the page, and how they would beg to be allowed their turn to turn the page and see how upset Grover got with them. They would giggle and laugh and always act surprised with Grover when they found out who the monster was. As they got older they would try to comfort Grover cause he was so afraid, and reassure him the monster wouldn't hurt him. Later when my daughter imagined monsters under her bed, and for three nights in a row I couldn't get her to sleep by herself, I remembered the book and  got it out and read it for her. She was actually smiling when she went to bed and looked under her bed hoping to find a monster! There's only one problem ,you need to buy several books, because we went thru three while they were growing up, and I bought four more for future grandchildren. Now everytime someone has a baby I buy a book to include with the blankets and gowns. After all warm fuzzy memories are what it's all about.

0684847248|5.0|M. Scott Peck is a powerful writer.  I find his analysis sound, his tone warm and embracing, and his insight perceptive.  I only wish we could clone him-not only his body, but his mind and soul as well.  He has found a great way to articulate some aspects of Christianity that would embarrass most pastors and so called Christians.<br />His book focuses on love, which he defines as \\"The will to extend one's self for the purpose of nurturing one' own or another's spiritual growth.\\" (81)<br />He hits the mark several times in this almost perfect definition.  The first bull's-eye is the part about extending ourselves.  We need to be concerned with other people, which is so obvious that it needs no comment.  This idea is so old, that it must become new in our ears to have any affect (or effect) in our lives.<br />He prefaces it with the world \\"will,\\" which I take to mean a general disposition of the heart and the mind, as opposed to a mechanical habit of the hands and mouth.  Love is really state of mind, which produces actions, and is not an action in and of itself.  It is not a thought, but something that drives out thoughts, which drive our words and our deeds.<br />The nurturing aspect of love is another key element, since we are to build other people up.  Our lives are like whetstone: we are to sharpen other people.<br />What makes this definition unusual is that he includes one small qualifier: the aspect of nurturing ourselves.  This seems heresy to some love-fanatics, but I believe it is an important aspect of our spiritual health.  Selfishness is a sin, but the converse of selfishness-whatever you call it-is also a sin.<br />The people he is describing I believe, are the \\"angry activists\\" types that smear our TV screens.  You know the charitable organizations who get mad at you if you want to see their books and IRS records, or the people who get mad at you if you reject their friendly advice.  \\"I just want to help you!\\" he said with a sneer that revealed his fangs.  Those types of people.<br />Another type of person is the quiet sobbing martyr.  \\"I really don't care-do what ever makes you feel good.  I just go to the corner and mope and pout for the next six months.\\"<br />His book follows through his this great insight, not only into human behavior, but human attitudes.  Admittedly, love cannot merely be defined; it must be experienced.  However, Peck does a pretty good job.<br />Pecks ultimate aim is to make gods out of us:<br />\\"For no matter how much we may like to pussyfoot around it, all of us who postulate a loving God and really think about it eventually come to a single terrifying idea: God wants us to become Himself (or Herself or Itself).  We are growing toward godhood.  God is the goal of evolution.  It is God who is the source of the evolutionary force and God who is the destination.  That is what we mean when we say that He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.\\"  (269-270)<br />This makes simple sense: God is the absolute perfection in love, and as we perfect our love, we are becoming more and more like Him.  And the same thing applies in other areas of our life, such as faith, endurance, and even punctuality.<br />Actually, this is really a Judeo-Christian doctrine that got lost somewhere along the line.  We are created in God's image (Genesis 1:26-27), and we are made a little lower than God. (Psalm 8:5)  The King James Bible mistranslates the Hebrew word \\"Eloheim,\\" which is usually translated as \\"God,\\" as angels.  Later in the Psalms, it says that we are Gods, children of the most High (Ps. 82:6), a verse that Jesus quoted to the Pharisees (John 10:34-35).  St. Athanasiaus succinctly said, \\"He became man, so that we might be God.\\" (On the Incarnation, 54: 3)  And so forth.<br />This book is not so much about love as it is about \\"toughlove.\\"  You are encouraged, hugged, caressed.  But you are also grabbed by the scruff of your neck and given a boot to the butt to get you going.  Somehow thisbook works out, and Peck gets his message across.book works out, and Peck gets his message across.

B00006G8K0|4.0|Warner has done a terrific job with some movies while others (such as HOD) seem to have escaped their attention. Time After Time, for example, has audio commentary from director Nicholas Meyer and star Malcolm McDowell and the transfer (despite a few analog artifacts) is nearly flawless. Curse Of Frankenstein has a better picture overall--less problems with grain but appears darker than HOD. Horror of Dracula is certainly a 5 star film and Hammer's finest hour (along with Revenge of Frankenstein. ROF stands as a rarity like The Godfather 2 where the sequel is superior to the original film in the series).   The matted picture and transfer are pretty good overall. There are a couple of sequences where the transfer exhibits a high amount of grain and some analog artifacts. The good news is that as the film progresses the picture quality does improve (except for a few short sequences). The beginning of HOD looks like it was pulled from the same print as that used for HOD on video.  The colors are richer and more vibrant than the PAL-VHS release.  The extras are relagated to the trailer and info on the performers/film. The info section is pretty basic and most Hammer fans will know this stuff. Like The Mummy (which I personally think upon seeing again is a superior transfer to Horror), this is a nearly bare bones DVD. Still, it's nice to have Horror available on DVD and in the correct aspect ratio for the first time since it's release in 1958.   Enough has been said about this fine feature in terms of the plot and performances so I'll be succint; Chris Lee IS Dracula. He manages to capture Stoker's Dracula with all his sexual swagger and refined sense of culture. Lee captures the dual nature of Dracula; he's both monster and seducer (capturing elements of the original performance by Max Shrek in Nosferatu and Lugosi's Dracula). Peter Cushing captures the energy and single mindedness of Van Helsing portraying him as a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Sinbad. His rich performance invests quite a bit of power in a role that had little to offer in previous films. Michael Gough also gives a focused fine performance as do all the actors. I don't think it odd that the actors all have English accents--no more odd than hearing American (or English) actors with fake middle European accents.  Terry Fisher's direction is taunt, visually appealing and more performance orientated than some directors. The production design makes this the richest Dracula film Hammer produced. Brides of Dracula is the only film in the series (and technically speaking it wasn't a Dracula film but a Van Helsing film) that rivals HOD for production design and performances (although BOD suffers from a schzoid script that clearly had too many cooks)  During the mid-60's the production values took a significant drop and by the end of the 60's and early 70's, Dracula films began to look like the poverty row films Hollywood produced during the 30's, 40's and 50's. While other Hammer films (most notably Dracula Prince of Darkness)have Dracula in a mere supporting role, HOD puts the character and conflict right up front. The final sequence between Cushing and Lee is still one of the best shot action sequences in a Hammer production. Fisher and his director of photography were in top form throughout this fine film.  Jimmy Sanger's adaption manages to incorporate a number of key points from the original novel while injecting surprise with some intriguing changes. (If you haven't seen the film I'd suggest skipping the rest of this paragraph) The scene where Van Helsing has to dispatch Harker--who has become a vampire--is powerful and original. It works despite its lack of fidelity to the novel.   So, how can we improve this film for future DVDs? Do what I did last year--write Rhino (which is owned by Warner) and let them know you'd like a special edition of this film produced. They'll do it if their parent company will allow them to license it.  This DVD isn't exactly a disappointment just an underachiever. The packaging isn't as good as the box for the VHS (and has a picture that's clearly from Dracula AD 1972--just look at the hair style!) I was just hoping for something better for this fine film. It may not be Citizen Kane in the eyes of critics, but it is as important to the horror genre.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Theatrical trailer: \\"The Only way to unwind the future is to follow the path.\\" -- The path of a 'border-line, adolescent, sleep-walking schizophrenic' named Donnie Darko living in a parallel universe -- or is it a total delusion? -- guided by the six-foot rabbit Frank. -- Frank who turns out to be much more than just the strangeness he appears to be: Something (his energy, essence, vibrations, importance) the other characters in the movie tune into without totally understanding the entire gestalt; plus: It is difficult to see, but it seems that all of these characters are a part of the whole: Many mentors guiding Donnie along the path, and psychotic-appearing acts that he commits with reasons that seem to be connected with setting things right, to rescue: Donnie Darko -- the chosen one, the savior of the world.<br />When I first watched this movie, I found myself caught in between liking and hating it. I loved the character Donnie Darko: Although he was suppose to be mentally disturbed, I found him to be very perceptive, witty, intelligent, and one of the most sane people in the entire movie, challenging those who failed to see things the way they really are -- which causes him to be trapped in extremely-painful isolation. I loved many of the other characters as well: His girlfriend, his two sisters, his father and mother and many others, the teacher Drew Barrymore plays, Patrick Swayze's character, and the old woman who keeps walking back and forth to the mailbox to check for mail that is never there, almost getting hit by cars passing by -- although I found myself very disappointed, at first, that as strong a part as she seemed to play, she wasn't explained or used as fully as I hoped for; I found myself thinking of the movie 'Somewhere in Time', where Christopher Reeve -- playing a playwright in the 1980's -- is approached by an old woman --played by Jane Seymour -- who pleads for him to come back in time to her in the world of 1912 where she lives; but nothing like that appears to happen.<br />I only found myself wading through a very slow movie that tempted me-several times-to jump to the end to find out where all of this was leading, but I avoided the temptation, watching with irritation with the slow pace, and fascination for the eerie use of sound and special effects drawing me deeper in...until...I got to the end, and everything was suppose to wrap up neatly ...but it didn't: \\"Oh, yuck!\\" I found myself vocalizing to an almost empty room, except for me.<br />But after watching the commentary with the writer/director Richard Kelly and Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Donnie, and the deleted and extended scenes, it made more sense to me, and the old woman fit more into what I hoped for -- although very subtly -- and the ending was more satisfying, and some of my impressions were confirmed. <br />And now I can say I like the movie. -- But even more so: The DVD as a whole; DVD is the way to go with this one; not VHS, for you need the deleted and extended scenes -- which the director cut because he needed to make a two and one half hour movie into a two hour one -- and the commentary to best understand and appreciate the movie, an understanding and appreciation you will not get by the VHS alone: You can either buy the movie so you can have time to go through at least once, watch all of the twenty scenes (with commentary and without), watch -- especially -- all the way through with the director's commentary, the commentary with the cast (if you so choose, but not necessary, for there is very little information that isn't all ready covered by the director in a much more straightforward manner), and check out the other features as well; or, if you would rather avoid the expense, you can rent it (all by itself) at a place that allows you to have it for five days, and: ENJOY!
B00005JL3A|5.0|... Now let me tell you I was mad excited when I heard about this movie coming out in theatres, so I went to see it the first day it came out. I am so glad that guy who directed Event Horizon and the first Mortal Kombat movie directed this one also, because those two movies were good and thus so is Resident Evil. Originally they had another director instead but his script was dumb so they scrapped him, and thank heavens for that! I could only find one minor, very minor flaw in this movie. He should have included more enemies besides the dogs, crows, zombies, and the one licker (that morphs into a bigger version). I really wanted more lickers and unfortunately there were no hunters in this movie, but maybe he'll fix all that in the sequel Resident Evil: Nemesis ... Overall, this is the best video game movie out there for now and I recommend buying it, or at least renting it.
6304493681|5.0|this is one of my all-time favorite movies! not for the feeble minded, this movie brings into thought ideas of reincarnation, and the questions &quot;what is my soul and how does it make me myself?&quot; full of action and intelligence, i highly recommend this one!
B00005LK95|4.0|I've been a long-time fan of Short Circuit and it's sequel, Short Circuit 2. When it comes to DVD's, I'm there! They're great in so many ways. The Short Circuit DVD is great in some ways, but definately could've been better.<BR>First off, the film transfer is pretty good. For the first time ever, I was able to watch the film in widescreen, while before I was only able to view the &quot;fitted to TV&quot; 3:4 aspect ratio (for any fans of the 3:4 picture, this DVD IS double-sided and HAS the 3:4 picture size version as well). The colours are vibrant (but not too vibrant), the picture is sharp, and there are only a few blemishes and dirt marks on the film. The sound was great! Sure, it hadn't been remastered in Dolby 5.1, but it still was Dolby Surround. The music was MUCH clearer than what was heard on the VHS version. Many areas of the film's musical score which were barely audible before were very clear on the DVD.  <BR>Here's the bit of down-side to this DVD: there are hardly any extras. The making-of featurette is at most five minutes long, and though we do get to see that Fisher Stevens is very unlike his character Ben Jarhvi, it ends very abruptly. The movie trailer section doesn't even include the Short Circuit 2 trailer. It would have been nice if more extras had been inserted, like the Short Circuit Special Edition DVD.<BR>If you're a fan of Short Circuit though, you should get this DVD. It's more worth it than getting the VHS version :)
B000000H4V|5.0|SEPULTURA is not a death metal band they are 100% thrash. Only threir first two releases MORBID ANGEL and BESTAL DEVISTATION are death metal. Thats because of ANDREA KISSER joined and help them change direction. Now thats out of the way lets reveiw. This is one of their best work ever.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Mark Knopfler took  me on an interesting musical Journey with this album. Moving back and forth between Scotland and the South made me realize how simiar those two areas  are in culturaal terms+-
B000000H5K|3.0|This album is one of my least favorite and I'm a fan. This album is more nu-metal than thrash metal in the direction of I hate to say it KORN. I was greatly disapointed that they changed in sound and is the final record with Max Cavalera who I might add a great vocalist and songwriter, But their are some highlights like ROOTS BLOODY ROOTS heavy catchy powerhouse of a song, as well as ATTITUDE another in your face and like it type of song.....well lets face it the only great songs is in the first half of the cd. The rest is disapointing. Oh yeah dictators**t cool too.
B00006G8O1|5.0|I won't bore you with a synopsis, but will just say that this movie reminds me of The Wizard of Oz with a meds-ridden- Holden Caulfield replacing Dorothy.It's a great modern fairy tale/fable and it's obvious that a lot of love and heart went into the creation of the this story. Sure, there's interesting ideas and theories(albeit it confusing and little rushed) being thrown out in this movie that can allows you hours to speculate about the film's conclusion and multiple meanings. But the commentary on the human condition is what attracted me the most. In one therapy session, the psychiatrist mentions to Donnie that if the sky did open up one day and the world ended, all that would be left would be Donnie's memories, the choices he made, and the people he had touched. That line really sets you up to understand the ending(perhaps emotionally if not logically), and the haunting version of Tears For Fears &quot;Mad World&quot; just really emphasized that point. The sequence where that song is playing is just cinematically beautiful. Kelly is a natural storyteller and I'm excited to see what he comes up with next.ps(the whole smurf discussion is worth the video rental price alone!).
B00005JLU1|5.0|I love this movie. It is a good movie for teenagers and older.<BR>I have been watching this movie from like 4 years old. The actors in this movie are great for their parts. It is good because they show how different people can be, and how they react to others. What i like about this movie is, these two teenagers who one is bad boy and the other is a good girl who like each other but people dont like that they are together because they are different.  Its kind of romantic.  It shows u that u dont have to be the same to like someone. I think is was a great movie and johnny deep looks soo cute when he is young.

0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold slides easily into the world of a fourteen year old, and brought this reader back to what it feels like to be that age.  I am also a mother, and knowing the basics of this book (that involves the rape and murder of a young teenager), I was hesitant and somewhat anxious about the subject matter.  I was not prepared for the comforting, calm tone in which the narrator reveals her story.  It is the tone of the story that reveals Alice Sebold to be a fresh new writer.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is the best in the world. Avril Lavigne needs a little help on her lyrics but other than that the CD is AWESOME!! I have a collection of over 500 CD's and this is the only one that I can listen to every song on it!! If you do not have this CD then you are missing out on every thing that Avril has to offer. She has a beautiful voice, yet she can also rap and rock out. This is a must have for any CD collection. Whether it be a collection of two or three thousand. YOU MUST BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!
B000067G3C|5.0|After all these years seeing it in that ugly 4x3 Pan and Scan format, I finally broke down and bought the 5 Star Collection.  I'm very glad I did.  I always wished to see that movie in its original widescreen format, and now, my wish has come true.  It looks so much better this way.  The sound was a little different too.  Took a minute to readjust myself.  I'm very glad I made that investment to add to my small DVD collection.  Someday, I'll have a big collection.  GREAT MOVIE!!!
B0000636UN|2.0|\\"Steve McQueen\\" rocks... the rest of the album? ... I'd buy that single and wait for her Greatest Hits album to come out. Or better yet download her best songs. Soak Up The Sun is okay but the lyrics are sophmoric, \\"I've got noone to blame and everytime I feel lame I'm looking up.\\" ... And give us some more exciting people to collaborate with- Stevie Nicks sounds like a billy goat and she has turned Kid Rock into a pansy. \\"Steve McQueen\\" however- is Crow at her best. ... At one point thugh she vocalizes her obsession with her fear of being 40 and having to compete with sexy sassy 21 year old singers, i.e. \\"We've got rock stars in the white house and all our pop stars look like porn\\". [...] But still thanks to that song I didn't feel like a total fool for buying this album- that one line kind of ruins it though.
B00006AG5N|5.0|For those of us who have been enjoying the music Elvis left us - this CD is a treat.  No matter what some may say, Elvis was unique.  He didn't need to \\"steal\\" his style, moves or MUSIC from anyone.  Presley has affected virtually everyone in the music business in some way.  The list of admirers is staggering - everyone from Bing Crosby to Frank Sinatra to John & Paul to Brian Wilson to Ozzy!  The music of Elvis Presley has stood the test of time because of ONE thing - Elvis.  For the people that are not familiar with Elvis' music, this disc is a wonderful place to start.  Yes, the disc has flaws - but only because Elvis had many more # 1 hits in other countries and on other music charts (5 more on the country charts alone).  As so many others have written, the sound on this CD is just staggering.  This is the definitive Elvis Presley collection.  Listening to \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" conjures up images of desperate people walking slowly to their doom . . . not a common theme for early Rock and Roll.  The disc then brings you to \\"Don't be cruel\\" and \\"Hound dog\\".  This double-sided hit is not only the biggest selling single of all time; it is also the most played jukebox recording of all time.  Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Buddy Holly and many others were an integral part of the revolution we've come to know as \\"Rock and Roll\\" - but Elvis Presley was, is and will always be the king.  Forget the stupid jokes about the \\"fat\\" Elvis, the drugs and the ridiculous movies.  Just listen to the music.  In the end, that's all that matters.  From \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" to \\"A little less conversation\\" you will find that Elvis was much more than just a \\"Rock and Roll\\" singer.  The same cannot be said of Richard, Berry and many other rock originals. Some people contend that because Presley never wrote any of his own music, he does not deserve the praise he continually gets.  Does that mean since Bing Crosby didn't write \\"White Christmas\\" we should never listento it again or say Crosby didn't deserve to sell millions of copies of that record?  Before anybody did anything - Elvis did everything.  For new fans - please do not stop at this CD.  The next step is the \\"Sunrise\\" CD.  You will hear how and where Rock and Roll was born - and how a 19-year-old truck driver from Memphis became the biggest star the world has ever known.  Let the detractors have their say - but don't let their negativity dissuade you from finding the truth for yourself.  You won't be disappointed!
B000002HAJ|4.0|Even though I am a die-hard Cure fan, I can be fairly objective about their albums.  Upon first listening to WISH, I had trouble staying tuned to the complete album.  In the years since it's release, I have come to appreciate the beauty in its moody ballads and unique guitar rifts from having the opportunity to listen to it in depth during a summer road trip.  My favorite song would have to be A LETTER TO ELISE...  I even named my daughter Elise in honor of my favorite band!  <BR>This album did have some commercial success more so than other CURE albums perhaps more deserving due to the radio-friendly FRIDAY I'M IN LOVE, a catchy upbeat melody with a strong hook in the lyrics.  The album has continuity, making it a good listen from start to finish if you have the time.  Some tracks are more innovative, some more bland, but overall I would rate WISH with 4 out of 5 stars.
6305069611|4.0|First:<br />1. Fans of the novel may not like the film.  It takes a rather fragmented approach to the source material. But, for me, satisfying. It is a FILM ADAPTATION.<br />2. Bowie fans: no. He does not sing. There was no bootleg soundtrack. Most of the music Bowie wrote for this film wound up as Side 2 of &quot;Low&quot;.  MWFTE is effectively scored with top-notch music by Stomu Yamash'ta, and others.<br />3. Slackers brewing with envy at anything smacking of complexity or earnest pretension will probably hate it. The editing is purposefully oblique and strains towards seducing the viewer into an alien state of consiousness where time-skips and visual associations abound.  Viewers who need all their dots connected for them, will probably find it 'artsy-fartsy' and/or boring. If you like other Roeg films early in his career, you will love it. If you find Roeg 'pretentious', well, go watch something else.<br />4. MWFTE holds up pretty well 25 years hence. The photography will look hip again in about three years.  I still enjoy the musical selections a lot and wish a soundtrack had been released. <br />5. It's a rather simple story at heart: A man comes to this world and is seduced and betrayed by self-interested, fear-based humans. He understands all along how shallow and spineless most of them are - that they will likely betray and or crucify him despite all their sentiments - but he tries valiantly to get back to his celestial 'home'. In the end, they succeed in freezing their distorted lenses onto his eyes, and he gets stuck in a chat room staring at his navel (basically).
B000001DTM|5.0|I must admit, I was still in middle school when I bought U2's ACHTUNG BABY on tape.  I owned several other U2 albums, and upon listening to AB I was immediately impressed with the independent sound and atmosphere apart from their previous albums.  Many critics might disagree with me, but I believe AB was then and continues to remain the best U2 album in its entirety.  The JOSHUA TREE album was definitely the best U2 album at that time, but it lacks the omni-directional lyrics and sounds of ACHTUNG BABY.  <BR>This album is amazing because although each song is unique, stylistically and lyrically, the complete album has a sort of cohesiveness that makes it awesome when listened to as a whole, even though the individual tracks are outstanding alone.  No matter what mood you are in, or what sort of music you feel like listening to, you can pop in this tape/CD and it will pull you into their illustrative lyrics and imaginative sounds.<BR>Some songs are fun (MYSTERIOUS WAYS, EVEN BETTER THAN THE REAL THING), some songs more introspective (LOVE IS BLINDESS, ...WILD HORSES, ONE), some are just downright pleasurable to listen to (ULTRAVIOLET).  With AB, U2 changed their musical direction to include a wider variety of sounds and musical stylings, making this album the starting point for their more innovative ventures like ZOOROPA (which I did not care for at the time, but now enjoy occasionally).  <BR>I highly recommend this album to any serious or casual music fan.  There is not a single bad song on this album!  Even a decade later the album sounds as fresh and as powerful as it did when first I listened to it.
6305878323|5.0|A simply magical musical. Disney's finest. I enjoy this film more now than when I was a kid.  Exceptional digital and audio transfer.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This was clearly a star vehicle for Vin Diesel.  While the rest of the cast's work is just fine, the idea that Paul Walker is the center of this film is, well, ridiculous.  Without question, Diesel steals the show and is the magnetic core of the movie.  It could have been just another action/racing flick, but Diesel adds a depth and charm to the character of Dom that you wouldn't expect.  Truly a fun film....and great for Diesel drooling.  He's a serious actor, but man is he s-e-x-y too, ladies.  Real star power.  He'll be around for long time.
B000002UB3|5.0|I'm a relatively new Beatles fan, so I've been accumulating their albums one by one. I think that Abbey Road is their best and most startling production. Their early albums are the beginning of their development, so I'll focus on 1965-1970. Rubber Soul (1965) is, in my opinion, their second best album, as it is an understated transformation from mop tops to legendary songwriters. Drive My Car, The Word, and Michelle are classics. Revolver (1966) is #3 for me, a true accomplishment with songs like Eleanor Rigby and its open creativity. Still, not as cohesive as Rubber Soul. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) is a hard one for me. It's got some great songs (Title tracks, When I'm Sixty-Four, and A Day in the Life), but I just don't feel \\"it\\" throughout the album. <br />The White Album (1968) is another hard one, because it is primarily an individual showcase and therefore, I don't believe it should be considered for their best album as a group effort. Let it Be (1970), actually not their last album, is a fun and sort of disorganized collection of songs (Get Back and title song). Underrated, but still not their most complete effort. Finally, we come to Abbey Road, an inexplicably cohesive and exhilarating experience when you think about the fact that these guys didn't like each other at this point.<br />From the opening classic Come Together (ironically they did) to the string of fragmented wonders (Golden Slumbers,Carry That Weight, and The End) that showcase a level of harmony and energy that is not matched anywhere in the Beatles considerable repertoire, Abbey Road is a true music masterpiece. I don't know how they did it, but it's a testament to their ability as musicians and their love of music to pull off something like this with their personal conflict at its height. Bottom line, the Beatles are the greatest band in history, their albums all heads and shoulders above nearly everything that's come after them. It's impossible to pick a \\"best\\" without itbeing soley based on preference of a certain approach the Beatles took to a particular album because all the songs rock.<br />My pick: Abbey Road. Your pick: whichever one speaks to you.
B00006AG5N|5.0|The fidelity and sound are improved and the \\"king\\" has never sounded better.  This album proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that the poor country boy from Tupelo Mississippi was the \\"original\\" and everyone who came after him were \\"also rans\\".  He took the elements of blues, country, hillbilly and Southern gospel and created a new and unique sound that will never be outdated.  Where other singers might have had one or two of the afore mentioned elements, Elvis was the first to combine them all.  This album will be a delight to older fans and show the new and younger fans that it was indeed Elvis started the rock n' roll craze.  Elvis did not need the hype of electronic soundboard tweeking; overdubbing, multi- tracking, echo chambers and synthesized back up to create great records as do the so called \\"artists\\" of today.  His early Sun recordings, with just his voice and rhythm back up, are as simple and pure as you can get and they remain \\"classics\\".  No artist since has had the combination of God given talent: voice, looks, personality, stage presence and charisma that was Elvis Presley.  Maybe once or twice in a lifetime does there appear a giant in select fields of music.  In pop it was the incomparable Frank Sinatra.  In classical music it was Mario Lanza and now the incredible Charlotte Church.  In country it was Jim Reeves and Patsy Cline.   In rock it was Elvis.  Now, twenty five years after his untimely death, he is still setting chart records and winning new fans and admirers.  I can only hope that there will be a 2nd remastered album of more of his unmatched million sellers that didn't make it on this album.  Long live the \\"King\\"!
B000002J29|5.0|This live recording has to be one of the best recordings one could ever want to hear. The intensity of the music stands alone but the balance of sound from every member of the band allows one to not only hear the music but to feel the music. This is an album that can be listened to time and time again without becoming tiresome. When one listens to 'Seconds Out', they become part of the concert audience themselves. From the opening sounds of the crowd anxiously awaiting the start of the concert, followed by a sudden intro of 'Sqounk', to the ever intense finale of 'Los Endos', the sounds are incredible. The album allows one to become completely part of a story-book fantasy. One can lose oneself in this album with the haunting, crisp, hair-raising performance by Phil, Steve, Tony, Mike, Chester and Bill. Each individual is as strong as the next on this album. The drum sections are so wonderfully performed, it makes one want to instantly go out and by a drum set, just to play the ending drum sections of 'Los Endos', let alone the drum duet of Chester and Phil. Tony's playing, especially on 'The Cinema Show' is beyond words. His keyboard playing is at its best and defines Genesis to this day. Steve's playing will never be duplicated. His 'haunting' approach and sound are to say the least, original and intriguing. He leaves every part of his heart and soul out there for everyone to hear. Mike's playing is as solid and righteous as it could ever be. And who could forget the incredible performance of Phil. From the extremes of shouting on 'The Musical Box' to the quiet tones on 'The Carpet Crawl', he shows the wonderful range and dynamics of his voice, not to mention his strength in the percussion section, especially on 'Los Endos'. The music stands alone - period. But if one has ever had the opportunity to not only hear this incredible music, but to view this incredible band, live, with their never-before-seen light show, one could NOT possibly ask for a better combination of sights and sounds. Goose-bumps all around for this album. Wonderfully done by everyone involved. Thanks for making my life more enjoyable with this album, with 25 years of listening. It stirs every emotion in you. INTENSE !!
B00005JXY3|4.0|This was the best sequel in the series. This had a lot of Action and Drama. This takes place right where the first left off, Daniel(Ralph Macchio) won the tournament and he and Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita) are about to go home until they see Kreese(Martin Kove) looking very furious at Johnny(William Zabka) for loosing the tournament. Mr. Miyagi stops Kreese and humiliates him as well. SIX MONTHS LATER, Daniel finds out that Ali(Elisabeth Shue, but she is only in the first) dumped him for someone else. He also learns that he gets to stay with Mr. Miyagi for the Summer! Mr. Miyagi then gets a note from Okinawa and finds out that his father is very sick. So Daniel and Mr. Miyagi travel to Okinawa and runs into Sato(Danny Kamekona), Miyagi's childhood enemy. Sato challenges Miyagi to a fight but Miyagi refuses. Daniel has also made a new enemy, Chozen(Yuji Okumoto) who is Sato's nephew. Miyagi also find his old girlfriend Yukie(Nobu McCarthy) and Daniel finds Yukie's niece Kumiko(Tamilyn Tomita). Sato threatens to tear Miyagi's old town down if he won't fight him and Daniel must also fight Chozen for honor, too. This was also another good Drama and I'll say it again, It had a lot of Action.
B000002UTY|5.0|Thanks much on the heads up on the Cd version of QMS live Happy Trails review. Have this on old cassette that has seen or played better days and it still probably sounds better than the CDS you purchased. Noticed there are quite a few out there  that are that way
0800179501|5.0|This was a wonderful Action/Drama. It is directed by John G. Avildsen(Rocky). This movie is about a 17 year old named Daniel LaRusso(Ralph Macchio) who moves from Newark, New Jersey to Southern California with his mother(Randee Heller). When Daniel is invited to a beach party, he falls for Ali(Elisabeth Shue) a beautiful blonde girl. Daniel later gets into a fight with Johnny(William Zabka), a bully from a Karate group named the Cobra Kai. Then when school starts, Daniel becomes a target for the Cobra Kai and start to bully him many times(Soccer, Biking, on Halloween). Then Mr. Miyagi(Pat Morita) an Apartment Handyman from Okinawa, leaps to Daniel's defense. Then when Kreese(Martin Kove) becomes upset at Miyagi, he challenges him. Mr. Miyagi accepts the challenge at the Karate Tournament and that gives Mr. Miyagi two Months to train Daniel. This movie had great action and acting. I highly reccomend this.
B000002UAX|5.0|If you haven't already heard The White Album-- what is the matter with you?  Even if you aren't a fan of rock music, you should find something you like on this two-disc/two-album set. The White Album contains everything from reggae to heavy metal to pop to punk to country to blues to lullabies.

B00006AFUR|3.0|30STM is definately not a bad band by any means, in fact I love their album. The only reason I took away two stars is for the fact that they TOTALLY ripped of Deadsys concept and image.  Members represented by symbols, the synth, the latin moto, the name for their followers, jared has been studying them (Deadsy) for years so he could lay down a similar format for his band, however he moved away from it being gothic, and changed the theme to space. Despite my grudge, it is a good cd.  Its more taylor made for the masses than Deadsy. Its baisically a futuristic version of Deadsy, but a good one at least.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a good album. She sings great. She is also very cute! You may make fun of me. I don't care. But the best tracks on here are: Complicated and Sk8er Boy. These songs are great.

Thanks guys for listening and reding my review. You guys rock if you get this CD. Go get it NOW! You are missing out on a great album. Go and get it. Or else!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I read in another review something along the lines of: &quot;A wonderful movie which is emotionally draining, and should not be considered entertainment&quot;.  Well, I somewhat agree with that.  This is one of the better movies that I have seen in a while, and the only movie in which I felt so strongly for the characters.  This movie evoked such emotions from me that no movie ever has (or even should for that matter).  That is how I know it is good!  Somewhat depressing however, if you watch it alone, go out after and have a good time...trust me, you'll need it!  Enjoy!!
B0000683DH|5.0|Though THE MOTION PICTURE began the Trek movie endeavors, it was STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN that really brought out the best for Trek fans everywhere. With magnificent battles, thrilling special effects, and the superb acting of Ricardo Montablan, THE WRATH OF KHAN is a thrill-ride from start to finish. I also liked seeing Kirstey Alley as Lt. Saavik, and she does a surprisingly nice job as the curious and charming Saavik. And Berritt Mutrick does a splendid job as the son of Kirk. <br />THE WRATH OF KHAN deals with the story of Khan's return, and his plans to snag his hands on the Genesis Project for his own deadly plans, and when he hijacks the USS Reliant and its crew, Kirk and the crew must stop him before it's too late. The battle scenes, especially in the Motara Nebula, are brilliant, and well done. You'll find yourself satisfied after you watch this movie, and left with a feeling that it got more than just it's job done for all the Trek fans.<br />THE WRATH OF KHAN also concludes with the \\"temporary\\" death of Spock, who gave his marbles to McCoy so that it would be possible to revive him in the next movie, THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK. Exhilirating, fast-paced, and with great savvy intelligence, this is one Trek you'll want to watch again and again! Highly recommended!
B00006AUIG|5.0|Written by Brad Anderson & Stephen Gevedon; Directed by Brad Anderson (ASIN: B00005UQ9F) <BR>Reviewed by Shikhar Dixit<br /> The best rule for a horror story is \\"Don't show the monster.\\" Alfred Hitchcock knew it. Robert Wise (The Haunting, 1963) knew it. Director Brad Anderson has mastered it. Much like the original version of The Haunting, Session 9 also takes advantage of another great rule in horror: \\"Atmosphere, atmosphere, atmosphere.\\" The camera drifts around corners and into the harsh shadows of Danvers State Mental Hospital, a real hospital and portrayed in its genuinely rundown condition. <BR> <BR> Gordon Fleming, played eerily spot-on by Scottish actor Peter Mullan, leads the team of Hazmat Elimination Co. into the vacant corpse of a once prominent mental institution famous for its invention of the pre-frontal lobotomy. Their job is filthy, dangerous and stressful--to strip all the carcinogenic asbestos insulation from the building before its imminent refurbishing one week later. David Caruso, Stephen Gevedon, Josh Lucas, and Brendan Sexton III round out the cast as the rest of the elimination team, each hinting at the shortcomings that have landed them in this hellish job. The promise of a $10,000 bonus hanging just beyond reach, they set out to clean the facility. <br /> But Danvers State also holds it own attractions. For Mike (Stephen Gevedon,) it is the taped sessions with a psychotic patient named Mary Hobbes. For Hank (Josh Lucas,) it is the stash of old coins and trinkets he discovers hidden in the walls. For Phil (David Caruso,) it is perhaps the ultimate ownership of Hazmat Elimination Co. And for Gordon, it is something far more unsettling and not altogether natural.<br /> Perhaps the most imposing character in the film is Danvers State Mental Hospital itself. Shaped like a bat, with a once administrative area branching off into \\"wings,\\" the farthest reaches of this enormous creature were reserved for the most severely psychotic cases...cases like Mary Hobbes.<br /> An effective use of foreshadowing, steady rise in tension, masterful cinematography and a group of solid character-actors makes Session 9 the best film to grace an otherwise flagging genre since, well, The Haunting.<br /> The DVD (from USA Home Entertainment) contains the 100-minute feature film in letterbox, Deleted Scenes (including a wisely rethought alternate ending,) Story-to-Screen storyboard comparisons, Director's Commentary (with blessed on/off feature,) a chilling theatrical trailer, and the fascinating featurette, \\"The Haunted Palace,\\" a look at the very real location and some of the art inspired by it. <br /> This review is for the Region 1 encoded DVD with English Closed Captioning and Dolby Digital Stereo.
B00005JKHP|4.0|Some people regard STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE as a boring, and rather dull feature film. However, I feel that this is a great film, and the pacing may be slower than other Trek movies, but this has all the ingredients for a potentially great Trek movie. The only thing missing from this particular movie is more action (meaning, more ship-to-ship battles). But otherwise, this slow-burner is imaginative, intelligent, and remarkable in the visual effects department. And, more so in this updated version, the special effects are even better. Plus, you've got the thoroughly enjoyable cast from the original series and some newcomers aboard. <br />STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is a good movie, as long as you are willing to have patience to watch it, carefully, and to realize that in the end, you can easily see why now 9 other movies have followed in the steps of the one that started it all.
B00005YXZH|2.0|Having never heard of Wilco before this little album might somehow qualify me as a non-entity in terms of being valid.  But even so, I must weigh in on the YHF debate.  I've never been a fan of the vague lyrics of the so-called poets of today.  And these are no exception, its basically lets make this rhyme time, if it doesn't make sense it doesn't matter, we're important.  If you're going to make nonsensical lyrics, make it so I can't understand what you're saying, don't go all Dylan on me Tweedy, you ain't no Dylan.  \\"I'm trying to break your heart\\" is the best example.  With lines like \\"I, assassin down the avenue\\" and \\"Take your band-aid off, cause I don't believe in touchdowns\\" it's a wonder anyone cares what the music sounds like.  Which I will give credit for, its a catchy type of album, but in an effervescent sort of way, as in I like it but I don't remember it, and usually the songs go on to long anyway.  The funniest thing is that this album is being pegged as \\"difficult\\" which is pretty laughably absurd, I could picture a song like Kamera being on the radio and a lot of people liking it.  Its just pop music people.  And all the hoopla regarding the record company and their supposed screw-up, all just ended up being a self-serving publicity campaign, rock on.  Well, my opinion is simple, I gave it a chance, too much of one, probably two or three, and surprisingly the album actually got worse, which is kind of strange, since most reviews see it as a grower.  Oh well, I guess I'm not sophisicated enough for the rest of you.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30 seconds to Mars is a wonderful album. It is something totally original and is a new sound. The lyrics are unique and took me to a place i've never been before. I recommend to all.
B000067CPX|5.0|I'd definetely say that BTW is the best cd ever.  Seriously if you dont like it, go do yourself to 'give it away' but if you want the best the chilis have to offer, pick this masterpiece up
B00003CXXS|2.0|Except for maybe another fat paycheck, right?  That's about all I can figure for why a fine actor like Sam Neill returned to this fast-dying franchise for another go-around.  Now the 'Jurassic Park' movies in general require you to take on an enormous amount of disbelief, but even knowing this, this is an ugly, and pretty bad movie.  The original 'Jurassic Park' was a bona fide popcorn classic that I saw upwards of five or six times in the theater.  When the sequel 'The Lost World - Jurassic Park Part II' rolled around it was already starting to feel like the thrills were cheap and the cheese was being laid on a little thick, especially the ridiculous final quarter when it went stateside.  However, when I saw the trailer for this one, I was admittedly somewhat looking forward to it.<br />Now I and every other film buff should know by now that when a franchise is going on for a third chance, that you can't expect much from it, especially a thriller like this, that is, in some sense of the phrase, a natural disaster movie.  I mean how many times can these humans go back to this island, watch their friends get mauled and eaten, just BARELY escape themselves, and still, STILL have an inkling to go back.  Of course, you can't really blame Dr. Grant in this one, because he was kind of forced into the situation here, and William H. Macy and Tea Leoni just wanted their son back, but all the rest of 'em, good God, what're they thinking?  <br />You can always tell who's going to become dinosaur food in these movies, because there's always a few characters thrown into the mix that don't seem to have any purpose at all, or that are as weakly-developed as you can possibly imagine, but in this one, it seemed everyone was expendable really.  I mean, I didn't care about any of them, except for Dr. Grant, and I almost wished he would die just to put him out of his misery.  Even the special effects in this one, handled once again by ILM, are weak and so obviously phony that the thrills are more laughable than anything.  To break it down for you, there was just too much cheese in this movie for me to stomach.  I'd say it definitely supports dairy.  <br />I give 'Jurassic Park III' two stars for Sam Neill's performance, and for the sequence in the bird's nest, where the pterodactyls were pecking at the kid.  Pretty sad, huh?  One good thing I can say is that the movie was only about 89 minutes long compared to the two hours-plus that the others were.  The producers and screen writers must know that the material is getting stale.  I hope they don't make any more of these movies.
6305508550|4.0|If you have ever worked for a corporation and had to be in a cubicle, this movie will make you laugh and laugh.  I found it incredibly funny, and some of the moments were priceless.  Recommended to anyone working at a large corporation, you will just get it and it will be funny.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|And I don't mean interesting like 'documentary' interesting, like it's going to enlighten you, or present some interesting factual information for you to ponder about an' write some long essay on.  It's not gonna do anything like that for you.  When I say interesting, I mean it is a wholly exciting and interesting concept of a movie, the likes of which I definitely did not see coming when I first popped it in my DVD player.  My mom was the one who told me that I would like this movie, an' I was willing to go along an' watch it even though I had my doubts.  Okay, lemme quit lyin' to y'all, I was TOTTALLY and UTTERLY against watching this movie.  I had absolutely NO desire at all to sit through what looked to me like a big, flashy, overblown, feature-length music video with actors and actresses that I didn't even really care for too much (aside from John Leguizamo).  It didn't help either that it was under the helm of eccentric director Baz Luhrmann, whose take on 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' was I thought one of the most thoughtless, ridiculous and insignificant movies of recent years (I didn't see 'Strictly Ballroom' so I can't comment on that one).<br />Okay, so it's safe to say I was anything but thrilled about the notion of watching this movie.  What I found when I finally swallowed my pride and watched it was that, well, I was wrong and way too quick to judge.  Okay, it's flashy, it's flamboyant, and it DEFINITELY requires a LOT of suspension of disbelief on the viewers' parts.  But, there is something really special at the heart of this movie with it's simple love story centered around a poor writer's insatiable love for the star dancer, who is basically unattainable unless the price is right.  During a chance encounter, the details of which are too funny to spoil, the poor writer feels that they shared something special together.  Though she denies it at first, she felt it too.  Both believe deeply in their love, but can't find a way to overcome the obstacles betweenthem.  She is promised to marry someone else and he, well, he's poor.  And has no clout.  Hearing songs by Elton John and John Lennon and numerous other contemporary artists as the soundtrack for a story set in 1890's Paris with everything from beautiful-looking theaters to an array of can-can dancers to the dwarf artist Toulouse-Lautrec, played by JOhn Leguizamo, who is an amazingly talented and underrated actor and performer.  The highlight for me was definitely seeing the ringmaster, played by Jim Broadbent, and the dastardly Duke, played by Richard Roxburg, sing 'Like a Virgin'.  That was absolutely hilarious.<br />All I can say is, if you haven't seen 'Moulin Rouge', you're really missing out.  This is Nicole Kidman's best role ever.
0767827791|5.0|Everything was done right in this classic motion picture. The wonderful script, superb actors, brilliant music score and a wonderful story and a director who really knew how to get the most out of his cast.This motion picture is the likes of what will never come out of Hollywood again. Kim Novak was not only beautiful but could melt any man with here beautiful eyes. The most famous scene where she is dancing at the Labor Day picnic and the seductive theme music playing in the background still is the most sexual scene ever film while still wearing clothes. This kind of acting will never be seen again nor is there talent today in Hollywood to recreate this.The surround channels are bright, brilliant but suttle enough to give you that engulfing sound that just makes you curl-up in your chair a little tighter.  This is one of the only movies that makes you feel the pasion as if you were right in the movie yourself.This movie has been brilliantly restored and unlike the review, i give the picture and sound a 5.  A must for any collector and a national treasure.
0451527712|5.0|This book is scary - in a good way. As set apart from the typical notion of Frankenstein as a green monster with nails sticking out of his head, the true daemon was pale yellow, with flowing black hair. While many people have interpreted the novel in different ways, I feel it depicts three main points:<br /><br />1) Excessive desire for knowledge is not a good thing, as it leads to a lower appreciation of the beauty of the world. As a child, Victor Frankenstein enjoyed looking on the beautiful mountains and hills of his native Switzerland, but then he got deep into science and the secret of life. And this led him to a gloominess in life, and a lack of wonder at the world. While working on creating the creature, he says, \\"It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.\\"<br /><br />2) Man's sinfulness always passes down to his creation, and the results are horrific. I am a Christian who believes man is sinful at heart, and I saw a dramatic illustration of this principle in Frankenstein. The sins of Victor Frankenstein passed down to his creature, and eventually it destroyed his friends, his family, and even himself. Says Frankenstein, \\"I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done [his murder of Frankenstein's brother], nearly in the light of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.\\"<br /><br />3) Man is responsible to care for the things he creates, or else the results are dreadful. Once Frankenstein breathed life into his creature, he immediately was struck with horror and regret at what he had done, and he abdicated his responsibility to guide it. The creature consequently turned into a miserable, vengeful brute. He says, \\"I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\\"<br /><br />I believe this novel is worth reading to gain a sense of horror at these points. It should lead us to continually appreciate the world's beauty, to always repent of our sin, and to take care of our creations, especially our children.<br /><br />If you don't read the book for these points, then just read it for a good story. It's truly fantastic. :-)mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavignes 'Let Go' is the best CD i have ever bought. Her passion and talent shines through in these songs that she wrote herself. She is my new favourite artist and i haven't stopped listening to her CD. I love every single song..they all have this really unique sound. Losing Grip, Mobile, Things I'll Never Say and Naked are my faves on here and this album should be owned by everyone out there. Avril Lavigne rocks!
B00004R9A4|5.0|Bedknobs and Broomsticks is my favorite Disney movie ever created. However, it is also one of the most overlooked ones as well. I've watched this movie since I was a little child, and you never get bored of it. One childhood memory I have, is watching this movie with my family. Now, I watch this 30th Anniversary DVD with my baby brother. Now I'll tell you all what this classic is about.<br />Bedknobs and Broomsticks is about a middle aged apprentice witch named Eglantine Price who lives in 1940 England. She is ordered to watch after 3 children who have been evacuated from London. The kids find out Miss Price's secret, and they also find out that Miss Price learns witchcraft from a mailorder course. To make a pact that states that if they keep her secret, she'll make it worth her while. So, she enchants a brass bedknob that will make them go wherever they want. However, the school closes, without the most important final spell, the Subsitutiary Locomotion spell. <br />So, using the bedknob, they go to London and seek out the headmaster of the school, Emelius Brown. Mr Brown can't find the spell either because the book he got out the spell of is torn, and the spell is only found on a necklace of a sorcerer named Astoroth.<br />Anyway, they go to Portobello Road, like a mini mall, and learn that towards the end of Astoroth's life, he captured animals and kept them in cages to make them more human like. The animals rebelled and killed Astoroth and stole the necklace. The animals escaped and took refuge on a mythical Isle named Niboombu.<br />The animation starts know as the tiny group explore the sea and then the island using hte traveling bedknob, and get the necklace that has the spell on it after a fun soccer game with a lion, which almost ends our story. After getting the necklace and returning home, the Nazi soldiers attack, and using the Spell, Miss Price and Company defeat them.<br />Now, I highly reccomend this DVD because of its digitally restored and digitallyremastered format, and the resolution is so clear. This also has one of the best climaxes in Disney history, when they fight the Nazi's, and also has great animation.<br />As Mr Brown says, \\"Do it with a Flair\\", and get this 30th anniversary DVD, Digitally Restored and Remastered and Ready to Go!
B00003CXB2|5.0|This 1962 film is based on the true story of the unconventional British Lieutenant, who, during WW1, united Arab tribes to fight on the British side against the Turks.  How Lawrence did that was the result of his weird combination of charisma and  craziness.  And how director, David Lean, brought this epic to the screen is a result of pure genius.  Filmed on location in Jordan, the desert comes alive for the viewer.  It's mile after mile after mile of drifting sand.  But it also has places where there are lots of little rocks.  And then there are the few and far-between oases and wells.  There's danger here too, both because of the bitter tribal rivalries as well as natural dangers such as quicksand.  The camel is the accepted mode of transportation.  And thirst is something that the Bedouins learned to live with.  It's a harsh life.  The film is full of adventure.  And not just because of the characters or the action.  There's the adventure of the desert itself, and how a small speck on the horizon comes out of a mirage and becomes a human being.  This all comes alive by a vision, one that had never been done on screen before.  It was an ambitious undertaking. And a huge success.<br />The acting was outstanding.  And so were all the special effects, although the cast of thousands who were real live people.  It's a refreshing difference to computer-generated scenes we've become accustomed to.  And a type of filming that we will not likely see again.  For that alone, the film stands as a testament to human ingenuity.  A couple of details bothered me, such as the makeup on Peter O'Toole whose fair skin was supposed to look sunburned, but somehow looked as if he had thick clay on his face.  But this was minor. I also thought the film was too long and missed a traditional arc of plot which I've come to expect.  I found myself drowsing off during the last half hour as it all seemed repetitive and superfluous to what had come before.<br />I watched all the DVD special features the next morning.  And they were wonderful.  It was then I realized that the print I had watched had been restored in 1989, with 35 minutes added to the epic.  Some of the sound had been lost at that time and I found it fascinating as to how they brought back the actors to dub in their own voices again.  I love learning about all the background and hearing the actors talk about the experience. Don't miss this wonderful DVD.  Just make sure that you give yourself enough time to watch the film in its entirety.  And add on another couple of hours to see the special features.  You'll come away with an experience of your own that goes beyond merely watching a film.  Clearly, it rates one of my highest recommendations.eatures the next morning.  And they were wonderful.

Her love for Jazz evolved while attending Dallas' Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. She then majored in jazz piano at the University of North Texas for two years.<br /><br />She then took a trip to New York and while this started as a summer vacation, Norah was soon found herself hanging around local songwriters and became inspired to write some original songs.<br /><br /> \\"The music scene is so huge. I found it very exciting. I especially enjoyed hearing amazing songwriters at places like The Living Room. Everything opened up for me. I couldn't leave.\\"<br /><br />She has performed with the Laszlo band and in Wax Poetic. Eventually she joined a band with local songwriter Jesse Harris where she sang and played piano.<br /><br />In January 2001 she signed with Blue Note Records. This is her first Blue Note release and was produced by Arif Mardin, Jay Newland and Craig Street.<br /><br />Norah includes classic tunes from Hank Williams', \\"Cold, Cold Heart,\\"  J.D. Loudermilk's \\"Turn Me On,\\" and Hoagy Charmichael's \\"The nearness of You.\\" Then she delights with originals by her bandmates. Jesse Harris', \\"Don't Know Why\\" and Lee Alexander, \\"Seven Years\\" are beautiful songs that leave you so nostalgic for the past, yet they are new songs.<br /><br />She is inspired by the music of yesterday and loves Aretha Franklin, Willie Nelson and Ray Charles.<br /><br />I can't believe she has just tuned 23!<br /><br />Ok, so I listened to this CD about 10 times today! Here is what I think of each song:<br /><br />Don't Know Why - A slow seduction of words that evoke a feeling of absolute longing, yet a certain resolution instead of taking action.<br /><br />Seven Years - Innocence personified.<br /><br />\\"Fragile as a leaf in autumn<br />Just fallin' to the ground<br />Without a sound\\"<br /><br />Cold Cold Heart - Norah's voice melts this silky smooth song.<br /><br />Feelin' The Same Way - Nice twisty little number that seems to spin in circles. This song brings out the smoky elements in her voice.<br /><br />Come Away With Me - The pace drops to melting snow. It is terribly romantic as she sings of wanting to wake up with the rain falling on a tin roof in the arms of the one she loves.<br /><br />Shoot The Moon - Moody Blue Song.<br /><br />Turn Me On - The pace picks up and Norah sings of a flower waiting to bloom and a light bulb in a dark room. Cute song actually. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Lonestar - Country flavor. She wishes for a sign in the night sky.<br /><br />I've Got to See You Again - Pure seduction. Norah's voice really comes alive in this song. I'm thinking this is what we can look forward to in the future!<br /><br />Painter Song - Fun, dreamy melody about being a painter. French caf&eacute; flair fantasy about being in a painting.<br /><br />One Flight Down - Almost matter-of-fact. Norah's voice is very clear in this song and quite strong. I like trying to figure out Jesse Harris' song with all their secret meanings.<br /><br />Nightingale - Almost has a lullaby quality.<br /><br />The Long Day is Over - Perhaps the slowest song, perfect to fall asleep to.<br /><br />The Nearness of You - Then, this will wake you up a bit, yet it still has a sleepy and breathy quality.<br /><br />Smooth Sexy Selections in a Dreamy World of Jazz, Soul and Country.

B00005JKTF|3.0|Starring Cate Blanchett as a young Scottish woman who joins the French resistance during WW2, this should have been a good film.  But someone made the ridiculous decision to have her speak English the entire time, even though there is a big deal made about how her character speaks fluent French.  Immediately  I was turned off as I've learned to expect at least this basic  degree of authenticity in films.<br />I must say though that the cinematography was wonderful; it brought me right into war-torn France.  I even learned a little bit about what it must have been like to live under the German occupation.  But the lead character's love of a British pilot that brings her to France in the first place, and her relationship with a French resistance fighter, played by Billy Crudup, just didn't sparkle.  And I've seen similar films about Nazi cruelty and Jewish deportation before.<br />Ms. Blanchett is pretty; and her wardrobe seemed authentic for the period.  But her lipstick was just a little too perfect and detracted from any emotion in her face. There was plenty of tension throughout but I was not emotionally moved.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I am 15 years old and i still love disney. My whole family loved this movie ,even my skeptical mom. The animation was superb and every deatail was put in from fur to boo's child like face. Boo acted just like a child would in real life it was amazing. The plot is intriguing and even suprising in some parts. Great Disney movie for once!
0451197968|4.0|I decided to take another look at the \\"Richard Bachman\\" novel \\"The Running Man,\\" because I wanted to check and see how much Ben Affleck and Matt Damon had been ripping it off last year with their idea for a reality game show contestants tried to get from point \\"A\\" to point \\"B\\" with the entire nation keeping their eye out for them to cash in on a reward.  The show got the plugged pulled on it after 9/11 and somehow the punch line to that particular story ends up being \\"Push, Nevada,\\" but that is not important right now.<br />Ben Richards lives in a futuristic bleak America where his only hope of getting the money he needs to take his daughter to a doctor, is to be \\"lucky\\" enough to get a spot on one of the big television game shows.  Ben hits the jackpot and becomes the contestant on \\"The Running Man.\\"  The rules are fairly simple: you are given a head start and head off into the world where the government will give $10,000 to anybody who kills you.  Add to that the show's hunters, who will be in hot pursuit as well, and it is no wonder that no one has every survived the one month necessary to \\"win\\" the game.  Of course, \\"The Running Man\\" has never had a contestant like Ben Richards before.<br />Anyhow, \\"The Running Man\\" is what they would have called a potboiler in the old days.  The gimmick is how each of the 100 chapters countdown to the thrilling climax (a ploy Dickie Bachman likes a lot if you remember what the author did in \\"Thinner\\").  Reading \\"The Running Man\\" reminds me of watching \\"Survivor,\\" (albeit with a killer twist on the old \\"Queen for a Day\\" game show) because the chief fun with each is wondering what you would do in that selfsame predicament.  The original game concept is a lot more interesting than the lame version they came up with for the movie version, which was more a take off on \\"American Gladiators\\" to suit the peculiar talents of star Arnold Schwarzenegger.  This is a quick and easy read, which is exactly what you want with a plot like this one.<br />Final note, if you read this one you might as well do its evil twin, \\"The Long Walk.\\"  If not taken separately certainly when considered together these two stories will convince you that Mark Burnett does not have anything on Stephen King when it comes to creating reality game shows.

The book is a complete course in personal development. It offers simple solution to the things like procrastination, goal setting, attitude management. I have tremendously benefitted and will definitely recommend it to you.
6304981635|5.0|This movie is so dumb, but yet, it's still good. The story is so stupid, you'll laugh the whole way through, but watching Bruce Lee fight is enough to make up for the [smelly] plot. The acting is pretty cheap, since all the main actors are martial artists, and not actors by profession. However, when you watch it, you'll either laugh your way through, or be amazed by Bruce Lee's skill. Either way, you'll probably enjoy this one. Try it out.
B00004SZWD|5.0|For those who care to know, this is my 1,000th review (ladies and gentlemen, please hold your applause!), and I thought it'd be a good idea to revisit Stevie Wonder's still-influential masterpiece &quot;Songs in the Key of Life.&quot;  Yeah, he's turned in other classics, and I'm also fond of &quot;Music of My Mind&quot; and &quot;Hotter Than July,&quot; but &quot;Songs...&quot; ranks up there with &quot;The Beatles&quot; and Prince's &quot;Sign o the Times&quot; as one of the greatest double albums ever released.  I still have the original vinyl edition (left to me by my late father), and very little of the material sounds dated, but all of it ranges from &quot;excellent&quot; to &quot;even better.&quot;  Wonder is most effective when he sings about love, as evidenced on the still-groovy &quot;As&quot; (which George Michael and Mary J. Blige would later cover), the brilliant &quot;Knocks Me off My Feet&quot; (which Tevin Campbell would later cover), and the ever-memorable &quot;Isn't She Lovely.&quot;  Other songs that hold a place close to my heart are &quot;Another Star,&quot; &quot;Sir Duke,&quot; and the soaring &quot;If it's Magic.&quot;  More than a quarter century since its release, this album has lost none of its luster.  A classic album as towering as &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; isn't simply music.  It's also history.
0780622545|4.0|The concept was wonderful. The casting was superb. The movie was like an outline of what it could have been. They could have done so much more to develop the characters to their potential, and turn a good movie into a great one. Nevertheless, I bought it, as an example of true imagination...and awesome special effects.
B000002LCX|4.0|&quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot; is the unexpected swan song of the Smiths, who disbanded in the months following the completion of this album.  While it doesn't quite reach the heights of &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot; or their debut, there's enough to remind us why we fell in love with this Manchester group in the first place.  Singer Morrissey gives us his twisted sense of humor in the single &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma,&quot; makes a nail-on-the-head commentary on the recording industry's greed in &quot;Paint a Vulgar Picture,&quot; and delivers a fine closer, the haunting &quot;I Won't Share You.&quot;  But &quot;Strangeways&quot;'s peak is the potent &quot;Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me.&quot;  After a piano solo that seems to go on forever, the song blasts into a dramatic rocker in which Morrissey moans: &quot;Last night I felt/ real arms around me/ No hope, no harm/ Just another false alarm.&quot;  With four studio albums within 4 years, The Smiths have secured a place in pop as one of the most beloved and influential groups of all time.  &quot;Strangeways&quot; only confirms that belief.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!!Very imaginative, excellent portrayal of characters, very believable storyline. The ending is very twisted and the special effects are amazing. Most of the time, movies that don't get the media hype, are the best to see.  I had originally rented this and once I saw it I HAD to add it to my DVD collection.  Movies like this one, are far and few between.  The soundtrack is amazing, with an excellent cover of the  Tears for Fears song \\"Mad World\\".<BR>Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the best new actors out there, also stars his sister Maggie.  Drew Barrymore, Noah Wyle, Jena Malone, and Patrick Swayze are also in this, they bring a lot of life to their characters.  DVD features a lot of bonus material like deleted scenes, trailers and more on the philosophy of time travel.  Their is a link to the website ... that is a definate must see.  ARE YOU CONVINCED YET?! Run now and buy this DVD!
B00003CXSP|4.0|Hannibal isn't Silence of the Lambs, and there's a reason for that-it's not supossed to be. While I could write a whole review on the comparrisons Hannibal gets to Silence, I won't do that. There's really no reason to do so. There are two totally different movies.<br />What I will say about the two is that though Hannibal is a sequel, it really is only a sequel in terms of the characters of Clarise Starling and Hannibal Lector. There's no Jack Crawford or Buffalo Bill. That's pretty much it. That's one of the reasons this movie deserves more credit that it gets, is because it works without not having seen \\"Silence\\", though it works better have seeing it. <br />To sum up the plot, Hannibal is a movie about Hannibal Lector. Out. Around. And no cell to hold him this time. This time Hannibal is living in Italy and is enjoying the finer things in life. All is going well for Dr. Lector untill a vengeful past victim puts Lector back up on the FBI's most wanted list thanks to his wealth. Agent Starling(who is no longer a rookie, and it shows in her attitude/confidence), who after a shoot-out gone bad puts her in a hotspot with the DA, is pretty much forced to get back on the assignment. Through some witty detective work, she finds that Hannibal is currently living in Italy. Meanwhile, an Italian detective realizes who Lector is and goes to getting an award sum for his capture(the money being provided by Lector's ONLY surviving victim, brillantly played by Gary Oldman). <br />What happens next, you'll have to see for yourself.<br />Ridley Scott's direction is beautiful, and there is some jaw-dropping cinematography. The musical score, curtosy of Hans Zimmer, fits the movie perfectly. There is plenty good things about this movie, that haven't been given the proper credit, because of it's comparisons to Silence of the Lambs.<br />The DVD it'self is picture perfect. The extra's are plenty, and there is more than enough trailers to keep you busy. The behind the scenes segments are fun, especially the crowd reaction, and all the celeberties who attended the premiere party. The list of the special features are exactly what they sound like. <br />Overall, Hannibal is an extremely under-rated movie that, unfortunately, falls victim to it's constant comparrisons to Silence of the Lambs. This really isn't fair, because Silence of the Lambs is one of the most important horror films of all time, and Hannibal is not just a horror film, it falls into the many categories of horror, suspence, drama, and even romance. In comparison to Silence of the Lambs, it's really apples and oranges in this case.<br />I give this DVD 4 stars, because of the movie itself. But also the DVD has plenty of extras. Fans of DVD bonuses will not be dissapointed.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic by Harper Lee. The book narrates the story of a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, also called Scout. Lee presented this book through the eyes of Jean Louise. <BR> The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s or so. The plot is about Scouts father, Atticus Finch (a lawyer), trying to defend Black suspect Tom Robinson for accused of raping a White girl in the Maycomb County of Alabama. The plot incorporates several issues that people were struggling during the time of the story, including racism, injustice, and prejudice. The entire novel circulates around Scout and her family. Many situational conflicts arise, from trying to make Boo Radley come out of seclusion to dealing with family and community difficulties. <BR> Lee did a miraculous job of telling the story through the view of Scout. The characters were depicted hardly by their appearances, but by their personality traits, which showed advanced style in writing. The setting and the time periods had a great impact on the story, as people those days lived quite close to each other and knew their neighbors well. I was amazed how natural and realistic the characters were made. Scout and her older brother, Jeremy (also called Jem), reacted to situations exactly as many of the children now days would act. Almost every character in the story had a crucial role at some point of the story. The character development was beyond imagination. From Dill (Jem and Scouts best friend) coming to visit the Finch family in the summer, to Jem trying to make it past the Radleys gate, to Calpurnia (the house cook) scolding the children for not coming home, this piece of literature truly elaborated on pivotal character details. After reading this book, one would think he knows the characters quite well. <BR> Overall, this was a fantastic novel to read and I was truly impressed with the quality of writing and development presented in this story by Harper Lee. To Kill a Mockingbird will truly be an American Literature classic for as long as it will be remembered.
B00003CY0V|2.0|Directed by the master of flash-trash, Dominic Sena (GONE IN 60 SECONDS), the John Travolta action vechicle SWORDFISH is basically a sometimes impressive yet superficial cyber-thriller, done in the predictable Matrix-style action (Are there actually any recent action films out there that don't have the \\"flo-mo\\" gimmick?). Halle Berry gets her kit off, ho hum, semi-impressive action, yeah, yeah. Apart from a really awesome opener with big explosions, the rest has a \\"been there, done that\\" feel about it. It works well if you just want a dumb action flick, but it dosn't provide much more than expensive bangs and \\"cool\\" one-liners.<br />The DVD extras include feature-Length Commentaries, 2 Behind-the-Scenes Documentaries: The Making of \\"Swordfish\\" and The Effects in Focus, 2 Alternate Endings, Hidden Features and trailers. Good extras, but it dosn't cover the fact that the film itself is very sub-par. More discerning veiwers would be best to rent an old copy of Bullit.

B00005R87Q|3.0|Lifting the plot directly from Point Break, The Fast and the Furious is a silly testosterone-fuelled action ride with hot chicks, outrageous stunts, loud cars, and an equally loud soundtrack. Director Rob Cohen seems to be playing it safe relying on the sure-fire formula of said girls and cars after the critically-mauled The Skulls (2000). And the film indeed does work well with all the elements that make a no-brainer movie like this a winner with audiences. Vin Deisel makes a stand-out performance as the main man of the late-night drag racing with NOS-fuelled hot rods, and Michelle Rodriguez provides enough eye candy for all the pre-pubescent boys. The story, as it is, is basically the same as Point Break, with Paul Walker as an undercover cop attempting to infilltrate the late-night speeders, then joining theit unique culture. The sub-plot involving gangsters feels like it's been tagged on to create more of a plot. And watching it from an objectional standpoint, this isn't very impressive or original. But Rob Cohen knows what brainless audiences want in an action flick like this, and in that caveat, it suceeds admirably. Turn up the volume, set your brain to half-mode and this is a winner.<br />The DVD extras include a commentary from director Cohen, &quot;The Making of The Fast and the Furious&quot;, trailers, deleted scenes with optional director commentary, a visual effects montage, Exclusive featurette on editing for the MPAA, Interactive eight camera angle stunt sequence, Movie Magic interactive special effects, Storyboards to final feature comparison, Music Videos (from Ja Rule, caddillac, Tah and Faith Evans) and DVD ROM features.

Parachutes, is so full of emotion, I couldn't find any combination of words that could truly describe the chords that this CD strikes. It just leaves me in awe everytime I listen to it.<br />Lyrically and vocally, they're the kind of tunes that you would/could send to someone special just to let them know what your feeling. Musically it drives home hard with combinations of acoustical ballads fused with arse kickin electric guitar riffs, and backed by emphatic beats.<br />Every aspect of this CD is so unique, from the intensely stirring vocals of Chris Martin, to the magnificent arrangements, and the lyrics are perfectly delicious Mmmm! I think we've all felt what these songs express, but could never find the right words. So one can only say that Coldplay's Parachutes is musical brilliance at it's very best!

0316666343|5.0|I found this book very different then most of the storylines I have ever read and I enjoyed the difference.  I thought it was well done, the characters very real and the author had a way of putting the reader into the story, especially if you had suffered such a tragedy or knew someone who did in your life.  Whoever said there was no closure certainly did not fully comprehend what the writer was conveying.  I think that anyone who has a real compassionate nature and wants to read something that moves you will love this book.  I highly recommend it.
B000063UR2|5.0|Absolutely astounding. Directors cut MUCH closer to origional script. Looks incredible a must have for the fantasy fan!
0316666343|2.0|What am I missing? Why such great reviews? I stopped reading it about 50 pages from the end - forcing myself to try to finish it. I gave up. So disappointing! It just didn't go anywhere. The characters weren't interesting enough. There are too many other good books out there to waste my time on this one.
B00003CXDD|5.0|i love this movie. i can watch it over and over without ever getting sick of it. it looks great on DVD. The storyline and special effects are interesting. Val Kilmer was very funny as Madmartigan. The parts of Willow, Sorsha, Bavmorda, and many others were played extremely well too. i recommend this movie for anyone. you will definitely enjoy it, even if you are not a big fan of fantasy.
0060989157|5.0|I don't know why I bought this book. I bought it like I buy so many other books, on compulsion. I allowed it into the house for a couple of days all-the-while thinking to myself - why? I'm not a Motley Crue fan. Except, perhaps, for a brief flirtation with them via the Shout At The Devil recording back when I was in high school.<br />After reading this book, however, I feel like I've had to reevaluate my relationship with the band; I've become a reluctant Motley Crue fan. I could not put The Dirt down and down I went. The arrangement of the book is well done in that it does not follow the insipid \\"what I did over my summer vacation\\" format. It is linear, but not strictly. The quality of articulation varies from band member to band member. I found Tommy's the most difficult to read because of his excessive use of \\"dude\\" & etc.<br />I especially found myself sympathizing with some of the band members, in particular: Nikki Sixx and Mick Mars, but more on a personal level. All the members of the band, however, have gone through their share of adverse times and at the very least deserve empathy. Despite the numerous tales of wretched revelry (which, really made me gag and, oddly enough, smile at the same time) I never once felt like any one of these guys were pretentiously glorifying their escapades and abuses. I agree with one of the reviewers for this book, that there was a remarkable sense of honesty in all accounts. Motley Crue approached the subject of their lives with a good balance between self-depreciation, equanimity, and humor. The business and social aspects of rock and roll are absurd and deranged (especially at the stratospheric level of fame they achieved) and for these guys to have made it out seemingly alive and more wise is inspirational. The book manages to express this very well.<br />If you're a fan of rock & roll, then I highly recommend this book.
B000002J27|5.0|This is one of the greatest musical works ever, fully comparable to Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, Led Zeppelin's STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN or Elton John's GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD.<br />Fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS will readily perceive the fantasy literature aspect of this music.  The orchestral force of the instuments somehow create a dreamy, surreal atmosphere that is the hallmark of the best fantasy literature.  One is transported into another world where elves, magic and wonder are everywhere.  If you believe in magic and fairies and you love music, this album is a must.
B00005LMBK|1.0|A week ago I came across a new drink called Pepsi Blue.It was cola mixed with berry flavor.This drink kind of caught me by surprise.So I decided to drink some.The first sip,I thought to myself,\\"Wow,I could drink this stuff forever\\".But after finishing about half of the bottle,I had to throw it away,because I thought that it tasted just plain horrible.<br />Pepsi Blue reminds me alot about the Gorillaz.Gorillaz mixed rap with techno,two things that seem like they would go great together,but just seem to be awful,just like Pepsi Blue did with cola and berry flavor.Both Pepsi Blue and Gorillaz hide behind a cool image to make you forget how teribble both of them are.Pepsi Blue hides behind its logo and everything while Gorillaz feature a bunch of animation and animated effects.Both Pepsi Blue and Gorillaz are both marketed products in an attempt to make money.<br />What else do Pepsi Blue and Gorillaz have in common,besides the fact that they are both terrible.Maybe its the fact that if we stop buying both of them,they will both go away.So that is what we should all do to avoid these kinds of things.<br />Peace Out.
B000003TAR|5.0|The greatest band since Led Zepplin. They simply changes the game. This album is amazing. If you have Nevermind, and loved but wanted something harder, buy this one, and Nirvana will completely seduce you. From the rage in Milk It to the hidden message in Rape Me to the quiet but addictive Dumb to the catchy Heart-Shaped Box to one of the best Nirvana songs in Pennyroyal Tea. Another must have, and of course, another Nirvana Album.
B00006AG5N|5.0|When Elvis Presley recorded Hound Dog in 1956, the sound of his voice, along with D.J. Fontanas' machine gun sound on his drum was so fresh that it caught the scene with the young generation, and usher in a new form of music at the time, which was called Rock 'N' Roll. ELV1S 30 # 1 really recaptures that freshness from all of its thirty tracks. The CD captures the richness of Elvis' voice so well, that I am able to hear the tracks through my PC, which has real staticy Speakers, and that causes some of my other cd's vocals to be drowned by the accompiment, which is not the case with this CD. The Ending in Burning Love is a refreshing hunka surprise, and I love the sound on Way Down, with the distorted Guitars, and Suspicous Minds and Love Me Tender among others are just refreshing to listen to. <BR>This is a great CD for traditional and New Fans, and the sound quality is so great that I hope will usher in not just better sound quality for Elvis' work, but all music legends such as Hendrix, and Chuck Berry, and also legends to come. If this CD is any indication, looks like the King of Rock &quot;n&quot; Roll, and the works of other music groundbreakers will get that deserving Royal Treatment of great sound.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is simply amazing. Each song is great in its own way...If you like rock n roll or want to hear rock n roll for the first time, buy this album. I must admit, I was brought into the Nirvana world through Smells Like Teen Spirit, but the band was simply amazing. They were all talented, and so in sync with each other. Dave Grohl is one of the best drummers I've seen in a long while, Krist's bass made the band sound amazing subtly in the backround, and Kurt's screaming and chords made some of the most appealing songs ever. Even now, with \\"You Know You're Right\\" people can not get enough of Nirvana. YKYR is climbing on top of the charts with the same Nirvana appeal it had in 91. This album is amazing...<br />Smells Like Teen Spirit - Annoyingly catching. Not my favorite Nirvana song at all, but this song is amazing, and it took a genius to come up with a song like this at the right time. Kurt knew how to draw the kiddies to his stuff. Grade: A<br />In Bloom - About a lot of Nirvana fans, who simply don't understand but sing along. Addictive verse chords and a hardcore solo makes this song stand out. Grade: A<br />Come As You Are - A classic, without a doubt. A lot of people recognize this song over Smells Like Teen Spirit, and with reason. A mellow song that pulls you in as soon as it starts. Grade: A+<br />Breed - One of those mosh pit songs that make you want to jump up and down. Nice work Kurt. Grade: A-<br />Lithium - Maybe my favorite Nirvana song among all the favorite. Dangerously catchy, and lyrics go so deep you have to pay close attention to understand it all. The confusion, and Kurt playing around with the chords. Masterpiece. Grade: A+<br />Polly - A song anyone would pay attention to. Kurt's singing about rape in this one, and how disgusting it is. So simple, yet so amazing. Grade: A<br />Territorial Pissings - Took me a bit to really get into this song. This is where Kurt just goes nuts, and I wouldn't be surprised if he collapsed at the end of it. Krist does a nice little skit in the beginning too. Grade: A<br />Drain You - A happy song. This song is simple, but the movement, the chemistry, it's all shown here. The little intermission is nice, and when they break back into the song, you're just waiting for Kurt to sing just so you can sing with him. Grade: A+<br />Lounge Act - This song starts off with something that just hurls you into the song. The bass line. This is one of my favorite bass lines, so much that I had to learn it on my guitar. Kurt gets crazy at the end of this song, but stays in rhythm. Grade: A<br />Stay Away - This is an anarchy song, where Kurt again lets it all hang out. He lets out some of his opinions in this, which I'm sure most of you anarchists will like and everyone else will think about. Grade: A-<br />On A Plain - Another happy song, talks a bit about Kurt's dad and just some more of his views. Very deep, with a soft parts around the end where you will go pitch silent for. Grade: A+<br />Something In The Way - What a way to end it! Of course, besides for the few of you that might have heard Endless, Nameless, which is great in its own sense. Kurt talks about the Bridge where the Muddy Banks of Wishkah are, which is the name of their 96 album. Very deep, very eery, very nice. Grade: A-<br />You must purchase this album. This album completely changed rock, and it's not even my favorite Nirvana album! Nirvana was one of the greatest bands of all time, and now, 8 years after their death, they're still attaining new fans everyday, some way, somehow. Make sure there is nothing in the way of you owning this true masterpiece.
B000001E3L|5.0|Wow.  What can you say -- Van and his colleagues put on a clinic that night in San Francisco.  The back cover of this disc superimposes the words &quot;ballads&quot;, &quot;blues&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;, and &quot;funk &amp; jazz&quot; over the track listing, and it's all there in the music.  In the hands of less talented musicians, this could easily have been a recipe for a muddled, incoherent mess; Van and company, however, produce a seamless, flowing performance that fuses all these elements without losing their individual integrity.  As another reviewer commented, this may not be a disc for the casual listener, since it may take repeated listenings and some familiarity with the blues and jazz standards that are referenced here in order to appreciate the virtuosity of their fusion.  What will be clear from the outset, though, is that this concert was no &quot;autopilot off-night&quot; for Van; nor, in fact, was it merely a showcase of the (impressive) collection of guest talent present that night.  Instead, it's an homage to, and celebration of, Van's roots in blues and jazz, and it's every bit as vital and heartfelt as Van's other live discs.
B000002NFM|2.0|There are some times I really don't understand why people like what they do. According to a Q poll published in 1998, this is a more loved album than Dark Side Of The Moon or Abbey Road. I don't really hear anything all that interesting or exciting here. People seem to be hearing genius. I listen to The Fat Of The Land and I hear monotonous drivel, that neither goes anywhere, nor has even half the amount of musical ideas you'd hope for from a fifty minute album. Songs go on and on, and I don't think that anyone who's not a huge fan of this sort of techno is going to like this much.<br />Not everything on The Fat Of The Land is bad, though. \\"Breathe,\\" easily the best track, succeeds in making a groovy, danceable atmosphere with the constant rhythm actually working well and not growing tiresome for a whole four minutes. It's also surprising to find that, while \\"Narayan\\" does repeat itself way too much in places, it is far from as bad as you'd expect as a nine-minute tune from an album like this. Parts of it are actually really good. The ending, though repetitive, does manage to still hold interest. The intro to \\"Mindfields\\" is good, although the song eventually blows itself to hell after that by slipping back into the same thing we've heard over and over here.<br />But the rest... yuck. \\"Funky Sh*t\\" has nothing going for it at all, the predictable beats backed by the line \\"That's some funky sh*t!\\" repeated over and over throughout the song. Not what I want to hear. And the rapping on \\"Disel Power\\" is atrocious, some of the worst I've ever heard, and I'm not even going to mention the awful lyircs. \\"Firestarter\\" is (and I never thought I'd say this) too British for its own good, some worthless rants with an accent that really doesn't fit the music at all, and rather it seems to be the emphasis of the vocal delivery. What a joke. The attempt at aggression in \\"Fuel My Fire\\" falls flat on its face, turning out no more than laughable.<br />God knows why this was (and stillis) so big. Most of it just sounds like generic techno, nothing groundbreaking, innovative or even interesting. It all sounds the same to me, repeated over and over until, *yawn*, is it over yet? Finally. If it weren't for \\"Breathe,\\" I would gladly give this album one star.
B000001FS6|5.0|I admit to being quite surprised by how much I enjoy this particular album---given that my first acquaintance with &quot;Rattle and Hum&quot; was through the associated feature-length video.  The version here of &quot;van Dieman's Land&quot; (Track 2) is particularly excellent, and notable in its exceptional haunting quality.  This is certainly was a valuable addition to my, or any, U2 collection.
B0000256VK|4.0|This feels autumnal, which is why I found it dull when I first heard it - there's none of the raw excitement of the early Roxy. Instead the music is soft and atmospheric, with Ferry's synthlines sketching out a moody soundscape of a rare elegance. One of the most gorgeous albums you'll ever hear, with Ferry sounding warmer and more genuinely soulful than he ever has before (or since). This enormously influential album pointed the direction for many of Roxy's '80s proteges, showing the haunting textures and gorgeous melodies that synth-pop could create. &quot;More Than This,&quot; &quot;To Turn You On,&quot; &quot;Take A Chance With Me,&quot; the title track, etc., are sweeter and more emotionally vulnerable (and believable) than their previous work, and Ferry's singing is at his peak. Manzanera and Mackay play an understated, subtle role, rarely adding more than a few spare lines to counterpoint Ferry's synths.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Yes, this movie was very different..  The beginning is almost mind blowing.  However, it is a lovely, and sensitive story.  The voices of Ewan Mcgregor and Nicole Kiddman are fantastic.  I enjoyed it very much and came away singing... \\"The greatest thing you'll every learn is just to love and be loved in return.\\"  Buz Lurhmann created a fabulous background for the movie which portrayed an earlier time while using more updated music...    I loved it!...  Those who didn't probably would like a less sensitive movie - perhaps more chase scenes, action, and killing...   Thanks for a change of pace.
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden's 1980 debut album has certainly stood the test of time well. Still earthy and gritty, Iron Maiden is a great offering of NWOBHM class, a touch of streetwise punk and moody side tangents. The variety and skill the band showed at such an early age is quite impressive and as a result, their first album is a classic that still deserves praise and attention.<br />The band's later inclination towards epic arrangements is still in early bloom here, as &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; shows. The seven minute song is the band's first epic track and shows a good sense of ambitious arrangement as well as the twin lead guitar attack the band would ultimately be infamous for. But the album also offers a lot of dirtier and harder rocking songs like the opening &quot;Prowler&quot; and &quot;Running Free&quot;. And as a very interesting counterpart to the epics and rocking tracks, &quot;Strange World&quot; and &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; are both hypnotic and geniunely introspective mellow pieces that prove the band could quiet things down to create a very strong pensive mood. Original lead vocalist Paul Di'anno offers a fabulous gritty voice to the material. His voice is what originally lent Iron Maiden a street level credibility that other, higher octave bands might not have gotten in 1980.<br />Even when compared to their awesome later releases, the debut from Maiden still holds a place as a remarkable album in my collection.
B00000DCH9|5.0|PIANO MAN was Billy Joel's debut album on Columbia Records, released in October 1973.  After the fiasco of his 1971 solo LP, COLD SPRING HARBOR, Billy demanded out of his contract from Family Productions and manager Artie Ripp.  Billy headed out to L.A. in order to \\"hide\\" from Ripp, and took a job as a piano player at the Executive Lounge.  If Mr. Ripp had no idea where Billy Joel was, the people from Columbia Records sure the hell did.  They took first took notice of Billy's excellent stage show after his '72 tour, and then came down to see him at the Executive.  Eventually, Columbia signed him to a record deal. <BR>All these events were the inspiration for Billy's first Columbia classic, PIANO MAN, a staple of classic rock radio. All the people in the lyrics such as Davy in the navy, John at the bar, etc. were real people who he had known from the piano bar gig.  There are other songs on the album that were autobiographical or true stories (although not necessarily about the LA gig):<BR>CAPTAIN JACK was about Long Island suburban teenager life; BALLAD OF BILLY THE KID was about another Billy from Oyster Bay; YOU'RE MY HOME was a Valentine song for his first wife, etc. Ultimately, this album amounted to a collection of brilliantly-written epic compositions with excellent playing and arrangements.  ...The critics gave generally positive reviews to the album, although it was not a great seller as TURNSTILES, THE STRANGER or 52nd STREET. However, this is an astonishing debut, and in my opinion, one of the best in rock n roll.
B000002UTH|2.0|Somehow, the Peppers' collaboration with George Clinton has found a status as a sort of overlooked 'cult classic', but man, I just can't see why it's so loved. I guess you could say that it's the closest the band ever got to doing a pure funk album, since most of the band's efforts have more than enough trace of rock in them, with horns in the background and Flea's bass playing in perhaps its most prominent role ever. It's not even that I don't like this style either, but there should at least be a good amount of entertainment and groove power to it, and most of these tracks are just so by the numbers and as far from exciting as possible, plus there's the added annoyance of the band cramming in even more stupid filler than any of their other 80's albums (especially those pointless short tracks near the end), which is quite an accomplishment.<br />There's maybe only one truly awful song in the title track, an awfully simplistic and boring groove that just seems to repeat itself forever and ever with that 'screw em just to see the look on their face' line, but still, the opening two tracks (\\"Jungle Man\\" and \\"Hollywood\\") come out totally flat and unconvincing, particularly the latter's generic 'party' vibe and plodding tempo, the closing \\"Yertle The Turtle\\" has annoying spoken bits to go along with pretty much no melody or excitement (though at least \\"The Brother's Cup\\", dumb as it is, has some entertaining moments within). Oh, and there's also a whole bunch of absolutely useless brief filler tracks that serve no purpose except for being idiotic jokes and space fillers (particularly the inane \\"Sex Rap\\" and the directionless \\"Battle Ship\\"). <br />The saving grace of this album, though, are the two fairly excellent highlights. The band didn't actually write \\"If You Want Me To Stay\\" and that phenomenally groovy bassline and vocal melody it has (credit that to Sly and the Family Stone), but it nonetheless possesses such a tight, incredible amount of presence that it's easily the best on the album. The other somewhat impressive song is the hilariously stupid \\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\", whose fast tempo, lyrics and chanting are so incredibly over the top and ridiculous that I can never resist it at all. Too bad it's so short at less than 2 minutes. But regardless of those, do not buy this album, since these two gems can be found on What Hits?!.
6304493681|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie!  The action was top notch, the story line was great, and the animation and art was AWSOME!!  The movie, &quot;ghost in the shell&quot; is about a program named 2501 or the &quot;Puppet Master&quot; that gets off on its own and forms its own idenitdy, and section 9 trying to stop it from getting away.  I gave this movie a 4 because the movie is rather short and the superly dupper challenge to understand what the *uck the conversation between some people is about.
0783211856|5.0|My last book was Pat Conroy's \\"Beach Music\\".  That work finds another angle to show the insanity of the Holocaust (the despised yet pitiful \\"Judenrat\\", mildly covered in this film) when one might have thought there was nothing more new to cover.  Coincidently this weekend I caught this movie, so at this point I'm pretty sober about the misery humans are capable of inflicting upon one another.  <br />The major plot, of course, involves the amazing feat of saving approximately 1,000 Jews from death by the unlikliest of sources:  the Catholic, womanizing, profiteering businessman Oscar Schindler.  The movie indeed does hint that profit may have been the original motive in using cheap labor to finally be a \\"success\\" in business.  But there is no doubt that genuine human feelings were involved when his entire fortune is used to pull one of history's great con jobs on one of history's most ruthless regimes (sadly, there were others just as bad).<br />We also not only see the ghastly and heartbreaking scenes of physical depravity, but the movie goes even further.  Not only was this a plan by Germany to kill people, it was a campaign to humiliate and degrade them every step of the way to their deaths.  Through murder, intimidation, and propaganda, a band of thugs took over a nation with what seems to be goal of wiping out an entire race of people.  <br />So while we see the scenes in the camps, an angle I'm going to take in this review is the, and I hate to say it, brilliant efficiency of how it was carried out.  Before WWII ever started, there were years of grooming of the German people for this task.  Imagine you had lived at this time, with very few media outlets, and you were bombarded for years with newspaper and radio articles about the \\"atrocities\\" Jews committed.  This tactic really softened up the country for what was to come.  <br />We see how propaganda decends to public humiliation.  Then slowly laws are passed taking away more and more rights of these people (remember also that gypsies, the handicapped and homosexuals got this treatment, also).  Then comes the order that all Jews were to be isolated in very small areas and how they were to survive there was up to them.  This is roughly where the movies opens.  <br />The next move was the charade of the \\"labor\\" camps.  These facilities were merely fronts to weed out the weak, who were the most defenseless, and the least likely to cause a stink if missing. It was merely a tactic to do \\"research and development\\" on ways to mass dispose of humans.  It is from the ghettos and these camps that Schindler gets his first \\"skilled workers\\".  <br />The final depths are shown when the Nazis flat out drop the charade of \\"work\\" camps, and flat out start sending them to death camps.  The comparateley minor victory of Mr. Schindler saving a few humans is achieved here, but it is also where Speilberg clearly shows the \\"business\\" of mass murder.  When some of his people are diverted to a death camp, we are taken through the procedure.  The \\"product\\" comes in via a well-designed rail system.  They are divided into product categories, where \\"salvage\\" in the form of hair and clothes are removed for the war effort.  Before recieving the humiliating camp clothing, the product is \\"decontaminated\\" via a shower.  This shower may contain water or poison gas, depending on the capacity to process the finished product.  The central effect is a huge smokestack, ghostly lit at night.  Billowing 24 hours a day.  Looks like any other factory smokestack, but when you realize what the smoke is, you it's flat out frightening.  <br />The movie is not for the faint of heart, but anyone seeing it should emerge a better person for it.
B000060P79|2.0|This CD is good but only for the pop-punk fans. I've listened to 1000's of bands just like Simple Plan that the pop-punk fans probly dont know about. You people writing reviews thinking NFG is real punk, need to pick up some Sex Pistols, Ramones, Black Flag, and Anti-Flag. If you really like Anti-Flag and their lyrics, then maybe you might like actual punk. This band is ok but there are THOUSANDS of bands just like them that you know-nothings have never heard of. Most people that listen to these big bands that use to be good before they sold out like Blink are probably ignorant preps or jocks. I knew Blink and liked them since Chershire Cat. I never woulda thought they'd turn out like they are now. If you want another same-old pop-punk band than buy this. have fun. haha.
B00004Z459|5.0|this is linkin park's first and best cd because all of the songs on the cd are awesome like my favorites &quot;points of authority&quot;,&quot;by myself&quot; and &quot;forgotten&quot; and you got the radio played songs, &quot;crawling&quot; and&quot; in the end&quot;.all around a excellent cd go pick it up if you like rock music.
0743442539|5.0|The two cardinal rules of criticism are: 1) A critic must distinguish what he likes or dislikes personally for subjective reasons and what is objectively good or bad, and 2) a critic must judge works on their own terms. <br />\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is a spy novel, a story about espionage. It is not concerned with evil-genius super-crooks and science-fiction gadgetry; it is not a cops-and-robbers concoction. You may prefer super-crooks, etc., but as far as your review is concerned, that is neither here nor there.<br />\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is hard-boiled fiction. You may prefer Agatha Christie to Dashiell Hammett, Fitzgerald to Hemingway; you may prefer \\"colorful\\" characters and settings, but that's you.<br />\\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is not and does not purport to be \\"realistic\\". It is genre-fiction (not \\"literature\\") just realistic enough to draw you into its web. (In his introduction to \\"The Looking-Glass War\\", the author himself makes this point clearly and, one might say, vehemently.) \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is plot-driven, not character-driven. Essentially, in fact, it's a small puzzle for you to work out. (The solution is given.) Only readers who enjoy working out puzzles, readers who like to think, need apply.<br />With the possible exception of \\"The Russia House\\" (which I also heartily recommend), \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" is John Le Carre's best spy novel (he has also published detective stories and non-genre fiction), and the best he is likely ever to write. (Ian Fleming's James Bond short stories, by the way, are much better than his James Bond novels, and I recommend these -- the short stories -- too.)
B000008HPE|4.0|Huey Lewis & the News hit the mainstream after the success of the blockbuster album \\"Sports\\" from 1983.  While riding high from the album's 10 million copies sold and five hit singles (four were Top Ten hits and one was a Top Twenty hit), the band contributed two songs for the film \\"Back To the Future.\\"  Like \\"Sports,\\" the film was a blockbuster and the News scored their first #1 hit with \\"The Power of Love.\\"  Following up two HUGE successes (actually three if you include their contributions to \\"USA For Africa\\"), the News went back into the studio.  The album that they made was \\"Fore!\\" and it best described the attitude the band took to their success.  The album was another big hit for them scoring four Top Ten hits, including \\"Stuck With You\\" and \\"Jacobs Ladder\\" which both were #1 hits. This album would turn out to be the height of their success.  I highly recommend this album to anyone wanting to sit down and have a damn good time listening to fun music.  Although \\"Fore!\\" is not a great album like \\"Sports,\\" it is a worthy followup. RECOMMENDED!
B00005JKLZ|3.0|There is a number of things that you would question in the movie, surely the use of computer graphics to spruce up the picture which did lead a more dazzeling film, but to use the title 'The Time Machine', that of HG Wells original book is rather more an insult for that it does not hardly follow the original ideas of the novel.<br />I enjoyed parts of this film, a good soundtrack also complimented to the mood, but a weak plot, a poor beggining and even a poor ending of the film had spoilt it in effect from start to finish,,,,,,,, a man who can read minds was not able read the words that would lead to his death.<br />The film is in no way a comparison to the novel, it does not show the meaning of that what was intended through the novel, it is a average film that would please most of the audience until somthing new comes out, it surely is no masterpeice.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a fast growing favorite among the teenage group. She got her way to the top without sexuality and anything unusual, and that it what makes me admire her. She plays alot of instruments, and unlike many female pop singers today, she actually has some talent.<br />When I first heard \\"Complicated\\" i thought she would be a one hit wonder, but as \\"Sk8er Boi\\" came along, I knew she was here to stay. I immediatly went out a purchased the CD. After listening to every track, I realised that not only can she sing one type of song, but many different. She can make her voice quick and rocky in \\"Sk8er Boi\\" yet soft, and touchy in \\"I'm With You.\\" <br />I recommend this to all age groups. Although I am not a big fan of teen pop singers, Avril Lavigne's music really caught my eye. Amongst the whole CD, my two favorites are \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Sk8er Boi\\" Have fun purchasing and listening to this mix of music!
0571212689|5.0|I took Williams' masterclass many years ago, and this book is an excellent distillation of everything he taught in that class, and then some.  While I think he almost spends TOO much time on walk cycles and not quite enough on accents and weight, this book covers all the bases quite well.  It bridges the gap between Preston Blair's book, which is primarily step-by-step, and _The Illusion of Life_, which is primarily theory.
0316666343|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It was so insightful and artfully written.  I loved how Sebold not only focused on Susie's death, but how her death affected friends, family and mere aquaintances for years afterward.  This book was simply amazing!
0316666343|3.0|It's a good read and it's written in an ethereal style that's very compelling, but there's a plot point near the end of the book that drags the narrative into mawkish \\"Touched by an Angel\\" territory.  I'd like to read more from her, though.
0440213525|5.0|This is another of Grishams masterpieces.  He showed his extradinary talent in the creation of this tragic thriller.
B00005OAIE|5.0|...  Mayer is in a class by himself and I don't find him to be copying anyone. This is unique stuff, guys. I think it's obvious to most of us out there!  Beautiful soulful dripping voice, great guitar and smart lyrics coming from this very young artist. Yes, he's in that general folky area  of the wonderful David Grey (buy White Ladder!), DMB and Jeff Buckley, but Mayer is in his own unique space. \\"Not myself\\" is my favourite... buy this cd and I don't think you will be disappointed!
0440211727|4.0|John Grisham has created yet another masterpiece with this thrilling story of a family destroyed by a rape.  This was an excellent example of his writing skills.
6304057709|5.0|This film is lovely in clothes, scenes, and characters.  Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are just absolutely wonderful in their so carefully understated roles.  I liked their characters so much that I wished they were getting married instead of...opps, don't want to spoil it for anyone.  This film ranks in my top 10 favorites.  Just a joy &amp; and gem!
B00004RFFI|4.0|Jo (Helen Hunt) and Bill (Bill Paxton) are fed up and want a divorce. But wait, there's Dorothy. The machine that contains many sensors that can measure how a tornado is formed. There's a catch, you'd have to be insane to drive up to the tornado to release the machine to be sucked up. The two join forces along with the rest of the team and Bill's new fiancee (played by Jami Gertz). Stuff gets ravaged, cows fly and cars blow up. Yes. You need to see the 500 pound cow run at the beginning of the movie to the bomb shelter. It's hilarious. See Jo's father fly away to evaporation! Jonas (Cary Elwes) is a corporate sponsored storm chaser and he gets what he deserves because he's a sonofa. Does anybody really like \\"The Shining,\\" tornados don't. Pure havoc in a movie. A good disaster film.
B0000509C3|3.0|Children of the Corn isn't a bad movie, but it is certainly not very scary.  When I was young and this movie was new, my conception of the movie was wrapped in an aura of fright, but now that I have finally watched it, I don't know where that aura came from.  The theme of the movie is nothing new, really, but it has real potential by its very nature.  In Gatlin, Nebraska, there are virtually no adults; the children, led by the young and powerful Isaac with the help of head goon Malachai, murdered all of the adults in the name of religious mania.  He Who Walks Behind the Rows made himself known to Isaac, and that is where all the trouble started three years earlier.  Only two children are not active participants in the twisted religion of Gatlin children-Job and Sarah.  Sara has the \\"gift of sight,\\" oftentimes revealing future events in her crayon drawings.  Now two strangers have come to town, having run over an already murdered youngster who had tried to escape through the corn fields.  The fate of adults in town is not really a deep secret, but our heroes stumble around idiotically, wising up only when the children have made their move.<br />John Franklin gives an impressive performance as the young prophet Isaac, adding a real sense of realism this movie had to have in order to work.  Courtney Gains plays his character Malachai very well, but unfortunately the \\"farm implement of death\\"-happy Malachai is one of the most annoying characters in the history of moviemaking.  Our unsuspecting adult \\"interlopers\\" are OK but not outstanding; Peter Horton gives a credible yet unspectacular performance, and a pre-Terminator Linda Hamilton serves the necessary function of generating sympathy for the grown-ups.  The children Job and Sarah are likeable, but the fact that Job serves as the film's de facto narrator gives a part of the story away fairly early on.<br />One is left with any number of questions after viewing the film.  Since the murder of the town's adults took place three years prior to the arrival of the interlopers, why do even the youngest kids look exactly the same?  Why do some seem too old to be children to start with?  Who plants all this corn, anyway, and why wouldn't the ill-fated runaway choose to escape during winter, when the corn would presumably be much easier to navigate?  Why are the two adults so slow-witted?  The movie begs many more questions than it answers.  One is also hard pressed to figure out what exactly He Who Walks Behind the Rows really is.  The special effects witnessed at the concluding moments of the movie are unspectacular and unilluminating, and the conclusion does little more than simply bring the movie to a close.  The adults' reactions to events are often inconsistent and seemingly peculiar, at times making the plot sound as weak as it sometimes is.  I won't blame Stephen King for the faults of this film adaptation of his work, particularly given the fact that it takes great liberty with his original short story.  This isn't a movie to avoid, but it basically serves as a diversion rather than a gripping horror story to the would-be viewer.place three years prior to the arrival of the interlopers, why do even the youngest kids look exactly the same?

B00000JLWW|1.0|&quot;Titanic&quot; won so many Academy Awards, but why? Everything about it makes me sick. The direction, script, acting and music! Sirens to my ears! I was disappointed that James Cameron directed this overblown 'epic' about two lovers whose love survived the sinking of the great ship. You know what? It would've been great if Arnold Schwarzenegger was in this because he would've defeated the iceberg. Forget the two hundred year-old woman and her necklace. That's obscenity. An insanely disappointing movie!
B00006G8LB|5.0|This movie was actually very good.And I wasn't expecting it to be.I didn't think they could actually pull it off. It was entertaing from the beginning to the end. Tobey Maguire was the most adorable super hero I've ever seen! You gotta check this movie out if you haven't seen it already.
B00004YW6I|4.0|Late 2000 saw PJ Harvey release this great disc,a mixed bag of soft ballads and hard rockers.One of musics true unsung songwriters,Polly Jean lays out beautiful songs with understated playing and full throttle rockers that are as heavy as anything you`ll hear on the radio.New York City is the backdrop for most of the album,songs about falling and being in love mix with observations of the place she was at at the time...physically and emotionally.A great disc worth checking out.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Yes, this movie has received a lot of criticism for being overly hyped, too cartoony, or too predictable. There is a plain reason for this - it's based on a COMIC BOOK! I think people really need to relax and just enjoy it once in a while, not everything has to be Academy Award-worthy. I do admit that Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin mask was just a bit corny looking, but the awesome special effects pretty much make up for that. I still think he was a great choice for the part, as were Tobey Maguire and James Franco for theirs. Some think it adds too much of a teen factor, having two of the biggest teen stars in the leading roles (Maguire and Kirsten Dunst), but the fact that it was derived from a comic book that has been read by many people more than twice their ages helps to weigh out that belief. All in all, it's a great action packed movie that really pulls you into the story, and I for one can't wait for a sequel.
B000067DNC|3.0|Je suis extrêmement déçu de ne pas avoir la trame sonore en français. J'aime bien avoir la version originale anglaise mais la trame sonore francaise aurait été appréciée. Je ne pense d'ailleurs pas conserver le coffret de cette deuxième saison à cause de cela. Pour le prix, par contre, c'était extra. <br />Toutes les saisons de Stargate SG1 devraient par contre figurer à votre collection si vous êtes un vrai fan! Pour ceux qui comme moi ont un appareil multi-région... la version avec trames sonore francaise est disponible en France... mais pas mal plus coûteuse par contre.
0393312836|5.0|The inspiration of a movie that was banned in Europe until just recently, A Clockwork Orange has been a long standing classic of modern literature. Set in a futuristic world where \\"malchicks\\" spend their nights prowling for unsuspecting victims to mutilate and/or torture, the story revolves around a young man named Alex and his \\"droogs\\". The gang of teenagers begins the evening with a milk-plus at the Korova milkbar, followed by a thirst for violence which is satisfied by breaking into houses and beating the inhabitants to near-death while destroying everything tangible, or \\"tolchocking\\" a starry (old) veck (man) or two that they may come across on the dark city streets. But, as is suspected, all is not well in Alex's world. The self-proclaimed leader of his gang, whose faith in him is failing, eventually causes a revolt of sorts. Alex is left, at the scene of one of their crimes, to be caught by the police.<br /> Alex is locked up after being given the usual brutality, and soon is carrying a long sentence with him. After some trouble in the cell which he shares with five other men, Alex is yet again fed to the wolves, so to speak, when he is blamed for the death of an inmate. At this point he is brought forth as a candidate for the experimental \\"Ludovico's Technique,\\" and it is at this point that the motive of the story surfaces. In the battle between good and evil, to what extent should the willingness to do good be imposed upon the members of society? At what cost should the government interfere with it's citizens' urges and desires? In the end, it all comes down to a moral standpoint, and the question of whether a man without free will is really a man at all.
B00006F7S4|1.0|I love Beck. I'd marry him. He's amazingly creative, talented, bizarre, dresses in funny suits, has cool hair, and dances like a crazyperson. I love all of his previous albums and was super-excited about this one.<br />It is awful. AWFUL. I was so shocked by its droning monotony that I thought, and am still suspicious, that is it a joke. Anyone who has heard his previous work must be wondering.<br />Not that I think artists should be restricted from going in new directions with their music, because obviously that is the only direction to go, but JESUS! Every song sounds the same. Seriously. Are we in the Twilight Zone? Did he get a labotomy?<br />This, from the guy who THROWS FRIZBIES AT THE SUN!<br />(beck- I love your music and I hope you come back to us!)
B00004U30D|4.0|This is a brilliant satire on middle America and an exhilarating exploration of what is \\"normal\\" and \\"ordinary\\".  The central character (Spacey) embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery and liberates himself from a pointless marriage, a pointless job, and a pointless lust for a Lolita-type schoolgirl --...The only jarring element here is the parodistic military man next door.  Spacey is superb and the direction is excellent.
B000066NW0|5.0|LET GO is the best C.D. of all time! Ever since I heard Complicated, I knew this would b a good c.d. avril writes all her own songs, and in all different styles! My three favorite songs on this C.d are (although all the songs RULE!): Losing Grip, a song about a guy who doesnt really care about their realationship...real good beat! Things I'll Never Say-Favorite song on the C.D mainly because that really is how you feel when you like someone, and third Complicated-ENOUGH SAID!!!!! Buy this C.D. or YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JL96|5.0|This is quite simply the most imaginative, creative, and fun Disney film in years.  The animation is stunning and beautiful recalling the wonderfully detailed cartoons of 1940' and 50's. Unlike like recent Disney efforts, Lilo and Stitch doesn't just devolve into a series of poorly animated musics videos with all star voices.  This is a classic along the lines of The Iron Giant and the Miyazaki films (Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke).  The opening sequence featuring Stitch's escape in an absolutely hilarious masterpiece of animation.   Enjoyable for adults and children with a positive message that isn't forced or overly sentimental.  Far and away more impressive on any level than other highly touted Disney epics like the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast!  One of the finest films of 2002.  A must see!
B000068CNX|5.0|Friends is the best television show ever. The chemistry of the group is absolutely phenomenal. You'll love every single second of the show. It's so popular because subconciously everyone wants to have that kind of life. Buy this awesome DVD
0441009425|5.0|I just finished reading this (I read the last 200 pages in one sitting) and I loved it!  I noticed several people have complained about the ending... well, pooh on them.  I enjoyed it, thought the plot was amazing, good character development and a wonderful mystery to unravel.<br />I simply cannot wait for Mr. Reynolds' next work!
B0000542D2|2.0|The movie is still great and this is worth having for that alone.  There is no need for discussion on that.  The restored audio leaves a little to be desired, but bits of dialog I had wondered about for 38 years are now easier to decipher. The musical dynamics are piss poor.<br />Meanwhile, the big disgrace is the lack of new information in the bonus portions.  Originally expected to contain 8 hours of outtakes and the deleted \\"You Can't Do That\\", we are treated to endless interviews by people whose 15 minutes of fame expired all those years ago.  There is even an intro to a deleted scene (John Lennon on the stairway with the dancer)... minus the scene.  It's just a shame and a sham that Miramax... er, the Mouse, has such low regard for cultural history, the opportunity to expand upon it and the interest of the public that buys their product.<br />Finally, disc 1 doesn't even load in my computer (it plays fine in my DVD player) and their help line is useless.  Double check your copy before the opportunity to exchange it expires.
B00005YUNY|3.0|The picture, sound and performances in this concert are phenomenal, with Jon Anderson in particular being captured here in excellent voice. I would have given this very good concert disk 6 stars if only the... the... PERSON who mixed this sound had turned Steve Howe up in the mix!! In many places he is virtually inaudible when playing electric guitar. An excellent rendition of \\"The Gates Of Delerium\\" is terribly emasculated. The torrid guitar lines of the original song from the 1974 album \\"Relayer\\" or even the version from the 1980 live album \\"YesShows\\" are replaced here by note-accurate but wimpy-sounding renditions. I know Steve Howe isn't 25 years old anymore and he's now a technically better player, but he now plays too \\"politely\\" in my opinion. ROCK OUT, Steve!! Lighten up, man. we love you, but REALLY!! Don't let the contentment of middle-age weaken your sound and mojo.<br />In short, turning Howe up, up, UP more in the mix would have turned this enjoyable show into something truly magic. Re-mix and re-release it again, PLEASE...
B00005JLD2|5.0|I have already done a review for this on the IMDB so i wont give you a word for word repeat here.I will say that i think this stunningly beautiful movie may be the greatest we have ever made in this country.Trust me if you love wonderful cinematography great acting and an incredible story that will touch your heart you just have to see this movie.I am so kicking myself that i never saw it in the theartre.At the moment it is out as a rental only dvd here in ozz but it is a glorious 2 disc set with fantastic comm from philip noyce and great behind the scenes doco.Luckily i managed to score an ex rental this week and it is one of the jewels in my collection.You guys can buy it from ezydvd in early december but i would recomend you catch on the big screen first.It was interesting to find out that philip noyce dropped out of the sum of all fears to come home and make this movie,man did he make a great choice there!
B000062XFG|4.0|Although I don't like the style of the box too much, and I'd rather have had the box be a more durable material than cardboard, overall a great buy!
B000006YYW|3.0|This album is great to anyone who is a BEE GEES fan. For the most part it has the sound of pre-disco BG's. It's best only for diehard fans although Juliet has a top ten hit in Germany. For the rest of the public it's better to try the group recordings.
1577311523|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I found it very inspiring despite its sometimes obvious conclusions. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a more spiritual and centered path in life.
B00006AFUR|5.0|Totally unique in a world full of carbon copies, 30 Seconds to Mars is a release from the drudgery of the same old same old. Fueled with a passion (and a few messages), their music rips through you, and if it doesn't catch you immediately, check your pulse. Welcome to the Universe.
B00006AG5N|1.0|1 star deduction for another countless reissue of Elvis Presley's compilation.. Also, I have to take another star off for bad remix of Little Less Conversation.. For some reasons, I don't think King of Rock &amp; Roll and Techno go together..<BR>Take another star off if you will, for milking money from People.. Oh Yeah, one last thing, there is no absolutely nothing news from Elvis this time.. Everything have been heard before millions time.. Point off for that too... So there you have it, the only 1 star for this album..
B00006AFUR|5.0|In a world full of carbon copies, 30 SecondsTo Mars is a long awaited breath of fresh air. From Capricorn on, you're taken on a journey upon who's return from, you will be forever changed. Ripe with passion and edge (and messages for those with the inclination), this music rips through who you used to be, and if it doesn't catch you, check your pulse. Welcome to the Universe.
B000065U1N|3.0|This movie delivers a lot of good virtues any  american (& non-American) soldier must have, but I have some observes about the location, there was a somali taxi driver praying \\"Salat Al-Maghreb\\" (Sunset prayer) he was facing the ocean and the sun was there, but how?!!! Somalian coast (in the South where the capital is) faces E/SE so who brought the sun there!!??<br />That will lead Us that it (coast) was facing W/NW, and if watch the movie again we`ll notice the the streets` signs show the word \\"Zanka\\" and that how Moroccan calls \\"Street\\", so according to what I noticed the Location was Morocco (or Maybe Mauritania) not Somalia, so Mr.Director why don't you be frank with us and refer to the location?
B000002UJQ|5.0|You don't listen to \\"OK Computer\\". You experience it, you feel it, for an album of this calibre deserves such fitting words. In a rock world where you're quickly branded with a genre and \\"assigned\\" a fanbase Radiohead seems to be above all that. They're rock, yet they're not, an enigma almost.<br />The album is simply put brilliant, some have even gone as far as comparing it to something Pink Floyd would of done, and rightfully so. \\"OK Computer\\" is undeniably influenced by Pink Floyd, but that in no way means Radiohead actually went ahead and became a clone band. They simply took everything you knew about Rock, tore it apart and reassembled it to create this masterpiece.<br />\\"OK Computer\\" is primarily composed of songs that were meant to be listened to while laying down, to put you inside your mind, case and point \\"Karma Police\\" or \\"The Tourist\\". However, fear not, the band does turn things up a notch for the eighth track \\"Electioneering\\" with some of the most infectious guitar work I've ever heard.<br />Personally, it's albums like these that make music worthwhile and lets you know there are some true musicians out there, in an ever darker music scene consumed by MTV. But, this isn't something everyone will like, not every single rock fan will \\"get\\" this album, and that's okay. Radiohead didn't set out to make an album that would please everyone. I'm pretty sure they didn't intend to make one of the greatest albums ever, but that's just too bad, because without a doubt they succeeded.
6300184064|5.0|great movie. i recomend it very highly. and if u liked this one, then get 12 monkeys also.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I think what makes all of the old Universal horror films so timeless is that at the time they were released, there was nothing else like them. Think about it.<br />When Bela Lugosi donned his cape in Dracula, vampires were still a new concept to American audiences.  What was a werewolf, if not some old European folk tale?  Who had ever pieced dead bodies together and brought them back to life before Frankenstein did it?  Jeepers Creepers introduces a new monster.  One that kills and consumes to regenerate itself.  If we have seen this before, it was just in nibbles and sniffs.  This movie is an eyes-open full-blown look into the face of a new creature in our monster pantheon.<br />Jeepers Creepers was born in the late 1990's, early 2000's, when Wes Craven and his Scream franchise had rejuvinated the killer-with-a-knife formula that was started as far back as Psycho, distilled in the Texas Chainsaw massacre, and refined for the masses in Halloween and Friday the 13th.  The previews for Jeepers Creepers sure give the impression of yet another tale of pouty, posturing teens stalked by a masked avenger with a knife who wants to punish them for their sexual transgressions.<br />In reality, what Jeepers Creepers delivers is a throwback to the days when a monster was a monster and there were things moving in the dark.<br />I just finished watching this film for the fourth time about 10 minutes ago and I realize there are some glaring holes in the story (i.e. how does a monster go to the DMV office and get personailized plates AND somehow get the lettering to be uneven and jumbled in a \\"crazy\\" way?).<br />If you read my other reviews, you will notice I watch a lot of horror films.  If you enjoy horror films also, then there is one thing you probably already know.. do not expect perfect continuity.  If you watch an historical drama, then I guess you expect accuracy and continuity.  In horror films, that isn't the case.  <br />To enjoy a horror film, I expect a few things.  First, take me some place where I am uncomfortable.  Make me question my safety.  Make me feel that no matter what I do, I am going to meet with a gruesome end.<br />Jeepers Creepers introduces us to the \\"Creeper\\", a new addition to the pantheon of classic horror figures.  The entire story takes place during one fateful afternoon/evening, along a country road in (place you favorite southern state name here).  It is hot.  The characters are sweaty and you can almost smell them.  The Creeper certainly can.  <br />The Amazon review tells most of the secrets of the film.  If you are reading this, then what you really want to know is \\"why should I watch this movie?  Well, all I can offer is that it is different.  If you want a good, old fashioned monster flick, then by God you came to the right place.<br />i would give this film 5 stars but there are those nasty plot holes, plus director Victor Salva was busted for \\"certain\\" crimes which I must protest.  I must say that he did a fine job filming this creature feature though.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I will only echo the other positive reviews here and say that this is the best album since REM's Automatic for the People. It takes a couple of listen-throughs, but after that you cannot help but be captivated by the songwriting and craftmanship that went into the music on this album. By turns serious and fun, melodic and hard-rocking, this is the definitive album of the year without a doubt. There can be no doubt that right now Wilco is America's Best Rock and Roll Band.
B00005K9LN|3.0|I've always heard people, for some reason, praising this c.d., and I feel it's time to give my opinionated opinion. It's OVER-RATED! (The c.d.- not my opinion). Don't get me wrong, British Steel has it's good points. Tom Allom does a surprisingly good job with the production. Also, there are some good head-banging riffs. Just listen to \\"Grinder\\", \\"Living After Midnight\\", and \\"Breakin' the you-know-what\\". But after hearing Stained Class and Hell Bent for Leather, British Steel just doesn't compare. It's more like a retrogression. It's evident in the drumming dept. (What ever happened to Les Binks)? And it's definately noticable in the lyrics. (Well, that was noticable in some of Hell Bent). It's a must have for any Priest fan, but choose Screaming, Defenders, Stained Class, or Hell Bent before British Steel. Oh yeah, does \\"United\\" sound like a high school graduation song, or is it just me?
B00006F7S4|5.0|Sitting down to write this, It's hard for me to imagine that almost TEN years ago I was riding in the back of my friend's car (going home from Junior High for god's sake...) jamming out to 'Loser' and 'The Sign' by Ace of Base... A short time after I bought a copy of Mellow Gold, I stumbled on a copy of another Beck release. I thought it'd be another Mellow Gold-esque jam session, but it turned out to be just Beck, an acoustic guitar, and some friends from the Olympia, WA area. There were no psychadelic freak out sounds, no vocoders, nothing... Just the man doin his thing, and sounding sad, thoughtful and mellow. That album was \\"One Foot in the Grave\\", released on K Records in 1993.<BR>   I had the same reaction to \\"One Foot in the Grave\\" as may reviews I've read from fans and newcomers alike: \\"It doesn't sound like New Pollution... I Can't dig it....Too Depressing.\\" And if that's what you're seeking, then you probably should skip this album. If your tastes are limited to what's popular, or what makes you shake your thing, this won't be for you. It wasn't for me at the time: I just filed \\"One Foot\\" in the rack, and never came across it again until a year or so later, when I had just finished listening to Mellow Gold all the way through, and I was deep in thought over \\"Blackhole\\", the last track on the disc. Then I gave \\"One Foot\\" a try. BOOM! It all fell into place.<BR>   There's a ballad on all of Beck's 'Mainstream' releases: 'Blackhole' and 'Steal my Body Home' off \\"Mellow Gold\\", 'Ramshackle' off Odelay, and even the song 'Beautiful Way' off \\"Midnite Vultures\\". And as others have pointed out, there's a funky album for every thoughtful one. <BR>\\"Sea Change\\" may make you see the beauty in this amazing double-artist.<BR>   (BTW- Just a fun fact: Track 7 on the album 'It's All in Your Mind' Is actually 10 years old as well. It was released as a follow up 7\\" record to \\"One Foot in the Grave\\". It had that track, the song 'Feather in your Cap' (which was later re-done as well for the Suburbia soundtrack), and 'Whiskey Can-Can'. If you ever see it, pick it up to hear the original, stripped-down version of this great song)

0226264017|3.0|Being more a follower of the Austrian school of economics, I <BR>thought this was a weak theroetical defense of economic freedom.<BR>There was just not enough principled description of the line<BR>separating free individual action for government interference<BR>in such action.

B00006L3LD|5.0|I totally thought that it was worth buying the morning view cd for the 2nd time just to get the bonus dvd. Hey a hard core Incubus fan has to do what they have to do. I had to make sure that I could keep my collection complete to date. So I love the dvd..it's funny as hell, and I totally luv it! INCUBUS I LUV YA!!
B000002G0P|5.0|Words cannot express how good this album is. It is absolutely exquisite, perfect from start to finish. It's also one of the most emotionally moving albums I've heard. <br />There are too many standout moments to mention here, but I must point out Nuno and Pat's minutes-long matching note-for-note solo in &quot;Cupid's Dead&quot; (Pat's bass lines are out of this world throughout the entire song actually), and Nuno's incredibly moving and expressive solo in &quot;Stop The World&quot;. WHAT - A - RIPPER.<br />How tragic that it came out when grunge started to become the in-thing. It truly deserved MUCH more appreciation than it got. It was sadly not to be for Extreme's finest moment.
B000068IEU|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is atrocious, the storyline unbelievable and the production values zero!! Save your money!!
B00003CY0V|2.0|... <BR>Yeah ... it's true ... John Travolta really looks out of place and Halle Berry is obviously just paid eye-candy. On the positive side though, the script is tight and concise (even if it is a little predictible), Hugh Jackman is really pretty good, and there's a pretty good number of well-shot action scenes.<BR>Sure, it's not exactly the next Citizen Kane, but it's certainly worth plunking down a few bucks to rent with a clear conscience....Lighten up a little bit guys...
B00005JKWI|5.0|I absolutely loved &quot;Blade&quot;. I am not familiar with the comic book character other than Blade is half human and half vampire. The special effects in that movie blew me away. I was a bit wary of the sequal but after seeing &quot;Blade II&quot;, that movie was just as good as the first. I'm a huge vampire fanatic and the last vampire film (&quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;) turned out to be a real turkey. &quot;Blade II&quot; definitely didn't disappoint me. I found the idea of Blade working with his enemies to eradicate this new breed of super vampires compelling. I must admit I was rather grossed out by these super vampires and watching them feed. When Blade rescued his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristopherson), I wondered if Whistler was going to turn out like Blade; half-man, half-vampire since he was infected with the same vampire virus. Some of the humorous moments in the movie came from Ron Pearlman's vampire character . My favorite character in the movie  I have to say is the vampire named Lisa, played by Leonor Varela.  I liked how strong-willed her character was. What I really enjoyed was the twists that the storyline of the movie took. I really didn't expect for how the movie ended and for one of the major characters in the film. Obviously Wesley Snipes watched &quot;The Matrix&quot; very carefully because a lot of the fighting scenes in the movie were heavily influenced by &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Now while &quot;Blade II&quot; is by no means Shakespeare, it definitely is one of the few modern vampire films that I thoroughly enjoyed without nitpicking the storyline apart. Truly an action classic.

078322818X|5.0|\\"American Graffiti\\" is great inspirational classic that can really grab your attention. Not only are the great cool-looking cars great, and the top soundtrack is, too, but the storyline is great. Set on a late summer night in 1962, four high school friends, two of them are graduates, spend their last night together before the two leave for college. At first at the beginning with that timeless \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" playing over Steve's (Ronny Howard) car radio in his marvelous '58 Chevy which I adore, the four friends meet at the local drive-in called Mel's. There is Curt (Richard Dreyfuss, Steve, John (Paul Le Mat), and Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith). They are all uncertain of their futures. Curt and Steve are the ones leaving for college, but Curt doesn't know for sure if he's going. Steve <BR>is raring to go at first. As the night progresses, they split from Mel's. Curt goes wth his sister Laurie (Cindy Williams) and Steve to the hop. John goes looking for s good time, and on the lookout for a could-be-next-drag-racing champ in a black '55 Chevy. The Toad is just out cruising around like everybody else on the main strip. Later, he meets Debby (Candy Clark), a sort of mixed-up girl who puts Toad in the wrong direction almost. John gets an unexpected surprise from a Studebaker when a 15-year old girl named Carol (Makenzie Phillips) cruises around with him. John's not thrilled at first, but Carol eventually grows on him, when they both flatten the tires and spray shaving cream all over a white '59 Dodge, and when John finally meets his maker in the '55 Chevy called Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford), or when John goes to the a junkyard filled with old cars as he shows Carol who was the best of the best in drag-racing. Curt gets mixed up with a non-threating but cool gang called the Pharaohs led by Joe (Bo Hopkins). These are crazy and funny, and I love that maroon '51 Mercury. Steve and Laurie try to figure out what to do with their lives once Steve leaves, which causes them to break up. Curt meets Wolfman Jack who plays the great songs over the radio as they both try to find out who the mysterious and beautiful blonde is in the white '56 T-Bird. This and more all leads up to the race between John and Bob Falfa. This moment is stunning and a keep-you-on-the-of-your-seat moment. Could Falfa be the new champ? Both race fast down the road, when Falfa's Chevy spins off the road and topples over into falmes. Falfa and Laurie, who gets picked up earlier that night make it out okay as Steve and John try to tear them apart.<BR>Steve and Laurie happily runite, and John wins the race but losing his crown as champ. Curt meanwhile gets in touch with the blonde, but her identity is still mysterious. The end is at the airport, where they all meet again. Curt decides to go, bidding his friends and family good-bye. As he is on the plane, he looks out the window and sees the white T-Bird going down the road. After this shot we see the pictures of the four guys and the following: <BR>John Milner was killed by a drunk driver in December 1964.<BR>Terry Fields was reported missing in action near An Loc in December 1965.<BR>Steve Bolander is an insurance agent in Modesto, California.<BR>Curt Henderson is a writer living in Canada.<br />A true must-see coming of age story that everyone should see.
B000002LRX|5.0|I first became an FNM fan with The Real Thing. That album totally blew my mind, so the day Angel Dust came out I naturally rushed out and bought my copy. At first I was a bit disappointed as it sounded totally different. After a couple of listens I realised it was the best album I had ever heard, light years ahead of the Real Thing, if that's at all possible. From the stark, shocking artwork to the songs on the CD, it is a masterpiece.<br />It seems that everybody has their own interpretations of what the songs are about (and I have my own ideas too) but the feelings I got from the songs - loneliness, sadness, fear, aggression, but at the same time elation, were just as important. Angel Dust came out at a time in my life as a young adult when I was feeling those exact same emotions, and it was just like a soundtrack to my life back then, as if they could see inside my head. <br />Every song is mindblowing but if I could possibly come up with some standouts they would be the frightening Caffeine (I actually think they're chickens and a cow at the beginning, just like on the back cover), the extremely catchy Mid Life Crisis, the feeling of hopelessness and redundancy in Smaller and Smaller, the powerful Everything's Ruined, the incredibly aggressive Malpractice, more hopelessness in Kindergarten, the rollercoaster ride that is A Small Victory, the nightmarish Jizzlobber and Midnight Cowboy - such a gentle song after such a powerful album, that it brings out all the emotions. <br />Of course the guys are still in top form - the reason I started worshipping FNM in the first place. How could this music be the same without Jim Martin's harnessed electricity guitar-playing, Bill Gould's virtuoso bass techniques, Mike Bordin's powerful and intricate drum patterns, Roddy Bottum's eerie keyboard ambience and Mike Patton's versatile vocals, all setting the scene for the one-hour fright rollercoaster ride ahead. <br />Tragically I can't say the same thing for their subsequent releases, which never captured the same combination of intensity, musicianship or lyrics that was found here (Jim Martin was sorely missed). Mike Patton said this album was &quot;self-conscious&quot; - I don't agree, I think &quot;King for a Day&quot; was the self-conscious album, trying too hard to be the opposite of Angel Dust's dark and menacing mood. <br />When you buy this precious album you won't know how you survived without it.<br />Mike P, Mike B, Roddy, Bill and Jim, it's been 10 years. THANK YOU SO MUCH for Angel Dust.
6301016289|4.0|This was a pretty nice movie. I saw it over a friends house and we both liked it since we both play the ponies( stock market). I must say first i think tom cruise probably would have been a better choice for lead actor, and i would have been disappointed if i had went to see it at the movies, but it is a nice book to watch at home for fun, and worth money amazon.com wants for it. This stuff really does happen, and the way the movie tells it is really how things go down. You can get in real trouble if you get caught doing this. Just ask Martha Stewart and a bunch of former Enron execs.

0441172717|4.0|Considered one of the best science fiction novels ever written, Dune includes all of the elements which earned it that title. A world shaped through all facets of life - politics, religion, interpersonal relationships, environment - Dune reveals itself not with long descriptive passages explaining the culture, but by depositing you within that culture and leaving you, as the reader, to make sense of it through scattered hints and immersion.<br />For this, I commend the novel. Most science fiction authors get caught up explaining to the reader the world in which the story takes place - to the detriment of the story itself. Herbert does not fall into this trap, and the story is strong because of it.<br />Dune is not an easy read, mainly due to the above mentioned immersion approach to introducing the reader to the landscape of the novel. It requires concentration to sort out the different elements of the story. Several story lines radiate from the central arc, and it can be disconcerting trying to piece them together into one cohesive timeline. I can see where slower readers might become frustrated with the novel to the point of putting it down. However the patient will be rewarded with a thoughtful story, which although reaches no concrete conclusion (I can only assume that the sequels provide the &quot;end&quot; of the story) weaves a compelling adventure well worth the time and effort.
0790731894|5.0|It is ironic that after 9/11 Hollywood shies away from directly dealing with Islamic terrorism. So much so, that the very recently released The Sum of All Fears based on Tom Clancy's novel changes the identity of the evil doers from fervent Islamicists to ultra right-wing Nazis. The earlier Executive Decision was filmed in 1996. It addresses forthrightly, without fear of politically correct reprisals, the menace of Islamic radicalism. A few scenes even have the terrorists speaking Arabic to each other. In many ways, Executive Decision, warned us about the possibility of the attacks of 9/11. The actor who primarily makes this film work is David Suchet who portrays the diabolical Nagi Hassan, a dedicated Islamicist who hates the United States with an unrelenting passion. He ultimately plans to use a hijacked airplane as something of a heavy duty bomb to murder millions of American citizens. This fiendish individual is committed to sacrifice his own life, but hides the final aspect of the scheme from his fellow terrorists. The latter believe that they are merely participating in a plot to free a fellow Islamic radical. Hassan fails to inform them that they are on a suicidal mission. Does this not remind one of the hijackers of 9/11? Osama bin Ladin also did not tell most of those 19 hijackers that they were going to die on that fateful day.<br />What about Kurt Russell, Steven Segal, Halle Barry, and the other very fine performers? I will be blunt: the primary focus should be on the Nagi Hassan character. It is a very accurate depiction of the extremist Islamic terrorist mindset. Did the fast paced action thriller Executive Decision unwittingly provide a few ideas to those Islamic radicals who almost certainly viewed this film? The answer must be a reluctant yes. Should anyone therefore involved in the production of Executive Decision feel guilty? Not in the least. Artists usually cannot be blamed if the malevolent inclined interpret their work in a manner not to their liking. This is a must see movie. The Nagi Hassans are not merely the figment of a creative writer's imagination, but real live threats to our American values and freedoms. Executive Decision earns five stars.liking.

B00005ASHM|5.0|It really is quite fine, as pop, and as music which transcends its category. You get everything in mono &amp; stereo versions. For most tracks, the lovingly perfect original mono mixes were impossible to top. Only Sloop John B sounds better in stereo cuz the bass guitar gets more room.

0345350499|5.0|I've read many books and this one will always remain one of the best, one of the most memorable, the most favorite. I read it many years ago and I have a hard time remembering what the minuses of the book were, but the good aspects spring to mind immediately. <br />It is a book full of magic - if you read to escape and experience a different world, you'll be literally transported by this one. If plot is your thing, this book can't go wron with its Arthurian legend that spans many decades and the protagonist's entire life. And if what you like most are characters - well, this novel Breathes. After reading, you will never forget Morgan and Lancelot. <br />Sometimes you feel like reading a good novel and you're usure which to buy - you don't want to waste the money, or the time with a bad selection. BUY this book ... And once you're done reading, you'll want to keep a copy of it forever. Promise.
0140186409|4.0|I had to read this book for school, I was very skeptical at first, but it turned out to be fantastic. An amazing story about one family's hardships as they search for a better life. I recommend this book to everyone I come across.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Here's my take on the latest entry in the Elvis greatest hits compilation sweepstakes.  It is without question the best single-disc collection available.  And I'm sure that RCA hopes this has the same kind of sales that the Beatles 2000 release &quot;1&quot; had.  [That probably explains the spelling of his name--ELV1S--in the title.]  And so far it's working--the album is No. 1 on Billboard's charts the first week of its release.<br />Is this this the ONLY Elvis you'll ever need?  Depends.  If you're a casual fan, probably.  The serious fan will want it just to get the JXL radio edit remix of 1968's &quot;A Little Less Conversation,&quot; whose late addition made it the 31st No. 1 hit of Elvis' career.  [Also, do ALL copies include the 12-minute 1960 post-army interview CD that mine did?]<br />In addition, this updates RCA's 1987 18-track &quot;The Number One Hits&quot; by also including his British No. 1's.  Elvis' last U.S. No. 1 was 1969's &quot;Suspicious Minds.&quot; But &quot;The Wonder of You&quot; (1970), &quot;Burning Love&quot; (1972) and &quot;Way Down&quot; all hit the top spot in the U.K.  In fact, &quot;Way Down&quot; (1976) spent five weeks at No. 1. The other big surprise was 1960's &quot;Wooden Heart,&quot; taken from the movie G.I. Blues.  [The song was not released as a single in the U.S.]<br />My only concern is that I hope it's not just old Elvis fans (like me) that are buying this disc.  This is music that should transcend generations.  And a quick peak at any given week's Billboard chart is evidence enough that today's artists could benefit from a little influence from the king of rock 'n' roll.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00004T9UF|4.0|I listened to this a little while after the somewhat forgotten Slim Shady LP and I think that this is pretty good. The positive side of this album is that Eminem has a more serious tone throughout; his lyrics have become more defensive; the sometimes sickening lyrics about killing women, that the Slim Shady LP had, are starting to disapear (although \\"Kill You\\" does standout as his most misogynistic song yet IMO); ... There are some really good songs here as well. However, this is not the masterpiece many see it as...<br />The reason for this is that Eminem stopped writing all those carefully constructed lyrics that shined in The Slim Shady LP like \\"Brain Damage\\" or \\"I'm Shady\\". His lyrics aren't really too creative this time. The now-old \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" doesn't do too much for me. Disses at pop stars like Christina Agulera or Britney Spears are rather uninteresting. I miss those Lauren Hill or Garth Brooks disses that were much more thought out. But enough about that. Also, ...  he throws punches at the gay & lesbian groups. .... Another thing is that on some songs, he just tries too hard to shock you in songs like \\"Kill You\\" and \\"Criminal\\". Don't much care for that. Further more, the song \\"Kim\\". I have no problem with it's subject matter (kinda low however; Eminem killing his wife for cheating), but it's the music that counts about it, so I will say this: first, the chorus makes no sense. Second, the first time I heard the song, I could not tell if he was rapping at all (it sounded like a really disturbing skit with a beat). Third, this is an inferior prequel to \\"97 Bonnie And Clyde\\". I naturally heard that song first, and (call me sick) I thought it was funny in a dark way. But hearing \\"Kim\\" ruins the black comedy that you could've experienced with the other song. Finally, \\"Amityville\\" has an awful guest appearance by D-12's Bizarre (no offence to Bizarre). All of this mars the album...<br />...but not too much. This album is still a irreverent look at Eminem in 2000. There are some excellent songs on here. The best song would have to be the \\"Come On Everybody\\" esque \\"Drug Ballad\\". IT really takes us back to the old, forgotten days. IT will always stand the test of time for me. Also, \\"Under The Influence\\" (with D-12) is a lyrical assault on the sences. Probably D12's best. Other Standouts include \\"Stan\\", \\"Who Knew\\" \\"Remember Me\\" (with RBX and Sticky Fingaz), \\"I'm Back\\", \\"B***h Please 2\\" (with great appearances by Dr.Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, and Nate Dogg), and \\"Criminal\\". <br />I definetely wouldn't recommend this to everybody. This is the album that once gave him a household name status. It's nowhere near as good as his debut, but you can still enjoy, regardless of how terribly old it's gotten. Check it out if you still haven't. peace...<br />BTW, how did Eminem have any knowledge that this would be so successful? He mentions it throughout some of his songs. Strange...
B00005JKG5|5.0|This movie is an incredible snapshot of everything hot about the 1980's. With the new genre of music videos becoming popular, the youth of this decade were crying out for a film that combined both incredible music with an incredible visual accompanyment. This movie delivers. Almost every scene appears to have been shot to suit the music rather than the other way around. The charachter Beals plays is believable and likeable and her fight to succeed will break your heart and lift your spirits.  <br />The typical Cinderella plot works as a complicated storyline would detract from what is essentially the star of this movie, dance.<BR>It inspired me, along many other girls to become a dancer.<BR>It will inspire you.
B00003CXE7|5.0|So far, I've never seen a more enthraling movie like \\"Gladiator.\\"  I saw it when it came out, and I bought it as soon as it came out on DVD.  <BR>The plot of \\"Gladiator\\" centers around Maximus (Russell Crowe), a decorated Roman general who wants only to go home, but the Emperor (Richard Harris) names Maximus his successor.  His immoral son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) gets jealous, kills his own father, and orders Maximus executed.  However, the good general escapes, only to be captured by slave traders and bred as a gladiator--a killing machine with a single purpose: to entertain the crowds of the Colosseum.  <BR>\\"Gladiator\\" is blessed with fine acting, photography, sets, and costumes--not to mention the bold score by the always fabulous Hans Zimmer.  Director Ridley Scott knows how to entertain, as he keeps the action scenes exciting but not too gory.  Even the slower parts are showered with tension, a true sign of a great drama.  Simply put, everyone should see this movie.  It's the best movie of 2000, and certainly worth of its five Oscars including Best Picture.
B00000253N|5.0|In my book, this is not only the greatest Dylan album, but the greatest album ever made by anyone, anytime.  There isn't a single throwaway track, or one that misses its mark.  The lyrics are amazing (the man is truly a poet!), and additionally it's very listen-able, something I can't say about all of his work, much as I admire it.  I've been listening to this album for going on twenty years now, and it never gets old.  Do yourself a favor, buy it now!
B000067DNC|5.0|What a surprising treasure of cool stories! Of course some are a little lame, but I was really surprised at the originality of the show's episodes overall. It was easy to forget that McGuyver is the main character and it's not nearly as cheesy as one would expect. The effects are good, perhaps little too sparse at times. Acting is pretty impressive, though sometimes they take themselves very seriously and go for oscar moments, but it's minimal. After watching the 2'nd season (in a few nights), I purchased the 1'st. It's not as good, but I'm glad to own these, they're definitely keepers.
B00004T9UH|1.0|I have both versions of this CD. I was just curious about the editing on this. I'm not offended by so-called \\"bad\\" language, but here's the problem with it:<br />The Marshall Mathers LP was protested against for it's homophobic and misogynistic lyrics. So in their haste, the editors made a clean version of this CD) The homophobic part was dealt with mostly (they took out ... ), but they left in ... in most places. If you listen to \\"Kill You\\" you will notice that in the beginning of the first verse, the words ... ... are not edited. ok so far. but then, it seems like the editors have just given up on that; there are way too many of these words for them to keep up with. All thru the rest of the album, those words are heard. However, most of the edited stuff are references to guns (glock, mack 11, even the word \\"gun\\", etc.) violence, drugs, etc. <br />I actually think that the editors were more worried about editing \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" more than anything else. You don't hear any swearing there. I don't know if it matters, but when he does the Will Smith diss, that's the only time you actually hear \\"bleep\\" sounds. That's all they cared about editing. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing that the kids wanted to hear from the album was \\"The Real Slim Shady\\". Another example of commercialism. After all, that song was being shoved down everyone's throat, that's all they would wanna listen to. <br />I addition, not surprisingly, the song \\"Kim\\" was taken out of here. It was replaced by the South Park spoof \\"The Kids\\". To be honest, I haven't listened to the whole song through. Becuase that is edited, it's too hard to understand what he's talking about, making the track unappealing. I am aware that the song is on imports of this CD, but I don't wanna waste my time over it, so i'll forget about it.<br />Speaking of South Park, you know they have that semi-humorous warning at the beginning before the theme song? It says \\"the content should not be viewed by anyone\\". Same here. If you don't like the sort of thing that you hear Eminem say, don't listen to him at all. Just get the unedited version and be happy, cuz you, my friend, will become a man. Not a ...  who won't even listen to Godsmack just because it has a PA label on it. Grow up. get the original. It won't hurt. Trust me.<br />Peace...

0316666343|1.0|I have to admit that I had very high expectations of this book after seeing it top the book charts for so long. I think people are comforted about the fact that their was depiction of heaven. Anyone who has ever lost a loved one despite the circumstances surrounding the death has to have a certain curiosity of the after life. I only read about 200 pages of this book and decided I would rather be reading a good Stephen King novel.

B00006690G|1.0|I'm not an ordinary hater, but I just think that this is a pretentious, annoying, boring piece of garbage now. The constant radio play and recital of teen-angst style rap lyrics has killed him. His style change from off-the-wall ryhmes to complicated overemphasis on depressed teens, disgusts me.<br />I liked this before, but [it] got old after time passed long enough. What happened to the definition of \\"sick yet disturbingly humorous\\" lyrics? What happened to the flawless flow of the conceptual tracks ...? What happened to the unintelligent wit he used in freestlye battles (ex. \\"How can I give a damn? I don't know what a damn is to give it!\\")?<br />What happened to all the fun? I can anwser that at least. .... *phew*<br />Nowadays, Eminem's lyrics reminds me of KoRn's lyrics: self-centered, unreasonably hostile, and full of false misery. <br />No, I would not recommend this disc, but I would certainly recommend you to check out his earlier work, even The Marshall Mathers LP. It's far more fun, less annoying and overemphasized on teen-angst.
B00006AW2G|5.0|...though my favorite Stones song is not on this album- that honor goes to Can't You Hear Me Knocking on Sticky Fingers.  Still, this album contains their other best songs, every one is great, even the song not sung by Mick, You Got the Silver, has a gentle, Dylan like quality to it.  And of course, there are the classics: the Vietnam war inspired Gimme Shelter, the drug pumped Monkey Man, the melodic You Can't Always Get What You Want, the menacing and echoing Midnight Rambler, a total blues song (Love in Vain) and a total country song (Country Honk), and two other trademark Stones songs (Let it Bleed, Live with Me).  For rock fans of today who want to start listening to the \\"Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\\", as it's quoted, or for fans of the Stones who are out of touch, this is the first to grab a hold of.  A rock masterpiece.
B00006G8K0|5.0|This is without question the best of the classic Dracula movies and perhaps the best offering ever from Hammer studios. Loosly based on the Stoker novel this movie made Christopher Lee a star. Peter Cushing is nothing short of brilliant as Dr. Van Helsing and the scene in which he destroys Dracula (this time) is magnificent.

Having read other books on Special Forces by the likes of Clancy, Beckwith, etc. there will be no comparison with Black Hawk.<br />Interestingly enough, the Author also was able to persuade some of the Delta Force's own to speak off the record as to what happen which is more than any other current writer has been able to do.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is a must have for any collector.  The price is a little steep, but I think it is worth every penny. I had seen GF I and GF II years ago.  This is one movie you enjoy even more the second time you watch it. I also recommend the fifth add-ons disk. I just finished a marathon session and watched all the DVDs again. I personally prefer keep cases instead of the cardboard cases included. I wish: (1) Robert DeNiro had a longer role and they had shown some transition from Robert DeNiro to Marlon Brando in part II. (2) Robert Duval should have been part of GF III. (3) Marlon Brando should have accepted the oscar.
B00005V9IK|5.0|In 1996, a film called Independence Day exploded onto the world and caused a frenzy in the Box Office. The film is the second most successful sci-fi film of all-time after Star Wars in 1997. Independence Day grossed a staggering $811 million worldwide - the highest box office gross of a sci-fi film on its original release and made huge stars of Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Independence Day is without a doubt one of the greatest films of all-time. Yes, the script may be corny at times, but the special effects are absolutely mind-blowing! And that's waht makes a good action film, isn't it? People want to see the special effects and be entertained. Films like these aren't meant to have depth and meaning - they're purely there to entertain you and Independence Day definitely does that! The storyline to Independence Day is pretty basic really...<br /><br />An alien space ship one-fourth the mass of the moon is headed toward Earth, and no one is sure what will happen when it arrives. The president of the United States (Bill Pullman) can only watch as the ship settles into orbit and dispatches several \\"smaller\\" craft that take position above every major city in the world. While the president tries to prevent a panic, few people can stay calm at the sight of 15-mile-long space ships hovering over their cities. When Marine Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is called to duty, he's sure the aliens didn't fly all this way just to pick a fight - but he tells his girlfriend to take her son and leave Los Angeles, just in case. Meanwhile, computer genius David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) discovers that the aliens are using Earth's satellites for their own purpose. In fact, they are counting down. David rounds up his eccentric father (Judd Hirsch) and sets off to explain what's happening to his ex-wife (Margaret Colin). She's the president's communication director, and when David tells her what the aliens are up to, she convinces the president to listen. He quickly orders the cities evacuated and rushes to Air Force One. As the countdown reaches zero, the aliens show the people of Earth exactly what they are planning. They begin an all-out war with no negotiation, no compromise and no mercy. In fact, the human race may well have only one chance to save itself from complete extermination. They realise that all the space ships have an incredibly powerful protective barrier around them. When bombs are sent flying towards the ships, they just bounce off like a tennis ball. Levinson flies into space towards the mother ship with Steven Hiller to infiltrate the ship with a virus which in turn will remove the protective barrier from all the space ships hovering over the Earth's major cities. Independence Day really is the BIG and ultimate sci-fi film of the 1990's. Director by Ronald Emmerich does a brilliant job with giving the audience a fantastic, thrilling time. Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are the main two and are excellent in their roles and the comedy factor of the film works rather well, unlike in some other films that are disasterous in trying to get the audience to laugh. The way the film is worked around is an ingenious idea - the fact that all this happens around the days on July 4th and that the world fights back in unison on Independence Day is brilliant.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />Regardless of whether your a fan of sci-fi films with an overall Star Wars feel (I hate all the Star Wars films), you will enjoy this film because it's so gripping and suspenseful. They don't spend 30 minutes talking a load of jibberish like in some other films - they get straight into what the film is about. Which I suppose can be a good thing or a bad thing - but in this case it's definitely the former. The final battle where they finally gain access to destroying the space ships is absolutely incredible - the sheer size of these ships is indescribable and the way the ship is finally destroyed is huge - like the Titanic sinking (in the film) but 100 times more epic and monsterous!

B00003CXCW|5.0|SUNSET BOULEVARD is, along with \\"All About Eve\\", my favorite film from 1950. It is a true masterpiece and one of the best loved films. The story revolves around a failed screenwriter Joe Gilles (William Holden) who stumbles into the mansion of the aged silent-film-supreme-movie-star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who lives a life of reclusion. As she feeds the crazy illusion of still being adored by her fans, she plans a comeback not knowing that the whole world has long ago forgotten her. Only her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim) - who was once her director (!) and husband (!) - supports her diva-like behavior.<br />The true greatness of this film is something that demands multiple discussions. But for me, the thing I like best is the bitter irony, acid/dark humour and relentless madness that runs through the entire film. Norma Desmond is, arguably, the craziest character ever written for the screen and also one of its most fascinating. The screenplay is a landmark in modern cinema. It combines powerful drama with dark comedy like no other. It touches many great issues like vanity, idolatry, the ephemeral nature of fame, the need for self esteem, the need for love... This is also a film where Hollywood looks at itself and examines its own basis: the star-system. The art direction is beautiful: check out Norma's living room and her relationship with her own photographs! - just as an example.<br />Just like you would expect, a vast trail of cameos appear on the film as themselves: Buster Keaton, Cecil B. deMille and Hedda Hopper just to name a few. Rich dialog is also a major asset in this great film. So are the costumes (by the master Edith Head), Cinematography and Music (by Franz Waxman). An interesting note is that it is a dead character who tells the story.<br />This DVD edition has many charming extras: first a great documentary about Edith Head: the woman behind Hollywood's most glamorous clothes. It was she who designed the costumes for many best-loved films like Shane, Sabrina and most of the Hitchcock American films. She was the leading costume designer for Paramount Pictures. Second, two featurettes about the making of Sunset Blvd. and the music score. It would be great if all classic movies were presented like this...<br />Buy this film.ike Shane, Sabrina and most of the Hitchcock American films.

B0000640SA|5.0|Listen up, all detractors and naysayers: THERE IS NO FLAW. Look closer, please.<br />That's it. I can't take it. I've already reviewed this movie AND this limited edition, but apparently I need to clear the air about this, since nobody else is. THERE IS NO FLAW.<br />The \\"flaw(s)\\" I am referring to is Leonard's remembering things like <br />(1) his condition, <BR>(2) Burt's name \\"You don't have to be that honest, Burt,\\" in reference to finding out he is booked in two rooms, <BR>(3) how many facts are listed on his body without looking (last scene, writes on card the fact number # without looking and then writes the license of Teddy's car), <BR>(4) from a sequential perspective, after Leonard finds that Teddy tricked him and is confronted with the truth, he becomes distrustful of Teddy. Note his behavior towards Teddy BEFORE he looks at \\"Don't believe his lies.\\" Leonard goes from being very trusting of \\"Officer Gamel\\" (in the black and white sequences) to being entirely distrustful of \\"Teddy\\" (for example, in the tatoo parlor, or in the Jaguar \\"who the f--- are you?!?).<br />... If you will so much as just LISTEN to the director's commentary, he'll tell you as much! He flat-out tells us that the POINT of the movie is the DIFFERENT WAYS we remember things, apart from just our brain! The point is that we remember with MORE than just the part of the brain that Leonard had damaged; further, we remember with more than our brains.<br />Let's think this through, shall we? Assuming Teddy's honesty, which Nolan verifies on one of the audio tracks at the end, we can deduce several truths:<br />(1) What happenned to Sammy Jankis and his wife is actually Leonard's situation. Thus,<BR>a. Leonard's condition was something that his wife could not cope with<BR>b. Leonard's wife tricked him into overdosing her on insulin; she goes into a coma and dies <BR>c. Leonard is incapable of understanding her situation and is put in an institution<br />(2) Teddy, the police officer assigned tohis case, busts him out somehow (for info on this, go to otnemem.com).<br />(3) Leonard at some point in this process begins to CONDITION himself to recount the facts of his life differently. This includes:<BR>a. He convinces himself that his wife died during the attack.<BR>b. He convinces himself that his wife was not diabetic.<BR>c. He transposes all these facts and guilt as belonging to Sammy Jankis (listen closely to his guilt over the whole thing ...there is a level of self-involvement the Leonard of the flashbacks would never have).<br />(4) Leonard has CONDITIONED himself to react to his murder and beatings of others in a way that hides the truth from him. <BR>a. Leonard and Teddy have been working for a year or so, going from town to town and killing the \\"John G.'s\\" that Teddy sets up for his own reasons. <BR>b. Notice Leonard's instinct and automatic behavior during a physical confrontation. Compare his actions during the murder of Jimmy Grants and his actions after beating Dodd unconscious. He moved quickly, methodically. <BR>c. After murder, he assumes the clothes and identity of the person killed in order to hide his true actions from himself. Further, after beating someone, he automatically immobilizes them and calls Teddy.<br />(5) THE WHOLE POINT OF THE MOVIE IS THAT LEONARD IS HIDING THE TRUTH FROM HIMSELF, HE IS \\"USING\\" HIMSELF FAR MORE THAN ANY PERSONS HE ENCOUNTERS. HE IS \\"USED\\" BY THEM BECAUSE ON SOME LEVEL HE WANTS TO BE. Thus, Teddy died, not because he used Leonard, but because he was a threat to Leonard's systemized method of lies and truth-hiding.<br />There, that's it. Have a different point of view or see a flaw in my reasoning, feel free to email me with it AFTER YOU RESEARCH THE WEBSITE *AND* LISTEN TO THE DIRECTOR'S COMMENTARY.<br />I suppose that is that.
B00005UDE7|4.0|I have been a fan from back when that Dominic dude was their singer. ... I was hooked when they brought LaBrie on board and released Images and Words. That album is an all time classic. They seemed to get better with every release. Every release that is except this one. Don't get me wrong though, this CD is absolutely amazing but when you've set the bar so high in the past, it's hard to keep bettering yourself. The musicianship on this CD is second to none. Mike Portnoy's timekeeping still rattles my mind. He is a man possessed on this CD. Myung's bass is stellar as always. Petrucci is god on guitar and he comes through again on this CD although I think he's had better stuff on previous CD's. LaBrie is stunning. His voice gets better with each CD. And Rudess blows my mind on the keys. This CD is probably his best performance. His playing mends seemlessly within each song. The problem with this CD is not the musicianship. There's no denying that these guys are the masters at what they do. The problem is the songwriting. Every single song has points of brilliance but they aren't consistent throughout the entire song. \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" is a perfect example. This songs races out of the gate at a blistering pace. The timing is intense, the riffs are in your face. The vocals are screaming at you and then they dump some goofy vocal part at the end of the chorus. Listen and you'll understand. It's like this in every song. I also have to say that the other members of the ban should STAY AWAY from the mic! Let LaBrie do what he does best and you guys do what you do best. There are some parts where the backing vocals are awful. OK, now that I've said that...Go buy this album! Like I said, Dream Theater has spoiled us so many times in the past that this was going to happen sooner or later. All said, it's still one of the greatest progressive metal albums of all time. Dream Theater has stayed true to their fans and their roots on this CD. Each song seems to go onwithout end, but it's over before you know it. The complexity of the music will make your head spin. BUY THIS CD!!!!
B000002OX3|5.0|A really super album of catchy pop songs. Not the who at their best, but still incredibly amazing.
B00005JL96|5.0|Last night I watched this film and really think it's one of the best Disney features for a long time on the grounds of depth, originality and animation. <br />The plot is very strong and they [Disney], at last, tackle some very sensitive issues without ambiguity. <br />I was surprised by the completely different approach to family aspect in the film and was considerably engaged by many moments in the film. For the first time in cinema, I felt like I wanted to applaud at the end. <br />Still shocked by how much this film means to me. <br />Themes play on your mind - like a very good play by Brecht or Orton, you walk out entertained but also educated.<br />This DVD is one of two versions - Disney plan to release a Special Edition two months later. Maybe we should hold on and wait for it.
B0000683DH|4.0|This is more like it!<br />While the DVD for \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" was just fine, the extras were, for the most part, overladen with the all too typical Paramount marketeering. The interviews played more like infomercials for Trek merchandise than legit extras about that least understood or appreciated Trek film. No so here, with the brand-spanking new edition of \\"Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan\\"! The interviews on this disc are (mostly) exactly what they ought to be; informative, and giving the viewer/fan a new perspective on the film and the classic Trek show and cast.<br />While the extras are extensive and overall fairly well-done, the best part of this new director's cut is the return of missing scenes. Most of these are emotional scenes with Scotty that we're all aware of, but there are other things as well.<br />Most notable of these restored scenes is the quiet moment when Kirk confesses to McCoy that they were still alive after a Khan attack because Kirk knew a secret about the ships that Khan didn't. A great Kirk moment that should never have been cut, just like the Scotty scenes. With the added bits restored, the movie plays so much better you can't help but feel it.<br />The special effects shot where the ship leaves dry dock is the same cut from the original version of ST:TMP, where the black special effects armature is still visible on the secondary hull. Why they didn't splice in the updated cut from the ST:TMP director's cut is a mystery. But that's part of what made ST:TWOK so much of an improvement over ST:TMP; new effects and radical re-editing were not needed in order to spruce up the \\"Khan\\" film, even twenty years later.<br />The only real downer here has to be the interview with Greg Cox, included in the extras on Disc 2. This segment plays more like a mockumentary than anything else, and Mr. Cox (author of a Khan revisionist history), was a poor subject to interview. He comes off as the stereotypical \\"Trekkie\\", the unfair and unkind nerd image that so plagues the entire spectrum of sci-fi fandom. The whole segment was played for laughs at Mr. Cox's expense, and at the expense of the \\"Trekkie\\" group of Trek fans. An unfortunate and puzzling inclusion in an otherwise excellent disc (I had to take at least one star off for this).<br />Despite any minor quibbles, this is the best Trek movie so far, and looks fantastic on this DVD. If you like Trek, you'll want this disc, even if you currently own the pared-down standard version that was previously released.<br />Buy it. Believe me, it's worth it.erd image that so plagues the entire spectrum of sci-fi fandom.

B0000542D2|5.0|Video of extreme clarity. Audio in stereo. Both redone. I'm not an expert on DVD artifacts but none were apparent. All nuances and antics by the Fab Four, as The Beatles were sometimes called, are crystal clear. The Bonuses are great and explain a lot about the era, The Beatles, and others involved in the production of this film. It's sad that at least one project is missing from this DVD set, but in my opinion it does not detract from this set.<br />The DVD stands as a marvelous compilation of good, clean fun, with the worst being the cigarette smoking on the film which is kept to a minimum. Even the bonus interviews are full of positive praises for everyone involved.<br />Remember the party scene when The Beatles are then interviewed by the media? The hostesses would come by with a platter and just as each was about to reach for a sandwich, the hostess would walk away. It was their party and they just could not get a bite to eat! The film also includes some intelectual comedy understood only by mature audiences.<br />Everything considered, I found it to be a great DVD set. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys getting a glimpse on how one of the revolutions of the 60s was fueled to explode, the humanity of being a 'star', musicals, abstract comedy, art, fun, and the Fab Four at their finest in their first film. Fabulous!
0385335482|5.0|I had been given this book as a gift. I didn't think I would enjoy the book so I put it on my bookshelf, where it collected dust for about a year. Out of sheer boredom one day, I picked up the book and started reading it. Well! I instantly fell in love! I read Confessions of a Shopaholic in one day and ran to the bookstore the next day to buy Shopaholic Takes Manhattan. I loved Sophie Kinsella's informal writing style - I actually felt as though I was inside the head of the main character and could feel every emotion she was feeling - what a hystericaly funny ride!  Confessions of a Shopaholic was definately one of the most entertaining books I have read in a long time.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Twenty-five years after his death, Elvis scores his first album to hit number one the first week it opens.  In at least twelve countries.  \\"My boy, my boy....\\"<br />In the 1980's, I was watching a documentary about the horrible conditions of city dwellers in India--and I saw a black velvet tapestry of Elvis Presley hanging in the streets of Calcutta.<br />Maybe Mojo Nixon was right when he sang, \\"Elvis is Everywhere.\\"<br />When Elvis died in August 1977, Newsweek magazine ran three photos side-by-side: a teen daughter, a mother, and a grandmother, all mourning the death of the King.  Even when he died, Elvis' appeal crossed several generations.<br />Obviously, his appeal still goes on, even further than the conventional publicity machine in the music and movie industry.<br />My own personal feeling as to his enduring appeal is in his voice: I don't just recognize the emotion in his music, I actually feel it.  He threw so much of himself into his singing that you can't help but FEEL it yourself.  That's the connection and that's what lasts.<br />And that will never go out of style.
6303442846|5.0|Yes, as others are saying, this is a great film. The question is why hasn't it been released on DVD yet? 'Nough said.
B00005BCOL|5.0|This is a film that has withstood the test of time. It is every bit as entertaining, as when it was first first released back in 1939. The film is an outstanding example of pre-World War II opulence and elegance with its gorgeous art deco sets. Based upon a play by Claire Booth Luce, it boast a snappy and witty screenplay by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin. In the hands of legendary director, George Cukor, this film is sharp, funny, and memorable with stellar performances given by the entire cast. Boasting an all female ensemble, with nary a male in sight, the film revolves around men. How to get 'em. How to keep 'em. How to lose 'em. How to get 'em back.<br />The film details the marital travails of Mary Haines, played by screen great, Norma Shearer. Mary has a coterie of bitchy, gossipy, back biting friends, and included in that group is her cousin Sylvia, played with madcap zaniness by Rosalind Russell. Mary is happily married to wealthy Stephen Haines, or so she thinks. Apparently, her perfect husband is stepping out on her with perfume salesgirl, Crystal Allen, played with bad girl abandon by Joan Crawford, and it seems that all New York knows it.<br />Mary's so called friends ensure that Mary finds herself in a position to discover her husband's betrayal. Mary's mother, Mrs. Moorehead, played with characteristic stateliness and grace by Lucille Watson, counsels her daughter to handle the matter the old fashioned way, promising that the affair will soon burn itself out. She advises her daughter not to betray her feelings about the affair, not to mention it to her husband, not to discuss it among her friends, and to turn a blind eye to the whole matter.<br />Mary reluctanly tries to adhere to her mother's counsel, until a chance encounter with the now full of herself Crystal Allen causes Mary to lose control, and the fur begins to fly. Mary, now taking a more contemporary approach, totally disregards her mother's advice and refuses to overlook the affair or forgive her husband for the pain and humiliation he has caused her. Leaving him, the inevitable happens, but all's well that ends well.  The performances by this all star cast are to be lauded, as each and every one of those cast in this film contribute to making it a truly great film.<br />Norma Shearer is perfectly cast as the somewhat prim and proper Mary Haines. She plays her role with studied restraint, until the final shot in the film, when she crosses the line. While the fact that she was the widow of Irving Thalberg, a well respected studio head who had died about two years prior to the filming of this movie, may have contributed to her getting the lead, she certainly deserved it in her own right, as she had been a leading lady for many years (Romeo and Juliet, Marie Antoinette, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Private Lives, etc.) and a big star. Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford were actually real life rivals and had never much liked each other, so I am sure that playing rivals in this film was not a stretch. Joan Crawford is wonderful as the \\"man trap\\" who steals Mary's husband. She plays the role of Crystal as a hard edged girl from the wrong side of the tracks who grabs for the brass ring. Though she does not have all that many scenes in the film, her presence is such that the viewer does not immediately realize it.<br />Rosalind Russell, in her first comedic role is terrific. She had  previously done only dramatic roles and actually auditioned for the role of Sylvia, playing it three different ways. She played it straight. She played it with a light comedic touch. She played it with total, over the top, comedic abandon. When George Cukor selected her for the role, he told her that the third way was the way he wanted her to play it. At first, Ms. Russell balked, thinking that such comedic excess would be the end of her career. He convinced her that madcap zaniness was the way to go, and she complied, giving an over the top, zany performance that was an instant hit.This film kicked off her start as a comedic actress.<br />Kudos also go to Mary Boland, as Flora, the Countess DeLave (\\"l'amour, l'amour\\"), as well as to Paulette Goddard, as Miriam Aarons, the divorcee  who steals Sylvia's husband, and to Joan Fontaine, as the sweetly naive Peggy. Ms. Fontaine looks remarkably like her estranged sister, Olivia DeHaviland, in this film. Marjorie Main plays the role of Lucy, the crude, rough, no nonsence country woman. It is a role reminiscent of a young Ma Kettle, a role she would play in the 1947 film, \\"The Egg and I.\\" It would be a role that she would take to the bank, as it would spin off into a wildly popular series of \\"Ma and Pa Kettle\\" films for Universal Pictures.<br />Virginia Weidler is affecting as little Mary, the Haines' young daughter. Butterfly McQueen, of \\"Gone With The Wind\\" fame, has the small part of Lulu, the cosmetics counter maid. Keep your eye open for Hedda Hopper, the real life gossip columnist. Staying true to form, she plays the role of Dolly Dupuyster, a gossip columnist, who appears towards the very end of the film. Don't blink, or you'll miss her. The film is shot in black and white, though it has a fashion show segment that is shot entirely in color. The elegant and chic wardrobe for the cast is provided by the noted designer, Adrian.<br />This is a film that will be enjoyed by viewers who enjoy vintage films, as well as by those who simply love a great movie.

B00006AG5N|5.0|It's been too long, Elvis.  But you haven't disappointed us!  This is the first collection of all-new songs.  Three of them, at least, are destined to be successful on the charts--probably number ones.  <br />&quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; stands out as a bitter verbal bash directed toward the Americal penal system.  Ironically, it is softened by the acoustic harp that comes in toward the end of the song.<br />&quot;Kentucky Rain&quot; is conspicuously absent, but may be added in future editions, according to Pink, who also added, &quot;I can't stay on your morphine, 'cause it's makin' me itch.&quot;<br />The rest of the album takes the listener on a roller-coaster ride of emotion, from anger (as expounded on &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; which is Elvis' recent departure into the club world) to sadness (as in &quot;HoundDog&quot; which goes a little overboard with the french horn--obviously trying for the Wuthering Heights sound).<br />In conclusion, you don't need to eat any mushrooms to enjoy this modern work of art!

038541627X|5.0|First off, it's Asimov short stories, so how could it be less then wonderful? Admittedly, the title is a bit misleading, Asimov wrote so many short stories that no single volume could hold all of them. There is, as could be expected, some overlap: stories in this collection that are also in others. That said, this is one of the best collections I've encountered, and it included several stories I have not seen in any other edition.
B00003CWL6|5.0|first off- I think the title is great. It is ironic, it is compelling, it sounds like Academy Award material. Then there is the cast. I thought Thora Birch and Kevin Spacey were simply magnificent. They were in complete control of their roles and tagged each scene perfectly. They possesed the camera. Sure, Wes Bentley, Annete Benning and Chris Cooper really hit their marks- but again, Spacey and Brich stood out the most to me, personally. <BR>I must admit, the movie depressed me and brought me to tears at moments- I don't want to say why, becasue it would give away major plot lines. Honestly, I was not allowed to see this at first, and I now understand. This movie is one of the deepest, most perplexing and saddening storyies I have ever seen brought to the Silver Screen.  This movie deals with everything considered coming of age or teenager. And surprisingly, alot of this is partrayed best and most through Kevin Spacey's middle aged, mid-life crisis suffering character.<BR>Sure Thora Birch and her counter part played by Wes Bentley are teen enough. But hey, Kevin Spacey was everything rolled into one. And the thing with the Colonel, that was very teenager/coming of age/ deciding which path you must take-esque. <BR>I can really elate with some of the feelings portrayed in this film and I give it seven-stars. I very thoroughly enjoyed this true gem of cinematic excellence.
B000063UR1|2.0|I wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  The effects were incredibly good (except for those oscilliscope screens, what was up with that?!), especially considering the year it was made.  I also sympathised with the main character, Lowell, and his motivations.  I thought that the opening conflict between Freeman Lowell and the other crewmembers had real potential, unfortunately, the story was terrible.  It also didn't help that the science was all wrong, what with artificial gravity, nuclear explosions in space with no effect on nearby objects, nuclear devices about the size of a Foster's beer can, etc. etc.<br />The dialogue was passable, but to say that the story was flat would be an understatement.  There was no character development.  There was no plot development.  The one &quot;mystery&quot; of the whole movie was incredibly obvious and also scientifically incorrect (as was the solution) and Lowell's motivation was never investigated, explained or developed.<br />To those who would claim that this is the &quot;best science fiction movie ever&quot;  are you judging the movie by its message or its execution?

B00005YUNY|5.0|First off, only 5 stars!?!?!  Let me put down 100 out of 5 stars!<br />I have been elevated to a new level of musical appreciation and joy that I never thought possible before!<br />I have seen YES 11 times in the last four years, and their Symphonic Tour is no exception when I say there never has been such an amazing band!  When I learned that YES was coming out with a DVD release of one of their symphonic performances, I was it absolute ecstasy knowing I would have the opportunity to watch over and over and over again a concert during a tour which brought me tears when I saw them perform live.<br />First off, major kudos to Tom Brislin.  I have been one of the hugest fans of Wakeman since the 70's, but as much as I missed Rick on this (and other) tours, I thought that Brislin did a phenomenal job!<br />Jon, always the voice of an angel!<br />Steve, a master of guitar . . . although he does look a little bit stiff and too serious at times.<br />Chris, he is a monster on the bass!  I'm sure that when he walks into music stores, the bass guitars quiver with fear.  Rarely will you ever see someone rock a guitar like that Mr. Squire!<br />Alan, one of the most consistently perfect drummers ever!  He's not the fanciest of drummers (e.g. like Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater), but he is consistently, consistently perfect in what he does!  A buddy of mine is a professional drummer and he says the same thing!<br />I am reticent to mention a highlight about this dvd because *ALL* of it is beyond outstanding.  I have chills every time I watch it, it's that moving.  However, if I *had* to cite a highlight, I would have to say the drum section in &quot;Ritual.&quot;  One of my favorite all-time songs anyway, but they took this song to a whole new level!<br />If you're going to be stranded on a desert island and you have only one dvd, make it this one!<br />May YES continue to live healthily and happily and continue to bring pure joy to so many millions of fans!<br />Thank you, YES.

Unfortunately, we'll probably never hear this on the radio because this band is not mindless or [angry].  Actual guitar players and singer who sings, not screaming just for the sake of screaming.  Long Live Rock!
B00005B238|5.0|Out of all of Shwartzenegger's movies I think PREDATOR is the best.It has lots of action and suspense.The predator was cool.<BR>He had a arsenal of weaponry,super strength, infrared vision<BR>and he could become transparent.I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes thrilling movies.
B00006DEFA|4.0|This is a wonderful piece of eye candy for anyone who enjoyed Amadeus.  My only complaint, is that one brief but classic bit of footage was removed from the director's cut:  It was when Salieri was talking to God of &quot;ruin(ing) your incarnation...&quot; and his face twisted into pure bitterness as he looked upward, then he glanced at the priest, and broke into an inexplicably sweet face.  It was such a charater-enriching moment, that made me decide to keep my original, and treat this new set as a giant &quot;Extra&quot;.
6302816580|4.0|This movie is a classic. It is about a truck driving arm wrestler (played by Sylvester Stallone) who has never really been there for his family, mainly his son. His wife gets ill when the boy is around 12 and makes a dying wish for her son to get to know his father. But the rich father-in-law (which has taken care of the boy pretty much all of his life) won't give him up to his \\"bum\\" father. The struggle begins between father, son and father-in-law. This is a great father, son movie.

B00005K3NY|5.0|I see the reviews for this film are not glowing but I decided to sound off and say this film is tremendious. True at times it is a bit camp, and the dubbing of voices at times is bad, but the acting is timeless, the scenes are memoriable, and among Sci Fi horror films it rightfully established Cronenberg as the master of the genre. I can recommend this film as the perfect introduction to Cronenberg with his great films Videodrome(even stranger)and Dead Ringers.
B00006AUIG|3.0|I watched Session 9 last night before I went to bed. It was around 11:30, and I didn't turn off the set until after 1:00. <br />Big mistake.<br />I went to sleep on edge, feeling really weird, like all the dark shadows contained some sort of...I don't know.<br />And that's just it: I don't know.<br />I don't now what the antagonist was in Session 9. I don't know what the point of the movie was. I don't know what to make of the ending. Was it supernatural, like The Shining? Or was it merely psychological, like any guy-under-pressure-kills-people movie?<br />I don't know.<br />The asylum was way beyond creepy. It, alone, deserves the three stars I gave this movie. But the plot is weak, and the wrap-up was even weaker. More spookiness could have been wrung out of this movie if the writer/director had utilized the setting more effectly and shown flashbacks to when the asylum was in full use. Or shown ghosts. Or shown things moving in the asylum that weren't human. Or something.<br />I can't recommend Session 9 -- although I wish I could. It's a great idea. But it was flawed in its execution.
B000002KIE|4.0|This is the one that brought life back to rock `n roll, breathed new attitude into a stale music scene and launched a thousand bands. It must also be remembered that when this album was released, artists like Patti Smith, Richard Hell &amp; The Voidoids, Wayne/Jayne County, Television &amp; Talking Heads were creating great, and more enduring music on the New York scene. All of this contemporaneously with the hedonistic abandons of the disco scene. Those were interesting times. Twenty-five years later the many imitations and permutations have rendered punk just another branch of rock. But the excitement lives on in these rude anarchistic anthems like God Save The Queen and Pretty Vacant. It also includes their riveting debut single Anarchy In The UK and another hit Holidays In The Sun. I give it five stars for its influence and historical importance and three stars for listening pleasure.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This first Harry Potter film is among one of my favorites and the DVD itself is superb.  Any blockbuster movie in a widescreen DVD format along with lots of extras is perfect, trust me!  There's not much sense in me to review the movie, since you've all gotten enough of that.  What can I add?  Well, it's just that I am VERY happy this DVD purchase and I have not regret one bit.  It's one of those favorites that will remain in my collection for a long time.  Oh yes, there's is just one little complaint.  I was disappointed that the DVDs came in a box package.  I wish it came in a sturdier, plastic case, like the LOTR one.  Hehe :)
6305313687|5.0|American History X was such a powerful movie, I'm still reeling from its emotional, psychological, and personal impact.  This is one of the best handlings of the issue of racism I've ever seen.  Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek Vinyard definitely struck a nerve.  Rather than the usual caricature of racists as ignorant rednecks, Norton played Vinyard as a charismatic, intelligent skinhead sentenced to prison who returns to redeem himself by saving his brother.  The said brother (excellently played by Edward Furlong) comes off as an angry confused kid, desperate for an ideology that can give his life direction.<br />...
B00005NWM3|2.0|In 1970, 2 British groups, Led Zeppelin (in \\"LZ 2\\") and Deep Purple (in \\"In Rock\\") established the formula of hard rock. Since then hundrets of hard rock groups repeated the formula time and again, made it poor, primitive, moronic, limited, and boring. From time to time we had the chance to listen to something else (like Nirvana and few more from Seatle), but it was an ekseption. \\"How you remind me\\" had that fresh-promising sound which made me buy the CD. Bad mistake. 3 good starters and then - total boredom. You'd be amazed to know how easy it was to fall asleep after listening to that noisy boring hard rock group. Sleeping pill couldn't do better.
0393317552|4.0|In \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", the author presented many interesting notions on the fates of human societies. Yet, he appeared to be uninformed in a couple of centrally important facts. Guns and Steel were not European inventions. Aside from cast iron, steel swords and weapons were already existent in China in the first century A.D. (see Jacques Gernet's \\"A History of Chinese Civilization\\", for example) Firearms and cannons, not just gunpowder, were also invented and deployed in China in the eleventh century A.D. Both of which saw their usage against the Mongols during the 1200s A.D. In fact, Genghis Khan was mortally wounded by a cannon on one of his campaigns, thus leading to his premature death, which left the eventual completion of his quest for empire to his grandson. <br />But firearms and cannons were also adopted by the Mongols, who were the first to use these weapons in Europe during their invasions of Hungary, which probably resulted in the transfer of these technologies to Europe. So here's the interesting paradox: China had long possessed guns and steel, two of the things in the title of the book \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\" Yet, they did not set upon the course of history that Europe did starting in the 1500s. Despite the omissions of facts, the author was able to offer a general explanation for the broader divergence in historical trends. He pointed to the fact that political unity in China, as opposed to political disunity in Europe, many times stifled the continuation of development because the decree of a despot could completely halt critical junctures in development in China, but similar decrees would have far lesser effects in a fragmented Europe. This notion is refreshing, but appears to be lacking in depth, since the author did not mention whether steel and firearms production was stifled in this way. And here's my important point: if these critical technological advancements were not left to rust by a Chinese despot, then Mr. Diamond's explanation seems to be insufficient. And I believe a fuller explanation of this case would have to include cultural and social factors. I think it was a regrettable failure on Mr. Diamonds part to neglect examining the stifling characteristics of Confucian culture, which have been the primary factor in limiting the ambitions of that country and its people. <br />Another error, albeit a minor one, that I noticed was the author's reference to the \\"Greek\\" conquest of Persia and the Indus Valley in one of the last pages of the book. If he meant the exploits of Alexander the Great, then he should have known that Alexander was Macedonian, as were most of his armies. The distinction had already been well established in biographies and scholarships on the Macedonian king. At any rate, it would be no more justified to call the Macedonian conquests as Greek conquests than it would be to call the Mongol invasions of Europe as Chinese invasions.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I was very excited to finally watch this movie after hearing all the hype, I love these kind of movies. But sadly after watching it twice, I have to say this [was disappointing] ! The first round I didn't quite get the whole story so I actually sat through the whole thing again a second time. Well, I think I got the story all right.  Some areas were put together cleverly, the acting wasn't too bad, but the story itself is just terrible. Nothing exciting or original !! For those who compares this with Pulp Fiction or Memento, please don't ! Its nothing like them. The otheres were clever, this is plan stupid.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I love the Harry Potter Soundtrack.....and you will to.Especialy if you're a major Harry Potter fan like me(i've read the first 4 books 21 times each, but thats not the point).My favorite tracks are Hedwig's Theme , Harry's Wonderous World, Diagon Alley, and The Quidditch Match.
0920236162|5.0|Years ago in graduate school, I received this book as I was completing my studies in Workplace Diversity and thoroughly enjoyed it.  All these years later, I have just finished reading this to my 6 year old daughter, and appreciate the lesson of the book even more.  Regardless of your child's gender, this simple story about finding one's self esteem is terrific.
B00002E224|5.0|Before Sunrise is a love story. But forget that. Love stories have a bad name, in part because they're predictable, and in part because humans tend to look back on love the same way that someone looks back on a night of heavy drinking: with a bit of regret, a bit of dread, and a bit of a smirk.<br /><br />Before Sunrise, though, is one of the best movies ever made. I carry around with me my own list of top 10 best films of all time, and this one, along with its sequels, always vies for top honors.<br /><br />There's one thing, though, that all of the films on my list of &#34;best ever&#34; have in common: they transcend their ostensible subject matter. You can watch Before Sunrise, as many have, and say that it's a charming love story. But you won't remember it for that reason. You'll remember it because you'll watch it and then realize that you've seen something you didn't quite understand fully. You'll have to watch it again. And when you do, you'll see details that you missed the first time; you'll hear conversations again and be mystified; you'll watch train tracks rush by in the beginning and have to pause the film because you realize that they presage something significant that the movie is about.<br /><br />When you first see those train tracks rushing by, they seem to be a backdrop for the credits. And that they are. But in great films, as in great works of art, there are no gratuitous details. Those train tracks rushing by will come to represent the fleeting nature of human relationships, the urgency of seizing the moment, the speed at which life shifts direction (notice the shifting of train lanes).<br /><br />After a few pastoral scenes that set the stage, the next shot is out the back of the train, showing life already lived, fading fast. All of this becomes significant as the film progresses. You don't know this, of course, on first viewing. And in many films, you're never tempted or compelled to view the film again. But with this one, you are, and when you do, you'll pick up on these details. (It might take a few viewings, a few years.)<br /><br />One of the reasons that the movie always reasserts itself on my list of top films of all times is that it constantly intersperses exposition and symbolism, and it tells a story, and sends a message, through silence, without saying, or having the characters say, anything at all. The final scene is a case in point. What you see are a collection of locations largely void of people. Those locations, earlier in the film, were brought alive by the energy of the movie's two protagonists, Jessie and Celine. By showing the same locations at the end of the film without Jessie and Celine, filmmaker Richard Linklater articulates something almost ineffable. It has to do with the nature and the source of significance, the reminder that the energy of a place is dependent solely on those who provide the energy, and the sadness inherent in visiting places devoid of the people that once gave them meaning. It has to do with much more, as well, which is but one reason why the film is worth watching repeatedly--and will likely remain with you forever.<br /><br />Before Sunrise, from its title to its final credits, is a work of art--and a love story, by the way. Even better, it is the first of an unparalleled trilogy of films, the latter two of which I will get to later. For those who haven't seen it, or its sequels, how lucky you are.you do, you'll pick up on these details.

B00006G8G4|5.0|You can't go wrong if you are a Spidey fan.  This DVD set has it all!  The special features alone make it worth the price. The movie is an updated and condensed version of how he met the Green Goblin.  I hope there is a sequel.  William DeFoe plays the best villian yet.  They have to bring him back for the next one. I don't believe John Malcovitch would have been as good as the Green Goblin.  He was one of the first choices.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is an excellent movie, and is anything BUT recruitment propaganda (BTW, the movie's main characters are Airborne, Rangers, and Delta Force---the Army, not the Marines). This film captured the horror of urban warfare in much the same way Saving Private Ryan captured the D-Day invasion. War is not pretty, not glamourous, and is definitely nothing any sane person would want to partake in...
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is AMAZING! I wasn't really into her until I randomly bought her CD, Let Go, but I am so glad I did. This album perfetly reflects my life and my feelings, so it's music that I can relate to, and I think that's really important for an artist to consider. Some of the songs are (in my opinon) better than others, but they all hold meaning. My favorites are Losing Grip, Complicated, Sk8er Boi, Tomorrow, Things I'll Never Say, and Naked. Buy this CD and you will never regret it, guarenteed.
0783225849|5.0|I thought that this movie was exellent. It was perfectly directed and perfectly acted. After Anthony Perkins was in this, people never looked at him the same way. It is about a lady named Marion(Janet Leigh) who is supposed to deposit [a lot of money] into the bank. Instead, she steals the money un noticed, and drives to see her boyfriend Sam(John Gavin). After she has a long drive, she stops at the Bates Motel, and eats dinner with the owner, Norman(Anthony Perkins). After dinner, Marion deciedes to take a shower and the infamous shower scene occurs. After that, Norman cleans up the room, puts the dead body in the trunk(along with the $...), and sinks it into the swamp. Later, Lila(Vera Miles), Marion's sister, is worried about Marion since she is missing. So Dectective Arbogaust(Martin Balsam) offers to help Lila and Sam. When Arbogaust finally goes to the motel and asks Norman about information about Marion, Norman denies it. Later, Arbogaust sees someone inside the house. Then, Arbogaust goes into the Bates' Mansion and walks up the stairs when a dark figure comes out of the bedroom.....
B0000542D2|4.0|I really enjoyed the DVD.  My only knock is that it includes everyone but the Beatles in the Extras.  I would be interested in what they tought about the movie and that time in their career.
0780624890|5.0|Good action vampire stories, whether written, drawn or on film are just plain hard to find.  For a while now the 'not quite bad' vampire and even the 'good' vampire have been fashionable.  Not that I have anything against Angel or Henry Fitzroy and their ilk, but sometimes you want a story with a clear division between good and evil and a lot of knock them down and stake them action.  Enter Blade.<br />Blade is a half vampire with a very nasty attitude toward his relatives on the dark side.  Played by Wesley Snipes, he has all the moves and attitude you could ever want.  His partner in his war against the things that did in his mother is Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson).  Later, Karen (N'Bushe Wright) a forensic hematologist who has the bad luck to find a vampire on her table, joins them.  Opposing this team is Frost (Steven Dorff), a vampire rebel who thinks it is time for the un-people with pointy teeth to come out of the closet.  His plan is simple.  Take over the vampire council, capture Blade and resurrect La Magra - the blood god.  Then there will be nothing but vampires and bloodsicles.<br />'Blade' is an extremely violent film.  Almost everyone is a martial arts expert, has access to what the US Congress would consider weapons of mass destruction, or is a victim.  Sometimes, they are all three.  Toss in a sufficiency of special effects, great settings, and good acting and you have the film.  What makes 'Blade' work is its intense focus.  It works hard at being exactly what it is - an action film with a strong 'wow' factor.  Sometimes that is exactly what you need.<br />Steven Norrington, a director considerable experience in the horror/science fiction genre, has a great sense of what it takes to make comic book characters come to life on the screen.  He manages to retain the strong visual impact of the original Marvel Comics series.  David Goyer's script manages to capture the essence of comic book dialogue - sparse, but not stilted.  The overall effect is a film that builds smoothly from start to ending, with very few slow moments.<br />The extras on the DVD are surprisingly good.  Good sized features on the concepts and effects that went into the film, the story of the Blade comic, and an interesting survey of the vampire in human imagination.  In addition, there is an extensive running commentary for the film.  All of these are intelligently done.  I think 'Blade,' despite its violence, will appeal a wide range of viewers as something more than just another Hong Kong fight film wannabe.is a film that builds smoothly from start to ending, with very few slow moments.<br />The extras on the DVD are surprisingly good.

B00004U8H4|3.0|I am a Christian Bale fan but have never seen American Psycho. So, I bought the book, read it, loved it...... Then I bought the dvd. Christian Bale played Patrick Bateman exactly as I would have imagined. I am sure it was hard to fit the entire context of the book into a film, as the book uses a lot of narration, but it was done very well. My only suggestion is that everyone read the book first to understand the characters and their motivation. Without the prior knowledge of what the story is about, some of the scenes seem overacted although they really aren't.
0316921173|3.0|About 100 pages in I started to realize that this was science fiction -- sort of, anyway. In Wallace's crypto-dystopian future, the federal government is reduced to earning extra cash by \\"subsidizing\\" the calendar to various corporations so that the years are no longer designated by numbers, but by products (\\"The Year of the Whopper\\") whose images are placed, every January 1, at the end of the Statue of Liberty's arm where the torch used to be. Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and parts of Massachusetts and upstate New York are rendered uninhabitable by toxic waste and are therefore summarily \\"ceded\\" to Canada in what's referred to as \\"ecological gerrymandering.\\" Subsequently huge metal ballistic waste containers are hurled into space and literally \\"thrown\\" into this area, called the Concavity, now North America's hugest landfill. All of this we glean by inference rather than by direct information, until, 350 pages later, we learn the details of this great North American restructuring in the description of a low-budget puppet show shot on video by the main character's developmentally-disabled brother.<br />This is a huge heavy daunting book, physically and intellectually demanding. Forget about reading it on the subway. Wallace loves to write, and hates to edit, apparently; he also wants to make sure you know you're reading an Important Work by making it a job simply to pick it up. He's one of those contemporary novelists who employs copious notes, some informational and some which simply continue the story as if within parentheses. This is fine, except that Wallace has chosen to use endnotes instead of footnotes, which sends you flopping over to page 1000 every few minutes to find the next note, some of which are formidable -- note 110, for example, is almost twenty pages of 6-point type and has twelve of its OWN endnotes. Note 123 includes several complicated mathematical diagrams. Some notes merely refer you to other notes.<br />The plot, such as it is, involves a short film that is so fulfilling, so pleasurable, that anyone who even glimpses a moment of it is instantly rendered catatonic, unable or unwilling to do anything but watch the film over and over forever, incommunicative except for insistent pleas for just a few moments, even just a trailer or a teaser, of the Entertainment. The US government wants to get its hands on this film that it knows no American will be able to resist. A Quebecois separatist group, the Wheelchair Assassins, wants to acquire the film and assess its possible utility as a terrorist weapon. But if you're the kind of reader who likes stories to have endings, let me go ahead and ruin this one for you right now: this plot is never resolved and you will never learn what happens to any of the characters involved in finding or in making it.<br />The book will be more enjoyable if you focus on its two main settings: The upscale tennis academy and the deliciously dysfunctional family that runs it; and the substance-abuse recovery halfway house at the bottom of the hill, which is filled to the brim with vivid and arresting character portraits including the staid and somber Don Gately, the most likable character ever to addict himself to Dilaudid.short film that is so fulfilling, so pleasurable, that anyone who even glimpses a moment of it is instantly rendered catatonic, unable or unwilling to do anything but watch the film over and over forever, incommunicative except for insistent pleas for just a few moments, even just a trailer or a teaser, of the Entertainment.

B000002H38|5.0|What can I say, I've got to agree with the other reviewers, this album is an absolute classic. I have all of her other albums, (well, except for Rhythm of Love), and they are all nice, but there is something about this one--I always grab this CD first before I listen to her others. The songs are timeless--20 years from now you can still play &quot;Rapture&quot; or &quot;Sweet Love&quot; and enjoy it just as much, maybe even more than before. &quot;Rapture&quot; is perfect for any mood: taking a road trip, going to work, and especially winding down at the end of the day by yourself or your significant other. This truly is a must-have for any lover of R&amp;B/Soul music.
B000062Y98|5.0|This album is excellent...very very very excellent. My first BG album was Nightfall In Middle Earth, and I thought it couldn't get any better than that. This album matches and maybe even surpasses N.I.M.E. True the guitars are a bit quiet, but you can hear them nicely. The drumming is awesome on this album. Hansi Kursch- absolutely amazing. I love his voice on this album. True this album shares the same name as a Queen album, but Blind Gaurdian is better than Queen! So I don't really care. This album is just down right amazing, so stop reading and buy it!...
0780624890|5.0|In the time since Blade released(4 years)no other comic movie has managed to surpass it in action, story, or direction. No. Not even the incredible Spider-Man. In fact, the only other superhero film to best it would be Superman: the movie.<br />Since there have been so many reviews on the film itself, I'll stick to commenting on the extras. First up: a commentary by the producer/star, writer, star, and I believe editor, I may be wrong, so please forgive any error. It's a very fact filled commentary, and very interesting. You'll surely dig this one. Next, is a few liitle documentarys on vampires and the fights, even one on some of the effects. Very cool stuff. Finally, there's a trailer and various trinkets.<br />For a Dvd that's four years old, this is stacked and nowadays, you can get this [very inexpensively], so, I suggest you do just that.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|The mix of martial arts and horror is outstanding. This is a very well made film with few flaws. The acting is stand out as well. <BR>Now to the flaws. The first is the occasional bad cgi. Especially during the fight between Blade and Neesa(sp?). It slips back in later, but is not half as bad as that mentioned scene.<BR>The DVD itself is flawless. Quite possibly the best picture and sound available on DVD. The extras are good as well. The pact of blood doc. is very nice. There's an assortment of trailers and featurettes also on the disk. <BR>All in all, this is a great DVD and is well worth the money. The only thing that could make this better would be if Paulina Rubio came with it.
0792833686|5.0|Singin' in the Rain is considered by many (including myself) to be the best musical ever made.  A pleasure from start to finish, it is actually more than a great musical...it is a great movie.  Small wonder it ranks on the AFI list of best movies as number 10 and also finishes in the AFI top twenty for comedies and romances.<br />Is it a perfect movie?  Well, that may be saying too much, but I can't think of a single flaw.  Even the Broadway Melody/Gotta Dance sequence which I used to think was overly long as a kid now seems as great as the rest of the movie.  But my single favorite scene (and I doubt I'm far from alone here) is Gene Kelly dancing and singing the title song.<br />I don't want to overly hype the movie and create unrealistic expectations, but I do think this can be enjoyed by almost anyone; although fifty years old, it is still as fresh as anything made today.
B00005JL3A|3.0|The first time around, the movie was good. The second time, the movie was still good, but the flaws were very noticable. The utmost of those flaws directly involves Anderson and Milla. He is too busy attempting to steal every Hitchcock trick in the book, while Milla walks around looking pretty but acting very vapid. She shows off her wonderful body a few times, so I don't fault her for not doing much.    The DVD quality is spectacular. The picture is amongst the best of any DVD--and the DD 5.1 sound is better than it was in theaters. Unfortunately that spectacularity does not extend to the special features. No, what you get is: some lame trailers; some even lamer behind the scenes footage (Milla is fine as hell, so just be sure to use the pause button frequently); and you get the worst commentary in years.    The commentary of doom!    It is packed with people: Director Anderson, Producer Bolt, Actresses Milla and Michelle. But the problem here is Milla, only Milla. Apparently she never learned what a commentary is, and is shocked when it is explained to her (\\"you mean we talk for the whole movie?\\"). Anderson and Bolt make numerous attempts to describe the set-up to a shot, or any number of other technical matters, but Milla won't have it. All she does is joke around, really bad jokes, and interrupt anyone who talks. She makes fun of the movie, bashes her male co-star repeatedly for something SHE did, and generally acts a fool. It is really sad. She may not be the best actress, but most people assumed she was intelligent: European woman, speaks multiple languages... But she plainly shows us the woman underneath the beauty. Milla is a moron. Too bad.    The movie: 7/10  Picture quality: 9/10  Sound quality: 9/10  Extras: 2/10

B00005AQE8|5.0|This album throws out some of the most wickedest beats.  My opinion, he's is definately one of the \\"Generals\\" of the game.  He still lives on in his music and continues to influence others that are in the game and those that are not.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic by Harper Lee. The book narrates the story of a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, also called Scout. Lee presented this book through the eyes of Jean Louise. <BR> The story takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s or so. The plot is about Scouts father, Atticus Finch (a lawyer), trying to defend Black suspect Tom Robinson for accused of raping a White girl in the Maycomb County of Alabama. The plot incorporates several issues that people were struggling during the time of the story, including racism, injustice, and prejudice. The entire novel circulates around Scout and her family. Many situational conflicts arise, from trying to make Boo Radley come out of seclusion to dealing with family and community difficulties. <BR> Lee did a miraculous job of telling the story through the view of Scout. The characters were depicted hardly by their appearances, but by their personality traits, which showed advanced style in writing. The setting and the time periods had a great impact on the story, as people those days lived quite close to each other and knew their neighbors well. I was amazed how natural and realistic the characters were made. Scout and her older brother, Jeremy (also called Jem), reacted to situations exactly as many of the children now days would act. Almost every character in the story had a crucial role at some point of the story. The character development was beyond imagination. From Dill (Jem and Scouts best friend) coming to visit the Finch family in the summer, to Jem trying to make it past the Radleys gate, to Calpurnia (the house cook) scolding the children for not coming home, this piece of literature truly elaborated on pivotal character details. After reading this book, one would think he knows the characters quite well. <BR> Overall, this was a fantastic novel to read and I was truly impressed with the quality of writing and development presented in this story by Harper Lee. To Kill a Mockingbird will truly be an American Literature classic for as long as it will be remembered.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Some people dislike this movie because they don't understand it, and some just flat out don't like it. To each their own.<br />You have to admit that the beginning of this movie is like being high, or something--a guy falls through the ceiling, everything is kind of dizzyingly bright and everybody is a little bit on the psychotic side, if I remember correctly. But I have a tendency to be amused by these kinds of things, and besides, it was interesting. After awhile this movie gets a bit darker, and it's still somewhat chaotic in nature until the end, but I found it highly entertaining.
B000001FCB|5.0|This album is a great treat, and if you haven't heard it yet you will enjoy it so much.  It contains the definitive version of &quot;Waters of March&quot;, possibly my favorite song.  The contrast between Elis' smoky, incredible voice and Jobim's playing... it's a true classic.
0517201658|5.0|There are several books that stand out in my mind: Lonesome Dove, Gone with the Wind, The Rise of T. Roosevelt, and The Thorn Birds. I became interested in this novel after watching the mini-series. Now they really do not make mini-series like that anymore. I loved Rachel Ward (although she's not that great an actress) and Mancini's music (famous for also writing the Pink Panther and MoonRiver songs). <br />Read the book. If you don't like romance novels... we'll this novel isn't just about the &quot;girl&quot; and the priest.
0743518144|5.0|I listened to the audio CD's.  Thank you Marcus Buckingham, Donald O. Clifton and the Gallup Organization for this collaborative gem!  It presents strong material in an understandable format by a strong narrator.  I would N-E-V-E-R use the term \\"mediocre\\" as one recent reviewer.  The ideas presented here can help you make a real breakthrough to higher achievement and fulfillment in all your endeavors.  The authors have taken a very complex topic and have refined it down to a predictable level to offer a very practical and useable approach for the layperson.  Five Stars? I'd say more like 500 stars.  If you are searching for a way to take stock of yourself and put it all together for a compelling and worthwhile future, then buy this item now.  Don't put it off.  ONE REGRET!  I only regret that I have passed over this CD set on shelf of my local bookstore for two years before finally buying.
B0000542D2|2.0|Still a great movie. That fact has been established already, no need to address that here.<br />I liked the George Martin interview...interesting! The extras on the disc get quite monotonous. They might as well interviewed the janitor who cleaned up Lennon's puke.....all kidding aside...Miramax was really scraping up interviews to make this a 2 cd affair.<br />Other reviews have nailed this recent package well. Like where is the &quot;Running, Jumping, Standing Still&quot; movie and the Beatle numbers not included in the actual film.<br />The sound leaves something to be desired. I prefer my original Hard Day's Night dvd when the sound was in 2.0 not the 5.1 surround. Believe it or not the 2.0 sounded much better than this new mix of 5.1!<BR>I didn't know they filmed this movie in widescreen...my original dvd version is not in widescreen. <BR>All in all this new packaging and audio mix leaves ALOT to be desired and is not a be all end all statement to a classic like A Hard Day's Night.
B00006AW2F|4.0|From what I've read in the past, I've always understood this odd album to be a [take]-off that was released (originally in '74, I think) by the Stones' old label in order to make some quick cash.  So you can imagine my surprise when I listened to it for the first time last week and started to fully understand just what I was hearing.  The most obvious comparison I can think of is to The Beatles' \\"Anthology\\" series from a few years back; i.e.: these songs are studio \\"rejects\\" that never made it onto officially-released albums for one reason or another.  So, for the hardcore Stones fan, this album is an absolute must.  And the songs themselves range from \\"so-bad-they're-almost-good\\" (\\"Each and Every Day of the Year\\") to \\"interesting\\" (\\"Walking Thru the Sleepy City\\", \\"Memo from Turner\\") to \\"pretty-freaking-awesome\\" (\\"Try a Little Harder\\", \\"I Don't Know Why\\", \\"We're Wasting Time\\", \\"If You Let Me\\"). Do not hesitate to take a chance on this CD -- I'm sure glad I did.
B00006GFAB|1.0|If you have been orbiting the earth for 30 years and have finally made it back to the planet and didn't know a thing about what's happened in the last 30 years of music then you might want this as an intro to KISS.<br />Fortunatley most of us haven't...we've already heard these tunes and have paid for them a bunch of times over on various KISS CDs.<br />I dont like the cover! I think they did this same cover idea on DYNASTY. I liked that picture better.<br />This cd is oozing greed out of every digital pore!
B000068TPN|1.0|This movie was horrible,don't get me wrong i like my war films, and I am not the son of the devil, I found The Thin Red Line horrific, but this film had me in stitches, I was laughing so much and this made me feel very guilty. You know when someone is going to die, because something good has just happened to them. This film tries at one point to show the story not just from the americans side, but our hero from the other side runs along in dramatic slow motion only to have his head blown off. Mel Gibson just seemed to be his usual self, with no emotion this time, I didn't care what happened to these characters which since it is a true story made me feel more guilty. Watch Black Hawk Down, there's a very emotional war film.
0316548189|5.0|LONG WALK TO FREEDOM by Nelson Rolihlahla MANDELA (b. 1918) is one of the most fascinating and inspiring books that I have read.  This book is an autobiography of a recipient of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Peace, presidentent of the African National Congress, and head of the antiapartheid movement in the nation of South Africa.  He was convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964.  After 27 years at Robbens Island, a maximum security prison, he was released and then, played a leading role in developing a constitution for South Africa.  His greatest triumph occurred in 1994 when South Africa held its first-ever multiracial eletions.<br />LONG WALK TO FREEDOM spans nearly an entire century. Mr Mandela starts with his birth on the eighteenth of July, 1918, at Mvezo, a tiny village on the banks of the Mbashe River in the district of Umtata, the capital of the Transkei, itself eight hundred miles east of Cape Town and five hundred fity miles south of Johannesburg.  He chronicles his political awakening, his role in the ANC, three decades of prison and his triumphant release with the climatic elections of 1994.  With all the history that is covered in this book, it may be a long walk, even so, it is at a very brisk pace.<br />LONG WALK TO FREEDOM is more than a history of South Africa.  It is the story which is the life of a man.  Mr Mandela writes about the friends and foes of his life.  Nothing brings home the price that he paid more than the pain he endured at not being able to be with his family and loved ones.  Mr Mandela wrote, &quot;To be the father of a nation is a great honour, but to be the father of a family is a greater joy.  But it was a joy I had far too little of.&quot;<br />Mr Mandela's resiliency during his prison life is one of the most compelling aspects of this book for me.   He was able to meet the challenge presented to every prioner, particularly for every political prisoner, to survive prison intact; to emerge from prison undiminshed, to conserve and even replenish one's beliefs.   He was able to look back on his three decades at Robbens Island and contemplate the changes that occurred in his country, &quot;I always knew that deep down in every human heart, there is mercy and generosity,..for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.  Man's goodness is a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.&quot;<br />If you are interested in the history of South Africa or in the life of one of its greatest leaders, this book will be interesting to you.
B00005JKL8|1.0|This is also known as Owen Wilson Running. I respect all the actors in this film which makes it harder to tell teh truth about this film, No wait.....it isn't this film is just plain horrible. It tries to re-create the gritsy look of Three Kings but fails miserably in the fact that this is an action movie with no suspense or memorable bits of action. The acting is mediocre at best, apart from Wilson who has no time to act. The ending is just hilarious and manages to spoof itself. Oh well what did I expect?
B000000HTL|4.0|This is not the first Van Der Graaf Generator album you should buy. That would be World Record, which is probably their most accessible album. Once you've listened to that (and hopefully liked it), pick up Pawn Hearts (which is generally considered their masterpiece) and then come here. H to He Who Am The Only One is difficult to get into, except for the brilliant opening track Killer, which is perhaps my favourite Van der Graaf song ever. Its about a killer fish, of all things.<BR>The other tracks slowly grow on you. They contain some of Peter Hammil's best lyrics and some great music. Its not as complex as other progressive rock bands, but Van der Graaf generator is a tight band that stretches its capabilities.<br />My second favourite song is Pioneers Over C. because I love space epics. Emperor in his War Room has Robert Fripp as a guest guitarist but he doesn't turn in an overly impressive performance. Still, its a pretty good song as are House with No Door and Lost.
B00005JL9B|5.0|Being from the UK I first saw this film ages ago and it is absolutely amazing. Get it on Import no matter what. Being the same age as the children in the film I was able to relate to these characters. It is one of the most emotional films i've ever encountered. Performances are superb, as are the killing scenes. This film is not as violent as everyone makes it out to be. Try and get the 2 disc Special Edition. The film centers around 40 school students being forced to kill each other on a deserted island til only one remains, and their relationships with each other. I never get bored of this film and doubt I ever will. Some scenes are pure horror while otrhers are scenes of beauty.
1563898586|5.0|I knew they would never be a sequel to Alan Moore's classic comic series &quot;The Watchmen&quot; (and I wish Frank Miller had let well enough alone with &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;), but certainly &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; is a kindred spirit in key regards.  If the Watchmen were supposed to be superheroes that we recognized, even though we had never seen them before, then the League offers up recognizable fictional characters that we have never seen together before.  Going back a century for inspiration, Moore creates a Pax Britannia circa 1898 where the &quot;superheroes&quot; are fictional characters who had been created by that particular point in time, to wit: Mina Murray (Harker) from Bram Stoker's &quot;Dracula,&quot; Captain Nemo from Jules Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues Beneath the Sea,&quot; Alan Quartermain from H. Rider Haggard's &quot;King Solomon's Mines,&quot; and the titular characters of Robert Louis Stevenson's &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; and H. G. Wells' &quot;The Invisible Man.&quot;  There is also reason to believe that &quot;M,&quot; the shadowy figure who orders the League about, might in fact be Mycroft Holmes (and if you do not know what literary series he is from then just totally forget about enjoying this series).<br />If that, in and of itself, is not enough of a hook to get your interested in checking out this collection of the first comic book adventure of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen let me remind you that Alan Moore is doing the writing.  The artwork by Kevin O'Neill is certainly evocative of the turn of the last century, or, more to the point, does not look like a contemporary superhero comic book.  Moore and O'Neill also maintain a wonderful conceit throughout the series of presenting the comics as being published at the time of the story, filled with wonderful &quot;ads&quot; that are often as interesting as the story (one of which actually required the initial print run of one of the issues to be destroyed, a story you will have to find related elsewhere, patient reader).<br />Moore's intention was to deal with a superhero group before all the clich&eacute;s were established (again, similar to how &quot;The Watchmen&quot; was in a different reality unencumbered by the DC and Marvel universes).  Seeing an obvious parallel between the Hulk and Jekyll/Hyde, Moore let his imagination roam in his alternate, technically more advanced version of Victorian London.  The more you know about literary history from this period (e.g., Emile Zola's Nana is killed in the Rue Morgue by Hyde), the more you will enjoy all this work.  But this first adventure for the League still works if late 19th-century fiction is not your forte.  British Intelligence has discovered that cavorite, a material that makes flying machines possible, has been stolen by a mysterious Chinese figure (Oh, come on, take a wild guess who it has to be).  Campion Bond of MI5 has been ordered to assemble a team of adventurers to retrieve the cavorite, which is crucial to the race to get to the Moon.<br />&quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; is really much more fun than we usually associate with Moore's work.  Certainly his tongue has never been further in his cheeks than with this series.  The first three issues of Volume 2 have seen the light of day so far this year and if you read through this original endeavor you can quickly get up to speed with the current adventure.  Just remember it is 1898 and Britannia waives the rules...e issues to be destroyed, a story you will have to find related elsewhere, patient reader).<br />Moore's intention was to deal with a superhero group before all the clichés were established (again, similar to how &quot;The Watchmen&quot; was in a different reality unencumbered by the DC and Marvel universes).

B00005JKBC|3.0|My title comes from the fact that I made the mistake of seeing this film on a Friday night with some mates. This certainly is not an action packed thrill ride, but rather an intelligent look into the world of a spy and also friendship. A very talky film such as The Insider, can make this an effort to watch, but have no fear, you shall be rewarded with strong performances and some real time to think. The editing is fast paced and ofetn confusing but you soon get the grip of it all. Only watch if you have an attention span.
B00005OWEG|3.0|\\"Apocalypse Now\\" (1979) is about a U.S. solider on a mission to journey up river in a navy patrol boat and assassinate an army colonel who has gone insane and has isolated himself with a band of natives.<br />\\"Apocalypse Now: Redux\\" (2001) is about a U.S. solider on a mission and the adventures that happen on the way. <br />When I watched Apocalypse Now for the first time it absolutley blew me away. Apocalypse Now is still one of my all time favorite movies. Apocalypse Now: Redux did not blow me away. It nearly made me fall asleep. The main problem is the two big scenes added into the film. The first being a second Playboy bunny scene where Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) agrees to exchange sexual favors for fuel. The second being a scene at a French rubber plantation where Captain Willard and the crew have dinner with a French family who have been living there for years. These scenes really slow down the movie and are not necessary to the overly flow of the film.<br />Another problem is the characters. In the original version Captain Willard really seems like a man who determined to get where he needs to be and he's not gonna let anything stop him. In Redux there are scenes with him joking around with the crew. This really takes away from the character. Not making him the intense solider who won't let anything stand in his way. But just one of the boys.<br />In the original Col. Bill Kilgore (Robert Duvall) is a completely intimidating and insane U.S. colonel. In Redux he's a lot more goofy. In fact bordering on ridiculous. <br />Aside from the new scenes added there are a couple other differences in the original version. The first being the f'n tiger scene. In the original Chef (Frederick Forrest) is writing a letter to his wife back home. He then says he's gonna go get some mangos. Captain Willard tells him not to go in there (the forest) alone unless he knows the territory. Chef then gets up and leaves anyway and Willard follows. In Redux there's a scene where the crew steals Kilgore's surfboard. The crew is then in the boat by the forest and Kilgore (unseen) fly's over in a helicopter and begs for his board back. Chef then says he's gonna go get some mangos and The Chief says \\"have someone go with you\\" and Willard volunteers to go.<br />Another difference is. The \\"Satisfaction\\" water skiing scene happens much later in the film.<br />Apocalypse Now is one of the greatest films ever made. And in my opinion is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. Apocalypse Now Redux is essential viewing at least once for fans of the original. But if you've never seen either one. Watch the original first.
0790729709|5.0|Obviously I'm going to say that seeing as this is the movie that made me a Whitney Houston fan, though. However, it is a fun movie! Predictable, but definitely worth watching if only to see how Whitney Houston's &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack became the &quot;Thriller&quot; of the 90s.
B000069CWE|4.0|In my opinion, the hip-hop influence on 'Reanimation' is not the kind of hip-hop that \\"urban\\" [code word] audiences are drawn to -- this hip-hop is more of the underground/college radio variety: songs like \\"Enth E End\\" and \\"H! Vltg3\\" are textbook examples (think: Jurassic 5). In other words, as much as some people want to call this a \\"hip-hop\\" or rap album, I don't see BET playing any of the 'Reanimation' videos anytime soon. After having said all that, I think the 'Reanimation' album is a strong \\"B+\\" overall with some serious \\"A\\" (even \\"A+\\") material. I'll elaborate on my top five below:<br />\\"Pts.Of.Athrty\\" [track 2] is a supercharged rock track that perfectly intergrates turntable scratches to accentuate the beat. \\"P5hng Me A*wy\\" [track 6] is a straight-forward rock track that has an Alice In Chains (circa 1994) vibe, which I like a lot; if this isn't a single, it should be in my opinion. \\"My Dsmbr\\" [track 15] is a well done remix that sounds very 'digital', slick, and sophisticated.<br />\\"1stp Klosr\\" [track 19] is by far the *strongest* remix from the 'Reanimation' album, and serves up a ridiculous amount of hyper-adrenalized intensity, and satisfyingly unbridled rage. \\"Krwlng\\" [track 20] is a song that is alluded to throughout the whole album in the form of interludes, and makes for the perfect finale. 'Reanimation' is a great listen if you have a) open ears, and b) an open mind. If you like music by N*E*R*D (\\"Rock Star\\", \\"Lapdance\\") or enjoyed some of the Beastie Boys' material (after the 'Paul's Boutique' album) then I'd say this 'Reanimation' is a safe buy for you.<br />Thanks for reading!
B00003CXI1|5.0|At first, I initially had my doubts and reservations about this film.  Mostly because I didn't understand the hype or the craze that was Harry Potter, I thought it was just another stupid fad, like Pokemon or something.  When I heard about the film, I almost went nuts, because I thought this was getting out of control.  But then, I watched the interviews with the cast, and I thought to myself 'Hmmm, maybe I should give this film a chance, and check it out.'  Being that I had never read the books, I went into this film completely fresh, without any expectations whatsoever.  And boy I was NOT disappointed at all with this film.  Everything about this film was great, the storyline, the acting, and the special fx.  everything was just on point, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film.  Daniel Radcliffe is the perfect Harry Potter, I couldn't possibly picture anyone else in that role.  The DVD extras are wonderful, and I'm looking forward to the next film 'Chamber of Secrets'.  This is definitely a film for the whole family.
B00005JKNF|1.0|I have seen many movies over my lifetime.  Yet this movie takes the cake as being one if not the worst movie I have ever bothered to see.  I give it credit for being historically accurate, but then again so is the history channel.  So if you want historically accurate watch that and if you want a plot that you can understand do not watch Gosford Park.
B00006CXSS|4.0|I watched this one a while back and was very impressed with the level of detail and just about everything else in this production. Band of Brothers follows the lives of a group of young men from just before D Day through the end of the war and really doesn't hold anything back. Everything is shown in detail, must've cost a medium sized fortune to achieve that. Often we are taken along as though we are actually there on the battlefield, or at least a newscameraman was, no details left out including bloody wounds and exploding buildings from artillery fire. I'd reccommend this program to just about anyone with an interest in history or warfare.
B00005ATZT|5.0|&quot;The Fugitive&quot; is one of the best 90's movies ever made! Harrison Ford stars as Doctor Richard Kimble, a surgeon from Chicago, who was falsely convicted for killing his wife, must find a one-armed man whlie avoiding Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard played by Tommy Lee Jones who deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The Special Edition DVD is amazing. The picture and sound quality are fantastic. The extras are great including the Behind-The-Scenes Documentaries and the trailer. An excellent film!
0517189542|5.0|Little Women is a charming book for all ages old and young.  It has been cherished in our libraries for so many years and it never gets old.  The story is one of four sisters battling not only with perosnal issues but family issues.  The March family is not exaclty wealthy and they must find their money is places they wish not to.  But despite their financial issues the sisters make believe they live in other places, putting on theatricals, plays, making up clubs and tellong their most apauling secrets.  With their father in the Civil War and their mother having the reputation of helping a young black girl, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy must search for ways to fit in.  The book tells their story from when they are young girls in the Pickwick Portfoliio, to young women getting married and having a family of their own.<BR>    I can relate to this book a lot because having sisters of my own I went and still go through a lot of the same things.  When my sisters and I were little girls we played with eachother and made up games together much like the March sisters.  And as we a growing older we find that life is not always as simple as when we were kids, like Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy all find out together.  The book captures the essence and wonderful things to come when you have a sister that you love and care for and can tell all your secrets to.  When you doubt yourself your sister will back you up and love you no matter what.  There is nothing like a sister and to quote the book, \\" a sister's bond is one which that is stronger than marriage\\".
B00006IUOZ|5.0|This movie blew me away. Pacino was wonderful. Robin Williams made a great psychological killer. The scenes from Nightmute, Alaska made me want to pack up and move immediately!
B00006J3WH|3.0|When the Buffy website asked for votes on whether the soundtrack to the landmark episode \\"Once More With Feeling\\" should be released as a CD, I voted no because I didn't think the songs would hold up well enough apart from the visual to justify it.  Of course, I also knew damn well that I'd go and buy it anyway.<br />I suspect these songs are too specific to the plot of the episode to interest the casual fan.  In \\"Once More With Feeling,\\" Broadway musical veteran Hinton Battle plays a demon who makes people sing and dance themselves to death (\\"I can bring whole cities to ruin and still have time to get a soft shoe in,\\" from \\"What You Feel\\").  This is bad news for the Buffster, who was at the time pretty bummed about having been pulled from heaven by her well-meaning friends only to face hell on earth again in Sunnydale, CA.  Since Season Seven promises a shinier, happier Buffy, people buying this CD and tuning in to the show might be confused.<br />I almost gave this 2 stars and risked the wrath and unhelpful votes of fellow fans who have completely lost their objectivity.  But here are some reasons for the third star.  Emma Caulfield, Anthony Stewart Head, and sweet Amber Benson really can sing (\\"Under Your Spell\\" could more than hold its own at any Lilith Fair).  James Marsters, as usual, is just cool (or cold, as evidenced in his solo \\"Rest In Peace\\").  Also, in the \\"Suites\\" from other episodes \\"Hush\\" (I was expecting this to be just silence) and \\"Restless,\\" we get timely Halloween mood music as a bonus.<br />Of course, those of us who are of the fanatical understand and forgive any and all of the above problems.  But as I'm writing this Amazon ranks this disc at an amazing Number 8.  Someone out there is gonna be disappointed that lovely Alyson Hannigan is limited to one minor line in one song, and that Nicholas Brendon really can't sing too well.  Especially since they're both pictured prominently on the CD cover.<BR>  <br />As for the Goddess/Diva herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar (Prinze, Jr.), our Buffy:  it's apparent that she's not a professional singer, but she carries her 3 songs (\\"Going Through The Motions,\\" \\"Walk Through The Fire,\\" and \\"Something To Sing About,\\" by sheer force of personality.  I think everything she does is wonderful, so for space considerations I'll just say: (insert drool here).<br />Cross-marketing note:  some Buffy cast members (including Hannigan and Benson) also sing on Anthony Head's CD with George Sarah, \\"Music For Elevators.\\"  It's interesting, and also available through Amazon.com.
B00004Z459|5.0|...then one day sometime in 2000, the linkin park song one step closer started on the radio for one of the first times. i had just had a really bad argument w/ my parents and i was very upset. but then, when i heard that song, i realized that i could totally relate to the lyrics. i bought the cd hybrid theory the day it came out, and i still love it. i never get sick of listening to it. i listened to it whenever i am upset and it really made me feel better. i somehow got through my depression that way. i dealt with my problems but i still love linkin park and they have been my favorite band ever since. i dont mean to sound like a tv commercial or anything and im not saying linkin park can solve mental problems, but maybe it's because of them that i'm still living.
1587990717|1.0|This book is like a carton full of plastic peanuts. You search through the peanuts to find something of value and are ultimately disappointed. If you are not interested in an author-centered, name dropping. personal history , don't buy this book.
B000069CWE|5.0|i have been a huge fan of linkin park for a while now and i loved hybrid theory. hybrid theory, though, is more about the lyrics and has more of a rock flavor with rap. reanimation puts more emphasis on the music and is a hip hop rap cd, not rock. they are very different. so i guess it really depends on your mood when deciding which one is better. if you like rock better, then buy hybrid theory, but if you like party music, then try reanimation. or if you are a really big fan of linkin park (like me)and dont care either way, then get both.
B00005ASGI|5.0|Two of Star Trek's second season episodes that are quite memorable appear on the Volume 23 of this DVD collection.  One tackles a huge issue of the 60's while the other is just a classic Star Trek episode.  <br />A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR obviously attacks the Vietnam War issue that plagued the world at the time (the late 60's).  This had been attempted to a lesser extent in the earlier episode FRIDAY'S CHILD.  However A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR is far more successful at getting the message across.  Kirk and McCoy arrive at a peaceful primitive planet which Kirk had visited years earlier.  However upon their arrival they find the planet has been divided and they're using flintlocks.  As it turns out the Klingons have been supplying villagers with weapons to kill tribesmen.  One of these tribesmen is Tyree a good friend of Kirk's from years earlier.  As Kirk tries to help he realizes that he is violating the prime directive.  And in the end the peaceful Tyree even falls into the hatred and bloodshed when his manipulative wife Nona is murdered by villagers.  This episode ends on a real down note.  For it is extremely tragic what happens to this peaceful planet because of the Federation and Klingons.  It really relates to the Vietnam war when you think about it.  This episode is one of the more serious Star Trek outings however the Mugatu ape beast is somewhat cheesy looking and so this episode does have a few funny moments.  There is a great lesson to be learned from A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR but it's never been a personal favourite of mine.  It is a good episode though.  <br />The other one here is the classic GAMESTERS OF TRISKELION.  I am greatly suprised at the amount of negative reviews for this episode however.  I always found this to be one of Star Trek's finest and a true classic.  Kirk, Chekov, and Uhura are abducted by superior beings and forced to fight \\"drill thralls\\" in a gladiator like fashion.  The superior beings (known as the Providers) end up being talking brains that bid over these gladiator battles.  This episode has tons of colourful characters including a beautiful green haired humanoid named Shahna whom Kirk falls in love with (kinda predictible huh?).  Meanwhile Spock and the Enterprise crew search for the missing crew members until they are captured when they find them.  The episode ends in Kirk making a bet with the providers if he can defeat three drill thralls the providers will let everyone go free and Kirk and his crew may return to the Enterprise and if he fails the entire Enterprise crew will be forced to become part of these gladiator games.  I dunno if that was the best bet for Cpt. Kirk to make but he was successful and thats what's important.  I have always loved this episode it is a classic.  It is a typical 'superior beings play with inferior beings' episode but the gladiator fight scenes have to be watched!  It's memorable!<br />Overall I highly recommend Volume 23.  It has two great episodes from Star Trek's second season, one tragic and one classic but both are great.  Highly recommended!
B000003TAB|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best Nirvana-album available. It's always referred to as \\"a tossed-off left-over album\\", but the fact is, nirvana is at heart a \\"tossed-off\\" band. As is evidenced in the last interviews Cobain gave in his life-time, all the band wanted to do was recording their favourite music, and he thought that media-pressure ruined that. This album, and the live-set Muddy Banks Of The Wishkah, contains the spontaneouty that somehow managed to be a bit absent from their regular albums. Nevermind was undoubtly a magnificent effort, but, as with Bleach, it sounds as if the band knew they had to prove themselves. On In Utero, the band spend too much energy in the fight against the media, sounding like a parody of themselves and leaving a bland, forced album in the process. This is the only album on which they sound like they're really having fun, not caring about what others may think of it because it wasn't recorded (well, most of it) with a genuine album in mind. The BBC-sessions are unbeatable, the Dive/Sliver-single is splendid latter-day punkrock, and the Bleach-leftovers sound like they were meant to be on this album.<BR>Even the Fecal Matters-cut Mexican Seafood from 1986 shows full potential, being made 2 years before Bleach hit the streets! Ofcourse this collection isn't complete, but it sounds like it was meant to be this way, it sounds perfect while it's on and maybe 1 cut more would have ruined the enterprise. And if you think this album is totally uncommercial: Listen to Dive, a track that screams \\"Nevermind\\"!
0316776963|4.0|A friend recently lent me this book.  I was delighted that he did so.  I've heard of Mr. Sedaris, but, for some reason, never seemed to get around to reading his book.  Having read the works of his contemporaries such as Michael Thomas Ford, Joel Perry and Bob Smith.  Only Joel Perry rates as being funnier, but David Sedaris has certainly led a more interesting life.<br />I don't know if the title stems from his attempts to overcome a childhood lisp, or his attempts to learn French, either of which are pretty funny.  Mr. Sedaris' string of unusual jobs, performance art pieces, drug experiences and time in France with his boyfriend are all priceless and unique stories.  Listening to an international French class attempting to explain Easter to a Muslim student is priceless, and leads to a flashback to his Greek Orthodox upbringing and memories of holidays falling later than their Catholic equivelent.  Something that had frustrated me throughout my childhood.  <br />Unlike the other authors mentioned above, very little of the book is actually gay.  It just goes to show you gay men can have a life outside their sexuality.
B000050XEI|4.0|Enyas first album of all new material in five years musically, was worth the long wait except that this CD is ridiculously short. 34 minutes? Come on! In this day and age of 80 minute storage capacity there is little excuse to make an album that is as long as a Saturday morning cartoon episode. This CD would've been a five star had it been at least 50 minutes long like most albums today. I have EPs that are longer than 34 minutes! <br />Enough about the CD length. This is an amazing album and is by far her sunniest and most cheerful album to date, almost opposite to Shephard Moons or the ominous masterpiece Watermark. The use of pizzacato strings is heavy on here especially on Wild Child and Flora's Secret which is one of my favorites on this CD. My absolute favorite though is the stormy Tempus Vernum with it's gothic atmosphere. <br />Here's how the song lenghts should've been like:<br />1. A Day Without Rain 4:06<BR>2. Wild Child 4:26<BR>3. Only Time 4:21<BR>4. Tempus Vernum 5:53<BR>5. Deora Ar Mo Chroi 3:46<BR>6. Flora's Secret 5:30<BR>7. Fallen Embers 3:58<BR>8. Silver Inches 2:58<BR>9. Pilgrim 4:38<BR>10. One By One 5:28<BR>11. Lazy Days 4:59<br />A worthy CD of owning but it could've been so much more had it been alot longer than just 34 minutes.
B00005QIPH|5.0|What can you say, this is easily the album of 2001. With great songs from start to finish. The Strokes came in with a lot of hype and Is This It easily bests it; don't compare them to the Hives, The Vines, White Stripes..its not worth it, the Strokes are on a whole different level.<br />Incredible album, start to finish.
B0000542D2|3.0|I agree with the other reviews.  I had been anticipating this release for some time only to be really disappointed in the quality (or lack thereof) on the &quot;remastered Dolby 5.1&quot; sound.  John, Paul, George, and Ringo are still the Fab Four, and they deserve better than this release.  Why do the people running the entertainment industry have such contempt for their artists and their customers?
B00005614M|4.0|Even more than John Coltrane, Miles Davis' cultural icon status has overshadowed his music. So it's worth mentioning that he was a masterful trumpet player who explored the instrument's lower register and tended to play slower, more lyrical lines, often deeply melancholy, rather than the showers of high notes of Dizzy Gillespie and his imitators. If you're new to Miles it's easy to get confused, as he released a multitude of records during a 45-year career, in a bewildering array of different styles. Davis was at the center of almost every movement in modern jazz (except he skipped &quot;free jazz&quot;): early be-bop (he played with Charlie Parker in 1945); the &quot;cool&quot; sound; hard bop; orchestral experimentation; the &quot;modal revolution&quot;; fusion. He also played with most of the key jazz artists of the post-war period, and is probably the single artist who best represents the winding course jazz has taken. <br />I recently got this collection of sides originally released in 1949 and 1950 by the Miles Davis Nonet, not released on LP until 1957. The unusual instrumentation (with French horn and tuba) is carefully used by the arrangers (including Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan and John Lewis) to create an incredibly full sound, with a remarkable range of tonal colors. The tunes are also incredibly beautiful. The famous &quot;cool&quot; sound is a bit too reserved for my taste, and the arrangements have a certain Hollywood aroma, but there's no denying the power and originality of the work here. Fans may find this jarring because of its transitional nature, with obvious big band elements such as Kenny Hagood's dated-sounding vocal on &quot;Darn That Dream.&quot; Some of the arrangements display the breathtaking complexity of later records, though.
6305841861|5.0|Yes it's a remake,for the first ten minutes and then it's all new.Ash(Bruce Campbell)and Linda(Denise Bixler)return to the cabin in the woods,read from the necronomicon and then all hell brakes loose,then four more new people show up to join the fun.Evil Dead 2 DBD is not as gory as the first one,but it's way more funny,it's like watching a 90 minute Three Stooges episode.The DVD is a total getter for any Evil Dead fan or movie fans in general.It comes in a really cool tin,I think the cover art is from the UK poster like the replica inside.The disk as alot of cool features on it,the original theatrical trailer,the trailer for the Evil Dead:Hail To The King videogame for PlayStation1,a featurette called The Gore The Merrier,it's a great featurette if you forget the fact the half of the featurette is from old tapes that Greg Nicotero filmed while shooting ED2.The biggest treat on the DVD is the audio commentary(Say hello to Papa)with Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell,Scott Spiegel and Greg Nicotero.When you watch the movie with the commentary it makes the movie way more funnier,with the four talking about their experiences making the film.I think Sam Raimi is a really great director,think about it,he's gone from the Evil Dead movies to Darkman(my favourite Raimi film)to A Simple Plan to The Gift and of course Spiderman and I really hope he thinks about making a fourth Evil Dead picture.Evil Dead 2 is a sweet,cool,enjoyable and funny flick to watch anytime.Groovy
B000002KBU|5.0|Blue is an absolutely beautiful and sad album, in a way that I hardly ever hear from other artists. Joni seems to stay the slightest bit detached - a little is always lost between writing a song and singing it for the 500th time - but she still wears her heart plainly on her sleeve, her voice cracking and aching and her fingers jumping around on the piano keys and staying extraordinarily elegant the whole way through. Her melodies are gripping and unconventional, and the sound is sparse: an acoustic guitar or piano with minimal embellishments, putting the spotlight on her the whole time. She's a great storyteller, and has a real way with simple beautiful imagery that romanticizes even mundane settings. The lyrics on Blue are mostly sad, with the constant theme of wanting to get away from wherever she is. Even the more upbeat pop masterpieces - &quot;Carey,&quot; &quot;All I Want,&quot; and &quot;California&quot; - have a darker, melancholy edge to them. For once, the slow pacing of the music actually works, and everything is so lovely and relentlessly personal that it ends up being unlike anything else I've ever heard.
B000069HK2|1.0|I didn't even need to listen to this CD.Just hearing that Box Full Of Sharp Objects song made me wretch in pain at the thought of having to listen to this whole CD.What is with that loud screaming.I also heard the Taste of Ink,and I thought it was also ridiculous.This CD is to be avoided at all costs.<br />Peace Out.
078322608X|4.0|12 Monkeys has an unusual pedigree. It was inspired by Chris Marker's brilliant short film Le Jete; written by David Peeples and his spouse (co-screenwriter of Blade Runner, writer of The Unforgiven and Solider); stars Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeline Stowe and directed by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam. It was also released by the very same studio that tried to butcher his masterpiece Brazil during the 80's. Who'd have thunk?<br />The plot is fairly straight forward for a Gilliam directed film: Bruce Willis is a convict sent back in time to find information on a deadly virus that destroys much of  humanity. The survivors have to move underground (somewhat like in The Time Machine).This virus also insinuates itself into the environment making it impossible for humanity to return to the surface.  Willis is to report whatever he finds out before returning home. For doing all this he'll receive a pardon. They want to find information on the 12 Monkeys the terrorist group that took responsibility for the attack and prevent it from occurring.<br />Willis meets a therapist played by Madeline Stowe when he's taken to a mental institution in our world. It's clear that he's disturbed but is that due to the travel through time? Did his fragmented mind make up the entire story? Stowe has to deal with all of this when she is kidnapped later in the film. Willis has fallen in love with her and tries to convince her his tale is true. Now they're on the run from the police and must find out who is behind the 12 Monkeys and where they have the virus.<br />The performances are sharp. Willis is particularly good at playing the sad sack time traveler condemned to wonder if he is insane or truly on a hero's mission. Stowe plays the therapist well and injects humanity into a role that could have been routine in the wrong hands. Brad Pitt plays his most bizarre and interesting role yet. I don't recall if he was nominated for an Academy Award but he should have been.<br />Gilliam's direction is self assured and powerful. He manages to blur the real and imagined in such a way that we're not certain about Willis' sanity. This interesting group of talented artists have created a terrific movie. It's not for everyone though as Gilliam's dark view of humanity and his use of satire might not appeal to everyone. Gilliam and the writers have managed to make an interesting short into a full bodied motion picture.tion is self assured and powerful.

6305508550|5.0|Wow! Where did this movie come from, I saw the poster lots of times but I thought it would be a stupid movie. Boy was I wrong, this is one of the funniest movies I have seen in ages. From the man that brought us Beavis and Butt-head, Mike Judge, who also makes an appearence in the film. If you have not seen this movie, or if you were like me, and thought it looked stupid, go rent it right now. Trust me, you won't regret it.
B000068CNX|5.0|The Friends DVD set have been a true gift for me.  With the busy schedule I keep I can only catch the reruns a couple days a week so it feels like I am skipping all over the place trying to watch the continuing story lines.  With the complete seasons that problem is fixed, on the nights I am home I watch 2 or 3 episodes in order and can watch them in the order they were meant to be seen.  These DVDs also give you a couple of extra minutes per episode, and since most episodes are cut even more for syndication you are actually getting 4 or 5 minutes more footage per episode than you would see watching the reruns.  Season two was the defining moment for this series, all of the big events happen during this year, capped by the Ross and Rachel relationship.  If you are a friends fan this is a must have.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made. It's amazing eye-popping sets and costumes are extremely well done and portray the feelings and movement in the movie quite beautifully.<br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor shine as the parts of Satine and Christian. This movie showed the amazing emotion both are able to act out and the incredible diversity in their acting. I was amazed to find out that McGregor has a breath-taking voice and Kidmans is more than decent. This movie made me, one, have an enormous crush on the sexy, smooth and sweet McGregor and two, realize how great of an actress Kidman is. I've since become a huge fan of hers.<br />The music in this movie is unbelivable as well. The way songs from the past were used and remixed was genius. They could not have picked a better compilation of tunes to carry out the story. I can't even describe the feelings that emerge when they belt out the Elephant Love Song Medley or Roxanne. The two Moulin Rouge cds are on constant rotation in my car, my room and my headphones.<br />I strongly urge you all to see this movie. I think it's one of the greatest cinematic achievements to have come along in a very long time. I really believe you'll love it as much as I do. :o)
0738206679|5.0|The best science book I have read in a very long time.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck's latest has quite a bit to offer, and plenty of the tracks will stick in your memory long after you have finished your first run with the disc, and will no doubt be returning again though.  Some song highlights are: The Golden Age, Already Dead, Side of The Road, End of The Day, and Sunday Sun.  Beck's straight forward songwriting approach is very rewarding indeed, and the music, while very atmospheric for the most part, also has this really cut and dry quality about it.  Far better than &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot; and somewhat more rewarding than 1998's Folk Rock exercise &quot;Mutations.&quot;  &quot;Sea Change&quot; is very much worth your time and is the best Beck album since &quot;Odelay.&quot;  In fact, this particular brand of album is very much at the root of what a lot of Beck's music is about, so buy and enjoy.
B000002MU3|5.0|After the gorgeous and quiet introspection of the magnificent &quot;Automatic for the People&quot; R.E.M. dug out the amps, cranked up the volume for this loud, raucous &quot;monster&quot; (small m) of a disc.  Drawing from their post punk roots and paying tribute to grunge and glam in the process the album is a wild ride totally unlike anything the band had done before it.  Songs like &quot;What the Frequency Kenneth,&quot; &quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot; and &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; are real standouts from the very first spin and there is even a lovely ballad called &quot;Strange Currencies&quot; to even things out a bit.  This isn't R.E.M.'s best album, but there is plenty here to excite.
B00003CXB2|4.0|Most reviews of this movie concentrate on the unbelievable cinematography and sweeping photography, which are right there with the greatest ever. I just saw the currently refurbished version at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco and it was a stunning experience. Brought me back to the days of Milk Duds and drive-ins. But, not to be overlooked: Peter O'Toole is unforgettable here, and the rest of the cast (Omar Sharif, Alec Guiness, etc.) is fantastic. O'Toole delivers one of the greatest acting performances (in a 4 plus hour movie, no less) that I've ever seen. The script--well, they don't write'em like this anymore. It's worth getting this movie for all these other aspects, though don't miss it if it comes to a theater near you.

1400031346|5.0|Mma Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's only female private investigator, should probably have called her agency \\"No. 1 Lady's,\\" since she's its sole operative. But apart from that grammatical slip, she doesn't miss a trick. A \\"traditionally built\\" (read: stout) person creeping up on 40, she decides to enter this field with the money she gains from the sale of her father's cattle after his death. With little more than a desk, a telephone, a typewriter, a small white van, her cleverness and common sense, her loyal secretary Mma Makutsi (who graduated the Botswana College of Secretarial and Office Skills with an average grade of 97%), and the occasional assistance of her good friend, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, she solves cases that range from a freeloading con artist who has tricked an honest woman into believing he is her father, to the abduction for sinister purposes of a young boy by native witch doctors--who have a connection to a very prominent citizen.<br />Smith clearly knows the country and people of which he writes, and succeeds in giving his story a lilting, lyrical flavor that makes the reader feel almost as if she is listening to a story being spun by a native tale-teller. This first of the series bodes well for volumes to follow.
B000002GY9|5.0|Loved my first Tom Waits album \\"The Heart of Saturday Night\\" for its jazzed-up late-night-ramblings feel to it. This was before owning \\"Small Change,\\" however, and here the ante is upped and Waits delves even deeper into the heart of the diners and back alleys of urban America.<br />All my favorite songs on this album are a testament to Waits's tremendous versatility. There is the silvertongue scat \\"Step Right Up...\\" the jazz dive \\"The One that Got Away...\\" the atmospheric \\"Small Change...\\" the weep-into-your-beer \\"Invitation to the Blues.\\" \\"Invitation\\" and \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\" (Waltzing Mathilda) are accompanied by heartbreaking strings and piano. The sax and string bass on some of the more jazzed-up tracks are pretty tight.  <br />BTW I completely agree with the reviewer below that \\"I Can't Wait to Get off Work\\" would have been better middle-album filler, its slot as the final track of the album is somewhat bewildering. Of all the songs of the album that he could have ended on, this one is mediocre at best. The title track would have been the better choice - he used this to close a live performance on \\"Austin City Limits\\" in the late 70s and it was incredible. I'm insanely jealous of anyone who managed to be in the audience that night. For the rest of us, PBS still sometimes airs the reruns, so try and catch it sometime - really is something to see and as far as I know, no recordings of it are commercially available.
1400031354|4.0|Here is the second in Smith's acclaimed new series about the only female private investigator in Botswana. Although more episodic than his debut volume, it maintains the latter's quality with its lyrical style, careful pace, and rich evocation of culture, country, and characters. (I am inevitably reminded of my all-time favorite detective writer, Dell Shannon, who invariably kept one major-case thread running throughout each book while cleaning up assorted smaller ones--sometimes humorous, sometimes grave-- along the way.) <br />We find Precious Ramotswe newly engaged to her longtime friend, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, and in the process of promoting to assistant detective her loyal secretary Mma Makutsi. The emphasis is more on the couple's domestic affairs--the search for an engagement ring, the decision as to which house they will live in, and Mr. Matekoni's thoroughly unexpected acquisition (his bachelorhood notwithstanding) of two foster children--than on casework, but there is still a wife's faithlessness to expose, the fate of a long-missing young American to determine, and Mr. Matekoni's vindictively jealous housemaid to deal with.<br />Like Shannon, Smith skillfully blends the humanizing details of his characters' private lives with the work they do, and although the New York Times called Mma Ramotswe &quot;the Miss Marple of Africa,&quot; to me she seems more like Mrs. Pollifax (another old favorite). At least two further titles are in the wings. If they're as good as this one, they'll be well worth the reader's time.
B0000542D2|2.0|I bought &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and I am really disappointed. It would not play in my Toshiba Carousel DVD player.  The added interviews (filler) do not interest me.  The mono soundtrack had some type of weird phasing sound when I played it on an Apex DVD player connected to my stereo TV.  To make sure I wasn't hearing things, I played it on my desktop PC DVD player through studio monitors.  The remastering sounds like it was heavily processed with noise reduction, and then the lows and highs were boosted.
B00005A1VG|5.0|This is probably the very best movie Errol Flynn ever made, and hang the historical inaccuracies (like those vivid aniline colors).  Still youthful, athletic, and just plain brassy, he does Robin as nobody else has before or since, supported by an able cast that includes frequent romantic co Olivia deHavilland as a spirited Maid Marian, Eugene Pallet and Alan Hale Jr. offering comic relief as Friar Tuck and Little John, Claude Rains suitably oily as Prince John, and Basil Rathbone at his most sardonic as Sir Guy of Gisborne.  Swift, deftly choreographed action alternates seamlessly with humor and thoughtful moments like Robin's talk with Marian in the greenwood, and all the major elements of the Robin legend are fitted in and done justice to.  This movie would be a good way to introduce young viewers to Howard Pyle's written version--is, indeed, to filmed Robin as Pyle is to the great English outlaw in print.  No one who loves adventure films, historic epics, or swashbucklers can possibly call his collection complete without it.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Producer Nigel Goodrich is back on board for Beck's latest opus, Sea Change. Yes everything you've probably read about it being a sad and depressing record is true. Sea Change wallows in misery seldom heard on \\"pop\\" recordings, esp. from someone who's last disc saw him singing about picking up girls in JCPenny with a fresh pack of gum. (Debra from Midnite Vultures) Gone is the electro-kitch of New Pollution and Sex Laws. Also gone are the gen-x type athems like Loser and Beer Can. But, in their place are amazing well-crafted songs about love, the decay of it, and other struggles viewed from one depressed fellow. <br />Sea Change, is more than a bunch of depressing, well-written songs though. On it, we see Beck shed any ties to any trend that might had been left from the wake of his early chart success. (Think about what Radiohead has been up to for a similar tale) Beck makes this opportunity the best he can, by sticking to do a record the way he sees it to be, all the way. Nigel adds to all this glory with a production that rivals anything he's famous for from Radiohead or Travis. Upon further listens, some tracks almost morph into a Bjork like lullaby, complete with electronic wizzes and blips. But all of this production plays a backseat to the raw emotion and guitar based tracks throughout Sea Change. There is no comprimise on Sea Change, and definitely no apologies or dance numbers. It's an intense, beautiful, personal and intelligent record that will go on a lot longer than 2 tables and a microphone. (although, that's hard to beat)

B000059QYB|5.0|If you love Billy Idol's songs but don't have any of his CDs, then this is really the only CD you'll need to buy.  All of his top charting singles are here in this, the definitive GREATEST HITS of The Sneering One. :)<br />William Broad (his real name as most people know by now) came out of England's brief Punk Rock era in the late 1970's with his band Generation X (by far predating the common use of the term which only came into vogue in the '90's).  When the band broke up in 1981, Billy then moved to New York City to pursue stardom on his own.  Dissatisfied with the obvious limitations of Punk (now branded irrelevant by the music industry, and by most rock fans), he sought to blend all of his influences--part Punk, part New Wave, and with a healthy dose of good ol' fashioned R & R--to create a sound that was all his. <br />He got his wish when he hooked up with pyrotechnical guitar wizard Steve Stevens, an American who had been involved with Punk on this side of the Atlantic and was also looking to branch out musically.  Quickly signed to Chrysalis Records after releasing a successful EP (which included an amazing five-minute cover of the Tommy James and the Shondells classic \\"Mony Mony\\"), Billy Idol recorded his debut self-titled full-length LP in 1982 and took the world by storm.  With the advent of MTV at around that time, millions of rock fans got to see Billy's showmanship talents and rugged good looks up front, as well as hear the cool music he made. With FM-radio staples such as \\"White Wedding,\\" \\"Dancing With Myself\\" (a coy allusion to, er, self-gratification, and which he had originally sang with Generation X), and \\"Hot In The City,\\" Billy achieved near-instant stardom.  His follow-up, 1983's REBEL YELL, was even more successful, producing a string of Top Ten hits (on the Billboard Album Rock Chart) that really rocked: the title track, \\"Eyes Without A Face\\" and \\"Flesh For Fantasy.\\" All of them showcased the prodigious guitar talents of Steve Stevens, and all of the videos showcased the sneering, swaggering Billy in all of his rocking glory--and the scantily clad babes in the videos didn't hurt, either! <br />REBEL YELL was the peak of Billy Idol's career, although he did have other major hits afterwards like \\"To Be A Lover,\\" \\"Cradle Of Love\\" and his knife-edged remake of the Doors classic \\"L.A. Woman.\\"  In the early '90's he crashed his Harley and nearly lost his leg--and his life--in the process.  He also had to undergo some major facial reconstructive surgery; his scars being fairly conspicuous in his cameo in the 1997 movie THE WEDDING SINGER.<br />Anyhoo, this CD has all the above smash hits (re-mastered to near-perfect clarity) plus two bonus tracks: A surprising accoustic version of \\"Rebel Yell\\" recorded live in 1993, and his brand-new cover of the Simple Minds mid-80's classic \\"Don't You (Forget About Me).\\"  The former song works well, although I of course still prefer the blazing original.  The latter cut is made ironic by the fact that I (and many others) had at first thought that the singer of \\"Don't You\\" was Billy Idol before learning with surprise that it was Jim Kerr of Simple Minds, a band that we had never heard of beforehand.  Additionally, Billy Idol (along with Roxy Music's Bryan Ferry) had passed on doing this song--and Simple Minds themselves nearly passed on it as well!<br />Like his hero Elvis Presley before him, Billy's sneer and swiveling pelvic region became his trademark (as well as his peroxide-spiked 'do).  Also like Elvis, he lived life in the fast lane; thankfully, he's still around to tell the tale.  This CD tells the tale remarkably well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
0440234743|4.0|Would your lawyer go to great lengths to make sure that your fortune is delivered? As he tries to find a woman who he had no clue even existed. If not you may want to look into talking to Josh Stafford, the lawyer and main character in Grisham's twisted tale about the man who has to travel deep into the jungle to find a woman that his client endowed a rather large fortune. Unexpected twists, turns, and deaths, make this book hard to  put down until your finished. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys to read books with and actual meaning and perception to them.
B000002LMM|5.0|This is no doubt one of the most original soundtracks ever, to one of the most original tv-series ever. This soundtrack is as good as the series, continuing the mystiscm and paranormal feeling. There is no other soundtrack that can make my hair raise on my back like this, it makes it all come back to me, all the scenes from the amazing series.<BR>It has one of the best, well known theme songs ever, &quot;Falling&quot;. It is considered a lovesong, a relaxing song, whatever you call it, it is called genious.<BR>The rest of the songs are more unknown, except for the song that is in the intro and outro in the series. It is a great song too. The rest of the soundtrack ranges from jazzy laidback music(Or should I say muzac), to direct freaky eerie sounds. This is not your ordinary soundtrack, and listening should be avoided with lots of friends, as it can seem to weird and freaky for some. But for those cold nights alone when you want to get a long trip down the memorylane back to Twin Peaks, there is nothing better(except the series) than this soundtrack. Excellent, but hard to describe. Highly recommended, but may be hard to find.

B00004Y6NP|5.0|The Revolutionary Brothers In Arms by Dire Straits. To hard to describe in words, it is a enormous listening experience that have to be heard to be believed. This was the first real CD that was released, also the first to flow out of people`s new set of CD-Players and speakers. It opened up the way to the generation of music youths today takes for granted. Most people, at least teenagers today hold no respect for this album. Its a shame. <br />Not only was this the grand daddy of all cd`s, this is also an extremely good CD.<br />Dire Straits, who changed their sound throughout each cd, found the best one here in this record. It starts of with a great song &quot;So far away&quot;, with memorable text and good sound. Then onto the classics. Money for Nothing and Walk Of Life. These are considered Dire Straits most known song, and for a reason. They are great. Walk of Life is a popular song played by most coverbands today, and the best way to make people get out dancing. I wont go into more detail about these songs, they already speak their own story, and have written their own legend.<BR>Then we get the albums more relaxing tracks, &quot;Your latest trick&quot; And &quot;Why Worry&quot;. Best played kicked back in the chair with a nice cup of hot chocolate on a dark autumn night, these songs will make you relax deep within. The more special songs, are &quot;Ride across the river&quot;, &quot;The Man`s to strong&quot; and &quot;One World&quot;. These combines a moody style with some great guitars, very good original text and the more mystical side of the album, if I may say so. <BR>Then on to the final track, and the title song. Brothers in Arms. Instant classic, forever new and fresh. By the time people had listened to the 8 first songs, and they suddenly got this song too, most people could not hold it anymore, this cd is a fantastical experience. I wont lie when I say that the last song is a part of that. There is not ONE Weak song on this album. Everything sounds clean, not overly mixed and pure. This is music, and in fact, every single band out there in the world, every record Company is now making money on this record. If not this cd had been what it was, it would never have sold so many examples, and the Compact Disc wouldnt been the same. <br />Brothers in arms not only changed the music industry, it also became possibly one of the worlds best records ever.
0553293397|4.0|Anyone who has read Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction masterpiece The Caves of Steel was undoubtedly clamoring for a sequel at the end of the book. The Naked Sun (Asimov would go on to write two more sequels) fulfills the task sufficiently. Although I think that, on the whole, the plot and murder mystery in this book - with less plot twists and turns, false leads, and dead ends - is not as interesting as the one in The Caves of Steel was, it is still thoroughly enjoyable, nonetheless. Granted, the concept of the murder mystery is one of the oldest scenarios in all literature - and was perfected by Conan Doyle, at that - and is, thus, rarely fresh or inventive - indeed, is usually quite stale. This is the real strength of The Naked Sun. This has what is, as far as one could conceivably allow in a murder mystery, a totally original plot. It is strange and intriguing in that the protagonist - and, indeed, the reader - knows nothing, absolutely NOTHING, about the murder. Detectives invariably start out with few clues, but in this he has absolutely none. Another interesting aspect of the book - and the highlight of it, for me - is the world, Solaria, and its inhabitants that Asimov herein describes. They have a truly different and remarkable way of life than that which we may find customary, and Asimov manages to make it believable and highly interesting. These factors combine to make the book interesting and fun to read. It is written in the style of its prequel: fast-paced, exciting, and hard to put down. This is certainly worth reading, if you liked the first one, and I highly reccommend it. For all of this praise, however, I do not find this book to be, on the whole, as good as The Caves of Steel. The Naked Sun, while being an extremely entertaining and fulfilling adventure romp, fails to convey the profundity of the original - indeed, this may stem from the fact that Asimov wrote this book out of incessant demand for a sequel (both from his publisher and his fans) instead of having it arise from pure inspiration. Alas, this is a highly entertaining book that I heartily reccommend to fans of the aforementioned masterpiece.
1563898586|5.0|Alan Moore comes closer to a weaver of Persian rugs than any other comic writer out there.  What do I mean by this?  Simply, that he has woven a tapestry so rich with references that only an expert of old pulp and adventure fiction could hope to catch it all.  Have any doubts?  Search the web for the amateur annotations fans have assembled, showing how each page has literally a dozen references of some sort.  Amazing stuff.

B000002AGN|5.0|Many people (especially of a certain age--I'm 49) will claim that Miles Davis' Kind Of Blue was their introduction to their love for jazz. I am telling you that 9 out of 10 of those people are lying. For most of us, our real introduction to jazz was this album, Time Out. For reasons we won't get into here, it is thought to be cooler to say that one was turned on to jazz by Miles. Maybe it is cooler--but for most of us it isn't the truth.<br />Brubeck to this day wants to perform to the public. He well remembers when jazz was popular music. Hence, he doesn't get defensive when non-jazz lovers like his music. Indeed, that is why this album is so popular and so important. Even people who are largely ignorant of jazz like this music. We can talk about Brubeck's use of unusual time-signatures; but most people won't understand what you are talking about. The great majority never have sat down to 5 minutes of music theory. Those of us young teenagers who loved the Beatles and the Stones instantly liked this album--we didn't know why.<br />The point is we genuinely liked Brubeck and we were astonished that we liked anything called \\"jazz\\". Just as important, some of us began to explore jazz from here. Yes, Miles is great; but he came later. As great as it is, if the first exposure to jazz most of us had was Kind Of Blue we would never have come to like jazz at all.<br />To this day, I love this album. It is bright, funny and intelligent. It is one of those rare works in which the uneducated and the most learned can profit from. Maybe other jazz lovers look down their noses at Time Out; but they do so for reasons that have nothing to do with the music. In their heart of hearts, I'll bet they still like it.

B00006BTCA|5.0|I have bought a lot of cds over the past couple of years.  Most  of them current releases.  There is a a lot of good stuff out there right now, but this one takes them all down.  They have set a new standard. . These guys are so different than anything out there.  Yes we have heard this sound before from the post punk era bands.  Interpol has taken thier formula and packaged it for us in 2002.  Thank God.  This album has so much energy yet at the same time has plenty of atmosphere.  I liked this album upon first listen and like it better with each additonal listen.
0345448898|5.0|These novels are some of the most impressive young adult novels I have ever read.  Pullman has written stories that can appeal to adolescents as well as adults.  Almost as soon as beginning the The Golden Compass I was drawn into caring for the young characters and couldn't wait to find out what would happen to them.  These books are definetly not for young childen, these are not Harry Potters.  However that is what makes the stories so compelling.  The reader does not know what is coming and how the story will end.  As a devout reader on young adult fiction it was a relief to finally read novels with a decidely adult twist, stories that did not \\"dumb down\\" for their audience.  All in all a thouroughly engrossing read.
0765342294|1.0|I DO NOT agree with the publisher regarding the recommended age for this book. There is language in it (e.g., bastard, pisshead) that is highly inappropriate for 9 to 12 year olds. This was originally an adult book that was re-released with a new kid-friendly cover. Regardless of how interesting the story might be, I would not purchase it for my child.
B000026LUB|5.0|I first heard a selection from this C.D. on the CBC the day following 9/11.  It spoke to me like nothing else, word or music, of my feelings of that tragic event.  I had to contact the CBC to find out what the recording was...&quot;Adiemus, Songs of Sanctuary&quot; with the vocalist Miriam Stockley and the London Philharmonic.  The selection was &quot;Hymn&quot; from that C.D.  I have listened to it and played it for friends and many of them have declared it their &quot;new, favourite recording&quot;.  Ms Stockley uses phonetic sounds replacing text and is joined by tribal choruses on some of the songs.  Her vocal range with its deep, rich tones and soaring, graceful intonations captures the imagination and holds you in its spell.  WONDERFUL!
0393312836|5.0|all i hear is people talking about how this book is some sort of political satire. They seem to put it in the same category as 1984 and brave new world and books like that. Fro me this book was closer to The catcher in the ryre or lor dof the flies than it was to those books. I actually dont see this as a political novel at all so much as a novel about youth and growing older and how adults will want to change you when your a teenager. Thats what it was about to me. Aside from that, this book has alot of symbolism i think the entire novel could also be seen as a metaphor for how christian missionaries used to convert indians to christianity and then send them back to theyre country,changed forever. It is a very good, provocative read. WARNING: if you dont like books that contain violence,crude language and graphic sexual content, dont read it

B000002VMH|5.0|What a way to start her solo career!  This album is very different from her songs from Eurythmics.  These songs are mostly melancholy songs that dig deep into her personal struggles and defeats in life.  She sings about being an outcast, losing a child through miscarriage, and loneliness.<br />This CD will make you look inside yourself and see what you need to do with your own life.  It's not a downer!  Don't get em wrong.  It's an honest CD.  You can sense her vulnerability through her songs and the complex arrangements.<br />Purchase this CD!  It's one of the best CD's ever produced!
B000002I97|5.0|this is surely one of the most heart felt albums ever written complemented by tight orchestration that ensures no song is out of date.  albeit a period piece, a must have for any folk music lover.  as i don't know many people who don't already have this i suggest picking it up as it has always been listed at a reasonable price.  can't possibly see how anyone would regret it.  if you don't know too much about john prine get your hands on this one and change you mind (and your freinds) about who is the best folk writer/singer/performer ever.

This four-piece barrage on the senses from Orem, Utah are enough to make any God fearing Mormon from Utah either jump or send them cowering in their closets with a crucifix held high in panic.

B000007S5B|5.0|The Doors songs were always very colorful, and not just in their use of language. Tonal color expresses itself in the way the melody effortlessly chases and/or inheres in what the lyrics and Morrison sing of. The poetry and symbolism drip from the overall sonic mix like some mysterious, archaic elixir of blood, wine and ambrosia/nectar. Dramatic comedy entered into the equation on numbers such as \\"Alabama Song\\". Even if there were no lyrics, or if Morrison's vocal was removed from the mix, we might still feel the meaning, be swept up in it, [and, possibly, even more so].<br />The very air in the room where we are listening (or the space between the two headphone speakers) exudes a subtle yet earthy pungency, circulating almost invisibly around us, a darkly divine scent of sweetness.<br />The Doors third album broadens their tonal palette somewhat into the more sunny regions of tints and pastels (even the album/CD cover projects this aura). The strong elemental colorings [e.g. shades of Hades, Neptune, etc.) of the many songs of their first two albums are thus augmented in the direction of softness on several of the newer songs, though the overall textures still retain a somewhat rough edge, as one might expect. Before this, we got heavily chthonic doses of almost Grecian [and sometimes Romantic Era] dramatic luster, along with the near-epic proportions of songs like \\"The End\\" and \\"When the Music's Over\\". This aspect of the Doors ethos continues to be a large factor, for instance, in songs such as \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\" and \\"Five to One\\"; but now comes into being a new, lyrical side expressed in several of the songs.<br />They continually take us with them on the journey through worlds known and unknown - inner, outer and in between - amplifying the personal dimension with something that grows very, very large. \\"Hello I Love You\\" is a strenuous song of deification, of the woman about whom Jim is singing, but also of the singer, and even the song. \\"She holds her head so high, like a castle in the sky!\\" \\"Sidewalk crouches at her feet, like a dog who begs for something sweet; do you think you'll be the guy to make the queen of the angels cry?\\"<br />\\"Love Street\\" continues on this tack, but evokes softer sorts of musings/emotions - mystery, compassion, and longing. \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\" breaks/melds these tendencies into a moving, evocative apocalyptic relationship of lovers running scared and ecstatic with their beloved, carrying on the work began by \\"The End\\" from the first album, but totally resonant in/with the more fertile-feeling groove of this, the third.<br />\\"Summer's Almost Gone\\" is a much simpler poetic statement, being a lament for and a remembrance of moments gone by, warmly mournful. It's almost a wake, as it were, meaning that summer (it would have been 1968) was, as each passing season is, a living being. Beautiful, expressive guitar solo and licks by Robby Krieger.<br />The next song shows the coming of age of a new season: \\"Wintertime winds blow cruel, this season . . .falling in love I'm hoping to be; love has been lost: is that the reason, trying so desperately to be free? Come with me, dance, my dear . . . winter's so cold this year! You are so warm, my wintertime love to me!\\" John Densmore (the organ player) makes brilliant use of the harpsichord.<br />\\"The Unknown Soldier\\" One of many fine songs to respond to the Vietnam War. This one, both dramatic and impressionistic (and very suitably powerful), includes elements of pathos, brutality and horror, with sound effects and a 'staged' execution, Nazi-style (Morrison as the sergeant barks his orders in heavily German-inflected English).<br />\\"Spanish Caravan\\". Possibly a response to Jimi Hendrix's \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\", the Doors' song is more authentic, beginning with a brilliant and lengthy (and totally traditional) guitar solo which is actually a note-for-note flamenco toque, which segues into a more regular sounding Doors song. Here we have more of theinnovative impressionism, which continues to be the keynote of this album/CD.<br />\\"My Wild Love\\" is a very wild, impassioned chant, using only vocals and a bit of percussion. The emotional tenor of text/realization has to be a first in American pop-rock; possibly, the Fugs' \\"Frenzy\\" from a couple of years back trumped the Doors - but \\"Frenzy\\" was less powerful, more hyperactive, and maybe even a bit more calculated.<br />The band settles down a bit for the next two tunes. First, \\"We Could Be So Good Together\\" which probes the way so many young men and women fell together in love/lust during those times. So much a fantastic mixture of blinding emotion and darkness, a blending of exciting opposites, a mutually charismatic sharing of earthy and heavenly energies which seemed like they could never end!<br />\\"Yes, the River Knows\\" is a song of rare power and beauty, one of the several which seems to brand Morrison and the Doors as one of the two most obvious shamanic bands of the era. (The other of course was Jefferson Airplane, who right around this time were releasing 'Crown of Creation').<br />\\"Five to One\\" is the [lengthy power-rock] revolutionary rant par excellence, which, like so many of Morrison's tunes, is a blending of opposites, this time bringing in a personal love interest to spice up the action, [the text emits some \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" vibrations] and to purposely confuse it.e innovative impressionism, which continues to be the keynote of this album/CD.<br />\\"My Wild Love\\" is a very wild, impassioned chant, using only vocals and a bit of percussion.

B0000683DH|5.0|I've put off buying the STII DVD for some time because I was waiting for a special edition.  It was worth the wait.  And for those of you who couldn't wait, it's worth a double dip.  This is an excellent edition of Star Trek II.<br />First, the print looks beautiful.  The previous DVD had a terrible transfer (I never knew that space was green, for example).  This looks great.  The picture is clear, clean and the colors are perfect.  The sound is excellent, even on a simple stereo TV.<br />The extras are good but not oustanding.  The director's commentary is entertaining.  The 2nd disk leaves a little to be desired (like the ST1 Director's cut) but is worth your time.<br />The additions to the movie for the director's cut are mostly minor and add very little.  There are a few alternate takes of scenes which are slightly inferior to the original, but only if, like me, you know the dialogue by heart, even to the cadence of the actor's voices (yes, I know, I know).  There is also a little bit of extra dialogue in some scenes.  Nothign to write home about, but interesting nonetheless.<br />Of course, the main reason I give this DVD 5 stars is the movie, which many feel is the best of the series.  It is, as the director envisioned, Horatio Hornblower in Space -- complete with exciting battles and compelling characters.  While the movie is a sequel to an episode of the classic TV series, you will not be lost if you haven't seen it.  I hadn't when I first saw Kahn in 1982 and I had no problem following the plot.<br />In short, the extras and new scenes would not make this DVD worth your money.  But the dramatic improvement in image and sound quality demands you purchase this version if you love Wrath of Kahn as much as I do.
B00005JLKB|5.0|The show gives those who were once small chrildren but older now.  This is a view of a story about the MAN OF STEEL a town hero.  It takes those who knew little about the boy and his child hood.  Smallville a story of Clark Kent know to us as Superman, in his child hood years.  For those who were once kids but now adults, who followed the Man of Steel this is a treat.  Movie after Movie and show to show this gives us a look at the boy who is learning to grow and control what he learns about himself.  Fans know what he can do but never did we know how he learned of it or how to wield it.  This gives us the chance to see it in an evolution state.  From those who are young to us older fans we all will enjoy the new story of Superman.<br />The best thing is how he grows in the show with each episode, filled of dilemmas among those the chance to experience his new powers.  There is so much mystery still to reveal to the true fans keeping us hanging on for the next show.  No new series will take you where this one will for those who watch the show or the few who just tune in.  No words can express the show entirely.  For fans I leave this weather you tune in now or have been there since the beginning, no other words to speak besides WATCH in AMAZEMENT.

B00005JKGV|5.0|David Lynch spent most of the early- and mid-1990s in a kind of torpor.  After the cancellation of Twin Peaks and the (deservedly) cool reception to \\"Wild at Heart,\\" Lynch turned to other projects, including his art and another television show that never really made it past the pilot stage.  In 1997, he returned, arms swinging, with \\"Lost Highway,\\" and it was certainly a project for which the wait was worth it.<br />Bill Pullman (whom I normally cannot stand as an actor, but he turns in a killer performance here) plays Fred Madison, an avant-garde jazz saxophonist who suspects his wife (the beautiful Patricia Arquette) is cheating on him.  Someone keeps leaving plain brown envelopes on their doorstep, with videotapes of their house inside.  When one of the tapes shows the couple sleeping, Madison calls the cops.  That night, at a party, he meets a Mysterious Stranger who convinces Madison that something's very wrong.  He doesn't know the half of it, and the rest of the movie is an unraveling of Fred's life, in more ways than one.<br />Some of the typical Lynch stuff is here: mysterious people who seem to be some kind of supernatural force, invisible characters, and characters that `morph' into new characters.  It's also a tribute to the film noir style with some amazing scenes (the desert seduction scene is one of the sexiest ever committed to film), and borrows many elements from \\"Vertigo,\\" a film that was truly ahead of its time.  <br />\\"Lost Highway\\" may seem like it's weird for the sake of being weird, and it's the kind of movie that appeals to those snobby filmgoers who like to brag about figuring out artistic mumbo-jumbo, but it's not.  Lynch, who typically says very little about his films, has given people two clues about \\"Highway\\": it's set in the same `universe' as Twin Peaks, and that the film is essentially a `psychogenic fugue,' a term described in the DSM-III-R as a state where someone under immense stress suddenly adopts an entirely new personality, with new memories.  With that in mind, the film isn't terribly difficult to figure out, if you are familiar with some of Lynch's recurring symbols and his style.  Each Lynch film has a certain theme, and the theme here seems to be how one person deals, psychologically, with his life when he discovers it was not what it seemed to be.  To say any more would ruin the fun, though, except to add that \\"Lost Highway\\" is almost a mirror image of \\"Mulholland Dr.,\\" so if you understand one, it's not difficult to understand the other.  I should also note that, personally, I found \\"Lost Highway\\" to be a (slightly) better film than \\"Mulholland,\\" but still believe \\"Blue Velvet\\" is Lynch's best, so that might offer some kind of measuring stick for those familiar with his other works.<br />Like Lynch's other films, \\"Highway\\" isn't for everyone, but it offers the same kinds of rewards for anyone who wants to engage himself or herself in following the trial of clues \\"Highway\\" offers.<br />Final Grade: A
B00006G8G4|5.0|I'd been waiting a long time to see this movie so the hype for me was far and beyond that of the normal movie-goer. Did it live up to the hype? My answer is a resounding yes. Was it better than Episode 2? No question.<br />This may be considered a super hero movie, but what make's this film so good is it's more about Peter Parker and his feelings for Mary Jane than anything else. Of course there's lots of action and special effects, but it's the story that really shines and that's why the movie was seen by such a wide variety of age groups. The soundtrack is great too. I can't wait for this DVD, I will watch it again and again, as should everyone else in the world.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|This is the remake of \\"Thunderball\\", the Bond story that Danjaq and Eon didn't own the film rights to. So because it was made by another company, it doesn't have the classical Bond opening, the James Bond theme or the usual actors in the parts of M, Q and Moneypenny. In other words, it doesn't quite have the Bond \\"feeling\\". But it's still an entertaining action-adventure. Sean Connery still knows how to play James Bond and Klaus Maria Brandauer is very good as the villain. I can recommend it
B000002B30|3.0|Bruce Springsteen's Greatest Hits has most of the songs you would expect, but several flaws were noticed.<br />The sound quality of the first few cuts, including &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Thunder Road&quot; did not jump off the CD like I had hoped.  Bruce's early anthems have received no improved production and are a simple rehash of the original studio cuts.  I remember getting an electric rush off the LPs I bought back in the 70's.  The sound quality seems muted compared to many recent Greatest Hits albums and reissues by other artists.<br />Secondly, I would have eliminated the new cuts off the greatest hits album.  They are decent songs, but act as a little false advertising.  I know it is a common approach among the record studios when issueing GH albums, but spending the money on going back to the master tracks would have been worth more than the not hit cuts included
B000002H97|5.0|Wanna hard rock and forget about the roll? Debate none further. Without a doubt this is Metallica's best album to date. Enter Sandman is fantastic, Holier Than Thou greatly beat blasted, The Unforgiven heavy ballad perfection, Nothing Else Matters although similar to Unforgiven includes grade-A metal emotion, The God That Failed solid rock rebellion and finally The Struggle Within ideally adopts the punk principle without all that hair color or excessive face piercing. The other half of the tracks don't sacrifice much talent but enough basically to honor the others with the distinction they so rightfully deserve. Unfortunately, most of the band's material since has been hampered either by the 90's ridiculous `progressive` popularity or persistent label requests for them to quickly record whatever tracks they could originally riff out...

B000066NW0|5.0|Every once in a while an album comes along that far exceeds my expectations.  I mean, how good could an album co-written by a 17 year-old girl possibly be?  In the era of Britney-like bubble gum pop, I expected Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go&quot; to be a typical teen pop album with that one song that would ultimately send her into &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot; territory.  Then I pressed play.<br />The album's first track, &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, lets the listener know right off the bat that they are not listening to a Britney wanna-be.  This breakup anthem is a full on rock track with layers of electric guitars and a blistering chorus.  It sounds more like Joan Jett or Pat Benetar than Britney.  The album then moves into &quot;singles territory&quot; with the catchy pop tunes &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, both of which are flooding the radio waves.  Next up is an album highlight, a ballad called &quot;I'm With You&quot;.  Not only is this song surprisingly melodic with a catchy chorus, but the lyrics make you wonder &quot;Did a 17 year-old really write this?&quot;<br />The rest of the album displays the same level of diversity.  Avril can move from Alanis-like hard rock anthems like &quot;Unwanted&quot; to soft ballads like &quot;Tomorrow&quot; back to catchy pop like &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; and &quot;My World&quot;.  This not only shows Avril to be a songwriting force to be reckoned with, but it also demonstrates her ability to succeed at vocal gymnastics.<br />Because of her age, Avril will no doubt be compared to Britney by most reviewers, including myself.  However, when it comes to true musical talent, there really is no comparison.  Avril co-wrote every song on her debut album, she plays guitar, she has a far better voice, and she actually SINGS in concert.  As for Britney &quot;Oops...I Lip-Synched Again&quot; Spears, well...did I mention she looks good in a bikini?<br />&quot;Let Go&quot; is an amazing debut album for any female singer, let alone a 17 year-old.  This album contains a diverse collection of songs that mate catchy melodies with truly meaningful lyrics.  It really is &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;.
B00000ADG2|1.0|The Fugees were tight.<BR>Lauryn Hill by herself... is not.<br />The unbelievably annoying shrill piano tone melody of Doo-Wop (That Thing) will haunt me for the rest of my days! This album cannot possibly stand the test of time, or any other test for that matter.  Don't waste your money.  (Or bandwidth)
B000001DTM|5.0|U2 entered the 90s with a landmark album that rivals the aggressive &quot;War&quot; and the breakthrough &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; as their best one ever. Showing no signs of the band's previous work, this album starts off with the &quot;dance-rock&quot; song &quot;Zoo Station,&quot; which would foreshadow their direction in the last decade. Their collaborations with Brian Eno are obvious, for a lot of the song s seem to be inspired by his work and his ambience. &quot;One&quot; is also one of the best songs in history. That song sends shivers in my spinal column even 10 years later.<BR> Bono's vocals reach an emotional zenith on this album, as well as Edge's rather innovative guitar playing, and Larry Mullen's unique approach to drumming. They haven't made an album this good in the last 10 years, though &quot;AYCLB&quot; comes somewhat close. Essential to any U2 fan, and a sign that U2 would be dominant in the next decade to come, more dominant than they were in the 1980s.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I don't think Singin In the Rain is the greatest musical of all time. Please don't misunderstand my point of view! I love the movie, and I highly recommend the DVD to any fan of movie musicals. I think SITR is extremely funny and witty, tuneful, and just an all round joy to watch. It's a real feel good movie. But there are a couple of things about it that will always irk me. While the Brown & Freed songs are all first rate, the two songs written for the film are weak, and we all know how much Make Em Laugh is a ... of the far superior Be A Clown. I also think the Broadway Melody ballet sticks out like a sore thumb, and slows the movie down. Its completely inappropriate. I've always felt it was a poor excuse to insert a ballet into the film ala American In Paris (where the ballet worked completely). ...
B00003CXZ4|2.0|This movie might interest you if you can look past the fact that it is both inherently flawed in plot and boring as hell.

B00004ZB9D|1.0|I try not to bother too much with negativity, but since I'm running low on music to praise at the moment, I've decided to devote some time to the ample store of music that I find utterly loathsome.  And Lenny Kravitz ranks right at the top of that list (well, right next to Limp Bizkit, anyway).  Many, probably including Lenny himself, seem to want to fancy him some sort of Jimi Hendrix for the modern day.  However, while Lenny has pinched substantial elements of Hendrix's look and sound, there are some important differences between the two.  First of all, Jimi Hendrix had things like creativity, ambition, and a fully-functioning soul.  Mr. Kravitz's music, meanwhile, is about as original and exciting as vanilla ice cream in a plain cone, probably because he makes sure not to do anything that might alienate adolescent girls or collegiate preppies.  Hendrix, while far the most technically skilled singer, had a voice that was often deep, soulful, and evocative.  Lenny, meanwhile, tries way too often to hit high notes and winds up sounding like an eight-year-old boy who's just been repeatedly kicked in the crotch.  Jimi's solos were searing, technical, and often epic and experimental.  Can anyone name me one Lenny Kravitz song with a memorable guitar solo?  Jimi's best-known ballad was probably the the moving, bluesy, and lyrically profound \\"The Wind Cries Mary.\\"  Lenny's best known, ballad, conversely, is probably the repulsive \\"It ain't over till it's over,\\" which features cliched lyrics, bland pop musicianship, and Kravitz's hilariously inept attempts to hit high notes with his voice.  I could go on and on, but here's the point to my semi-coherent rambling:  Lenny Kravitz is a boring and ultra-derivative hack who has little or nothing in common with the men who made classic rock great.  I mean, if you really need an \\"old-school\\" rock fix, here are some much better places to look, from a wide variety of time periods: Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Queens of the Stone Age, Rush, Yes, Black Sabbath, The Clash, on and on into infinity.  Really, though, pretty much anything is preferable to this clown.ater Revival, Queens of the Stone Age, Rush, Yes, Black Sabbath, The Clash, on and on into infinity.

B00005NGSE|5.0|The Scorpions original live album and the final recording with Ulrich Roth, is a blistering concert with fine performances by all. Klaus Meine sings perfectly, the bass and drums are solid, Rudolph Schenker's rythm guitar is driving, and Ulrich Roth plays searing leads.  A great band delivers another first rate performance.  Sound quality is also good.  All Scorpions fans will want this.  One of rocks finest live albums.
B000000WCA|5.0|I was a huge Spice Girls fan back in 1996/1997/1998. Then Geri quit the group and I lost faith in them. Spiceworld is brilliant too, but their debut album has to be the best.<br />Rundown:<br />1. Wannabe<br />Need I say much? EVERYONE knows this song. It was the girls first single, and a brill one at that. I'm sick of it now, but the chorus is very catchy. 5/5<br />2. Say You'll Be There<br />I LOVE this live. It sounds so great. It was the Spice Girls' second single. I love Mel C's backings at the end, and Emma's first verse. The video is funny and overall the song is very cool. 5/5<br />3. 2 Become 1<br />The first ballad you encounter on the CD. It was the Christmas #1 in 1996, and it's sweet. Emma sounds excellent on this song, taking over the bridges. I like Mel B's catchy little thing on the end of the choruses, and the music at the end. Great. 5/5<br />4. Love Thing<br />The first non single track you come across. This is a cute, catchy little song, where the girls tell their men \\"i don't want no pushing and shoving, don't wanna know about that love thing\\". Very singable. 5/5<br />5. Last Time Lover<br />This is my favourite song on the album tied with \\"Naked\\". This is sexy, smooth and brill. Emma sounds AWESOME on the choruses, and Mel B does a great job on the verses. And Geri... sounds EXCELLENT. I LOVE THIS SONG, I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!! 55555555555/5<br />6. Mama<br />This song is the girls' fourth single. It's all about their mothers, and the girls' mums feature in the video. I don't really like this song much, it's too slow for me. But I like the end with the cool choir chorus. 4/5<br />7. Who Do You Think You Are<br />Comic Relief single, which means it has extra credit for being for charity. This is dancy, bouncy and upbeat, a massive change from the guitars and balladness of the last track. It has a great video too. 5/5<br />8. Something Kinda Funny<br />This song gets boring if you listen to it too much. It has cool music and great bridges from Emma.The performance live is brill (especially the performance in Live At Wembley with the dancers), and overall it's a great song. 5/5<br />9. Naked<br />My favourite song tied with \\"Last Time Lover\\". This has creepy music and great vocals. Mel C and Victoria sound awesome on the chorus, and Emma sounds good too. I adore the live performance of this. I LOVE THIS SONG, I LOVE THIS SONG!!!! 55555555555/5<br />10. If U Can't Dance<br />A great way to end the album. This song is upbeat and makes you want to dance. Mel B sounds great, and I love the music. 5/5<br />If you couldn't guess, Emma is my favourite Spice Girl. This album is brilliant. It's a shame the girls have given up on the Spice Girls, since they were a remarkable band. This CD is firmly lodged in my CD collection.
0609610570|2.0|I love to read business leadership books like these.  I'm not a CEO, rather a middle manager.  Usually, I can find something valuable to a person in my position when I read books like Execution.  This book was a big exception!  The ideas in this book are fuzzy, big picture type recommendations.  I cannot say that I got anything really from reading this book.  If you're like me, in a leadership position much closer to the front lines, you'll get more execution information from the book &quot;Getting Things Done&quot;, by David Allen.  I put that stuff to use right away and haven't stopped.

Moreover, if the detective had any clue, he should of solved the murder immediately.  I mean there is a single man who gives everyone the heebie-jeebies, lives near-by, and no one initally interviews him or visits the local dump site.  It stains the crediblity of the plot.

0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is a sad but touching novel that represents the beauty of falling in love.  Author Nicholas Sparks uses a tragic turn of events to prove that your true love is not only ageless but timeless as well.  Landon Carter is the popular guy in school with an arrogant attitude that disgusts young Jamie Sullivan who is the quiet and not-so-popular daughter of a preacher.  Despite their differences the two grow very close to one another, much to the dismay of Pastor Sullivan.  Unfortunately love doesn't always come easy and a twist of fate forces Landon and Jamie to cherish every moment they spend together.  The two race against the inevitable to live out the dream of anyone who has ever truly been in love.  The book is one that is difficult to put down because the reader becomes emotionally involved in the story.  It will leave anyone with a tear in their eye and a better appreciation of their loved ones.

I'm always excited about seeing what's in store for SG-1 in each new episode.  However, I was very dissapointed that season two leaves us hanging with only part 1 of a 2-part episode on the last DVD.  That's a bummer because now I'll have to wait who knows how long for season three to be released on DVD before I get a chance to see part two of that last episode.  That's the only reason I gave this series 4 stars instead of 5.
0446678430|2.0|This book is okay.  Mostly it encourages you to get your mind ready for being rich rather than just assuming that you never will be.  Unfortunately, it spends the first 200 or so pages doing that.  Eventually, it gives cursory treatments of real estate investing, stock options, and building businesses.  Unfortunately, it never tells you *how* to do anything.<br />If you are hoping to educate yourself on how to make a plan for retiring young and rich, do not buy this book.  If you want a feel-good book to get you pumped up about retiring young and rich, then this book is for you.

B000063V8S|4.0|I must admit I remained oddly unmoved by the selection of episodes in ST:TNG Season 4. After a much better-than-expected experience with Season 2 (in part thanks to the direction of Rob Bowman, later of X-Files fame), and of course the absolutely top-notch first half of Season 3, Season 4 seemed to feature a run of solid but unspectactular episodes that just didn't venture much outside the Star Trek: TNG comfort zone. The difficulties with the season's opener, the finale for the Season 3 cliffhanger, presages the writing problems that are to come. Not that there aren't quite a few enjoyable episodes; Data's Day was very good of course (a personal favorite), as was The Drumhead, and I liked Night Terrors, cheesy as it was. Although Family didn't resonate much for me I must admit, it did dare to try new things, and I liked it enough for the attempt. But, this season is where Star Trek:TNG really found it's groove, and I'm not entirely sure this is a good thing. Even the episodes that Rob Bowman directs (after a 3rd Season absence) completely lack his usual visual flair, being subsumed into the Star Trek formula.<BR>Anyway, it seems to me to come down to the ugly matter of cost. Would I like to own this set? Absolutely; I enjoy ST:TNG as much as the next guy, and there were certainly episodes I enjoyed here. But I'm glad I borrowed it from a friend instead of paying the asking price, which I find a bit steep. I'd have gladly paid half the price for a &quot;best of&quot; set a la Farscape, but I just can't justify shelling out the big-time cash for a season that, while achieving consistancy, does it at the cost of not having the top-notch eps.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|David Lynch has created a unique and touching vision of the heart of America. This film is so great, so addicting that I feel it is a disservice to try to describe it in words. It is heartfelt. It is sad. It is celebratory. It is a global cinema classic.  It is a glimpse into our nation that most of the world never gets to see. Stop reading this review right now and buy, rent, or borrow this movie.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth. The very word brings a smile to my face. After watching this movie you will feel happy as well, and probably a little sadness. But what is one without the other?<br />Sarah, a teenager bored with her mundane life, lives in her own fantasy world. But when one of her fantasys comes to life, and she is face to face with the beautiful and frightening goblin king, is it really all she wished for? Can she solve the Labyrinth, save her little brother, and get home... and if she reaches the center, will she want to?<br />I have tried long and hard to think of words to describe this, but I don't think there are any. You can't put it into it's neat little slot. How would you classify it? Childrens movie? It has elements of one perhaps, but look deeper. Muppet movie? No quite there yet... The closest I can get to it is strange and haunting fantasy. It is suitable for all ages and yet it is still entertainment, pure and simple and wonderful. I am deeply in love with this movie, as you probably can tell. While other movies have come and gone as my favorites, this has survived the test of time. Look at the ratings. Are all these wonderful reviews just coincidence... or fate?<br />If you haven't seen it, you are missing out. Take some time, sit down, get comfy, and open your mind. Once you enter, you may not want to turn back.
1402532903|4.0|I listened to the CD version of this book on a long drive. It's the story of a family trying to cope with the death of 14-year-old daughter/sister Susie. Early on, the book is horrifying. But this isn't a depressing book. In fact, it is quite uplifting so see family members and friends deal with the tragedy and eventually pull together. If you're looking for a crime mystery that solves everything and provides complete closure, you probably won't like this book. That's because the crime solving part of the story is in the background for the most part. The major story line revolves around how the family and friends of the dead girl deal cope in the days, months and years after her murder. It's easy to quibble with some of the mangled metaphors and occasional shoddy writing. Still, I found the book a good listen, unlifting in the end.

B000003RCY|5.0|Being a big fan of &quot;Mutter&quot; and &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, I thought I would complete my Rammstein collection with their first album &quot;Herzeleid&quot;. I am a great admirer of the band's work as well as the entire industrial genre. I love the aggressiveness of this type of music, and Rammstein in particular. I may not understand their native language but I can sure feel the emotions the band put into their music. It is probably just as well as that the band sang in German 'cause I wasn't really wild about the english version of their hit &quot;Du Hast&quot;. As soon as I popped &quot;Herzeleid&quot; into my cd stereo and cranked up the volume, I absolutely went nuts over the music. I love the sheer aggressiveness of the opening track &quot;Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen Sehen&quot;. The thunderous drums and searing guitars just collided together to make the perfect song. The aggressiveness of this cd doesn't let up on the second track &quot;Der Meister&quot;. What really blew me away was the ballad &quot;Seemann&quot;. It was so different to hear Til Linderman croon as opposed to growl. Of all the three studio albums Rammstein has put out, &quot;Herzeleid&quot; has to be the most diverse album I have heard. This is by far my favorite Rammstein album with &quot;Mutter&quot; in second, and &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; in third place.
6304005490|4.0|Need I say more?<br />To fans of both these talented and very attractive stars this is a definite must see!  They work oh so well together in this dated but very funny romantic comedy.<br />Day is playing that character she is so well known for--the simple, elegant, and very innocent type. Hudson is playing well, everyone that wears a skirt.  He is charming playboy who hasn't found the one woman that can tame yet.  Does Day do it?  Watch to find out.<br />Watching this for a second time after so many years it is just as good, just as funny and sweet as ever. They are both playing ad execs' that are also playing for each other.  Although, Carol Templeton, Day's character, doesn't realize who Hudson is through half the movie. She half wittedly thinks he is the doctor that is the inventor of a new highly advertised yet nonexistent product called VIP.  She falls in love with him.  Jerry Webster, Hudson's charming yet woman chasing character, falls for Carol hard. He keeps the ruse that he is someone else because Carol has no respect for and can't stand Jerry Webster.<br />Of course, chaos ensues as the couple get to know each other and accidently get married after sampling the new product VIP, which is basically an alcoholic beverage in the form of a candy.<br />Always funny Tony Randall costars, and he is a master of comedy, a true genius as the sidekick to Hudson.  Ann B. Davis, \\"Alice\\" in the \\"Brady Bunch\\" plays Carol's secretary. Also, another t.v. name you may recognize, Donna Douglas, plays a secretary too.<br />This is frothy 60's comedic fun that has a great cast. It's two big stars are very likable, charasmatic, and beautiful people.<br />Highly recommend this for some romantic comedic fun via the 1960's!
B00006F7S4|4.0|... but it's probably the album I needed.  I hadn't heard a note off this disk before I bought it, I don't listen to any music on my computer, so I was expecting a fun, bumpy collection of crazy white boy tunes.  And &quot;Sea Change&quot; is most certainly not that.  <br />No, this album -- a moody, accoustic reflection on the end of a romance -- is Beck's &quot;Blood on the Tracks,&quot; with wistfulness and extra layers of melancholy replacing Dylan's battery acid venom-spray.  <br />I didn't really like this record at first.  I wanted something  caffeinated with a 4/4 dance beat and lots of jokes, but most of the stuff here is closer to dirges, waltzes, and lullabies.  After the first listen or two -- in a car, driving back and forth to work -- I thought the album was a complete downer, and a repetitive one at that.  All the songs seemed to sound the same.  <br />But when I listened to it (loudly) on my stereo while cleaning house one afternoon, I realized what an interesting, engaging work it is and I think I'm going to spend a lot of time with it as fall and winter roll through.<br />It's a weird, atypical record, all right.  Vocally, Beck seems to be channeling Gordon Lightfoot, Nick Drake, Eddie Vedder and Bono.  Musically, he uses some orchestral bombast that clearly seems a nod to &quot;Harvest&quot; and... dare I say it... &quot;November Rain.&quot;  And yet the album is so cohesive, it doesn't sound like he's ripping anybody off or aping anybody or cracking wise.  <br />These are unusual times in which we're living, lately.  There's a lot of bad news going around.  So I guess it seems appropriate that, instead of offering up a forced happy dance record to help drown out the sounds of war, &quot;Sea Change&quot; is a quiet, sincere, somber statement about loss.  That doesn't mean it doesn't have any amiable moments, but it does suggest that Beck is muddling through just like everybody else.
202025462X|4.0|Looking back I'm amazed at the vast diversity of emotions this short novel made me go through. The wholehearted laughter of the first pages led to genuine curiosity in the next that gave way to confused amazement and sheer astonishment. It makes you vibrate and the intense, absorbing dialogue between the two characters is compelling and transports you to a tension-filled word game rollercoaster that will make your skin itch. Easily read in less than two hours this is a bittersweet tale drafted in Nothomb's exquisite and captivating writing.

What isn't so easily discerned is who is good and who is evil. In this film perception truely is everything.<BR>Gomez(Raul Julia) and Moricia(Anjelica Huston) Addams are not your typical people next door. They do, however have an extended family to make them somewhat like a typical modern family. Daughter  Wednesday(Christina Ricci), son Pugsley(Jimmy Workman), Grandma(Judith Malina) and Lurch, the butler(Carel Struycken) help fill the hideous family mansion with life and after-life.<BR>The Addams' have family values they try to pass on to the children, though they are quite different from most value. <BR>The trouble starts when so called normal people enter the picture. The family lawyer(Don Hedaya), Abigail Craven(Elizabeth Wilson) and her son(Christopher Lloyd) plot to steal the Addams family fortune. Using deciet and trechary, the son masquerades as Uncle Festor, Gomez's long lost brother. The schemes they hatch and the obsticales they encounter make for interest and entertainment. The family home is well worth a look. It is filled with props and devices that are a perfect compliment to this unsual family. The characters are protrayed with such skill, it makes them perfectly believable. In fact is is hard at times to tell who the main characters are for the entire cast moves in and out of the spot light to first take the lead than support each other as the story unflolds. A twist at the end makes the finish as unique and unsual as the rest of the picture. This is a great change of pace film fitting neatly between the hilarious and the riduclous.
0876852630|5.0|I'm going to keep this review short and simple for you. This is the second book Bukowski wrote, and its a really good place to start if you are looking to get into Bukowski. The book is filled with short chapters that involve the years Bukowski called his &quot;ten year drunk.&quot; The book chronicles his road trip around the United States, just at the time he was starting to become famous.<br />Its a quick read that includes many of the offbeat and unique observations that this guy makes about the world. You'll laugh every page.<br />Be careful, though. Reading Bukowski can completely change the way you look at things. The day after reading this book you'll have a little less regard for the little things that usually bother people, and a little more confidence in yourself.
0140186409|5.0|Take one recently released criminal, an old man who dreams of bathing in grape juice, a naïve and pregnant young newlywed, and add them to a bowl of thousands of recently misplaced workers, and you have the award-winning recipe for the greatest American classic, The Grapes of Wrath.  With alternating chapters stuffed full of symbolism and spice, Steinbeck captures the picture perfect photo of Americans struggling through the Dustbowl.  Not only does the dialogue fill your hunger for personality, it creates a bond between the reader and the characters.  Closing the pages of this book is like turning away from a family member.  If you're looking for a novel with inspiration hidden between the lines, pick this one up.
B00004RFCM|4.0|To know the title of \\"Sex and the City\\" is to know its premise: four female friends who live in New York and talk about sex throughout each episode.  Being a show about sex (and being on HBO), it is extremely ribald and frequently graphic.  I'm often pretty appalled at Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, and Charlotte's antics, and sometimes disgusted.  Here are four beautiful, designer-clothes-bedecked women with all the time in the world to eat in fancy NYC restaurants and talk about the men they sleep with.  Where's the reality in that?  Where's the morality?  Well, the show advertises itself as being about sex; it doesn't pretend to be anything else.  It's unnecessary to show Miranda in court or Samantha in an office.  That's not what we want to know about these women.  As far as the second question goes, all I can say is, if you want morality, don't watch TV.  I passionately love \\"The Sopranos\\" and don't feel a bit guilty watching it, and it's certainly not more moral than \\"Sex\\".  So I've given up telling myself not to watch it.  It's really quite addicting.  The characters are so vivid, the acting so spot-on, and the humor so sharp that it's hard not to like the show.  Miranda and Samantha are particular favorites of mine.  They're silly, neurotic, childish, and absolutely lovable.  I may not care too much for the premise, but I could watch those two mix cement and enjoy myself.  The critics are right; this show has a special something.
B00003CXDD|3.0|When I first started watching this movie, It seemed stupid, but once I got into it more, it was very enjoyible. I thought the brownies were great! I suggest you at least try out this movie...but if your not into fantasy movies, dont pick it up.
B000068IEU|2.0|I had heard so much about this film.  \\"Its so violent, its so disturbing, blah, blah, blah.\\"  I finally went out and rented it.  What a disappointment!  The story is good enough:  Two girls go the city to see a concert, try buying some pot, and end up being kidnapped by some escaped cons.  The girls are eventually killed and the killers end up hiding, unknowingly, at one of the girl's parents' home, where the parents take their revenge.  But the camera work is awful, the music is stupid, and the acting is average at best.  The two bumbling cops are completely unnecessary and unfunny.  I constantly see this film mentioned in the same company as \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", which is an insult to TCM.  Fred Lincoln, who plays one of the convicts, once said this is the only movie he made that he wished he hadn't, and he went on to make \\"adult\\" films!  Wes Craven went on to make some good films, but this one is lame.
0060930349|5.0|<A History of the American People> was good insofar as it<BR>avoided politically correct fashion, and it was refreshing to hear<BR>the story from someone on the outside, with no vested interest<BR>in any particular group or race. It was<BR>uncommonly admirable in how he consistently spotlighted the import of Christianity in the founding/sustaining of the nation. What<BR>other popular contemporary historian comes close to this achievement? Few if any,<BR>now that Christianity has been systematically banished<BR>from our culture by the left-wing academia. <br />He did however perpetuate the now carved-in-stone myth (\\"lie\\" to be<BR>perfectly blunt -- see Thomas DiLorenzo's <The Real Lincoln><BR>in case you wish to denounce me as an iconoclast) of Lincoln as saviour rather<BR>than destroyer, even though he knew perfectly well that<BR>Lincoln started the War of Northern Agression regardless of the<BR>intention of ending slavery. I can excuse Johnson on the grounds<BR>that he is English; not American. Another Catholic European --<BR>Pope Pius IX -- a lot closer to the situation though, knew exactly what<BR>was at stake: he sent Jefferson Davis a symbolic crown of thorns.<br />Leftists and liberals will<BR>squirm with discomfort over Johnson's history, since<BR>it refuses to join the bandwagon of today's intellectual climate<BR>that dogmatically assails whites and men as the enemy,<BR>while minorities are trotted out as sacrificial<BR>victims for every evil under the sun. He also<BR>valiantly defends (without ever overlooking his faults)<BR>Richard Nixon, a man whose supposed debauchery <BR>has been so deeply engrained in our minds as to render impossible <BR>even accepting him as human. Likewise Johnson<BR>devastates the falsehood of JFK's legacy that<BR>the liberal media deliberately overlooked. <br />Despite the rare misconception<BR>(as stated above regarding Lincoln), Johnson steps back, tells<BR>the truth, and lets the chips fall where they<BR>may. His greatest virtues are his outsider standpoint and his<BR>Christian orientation, both of which make this book <BR>worth reading for Americans<BR>who want to see their country from a keener perspective<BR>than that which pervades other popular books on the subject.<br />I give it 4.5 stars.
B000002UUX|5.0|This album by megadeth is absolutely essential for any metal collection but it also helps one understand why metal is still alive and well in 2002 - why metal is so great.  Without this album, a full comprehension in metal can not be achieved.  This album influenced so many bands.  This album blended so many different elements - furiousity, melodic elements,crunchy thrash riffs and dynamic progressive passages.  Almost everything about it screams classic metal and it is classic metal done the right way.  This album set the standards so high, that metal died shortly after.  Well,hehe, that might be a joke, but it's something to think about.  This album provided a base from which good metal could continue to be made.  <br />Marty Friedman is a god on guitar and as soon you hear the periodical appearances of solos on Hangar 18 you will have no doubt as to why that is so.  Holy Wars...The Punishment due opens with its classic intro, walks through acoustics, sharp melodies and absolutely intense thrash.  Take no Prisoners is a true metal barrage and a mosh pit favourite.  Another true stand out track is Tornado of Souls, which has one of the best solos on the entire CD and some of its best melodies.  With the exception of the two last tracks, all songs are ingeniously crafted, with credit to Dave Mustaine, who unleashed his songwriting prowess.  In case you're wondering how the band sounds, well, they sound like Megadeth.  Megadeth can not be compared to metallica or to anything else, especially after this album.  <br />The only downfalls are Dave Mustaine's vocals, the below average production and the track Dawn Patrol.  This might sound like enough to take away a star, but since everything else is beyond perfect, 5 stars will still stand.  The crazy formulas that calculate good metal are almost all in this album.
0887331939|5.0|I have the hardcover edition of this book.  The oversize illustrations by Wrightson are amazing.  When friends visit and thumb through it, they are always taken aback by the strength and subtlety of Wrightson's pen.  One drawing is a two page spread of Dr. Frankenstein's lab, a 10&quot; x 20&quot; pen and ink drawing crammed with magnificent detail.<br />The text is in large type, but laid out very well, so a great way to gets older kids into this seminal novel.
B000003S0F|4.0|Never a favourite with the critics, this album features extensive chamber group arrangments by Fripp, with cellos, oboes, flute etc. It is very dark and moody in spots and light and airy in others. There is none of the &quot;dangerous&quot; writing found in tunes like 21st Century and Pictures of a City, and the humour of Happy Family and Cat Food is missing; this album is more introspective. It's also the last Crimson with Pete Sinfield from the classic period, though Sinfield's lyrics are excellent as always. I own the 24-bit remaster by Robert Fripp, and the sound quality is excellent, absolutely exquisite.  There is still the signature Crimson tune &quot;Formentera Lady&quot; and a heavy guitar/sax blowout on the instrumental &quot;Sailor's Tale&quot;, and &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot; is heavy and bluesy, and maybe even a little out of place. For the rest of the album get out your pillow. Not that it's boring, just quiet. It is actually a good album, good performances and the arrangements are convincing and mature. On Court, Crimson was originally a writing collective, and Fripp had been left holding the bag after everyone quit on him after the Court tour. With Islands, the 3rd album after the breakup, Fripp's influence is quite strong and I would guess at this time he was more interested in the possibilities of the chamber orchestra than grinding out some heavy jazzy epics. A Crimson element that is almost absent is the mellotron. Mel Collins is present mostly as a flautist, and pianist Keith Tippet, always a huge asset to post-Lake Crimson, is used to good effect. The production is very bare, and with the remastered version it's like Boz and the orchestra are both in the room next to you...I would say this album continues in the same direction as Lizard, but with less emphasis on the potential of the electric instruments, and more on Fripp's chamber arrangements. Between the two I would recommend Lizard as the more typically Crimson. With Islands, Fripp wascarrying most of the composing load. Fripp would disband this Crimson after Islands. The next step would take Crimson back to the top of their game, when Fripp reformed a new, much heavier Crimson with great artists Bill Bruford and John Wetton.
9999390145|5.0|Not only is the story by Allen Moore compelling (not the usual adolescent stories you'd normally expect from comic books), but the artwork by Brian Bolland is RIVETTING, definitely in a class of it's own.  You will want more, the only problem being that great writing and great art come together so rarely.
B000003S0D|5.0|I discovered this album and Islands recently. I think this is a more true Crimson-sounding album than Islands, simply because there is more guitar and mellotron. The first track Cirkus is classic Crimson all the way, with lots of trademark mellotron, Fripp-clean guitar, flute etc. Indoor Games is a catchy number and Happy Family is a classic. I think it is this song that gets the incorrect &quot;jazz&quot; adjective thrown at it. It's &quot;jazzy&quot; I guess, mainly due to Keith Tippet, who is an accomplished jazz player and a composer as well. But this album is no more jazz than was Bowie's song &quot;Alladin Sane&quot; with Tippets' crazy piano solo at the end (absolutely amazing by the way). The long piece &quot;Lizard&quot; 1st section (Prince Rupert) features Jon Anderson in a typically sing-song tune perfect for his style, the refrain sounding very lush and Yes-ish. The tune &quot;Lizard&quot; actually has  several contrasting sections over its 20 minutes. But still this is a more Crimson-ish album than their next one, Islands, which is very chamber-orchestral and introspective. And don't let anyone tell you Wake of Poseidon is any less of a Crimson album. It's as good as any of the others! Even a little better than this one. But Lizard, as the first album after Poseidon and the first without Greg Lake, does represent a shift in style as Fripp moved away from the Court influence, making the quiet parts a little quieter and the loud parts a little less...&quot;dangerous&quot;, as Fripp says when he refers to tunes like 21st Century and Pictures of a City. Also keep in mind that the Court version of Crimson was a writing collective, so when the rest of the band quit after the Court tour, Fripp was left holding the bag for writing the music. <BR>I believe Gord Haskell, a very accomplished bassist, was the original 1st choice for the band before Court. But Fripp had had the same music teacher as Greg Lake and wanted him in the band, as he was a better singer andfront-man. He gave the band a choice, saying he would leave if Lake was not in the band. Funny that after the whole band quit on him after the Court tour, Fripp used Haskell. (This according to the extremely informative essays by Fripp in the booklet for the &quot;Epitaph&quot; box set.)
B00005JKCH|5.0|Now when first seeing the previews for the Spider Man movie I didn't think highly of it. When the event on the twin towers occured many were touched on it and the movie was then canceled on its release date as well as others such as Trainng Day and Collateral Damage. Hearing that the Spider Man movie had a scene which they showed the two twin towers in I felt I must see the movie when finally releasing 6 months after its original release date. I have been a big Spider Man fan and have read many of the comics so still being a true fan I went to see the movie when released at theatres and when all was over Spider Man was one of the best movies I have seen in some time.  Now in the comics Gwen Stacy the true love of Peter Parker before Mary Jane Watson never existed to the movies story. Gwen Stacy dying by the same villian Green Goblin who also I didn't think could be a good villian compared to others such as Venom, Carnage, or the Lizard, William Dafoe played the Green Goblin to an excellent villian. There was some other changes to the movie from comics such as Flash Thompson the bully to Peter Parker though being in the comic a best friend but all in all Spider Man was action packed with a great story line. If you love other movies based after comics such as the Superman movies, Batman movies or even Wesley Snipes in Blade and Blade 2, Spider Man is a must have.
0920668372|1.0|This has got to be the freakiest children's book I have ever read. It's about a mother who can't let go of her children and who resorts to literally crawling across her son's floor in the middle of the night -- throughout his life -- just to hold him. I'd like to think that the many folks who have given this book praise are not mentally unstable, but can't help but wonder. This book is for tjose mothers trying to justify the use of their own talons in the lives of their children. It's an unhealthy demonstration of positive parent/child relationships and should not be placed in any home, much less read or even published anymore. I strongly recommend against this book -- unless of course, you're a psychotic mother is serious need of mental help. If you click \\"purchase\\", the next thing I'd recommend doing is admitting you need help and finding a psychiatrist ASAP. This is not a good book; this is a tragedy.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|When first seeing Blade one it had a good story that was action packed with vampires. Then when first seeing Blade two it was much more better then I could have thought, it's story was stronger as a sequel always should be and its action packed storyline carried on incredibly. The mutated vampires were the perfect villian any movie could need to make it being pure action with the great actor Wesley Snipes also known for other excellent movies such as Passenger 57 and the Art of War. When first seeing this you can jump and feel the scare of seeing blood and gore this movie presents, it is rated R so if you feel this movie won't live to its potential you must buy it and realize you were wrong. This movie by far was one of the best movies made and released with excellent DTS sound for one to buy and own with there dvd collection today.
B000069CWE|5.0|If you are shying away from buying &quot;Reanimation&quot; for the simple reason that it's a remix album, don't let that fear hold you back. Buy it. This album is hott and it's not like those other remixes albums. Every remix on here is well done, and re-creates each song so that it is truly a remix, and not the same song with a different beat. All the rhythms have been re-done and words have been changed. All the emotion is still there too, the anger and sorrow. This is defintely on of the best rock albums of the year, not to mention one of the best albums all together from this year. If you're a Linkin' Park fan, this is a must have. And if you're not a fan but are curious about their music, Reanimation is a good place to start.
0316666343|5.0|I don't know who Alice Sebold is, or even what she has written before, but I know that I will be recommending this book to everyone that cares to hear it from me.  <br />This is such a lovely story about an awful thing.  Does that make sense?  The unique point of view (Susie speaks from heaven, of course) and the author's down to earth style make this a wonderful read.  I literally lost sleep because of this book.  I was up way too late several nights in a row reading, and even had some dreams about heaven as a result of it.<br />What else can I say, except you will love the characters in this story, you will look at things around you in a different way as you work through this story, and you will tell people about it any chance you can get. <br />I will look forward to reading anything that I can find by this author.
0060920386|4.0|A very good book that is extremely thorough.  If you want to know how deals were done on Wall St in the 1980s, this book is for you.  To a large extent, it is also about the riches of the time -- the air force of RJR, for example.  In the end, what we have are people who claw their way to the top not necessarily for money anymore, but to relieve their boredom (Ross Johnson) and to gain more power (Kravis).  The book is a little long in the sense that at least 4/5 of it are devoted to the deal process (I think it could have been 100 pages shorter), but still worth it, esp for those intent on getting the details behind the deal.  I guess in 1991 that was a little more interesting than it is now.  Another good corporate read, although not a book about Wall St deals per se, is The Informant.
B00003CY6M|4.0|I will keep this brief.  If you like John Cusack films, you will love this movie.  Very entertaining and extremely romantic.  It really makes you feel lucky to have found your own \\"soulmate\\".  I HIGHLY reccomend this film to all you romantics out there.  Watch it with your girl...
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is by far one of the best musicians out today.  His more mellow sound and amazing lyrics cannot be compared to.  I saw him in concert in San Diego with Guster and John Butler Trio and he connected with everyone in the audience.  Although &quot;No Such Thing&quot; is kind of &quot;poppy&quot; and is played all the time on the radio, it isn't one of his best.  The CD along with Inside Wanting Out are two CD's that are worth buying.  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXA2|5.0|...but I find no reason to regret!<br />Yes, I heard about this film already years ago. Just I did not find the time to see it. In fact, in '94 I was going through some equally unbelievable happenings as the main character in this film.<BR>My advice: Get it!
044022165X|5.0|When I looked at this book, I thought to myself, \\"there is no way I will read such a long book,\\" but as I began to leaf through the pages, I sat down and read it. Three hours later I was still engulfed in it. The description is so vivid I feel as if I'm in the story line myself. I can relate to the situations the characters deal with. There are many conflicts that all intertwine with one another. A love story evolves, but doesn't disrupt the main plot.  I had already watched the movie, so I always pictured the main character, Rudy, as Matt Damon. When I finished the book, I was upset; I wish it were a never-ending novel.

B00006FDCD|4.0|This is a rather well-done adaptation of one of King's finest works. There are actually some chilling scenes, which is a rarity for a made-for-TV-movie. <BR>It is the story of seven childhood friends who band together to beat an evil entity, only to have it resurface 30 years later. The friends, having made a pact to return and defeat the evil should it ever come back, must face their fears as adults and fulfill their promise.<BR>The strength of the book, which is the friendship formed between the kids in a town inhabited by evil, can't be exactly mirrored on the small screen, but, again, a fine job at hitting most of the important points.<BR>CAUTION: The two-sided disc is incorrectly labeled \\"Full Screen\\" and \\"Widescreen.\\" The \\"Full Screen\\" side is actually Part I, and the \\"Widescreen\\" side is Part II. If you don't know the chronology of the plot or haven't read the book, this could spoil some of the story. However, it is interesting to note that both parts still convey an effective plotline when viewed independent of one another.
B00006L3LD|3.0|Well, I bought this album in October 2001, three days after it came out because it was a \\"LIMITED EDITION CD, Includes exclusive video footage of the making of 'Morning View' in CD ROM multimedia!!\\" (Direct quote from the sticker on the jewel case).  So after a couple months I saw that my version of the CD was no longer in stores, so then I could say that I have CD with bonus features while you have the regular version.  But now I'm angry because they released this with the bonus DVD, which I really wanna check out, but I'm not gonna shell out 15 bucks at a store, unless it's really cheap, for a CD I bought because of its Limited Edition-ness.  The CD is great, but the record company is making me mad b/c I'll never see the DVD (none of my friends like incubus).
6302814359|2.0|Well, to start out, I would like to safely say that Return of the Living Dead Part II is definatly NOT the greatest zombie movie I've seen ...  The zombies that the creators have chosen are terrible compared to it's predissesor zombies in ROTLD part I.  ... I want to become just the least bit scared.  Not with ROTLD 2.  This movie is definatly one to see with the kids if you've got 'em!!  ...
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters INC is a hilarious movie, and I definately recommend it to anyone that wants to laugh!  The dialogues of the unique characters are hysterical, and the graphics are very colorful and advanced.  I went to see it for the first time with a friend, and ended up going back to the theater to see it two more times with my family and boyfriend!  They all loved it just as much as I did.  The entire plot is exciting, funny, and cute.  The writers and artists that created this masterpiece are extremely creative, and I'm so glad they made this movie!
B000001ESJ|4.0|The studio follow-up to \\"2112\\" in 1977 saw Rush developing a cleaner, less-heavy sound with still plenty of punch.  The also began to explore different musical elements, including classical guitar and jazz fusion, along with tricky time signatures and unexpected changes.<br />1.  A Farewell to Kings:  A socially-conscious piece that could have been written about a pre-Renaissance period or current one.  I love the classical guitar intro, building with keyboards and bells and then the great power chords that bring us fully into the song.  Excellent lyrics by N. Peart, with \\"castles in the distance\\" and foreshadowing \\"Closer to the Heart\\".  Plus, there's the terrific fusion jam with excellent ensemble playing by Lee, Lifeson and Peart. 4 stars.<br />2.  Xanada:  Yes, Peart lifted many of the lyrics from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \\"Kublai Khan\\" but this is still a great epic, full of atmospherics, building dynamics and nice scale techniques.  Excellent lyrical imagery of the pleasure dome! 4 stars.<br />3.  Closer to the Heart:  Simple yet powerful socially/politically conscious lyrics and a nice keyboard/guitar melody.  Good vocal performance by G. Lee. 5 stars.<br />4.  Cinderella Man:  A much better lyrical effort by Lee than \\"Tears\\" with another great ensemble jam.  3 stars.<br />5.  Madrigal:  Probably one of their shortest stand along songs, this relationship piece has nice poetic imagery and an underrated bassline. 3 stars.<br />6.  Cygnus X-1:  Another goofy \\"spoken word\\" intro like \\"The Necromancer\\" brings this one down a notch.  It was cool when I was a teenager but brings a smirk now.  Still, this piece has all kinds of cool time signature changes.  For another literary reference, we have a spaceship named 'Rocinante' after Don Quixote's horse, so there's a little wink from Mr. Peart there.  The music works with the lyrics, however, and the listener does feel like they're plunging into a black hole.  The \\"to be continued...\\" must have been a first in the progressive rock era and hints at a connection to the next offering from Rush.<br />3 stars.era and hints at a connection to the next offering from Rush.<BR>3 stars.
0446608955|4.0|Most of the time, lovey dovey romantic novels do not interest me, but A Walk To Remember was certainly a novel that I will never regret reading.  Since I had seen previews for the movie version of the book, I obtained some sense of what the storyline was about.  I had heard that the novel and the movie differed in many ways, therefore encouraging me to read the novel. One indifference is in the beginning of the two versions.  In the movie version, one of the main characters, Landon Carter, is projected more as a troublesome kid.  While as in the novel, the audience does not receive a message that extreme.  Another indifference is the ending of the novel, but you will have to read the book to understand the point I am trying to make.  <BR>  <br />A Walk To Remember is a romantic novel, and a  great story for teenage girls to read and enjoy.  It centers around two characters, Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan.  This popular high school throb and quiet outcast meet due to Landon's misdoings.  Never would he had known that getting in trouble would lead him to discover the love of his life.  The novel takes the reader through Jamie and Landon's journey to learn about one another.  The novel's most critical moment takes place during the school play as Landon realizes Jamie's beauty she endures within.  Upon discovering a sickness that Jamie has survived for quite some time, the reader is captivated into emotions of sadness, happiness, and tears, as Landon and Jamie make the most of their time together.<BR> <br />Throughout this novel, the idea of judgmentality and openness are portrayed by these two unique characters.  Jamie's Christian morals and Landon's rebellious actions combine together forming two new people into one.  This novel is the best novel I have ever read and appreciated in a very long time.  The central message of the novel is such an unforgotten and important meaning that it has affected the way I think in many ways.  I have come to understand that life isa blessing, and to take advantage of it is just like throwing life away.  I also learned that true love can last forever.  Once it is found, love can continue after death.  Love is the center of the soul, and the soul never dies.  This novel seizes its audience so well, that I am left crying over and over again.  I think this book was written beautifully and with pure heart and soul.  I admire Nicholas Sparks, for I think he has written one of the best love stories throughout my time.  I encourage anyone to pick this book up and read the first line, because from then on you will not be able to stop reading it.  This book is five star quality with two thumbs up!!
B000068IEU|5.0|Its no surprise this film (and a slew of others) were made at the beginning of the 70s. It was a dangerous time, where serial killing was happening more and more. This film can be seen as a commentary and warning for the time: murder is real, and can happen to anyone. And that is what this film is about, two teenage girls are killed by escaped prisoners. But in a twist in the horror genre, the family members end up getting their revenge with their own hands. <br />This is Wes Craven's first major film, and was tremendously influential to the horror, particularly the slasher genre. Horror films constantly steel from this film. As they do with Cravens other two wildly influential films Nightmare on Elm Street, and Scream. Craven shows how well he is at directing horror, all shots are picked to created the most dread and suspense. Foreshadowing is used a lot, and the film has a very stark realistic tone. The only problems are: this is a touchy subject and the film is so realistic I can understand how easily upset someone might get. Another problem is the soundtrack is not all that good, and not suspenseful at all, its basically light 70s rock. The performances are done well as the killers seem like ruthless sociopaths, but the two teenage girls dont show much terror as would be expected. Maybe they are just too shocked. The very first scene is kinda silly, but the rest is good, especially the final part. The middle of the film is mostly a realistic depiction of what its like to be murdered. <br />Overall this is a very well made horror film, and all horror fans should definitely see this, as this is a major film in the history of horror. As for most other people, there are films in other genres that are not so graphic that are revenge flicks you could enjoy, if you find realistic graphic scenes of killing and rape too much for you. 5 stars, check out, if you dare.
0440213525|4.0|John Grisham's, The Client, lives up to the reputation we have come to expect from such a prized author.  The novel progresses slowly at times but the plot has so many twists that it keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the chapters. Mark Sway, an eleven-year-old southern punk, along with his younger brother Ricky, innocently stumble upon a suicidal lawyer. Mark is let in on the biggest secret of a very high profile mob killer: where the body of murdered Senator Boyette is buried.  Watching the lawyer kill himself sends Ricky into a comatose stage and Mark into a legal battle between the FBI and mob.  While Ricky lays in the hospital, Mark sets out on his own to resolve his problem, and soon finds that he needs the help of the most unlikely person, Reggie Love, a female lawyer who has as much of a sticky past as the Sway family does.  Along with Reggie, Mark finds the confidence to face the problems that lay ahead of him.  That is, until he realizes that his life, as well as his families may be at stake.  Mark must choose who the most lethal killer is, the FBI or the mob, and risk his family's life in the process. The main character being an eleven-year-old kid helps Grisham achieve a different prospective than the other legal thrillers we have seen from him.  With a strong plot and characters, The Client is a great addition to your Grisham collection.
B00003CXTF|3.0|If the director is willing to take out about 2 hours of love stories and historical mistakes, add more historical FACT, this might be a superb movie.<br />  When I rent this vedeo, I was hoping to learn about the attack on Pearl Harbor, but sadly, it contains about 2 hours of love story(which is BORING). I also saw MANY historical error, which I feel angry. I'm not a Ben Afflick fan either.<br />  The ONLY thing that raise the rating is the stunning and superb battle scene. I highly recommand buying Tora! Tora! Tora! instead.
B000069HKH|4.0|Bruce Springsteen has created a lasting sentiment for a period that will define the early 21st century.  The Rising is a major achievement for an artist who when given the challenge to capture a period of history that is still so close to the surface for many of us, is able to deliver, with emotion and intelligence.<br />The Rising is not an album that Bruce planned to record, for that reason, it stands alone among all of his previous work. Bruce has always been gifted at capturing the larger challenges of the American Dream through the stories of fictional characters he has created.  In &quot;The Rising,&quot; Bruce's characters seem less than fictional and more real.  Whether it be the firefighter in &quot;Nothing Man&quot; or the grieving spouse in &quot;You&quot;re Missing,&quot; we are not being introduced to these people for the first time, but already know them intimately.  <br />As we listen to each song, we feel the mixed emotions of being in relationship with those that are in pain.  We are inspired by their strength, we grieve for their loss, we witness their confusion and we pray for their health.  <br />The Rising is an opportunity for us grieve and to find the strength to move on.
B00004W199|4.0|It was undoubtedly the low budget and no-name cast that kept this groundbreaking 1962 thriller off the radar for about 25 years. Only after a late 80's theatrical revival did audiences and critics begin to realize that &quot;Carnival Of Souls&quot; was a genre-defining entry in what we have come to think of as the &quot;modern&quot; horror film (well,a near photo-finish with &quot;Psycho&quot;, at least!). Candace Hilligoss (who perhaps should have considered a stage name...&quot;Candy Hill&quot;, anyone?) gives a memorably haunting performance as an existential church organist (&quot;It's just a job to me&quot;) who emerges from a murky river hours after a seemingly fatal car wreck. Without giving too much away, let's just say Candace's &quot;reality&quot; proceeds to get even murkier as she aimlessly wanders a bleak Kansas landscape (hint: you'll soon begin to feel she's not in Kansas anymore!) This is the type of film that can be easily dismissed as laughable low-budget corn, or could inspire a 5,000-word Master's Thesis called &quot;Stygian Symbolism in The New Frontier: God and Existentialism in German Expressionist/Bergman-Influenced American Horror Cinema of the Kennedy Era&quot;. At any rate, cognizant viewers will surely recognise the cinematic roots of &quot;Siesta&quot;, &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot; &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, and even &quot;Eraserhead&quot; (the creepy and disturbing pipe organ soundtrack to &quot;Carnival&quot; had to have influenced Lynch). Pleasant dreams!
0553274503|5.0|This is a very unique book written in first person by a mentally challenged person.  Some readers may be turned off by the simple writing at the beginning and miss out on one of the best books I have ever read.  The premise is that the mentally challenged person is to receive an operation to increase his intelligence.  The operation is successful and as the book progresses, the writing style improves and the thought process of the author gets more complex and analytic.<br />Amazing writing by Keyes!
0930289234|4.0|This graphic novel has everything you could ever want. The characters are well-developed, if a little morose and deeply in need of therapy. The plot is complicated, with a lot of twists and turns. The morality is more complex than a four-colour comic, adding an extra dimension. The art has sometimes been mocked for being a little to realistic, but I thought it was quite good and I liked that the artist was obviously enjoying what he was drawing.<br />So, why not five stars? Because it's not Eisner's \\"Into the Storm.\\" That's all.
0385720920|2.0|I was handed this book by a friend who just read it, said it was \\"okay, but not great.\\" That pretty much sums up my opinion as well.<br />I can see how someone could really like this book. It's quirky, has some dark humor, and I suppose it's even shocking if you've not been exposed much to similar literature. It's just that I've read books that do the same sort of thing a lot better, and it's also not the style of book I tend to enjoy.  I found the story to be a bit lackluster and repetitive. A lot of chewed up food, a lot of sex in uncomfortable places, and a lot of depressing nursing home description. The narrator eventually reaches a sort of epiphany, but by the time he does, I really didn't care any more. The book held my attention long enough for me to get through it, but had no real effect on me.<br />I'm surprised in reading the reviews how many people describe the book as \\"shocking\\" or \\"not for the squeamish or faint of heart.\\" It made me wonder if I've read a few too many explicit books. Yeah, there's a lot of sex in the book, but it's no more graphic or shocking than in other books I've read. In fact, it's often described euphemistically enough that it's like reading about a sexual act as described by a sixteen year old boy, someone who's enthusiastic about sex, but still a little embarrassed when it comes to actually giving sexual organs and experiences their real names.
B00001MXWX|5.0|I have read the reviews and they certainly are mixed. In my and my family's opinion (we are all trekkies) this movie is simply the best to date (pre-Nemesis). It has character instead of the usual pomp and circumstance (which I like as well). But, something was different here, there is a real cause, it provokes a real longing to see the right thing done. The acting was simply phenomenal. This is not your run of the mill sci-fi - simply much more. If you are just interested in visual effects - get a life and watch something boring. This one is way above the baseline. The movie doesn't rely simply on the techno skill of the special effects crew - it relies on the actors as well and the cause - a wonderful movie with a real heart. The people on this planet represent what we all might like to have - a real life of satisfaction away from the pressures and demands that drive us into the grave 20 years before our time - something worth fighting for.
B000065U1N|4.0|Intersting that certain folks who give bad reviews for this movie does not apparently realize that it was the Army involved during this battle (and obviously the movie) rather than the Marines. Anyway, this movie is one of the sharpest, most compelling war movies to have been made. Ridley Scott's hyper-direction makes it appear as if you were on the ground with the Rangers, Seals and Delta Force. Many complaints were voiced over the apparent lack of characterization of the many troops who were fictionalized during this movie. I disagree and am actually glad that we didn't have to sit through another &quot;Joe&quot; showing us a picture of his girlfriend back home only to see him blown up minutes later. Personally I am looking forward to the Special Edition version of this movie rumoured to be released early next year. Bottom line: good movie, ultra violent, views like a documentary, tough to watch because of the realism, nice reference quality sound for your home theater.

B000001DTM|5.0|Second only to the Joshua Tree, Actung Baby is one of many U2 masterpieces.  This album does it all, from ballad to rock U2 covers all their strengths and goes into uncharted territory with this work.  The song, &quot;One&quot; is worth buying the CD all on it's own.  Sure, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; is a great song, but &quot;One,&quot; so symbolic of where the band was at the time is one of U2's best tracks ever.  &quot;One&quot; is not only one of the great U2 songs of all time, but the video for one was a classic as well.  If you like Rock, and you like any U2, you have to have this CD.  It is a keeper.
B00000253N|2.0|I'll probably be kicked in my Cyber teeth by all of the Dylanophiles online, but this has to be said:<br />If you are into Dylan for his carnalvalistic lyrical rides, then DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. It is full of much more introspective and straight-forward themes. <br />This is more like a &quot;beer&quot; record. Toss one back and reminece. Then when you're over it, go put on Hwy. 61 or something.
B00006AG5N|5.0|30 #1 hits?  What else needs to be said, this CD is worth every penny.  The remix &quot;A little less conversation,&quot; is worth the money by itself.  Who else but Elvis could land a hit on the charts years after he is dead?  Noone!  This CD is perfect quality, some of the tracks have never sounded better.  This is a CD anyone who likes music should have.  This is the definitive collection of the Kings best work.  You will love it!
6304602979|4.0|True Romance is, in certain ways, an even more accurate representation of Quentin Tarantino's works than Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, for it contains both Tarantino's strongest and weakest forts.  Notably, True Romance was his first sold script, so it acts as a kind of express ticket into Tarantino style.<br />Director Tony Scott deserves a big round of applause because here, as in The Last Boy Scout, he is able to adapt his cinematic style to a very different kind of script.  True Romance the film stays very true to the tone of the script, right down to the excessive corniness, brutal violence, and hyperkinetic energy.<br />The story really aims to be a love story.  But I think it only succeeds half way.  Tarantino has never been good at crafting female characters -- fortunately, Alabama is one of his best attempts, and she is definitely better than the whiny Fabienne and Honey Bunny from Pulp Fiction.  Her relationship with Clarence (Christian Slater, in one of his best roles) is a little shallow because their initial attraction is a little too brief and riddled with Tarantino's favourite male-female device, baby talk.  Sorry, I have a weak stomach for this device.  But Patricia Arquette gives her all here in a fierce, brave performance that she's never quite topped; whatever problems I have with Alabama stems from the writing, not the acting.  Alabama and Clarence's &quot;connection&quot; scenes pale visibly in comparison with the ferocious scenes with the male characters including the now legendary &quot;Sicilian&quot; between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken; the scenary chomping of Gary Oldman as Drexl, a role which utilizes Oldman's over-the-top hamming better than any other; Chris Penn and Tom Sizemore's quick, machine-gun interchanges as hotheaded narcs; and the hidden jewel, a young, lean James Gandolfini -- who hints at his future greatness here with a delivery that is both sadistic and human, humorous and scary, just like his immortal turn later as Tony Soprano.<br />The corniness of the romance is part of the character of this film, though when it reaches critical mass levels in one or two scenes (such as the airport scene, the &quot;what you did is so romantic&quot; scene, and the incredibly craven final -- and official -- ending), it's painful for me.  I kind of wish they could have kept the best elements from both the official and the deleted original ending (available here):  The toughness and character depth of the original ending but without the pretension, and the hope for redemption of the official ending.  Did they *really* need that last beach scene?  I don't think so.<br />But enough analysis (though the film deserves it).  True Romance is unique.  While not as uniformly great and ambitious as Reservoir Dogs, this film takes a lot of risks and enough of them pay off so that the flaws are easily forgiven.  And this double-disc rerelease's bonus materials, to me, are much more appealing than those of the recent Reservoir Dogs reissue.  A key film of the '90s, and to me, Quentin Tarantino's second most important contribution to cinema.
0451169514|5.0|Stephen King, he is the undisputed heavyweight champion of horror writers.  &quot;It&quot; does nothing to take away from him the crown he deserves.  Anytime I read a Stephen King novel, I am transfixed into an alternate reality that will usually leave me scared out of my gord.  &quot;It&quot; does this and more.  I don't really want to give away anymore of what happens, but I highly recommend this book and you will not be dissapointed.
0790729407|5.0|Digging back into their roots, director Neil Jordan and actor Liam Neeson have respectively delivered their most memorable and deep-cutting works to date.  Michael Collins has nagging flaws, but in the sweep of the passionate filmmaking and performances, all else is moot.  You will be carried forth by the conviction of the story.<br />Neeson was simply born to play this role.  An actor of tremendous power, Neeson is here given a role that's multi-dimensional enough for him to show his formidable chops.  The Michael Collins character is alternately a boyish, dashing ladykiller and a tactician with a steel will, and just watching Neeson tackle the character's inner and outer demons is worth the price of the movie.  He indeed projects the power and charisma of a great leader in his &quot;our refusal&quot; speech.  There's more -- Aidan Quinn gives his best performance as friend-turned-enemy Harry Boland; Alan Rickman utilizes his deadpan comic timing and hidden deviance to perfection as Eamon de Valera; Stephen Rea is great as usual as English traitor Ned Broy.  The one weak link is of course Julia Roberts, as Harry and Mick's love interest Kitty, with her bad Irish accent and vacant presence.  She's paralyzed by the scope of the historical drama and comes off stiff as a result, injecting the character with neither warmth nor power, and none of her signature girlish exuberance.  However, this was one case where the filmmaker's sacrifice of a character was to the benefit of the film.  In directing the film, Jordan sliced down Kitty's importance and makes her mostly a footnote; the result is that we are now free to interpret Mick and Harry's split as a philosophical and political one, rather than the ol' romantic triangle.  And for the better.<br />The cinematography is terrific, and the script ranks among my favourite of the '90s.  Jordan is deeply tapped into the behaviour and concerns of these characters, and he fills every minute with humour, danger, urgency, and personality.  The writing translates onto the screen beautifully, giving the audience an insight into not only the sociological scape of the film, but also the psychological.  And the pacing and editing never let up -- from the perfectly chosen &quot;in medias res&quot; opening to the brilliant &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; assassination montage.  <br />A great neglected classic.
B000065V9N|5.0|Peter Gabriel reached his high as an artist with this album.  This was the first CD I ever bought, and it still is in my top 10 of over 500 CDs.  &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; a great song which never dies is a highlight.  &quot;Don't Give Up&quot;  is incredible, Kate Bush sings background vocals that rival any background vocals I have ever encountered.  This CD will not let you down, you have to have a copy if you consider yourself a rock music fan anytime past 1980.  A must have!

Some may argue &quot;Thriller&quot; was the album of the decade, but I would cast my vote for &quot;The Joshua Tree.&quot;<br />Best Songs on the Disc:  (if you made me pick three)<br />1)  With or Without You<br />2)  I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For<br />3)  In God's Country<br />You cannot go wrong with this disc.  I highly recommend it.
B00005R87Q|4.0|Like him or hate him, Vin Diesel  carries himself well on screen and THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a tailor made vehicle (no pun intended) for him.  A simple plot (reminiscent and atmospheric as 1991's POINT BREAK with Patrick Swayse and Keanu Reeves) a street racer Dom, (Diesel) finances his hobby and his car \\"tune-up\\" garage with merchandise from hijacked trucks with the help of his gang of mechanics and drivers who ignore the law and love the fast lane.  An L.A. police officer Brian (Paul Walker) is sent undercover to pose as a prospective mechanic and driver for Dom's racing team and to expose the thieves.  One of the appeals of the film is the action of the car racing and car chases, all done with pure adrenalin rush. The action scenes work because they are not too over the top giving the audience a bit of plausibility.  Nice to see some fresh new faces on the movie screen and Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have good screen presence.  Overall, entertaining popcorn summer ...

0790729350|5.0|In a manner that must shock and amaze us all, this superb documentary catches the spirit and \\"geist\\" of the sixties counter-cultural movement like nothing else could. As a child of the sixties, and someone involved in all of the activities and social issues described herein, I find myself once again amazed whenever I catch this on TV, usually late at night.  For through the space of this seemingly endless concert film are the continuing threaded elements of a very important story, the epic tale of how a separate and distinct subculture in attempted to stand amidst the blaring hostile spotlights of an overbearing and dominating mainstream culture.<br />The parts of the movie I love watching best are not of the performers, but rather are the threads connecting them, the bits and pieces of extraneous events, conversations, and interactions that helped to flesh out the details of exactly what the social ethos of the counterculture were, and how they would inform, describe, and detail its members.  The first few minutes of the film, consisting of long and cinematically gorgeous shots of young \\"freaks\\" congregating to build the sound stage for the concert in an overgrown glen in upstate New York on tractors, horses, and in trucks and cars is breath-taking, and sets the stage for the kind of laid-back presentation that follows.<br />It is difficult to explain or to articulate what Woodstock meant, both to those of us who were lucky enough to be there and to the rest of us who experienced only vicariously through the countless stories and tales that emanated from it afterward, and from documentary evidence such as is provided by this film, that the so-called youth culture existed and thrived, by at least some 500,000 and most likely by many, many more freaks than that. For in truth reality was the coming of age of the youth movement in the same moment it became its funeral dirge, for the dominating mainstream culture recognized both its threat and its opportunity for them, in cultural and commercial terms, and the elements of the youth culture was quickly co-opted by advertising and business. Yet for all of that, what we had was a wonderful moment, however brief, in the warmth of togetherness in the sun. Watch the movie and celebrate. We've spent the last thirty years mourning our collective failure by letting the Woodstock in each of us die. Enjoy!em, in cultural and commercial terms, and the elements of the youth culture was quickly co-opted by advertising and business.

B00006AG5N|5.0|This collection of all of Elvis Number One songs is perfect for someone who is interested in having the best of his single releases. For those of us who grew up hearing these songs being played as the background to the movie of our everyday lives, each brings back some dusty memories; hitching a ride in a friends reworked '51 Ford and hearing \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" for the first time, or driving to Pennsylvania for my older sister's wedding and listening to \\"Don't be Cruel \\" as we hurtled down the highway. Yet much of this music came relatively later in his career, which is to say after he returned from the Army after a two year absence doing his patriotic duty.<br />So we have quite a mixture of different kinds of Elvis music, for what came after he returned was far less edgy and different than it had been before. Now he seemed to stick much more closely to a formulaic kind of song, much more main stream in songs like \\"Stuck On You, \\"Good Luck Charm\\", and \\"Return To Sender\\". Which isn't to say they were not good or that we didn't like them. But a lot of what he recorded in the 1963-67 timeframe was a lot like what everyone else was doing, or had been doing, in pop music.<br />Yet there are some innovative and impressive songs here, such as \\"It's Now Or Never\\", which was almost operatic in its delivery. This was a side of Elvis we had never recognized in any of his previous work, and he showed exactly how good a voice he had to work with. So we have quite a range here, from the early work like \\"Good Rocking Tonight\\", \\"Baby, Let's Play House\\", \\"All Shook Up\\", and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", as well as some softer and more mainstream work like \\"She's Not You\\", \\"Devil In Disguise', and \\"Suspicious Minds\\". Anyone giving a good listen to the range on this CD can see just what kind of musical legs this guy had. Enjoy!

B00006J9OT|5.0|This one took me by surprise. I loved her &quot;When I look into your Eyes&quot; CD but found her last effort &quot;the Look of Love&quot; to be a bit less than stellar (although still good).... it had a few nice songs but also some things that just didn't stay with me over time and thus found its way hidden in my stack of music. <br />This live CD just knocked my socks off. The same songs I liked on her last CD appear here with, in my opinion, FAR stronger arrangements. As an added bonus, she plays piano quite a bit more as well and there is less focus on the orchestra. Both &quot;Look of Love&quot; and &quot;S'Wonderful&quot; are just **outstanding** to the highest degree on the live CD, far far eclipsing the already decent versions on the studio CD preceeding this one. As for the others, not really a dud in the bunch. I've never had the luck to see Diana Krall live, but after hearing this one, I sure wish to hell I had. The &quot;studio&quot; track of Billy Joels classic &quot;Just the way you are&quot; that she stuck onto the CD ain't bad either, and seeing how often I've heard that song that is saying something.<br />Bottom line: Highly, highly recommended, especially for those of you who thought her last effort missed some of the feel of her earlier work. Recording quality is quite nice and natural too; maybe not up to the studio stuff, but definitely the usual high standards from Schmitt, LiPuma and mastering engineer Doug Sax.
B00006DEF9|5.0|The freqently used quote &quot;They don't make movies like this anymore&quot; truthfully applies to this classic. It really is classic Hollywood and you will never find another experience like it in the whole of the motion picture history. <BR>The shear simplicity of the story and the wasy it unfoldes in a true tribute to the genius of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. How they could pull off the movie this well is amazing because it seems impossible. The script is exceptional with great on-liners in both love and comedy being thrown from everywhere and everyone in the film.<BR>The acting is nothing short of brilliant as well. Which is a suprise considering this is a musical and the satrs are usually picked for their ability to sing and dance. Kelly is great to watch as high-roller movie star Don Lockwood, whilst Donald O'Conner is equally as good as his best friend Cosmo Brown. Debbie Reynolds does well as the subborn dame Kathy Seldon but the real credit must go to Jean Hagen who is exceptional as Lina Lamont. She makes you feel sympathetic for but at the same repulsed by her chractor. The voice change is dramatic and I think it shows the true story with alot of silent film with not exactly glamourous voices. <BR>Anyone who has seen this movie would say that the songs are the true stars of the movie and it's true. Still with so much hype surrounding them nowdays they still do not dissapoint even veteran viewers. &quot;Singin'In The Rain&quot; is the obvious choice for most memorable. It's the number that everybody knows and can sing along to. &quot;Good Morning&quot; is another classic with an absolutly outstanding extended dance sequence from the three main stars. O' Conner's number &quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot; is a riot with the agile star doing just about everything you though was possible....and then some, with his face and body. The highlight of the film for me was the &quot;Moses&quot; song and dance from O'Conner and Kelly inside the diction coaches office. It isa delight to watch and will be sure to have you grinning for hours afterwards. And no musical would be complete without a handfull of ballards which get the emotions flowing, and the love songs here do just that.<BR>Overall, &quot;Singin' In The Rain&quot; should be a must for your collection. <BR>Please Note: It was voted #10 on the AFI's list of the hundred greatest American movies ever.
0316666343|5.0|It's refreshing when you can pick up a good piece of fiction that is WELL WRITTEN!  I love the perspective -- very original and unique.  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something different to read.  Even though it is fiction, it is highly believable and well told.  Great characters.  Though it may seem like a sad and morbid subject, the writer doesn't let us dwell on the dark side.  If I thought this were a depressing story, I would have put it down well before finishing it.  So fear not!<BR>I am not a religious person, but it certainly made me think about the whole concept of Heaven.  It also made the possibility of communicating with those gone to Heaven seem quite possible --on a very  personal level, of course.
B000065V41|2.0|This film is one of the Christmas classics and a favorite of our whole family's.  The film deserves \\"5-stars.\\"  However, Disney chose to release \\"pan-and-scan\\" only for the DVD.  Since pan-and-scan chops off the sides so that the movie is the same aspect ratio as a standard TV, we're only seeing half of the film.  Therefore, I can give this \\"VHS with chapter stops\\" version of the film no more than two stars.<br />Disney should be ashamed of themselves, ... ruining such a wonderful film with a sub-par DVD release.  I was really looking forward to seeing this film as it was seen in the theaters (i.e. in WIDESCREEN).  Maybe another year.<br />Perhaps Disney is letting art imitate life.  Perhaps, ... just perhaps, ... they will turn over a new leaf like Ebeneezer Scrooge and start releasing films in their Original Aspect Ratio!!<br />We can only dream.

Yes,the collection of Martin Lewis interviews with everyone from Director Dick Lester,Sir George Martin,film co-stars like,John Junkin, Anna Quayle & Jeremy Lloyd,photographer Robert Freeman,and even Klaus Voorman,are a lot of fun,and shed some interesting and fresh perspectives.( And all these people look remarkably well.).But,that's all we get: new interviews. No real \\"new\\" material from the vaults,and not nearly enough Victor Spinetti!<br />What is missing: \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" the original proposed intro.montage.( As re-inserted in the 25th Anniversary theatrical re-release,and included on the video version. ). The original film trailer. ( Also included on previous releases.)And most annoyingly,a 5 minute deleted scene featuring Paul talking to an actress.( Referred to numerous times by several of the interviewees! ). Including the \\"Standing,Sitting,Jumping Up & Down\\" film,would also have been nice,since it technically inspired Dick Lester's vision for \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".( Especially since we are teased with exerpts,through out the interviews with Dick Lester.)<br />This DVD set is a nice addition for any Beatle fan's collection,but be fore-warned,it's not quite as complete as it should've been.

I &quot;borrowed&quot; the copy belonging to my brother, and have never been without a copy since then.<br />The information contained within is aimed at surviving in the most extreme conditions.  Granted, not many of us will be stranded in the North Pole - but if we were, we'd know not to eat a polar bear's liver, because the amount of vitamin A contained therein is toxic!  <BR>More usable information includes:<br />- Beautiful, accurate pictures of edible and poisonous plants<BR>- How-to advice on setting up temporary camps<BR>- Basic first aid and medical care<BR>- How to survive a nuclear attack, war conditions, fire/ice/extreme weather conditions<BR>- A virtually complete instruction on how to set up different traps to catch your food,<BR>And other amazing pieces of information simply too numerous to list.<br />All in all, there are probably more professional, intensive survival guides - but this is by far one of the more approachable, with common sense advice that we can use even in a non-survival situation.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Trust me...I hated Alanis for YEARS before I heard this record. I thought she was the biggest fabricated Sinead O-Connorwannabe industry blow-up doll ever SEEN. BUT...that all changed the first time I heard \\"Thank You...\\" on the radio. Instinctively, I knew those lyrics and that incredible melody had come from a very real place. I know the song was not a major hit for her (which further indicates that it is truly GREAT and above the heads of the mediocre masses), but I rushed out and bought the album and was blown smack off my previous high horse and converted to the cult of Alanis. Never thought it would happen. Not in a million years. Seriously, I was one of those who thought about launching an anti-Alanis website...I thought she was THAT phony. But I was wrong, and this album proved me wrong. Astonishingly original, achingly personal, deliciously experimental, and HONEST. She didn't have to make an album like this; in fact, I'm certain her label probably sweated bullets. But she proved herself as a vocalist, as an artist. I think it's a gorgeous record in every way. Tracks like \\"Thank You\\" \\"That I would Be Good\\" \\"So Pure\\" and, especially, \\"Joining You\\" rank as some of the best female pop-rock of the 90's. Yes, I bought her next two (the Unplugged and the Rug Swept album) but neither of them, while good, hold a candle to this great piece of artistry. I still do not own Jagged and will never purchase it (cause I think it was a total phony album) but this record was as REAL as Jagged was NOT. Five BIG Stars. P.S. Want a great album recommendation to listen to now? Buy Sinead O'Connor's new one called 'Sean-nos Nua'...it will raise the hair on the back of your neck and lull you into ... wonderland.

B00005AQF7|5.0|I Love This CD. This is Snoop Dogg at his very best. All of the tracks except are brilliant. Dre's production and Snoop's rapping are such a fantastic combo. Murder Was The Case is a great track where Snoop's rapping about his trial situation and he goes really deep. My personal fave is Who Am I. The beat is one of the best I have ever heard and was the key factor which resulted in me getting this album. On Serial Killer, you hear RBX at his best with his raspy stop-start flow. Much like the Chronic, the subject matter is mainly gangster, but i personally prefer this album. A definite classic.
B000023VR6|4.0|After the long antipated wait Dre has finally released 2001. The lyrics are better than the chronic. For example The Watcher is where Dre explores how rap has changed and on What's The Difference, Eminem and Xzibit are brilliant. It could've done without the skits though except for Eddie Griffen. Other great tracks are The Message, which is a tribute to his brother, my favourite track, Forgot About Dre, The Next Episode(Too short though). Only reason it has 4 stars is that the album declines a bit towards the end and a couple of tracks could've been excluded. However this album is great and the production shows why Dre is the best producer.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|No interviews with any of the voice talent that helped make the film timeless... Disapponting because I would love to have heard from them too. All I saw was Celene Dion....<br />The making of... shows how much work had gone into making Beauty and the Beast.<br />I am glad that there are games for everyone to enjoy. You also get 3 versions of the film... A Special Edition With a new scene added in, The Original 1991 version that was released to theaters, and the work in progress version of the film.<br />NOTE: It is in widescreen... The restoration blows the mind and words can't even begin to tell you just how beautiful the movie now looks. It makes you see this film in a new way...
B000059XYK|1.0|It might occur to you that i didn't like this film a lot.<br />What's happened here is called \\"completely missing the point.\\"<br />This is a remake for which there was even less need than there is for most remakes.<br />The original film isn't much, and, in objective cinematic terms, it's not very good.  Technical production values are abysmal, and the acting is worse.<br />Despite that, the original succeeds admirably at what it set out to do -- wreck a lot of cars and show a clever crook Getting Away With It.  And showcase some Incredible stunt driving -- the final stunt is unbelievable.  And it's real.<br />Right off the bat, the remake suffers because someone decided that the hero couldn't be Only In It For The Money, so we get the ridiculous plot gimmick of his being blackmailed back into crime after going straight.  This one can work, but it takes a slight amount of intelligence to make it work.  And that sin't on display here.<br />Next mistake was to decide that the film needed a Plot.  And a Love Interest.  Only plot this story needs is \\"got to steal 'X' cars by Tuesday and we can't find one of them.\\"  Again -- for the money, not becuase he's nobly risking his own life and freedom to save his brother.<br />Third mistake is introducing an Evial Villain.  Not needed.<br />Fourth mistake is making the hard-to-find car something exotic and rare; in the original film, the Mustang Mach One they were trying to find seemed to be, at the time, nearly as common as VW Beetles, and not being able to find one was a running gag. (I remember the period -- i didn't go a day without seeing one or two.)<br />Fifth mistake is not using a real one, anyway.  The car in the film is a fibreglass body which sort of resembles the GT500 it's supposed to be -- or rather, looks like what a GT500 would have looked like if the original designer had had the good taste to consult this film's art director.<br />Sixth mistake is the fact that -- even if it were real -- the car isn't nearly original anymore, and anyone who specified a specific year of GT500 is going to want Original.  The paint is nothing like the original, and it's fitted with a nitrous system -- putting something like that on a 427 side oiler in the degree of build-up that Ol' Shel and his gnomes put into the GT500 is inviting an under-hood explosion.<br />Seventh Solecism is that, even if it looked real, and even if it looked original, the car either has Chrysler running gear under it, or the sound men used the sound of a Chrysler-powered vehicle (a number of people have identified the sound of the starter as being a Chizzler product.)<br />Eigth Error is that they spend more time on their idiot plot than they do on the Chase.  And that's exactly backward of what made the original film so good.  And the chase they do sort of show is made up of isolated and un-connected stunts that don't gel together as a chase.<br />And the Ninth and Biggest Horrible Thing is faking The Jump.  Given the apparent location and setup of The Sort Of Jump in this film, i'm sure it either had to be wholly or partially faked with CGI or else was done with an empty car.<br />In the original, Halicki himself actually rode that thing, jumping it high over four \\"wrecked\\" cars in the middle of the road.  As we watch it in slow motion, we can see the whole body of the car flex and twist as it hits the ground, see the tires spinning and burning as he fights for control...<br />In this \\"remake\\", we sort of see what's maybe a car fly through the air in a shot that really doesn't give us a very good view.<br />Pass this up; watch the original.<br />It's sad -- if they had done anything like a real remake, Cage would have been perfect for the part.<br />Oh, well.  At least the original is available.original anymore, and anyone who specified a specific year of GT500 is going to want Original.

B00005OAIE|1.0|...He writes sub-standard \\"been there, done that\\" singer/songwriter pop that seems to be all the rage these days. As a solo act, Mayer had something interesting going with his music but his arangements on here are terrible at best. The music is tired, dull, and like I said before, treading on familar ground...
B00006AW2O|3.0|12x5: In which The Stones' U.S. record company (taking Capitol's then-current hatchet job of The Beatles' discography as some sort of twisted, greed-inspired cue) milks Mick &amp; Co. for all they were worth (striking while the iron was hot, and all that) by chopping up their UK albums into little red, white, and blue pieces for optimum profitabilty, artistic integrity be damned.  Whatever -- it was the early-sixties, after all, and no one thought these long-haired hooligans would turn into Icons.  But my question today is this:  why not release the original UK sources (&quot;Five by Five&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stones no.2&quot;) as part of the new remaster series, thereby settling a score of sorts with history?  Just a thought....
B00005A46T|3.0|Though Slipnot is known by fans for their heavy grunge sound, it's the melodic side of the band that sucks me in every time. <br />Nonetheless, much of \\"Iowa\\" is a heavy grind-fest.  If mom and dad didn't like your Nickelback records, you can forget about them liking this one!!

0553106635|3.0|Though not cerebral fantasy, the Fire and Ice series is, nevertheless, the most exciting and well-written series I can remember.  I can't remember ENJOYING fantasy this much, and it's my favorite genre.<br />That said, if you have read the first two books, and are not enthralled and &quot;sold&quot; on the series, don't expect Storm of Swords to draw you back in.  The least good of the three so far, Storm has a tendency -- not found in either of the first two-- to stall the characters in their tracks.  While the first two books really flew, characters (I love) like Arya and Bran and Caetlin and Sansa (and the rest) tend in this book just to repeat their mantras, both in dialogue and in plot.  Ten page chapters seem to exist to make one plot point.  A new character, Dantos, gets his own chapters, which are all fairly boring and repetitive:  he must be saved for some future plot twists.  The character of Daenarys, who went through a fascinating coming-of-age-as-a-woman plot in the first book, is now incredibly tedious.  Martin says in his dedication that his wife made him &quot;put the dragons in&quot; and I can only guess he doesn't have any ideas of what to do with them, at least in this installment.<br />So if you're hooked like I am, enjoy the book and let's hope for a return to form in the 4th installment.  If you're considering giving up after #2, then I expect Storm won't win you back.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Everyone I know have this movie in their collection, so I decided to get this movie. It is funny and the story keeps you interested. The aninmation is excellent. I watched it with my neice and nephew and they enjoyed it as much as I did. The games on the DVD are also good.
B000002GGO|5.0|The first time I heard Waterfront (listening to KROQ while on vacation in Orange county back in 1984) two things became very clear to me...one, that Sparkle in the Rain was a must-own album and two, that it would be years before Portland, Oregon would ever have a radio station as cool as KROQ (actually, it took twelve years)
B00003CXXI|5.0|This is a wonderful family movie with lots of laughs, action, great animation, cool soundtrack, and so much fun! Buy this movie and love it! This is a wonderful movie.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Okay, I have to admit, I have never read any of the Harry Potter books and the only reason why I agreed to see this movie was for my niece who is a huge fan of the books. Now while the film has some nifty special effects, the storyline is too slow and the film is aimed for a smaller audience. I wasn't a fan of the books and this film won't make me buy one anytime soon. If your children must see this video then watch it only if the books are interesting for you. If you havn't read any of the books, simply let your children watch it while you pick up a good book to read, like The Lord of the Rings!
B000007R0S|5.0|This was a very plesant surprise - it sounds soooo good, much better than on the original almbums.
B00005JKZT|5.0|...that they will have this AMAZING scene included for it truly shows a huge step in Aragorn shedding his reluctance to accept his role as the King of Gondor. Plus it would be fantastic visually if done right. Picture this in the film if you can; At night & alone Aragorn taking his rightful possession of one of the Palantir (one of the Seeing Stones) and revealing to the flaming, lidless Eye Of Sauron his lineage & the reforged sword Narsil, the very same sword that his ancestor Isildur used to cut Sauron's fingers off along with the One Ring thousands of years ago! Ahhhh....A close up of Aragorn's face in the moonlight, confident with maybe even a slight smirk as if saying, \\"That's right! You want some more of this?\\" And then you see The Eye again up close along with that noise like a tempest mingled with fire.... and the pupil suddenly opens wide with recognition and fear.....<BR>I don't remember if this scene is in The Two Towers or The Return Of The King, but I really hope that Peter Jackson includes it because it would be oh so SWEET!!! Bring on December 18th!
B000065V42|1.0|The movie - 5 stars, the DVD - not even 1 star! The only things good are the OK film quality and it's in surround sound and not just stereo. The DVD has no features, and when I say that, I mean NO features...not even a trailer! It doesn't even have the Roger Rabbit \\"Tummy Trouble\\" cartoon that came with the VHS! It's not in Widescreen (and it WAS in theaters, I remember). You would think that a movie with great special effects (for it's time) would have a making of featurette. Disney had it's chance to finally show us how the movie was done, and they destroy it. I am fed up with Disney. This movie was huge when it came out in 1989, and Disney does this to it. I still picked it up (along with the 2 awesome sequels) because I know that Disney will never wise up to their classics, they just want to destroy them with making sequels to them (Cinderella, Lady & The Tramp). The Beauty & The Beast DVD is awesome though, who knows, maybe there's hope for Disney DVD yet, but not for Honey I Shrunk the Kids. I recommend buying this DVD ONLY if you are a huge fan of the trilogy. We've waited too long for it, and Disney shorts us. I'm glad I only paid [price] each for mine, a penny above that, and I would have walked away.
B00000342V|5.0|Movies are the ultimate team effort in the art world.  Most of the parts (script, acting, camera, music) can do it's job correctly, but if one fails badly, the whole project suffers.  Conversely, if one part shines above all others, it can lift the movie almost by itself.  <br />I can't think of a better example of this than the soundtrack for the movie \\"Superfly\\".  Some people like the movie because it shows how an individual can win against \\"The Man\\".  I find it an average movie at best that sends the message that the way out of poverty is to deal drugs.  If it weren't for the soundtrack, this movie would have long disappeared from memory.  <br />But what a soundtrack it was!  With a successful career going already, Curis Mayfield reaches his commercial zenith with an astonishingly good compilation of music that perfectly captures the world the movie portrays.  From the opening epic \\"Little Child Runnin' Wild\\", Mayfield takes us on a journey where there aren't too many bright spots.  <br />There were some hits off the album with \\"Freddie's Dead\\" and the title song.  But it's a lot deeper than that.  \\"Little Child Runnin' Wild\\" articulately sets the stage for the choices many in this environment are confronted with.  Often the \\"easy\\" choice turns out to be the disastrous one.  And it takes off from there, with many songs being very innovative for their time.  It also has one of the most beautiful instrumentals of all time in \\"Think\\", which somehow makes you do just that.<br />The fact that the music still holds up thirty years later is a testament to it's genius.
0345410025|4.0|This classic by Lorayne and Lucas is worthy of recommendation to any new student of memory systems.  I do, however, wish that the authors had covered the power of the Loci system with greater detail.  It is utilized by world-class memorizers to set new records in memory competitions.   And the system I employed to set a new U.S. record in card memorization cannot even be found in this book.  All the other memory systems and techniques explained by Lorayne and Lucas are excellent.  In my opinion, as long as this book is not the only memory guide in your library, it will serve you very well.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|On a first listening of Ryan Adams' Gold and even subsequent listenings, striking influences are apparent - Van Morrison, Lou Reed, Neil Young, The Rolling Stones, Johnny Cash, etc.  Remarkably, even with those obvious influences, Adams manages to create a sound and style of his own.  Even more remarkable are the lyrics.  Presented subtlely and with nuance, they are strong and poetic.  Adams attacks subjects of our modern world, making timelss themes relevant to our time.  As a representative of Lost Highway Records, Adams fits right in with heavyweight lyricists, Lucinda Williams and Ron Sexsmith.<BR>The lyrics are supported by fairly traditional rock instrumentation:  acousitc and electric guitar, bass, drums, and piano and a few others mixed in.  The band moves smoothly between the changes in Adams' songs, hitting nice grooves and maneuvering builds quitely effectively.<BR>Placing an upside down American flag as the backdrop to the \\"pop-looking\\" Adams, the cover is a great summation of the Americana and pop culture represented on this CD.  The impression is much in the vein of a young Elvis Presely or James Dean - cool, sexy, and rebellious.  Just as the photo is a rich expression of popular Americana, so is Gold.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the most impressive display of historical events that occured during WWII to these soldiers.

B00004Y62T|5.0|There are a lot of people who, liking this film, have already reviewed this film stylishly at length, so I won't try to match that. What I will say is that if you don't like this film it must be because it isn't your SORT of film. Maybe you need car chases and your films to have no worrying homosexual themes running through them. I can see how Jock Quarterback from Kansas might have a problem with liking this film. It is anyway, a beautiful and disturbing two and a half hours.
B000002IZ4|5.0|STP's debut album Core smashed onto the charts in 1992 with the typical grunge feel, bringing an unrelenting heaviness with it in both the instruments and Scott Weiland's voice. If that album were to be judged alone, no doubt it would still be catching flak for ripping off Nirvana. However, the second album, Purple, took STP in a whole new direction for the better. It is very difficult to determine which album between Purple and Core is better, as both exhibit well crafted tracks and gifted songwriting skills, with a great ability to mix aggressive heaviness with infectious melody and catchy hooks that no listener will forget. The real standout from Purple is that the band found new ways to use their instruments than they had found on Core.<br />Dean DeLeo's guitar playing has grown from more than slamming power chords, although don't get me wrong, he is amazing at that, to more complex riffing, more impressive solos, and now more acoustic melodies across the album. The rhythm section has also taken on more diversity than from Core and Weiland's lyrics have become slightly more profound.<br />Purple spawned some of STP's best known singles and completely broke them through after the success of Core. Fans of the older sound are satisfied again and again as the heaviness is still there, with both &quot;Meatplow&quot; and &quot;Unglued&quot; sounding like outtakes from Core. The singles released were fresher material for the fan waiting for a new twist in the music, as &quot;Vasoline&quot; showed a trademark heavy STP riff, &quot;Big Empty&quot; caught the mellow yet crunching side with its slide solos, and &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot; became one of the most well-known songs of the 90's, not to mention one of the catchiest and best rock songs ever written. Other than the singles, the album has a lot more to offer, particularly &quot;Lounge Fly&quot;, which has a very strange feel to it, &quot;Still Remains&quot; as it is one of the best tracks on the album, and &quot;Kitchenware &amp; Candybars&quot;, starting off as a mellow acoustic number and raging into a melodic distortion attack.<br />Both Purple and Core are worthy of your money, and although the rest of STP's work are good rock records, the sound will never be the same as their first two releases. I reccommend them both on equal levels, as they both have their listening advantages. You just can't top Weiland's odd and somehow disturbing lyrics.
B00004SVIK|5.0|If you ever wondered what THE WALL sounded like live well look on further.  This double disc album contains 2 new songs that were not on the studio album.  Even though this cd was recorded in 1980-1981 you would expect to have a some what muffled soud right?  WRONG!  This cd sounds better then some of the newer live albums out there(Ozzy).  So if you are a old Floyd fan or a new one you should pick up the cd it is worth every red cent.
0380002930|5.0|This book is the story of a party of young travelers who flee their doomed homeland, seeking to establish a new home for themselves.  The characters, are, as you've probabally heard by now, wild rabbits, but unlike most novels about animals, this one avoids the traps of sentimentality and anthropomorphism.  The rabbits are taken seriously as characters - they have a well-developed culture and mythology and a distinctly lapine psychology.  Mr. Adams did his homework for this one, and the result is a very interesting blend of rabbit lore and human athropology - some of the best parts of the book are the stories the rabbits tell of their culture hero El-ahrairah.  No twee, Redwall-esque bunnies here, no sir.<br />This book is one of my favorites; I read it once every couple of years, and it never looses it's charm.  Highly reccomended.
0898705525|5.0|The Romance Of Faith.  Like any real romance, this book about faith can be peeled back in each reading to reveal a deeper and richer truth.  With witty voice (I know it's not an audio book -- but you can almost hear him) Chesterton shows us that God doesn't fit into anyone's box -- and that true faith is the most exciting &amp; perilous thing of all.  To truly believe leads us to truly live.  For years this has been my favorite book -- and one which shows the richness and jolly goodness of faith.<br />One caveat -- must smoke a pipe while reading in order to fully appreciate book.
B00004XOWN|1.0|What astounds me is that Three Dollar Bill is so ... good, but Significant Other is so mediocre and Limp (more Fred than anything) decides to follow that mediocrity with an even [worse] CD! For one, the melodies and notes are too disjointed to sound proper, he tries to maintain this tough-guy image with hard and drawn-out riffs with rough vocals and also (for some odd reason) this sensitive guy image ... where he tries somehow to mix melodic soft singing with his completely inept singing voice... (...buy the CD just to cringe over his obnoxiously horrible vocals...)<BR>  He's making himself into what he used to hate: a fake.  ...
B00003CXA2|4.0|Of course you know what you're gonna get, chocolate, duh! Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career as \\"Forrest Gump.\\" The director, Robert Zemeckis was creative and brilliant with his vision. It's about a slow-minded man who did everything. Ran away from bullies, fought in Vietnam, got shot in the but-tocks, met the president, played ping-pong, ran some more (this time around the country) and ate shrimp. Yes, what a life. And then he finally got Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and had a little Forrest. You could tell by a person's shoes what kind of a life they had. If you look at my shoes, you'll see dirt and dog stuff all over them. What does that mean?

B0000640VO|5.0|On top of the second review, Au-desla des mots! This film will be highly appreciated by those who share a close resemblance to any characters captured in Amelie.  If you're too ignorant to bother with subtitled foreign films that require some added attention and intelligence--maybe you should stick to Disney's, The Little Mermaid.

With 'A Rush of Blood to the Head' the band have moved on from the made-for-export Brit-rock 'Englishness' of 'Yellow' and have produced 11 tracks that have abandoned catchy, poppy one-liners for a striking and raw soulfulness modern rock hasn't seen since the early days of U2.  Big words?  Listen from track one to eleven and you immediately get the impression that this album spent more time being developed and bounced around between the band members on the studio floor than being fixed up on the switches and sliders of a high-tech mixing board.  Like their Scot-rock cousins, Travis, Coldplay's lyrics tend to be simple, straightforward, rock clichE even.  Chris Martin's delivery, however, is fresh and volatile - carefully weaving melancholy falsetto through the music as opposed to stomping on top of it (They were all ye-lloh.)  With `A Rush of Blood to the HeadEColdplay have created a solid, beautiful, and cohesive follow-up album in an industry where second-albums are always a shaky bet.
B000068IEU|2.0|My folks wouldn't let me go to see this when it first came out, so I finally got my chance.  I can't say that I liked it and I certainly can't say that I enjoyed it.  The acting is atrocious.  The production values put it on the same level as a filmed-in-a-basement-apartment '70s porn film. (Not that I've ever seen one!) It alternates between being deathly dull and repulsively violent.  A curiosity at best.
0440237688|1.0|When my 7th grader was reading the Giver and said the book was very strange, I picked it up myself to read. It is a strange<BR>book that is very sad, dark and about a society of people that does not experience life as it really is, but experiences life in a controlled way. There is no pain, love or self expression. The old are sent to the house of old to live until death, never to embrace grandchildren. The weakest in the community are \\"released\\" which means they are murdered. The scene in the book where the youngest twin (twins aren't allowed)is injected with a lethal injection,goes thru spasms, then goes limp and dies is ultra sad for anyone to read, let alone a young reader. The law doesn't apply to this community. What exactly is the books value to our children and what lessons are they learning?
1559408898|5.0|I can't believe how perfect this movie is. The Criterion Collection version of Robocop is one of the DVDs that I couldn't live without. The audio commentary is actually pretty interesting also.
B0000073AD|4.0|For those who still associate Maggie Reilly's voice too much with Mike Oldfield's 80ties stuff, this album may well be the answer. It's her first solo recording and probably not her best, as most songs were written for her by other people, probably in a commercial aim and may sound a bit poppish (but her voice is a great that we can forgive her for this aspect of the album). Yet a few the tunes (Echoes, Gaia, Everytime we touch) come from MR herself and her long friend Stuart McKillop, and are amongst the nicest on the album. On the whole, a good album, a good introduction to her latest ones, especially Starcrossed which is very next to perfection !
0767802659|5.0|Everything in the movie that people complain about was intentional. The bad acting, the obsurdity of the military tactics, the cheasy dialogue. And lets face it. The book that it is based on was pretty boring. Lighten up! I would however have to say that this movie does not quite stand up to the utter perfection of the Criterion Collection version of Robocop.
B00003CXI1|1.0|This was a very terrible movie.After a bunch of horrible books,out comes a horrible movie from the Harry Potter series.I will not watch this junk,will not support this junk,and will not stand this junk.If you like to watch good movies,then this movie is definitely not for you.However,if you enjoy completely awful movies,then be sure to add Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone to your DVD(or video)collection.<br />Peace Out.

B00004TLN3|3.0|This adaptation is in keeping with the book (not Jane Austen's greatest: she died before editing it and it got pulished posthumusly). Although you will not drool over Peter Firth like some are wont to do over another Firth (Colin of course!), you'll find the acting to be quite decent. My only real criticism goes to the appalling score: it seems to be competing for attention with the script instead of serving it!<BR>It's definitely worth watching, but you won't find yourself compelled to sit through numerous viewings, P&P it's not!
0553278223|5.0|This book is very scary and that is why I like it. I read this book when I was 17 years old.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I'm a big Linkin Park fan and I'm always looking for new music to listen to that can compare to the sound of Linkin Park. While the sound of 30STM can't really compare to LP, the sound is tremendously atmospheric, and leads you away from your troubles, sort of like trance music literally puts you in a trance. 30STM has an Orgyesque sound, and I'm an Orgy fan. Their first single, \\"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\\" is an awesome blend of synths and hard guitar riffs. The sound will literally pull you into another dimension. Another songs on the album like \\"Echelon\\" and \\"Edge Of The Earth\\" will also pull you off of the Earth and into another place. The sound of 30STM will not only please your ears, but will make you forget all your cares.
B00005JKWJ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first \\"Blade,\\" and looked forward to the sequel, hoping for a mix of pretty aesthetics, good fight choreography, and mindless action. Well, it had \\"mindless\\" pretty well covered, but the rest was absent. Don't get me wrong - I love campy movies, brain bubblegum, and vampire movies in general; still, even with my deep love of film, I just couldn't get over how bad this movie was. Given the other reviewers' high ratings, perhaps my boyfriend and I missed something crucial here, but by and large, this movie is a groaner that doesn't quite attain what it seems to be reaching for (perhaps \\"The Matrix\\" meets \\"From Dusk til Dawn.)<br />The director (who also directed the truly bad \\"Mimic\\") pretty much took \\"Mimic\\" and made it a vampire movie - it was kind of like \\"Mimic\\" meets \\"Tekken\\" meets [insert bad vampire movie here.] While many of the fights were well-choreographed, they just didn't know when to stop - there are fight sequences that last 3- to 4-times longer than their entertainment value, and it's more than obvious that the actors are on wires too many times. Unlike \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\\" the wire work just isn't well-done in this movie. Overall, the fights themselves aren't as carefully done, either, and attention to the finishing details was pretty much absent. If you like gratuitous, unending fight scenes, though, this may work well for you. Heck, I even like Kung-Fu movies, and I thought this was over-the-top.<br />The computer-generated images were not very good, and lacked many of the important finishing careful touches that really make modern CG so beautiful. The story as written was ludicrous and also overdone, although the concepts behind it could have been develped into something extraordinary. The acting ventured into the melodramatic, as did much of the direction.<br />The first half of the movie was amusing, but the second half was sheer torture. I am by no means squeamish or averse to violence in movies, but the gratuitous violence and gore went beyond \\"shock value\\" and into \\"insane;\\" at some point it just gets to be mind-numbing. The dialogue was laughable, and at one point, this line is actually spoken (I swear I am not making this up:)<br />\\"Where are we?\\"<BR>\\"Some kind of chamber, deep within their lair.\\"<br />No really; \\"deep within their *lair*!!\\" Kris Kristofferson actually says that. Honestly. Couple that with the angst-ridden reaper running through gothic halls wailing \\"FAAAATHERRRRR!\\" in an out-of-place scene, and the overblown, romanticized, slow-motion death sequence of a main character, and you've got a recipe for ridiculousness. The entire audience was snickering for most of the last half of the show, and not in a good way.<br />The only bright spot in the film is Leonor Varela, who brings not only beauty, but real acting talent to bear. I hope she'll find a script with some substance to show us what she can really do. Luke Goss did a good job as the lead bad guy where the script actually let him, and I think he would also do well in a movie with a basic grasp of the elements of good storytelling.<br />Overall, I found it hugely disappointing. If I had gone in expecting sheer gratuitous campy BS, I might not have minded it, but the first film upped my expectations a bit. However, if you really enjoyed all of the aspects of \\"Mimic\\" (and not just that some of it was very pretty,) you may like \\"Blade II.\\" Perhaps if there is a third \\"Blade,\\" they will look back to the original for inspiration, and figure out why the first one worked, and why this one does not.<br />The features on the DVD aren't anything to write home about, but there are interesting tidbits.
B00006I9HJ|5.0|In spite of what music critics often have to say about Nada Surf, fans worldwide seem to be of one opinion - that the band only gets better and better with each release. This album is most definitely NS on top of their game. It has elements of High/Low, The Proximity Effect, and even influences from the b-side material found on the rather-more-rare North 6th Street (a Nada-fan Essential). All these blend well, and are carried into newer and higher plateaus with the widely ranging emotion and musicality of Let Go. Standout Tracks include all three of the bonus tracks and on the Album 'Proper' Fruit Fly, Hi-Speed Soul, Killian's Red, and Paper Boats (perhaps the album's best song, it's truly beautiful).<br />Reviewers have been kind to Nada Surf this time, and rightly so. It's about time their greatness was recognized. I ordered this album from Amazon.fr, and I'm glad I didn't wait. I can only hope the Barsuk release in January catapults Nada Surf back into the public eye, because they most certainly deserve it for producing the best album of this year (and possibly next).
B00005QGAZ|5.0|The biggest selling album of all time<br />What else do I have to say
B0000028SU|5.0|I just got the CD yesterday and it ROCKS! I don't know why, (maybe because I was &quot;mad&quot; at Bruce for not being with the band) but I never did pick this up when it came out. Now that I'm gearing up for yet another Bruce concert, I figured I'd add this to my repertoire! I fell in love with the first notes! No lie! Love &quot;Better Days&quot; and &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; This album reflects the love and happiness (the early infatuation days) with Patti and I'm so happy that Bruce found happiness after Julianne and the whole Tunnel of Love album....that was a downer album, but some fantastic songs came from that period of his life. Lucky Town is upbeat and as a previous reviewer said, one to roll down the windows to and cranked up loudly...and let the wind blow back your hair! One of his best!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink, who last year was probably conseved as another biker chick wannabe 'boy hater', but really, on her sophmore effort \\"Missundaztodd\\", she totally blows that idea out of the water. With Linda Perry (Three Non Blondes) alongside her and some new found singing talent, obvisouly, Pink has matured greatly and shown the world who she really is. The first radio single, \\"Get The Party Started\\" is a fun-loving pop dance tune that i found is probably one of the best party openers ever (I DJ alot of partys). Some, however, after hearing \\"Get The Party Started\\" might have thought Pink just changed her hair color, they were obvisouly shown up on her second radio single \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" which shows her not only personal side but reflects on some very strong opions. \\"i'm so tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears/she's so pretty/that just ain't me\\" is one of the lines from \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" that caught quite a few people's ears. Pink, i believe, not only has WAY more talent than Britney Spears, but actually looks pretty good as well. If you take a sidetrack off the radio singles, you will notice some very different kinds of pop anthems on the album besides \\"Get The Party Started\\". Some of those are the corky pop album opener \\"Missundaztood\\", the base heavy power anthems \\"Respect\\" and \\"18 Wheeler\\", the very slowly influenced \\"Going To Calfornia\\", and the more upbeat power tune \\"My Vietnam\\" which ends the album. <br />Turning back to the singles, \\"Just Like A Pill\\", the 3rd single off the album, is brilliant. With its very base heavy background and Pink's gritty lyrics \\"i can't stay on your life support/there's a shortage in the switch/i can't stay on your morphine/cause it's makin me itch/i said i tried to call the nurse again/but she's being a little...\\", you should definitely find this an intreeging number. The latest and most personal of not only the singles but all the album, \\"Family Potrait\\" is definitely worth a listen. Pink's disturbed perspective of herself living in 'Word War 3' as a child makes a very good song. <br />Other big points off the radio single path are the downbeat \\"Misery\\" with Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, the very addictive \\"Dear Diary\\", and the Linda Perry duet are all worth listening to. <br />All in all, expect some huge differences from this album and Pink's debut, \\"Can't Take Me Home\\". If your a fan of that album and songs like \\"There U Go\\", \\"Most Girls\\", and \\"You Make Me Sick\\" i would suggest finding another cocky female r&b vocalast, because Pink obvisouly doesn't do that anymore.

B000002BFZ|1.0|I love PJ, but here's the truth about &quot;No Code&quot;...  First the positives:  The concept is facsinating and the packaging is the most impressive of any CD I've seen -- The fold-out case even comes with trading cards.  The lyrics are perhaps their most engaging yet, including bits af poetry read aloud by EV.  Problem is, No Code fails musically.  There are two reasons for this; 1) It is a poor representation of the talent evident eveywhere else in the production, and; 2) It sounds nothing like the Pearl Jam we've come to know.  The brilliance is gone -- The music is s l o w, dull and downright boring.
B000002C1W|5.0|This album will perhaps always remain the most underrated of Floyd albums for several reasons.  A Momentary Lapse Of Reason represents a point of transition for the band and a general movement from social commentary to a meticulous focus on musicianship.<br />At this point in the band's existence it did have something to prove to the world.  Waters was a dominant figure in the band before, and while he may have oversaw much of the concepts and lyrics behind the albums he was involved with, the fact remained that without Gilmour, Mason, and Wright providing the musical genius as they had for so long Waters couldn't do anything particularly special.  The creation of this album and The Division Bell along with everything Waters did in his solo career reinforces this idea.  Waters was a poet, and that was the extent of his contribution to the band.  For example, all of the most important and most recognizable songs from the Wall, Including Comfortably Numb, Another Brick in the Wall Part 2, and Run Like Hell were musically arranged almost entirely by Gilmour along with much of the rest of the album.  This album may lack the lyrical concepts of the Waters era, but it expands on the even more important frontier of intricate musical development.  Gilmour's guitar work here and in DB is some of his best by far, and that's at least worth a listen.
B000002A3T|5.0|The Division Bell, a last attempt by Post-Pink Floyd did not earn what it should. You cant really compare Post Pink Floyd to the original, as Roger Waters is missing. Its like comparing ELO to ELO II. However, After a slightly uneven, but still good Momentary Lapse of Reason, the three heroes released this one. And what a cd it is. Division Bell contains a much less experimental music than Lapse, but more solid music, almost to a point that is clear they wont try to break any barriers. <BR>No matter what, this is what the third generation PF should sound like. <br />Major highlights on this album is the beautiful &quot;Coming back to Life&quot;, &quot;Wearing the inside out&quot;, &quot;What do you want from me&quot;, &quot;Take it back&quot;, &quot;Marooned&quot; and &quot;High Hopes&quot;. These songs are wonderful songs, unlike anything else you have heard. The rest of the songs are still very, very good, and there is no real fillers here. <br />Too bad this was Pink Floyds last album, as this showed a sign of a group finding their way. It may be the last Pink Floyd album, but it is up on the top, and since this is without Roger Waters, I range this as one of the best too.<br />I love this album, it is the PF I listen the most too. That says a lot.
B000002A3T|5.0|Division Bell is probably my Favorite Pink Floyd album, even over Dark Side of The Moon.  I understand that the general mass of people would not agree that Division is Floyd's best material. It is unlike anything from the late Water's era in that it does not have that ultimately dark, experimental sound to it that Animals or The Wall had.  Still, I think it's unfair to underate this album based on lyrical accusations and I think it's even more rediculous to say that the music, especially Gilmour's guitar, is \\"watered down,\\" as the introductory editorial for Amazon suggests.<br />I don't want to patronize too much with obvious details, but this album is generally about how recognition between one individual and another and vice-versa can break down through a fundamental lack of communication and/or understanding.  It's a very adequate concept considering the complete breakdown between Waters and the rest of the band, and I think all Floyd fans know some frustration that differences in this matter could not be circumvented.  As in Momentary Lapse of Reason, the lyrics seem to be geared as compliments to the music rather than the dominating focus of the album.  However, this album lyrically is a step up from A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and the words seem far more relevant and honest.<br />I can perhaps understand someone claiming that Gilmour's guitar in this album is \\"unfloydian,\\" but to say Gilmour's guitar is \\"watered down\\" seems unfair and innacurate.  If you need proof of this, listen to track #5 \\"Marooned\\" on this album.  This song features some of my favorite guitar work from any artist because it captures an admonition or a monologue without any lyrics. The song then becomes wholly open to interpretation by the listener.  It is unpretentious and yet emotional, and gives a sound example of the type of guitarist Gilmour is and always has been.  The guitar work lacks some of the experimentation present in other Floyd efforts, but appears unhidden, exposed and beautiful.  I think that was Gilmour's intent in this album; to truly communicate rather than innovate. It seems unfair to criticize him for some personal expression, especially when it's so perfectly executedutiful.

B0000025ZF|5.0|This cd is beyong belief. From the brooding intro \\"Apparently they were traveling abroad\\" to the rocker \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchiking\\", this takes the listener out for a trip he wont forget. This is Roger Waters finest solo-album, you will find so much of Pink Floyd here, much more than any of his others. The sound is strong, the melodies are directly haunting, and some parts glues it self to your brain for life, like the rolling of thunder in \\"Sexual Revolution\\". Eric Clapton guest stars here too, making the guitarsolo feel competent and professional. Roger Waters have a wonderful voice on this record, he knows how to tell a story just by changing the pitch of his voice. The songs, melodies, it is just beyond everything I have ever heard. This album has become a permanent listening experience for me every week, and it really deserves it. <br />Too little credit were given this cd, and it is a shame, for this is the best Post Pink Floyd Roger has written and done. In fact nothing else comes close, and this is the finest example of musical storytelling ever.
B000024D4R|5.0|This is NOT punk.  It is not an attempt to combat, compete or interact with punk.  Punk is gratuitous, aggressive, arrogant snapshots of society targeted at cultural trends, political strife, screwed up girl/boyfriends, and so on.<br />Animals is none of these.  Everyone loves to point out that this album was made during the time of the sex pistols.  All I have to say is, \\"Who are the Sex Pistols?\\"  Has their career survived or in any way rivaled that of Pink Floyd?  While the Sex Pistols I'm sure have some significance to the music industry, I can safely say that I have yet to hear ANY sex pistols song, and simply put, the survival of Animals suggests it's creators used a masterful hand in it's creation, unlike the long-forgotten whimsical rantings of some defecating jerk.<br />Back on topic, despite the inner-strife prevalent in the Pre-Wall Floyd era, I consider this album to be the highpoint of the band's career overall.  The lyrics and concepts are great, but the true brilliance lies in the music; it's simply breath-taking.  The huge instrumental sections in each song command your attention, and the guitar riffs and keyboard sequences, the experimental vocal distortion, and the \\"pig\\" pedal all add an overwhelming experience for the listener.  This album represents a fusion of two of Floyd's most imporatant time periods and was the obvious step in the band's evolution between the Dark Side years to the Wall.<br />Appreciate this album for what it is (a masterpiece) but for god's sake, dont' compare it to anything Punk!

FUHGEDDABOUDIT!<br />  Or did you think it would be merely a recipe book with little or nothing of interest to Sopranos fans, a boring book of recipes? GEDOUDDAHEAYH!!!<br />  The Sopranos Family Cookbook is a great concept -- such a masterful idea that you almost wonder why they didn't think of it before (actually they did, but only this year moved to \\"merchandising\\".). It's a WONDERFUL stand-alone cook-book, that includes some recipes that are simple enough for someone like me who feels like Wolfgang Puck after pouring reheated Ragu on pasta. There are BOTH simple and ornate authentic Italian recipes galore, carefully spelled out -- even instructions on the BEST way to cut garlic (it gives you the three ways, depending on the strength of the taste you want and tells you to  avoid garlic presses and garlic powder which is \\"mayonnaiser behavior.\\").Tony's chef friend, Artie Bucco, who supposedly compiled the book, also gives various tips on things such as choosing olive oil and wines.<br />  Photo-illustrated \\"interviews\\" with key cast characters deliciously season this book and they'll be a (non-homicidal) scream for Sopranos fans. In other words, you truly get TWO BOOKS in and one and can buy (or with great confidence GIFT) this book as a functional cookbook (for a beginner cook or an experienced cook) or as another one of the quickly emerging great books on what some call TV's greatest show (the other GREAT new book is David Chase's book of Sopranos scripts from the first three seasons, also available on Amazon.com).<br />  It's impossible to list all my favorite recipes here, but  JUST a few include: Marinara Sauce, Bistecca Piaaziola, Giambotta (vegetable stew),  Janice Soprano's Vegetarian Baked Ziti, Standing Rib Roast (the one I want to perfect), Baked Ziti with little meatballs,  Baked Chicken with Potatotes, Lemon and Oregano, Baked Chicken Cacciatore, home-de Ah Beetz (pizza), Ceasar Salad, my parent's favorite Spaghetti Puttanesca...and many more.<br />  Sopranos fans (and cooks who want to also enjoy READING a cook book) will love the interviews with Sopranos characters. My favorite is with Tony's imported-from-Italy henchman Furio Giunta who says  he doesn't like the food in America: \\"First, you use too much sauce on your spaghetti.  Very bad. Too soupy. Can't taste the pasta, the semolina...They you do something really stupid. You drink cappuccino after dinner!\\"<br />  And then there is Janice Soprano; \\"I grew up in a typical Italian-American family of that era and milieu...I was in charge of setting the table, given the artistic touch that I, alone among my siblings, possess...My mother Livia Pollio Soprano was a typical stay-at-home-mom...\\"<br />  Just remember: one day you may be in your kitchen, nearly whacked by culinary disaster, pondering a too-difficult or too-simplistic cookbook, echoing the same exact words as Tony  Soprano in the final scene of the episode Pine Barrens: \\"Why does everything have to be so hard? I'm not sayin' I'm perfect, but I do the right...thing for my family. Doesn't that count for anything?\\"<br />  If your family hates your meal it won't.

Highly recommended.

B0000028UK|5.0|There are many out in this world who would agree that Many of the new bands (Especially Creed) are desperately trying to copy Pearl Jam mainly because they are the GREATEST. They have shown that making music videos is unnecessary to gain popularity. Versus has a much more refined sound than Ten, which makes it enjoyable to listen to for people who are not particularly fond of heavy rock music. Glorified G, in my opinion, is musically their best song on this album. Lyrically, Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town is by far the best. However, Daughter is the best song in the world!!. Just having one listen to this album makes me content. <br /> Those Creed Fans who have never heard of Pearl Jam (And i'm sure that teenage girls haven't) Will hate Creed after listening to this album, and quite frankly all of the other -Studio- albums that Pearl Jam has made. Anyone who thinks that Scott Stapp doesn't sound like the great Eddie Vedder, should go to a mental home.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is one of the best-loved of the Disney classics.  The characters are lovable, the animation is beautiful, and the songs are enjoyable.  What more could you want?  This film is truly a masterpiece. <br />The Special Edition release on DVD is incredible.  It is a 2-disc set, and comes with a CD-ROM as well.  The box advertises a &quot;2-disc Experiential DVD.&quot;  I don't know what experiential is, but the special features are awesome.  You can enter the Beast's castle, play games, and do all kinds of fun Disney stuff--sure to keep the kids entertained for hours.  There is also a very entertaining new song.<br />This is definitely one of the best animated films ever, and now this incredible DVD release made it that much better.  Don't miss it!
0783225970|5.0|THIS HAS BEEN CALLED BY SOME &quot;THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME&quot; WHICH IS A LOT TO SAY WITH ALL THE MOVIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN TODAY'S MARKET. REALISM &amp; POWERFUL MESSAGES MAKE THIS MOVIE WHAT IT IS, A MASTERPEICE.....
0783231482|5.0|It is appropriate that the music supervisors and choreographers are credited first in this film. Surely they did the most work, and it shows. This film is by far one of if not the very best comedy-musical I have ever seen. Loaded with laughs as well as some very excellent musical numbers and a climactic car chase too good to miss, this film is a comedy gem from director John Landis and stars Dan Akroyd and John Belushi. There are several laugh-out-loud moments as well as get-up-and-dance tunes. It's so fun, so energized, and so hip that disliking this movie is impossible! This would make a great family movie if it weren't for the frequent language. When the Blues Brothers finally get to their concert and start to sing &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love,&quot; I was clapping and cheering. Never has a film excited me and made me feel as good as &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot; It's a surefire hit and definite classic!
B000050FEN|5.0|i'd like to think of seven as one of the films that redefined the horror/thriller genre. it is not made in the tradition of mindless slasher movies preceeding it, but it was made with an attention to detail that made it a head above most thrillers. it is unapologetically bleak, with incessant rain and gloomy atmosphere which is i think the perfect background to the subject on hand. heck, it is about a grisly serial killer, right? what did you expect, alice in wonderland?<br />i was 14 when i saw this movie - my brother brought my sister and i to see it on the big screen - and boy, did it blew my mind! it had never occured to me that such a great movie could be made. at that time, i had *no* idea of who fincher was nor was i aware of his previous efforts; so basically, i went to see the movie with an open mind, never expecting more than just a glimpse of brad pitt - who i adored at that time, and still now. and all i knew was that morgan freeman was a veteran actor who had left a positive impression the precious few times that i had seen his movies - and that was it.<br />so i was really in for a surprise. freeman was the perfect choice for the role of detective somerset, a man who looks ready to retire that very second if he had the chance and pitt as detective mills was his perfect foil - a man so eager to jump into the job on hand he seemed belligerent at times. the plot was also amazing; seven murders - all based on the seven deadly sins - that took place in a week (i think) and they have no clue as to whom the next victim will be. the killer, john doe - a superb spacey - is absolutely chilling as he taunts and leads the detectives in a merry chase.<br />the media made a lot of noice when this movie first came out, you know the usual stuff about how mvies like this glorifies violence... i beg to differ. a lot of times, the entertainment industry is just reflecting back what is happening in the real world - nothing more, nothing less.. just ask the cops.<br />so if you are squeasy, you know that you don't have to watch this movie. but other than that, this is a great movie that a lot of people can appreciate - because it is a mirror to the real world. a great movie with a great cast - i can't ask for more.<br />p/s: fincher went on and made the absolutely fantastic \\"the fight club\\"... don't miss it!
B000005GW2|5.0|This is it! <BR>If you buy one CD this year buy this one.  Chet Baker had a velvet touch on the trumpet, and an almost niave, innocent voice that invites one into his world.  His interpretations of these standards are entirely original and his own.  He captivates the quiet intimacy of a hushed candlelight dinner.   His boyish charm flows from each song.  <br />When he sings the ensemble let's him sing when he plays the ensemble let's him play giving his talent center stage.  A perfect choice for the fall drive through the changing leaves, a summer night dancing under the stars or a warm winter's evening by the fire.
6300271439|5.0|This Movie is really nice, and not a bad film, like said critics. Many say it's a bad video clip and that Madonna save this sh... I don't think so. Madonna is great, that's truth, but the movie is a pretty one, with no pretention and  think it deserves a look.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This Cd is good for those car rides down back roads, dark nights, or rainy days. It's simply just a good cd to sit back and chill to. A lot of people are calling it depressing but I find it far from that. When you listen to this cd it puts things into a different perspective and makes the world around you beautiful and ambiant. Its a different approach to the traditional catchy,unoriginal stuff that is usually released these days. Some notable tracks are the golden age, Paper tiger, little one, already dead, lonesome tears, to say the least. All the songs are good but these stick out in my mind the most. The use of orchestral music is alo well displayed in some of the tracks. Good work Beck
0452282152|4.0|This was a quick easy read. The writing style was not very sophisticated, but it did paint a good picture (no pun intended) of life for a working girl at that time.
0609610570|5.0|As the authors point out, many people say or think &quot;of course you need to execute&quot; without a clear understanding of how to make that happen.  The authors here do a great job illustrating how a leader can execute.  This is the first book I have read that clearly shows what interdependence should exist among strategy, operations, and the people process.  And, in fact, these relationships are the key to execution.<br />I highly recommend this book to people who can and want to make their organizations execute better and to people who are in executing organizations who want to better understand why their organizations execute.
1586210661|5.0|I am a huge fan of David Sedaris on public radio and when I saw his book, I knew I had to read it.  I found myself bursting into laughter and having to read entire chapters out loud to my husband.  Definitely a great book that makes you look for the hilarious moments in your own family.
0792156684|2.0|As the new owner of a digital widescreen, and anyone reading this review will soon have one, I have gone through all my DVD's and weeded out those which are not &quot;anamorphic&quot; or &quot;enhanced for 16 by 9&quot;.   Without those words, the black bars on a widescreen movie will take up 1/3 of a picture's available resolution.  Once you get a widescreen TV, the only way to fill your screen with these movies is to &quot;zoom in&quot; - a great loss in resolution.  Paramount really blew it with the creation of this DVD, as most all of the new crop of DVDs are anamorphic or enhanced for widescreen.  It's a great story, but I just can't bring myself to watch it anymore knowing it could have looked so much better.
0449000729|5.0|I personally already had an interest in history, so this book was a natural for me.  I was expecting something that was little more text booky, but this was a gripping story starting with beginning of nomadic man and taking us up to present day.  I took months to read this book, because I would read whole passages several times to really commit them to memory.  As the book entered the 18th and 19th century, I found myself dreading the end of the story.<br />Excellent book!
0792833201|4.0|\\"Poltergeist\\" is possibly one of Speiberg's best films ever made. ...The content from the movie is guarenteed to give almost ANYBODY nightmares!!<br />     The story is about little curious Carol Ann who unleashes a terrifying secret upon her family after discovering evil spirits living within her T.V. The supernatural events appear to be fun and quite amusing at first, but the entity soon turns into a nightmare when her brother is attacked by a monstrous man-eating tree!!!<br />     To make matters worse, Carol Ann herself has been kidnapped and taken into another dimension where the demons torture her trying to convice her to lead them to \\"the light\\". Now, the only way out is in, as her parents must travel into the horrors of the afterlife and save their daughter from \\"the beast\\". <br />**WARNING** <BR>(Do NOT read this part if you haven't seen the movie!)<br />     The family saves Carol Ann with the help of an old psychic-lady who somehow eerily knows about the light. It's all over now(OR IS IT?!!) as they plan to pack their bags move out of the house the next following day. However, the spirits return and try to kill Robby, Carol Ann's brother after taking possession of a murderous stuffed clown-doll. <br />     Meanwhile, the mother is unexpectadly attacked after noticing that her children are in danger. The Special-FX here are quite amazing but hella freaky at the same time. She escapes the demons, but her kids are still locked in their own room from the supernatural-power that wants them both DEAD. They barely make it out, as the closet turns out to be yet another portal back to the afterlife.<br />     They all make it out(luckily!), and the home begins to crumble into some kind of ball as they watch it dissapear in horror! It turns out that the home that was bought was originally built over a cemetary (along w/the other houses), which explains about the hauntings which took place. They drive to a far-off motel and continue their life. But before they get settled, the father puts the T.V. outside on the deck.(which is obvious why.) <br />     I wasn't around during the year of 1982, but I'm glad I was able to get the chance to see this movie when it was aired over-and-over again on TNT. And man, it scared the hell outta me! This is better than \\"The Amityville Horror\\" (which also wasn't that good of a movie). It's kinda creepy the way Carol Ann communicates through the T.V. (that scene still sends chills down my spine.) The pool scene was also an entertaining part and was really unpredictable! It's oldskool, but the Special-FX overall, are some of the best I've ever seen in a movie!!...WATCH ALONE AT NIGHT, IF YOU DARE! ^_^
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is one of the best short books that I have read.  It uses a lot of unusual ideas and dialogue, and the book makes you think of what the future holds for us.  In the book, Jonas an 11-year-old boy is about ready to become a man in his community.  The community in the book is a utopia, where everything is perfect.  He lives in a community where the citizens have never heard of war or pain.  Children are assigned to married couples and you have to take pills that will not allow you to have any ... fantasies. Anything that isn't perfect is \\"released\\" from the community, including people!<BR> When a young man turns 12 in his community, many responsibilities are put upon him.  He is assigned a job according to his abilities and what is good for the community.  When Jonas turns 12, he is assigned the job of being the Receiver.  The Receiver is one of the highest-ranking jobs in the community.  Jonas would have to go the Giver's dwellings and receive all of the memories from the past.  The Giver shows him memories of war and pain, which Jonas is devastated by.  He also shows him memories of good things like snow and sled-riding, both of which Jonas as never heard of.<BR> The book goes on with Jonas receiving many memories and wanting to experience these feelings.  But, he knows that there is no way to experience them there, so he decides to take action.
B00006J3WH|5.0|As a long time Buffy fan, I was thrilled that this CD was going to be released and even more thrilled when the soundtrack arrived in the mail a couple of days later.  Amazingly fast shipping from amazon.ca!!<br />I agree with some of the other reviews that parts of the edited out dialogue and sound effects were essential to the songs but not to all of them.  I'm pretty sure that most fans who own this CD has own the 'other' version as well ^_^ so all is good.<br />Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) and Amber Benson (Tara) shine very brightly in this CD and their songs were sung eloquently.  The other cast members also sung with distinction.<br />The extra song tracks were also a bonus to listen to.  Definitely worth the $$$<br />If you're a Buffy fan then you can't go wrong by buying this CD!<br />To Joss Whedon and to all those who make Buffy The Vampire Slayer a success.....more please.....and thanks!
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD is awesome for an avid Buffy fan like myself.  I am most appreciative that not only did they put out the music, they also included the lyrics in CD case.  For someone like me, who goes crazy if she can't understand what someone is singing, this was a major plus.<br />Also, the added tracks were great...I loved Hush as an episode and the music is what made it so great.  <br />Overall, I am very pleased that they put this on CD and have already listened to it numerous times.
B000002A46|3.0|This is a pretty good Christmas cd IF, and only IF you like Mariah Carey. Her ear-piercing version of Oh Holy Night is one of the worst i've heard ever. Her vocal gymnastics are not suited to traditional-style Christmas music. The up-tempo pop Christmas songs she does are good, but otherwise i think she should stick to her own material. Not every artist is suited to doing traditional religious Christmas songs. Celine Dion is another one guilty of that.
B00003CX8J|3.0|Cheesy-factor is through the roof. Hollywood loves this<BR>sort of thing. There have been a bunch of other good<BR>comic book films and comic-bookish films over the last<BR>five years.

0385493622|5.0|It's not often that I use the word brilliant when discussing contemporary literature, but this book is a just that. Simon Singh has woven a beautiful narrative about one of mathematics greatest mysteries. It's smoothly written, informative, and dramatic. It ranks among the greatest books I've ever read.
B00005B36H|5.0|while listening to this cd. Buy it, its that good.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King remains one of the most amazing, intelligent and creative writers of our time...of ALL time.  His words, once used to do no more than terrify, have become words of peace and hope...and ones that every aspiring writer should read at least a little of.  I believe On Writing to be his most brilliant work, and not just because it is a wonderful guide of the craft of creation, it is a touching, sometimes even haunting memoir of King's life, and how he came to be such an appreciated writer.  <br />Instead of being like a textbook, On Writing draws from King's own experiences, including using poison ivy as toilet paper, college and his near fatal accident...and relates them on tools for writing.  Somehow, in the brilliance he possesses, King relates these awkward experiences to his readers, and understanding is attained.  By the end, you feel saved, and inspired to write 10,000 words a day.  It is a book that I would read just for fun, and do not understand why it is required reading for creative writing classes.  It is one of the shortest books King has written, but its brilliance still shines bright.<br />If you want to feel inspired as well, and need to be pushed away from writer's block, pick this up and sit down with it.  I promise you, you will not be able to put it down, and when you finally finish, you will want to know when the sequel comes out.
0064471837|5.0|Fantasy, as a genre, is longer the most: multi volume epics filled with cataclysmic events spanning years.<br />And then, there's Sabriel. Size: one volume. Page count: just under 500 pages. I polished this off in a couple days.<br />But what a couple of days.<br />I like long things. If a book doesn't drag, then I don't care how long it lasts. Hell, I read all 1,400 pages of Les Miserables, unabridged, (took like six months) and it is quite a book. But that doesn't mean I dislike short books. Sabriel is a good read: a universe with simple rules that you are always on the verge of understanding, with inference instead of exposition. The opening is well written: it follows the tried-and-true method where you are given useful information that pertains to the plot, sucks you into the story, and allows the main part of the story to begin calmly all the same. The Fellowship of the Ring, film version, begins similarly.<br />The universe itself is impressive, avoiding the traditional swords, wizards, fireballs, and demons. The undead are familiar to any fantasy reader, but not these undead. Necromantic magic uses literal bells and whistles; death is a river leading from life to the beyond. Pure magic has its own set of rules, rules that are never explained so much as danced around. And modern technology exists, adding instead of taking away from the power of magic.<br />So, if you're looking for a quick read, without the length of the Lord of the Rings, much less the Wheel of Time or Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, then here's a treat for you: compact, but stirring for the time it lasts. One thing keeps you from begging for more: there's no need to say more.
0446530573|2.0|Tony Soprano, if he were real, would either fall over laughing or have a panic attack if he learned some publishing-house nitwits were capitalizing his name for some lame cookbook. The recipes are standard Italian fare with a few jazzed up with recent trends, but nothing you'd go out of your way to prepare for guests. This thing ranks right up there with the Forrest Gump cookbook: a rather uncreative way to milk even more money from a popular franchise. And we thought the over-the-top product placements on the show were bad enough! Save yourself the trouble, buy a \\"regular\\" cookbook with better (if less hip) recipes and save your money for Sopranos DVDs.
0767802470|3.0|Sorry to all those devotees out there that wouldn't want <BR>minute to be cut and wouldn't want this one to ever end--<BR>but this movie was in bad need of editing. As a movie<BR>and a story, this one is a B+ script in search of some<BR>minor touch-up. Visionary? Maybe in 1982. Today it<BR>feels in need of repair. That seems strange for a period<BR>piece, I know, but if the director were to make this movie<BR>today, it would probably be better. I'm not talking about<BR>explosions or special effects. Just set design and general<BR>camera work.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Consider it a 2.5 star rating!<br />Good eye candy! Not the greatest or even close, but good! I really liked how they kept the spirit of the actual Time Machine's design! <br />But eye candy is not everything...<br />I agree with those who say they don't care about the differences in this flick when compared to the earlier George Pal film version and HG Wells book. I would by no means consider it a \\"loose\\" adaptation of it's predeccesors. Besides, I think it's always nice to add some freshness... Albeit if it is done well! And while I do feel that most of the time the variations do succeed in keeping this old tale ripe, there are some that will leave the viewer dissapointed because of their inane delivery! <br />As some of mentioned... There's a bad plot inconsistency here and there that does leave one with a feeling that they botched the job on this one. And these errors are delivered in one great batch at a critical juxt of the film which doesn't help matters! I found this movie rather enjoyable and intelligently handled right up to about the last fifteen minutes... Then it just dissolves into stupidity! While I was satisfied with the answer to Pearce's time \\"paradox\\", which is the main plot-line of the movie... I reckon the makers settled on upping the tempo for the remainder of the ending to give it more of an action movie feel, and just failed in delivering it convincingly. A pity!<br />Still, I like the movie, own it, have watched it multiple times, and shall watch it again one day. Granted I'm one of those rabid collectors though! In my honest opinion it's definitely worth a look... As a rental first! And because I saw someone state it in a review here... I wouldn't go as far to call this a kid's flick! In fact my 15 year old neice who can handle the Evil Dead films had nitemares the night after watching the Moorlocks ransack the Eloi village! And let me mention the cannibalism and a certain pit of human by-products! So parents don't expect Disney because ofthat one off base review, use discretion!
630512762X|5.0|This was definitely one of the best action movies ever with  wonderful scenes and dialogues. &quot;Peaches, I can eat peach for hours.&quot; &quot;-You're not the only one in the family with the brains. <BR>-No, although now I am the only one with the looks.&quot; &quot;I hate to see you go, but I LOVE to watch you leave.&quot;
B00003CX5P|2.0|It's interesting. Star Wars, a series that Mark Hamill's acting couldn't kill, was laid low by it's own creator. The Phantom Menace took a formerly great series and disolved it into a stream of slapstick, pod racing, and Jar-Jar Binks. Some thoughts: why are the battle robots given weapons that are seperate from themselves? Why aren't the built into the hardware? Also, why do these death robots use normal speach to talk to each other, and why do they look like people instead of a form that kills more efficently?<br />However, it does warrant a second star. Why? For one part: the Duel of the Fates, a John Williams-underscored fight sequence on par with the better moments of Star Wars. If the rest of the film had been on that level, The Phantom Menace might have been the best of the series. Instead, it is regared, by and large, as the worst.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I never intended to watch Shrek, but when we received it as a gift, I felt obligated. I must admit that I found it surprisingly good. I think the more I watch it, the funnier it gets. Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) is the perfect comic relief. While Shrek is quite crude at times and frequently is just downright vulgur, the \\"moral of the story\\" is driven home in a big way with a somewhat surprise ending. Overall, I recommend Shrek to any teen or adult. However, parents be cautioned. This movie may not be appropriate for young children.
B00003CXPD|4.0|It's not the best art-house movie ever, but gosh it is a lot<BR>better than so many films. Simple story. Simple is good.<BR>Predictable? Yes. Ingenious nonetheless? Yes.<BR>No heavy aftertaste. Yum.

0893860220|5.0|I bought this book January 11, 1991 and have left it at the bedside, nightly pick it up and turn to any page and start reading.  As I read the more I'm aware of the  myriad  blocks to looking within.  The intensity to go within comes in cycles and often i'm left with periods of restlessnes.  But it never fails, something prompts me to go back to this book and listen to the dialog again and again which is always fresh.  The guilt trips of not being good enough or holy enough was taken away by this book.  The fear is almost gone.  Over the years i have come to see it as my only spiritual reading and after a few pages will put it down and slip into a watchful state of just being.  Strange, but this book found me.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you love the show, then you will love this album.  This album is glowing with the hidden talents of our favorite actors.  You'll love it.

B00003CXI1|5.0|My Husband and I loved it!  We read all four novels.  Looking forward to the fifth.  When the movie came out on DVD we bought it instantly!  And have watched it numerous times.  The movie is just like the book.  We only wished it didn't end there.  Leaves you wanting to see more.  The characters are true to form.  Graphics are fabulous.  The next question is, &quot;When does the sequel come out on DVD?!&quot;
B00004XMTC|3.0|This movie was not just a throwback to the less comic iteration of James Bond, but this movie also brought Sean Connery back into the role that he held for so long.  Kim Bassinger and Max von Sydow join the cast as James Bond, with the help of Felix Leiter from the CIA, fight to stop SPECTRE from extorting billions from the world governments by threatening detonation of a nuclear device.<br />The movie is filled with double meanings.  For instance, M believes that James is overweight and too old to keep up as an agent.  This parallels how some felt that Connery was past his days as the well known spy.  There are other little quotes, as well as a wink, to let you know that this was all intentional.  For James Bond, and Sean Connery, fans, this is like an added treat.<br />I do wish there were more of von Sydow in the movie, but the movie does well focusing on Connery.  The movie is also a little dated with the video games, like Centipede, that are shown in the casino.<br />I would still recommend watching this film.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is a very impressive movie that has earned a spot in the upper echelon of movie greatness.  Mel Gibson totally embraces his role as William Wallace and delivers an immaculate performance throughout the film. This motion picture is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br />Initially what grabbed me about this movie were the world-class scenery shots.  From their, the movie explodes with brilliance as an amazing story unfolds and you are taken directly into the heart of a highly hostile, historical confrontation between the Brits and Scots.  The battle scenes set a new standard in exellence and the love story doesn't get too overdrawn out and boring.  Along with some timely humor, a few suprise twists and a great ending, Braveheart comes together to create a fabulous adventure.<br />The only complaint I have heard about this movie is that there are a few historical inaccuracies...honestly no body cares and we all love the kilts.  If for some reason you have not already seen Braveheart, make it a priority in the very near future.  I cannot recommend this movie enough, it has become one of my all-time favorites and I know I don't stand alone.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This really isn't a very good movie. It's a barely passable<BR>movie. It's made up as a period piece, but it is not very<BR>credible in that respect. A simple-minded enough way<BR>to kill a couple hours, I guess, but this is clearly just<BR>another effort to make money off of the WWII jones that<BR>most people have and cannot refuse. The acting is very<BR>minimal, and in fact there is wasted talent all over -- <BR>Harvey Keitel in particular. The explosions are ... ok, <BR>I guess, but the sense of triumph in this one is muted<BR>by the fact that I can turn on the History Channel any day<BR>of the week and watch something more compelling.<BR>Das Boot, the German movie, is frankly a bit better than<BR>this, and I didn't even like Das Boot very much!
B0000696I0|3.0|I can't possibly give this movie the five stars I would like to. It's been a long time since I've seen it until I found it at Wal-Mart. I bought it, and very eagerly watched it, and while I still love it I am also no longer marred by being a child, the flaws of this movie are simply that its dated now. Michelangelo's comment about &quot;video games in 3D&quot; garnered a chuckle out of me because for over almost a decade now video games have been in 3D.<br /> Its kind of weird how this works. As a child I didn't much care for the first Turtles movie, but as an adult suddenly the humor makes sense and I find it to be a very enjoyable flick, in contrast, TMNT 2, which was my favorite as a child of the TMNT trilogy, now seems... well... childish. Its not that this movie is unenjoyable, as its still a fun movie, just don't expect the depth of something like... say X-Men, or Spider-Man, the type of super hero movies I tend to go for now. I think its safe to say that I've out grown the Ninja Turtles. Still, as a Jim Henson fan, I'm still glad I have this movie now, as I am a Henson completist and am trying to get every Henson related film on DVD. I may be single still, but I hope to have a family someday, and it will be great to be able to show these types of movies to my children who will likely find more entertainment value out of this particular installment than I did.<br /> Please don't misunderstand the review, its not that I don't like this film, it's just that as an adult, the first movie was a lot better.
B00005JKNF|1.0|Altman is, of course, the maker of M.A.S.H., Nashville, Short Cuts, The Long Goodbye, Brewster McCloud and McCabe and Mrs. Miller, some of the best films of their time. <br />This is not work of that caliber.<br />The story can't attain a sense of momentum. We never get to know the people very well. There seems to be no main event, but lots of small, fussy side proceedings. In fact, we 'hang out' for far too long, right at a bunch of strangers' elbows, soaking up rich atmosphere and opaque jollity as though it will all begin to matter soon. There is a bit of fire right at the end. Emotions flash, and we glimpse a new facet of one character for the first time. Then the film ends. We have sat through over 2 hours of what feels like a setting of the stage, a laying of the groundwork for a story. Then the closing credits roll. If you are at all like me, you will be asking what on EARTH was that all about. A major disappointment from a director who has done amazing things. Cannot recommend.
B000051S44|5.0|\\"LeMans\\" is one of the few contemporary major motion pictures that explore the human factors and motivations in Motor Racing. I feel that the reason for this is that the star of the movie, Steve McQueen (as American race driver Michael Delaney), understood professional motorsport very well. McQueen competed in several international sports car events, notably the 1970 Sebring 12 hours, prior to the start of this project.<br />Critics have taken the movie to task for it's dark feeling; it's true that most scenes in the movie at least hint at the constant danger inherent in the most violent of the remaining \\"blood sports\\". However, I feel that it's the thoughtful way that the danger is acknowledged is what makes this film particularly interesting. One only has to look to the opening scene where Delaney (McQueen) visits the spot on the famous Mulsanne straight where he was involved in an accident in the prior years running of the famous 24 hours race that claimed the life of a rival. Not a word is spoken in this scene, but the viewer knows what happened, and the agony that Delaney feels having been involved in the fatal crash.<br />It is ironic that the film is largely based on events that happened in the 1970 LeMans 24 hours sports car endurance race. 1970 will forever be noted in the record books as the fastest and most dangerous running of this famous race. Due to changes in the layout of the course, emasculating the famous Mulsanne straight (due to safety concerns), and due to changes in specification of the race cars themselves, it is likely that Vic Elford's 242.685 km/h qualifying lap and race record lap of 241.235 km/h will never be eclipsed. It is to be noted that in recent years the winner of the event has completed more miles (in the 2000 event more than 5000 km were completed by the winner), but this is due to rain causing a dramatic slowing of the field in 1970.<br />Speaking of rain- there is an interesting scene in the first hour of the movie where the Porsche and Ferrari team managers are faced with losing the lead by calling their drivers in for rain tyres. Who would blink first- you could cut the tension shown on screen with a knife. Finally a minor accident on the course convinces both team managers that they must bring their drivers into the pits to avoid disaster.<br />Even if you aren't a racing fan, you owe it to yourself to witness the breathtaking \\"first person\\" driving scenes and the thrilling in-car shots. The story of how this spectacular photography was achieved is the subject of a recent book \\"A French Kiss With Death\\" which I would strongly suggest that students of cinematography and the curious take the time to read.<br />Overall, the movie \\"LeMans\\" is more about the human drama that is endurance sports car racing, than the race that the movie takes its name from. Enthusiasts will thrill in seeing the vintage racing footage and the \\"staged\\" shots taken not only at the circuit, but during the race itself (in full 35mm Panavision). But everyone can appreciate the emotion, irony and drama that is shown to the viewer by the talented cast.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Lynch is the master of everything that is flipped on its<BR>head. Anyone who has seen any of his previous films<BR>probably already knew that. By the end of this movie,<BR>you have profound grief for the principal character, and<BR>the effect has great impact. Never mind anyone that says <BR>that the movie is incomprehensible. It just isn't true. No, it's <BR>not linear storytelling-- but there isn't anything about it that is <BR>any more complicated than your average noir thriller. <BR>Nonetheless, I thought that this film was less than brilliant <BR>by a notch. It is one of the best films of 2001, though.
B000009EAD|5.0|I must say that Iced Earth are one of the bands that give America a good name.  With mediocre bands dominating the mainstream, it's very refreshing to see a band that embraces their roots and still makes interesting metal without being cliched.  I urge all &quot;metalheads&quot; to check Iced Earth out.<br />This was the first IE disc I purchased, after a friend enthusiastically recommended them to me.  I still thank him for that.  IE has a unique sound, that while obviously indebted to such greats as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Cliff-era Metallica, and Slayer, still adds new ideas and makes music that is not in the least derivative.  Jon's fantastic guitars (both acoustic and electric) give both a sinewy heaviness and a subtle beauty to the proceedings.  Matt Barlow's ungodly vocals bring to mind past masters like Bruce Dickinson.  The rythym section is also quite good, although not on the same level as the vocals and guitars.  The songs have good variety of tempos, and the acoustic bits are really superb.  However, the final three songs truly make this a worthwhile album. The &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; trilogy, as they are called, will go down as an epic metal classic.  You really need to hear them.  All in all, this is a solid metal album that any open-minded metalhead with some taste would certainly enjoy.  I urge you to pick this up and hear some top-notch metal.<br />Up the Irons!!
B00003CXZ4|1.0|To be blunt, Memento is the cultural equivelant of colorization or hollywood remakes, or even those '70s Disco-Beat recordings of Big Band music KTel used to hawk on late night TV. It seeks, in a word, to make a cold meal appetizing to a new audience and isn't particularly skillful or smart about how it proceeds toward that dubious goal. Here it is people: A willfully perverse disassembly and reassembly of linear narrative is all Memento has going for it. Whoopee! To anyone having even name-dropping contact with Faulkner's The Sound and The Fury, Kurosawa's Rashomon or Welle's Citizen Kane, this alone isn't nearly enough to get the job done. Better people have made the map of this territory; Memento's makers don't know how to read it, plain and simple. Memento looks pretty, projecting depth with tons of style. But it is essentially as slick and vaccuous as movies get. It is Deep Movie Lite. It is Dragonfly for the coffeehouse set. <br />One Star, because there is no Zero Star. Consider yourself warned.
B00006DEFA|5.0|... <BR>* 30 minutes extra scene in this Director's Cut.  This extra scene is a real scene that parts of the movie.  It's not ... scene that should left out in the movie or 3 minutes extra scene like most other DVDs.<BR>* Peter Shaffer & Milos Forman commentary.  I usually dont listen to the commentary on DVD.  Out of hundreds of DVD I watched I think I only listen to 2 or 3 commentary before. This one is really good, mainly because they will discuss the historical accuracy of the plot.<BR>* Remastered 5.1 Audio<BR>* The Making of Amadeus.  Good and informational although nothing exceptional but still above average
B00000255X|5.0|Some consider this one to be too overdone what with EmmyLou Harris, Scarlet Rivera, and Jacques Levy.  Many times has this album been overlooked, but not for good reason.  Had this album come at any other time than it did, it could easily be cosidered Dylan's best.  For any other artist, this would be the ultimate.  Despite the fact thatr &quot;Blonde on Blonde,&quot; &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; and othrs are viewed as his best, &quot;Desire&quot; shows a side of Dylan rarely seen.  Songs like Hurricane and Joey are good examples of Dylan's storytelling, even though he had help in writing the album.  Most of the songs have a nice little gypsy feel to them, especially &quot;Romance in Durango&quot; with it's Spanish flavor, and &quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; in which, as someone once said, Dylan sings like an Arabian prince.  A popular theme in this album is travel and adventure, seen most notably in &quot;Durango&quot; &quot;Mozambique&quot; and my personal favorite track, &quot;Black Diamond Bay.&quot;  <BR>So in short, is this album for you?  You decide.  If you like lyrics with meaning and fun, and music that is haunting and beautiful, then yes.  As for the songs:<BR>1.Hurricane 9/10.  The big single about Rubin Carter.  Pretty good song with nice singing and violin.<br />2.Isis 10/10.  A very very good song about a man's bizarre jouney seemingly with an Egyptian feel that adds a nice mood.<br />3.Mozambique  10/10.  A little short, but very nice tune to it.  Makes me wanna go there.  I love the violin and singing.<br />4.One More Cup of Coffee 10/10.  Haunting.  Very Arabian feeling with Dylan harmonizing nicely, perfectly backed up by Harris and Rivera.<br />5.Oh Sister 8/10.  Not bad, but not the best.  A little dull and slow, but nice in its own right.<br />6.Joey  8/10.  See above.  This one is just a tad too long and probably the worst of Dylan's looooooooooooong epic songs.  Even Brownsville Girl is better.<br />7.Romance in Durango 10/10.  Romantic and gypsy in origin.  I imagine a man like Dylan on the cover and his beloved in sunny Mexico.  Very imaginative.<br />8.Black Diamond Bay 11/10.  My absolute favorite song on this album.  Great story song about-well you figure it out ;)<br />9.Sara 9/10.  Written for his wife, a little sweet, and pretty nice.
0789723107|3.0|This is an OK book.  Good for those who have not designed a site and are unfamiliar with the internet.
B00003CXXS|5.0|this movie is awsome because it has cool new dinosaurs and also the sound effects are cool.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I listened to samples yesterday and fulfilled my mission to own the album immediately. In between other callings, I shopped and found the last one in the L.C. stack and thanked my lucky five stars.<BR>I find the music totally enthralling and hypnotizing, even without the lyrics. And the lyrics are classic Cohen. If you've experienced the magic of love and lost the person but not the magical afterglow, then you are in the bittersweet, melancholic zone in which this music resides. No one quite delivers this soul massage like Leonard Cohen, particularly in &quot;Ten New Songs.&quot;<BR>Contrary to the comments of previous customer reviewers, I find the production and accompaniment of Sharon Robinson to be a perfect fit, and I have a sneaking suspicion that Cohen was supremely satisfied with the process and the product. And that, assuming it is true, is genuine art.<BR>I will listen to &quot;Moany Groany Heart (Ten New Songs)&quot; enumerable times and each time it will sound better still.
0812932293|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a book as refreshing, interesting, informative and brash as Losing My Virginity. It should be in the curriculum of every business school that has a center for entrepreneurship -- if only to prove that the \\"traditional\\" route to starting and running a business is not the only way.<br />While his methods may have been unorthodox at times, Branson more than makes up for it with tenacity, guile and just plain guts. His story is the classic David and Goliath tale. Now he's the humble Goliath.<br />What I most like about this book though is that Branson pulls no punches -- even when it comes to his own failings. He outlines his bad decisions (along with the good) sometimes in great detail, taking full credit for the debacle. But through it all he finds his way out of trouble by re-inventing himself and never, ever giving up. He's a Navy Seal, an Army Ranger and a Green Beret wrapped up in an Oxford pullover sweater. He is self-deprecating at times, if only to show us that -- all of the above notwithstanding -- he's just like us.<br />I am not sure if this book could ever be used as a primer on how to start a mega-conglomerate of businesses, but I do know one thing: I WANT TO BE RICHARD BRANSON!
B000002JPA|3.0|The general complain of those who don´t like Dream Theater verym uch is that their music, altough viruoso and majestic and technically perfect, does not have bal...s, they are not rock.<BR>Unfortunately, I must agree with those critics.<br />Petrucci´s playing is soulless, but at least it´s clear the guy can play anything. But greatest trouble is this singer, James LaBrie. God, he´s utterly bad, a kind of Gary Cherone meets Elton John, something that awful!!! His voice is annoying, it´s a shame to see four magic musicians having their work damaged by such an obnoxious voice. I know, he´s in Dream Theater until today, but that not makes him any better, in my opinion.<br />Get another singer, and IMAGES AND WORDS would have four stars from me.
B00004XONN|4.0|'Kid A' is a very soothing release musically.  What is amazing though is that it still sounds ominous at times, and the music somehow oozes into your consciousness it is so monotone at times.  Nonetheless, it is so very original, I believe it to be, along with The Church 'After Everything Now This', one of the best and most mesmerizing releases of the past few years!
B00005JKG5|5.0|For a low budget film, Flashdance was an addictive box office smash. I must have seen this film at LEAST 15 times when it played in the cinemas. All right, the plot was a little weak but it had strong female characters, a great soundtrack, and fantastic dancing! &quot;Watchman-on-the-wall&quot; should get off his God trip and keep his preaching in the church. This is great entertainment for anyone who enjoys a good dance movie. I'd be surprised if the DVD release doesn't send more eager students out on the dance floor! A+
0451169514|2.0|Sorry, I've tried...God knows I've tried...but I just can't like this book. There's a lot here to love, but King just throws it all away. It's that idiotic child gang-bang at the end; I just can't get over it. In the space of a few pages, King wipes out the thousand pages of goodness which came before, at least in my eyes. What the heck was the *point* of the scene, anyway? My God, an 11-year-old girl would probably be torn apart by something like that! To me, this book was like falling in love...and then being horribly betrayed at the end of the relationship. Without that little child orgy at the end, I would have given this book five stars, easily. Some people can get past it and still enjoy the book, but I can't. Call me a prude, but child sex ain't my thing....
B00005RRG9|5.0|THE PARENT TRAP gets the deluxe 2-disc treatment in this fabulous new Vault Disney DVD edition!<br />The beloved story based on Erich Kastner's book concerns prim and proper Bostonian Sharon McKendrick and rough 'n' ready Californian chick Susan Evers (both played by Hayley Mills), who discover that they are twins during annual summer camp, and decide to get their divorced parents, Maggie and Mitch (Maureen O'Hara and the late Brian Keith) back together again.<br />Only one thing stands in the way - \\"pluck-faced child-bride\\" Vicki (played to the hilt by the fabulous Joanna Barnes - AUNTIE MAME), who'll do anything to make sure that Mitch is hers and hers alone!  The twins decide to let Vicki have it while Mitch and the girls go on an event-filled wilderness camp-out!<br />This beautiful classic looks better than ever in this THX-approved, reference-quality print.  There is a sparkling-new 5.1 sound mix as well as the classic Donald Duck cartoon \\"Donald's Double Trouble\\" on Disc One, as well as an entertaining commentary with Hayley Mills and director David Swift.<br />Disc Two whisks you into the bowels of the Disney Vaults to see some great archival material, including interviews with Susan Henning-Shutte (Mill's twin-double in the film) and brand-new retrospectives from Hayley Mills, Joanna Barnes and Maureen O'Hara.  There is also a clip from the \\"Disneyland\\" show that shamelessly advertises both THE PARENT TRAP and BABES IN TOYLAND (Disney's two major films released that year), extensive costume and set designs, poster/still gallery and an interview with the Sherman brothers who wrote the songs for the film.<br />A must-own for any true Disney or DVD collector.  (2 single-sided, dual-layer discs).
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's second effort is brilliant. You get a real sense of what they can do music-wise. The band's attitude on 'Parachutes' was sort of 'if you don't mind for a minute we'd like you to listen to some music we think you'll like.' Somewhat apologetic. Nonetheless very good top to bottom. 'Rush of Blood' is the opposite, the band is more confident and assertive with the last song (Amsterdam) showing you how well the lead singer can control his voice yet let you taste how far it can go if he just lets it all hang out...maybe on the next album. Politik, God Put A Smile on Your Face, Warning Sign, the title track &amp; Amsterdam are all great songs. You can feel the passion and honesty in the music. I bought Parachutes &amp; Rush of Blood after not buying a CD for about 5 years, that's how good this music is.
1572700955|5.0|Mansfield Park might indeed be the crowning novel of Jane Austen's cannon; in which all of her authorial merits are present and paramount.  Where Pride and Prejudice sparkles, Mansfield Park is solid gold.  Pride and Prejudice can pass as a whimsy, an entertaining story, but Mansfield Park has pure heart.  It ventures slightly deeper into the human condition and emerges slightly higher, ringing slightly truer than what is often considered to be Austen's most popular novel.<br />For reasons already mentioned, Pride and Prejudice is still my favorite of Austen's books, though Mansfield Park is right up there with it.  It would be like comparing the two heroines of each novel; Elizabeth Bennet and Fanny Price.  Elizabeth is witty and beautiful and idependent; Fanny is good and wholesome and always considerable of what is right.  We, the readers, have more fun tailing after the sparkling Elizabeth, but we admire and advocate Fanny.<br />In short, Mansfield Park is arguably Jane Austen's best and definitely a must-read for Austen and Victorian fans.  And although the cousin-love thing is slightly unnerving to our modern sensibilities, Edmund's final confession can't be rivaled by either Darcy's or Knightly's at all.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Well, we've all heard \\"Don't let me Get me\\", \\"Get the Party Started\\", and \\"Just like a Pill\\" on the radio, and they are great songs!  After hearing \\"Just like a Pill\\" (How did SHE know my ex-boyfriend??) I had to go buy this CD.  And I'm stingy, I don't spend money on just anything!  What I discovered when I listened this CD is that Pink is much more versatile than I gave her credit for.  She's a very talent singer, and she shows her diversity with songs that'll make you cry (Family Portrait, and Lonely Girl), songs that'll make you stand up and cheer (Respect, 18 wheeler, and Eventually), songs that'll make you wonder how she ever got into your mind like that (My Vietnam, and Dear Diary) and songs that you just can't help but sing (Misery, Don't let Me get Me, and Just like a Pill).  She shines on \\"Misery\\", and her vocals are just incredible, but my favorite is \\"My Vietnam\\" because I feel her pain...and I know exactly what she means.  Buy this CD, and develop a deeper respect for Pink, you'll not regret it!
B00006BNDI|5.0|With this album, Burzum ups the ante with this strikingly epic album of emotional atmosphere. Not concerned with time, these songs slowly develop and guide you through the stages of fear, mortality, and eventual death.  These riffs are fairly simple,   but its in its composition and frighteninly painful vocals that no band in the black metal scene has matched. The album title translates to \\"When the light takes us\\", a take on the christian religion ( or light ) assimilating the norse traditions. 8 yrs later, this album is still at the top of black metal, and with the way black metal is plunging these days, will likely continue to be.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters is a fantastic tale of a little girl who gets lost in monster land.  I enjoyed it more than my nieces and nephews.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I cannot believe the average review of this album is 3.5 stars! If, hopefully when, you listen to the album you'll realize how good it is. 'The Modern Age,' 'Someday,' 'Last Nite,' and 'Soma' are the highlights, among so many great songs. Just listen to the album and you'll love it, unless of course you have no taste in music--or like new metal--hell those two things similar...
B000002VCO|3.0|From the title track: \\"...and those who came, at first, to scoff remain behind to pray.\\"  It somehow strikes a cord with my \\"conspiracy theory\\" dominated view of the world at large.  For once you step through that door and BELIEVE that things are not as they seem, there is no turning back.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I love classical music.  I love Metallica.  S&amp;M is the perfect blend of classic and rock.  Metallica adds new depth and character to their amazing selection by adding the orchastra background.  An amazing concert with an amazing cd.

B00006CXSS|5.0|As an avid collector of WWI and WWII movies I found this movie to be the paragon of any war movie to date.  It's like watching 10 different episodes of Saving Private Ryan.  Live interviews are conducted with living members of Easy Company explaining each episode so it's like reliving their hell.  Some of the episodes honestly left me drained of my emotions after watching the personal tradgies and scrafice these men experienced.  You will not be disappointed in this movie.
B00005JK8K|1.0|This movie is full of cliches, bad acting, and gratuitous, stupid violence.  Nicholas Cage becomes the consummate overactor as he unsuccessfully attempts to portray conflicted emotions.  He looks like Bill Shatner's Kirk transplanted into the 1940's Pacific theatre.  It's pathetic and John Woo seems to think that he can cover it up with explosions.  Every five minutes my wife and I would look at each other and say, \\"There hasn't been an explosion for a while,\\" and at that point Woo would indulge us with some more unnecessary pyrotechnics.  The explosions become boring due to the fact that they seem to occur in mind-numbingly large groups.  Eventually you'll conclude that they're just there to wake you up from the coma that you've fallen into as your brain punishes you for watching this film.<br />But ultimately, the explosions aren't able to distract from the horrible war-movie dialog.  One guy actually gives his wedding ring to a buddy with the request that it be given to his wife because he has a premonition of dying.  The buddy, of course, gives it back and says, \\"No man, you're gonna live.\\"  Guess who dies in the next scene.  Ditto with the infantryman carrying the flame thrower who says, \\"I'm wearing a Zippo lighter on my back!\\"  There were many others, but my mind has prevailed in deleting them from memory.  Thank goodness.<br />No, wait!  I almost forgot!  The Japanese soldiers!  Their attack method is to run at you until you shoot them dead!  Will they fire at you?  Who cares?  Their aim is worse than any Star Wars Storm Trooper!  It turns out that our fighting men didn't do such a mighty thing defeating the Japanese Empire because none of their soldiers could kill you.  Thanks for that insight, John Woo!
B000000Y87|3.0|Do not buy this version of SUNDAY AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD! Buy the 20-bit remastered version.    What infuriates me about this version is that Riverside, in its infinite wisdom, chose to include alternate takes of four songs (\\"Gloria's Step,\\" Alice in Wonderland,\\" \\"All of You\\" and \\"Jade Visions) and sequence them back-to-back with the previously released versions. Sure, it's great to have bonus tracks, but let's not violate the original sequence of one of jazz music's most beloved albums! Save the bonus tracks for the end or put them on a separate disc. Duh.    Get a clue, Riverside! You've painted a moustache on the Mona Lisa.
0140042520|5.0|This book, by far, is the best of all Kerouac put into one. I greatly enjoyed On The Road (I read it four times in a span of 3 months) but Dharma Bums definitely takes the cake. This masterpiece reeks of Kerouac; superb and exciting storyline, upBEAT characters and fast paced action, wonderful poetic imagery as well as fanatstic humoristic moments. This is a Kerouac gem and anyone who digs Jack should definitely get their hands on this one, even it comes down to selling a kidney or what not. A literary masterpiece!
B00006J3T4|1.0|Judging from the other reviews I'm very much in the minority here but I was very disappointed with this follow up to Sailing. Mark is a huge talent and if he wants to make an esoteric album that's fine, but I wish I had had some warning before plunking down my hard earned bucks for this turkey. Just too personal and quirky for my tastes. Destined for immediate obscurity.
0316666343|1.0|I thought this book took a very serious subject and made light of it.  I found it very depressing and could not believe the comments on the cover after I finished reading the entire book.  There was nothing funny about it and did not find it well written.  Was very shocked at the reviews and awards.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is perhaps the best DVD set I've ever bought.  I was very surprised at how cheap it was for a two disk set!  The movie is fabulous and owning it on DVD absolutely rocks.  But there is so much more on the disks that makes this worth your while.<br />First, let me say that if you're a techie, don't watch the segment on how they made it until you enjoy the movie one last time.  During the short feature where they take you inside Pixar, they go into vivid detail on how they did a lot of the elements of the movie.  I was so amazed by this, I found myself watching Sully's fur for a long time during the movie.  They also included some of the initial tests they did to work on the interaction of the monsters and their environment.<br />Also on the second disk is a new animated short called \\"Mike's New Car\\".  It's hilarious.  Their are games, a tour of monstropolis, outtakes, and more,  making this the ultimate DVD movie experience.
B000001FMX|5.0|It's hard to believe that any self-respecting rock fan would actually give this album anything less than five stars - it's simply perfect.<BR> There's already so many reviews here giving the details, so to cut to the chase let me just add a few points: 1) David Johanson was an incredibly charismatic frontman, his lyrics abounding with brilliant, trashy wit; 2) Johnny Thunders' guitar licks are worth all the praise one hears of him - the inventiveness of his electrifying, divebombing guitar style runs rampant throughout this disc; 3) the overall songwriting on their debut is awesomely consistent - every song here is a killer, everyone a classic; 4) this album hasn't dated a second since its release, if not now sounding more alive and vital than ever; and 5) this platter is an absolutely essential purchase if you're at all inclined towards pure rock'n'roll a la \\"Nuggets\\", Velvets, 'Stones, Yardbirds, Stooges, MC5, Sex Pistols, Damned, Black Flag, Germs, etc., or if you're just a newcomer to the scene brought in by the current popularity of bands like the White Stripes, Strokes, etc. If so, then dig in here to get the roots of where your faves are coming from.<BR> If it wasn't for the fact that every critic and his mother constantly hails this as one of rock's all-time essential meisterwerks, I'd say it's possibly the most under-rated album of all time; as it stands, I'll simply say that its sheer brilliance is still greatly undervalued by the general record-buying public, OK?

0316666343|5.0|I started reading this book on the way to Louisiana to go gambling, and I could not put it down, even when we were on the way to the casino. It was a great book. I loved it and I suggest everyone read it, give it a chance. If you have recently lost someone close to you, it truly makes you wonder about the afterlife. Definitly worth the read.
0449227421|3.0|This was my first Follet novel. I read lots of genetic thrillers and my mother had given me this book a year or two ago.  So, let me try and come up with a fair description: Michael Crichton meets Robin Cook with a flair of Dean Koontz.  Well written?  Well, it's fast paced, but unfortunately, the title gives away 3/4 of the book.  I wanted to kick myself for realizing it so fast.  Still, Ken Follet has an enjoyable tale-telling style.  The book had two loveable characters and some heart pounding drama. <br />The last 1/4 of &quot;The Third Twin&quot; was not as predictable as I expected. There were plenty of last moment dramas to keep me satisfied to the end.  In all, I would say...read it for a fast two-night read, or read it if you are a fan of genetic scandal.<BR>If you find this review helpful and are a fan of genetic suspense, please feel free to email me with other suggestions.<BR>I always write back. :)

B000069HK2|5.0|This cd is absolutely amazing. I can't think of anything bad to say about it. My friend bought it, we listened to it, and i was hooked. I ran out and bought it the next day. Bert McCracken(the singer) has one of the best singing and screaming voices have ever. I was amazed when i heard it. I recommend it to anyone... i give this cd 800 thumbs up! :)
0151008116|3.0|I must preface these comments by saying that I read Yann Martel's yarn after hearing nothing but raving reviews.  In particlular, that it was &quot;extrememly deep&quot; and &quot;will make you think for weeks&quot;.  The jacket cover and introduction gave the same impression, with their (unhelpfully) ironic statements about making the reader a believer in God.  <br />Without recounting the story, which has been done several times here, I'll get right to the point.  The allegory is laid a little too thick.  And Pi is just a little too cute for my tastes.  It all gets tiresome after a while.  <br />That being said, there are some beautifully descriptive passages and it's an entertaining tale.  But when finished, it disappears like fog under a burning Pacific sun.
B000066NW0|5.0|Gee, guys! Everyone is trying to be so introspective and deep concerning her lyrics, mood, lifesytle, image, etc. WHO CARES! Most of the songs (I've not listened to every one of them as I have been downloading them from BearShare) have been very entertaining. The two megahits are catchy. The rap song I've already deleted. I'm downloading 3 more tonight. \\"Anything but ordinary\\" is top-notch. Forget the flimsy lyrics. Not every song has to be bone-deep.<br />Take her for what she is. Avril. Not Britney, Alanis, BABWA, Michelle, etc. RELAX and enjoy the fun. Some of you guys tend to lose the trees for the forest.<br />KRM<br />PS- For what it's worth, I like Michelle Branch as well. I enjoy a female artist with a bit of edge/bite to her voice, but not a manic-depressive like Alanis. Sarah McLachlan falls into the good catagory as well. (where is that girl nowdays?)
B00006F7S4|5.0|I love this record.  Don't buy this disc if you want to be spiritually uplifted though; this record is heartbreakingly sad.  From stem to stern this disc sends the message that Mr. Hansen is bummed, but it's so well done.  Wonderful arrangements, and none of Beck's patented arty screech noise to break the spell.
2877060519|5.0|Awesome book!  If you speak french or in the process of learning french its a great book to read.  He paints a very good picture of the country side back in the late 19th century.  Also if u liked this on don't forget to get La Gloire de mon Pere which is just as good as this one.  Enjoy!
1565847032|5.0|This is a great collection of Chomsky material in a conversational style.  Although I'm sure all readers of Chomsky will enjoy this, I would especially recommend it to someone just being introtuced to his work.  It is a very informative read, and because of it's format, you don't have to read from cover to cover.
0060920386|4.0|This is an amazingly thorough account of the RJR/Nabisco LBO story of the late 80s.  It does a good job of noting the influence of junk bonds, the pervasive greed in the culture of wall street, and the complex wranglings associated with a buyout.  The book is exceptionally readable.<br />My main criticisms are (1) it is too thorough: it is easy to tire of the endless discussions-of-only-minor-substance between some of the parties; many of these conversations sound the same and it quickly becomes something one would rather skim over and (2) the book, while providing some basic education on LBOs, doesn't address some of the details as well as it could.  For example, there is no detailed explanation of how junk bonds work or what rules goven the ownership of public or private companies.  I had to turn elsewhere for such info and I think that the authors could easily complement what they already have with such material.<br />Nonetheless, if there is one book about Wall St in the mid/late 80s you should read, it should be this one.
B00003CXAE|2.0|Grease is one of the best movies of the '70's. No doubt about that.<BR>WHAT HAPPENED PARAMOUNT?????<BR>The movie is great as always but the DVD edition is badly dissapointing.  The dolby soundtrack is better on the 20th Anniversary Edition I bought a few years ago.<BR>I am VERY dissapointed in the quality I have of this. I will keep it just because it is the DVD of the movie. But for watching, I'll bring out the old 20th Anniversary VHS edition.<BR>Hope Paramount does better with Saturday Night Fever and Footllose.
B000046PVN|4.0|Yeah, that's right- in 1978 he had already done a better score for Star Wars, and the best was yet to come. <BR>Sorry to those folks who give this a maximum rating, but any composer's fan notice that this isn't the peak of his originilaty. This one, even, gets repetitive at some tracks, yet it's amazing how it still sounds good thanks to the length of the mov. <BR>The good things are that it sounds very epic, and equal to the mov, Rhino has made a good job, showing finally all the music. <BR>This reflects quite good the Superman's course of life since Krypton, until he defeats Lex Luthor.<br />CD1:<BR>\\"Prelude and Main Title\\" is the more associated to the mov, it presents the march of hope and vitory of Superman. (What a feel each time I hear it!)<BR>\\"The Planet Krypton\\" presents the planet with some darker tones at the sentence of the criminals.<BR>Other themes: \\"Destrution Of krypton\\"(moving music of the farewell), Star ship Escapes\\", \\"The Trip To Earth\\"(very soft and very good).<BR>Tracks Smallville \\"Growing Up\\", Death of Jonathan Kent\\", \\"Leaving Home\\"(sad)<BR>As many say it's good that \\"Fortress Of Solitude\\" is now complete, and it has a real fairy tale touch.<BR>Metropolis: \\"Welcome To Metroplis\\" (presentation of the love theme), Lex Luthor's Lair (presentation of that delicious and bumbling theme for the villains), The Big Rescue (Superman appears, one of the best tracks), \\"Super Crime Fighter\\", \\"Super rescues\\"(variations of the main theme)<BR>CD2:<BR>\\"The Terrace\\", \\"Flying Sequence\\" (long, beautiful way to fly listening to this music), \\"Lois and Clark\\".<BR>\\"Crime of the Century\\"(funny variation of the villains march), \\"Sonic Greeting\\" (Superman arrives at Luthor's Lair)<BR>There are a lot of action tracks- 8, 9, 10 and 11, some better, some sound too similar, but at this point the soundtrack begins to be a bit repetitive.<BR>\\"Turning Back the World\\" is really good, using a fast and beautiful orchestration of the love theme as the only way to save Lois.<BR>Thescore ends with a reprise of the main theme and the love theme. <br />Overall a very good soundtrack, that leaves us with a good feeling after hear it, yet I think there are a lot of needless bonus tracks that makes us pay more money. <BR>Only for fans of Superman, since Star Wars or Indiana Jones fans will find it quite different.
0452282152|2.0|I heard so much about this book but I felt that not only were the characters underdeveloped but the story was as well. I kept waiting for something, anything, to happen, and nothing ever did.<BR>There were so many directions she could have taken this simple story, and instead it led disappointingly nowhere.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|...to accompany a great movie! It was worth the [money] just to be able to hear Ewan McGregor's cover of \\"Your Song\\" over and over, but it doesnt stop there.  Bowie's versions of \\"Nature Boy\\" are great, as are the countless other covers and medleys, which are recreated here with a unique and imaginative twist. If you have seen the movie and loved it as much as I did, then this album is a must-have. If you haven't seen the movie...what are you waiting for?! You will be pleasantly surprised.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Written and Directed by Richard Kelly (ASIN: B00005V3Z4) <BR> <BR> Any reviewer would be hard-pressed to discuss this film without giving away significant details. Donnie Darko is a snake eating its own tail, a story where the circularity of the plot is an integral part of its enjoyment, and so many seemingly insignificant moments through the film prove crucial to the end result, a kind of dark surprise different from any of the tired twists found in recent big-budget films. <br /> It is 1988. A borderline schizophrenic teenaged boy, Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is haunted by visions of a man-sized rabbit named Frank. In addition to the prophetic announcement that the world will end in &quot;28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, 12 seconds,&quot; Frank forces Donnie to commit a series of increasingly serious misdeeds.<BR> <BR> As if this is not enough, a crash course in Einstein-Rosen bridges aka wormholes by physics teacher Dr. Kenneth Monnitoff (Noah Wyle,) along with a copy of The Philosophy of Time Travel, convinces Donnie that a &quot;fourth dimensional construct&quot; has touched down right in his home town, allowing him to see such apparently hallucinatory events as streams of computer-generated liquid that hint at people's intentions.<br /> Set to an eclectic 1980s soundtrack, and also starring Drew Barrymore (producer for this project,) Mary McDonnell and yes, Patrick Swayze, Donnie Darko is deliberately vague as to its genre--the film moves effortlessly from horror to science fiction to psychological drama, and does so successfully. The setting is vintage to the time period, but not prone to the heavy-handed display of era-specific props as other near-period pieces.<br /> The DVD (from CBS/Fox Home Video) contains the 113 minute feature film in anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1,) deleted scenes, theatrical trailer, director's commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal, the The Philosophy of Time Travel, music video for covered 80s song &quot;Mad World&quot; and an art gallerywith production skills. <br /> This review is for the Region 1 encoded DVD with English and Spanish subtitles and English and French Dolby surround.
0316236535|2.0|Our two year old never had any problems with playing/sleeping in her room until this book about the monster with the sharp teeth was read to her in a class. Now she gets scared and yells out \\"Monster!\\" This has been on a daily basis since exposure to the book two weeks ago. Sure the book ends with telling the monster to go away, but this affirms that monsters exist in the first place. Even though other reviewers have had no issues, based on our personal experience we would caution on reading to the very young.
B000002UB6|5.0|This is my favorite Beatles album ever, and I have heard all of them. In my opinion this album represents the Beatles in one last stage, that being a complete transformation out of pop and into rock. Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper were rock-driven, but many of the songs (see: Drive My Car, In My Life, When Im 64) were downright popish. But on this album and on Abbey Road (reocorded later but released earlier, as you all certainly know)the Beatles are straight-up, 100 proof, no exceptions, ROCK. This album contains 2 of Paul's best and lyrically deepest ballads ever: \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road.\\" A listen at \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"Dig a Pony\\" shows that John was no slouch when it came to down to penning a good song with meaning and performing it. George shows his sensitive side with the heartfelt \\"For You Blue.\\" And The Beatles, despite reality, sound like a real, together, BAND in \\"Two of Us\\" \\"Get Back\\" and \\"I've got a Feeling.\\" Without the media, who would have known John and Paul were all but split seperate directions?<br />Track by track rating 1-5 stars<br />1. Two Of Us * * * * * Beautiful and absolutely perfect acoustic number with John and Paul crooning together<BR>2. Dig A Pony * * * * * John in all of his brilliant madness<BR>3. Across The Universe * * * * * Has become a hippie/acid anthem. Often covered, but none resemble John's exquisite pitches<BR>4. I Me Mine * * * * * Only bad thing about this track is how short it is. Lyrically, George seems to have taken a hint from John, but its his vocals that make it haunting. <BR>5. Dig It * * * Funny, clever, but under a minute long. A sort of interlude.<BR>6. Let It Be * * * * * What can I say, sometimes even I'm a sucker for Paul's simple, great-sounding ballads.<BR>7. Maggie Mae * * * Catchy; could have been something but it fades into nothing in about a minute.<BR>8. I've Got A Feeling * * * * * Love Paul's lead vocals and John's fill-ins near the end.<BR>9. One After 909 * * * * A step belowthe other full-length tracks here, but still a nice inclusion on any CD.<BR>10. Long And Winding Road * * * * * A little sappy at times but overall a nice ballad that grows on you and is tearful at the end.<BR>11. For You Blue * * * * * Simple, exquisite. Godspeed, George.<BR>12. Get Back * * * * Kind of like a twisted, rocking version of \\"Ob La Dee Ob La Da\\" minus the keyboards. Great recording.

B00005RHGL|5.0|This 1993 western may have received mixed reviews from critics when it was released, but it has since become a cult classic film that is still great movie that even people who don't like westerns can enjoy.  The film is carried at a rather nice pace, and the sublime casting of Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday makes Tombstone work.  Kilmer turns in his best performance, while Kurt Russell turns in a near equally great performance as Wyatt Earp.  The huge ensemble cast includes Sam Elliot, Bill Paxton, Michael Biehn, Powers Boothe, Dana Delany, Jason Priestly, Billy Zane, Billy Bob Thornton, Michael Rooker, John Corbett, Thomas Haden Church, Stephen Lang, Robert John Burke, Charlton Heston, and the voice of Robert Mitchum in major and supporting roles, along with some great gunfights and brilliant set design all help Tombstone be a feast of the senses.  If you already own Tombstone on video or on the older edition DVD, then seriously consider upgrading to this new edition Vista Series DVD set, the extras are great and well put together, and Tombstone is one of the best action films I have ever seen.
1577311523|5.0|It's all about being in the moment.  \\"The Power of Now\\" is a profoundly<BR>simple approach to enlightenment.  Written in a straightforward question<BR>and answer format, this book uncovers the simple secret to living an<BR>extraordinary life.  Simply being in the present without judgment is all<BR>that it takes.  It is our minds, our egos that make it difficult.  When you<BR>identify yourself with the drama you have created you lose touch with your<BR>truth and your life will suffer.<br />Through my personal contact with Ariel and Shya Kane I have woken up to<BR>this way of being and the magic life has to offer.  Their book \\"Working on<BR>Yourself Doesn't Work\\" is a must read for anyone looking for answers.
B00005JLRR|4.0|Well let's hope that John Logan and Brent Spiner have written a good screenplay. After seeing both trailers, the film looks very interesting, but there appears to be too much immitation of previous installments . <BR>   Like Star Trek VI, it's the last we see of all the TNG crew together. Second,the plot has to do with a federation treaty with romulus (hence the klingon/federation treaty in IV). Forthermore, it follows in the footsteps of Star Wars Episode: II, with the cloning of a younger Picard (Shinzon played by Tom Hardy) and (B-9) another Data clone. Even more interesting is the comparisons to Star Trek II, where were supposed to believe that Shinzon (Tom Hardy's character) is supposed to be the greatest villian since Khan, and heres a MAJOR SPOILER for those non trek fans, one of are beloved characters is to die (Mr. Data); much like the death of Mr. Spock! Maybe I'm just paranoid, but there are too many comparisons to other sci-fi films. I could go on and on about how the writers have borrowed from other films. <BR>   I will still go and see this movie because I'm a sucker for TNG and Trek in general, but I'm not I'm going to like it that much. Hell, it was supposed to run 3 hours approximately, until Paramount decided to cut out about an hour and a half; because it really didn't relate to the films plot. I believe that for the fans sake, they should not have tampered with the running time,nor should they have gone with Shinzon as their main nemesis. <BR>   There would have been a much greater comparison to Khan if they'd used Q,Commander Sela, and Lore as their main villians. Giving us fans a much greater anticipation for the film, and perhaps more of a continuence in TNG unresolved conflict storylines.<BR>   In closing, I believe that Nemesis could have been better. Yeah sure there are cameos by Guinan,Wesley (now deleted from the film), and Janeway. But don't you think that with three great villians Q, Sela, Lore, and cameos by Barclay, Lwaxana, and evenDr. Pulowski; that there would be a greater closure to the Next Generation. I had my dream TNG film finale implanted for years, perhaps my dream was far to expensive. But, it sure would have made a great Star Trek film, perhaps even the greatest Trek film. Here's to the dream.....
0385503954|4.0|Absolutely beautiful, but . . . This book is elegantly written.  Unfortunately, most of us read books today for the story, or at least the pace of story development.  Not a criticism but a fact of life in today's world in which the various forms of video entertainment make plowing through a book seem 'slow'.  There is no reward here for the reader seeking a fast paced thriller.  But if you chew on your prose and enjoy skillfully phrased and artistic prose, as I do, then you will love this work of art.  Frankly, McEwan intimidates me at times with his mastery of the language.  Unfortunately, his story will appeal to a limited readership.  Frankly, if you are in the club, ain't it grand.  To the rest, maybe you don't know what you are missing.

B00004Z459|5.0|Here is an overview of the songs on LP's Hybrid Theory:<br />1. Papercut - The start of the CD begins with a really neat beat then switches to some light guitar chords then a heavy riff, immediately followed by an aggressive rap from Mike Shinoda. The chorus is a rap/sing/yell : ) kind of tone that really sets off the mood! Absolutely great background scratching, heavy riffs, and one of the best bridges(after the last verse and the chorus after that) on the album. Cons: Lyrics in choruses might sound a bit too muffled, song may get tedious. Grade: 90%<br />2. One Step Closer - A big riff at the start, then a verse from Chester. The chorus is great and aggressive, and again sets the mood 'I'm about to break!'. The bridge here, &quot;SHUT UP!' in a nutshell, is quite weak, with annoying scratches, but other than that, this song is immensely strong! Grade: 93%<br />3.With You- Very original sampling and riff at the start. Then goes into scratches and sampling with Shinoda's looming voice. The chorus is yelling from Chester (a great voice), some great minor key guitar chords, and the scratching is still eminent in the chorus, too! The bridge is Chester and heavy guitar and some really descriptive lyrics. The ending sample is cool. Grade: 95%<br />4. Points of Authority - Great introduction rap. Slightly weak voice from Chester but strengthened by the great guitars in the background. The chorus is yelling again, but is really catchy. The background sampling can be slightly corny, but then is re-enforced by Shinoda's excellent rap from the intro! Grade: 85%<br />5-Crawling- What can I say...absolutely breathtaking! A quiet intro with a techno beat, cresendoing to a hard riff and Chester Bennington screaming in almost genuine anguish. Very catchy. The verses have lots of heart put into it, lyrically(words) and the voice is tremendously fitting for the song(tone) and overall just amazing talent. Awesome bass in verses and bridge especially. Listen to the drums during the choruses! It is so COOL! Small rap before choruses courtesy Mike Shinoda! The best song on the album...Stirs your emotions in a way you would not think possible! Grade: 100%<br />6.Runaway - I cool riff at the starts and samplings pretty good. Verses are good and the singing is great. Mike Shinoda provides a small rap almost like he is of like mind with Chester. Bridge is really tedious and boring. Chester's voice is too drawn out, but then quickly comes back to the chorus. Overall quite good! Grade: 88%<br />7. By Myself - Heaviest song on the album...Mellow sampling and scratching in verses followed by a building verse by Shinoda, well rapped and rhymed. The chorus is just excellent, showing off the talents of both vocalists! Great guitaring on this song! This bridge is THE best on the album, with Mike starting off with a rap, then Chester Bennington comes with some screams and the guitars are still there accompanied by the sample from the verses. A truly great rap/metal song! Grade: 97%<br />8. In the End - Very emotional song. Starts with a haunting piano tune and scratching, then switches to a rap by Shinoda, accompanied by Chester's singing talent. The chorus is a hard hitting one, with Chester singing, hard guitar riffs, and great drums. Amazing drums in this song and throughout the album. A fine bridge that really displays the singing talents of Bennington. Grade: 99%<br />9. Place for My Head - Really cool guitar chording at the start then a beat with some scratches followed by a hard hitting guitar and rapping duo! The chorus, however, is a bit lacking of catchiness of the verses and also the intensity is not there. The song improves through to the finish, ending up to be a good song! Grade: 89%<br />10. Forgotten - Starts right out with catchy, hard hitting chorus with heavy guitars! The rap is truly ingenious in its wording with a mellow sample as a backdrop! There is also an add onto the chorus, which is really good with some catchy minor guitar chords. The drums are very good on this one! The bridge starts with some scratches and a rap but then rises in intensity to the end chorus! Great bass too! Grade: 96%<br />11. Cure for the Itch - A kind of corny intro by Mike, but the freestyle scratching by DJ Joseph Hahn! Be sure to listen to it! Very cool! Grade: 90%<br />12. Pushing Me Away - Starts out with a really cool riff, then quiets down to some great singing by Chester, accompanied by some rapped lines by Shinoda. The chorus has good lyrics, and has great bass and electric guitars! Not to mention a great beat! The bridge is truly great and Chester and Mike's blend of voices are just great! The outcome is a very emotional song! Grade: 97%<BR> <BR>Overall Grade for Hybrid Theory: 97%

0345350499|5.0|This book was filled with such detail that it was as if i were watching tv. It reavled many things from the days of Arthur.
B000069HKH|5.0|I, like many of my generation was hit with Springsteen bug when \\"Born in the USA\\" took the world by storm. The song had no relevance to people born outside the US, but the frenzy it created was unbelievable. It was a defining movement in his career. People, who still cared about him, dug into his back catalog and hung on to The River and struggled with his Nebraska. Others left when he abandoned the E-Street and went his way into the Tunnel of Love. He was destined to settle into adult-contemporary genre with his later works. He emerged once in a while with a political message like murder incorporated. He tried to be angry, a liberal, a folk singer and a rock star, he seemed to fill the role perfectly. You were looking forward for the next greatest hits album.<br />All that changes with the new album, where he shines as an artist conveying his distress and express it in a medium he is a master in. It is a culmination of e-street band's excellent musicianship, traditional rock music with a contemporary production, every song being delivered like their lives depended on it. The album is a like a ritual experience in the landscape of musical art form. The accomplishment is in making you share the emotion. As disturbing as it may be, it seems to make sense that a loss of this magnitude, a re-union after a decade, many years of creative mediocrity and passing of youth was required to make \\"The rising\\". <br />In this modern age of information, where every point of view has been explored and published, you might wonder what is left to say, except your point of view. But it would be pretentious to assume that your point of view is important and your understanding is any better. Springsteen seems to understand that and suffer the same limitations you and me have. The beauty is for a man of his stature as writer and political commentator to reveal his vulnerability and still trying to explain the inexplicable through his songs. <br />The most disturbing thing about loss is itis unique to the person who is grieving. It cannot be shared as they say, though you can try to understand it with effort and show that you care. In process of understanding you can help the healing process of others. This album is like a friend who tries to understand and might help the people who really lost pieces of their lives (in this case the families of the sep 11th) and for others to appreciate what we have left.
B00000DLVA|5.0|I'm tired of hearing people say that true Cardies fans only get this album to finish off their collection.  I am a true Cardigans fan, and I think this album is the best!  It is the mark of all great bands and artists for their music to grow and change.  Obviously, growing and changeing does not please some fans, but to heck with them!  If you like Garbage, Bush, and music like that, Gran Turismo is the CD for you.  If you are ever blessed with a long stretch of freeway to speed on, My Favourite Game is perfect for putting the pedal to the metal and zooming along.  This album is a must for any music collection.
B00006F7S4|1.0|I have never heard such a boring CD in my life. I loved &quot;Mutations&quot; -- especially &quot;Nobody's fault....but my own...&quot; -- this CD however is flat. A dud. I have listened to it over and over again wanting to love it. Sadly, I don't. The songs never get anywhere. They don't cast a spell. Hey, I like mellow music -- love Nick Drake, Tim Buckley, later Talk Talk, Bert Jansch, -- but this is just missing something. Ok, songs #1 and #10 are good and enjoyable...but the rest just never get off the ground, feel mundane, and tired. Sorry. I love Beck's other stuff and I admire him for making this album which is clearly heart-felt. I just don't like it...except for zoning out in a bad way.

B000069CWE|4.0|Alright.  This is completely different from Hybrid Theory.  Some songs have been butchered and torn into worthless junk (In the End and Papercut are some examples).  It is worth buying for several reasons though.  One is the fact that a few songs are good enough too take this cd all the way.  They are Krwlng, 1stpklosr, and Plc4myhd.  These three, along with some others, make the cd worthwhile.  Buy this cd if you don't mind a lot of rap
B00004Z459|5.0|What type of music is this?  I asked my partner this and he just stared for a few minutes and said &quot;alternative&quot;.  Not really, it more like the title suggests: a hybred of several forms of popular music -- rap, rock, grunge.  I loved &quot;In the End&quot; when I heard it and after some friends about Linkin Park I decided to get this for myself.  I was not disappointed.  I love how well the rap goes with the singing, both leads do a wonderful job of blending their talents and the rough techno edge of the instruments.

0385334176|2.0|After hearing so many extraordinary things about Kurt Vonnegut, particularly about Cat's Cradle, I jumped with delight when I saw Deadeye Dick selling for [$] at a used bookstand in NY. I'm beginning to wonder whether or not I could have used that [$] for something better. <br />I was thoroughly encapsulated by Vonnegut's unique style and honesty throughout his introduction and the first few chapters of the novel, which I later found was the best part. I felt as if the entire novel was a setup for some plot that was going to develop, but when I reached the end I realized that that was it. Not to mention that the only character with any character at all was Rudy's father. Yeah, yeah, the book had societal symbolism and isolated incidents that stood on their own without a plot, but the story in which they were presented literally had no point and went absolutely nowhere, therefore diluting the value of those rare gems of scenes. In addition, most of the dialogue seemed forced, melodramatic, and unrealistic at times. Novels about nothing can be good reads, but for some reason Vonnegut missed the mark. Tom Robbins and John Irving are much better at accomplishing a realistic sense of grotesque absurdity in their symbolism of the world.<br />I will give Vonnegut a second chance and will read Cat's Cradle. I hope I have a better experience.
B00005IC2H|3.0|Well I don't really know what to say. It's alright I guess. Kid A is much better, as well as Amnesiac, as well as everything by Bowie, Nick Cave, Eno. <BR>What I mean is that I've had this CD for almost a year now, and I HAVEN'T EVEN LISTENED TO IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH YET!! I get so bored after a while, and I AM SO SICK OF PEOPLE ACTING LIKE THIS IS ALBUM IS THE NEW MESSIAH. It's very pedestrian almost. Brian Eno, Autchere, Aphex Twin have all made albums more \\"etheral\\" and \\"gorgeous\\" than this 10 years ago. (I'm talking about Apollo, LP5, Selected Ambient Works II). Jimmy Page was playing his guitar with a bow in the 60's too. <BR>Techically any band is capable of making the same sound. Throw in some strings, weak drums, bass, an EBow, and whiny falsetto vocals and you got Sigor Ros. <BR>This is also an incredible poseur album. You are not cool becuase you listen to a My Bloody Valentine ... who sings in Icelandic. I couldn't imagine seeing Sigor Ros live. Do you sleep to this stuff? Dancing must be quite hard when the fastest song is at about 45 bpm.
0684800713|5.0|I loved A Farewell to Arms and enjoyed The Old Man and the Sea, but The Sun Also Rises augments itself to the top of the pile of Hemingway's great works. This is the novel that established Hemingway as a genius and as the voice of the Lost Generation subsequent to \\"The War To End All Wars.\\"<br />What makes this my favorite Hemingway and one of my all-time favs is Hemingway's amazing use of dialogue - unparalleled in American literature. The many drunken conversations between the morally devoid, yet likable characters Brett, Jake, and the gang are entertaining and extremely well-written.<br />The Sun Also Rises brilliantly captures the intense disillusionment, aloofness, nihilism, and detachment of Hemingway's Lost Generation from American mainstream society resulting from the horrors and emptiness of WWI.
0316666343|4.0|Very different book where childhood intermingles with murder.  Narrated by a 14 year old victim - this story captivates you with the descriptive \\"through the eyes of a child\\" experiences.  Delivers powerful feeling and captivates the reader through our curiosity of what we may experience after our lives on earth end.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I cannot possibly say enough good things about 30 Seconds To Mars.  This album is virtually perfect in every facet.  Leto's songwriting is immaculate and his vocals are both totally unique and powerful.  The use of synthesizers is not overdone and they get the effects they need without resorting to a rap-style DJ.  The use of dynamics is not only incredibly rare in this day of sonic mediocrity, but also done with the skill of a classical music composer.  The album is a treat from start to finish. Buy it.  today.  You won't be disapointed.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second album Ride the Lightning is the best one so far.  It helped to define the thrash metal genre.  If you want to get only one thrash metal album, be it this one.  It is an all out attack on your senses(besides Fade to Black)with James' and Kirt's awesomely excellent heavy guitars, Cliff's poundingly awesome bass, and Lars' trademark drums.  The best songs on it are Ride the Lightning, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Escape, and Creeping Death.  It also includes an instrumental with Dave Mustaine(death to Megadeth!)which is not even worth listening to, but leave that out and you have the best thrash metal album ever.  If you like it, buy Master of Puppets and ...And Justice for All.  Whatever you do do not get Load or Reload because they are mainstream pieces of pop filth.  Thankyou and have a good listen.
6305897786|5.0|First off, this movie isn't for everyone. People who love a good story and development of atmosphere and character will enjoy this movie, while those that expect explosions and special effects will be greatly disappointed. You really have to be a patient viewer to truly love this film like I do. After multiple viewings you discover nuances and hidden meanings and symbolism that are everywhere throughout the film. Many get pissed about the ending, as I did upon first viewing, but the second time I watched it, I understood more of the story and it's hidden meanings, and then the ending became clear to me and I knew why Polanski ended the movie like he did. Sometimes less is more. <br />Many don't like the pacing of the movie, for Polanski uses many developing shots and slow pans and dollies, but this is effective in creating a certain uneasiness and atmosphere.<br />Polanski is much like Kubrik in his attention to detail and buildup of atmosphere and character, and not all viewers are accustomed to this style or care for it. It all comes down to personal preference I suppose.<br />The DVD is loaded with extras including commentary by Polanski which was very insightful. Highly recommended. If you like the movie also check out the book \\"The Club Dumas\\" by Arturo Perez-Reverte, it is much more complex and involving than the movie, a great book.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Monsters, Inc. stars Sully (John Goodman) and Mike (Billy Crystal).  The two work for Monsters, Inc, a company that produces power by scaring children in their rooms and capturing their screams.  However, children are extremely dangerous to the monsters.  One touch from a child can kill a monster.  Boo, a little girl, manages to sneak through her closet door and into Monsters, Inc unnoticed.  She is soon discovered by Mike and Sully, who must find a way to get her back safely in her room while keeping her out of sight of the other monsters, especially Randall (Steve Buscemi), who is Sully's biggest rival.  What follows is numerous laughs and close calls as Mike, Sully, and Boo try to outsmart the others.  <br />This is a fun movie for adults as well as children.  Boo is your typical toddler; curious, funny, and always trying to get into trouble while Mike and Sully take on the role of surrogate parents as they try to keep Boo from the others. The outtakes at the end of the movie are funny as well.  Overall, this is a very funny and touching film.  The animation and acting are excellent, and the story line will definitely keep both children and adults laughing all the way through.
0780622553|5.0|Alex Proyas really outdid himself with Dark City. His previous work in \\"The Crow\\" was excellent, but Dark City really shows his full potential as a director. From an aesthetic point of view his attention to detail and utilization of light, shadow, and camera movement is astounding. Few have been able to convey a truly dark feeling like Proyas has in this film. <br />All of the actors give great performances, especially Sewell and a suprisingly amusing Sutherland. Willian Hurt gives a detached performance which is brilliant, for the character of Bumstead warrants this detachment. <br />Many will be quick to compare this film to \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"City of Lost Children\\", but I think Dark City is superior in direction and in story. City of Lost Children had some great visuals, but the goofiness of some of the characters in the film really detracted from the atmosphere and mood. The Matrix is a great movie in its own right, but many of the themes seem to be borrowed from Dark City, as they are similar in many aspects.<br />Dark City has been one of my favorites since my first viewing, and the DVD made me love it that much more. The audio commentaries by Proyas and Roger Ebert really help you understand the movie on a higher level and makes you really appreciate the artistry of the film.
B000069I5W|4.0|Patience is the virtue through the first half hour of this movie.  If you can hang tight until the ball starts rolling, you will too. <br /> Robert DeNiro plays a serious and straight forward detective (Mitch), while Eddie Murphy portrays a small time cop (Trey) who has more interest in an acting career.  When Murphy becomes involved in DeNiro's undercover operation, DeNiro gets hot under the collar and breaks a news camera.  DeNiro and Murphy are then forced to team up in a TV police series in order to avoid a law suit from the television station.  Renee Russo (Grace) plays the station's producer who tries to change DeNiro's decor and lifestyle to coincide with public opinion for rating purposes, and DeNiro and Murphy become the rage of the viewing population.<br /> The satire of William Shattner's 1980's TV show \\"T.J. Hooker\\" also shows up in a small part of the movie which consists of a little slapstick humor.  As usual, Eddie Murphy steals the show with his off the wall comedy act, but DeNiro is equally funny playing his straight faced and dry humored character.  Renee Russo and William Shattner are just plain silly.  Although this movie does start out slow, when it picks up it will leave you laughing.
B00006J3T4|3.0|Good thing there's strong coffee to drink while listening to this. Thought-provoking lyrics, but nothing with the passion I'm used to from MK. It's just too sedate. Mark give us some original licks. At least throw in something impressive. Too laid back, sorry.

There will be movies that are better than Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and Lord of the Rings, but there will never, ever, be a movie that can top Goodfella.<br />Unfornutely this amazing movie is paired with an insultingly bad DVD. As if being devoided of features isn't bad enough, it is also a flip disc to boot!! Why isn't there a Superbit or special edition version of this modern classic!?
B00006AFUR|5.0|\\"Under a burning sun, I take a look around, Imagine if this all came down, I'm waiting for the day to come!\\"  With these words, 30 Seconds to Mars delivers an experience unlike any other.  While listening to their self-titled debut album, you are taken away, carried off by the incredible lyrics and sounds.  <br />The energetic headlining song, \\"Capricorn (A Brand New Name),\\" starts the album off with strong and continues on throughout with songs like \\"Buddah for Mary,\\" \\"Oblivion,\\" and \\"93 Million Miles.\\"<br />The final track,\\"Year Zero,\\" starts strong and ends slowly repeating the words, \\"We'll never fade away,\\" into complete silence.<br />Through all the pop rock, rap ..., and asme old garage bands, 30STM creates a unique sound that is all their own.  I highly reccommend this album to anyone young and old.
B000002IZ4|5.0|STP proves themselves a heavyweight band with this release.<br />On PURPLE, we see Weiland and Co. grabbing not for hardhitting riffs so much as credibility with the critics.  They had been roasted with their debut CORE because of the heavy sludge attack of that record.  Stone Temple Pilots were accused of being rather dull copy-cat `artists', learning from Pearl Jam and Nirvana their entire bag of tricks and then replicating it with rather boring results.  CORE's main problem, of course, is it gets very bogged down in the full assault of that heavy grunge sound, and Stone Temple Pilots don't rely on much else to carry the record through.  <br />The critics this time were fairly right.  With the exception of the four singles (Wicked Garden, Sex Type Thing, Creep, and Plush), which stand as some of the very best songs of the early 1990s and as important as anything Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and the other grungies were doing at the time.  These tracks were tempered with melodicism, heavy-hitting music, and a great acoustic sound which rivals even Alice in Chains (who I believe has the best acoustic sound of any of the grunge heavy weights).<br />PURPLE is miles ahead of their debut.  While they still retain the trademark sludge of grunge, they temper it greatly and vary things up enough to make their sound much more interesting, and in the process give the other grunge bands a run for their money.<br />Of course, recrafting your sound does not make the new record any better than the old one unless you have songs to go along with it (Sixteen Stone vs. Razorblade Suitcase).  This is where PURPLE shines.  As far as I'm concerned this record plays like a greatest hits record, or a compilation of essential early 1990s tracks.  Without exception, every song on here is as good as the singles I cited from CORE.  Stone Temple Pilots turned in a set that almost every song sounds like it has the potential to be a radio hit, and while critics and fans may cringe thinking that means they've sold out, Stone Temple Pilots sound their best when they're doing rock that could get on the radio*.  <br />PURPLE sounds much more commercially minded than CORE, but in this case that's not a weakness or artistic compromise.  Instead, PURPLE sounds much more like a band that has at long last come into their signature sound, and they're damn good at what they do.  Just like The Who's MEATY, BEATY, BIG, & BOUNCY, everyone of these tracks shows an excellent band producing high quality singles which ranks as the best music from that time.  The thing that sets PURPLE apart artistically, with its commercial sound, is it sounds genuine and a natural evolution of the band, and never once feels manufactured at all (if you want manufactured grunge-by-numbers rock get SIXTEEN STONE by Bush).  PURPLE sounds both legitimate artistically and exhilarting musically, making it one of the most exciting records of the early 1990s.  <br />Buy Purple now, as it stands as one of the essential records from the 1990s.  Stone Temple Pilot never topped it, but resting on the strength of this and their other singles they will be sure to be remembered.  <br />Mike London<br />*Well, not all the songs sound like a hit grunge single.  The last track, 12 Gracious Melodies, is a hilarious novelty track.  I wish they had put \\"Tripping on a Hole in a Paper Heart\\" on here.  It so fits the sound on Purple, enough so that I almost think it's an outtake from this record..  That and \\"Dancing Days\\" too.  I knew that song from STP and didn't know it was a Zeppelin track until much later, so I always think of the STP version of it.  Shocked me when I learned it was Zeppelin because I was so used to STP singing it, and to tell the truth I think STP does a better job.

B000069I5W|2.0|After cop Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) becomes a local celebrity, he catches the eye of TV producer Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) who wants him to star in a new COPS style reality show. De Niro is unimpressed but fellow cop and aspiring actor Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy) sees this as his big chance at fame. The first half of the movie is a chore to get through, but thankfully it improves a little. It doesn't help that SHOWTIME has a pedestrian, badly paced script with few thrills or laughs. The three leads try to give it a boost, but its almost all for naught. The movie almost drowns in its mediocrity. There are more thrills in a half hour episode of COPs than SHOWTIME and De Niro isn't given the opportunity to display the comic flair he showed in ANALYZE THIS and MEET THE PARENTS. Murphy on the other hand doesn't evoke fond memories of Axel Foley (Bev Hills Cop#1), and Russo would be better off in another LETHAL WEAPON (not that she had much to do in #4). Oh well, at least there's no threat of a sequel.... I hope.
B00006J3T4|1.0|This is the worst I've ever heard from MK. As a fan since 1980 I have to ask is he turning out this garbage just to make a cheap buck? Sailing to Philadelphia was above average, this CD I threw in the trash bin. Give me more of that Dire Straits sound. I hope this is not the end of MK. While his concerts are stunning, he needs to get back to that familiar sound which made him famous and not dissappoint die hard fans. What horrible work. What was he thinking. All of you giving him 4 or 5 stars must be smoking funny cigarettes.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|This was a good film, but not the great film its been portayed as.  The best scene is Jenifer Connley's sexual frustration outburst.  While I love Jennifer Connley she seems mis-cast for this part, she seems out of place and not believable in parts of the film, she is just too hot.  Russle Crowe was good but neither him or her deserved Oscars consideration for these performances.<br />Don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but it doesn't rise to the level of \\"great\\" others seem to think ...
0395925037|5.0|This work is something of a phenonemon is that no other published work has been judged so predominantly on it's author alone without regard for it value as a literary piece. Had Plato, or Dickens or Shakespeare written this it would have had praise lavished upon it, just as if Hitler had written \\"Hamlet\\" it would have been condemned. To fully appreciate this work that narrow, blinkered political dogma has to be set aside. Approach with an open mind and evalutate the work itself and you will find that this book is not at all as it is commonly portrayed. It is reasonably well written, although it's foremost asset is the committment and passion with which the autor addresses the issues closest to his heart and the emotions of a man driven by burning ambition which radiate from every page. Whether or not you agree with the sentiment, I suspect most will not, every point is made with conviction and feeling. These are the words of a man speaking his mind with forthright honesty, a man who has a confident, unshakeable faith in his ideas and is not ashamed to share them with the world, a man with a vision in which he passionately believes. This book is branded \\"evil\\" as a matter of routine, but it is still essential reading if any objectively complete understanding of this period of history is to be achieved. No man should condemn that which he does not know, the other side of the story must be heard, and can there be a better source that the central figure in the story himself. Read this and dismiss it as nonsense if you see fit, but do read it for the insight it provides is as illuminating as it is invaluable.
B0000640VO|5.0|Simply a charming great film. Audrey Tautou is perfect and she is the best thing to come out of Europe in a long time.
0393317552|4.0|In this treatise Jared Diamond tackles no lesser a question than how Eurasian civilizations outstripped the rest of the world in technological development, allowing them to achieve preeminence on the world stage.  Everyone knows that the West employed guns, germs, and steel to annex the Americas, Africa, and the Far East, but this book tries to explain why these advantages arose in Eurasia first.  Diamond traces each of these advantages to one common source: the origins of agriculture first in Mesopotamia and China, not in Mexico or the Sahara or Australia.  He attributes Eurasia's head start to more easily domesticated flora and fauna, a lengthy east-west access allowing the rapid diffusion of civilization, and the absence of significant geological barriers to stop this spread.<br />Needless to say, this two sentence summary doesn't do justice to Diamond's argument.  His conclusions have the ring of truth, such as his assertion that the success of Western civilization has nothing to do with race and everything to do with an environment conducive to the growth of civilization.  However, Diamond's authoritative tone throughout the book belies the ultimately circumstantial nature of his evidence.  In addition, he made his essay less formidable at the cost of omitting entirely citations and footnotes documenting the evidence he does present.  The only references he offers are in his appendix of suggested readings for each chapter.<br />Better late than never, in the epilogue Diamond instills confidence in his rigor as a scientist by discussing the difficulties with his methodology.  At the same time, he credibly argues for the applicability of science to history.  The epilogue also briefly treats an important topic for Diamond's theory: why China failed to maintain the technological superiority it held over Europe until at least the sixteenth century.<br />This review has been mostly critical, but only because this book is essential reading for anyone attempting to understand human history at this scale.  Diamond's characterization of history cannot be proved correct by science, but we can ill afford to ignore it.  This seminal work provides a coherent explanation for perhaps the broadest and most important trend in human history, and for that Diamond deserves credit and merits your attention.
B00004YYDI|5.0|If your going to buy Leon/the Professional you should get the Uncut international version, it is better.  I can see why so much was cut from the domestic US release.  It was cut to fit into the action movie category and so they wouldn't have to worry about all the overly sensetive prudes in America.  Granted it is a great action movie, but thats just the background through which the stories focus occurs, which is the relationship and sexual tension between Leon and Matilda(a very young girl) played by Portman(the best acting she's ever done).  <br />There have been enough reviews on this, I'll cut to the simplified chase.  Combine Nabokov's Lolita (their relationship)and the Terminator (for action), sounds like a great flick to me, and it was.  This version restores the movie, the previous versions are watered down for the American Audience.
B00001MXXH|5.0|This is one of the best comedies ever mad and it is the best of John Hughes. It is about a boy named Ferris Bueller(Matthew Broderick) who pretends to be sick one school morning. His parents let him stay home and his sister Jeanie(Jennifer Grey) becomes really ticked at him. Later, Ferris calls his best friend Cameron Frye(Alan Ruck) to come over. Then Cameron calls in a disguised voice to the pricipal Ed Rooney(Jeffery Jones) to get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson(Mia Sara) out of school. When Rooney lets her out, the group goes to downtown Chicago. They go into the Sears Tower, an expensive restraunt, an art mueseum and much more! Meanwhile, Rooney is suspisious and snoops around the Bueller house. When it comes by 6:00, Ferris has to get home before Jeanie and the parent's do. If you have not seen this movie, I highly reccomend it.
B000002B2X|4.0|Although Sap has \\"4\\" songs on it, (i put quotes around four beacause there is a bonus song \\"love song\\"), its one of the best cds i've ever heard.<br />My only problem with Sap is the fact that the production isnt that good. The instruments could be turned up just a tad. But oh well. <br />Sap has 2 of my all time favorite Alice Songs<br />Brother: Arguably Alice's best song. I LOVE THIS SONG. I would recommend anyone buy this cd just for this song. The only thing better than this version is the unplugged version (where jerry's vocal skills are nigh perfect). <br />Got me Wrong: Not one of my favorite Alice songs, but it will grow on you. Especially what jerry does with the guitars during the chorus. <br />Right turn: Another of my Favorite Alice songs. It features Mark Arm of Mudhoney and the Chris Cornell of the Mighty Soundgarden. Wow. I love this song. Whats not to love about Cornell, Arm, Jerry and Layne all singing? <br />Am I Inside: the darkest song on the album. Probably cuz layne wrote it. But whatever the reason, i dont like the guitars in this one, so its an okay selection. Listenable, but just as easily skipped. <br />Thats it for the official songs. If this were just Brother, Got me Wrong, and Right turn, i would give Sap 5 stars withouth hesitation, but Am i Inside is included. So deduction of one star.<br />If you dont have it already, you should purchase Jar of Flies along w/Sap. Its even better than Sap.
0451191153|5.0|I read this book along with Atlas Shrugged and found them both to be some of the most powerful reading I had ever experienced.  Ms. Rand was a phenominal story-teller providing so many interesting characters overcoming impossible odds to show that individuality is preferrable to collectivism.<br />This book uses architecture as the basis.  Anyone deviating from the accepted architectural styles is scorned even if their buildings will be environmentally smart and economical.<br />Even if one doesn't care for the politics there is so much fascinating detail on how all the beautiful old buildings in New York City were designed.

B000002P2W|4.0|After releasing a series of albums intended for teenagers, The Who finally made an album worthy of their age.  Most of the songs on this album are honest and straight from the heart, and one can tell they are not trying to sell records.  The two live tracks included at the end are incredible; 'Dreaming From the Waist' has one of the most intense beginnings I've heard to any song.  This is The Who for who they really are, not what they are famous for.  Its good to hear a band play honest songs rather than silly songs about pinball wizards, teenage wastelands, and a guy with 4 personalities.
B00000I8NC|4.0|Driving cross a desert at night, with the silhouettes of a thousand burnt out mechanical corpses decaying to dust lurching in the red burning shadows, in a car that only wants to break down, or suffocate you with noxious fumes. The moon won't shine, and the stars are all dead, and something is after you in all its faceless horror. But you are consumed by nameless grief, and resignation to the inevitable bad ending of a pointless life. That's how this album feels. It's almost ugly, especially when Billy bada$$ starts ranting and raving. This Canadian group has a real talent for finding insane Americans, and then recording them. <br />   It's pretty disarming stuff, being both minimalist, and haunting, building to a crescendo, exploding, then limping off like some hated beast. There really is nothing in my experience (or collection) to compare it to, other than the 2 other GYBE albums I've managed to find in obscure record shops. It's easier just to buy it here. It's not the best album to show to your friends though, if they listen to different music than you, because they really won't appreciate how incredible this album is. My explanation is at best, poor.
0790737442|2.0|LETHAL WEAPON 2 is Director and Co-Producer Richard Donner's worst movie--until Joe Pesci saves the day!!!  Richard Donner has had an amazing career, with lots of successful movies that made a lot money and are pretty good art, too, like SUPERMAN:THE MOVIE, and THE OMEN, and his first LETHAL WEAPON movie was the proverbial tough act to follow, but LETHAL WEAPON 2 is awful until Joe Pesci steals the show!  I don't know what Joe Pesci's got in LETHAL WEAPON 2--he doesn't have it in LETHAL WEAPON 4--but in this movie he's funny, he's clever, and he's a likable third wheel for Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as they return to their roles as policemen Riggs and Murtaugh, with Pesci as a federal witness for them to protect, and you can guess where things go from there!<br />This time the villains aren't mercenaries, they're South Africans making counterfeit money, and one of the film's best lines is when Pesci brings Glover into the South African Embassy where an Afrikaner informs him, \\"But...but...you're black!!!\\"<br />But when Pesci's not in the scenes, there's just none of the fire of the first movie, and instead of the nonstop action of LETHAL WEAPON we're left with scenes like Gibson spending quality time at the Murtaugh's house chopping vegetables and nonchalantly talking about the death of his wife, a major part of his character in the first movie.

B00006F7S4|5.0|My god, I had to look at the CD again to make sure this was Beck. And so it was, but you could hardly tell! Everyone knew Beck was `talented', but I never guessed that he was REALLY talented. I don't think that's an exaggeration, because I'm really floored by this latest offering. It wasn't even close to what I had expected, and how often does that usually disappoint? I bought this blind, purely off of name, because at worst, Beck albums are at least very interesting.<br />  Someone before asserted that while this album was good, it was nothing remarkable. I beg to differ, because in the context of what is being offered these days by the music industry, this album is bloody great. You won't find a single fast track on here. No, not one. Sea Change feels more like a slow warm day on a sail boat, with a breeze in your hair. I am guessing that feels good. Anyone whose musical tastes haven't evolved beyond `I'm a {person}' might want to steer clear of this album, and head back to the ... Surfers section, because Beck has grown old and wise. I reiterate, WOW.
630469797X|5.0|Dawn of the Dead, the second fragment of the Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead trilogy, offers up a glimpse of the flesh-devouring world of the walking dead through the eyes of not one, but two of horrors premiere architects. Here, the meshing of Romero/Argento mindset commences, birthing something that taps both the veins of humor and horror in the same breath. Although it isn't a harbinger of horror that the third installment is, there are some mutilations toward the end that are commendable, plus a few bites here and there and a drove of headshots that keep the stage smeared with blood.<br />To Note: Depending on which version of the movie you obtain, you either have a more purely based horror movie on your hands with music befitting that theme (U.S. theatrical version), or you have a more complete picture with thirteen minutes of additional footage and an odd variety of quickly cut music that, for some reason, appeals to heavily to me (Director's Cut). This is all a matter of opinion, however, because Dawn of the Dead is unlike many movies that come with a director's cut edition. Both are lovely in their own rights and both are different creations, so you might want to judge this for yourself.<br />The movie begins shortly after Night of the Living Dead, with the land of opportunity running thick with speculation as to what is motivating sudden rash of \\"cannibal killings.\\" People debate the rhymes, reasons, and even the perpetrators of these ghastly events as the names of outdated rescue station blaze across the airwaves, sending people to their prospective dooms in the name of ratings. All the while people are huddled together in apartment buildings for their protection, forced from private residences because of their vulnerability, and teams of both army and localized militia hunt the horrors that seem intent on stalking the living.<br />  Amidst this chaos, some find themselves both fearful of the order being installed and the way the hammer of justice pounds away freely. Accordingly, they decide to become criminals themselves and flee, thinking they can find their own way in this chaotically shifting world. Enter our four main characters, two armed with some impressive small arms and skilled in the use of deadly force, one that's able to fly a helicopter he's commandeered from the local news station but is lacking in the way of the gun, and a seemingly predictable female that isn't as helpless as the movie first makes her out to be.<br />Their plan: to take the helicopter, land it outside the outstretched hands of law enforcement wherever there happens to be gas, to keep to the skies, and fly to Canada.<br />Their problems: they only have one pilot, little in the way of refueling stations, no real plan of action, a world full of zombie and human enemies, and no place to rest their weary heads.<br />Their salvation: A shopping mall of epic proportions, complete with a helipad and a fully stocked cupboard of guns, ammunition, food, and anything else the consumer bent on escapism desires.<br />The Complication: The mall is awash with the walking dead, all drawn here for some unknown reason that calls them back from beyond, with more waiting outside to fill its two-story coffers whenever something tasty becomes available.<br />Besides being a piece rich with characterization and understandable dilemmas, Dawn of the Dead also takes many a satirical poke at the valleys of consumerism and the mindsets of acquisition. By showing you the length to which some people would go to hold onto the shiny baubles they've hoarded and the effect it has even on the shambling Hare Krishna, I feel it effectively takes a few jabs without overwhelming perusing it, having fun while lightly coating it with a point. This makes it well worth watching, a nice second helping depicting a world huddling before its living dead masters.way the hammer of justice pounds away freely.

B00005T30L|2.0|Hardly hilarious movie attempting to be angst-ridden ironic social satire.  Steve Buscemi turned in a good performance in an unusual character for him, but all others were quite bland.  The main character was nothing but a self-absorbed teenage loser, bulldozing through other peoples lives, blissfully scornful of the damage she was doing.  If you liked Clerks, and many did, you'll probably like this, but, if you, like me, found that movie also to be boring and self-involved, then you won't like this one much either.  ...
B0000026T4|3.0|I'm an Alice Cooper fanatic, and it breaks my heart to say anything bad about his work, but this one just doesn't cut it. Alice could always bring his charm to what ever album he did in any given time period, but on Trash he is totally out of character. Unless that's the joke; The Alice Cooper character impersonating an 80s-Bon Jovi like-rock star. However, this is the album that gets the least attention from the cd player(even Zipper Catches Skin gets more!). However, there really isn't anything \\"Alice Cooper\\"-ish about this album to me outside his voice. It really hurts me to say this, but this album has probably the worst power ballad I have ever heard in my life(Only My Heart Talking). And this was his highest selling album! Go figure! That's the American public for ya. So, whenever I tell people I like Alice Cooper, I always get, \\"Oh, he sings 'Poison', I love that song!\\" Yes, that certainly is a good song, but I hate the fact that it seems like that's the song he's gonna be remembered by. All in all, I don't consider this album to be really bad by any means, I think it blows the doors off of most of the 80s pop bands of the day.  I just wish Alice would have chosen a different route is all.
0790736233|5.0|This movie has it all.  I read the book first, and usually that means I won't like the movie.  Of course this was a total surprise.  Sagan's work transferred very well onscreen, with only a few minor differences.  Foster is always excellent to watch, and what a great chemistry she shares with Matthew McConaughey!  If you haven't seen Contact or read the book, please try it out.  You'll go for a heckuva ride from one side of the Universe to the other, and discover that the human heart holds the greatest journey all the while :)
B00006GFAB|3.0|An Open Letter To The Band,<BR>     The next sound you hear is the bottom of the barrel being scraped as your legacy is once again remixed, remastered, repackaged, rereleased and, perhaps more appropriately, REGURGITATED like a cheap bottle of sangria down the front of the prom queen's dress.  While the track selection is acceptable on this latest attempt to prove the theory that he who dies with the most money wins, the question that begs to be asked is what real fan of the band hasn't bought these songs ten times over by now?  I've been there from the beginning - all of us here in Detroit have.  You once wrote a song about us and man were we ever proud!  We've flown the Kiss flag high here for almost 30 years, but now it's time to lower it to half mast.  Let's face it - you guys had a great run, but once Ace and Peter left, it was no longer Kiss but rather Gene and Paul and Employees.  If, as you insist on \\"Unplugged\\" (regrettably, I own it), Ace and Peter are \\"members of the family,\\" why are they treated like red-headed stepsons?  Last time I checked, drunk, stoned, and irresponsible was part of the job description.  But I digress...  It's time to move on, maybe try something different.  Gene, with your business and marketing acumen, you'd be a success at whatever you set your mind to.  Paul, maybe it's time to devote all of your energy to your burgeoning acting career.  Ace and Peter, you've both been so influential to so many young bands currently treading the boards that there has to be an opportunity to earn a decent living out there somewhere.  Whatever you do, unless it includes all four original members of the band, don't call it \\"Kiss.\\"  The release of this compendium reeks suspiciously like you guys are padding your coffers for retirement.  I have news - I called your brokers and your portfolios are doing well.  If you insist on plundering the vaults, there has to be a ton of pre-\\"Music From The Elder\\" demos, rehearsal tapes, and unreleased stuff collecting dust somewhere.  I'd rather have a set of Wicked Lester demos than purchase another hits package.  At first blush, the box set was a good idea, but it started lagging about mid-way through Disc 3.  And while embracing hucksterism is commendable in certain situations, leave things like Kiss coffins and $300 band history books to the P.T. Barnums and Ron Popeils of the world.  In closing, I'd just like to say that the late, drug-addled Johnny Thunders was wrong - you really can put your arms around a memory - it's cheaper and doesn't smell as bad.<br />Respectfully,<br />Clark from Detroit
0553579908|5.0|George R. R. Martin builds well rounded characters.  He keeps the reader on the edge with his many twists and turns.  All three books were real page-turners.  His style of following several characters is made easy with each chapter focussing on one main character's events.  I and my teenage son can't wait for the forth book to come out in April 2003.
B00004W52U|4.0|Well i listened to this after finding out Tim and Matt from Rancid were in this ska/punk/even a slight hint of hardcore, late 80's band. Not really knowing what to expect since I had previously only known the song &quot;sound system&quot;, I was pleasantly suprised. It turns out I've heard several other of these songs not knowing it was Operation Ivy. What I really enjoyed about this cd was its raw energy. Its not the best sound quality or polished by any means, but thats what is great about it. The drums and bass are loud and crashing, the vocals are a little scratchy and very loud, but again these are just more elements that helped me really get into this recording. I'd also like to point out I really don't like the ska punk music genre heard today, theres just something about it that for the most part isn't appealing. But this is the ska sound at its best. catchy, fast, and very appealing. I rated this at a 4, because I still can't see putting it up there with the Misfits, Ramones, etc, so I'd call the rating more of a 4.5-4.7 range. So in other words, pick this cd up. 27 songs, all filled with speed, energy, and an overall enjoyable sound.<BR>Oh yeah before i go, heres some stand out tracks in my opinion.<BR>&quot;Knowledge&quot; &quot;Sound System&quot; &quot;Take Warning&quot; &quot;Bombshell&quot; &quot;Gonna find you&quot; &quot;Room Without A Window&quot; &quot;Yellin In My Ear&quot;
0375414053|1.0|This woman has a partner, a nanny, and a well - paid job that gives her international travel (sans child) as a perk.  So - WHAT IS SHE WHINING ABOUT??? If you are a single mother like me, you'll find this book not only annoying, but insulting. This woman needs to get some perspective on how hard it really can be, to parent a child.
0385503954|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it is a classical novel, with a strong storyline, well-developed characters, fluid narration and sturdy plot. On the other hand, it does everything, especially in its last quarter, to shed all attributes of a regular novel and to transcend to the postmodern domain. Was it worth the effort?<br />In my opinion, no. Don't we all know that nothing in this world, at least from the ethical point of view, is certain? Don't we all know that memories often betray us? That a story, told by one person, may radically differ from the same story told by someone else? The twist of McEwan's novel is that there is, basically, just one person, one character, one creator of the whole world described there, whom we meet on the first pages as a 13-year-old girl. She's done something bad, almost unwittingly; she's bound to atone (what a strange word that is, back-formation from atonement, etymologically meaning &quot;being at one&quot; - presumably, with God and His eternal forgiveness) for her accidental crime as long as she breathes; what we get is the life story of this mission.<br />Briony the writer is trying to create a new and better universe. She is trying to undo the knot, to unfry the egg she had spilled on the pan by mistake. In the universe she is creating, she would be innocent, she would not be responsible for the demise of other people's lives. Is it possible to do so by writing?<br />Mildly postmodern in structure, &quot;Atonement&quot; is wildly traditional in its ethos. It does not matter in the least that instead of good causes, Briony is defending herself. It does not matter that her success is doubtful at best. It does not matter at all that by the end of the book, we get a glimpse of her brain shutting down. It does not matter that Briony herself is a fictional character. It is, at the end of the day, a novel attempting to change the world, even if this world is confined within a nutshell. This is a novel withan Idea. And a Cause.<br />This is not an evaluation, though. Literary merits of a book are, in the long run, independent of any ideas the author is trying to promote. (Unless they are patently stupid ideas, which indicates that the author is stupid, which in turn washes away, almost inevitably, any remaining traces of talent.) As a historical novel, &quot;Atonement&quot; succeeds. The 1935-country-manor scenes are especially vivid. But the reader is forced to read through several hundred pages - this is a rather long book indeed - without getting very much to think about in the end. Not very much new, anyway.
B00003CXI1|5.0|&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is the first installment to the Harry Potter film series, based on the wonderful novels by J.K. Rowling. In &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, we get introduced to Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), a young British boy of eleven who lives with his mean Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and spoiled cousin Dudley. The Dursleys try to be a perfectly normal family--they despise everything that seems out of the ordinary--but they also have a secret which Harry will soon learn. Harry is actually a wizard! He's just been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and this is where the adventure begins. Harry learns the truth about his past from the friendly Hogwarts Games Keeper named Hagrid, and during his first year at the magical school, Harry makes friends, arch rivals, and even mortal enemies as he starts his training in the magical arts. <br />For anyone who loves the books, you must see this film. The acting is outstanding by the entire cast...most of the actors fit right into their roles. The special effects are superb and engaging. The storyline follows the first book pretty well, though they had to take out some of the book. The film is just about how I imagined it would be as I read the book. Daniel Radcliffe is the perfect Harry Potter! The DVD is OK with seven deleted scenes, a self-guided tour of Hogwarts, interviews with the filmmakers, behind-the-scenes look at the making of &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot;, DVD-ROM extras, and more. The bad thing about the DVD extras is that, to get to the deleted scenes, you have to play a game every time and it gets a little annoying after a while. All in all, amazing film and I can't wait for the next one.<br />I highly recommend &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot;.<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
185984054X|5.0|Christian theology teaches that everyone is imperfect and tainted by Original Sin.  All human beings are tempted by the sin of pride and other vices.  Why should Mother Theresa be any different?  There are indeed serious questions that were never adequately answered regarding the large sums of money at her disposal.  Were they spent according to the wishes of the donors, or was much of it siphoned off to other endeavors that had little to do with assisting the hopelessly downtrodden?  Did these unfortunates truly receive the best medical care possible?  Is there any truth to the allegations that many of these patients were denied pain killers to supposedly prepare them spiritually for life everlasting? Why didn't Mother Theresa comprehend the cold fact that dictators and convicted criminals were giving her money stolen from other people?  Would trained certified public accountants have found many abuses and squandering of funds?  Alas, often even well meaning people unwittingly waste the resources under their direct responsibility.  A good heart alone is not enough when managing a large organization.<br />It is intellectual dishonest to ignore \\"The Missionary Position.\\"  Christopher Hitchens is an avowed atheist, but this shouldn't be held against him. The author's rhetoric is admittedly a bit too aggressive and borders on the abusive.  Nonetheless, Hitchens has presented some strong evidence that tarnishes the hagiographic memory of the often described Saint of Calcutta.  The man deserves a point by point careful rebuke and not argumentum ad hominem attacks. This relatively short book earns a place among all the other works on Mother Theresa....
B00005JKDR|5.0|Disney and Pixar studios have done it again! \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is a story about the monsters you were always afraid of after the lights went out. In the world of monsters, Monstropolis, James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) is at the top of the scare list at Monsters Incorporated, the business where monsters try to scare children around the world so the world of monsters, can keep their electricity. Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) is Sullivan's wise-cracking, one-eyed partner who dreams of becoming famous and winning over the woman of his dreams. Sullivan's arch rival is the slimy, sneaky Randell, who will do anything to be at the top of the scare list. When Randell tries to beat Sullivan's record, Sullivan finds out and he accidentally lets a little girl out of her room and into the monster world. The monsters think that if they get touched by a human child, then they will die. So after Sullivan breaks the news to Wazowski, it's up to them to try and get the little girl--who Sullivan names Boo--to get back into her room before anybody in the monster world finds out!<br />The computer animation is absolutely brilliant. The storyline is light and humerous and is not full of \\"dirty toilet jokes\\" like in the film, \\"Shrek\\". John Goodman and Billy Crsytal make the perfect animated pair! The DVD includes hours of extras, such as the hilarious animated short film, \\"Mike's New Car\\", and the Oscar-winning animated short film, \\"For The Birds\\". There are also hilarious outtakes, filmmaker's audio commentary, never-before-seen deleted scenes, behind the scenes, a tour of Pixar studios, and tons more! A must have to your family DVD library.<br />I highly recommend \\"Monsters, Inc.\\".<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+

0920668372|5.0|I loved the story. The predictable language is great for young children and the story is heart warming for adults. It presents the reader to the worse case scenarios of stages parents go through with their children and counter acts them with love.  It's a great message to send to our young children.  All too often parents do not express their love to their children as verbally as maybe they should.  This story shows in an exaggerated and even unrealistic way how a mother tells her son that she loves him.  Thus this book is a great introduction to the word \\"I love you\\" towards our children if it is not a word being used at home.  After reading this book parents can talk to their children about not being sneaky about saying \\"I love you\\" and that despite the mistakes they do we will always love them.
630280082X|5.0|I have not seen crossroads yet as it is not an easy film to get a hold of, but going by reviews from other people i know it will be my favourite film ever ( apart from the matrix).  I play the guitar, and i taught myself to play eugenes trick bag in around a week, as someone told me i wouldnt be able to play it, so all you virtuosos out there have patience learn to play it and practice practice practice, and then go and stun your friends.  In the meantime i am going to try and obtain a copy of this awesome film.

B00006JDVV|4.0|This film has that classic post-apocalyptic look - very dark, burnt-out, broken battlements, etc. It's a nice mix of fantasy and military SF. Christian Bale is fabulous - you feel a lot of sympathy for his character, but you are also frustrated by his (at first) lack of action to change his situation. This is where the charismatic and fun McConaughey character comes in. Matt's unrecognizable from those wussy love interests he's playing in the past - and that's a good thing. He and Christian Bale make perfect eye-candy, especially in those shirtless combat scenes which is a welcome change for me, as a female, from sitting through action movies where girls always get naked.<BR>The dragons look great, and yeah there are some big plot holes - but I wasn't expecting Shakespeare. This movie was fun to watch, fast-paced and just plain great entertainment.
B00005QG9J|5.0|After the massive success of 'Make Yourself' Incubus had a lot to live up to on their next release.  Not only did they have the difficult task of bettering their previous album but they also had to pay for their success.  Critics began to bash the band saying they sold out and that their music was all the same.  However 'Morning View proved to be just as good if not better than 'Make Yourself' in my opinion.  The band proves to be maturing musically.<br />'Morning View' is a departure from the commercialism of 'Make Yourself' to a more laidback easy going trippy feel.  <BR>NICE TO KNOW YOU is a wonderful rockin' opener.  CIRCLES is another great rock song.  WISH YOU WERE HERE is a catchy great single.  JUST A PHASE is an eerie acoustic/electric experience with a zoned out feel.  11 AM is another great tune that could be a single.  BLOOD ON THE GROUND is a great hard rock tune.  MEXICO is a beautiful acousitc ballad.  WARNING is another great radio hit.  ECHO is a beautiful ballad with wonderful lyrics.  HAVE YOU EVER is another hard rocking tune with an awesome bass line.  ARE YOU IN? is a breathtaking trippy psychadelic experience with a catchy beat.  UNDER MY UMBRELLA is another hard rock tune with a great riff.  The album closer here AQUEOUS TRANSMISSION is a wonderful experimentation of rock and Eastern Asian music.  Truly a wonderful piece of music. <br />Overall 'Morning View' shouldn't be over looked.  It is my personal favourite Incubus album.  Although I love their other work too!  But this one has such a wonderful feel to it.  It has a real positive vibe about love and life something we don't hear in music too much these days.  Highly recommended!

6305137293|4.0|This is no where near as good as the 1st one. This one kind of ripped of Jason. Jason is a possed fat dude with a hideous face (probably his father) and can't be killed because Jason and his mom want revenge! In Halloween II, Michael Myers seemed alot like that. Kind of a smack in the face after the amazing original. Basically if any film has a seuel, or is going to be re-made, it'll [be bad]! Unfortunately Hollywood never learns, and now they are doing the unthinkable, REMAKING THE SCARIEST SLASHER OF ALL TIME!!THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE! Why won't they learn! If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm saying this, because I heard rumors about a Halloween re-make, and I hope and pray to God that it isn't true! Hollywood you [are bad]! See the first Halloween, and the first one only!
B00000331V|5.0|Before there was &quot;Centerfold&quot; and MTV, there was a band from the East Coast that would have given James Brown a run for his money.  I was always told that in concert was the only way to experience J.Geils, and this CD totally proves it.  From the opening with Peter Wolf screamin &quot;Gimme the key&quot;, until the &quot;Stay&quot;-era Bowieish funk stomp closing of &quot;Give It To Me&quot;, these guys are on FIRE!  This band was a force to be reckoned with.  This is good-time party music that was probably at home in every frat house in the 70s, and still sounds great today.  Just check out the last song, &quot;Give It To Me&quot;, and see if I'm wrong.  Organ grinder Seth Justman shines brightly on this set. You won't be disappointed if you like high-energy R&amp;B.
0140177396|5.0|It stuns me that people don't like this book (from what I've read in the reviews)!<br />This is a GREAT book. It tells of two men trying to live a dream, and while the rest of the world is travelling alone and trying to make money, these two are holding on to each other and their friendship. It's a great book - period! This is Steinbeck's only good book from what I've read of his collection.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The rest of the reviews say it all.  You will either love this film, or hate it.  One thing all must admit, this film is the most daring and unique film that has come out of the studios in many, many years.<BR>  To those of you who thought the ending tragic, or if you are viewing the film for the first time, you should watch through the end credits.  The story is barely told through the dialogue.  It is told through emotion and music.  And the music does not stop until the end.  If you follow along with the rest of the Orpheun myth that is Moulin Rouge, it ends with the happiest of endings.  It gives comfort to those who find their true love and then must say goodbye far too soon.<BR>  If you accept the contract and go for the ride, and if you believe in love, then you'll easily see why this film rises head and shoulders above the rest.
B00006JIA4|4.0|If you're new to Queen and you're planning on getting the Platinum collection, then I can tell you for sure that you won't be dissapointed... however, it would be a better choice to get the old \\"Greatest Hits I & II\\" box set with \\"Made In Heaven\\" added. <BR>Why??... because \\"Greatest Hits I & II\\" has the best of Queen from 1974-1991, and the only album that Queen put out after Freddie Mercury's death in 1991 was 'Made In Heaven' <BR><BR>Greatest Hits 3 has the hit tracks from Made In Heaven, plus some good hits that weren't before included (These Are The Days, No One But You, Princes Of The Universe, Thank God It's X-mas). <BR>The bad thing is that Greatest Hits 3 has a bunch of refills that should have never been included... \\"Under Pressure (Mix)\\", \\"The Show Must Go On\\" (w/ Elton John) and a horrible version of \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" by Wyclef Jean that ruins this album just as much as Jar Jar Binks ruined Star Wars: Episode I. <BR><BR>What is even more annoying about Greatest Hits 3 is the fact that they left out REAL QUEEN HITS, like... Tie Your Mother Down, Scandal, and Love Of My Life and they had to include a bunch of tracks that aren't even QUEEN songs. <BR><BR>You wouldn't regret buying 'The Platinum Collection' but I can almost guarantee that when you listen the 3rd CD, you'd want to skip tracks 1,2, and especially 14!!.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|I must admit, I've never read the books that the film was based off of. I went to the theater not knowing what to expect; and I saw it twice more, and bought the DVD when it first came out. It's that good.<br />Part of the reason I find Shrek so wonderful, is that this is a hero that we can all relate to. So maybe our table manners are a bit better, but we can all relate to some of the emotions that are expressed. Underneath the ogre is a prince with a very tender heart. And perhaps another reason, without giving too much away, is that this movie shows that you don't have to look beautiful to be beautiful. The sly jabs to Disney and other pillars of children's entertainment kept both my children and myself laughing, and a sense of justice is held.<br />The Special edition DVD has several features that are fun, but it's the movie itself that will be repeated, over and over.
B000002UAX|5.0|As most of you know, since the unity of the band was declining, this turned out to be a 3 and 1/2 circuit solo album. Ringo temporarily left the Beatles in the middle of the sessions (Paul took his place on drums on \\"Back in the USSR\\" and \\"Dear Prudence\\"). He explained the situation to both John and Paul, \\"You 3 seem so close and I feel out of it.\\" Since they too felt out of it, they replied \\"I thought it was you 3, Ringo!\\" Needless to say, Ringo came back and the 4 finished the White Album (though often, all 4 Beatles were still not present on each song).<br />That said, I'll review each Beatles' efforts starting with John's (today would've been his 62nd birthday). Many of his songs have to deal with the Beatles' trip to India. \\"Prudence\\" is about Mia Farrow's reclusive sister. \\"I'm So Tired\\" and \\"Yer Blues\\" (John's most rocking track) deal with some of the difficulties John experienced there. \\"Me and My Monkey\\" recollects much of the Maharishi's philosophy and \\"Sexy Sadie\\" deals with John's final disappointment, confronting him about... \\"If you're so cosmic, you'll understand!\\" John pokes fun at those who take the Beatles' myth too seriously on \\"Glass Onion\\", can't make up his mind for or against destruction on \\"Revolution 1\\" (different from the single with \\"shoobedoowhop\\" harmonies), questions violence in the tounge-in-cheek singalong \\"Bungalow Bill\\" (with a solo from Yoko, only one line, thankfully!), more wry humour on the folky \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" (with Paul cryptically closing the song singing \\"Take me back\\"), proclaims his love for Yoko on the 1950's style \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun.\\" If you can endure 8 minutes of sound effects on \\"Revolution 9,\\" you're a true Beatles fan (though interesting, Yoko's audible suggestion at the end spooks me a bit!). Last but not least, John pays homage to his late mother on the beautiful \\"Julia.\\"<br />Paul chooses a variety of musical styles: Beach Boy harmonies on \\"USSR\\" (with the sound of jets flying throughout the song), reggae on \\"Ob-La-Di...\\", classical on \\"Martha My Dear.\\" heavy metal on \\"Helter Skelter\\" (the take used lasted nearly 30 minutes, with Ringo screaming \\"I've got blisters on my fingers!\\"), good old rock and roll on \\"Birthday,\\" honkeytonk on \\"...Do It in the Road,\\" and 1920's vaudeville on \\"Honey Pie,\\" with a great solo by John. Fortunately, \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" is under a minute. He uses folk style on \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" the tongue-in-cheek \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", \\"Blackbird\\" (with bird chirping), \\"I Will\\" (Ringo's percussion sounds like a horse and carriage).<br />George was improving as a writer here and it shows, even though he was only allowed 4 songs. He brings in Eric Clapton on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" (allegedly about Paul's \\"Don't play it that way\\" attitude), satirizes the social class on \\"Piggies\\" (with strings and a harpsicord), jokingly warns Clapton not to eat too many sweets on \\"Savoy Truffle\\" (the saxes are a nice touch!) and seeks his Maker on the mystical \\"Long, Long, Long\\" (one note on the organ caused a bottle atop to vibrate at the coda).<br />Ringo writes his 1st song- the country and western \\"Don't Pass Me By.\\" John's lush lullaby to Julian is given to Ringo to sing, closing the album peacefully.<br />That's a lot of music to review, but Paul's defense to those who complained about it was \\"Whaddya mean? It's great, it sold, it's the bloody Beatles' white album- shut up!\\" Enough said.
6303347657|5.0|This is true out-and-out Carrey. It shows something that isn't really new, that Jim turns into crazy but funny maniac at night (just at night?)...It's basically about a [guy] who finds a mask that turns him into a lunatic with superpowers. (Example: Ipkis twists a balloon into a machine gun.) It's rated PG13 for some infrequent violence. <BR>Great fun. Go buy it now or else . . . You won't have fun on a rainy day...

B00004RYZT|5.0|A great dvd with the German metal masters doing what they do best, put on a great show.  the only downside to this dvd is that Bck Dich wasn't included.  just keep in mind whenever you watch or listen to rammstein that they are rarely 100% serious.  take what you see with a grain of salt, and this is a great concert dvd full of great music, fire, and features.

B00005LC1H|5.0|I loved the series on PBS. If you enjoyed John Cleese in \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\", or \\"The Life of Brian\\", This is a must have. This set includes interviews with All the cast. It's worthwhile watching, both the series, and the interviews.<br />John Cleese outdoes himself as Basil Fawlty. The only drawbacks I can think of are A. The series was so short (12 episodes), and B. I had to stop the DVD frequently to groan on Basil's behalf.<br />Silly. Absurd. Slapstick. Fun!!<br />DC
0743455967|5.0|Before I finished this book I dreamt that I was sitting next to King's desk and he was slouching back in his chair discussing his thoughts on writing and tips on how to get a story out of my head and into a novel. That is what this book is to me.<br />King speaks of the disipline, techniques, and how to bring the story out from your mind. It does not give character charts, forms and other things that have bogged me down in the past. It's skill and talent. One you can hone, the other you must already possess.<br />Within days of finishing this book, I had enough to write a synopsis and start the nitty gritty of the first draft. When I get my first book published, King is getting a mention for all of his help.<br />A must read - regardless of your genre.

B00004TR2G|5.0|Dun, dun, dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun.<br /><br />Aaaaahh: Jaws,<br />What a fond memory I have of this music. And the movie. Imagine a small boy of about eight or nine - scared to death of \\"gritty\\" movies - watching Steven Spielberg's \\"Jaws\\". You are reading the words of a kid who absolutely loved Indiana Jones and The Temple Of Doom, but ran away at the sequence where the poor soul's heart is ripped out. The first time I saw that part must have been at the age of fifteen. On the other hand, I could bear watching the big henchman being mashed on the stone crusher. Why? In retrospect, I believe I could because in this scene you actually see nothing at all. The only thing you see is a trail of blood. How gross the rest of it is depends solely on your imagination and the amount of it you wish to use up on it. That is the power of Jaws as well, of that I am convinced. The first time we really see the shark we are well into the second hour of the film. Quite a few people have died atrocious deaths before that time, but we never see more than a distant outline - a fin - or a set of jaws deep in troubled water.<br />In terms of moviemusic, the film presents us two themes: one for the hunters ON the water, and one for the hunter IN the water. Both have common mathematics, but that could just as well be imagination, discerning that the shark's theme is basically two repetitive notes, backed up with some flourishes and instrumental tints. This is the famous theme - the one you can listen to on your Walkman chasing old people down the street, a funny predatorily feeling coming over you (- and perhaps the old people are listening to the same theme, chasing young people - you never know).<br />The second theme is a wordless sailor's ditty for the three protagonists: slightly humorous, yet moreover the adventurous and sensitive element. Both pieces intertwine; evolve around each other throughout the album - strikingly here, contemplative there. In between and through this is bodiless atmospheric music: plucking harp, humming cellos and brass, and whirling violin. At some times, special moments arise, such as the playful introspective \\"Father And Son\\", and deep momentum \\"Between Attacks\\". The short piece called \\"Montage\\" was called \\"The Menu\\" on the original release - a short baroqueske work underscoring the arrival of the hordes of dull big-town tourists on the island. Not an action piece in terms of violence, but of preparation, \\"The Shark Cage Fugue\\" is foreboding and driving. A broke-down version of the heroes' theme.<br />This is an earlier John Williams score, and yet one of his best. Could one compare it with Star Wars or Raiders Of The Lost Ark? I think one would better compare with The Sugarland Express and The Cowboys. Despite all its minimalism and moody tones, it beats both excellent scores easily. The greater part of the soundtrack is swallowed up by shark-music, which is potentially boring. However, Williams plays around with them, so that one gets the same theme with the same purpose, but ever slightly different in construction, thus maintaining the interest of the listener.<br />My favourite part of the score? Undoubtedly the small part where Williams subtly phrases Quint's sailor song, to mark the captain's inner resolution. Quint blew up the Orca's engines, when he panicked and wanted to get the hell back to mainland. He has grown calmer now though, but it is too late. The Orca is irrevocably going under, the shark is waiting, following like a jackal. Brody's out of spirit and Hooper is not doing any better. Quint retreats into the cabin. The camera outside shows us Brody, frightened. Then Hooper, breathing hastily, sweat is on his face. Then into the ship, to captain Quint, with his back to us. He slowly turns to the camera and reveals his face. Jaw set, lower teeth showing, eyes distant yet determined. You can see he is scared to death but pushing it aside. Overruling it. What is he thinking? What is he deciding? What goeson inside old Ahab's mind?<br />Williams gives the answer, by playing the little seaman's ditty Quint sings several times throughout the film. The one he sings when he is in a good mood, or when he needs to recall them. The one he undoubtedly learned when he was in the Navy, at the end of the Second World War. When he was stationed on the Indianapolis, when it sank and delivered her crew to the tigersharks. `Farewell and a-do to you fair Spanish ladies, farewell and a-do to you ladies in Spain.' He descends into the flooding hold and retrieves lifejackets. Two. No more than two.<br />This scene does not appear on the original album release. Neither do \\"Father And Son\\" and many others. Did you like Jaws, and do you like film-music? This collector's edition is an absolute must-have. The music is remastered to crystal clarity, the booklet contains background info with pictures (including one of Spielberg being eaten by Jaws!) and well... and and and. Good buy all around, in short.<br />This one gets four stars for the music (remastering and new tracks inclusive), and one for the packaging.

0805062971|5.0|this book has given me so many wonderful things to try in my job as a waiter in a fine-dining beach club. but i'll take the 5th. it really is a shame that i had to see the film first to hear about this book. at least there are some differences, so better some equally as cool. thoughout the entire book we never learn the main character's name and that must have been a tireless endevour for Chuck. If you have seen the movie and loved it or even if you didn't like it, do you're self a favour and read this book, you'll be glad you did!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I was told how good this movie was by several people, which usually means the movie doesn't live up to the hype.  Oh Contraire monfraire.  This movie exceded my expectations.  Not only is Monsters, Inc. funny but it is warm and charming as well.  You fall in love with Sully almost instantly and your fondness of him grows throughout the movie.  Mike is a hoot, voiced perfectly by Billy Crystal.  Boo is amazing, how the makers of this movie make you care about a cartoon so much is amazing.  I can not say enough good things about this movie, I highly recomend this for people of all ages.
B00004R99J|4.0|What's up with all the grain on the picture? Even my VHS copy has clearer picture quality. This DVD must have been rushed because it's obvious Disney did not put in their best efforts on this film.<br />On the other side of things, this is one of the last Disney movies that held the style and class of other films such as &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty And The Beast.&quot; The songs are beautiful and timeless. The animation is spectacular. This is a wonderful movie, despite it's history is FAR from accurate. I'd give this DVD 5 stars if it wasn't for the inexcusable poor picture quality.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The first three Star Wars movies are legendary.  They are timeless classics that have a cult following.  That brings us to the fourth episode in the series Phantom Menace.  This was a very well done movie with a great story of how Anakin Skywalker and OB Won Kanobi first meet.  The special effects were wonderful, Even Jar Jar Binks.  I may be in the minority but I felt Jar Jar actually added to the movie.  Just as in all stories the beginning is the slowest, it is where characters need to be developed so the story is usually slow.  It is an important part of the story but the movie just doesn't reach that legendary level of the previous three.  On the DVD the extras are worth the purchase.  There is a sit down interview with George Lucas which is very rare since he does not do a lot of interviews and he gives you a behind the scenes look at how they made the movie.  I still recomend this for anyone who likes the Star Wars movies or is a sci-fi fan.
B000066AXC|4.0|Howard's latest movie, and winner of several awards, concerns the genius, home life and mental illness of John Nash (Crowe).  Taking us through his college years up to when he won the Nobel Prize, 'A Beautiful Mind' is an assured, open and often very moving film.  Crowe proves that his performances in 'Gladiator' and 'The Insider' weren't flukes, with a showy but bravely unsympathetic role.  Many decried that playing the madman was an easy option, which maybe would have been the case with any lesser actor, but anyone who watches Crowe in the early scenes, a bumbling, nervous, self-righteous college graduate can testify that this was certainly no easy option.  Indeed, shrugging off the action stereotype that might have come with his last role was surely no easy feat but Crowe makes you forget Maximus of Spain completely here.<br />Of course, that isn't wishing to forget the dazzling tour de force that is Jennifer Connelly.  Watching her act, the word 'actress of a generation' often springs to mind, and like Crowe she has proven her determination not to be typecast.  Her role here is as far removed from her performance as drug-addled Marion Crane in 'Requiem For A Dream' as it could possibly be.  A lesser performer may have been tempted to simply allow the script do the work (after all, she could basically have been a mere housewife) but it is in the reflection of Nash's madness in his wife's eyes that makes it so horrific.  You get the feeling that the occasionally unrealistic portrayal of schizofrenia have been made more romantic (there is only about one hospital scene) so as to ensure that the movie's rating was kept down.  However, through two magnificent performances the audience is allowed a real insight into not just how madness affects one person but the people around him.<br />Whilst Howard's earlier movies such as 'Apollo 13' were assured but ultimately formulaic, he really shows himself to be a very talented director indeed on this which is probably his best film to date.  Thankfully rather than wallowing in period detail he wisely chooses to take it slow, injecting a good deal of characterisation and a very honest and therefore moving portrayal of a relationship on the edge.  Even if this doesn't quite rank up there with 'Hilary And Jackie', it is still one of the best biopics of recent years and a milestone for all concerned.
1559408898|5.0|In the hands of virtually any other director, this movie would have been abysmal (as demonstrated by the awful sequels). Paul Verhoeven however, produced an unflinching view of an imagined future, with gallons of blood &amp; drenched in jet-black comedy. Don't let the name fool you, this is no kids movie, it's a total comic-book rollercoaster. This Criterion disc has a superb commentary track, but the oter extras are very much a '1 watch' thing. Picture isn't bad (but lacks anamorphic enhancement) &amp; the sound is only Dolby Surround, but the movie itself more than compensates. (A region 2 version is available in Europe as part of a Robocop 3-disc boxset with a new commentary track, 5.1 sound, 1:1.85 anamorphic picture, new &amp; old documentaries &amp; deleted scenes. Well worth importing if you can hanle R2 PAL discs)
B00003CX8Y|5.0|In a time when CGI movies are taking over the big screens, Disney has brought back the magic of the classic animated movie. Many hailed Beauty and the Beast as the revival of the Disney animation studio when it debuted in theatres some years ago. Similar as it did for the Disney franchise in the theatres, this Special Edition is doing the same for Disney DVD collection.<br />This long awaited release couldn't  have come at a better time. The DVD is packed with features that not only benefit the movie, but Disney in general as well. From the moment the DVD is ran on your DVD player, viewers are immediately brought back to their childhood days. The familiar Magic Kingdom wipes down in a fashion we have long become accustomed to. A commercial for Disney World was even snuck into Disc 2. While I am usually not a fan of commercials on DVDs, I found that this one in particular was appropriately included to remind us that Disney World is not just another tourist attraction, but a part of our generation.<br />But what makes this DVD so great? Is it the option of watching 3 different versions of the movie? Is it the bountiful option of games? It is actually a culmination of these. But the one thing that will mark this DVD as the milestone DVD of Disney movies to come is that it illustrates Disney in the past, present, and future on both discs.<br />On disc 1, viewers can watch the transformation of not only the Beast, but of the movie as well. Viewers can watch the movie in a pre-production format, the original theatrical release, and the featured Special Edition. On Disc 2, Disney goes down their familiar road of including previews for upcoming movies in addition to a wide selection of features for Beauty and the Beast. What will longed be remembered and viewed by owners of this DVD is the look back at past Disney classics such as Cinderella, the Lion King, and Pocahontas. The feature hosted by Celine Dion takes an in-depth look at the roots of Disney classics. This is a welcome treat by Disney to its customers that have been longing to own a look at history. <br />With the Lion King hitting IMAX theatres this winter, it is interesting to see where Disney will go with their DVD lineup. Indeed, this Special Edition will long be seen as a milestone in the Disney Home DVD lineup. It brings back the magic of classic animation unmatched by its CGI counterparts. A tale as old as time, so goes the magic of Disney and its classic animation movies.
B000059TPN|5.0|A superb popcorn action movie, directed with style &amp; flair by Bay (working with decent material for a change), The Rock is a perfect example or how action should be done. The excellent cast certainly helps, with Harris &amp; Connery standing out in particular. Picture quality is superb (&amp; widescreen enhanced) &amp; the DTS soundtrack will have your house shaking. Besides the commentary, the extras are very much take it or leave it, &amp; will probably only get 1 viewing.  Well worth buying for the movie though, as dumb action movies don't get much better. Sit back, switch off your brain for 2 hours, &amp; enjoy the ride.
0920668372|5.0|This book is great for people of all ages.  It's a great story for children and also a great gift.  Give it to a new reader or to your mom to show her how much you care.  It's also a great story to help show the importance of family and for loving people for who they are, not what they do. BUY IT, READ IT!
B000068IEU|3.0|Being as this movie is such an infamous cult classic, & being as i am from the UK (where it's been banned for 30 years), watching this movie was a little wierd, as i was expecting it to be a lot worse than it actually was (repugnant & disturbing are 2 words i've heard a lot in descriptions of this movie). In actuality, it's little more than a very amatuerly made horror/drama flick. Sure, some scenes are in bad taste, but it's more laughable than anything else, mainly due to some highly inappropriate music in the notorious killing/rape scenes, & the gore count is pretty low. Worth picking up for die-hard Craven fans' anyone else should try to watch it before buying, as it hasn't aged well. Good extras though, with the commentary & making-of's being well worth a look.

B0000025ZK|5.0|Every member of Pink Floyd has made attempts to do soloalbums after the original Pink Floyd was disbanded. Roger Waters is the most known, for his excellent work on Pros and Cons and Amused to Death. What people dont see, is the underrated David Gilmour`s work.<br />He first released his soloalbum called \\"David Gilmour\\", which were quite good. Then many years later he released this, \\"About Face\\", a cd that can be compared to even the work of Pink Floyd. IMO, it is even better and more interesting to listen to this now, as the songs here are interesting, unplayed and fresh. Still they keep a special style, always switching between PF and Gilmour solo. This is very noticable on \\"Near the End\\" which sounds like a song from the Wall, and maybe even from Pros and Cons. But not even those two are really comparable, they are just closer than other cd`s. <br />Let me say it, this cd is very,very good.<br />The best songs here is \\"Murder\\", \\"Love on the Air\\", \\"Out of the Blue\\", \\"Cruise\\", \\"Let`s get metaphysical\\" and of course, \\"Near the End\\". <br />The rest of the songs are okay, although not as good as the mentioned. <br />Many complain about Gilmour`s simple texts, however I think this is a wrong doing. Gilmour makes strong, meaningful texts about life, with ordinary words that makes it easy to understand. He doesnt write things like \\"Are you satisfied with the way her swimsuit sticks to her skin\\" texts like Roger Waters, but he keeps the songs to the subject. Simple as they may, but they hold a meaning in every song, and makes it more accessible for other listeners too.<br />The Melodies here are SO great! He uses a full band, his guitarplaying is topnotch although laid-back and it sounds relaxed, yet great. David Gilmour got a good voice, he never tries to raise the curtains just to make his voice go higher or better. He sings with a calm voice, and it all sounds even better than Roger Waters voice.<br />Near the end of this review, I will finish it off with a quick summary. For a more Melodic, less experimental Pink Floyd, turned into a rocker, this is the way to look. The sound is clean, fresh and interesting, the melodies are well written and the text do have a meaning. In short this cd is the best post Pink Floyd Album released up to date. <br />I cannot do anything else than highly recommend this to every fan of both Pink Floyd and David Gilmour.
B000003S0F|5.0|While the reviewers here seem to know what's up, Islands doesn't seem to get the recognition it deserves. <br />There's no doubt that Islands is mellow -- perhaps the most mellow album in King Crimson's body of work. However, it doesn't feel like muzak. It's more like Coldplay meeting Pink Floyd when both are feeling tired and would rather be drinking tea. <br />The real joy of this album is Song of the Gulls&gt;Islands, which is a very quiet, slow building climax to the album. It never opens up and rocks out like previous albums, but continually builds on itself. <br />It's just a very dark and sad-sounding album. Fortunately, it doesn't wear its emotions on its sleeve like nu-metal of the current day. One of my favorite albums to play on a rainy fall afternoon. <br />The only complaint I have with the album are the lyrics, which ge a little too precious at times. Still, it's a wonderfully moody CD and the title track is worth the price of admission alone. The supremely brassy cornet sounds great and gives a lot of emotion to the track.
6305313687|5.0|Just a very well written, acted, and shot movie.  It makes you cringe, think, and draws you in as few movies do.  Not to sound cliche, but this movie has all the qualities you'd hope for each time you sit down in front of the big screen.<br />Edward Norton is clearly one of the best actors going and this is just another rock solid performance.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Give me a break.  A previous reviewer comments: \\"This CD illustrates what's really ailing the music industry\\".  Hardly.  Beck could no doubt give you just what you expect.  This album will receive very little airplay because IT IS what the industry needs: Someone willing to create a consistent, well-constructed, well-engineered piece of art.  Not ... that is consumed in brief sound bites, like a USA Today article or Headline News clip.  In general, we are a society conditioned to sound bites.  If you are willing to invest your time in Beck's new work, it will pay you back with many hours of enjoyment as it gets under your skin and wakes you with lovely melodies dancing in your head...truly full of life and NOT gloomy.

B00003CXXI|5.0|My 4 year old and 18 month old love this movie - it is fun, has a GREAT message about not judging a book by it's cover and some wonderful music.  Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers do outstanding jobs with their characters.  There is some &quot;body function&quot; humor (e.g., passing gas and burping), but it is done in a funny way and my kids REALLY find those scenes funny.  There are a couple minor swear words and some scary scenes (when the dragon is chasing them out of the castle) but it is handled well and goes by quickly.  Neither of my kids even noticed the words being uses (I think there are 2 instances in the film) and the dragon scene ends in a funny way.  I really think this is a great film and highly recommend it for all families!

6305949980|5.0|Danny Elfman does a FANTASTIC job scoring this movie. He is by far my favorite movie composer... I have a HUGE amount of respect for him.<br />Even if you don't like this movie, the score is more than worth sitting through this film for.<br />On that note, I'd like to express my love for this movie as well as it's music. The animation is total eye-candy... amazing. Literally a modern-day classic. Tim Burton is God. I love everything he makes... outstanding work.
B00003BDXG|5.0|You have to be a fool to call this movie &quot;inept&quot; or something like that. This is a creation of a skilled director, and it is obviously exactly the way he wanted.<br />With that said, it's not for everyone. The negative reviews on here shows that this kind of art only connects to a certain audience. I personally enjoyed the heck out of it and thought it was perfect.<BR>(I think you gotta be little sick and twisted to feel this way though.)
B000000OQF|5.0|An album many (this reviewer included) considers their best, Guns N' Roses epitomizes the anti-glam metal movement with some of the harshest, bluntest and most hard-hitting music of the time period.  Axl's trademark screech and Slash's blazing anthemic riffs flourish with the later dumped Izzy Stradlin's songwriting.  All of the best GNR songs, the ones that would come to define them in rock history are on this album, from the \\"serpentine\\" Welcome to the Jungle to the arena classic \\"Paradise City\\" to the oddly video-gamish Sweet Child O' Mine.  But don't overlook the rest of this superb album for the sake of it's better known songs - every track completely smokes, from the insidious main riff of Rocket Queen to the wonderfully horrid misogyny of It's So Easy to the dark, catchy flavor of Mr Brownstone.  Finally, don't make the mistake of thinking that this album's age has withered its impact -- Appetite for Destruction has a timeless appeal to any guitarist, any vocalist, and any true rock fan who likes great melodic riffs matched with the power and aggression of one of rock's great frontmen at the peak of his career.  A must-have for any music-lover's collection.
0446530573|2.0|I eagerly awaited the arrival of my copy of the cookbook. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed with it once it arrived. Overall it seemed very contrived and didn't, in my opinion, capture the Sopranos style as I had hoped. If you want a real mafia cookbook, I would recommend the Wiseguy's Cookbook by Henry Hill. It's true to its name. Written by a former wiseguy and it captures the feel of what I expected from the Sopranos cookbook.
B0000542D2|2.0|What went wrong? I was so looking forward to this Dvd release, and when I finally played it, my heart almost stopped from the pain and agony. I thought to myself that finally someone would give this monumental musical comedy film the respect that it deserves. Boy, was I wrong. Now, there are some good points about this version, but there are only a few. First, the widescreen transfer is excellent and very clear and not as dark as the first Dvd version on MPI. Second there are some good extra features such as the original script that can be viewed with the film (as long as you have a DVD rom with your computer). There are so many extras that come with the film that it does get a little monotonous. Interviews with some of the cast, documentaries etc. Now for the drawbacks. The first and most important is the terrible audio. The 5.1 audio is a joke. There is absolutely no discrete signal separation whatsoever. You dont even get the option of choosing the orignal mono soundtrack or the excellent stereo sound that was included with the first DVD release. I had purchased the Yellow Submarine DVD last year and couldnt believe the excellent 5.1 surround sound on that, so I was under the impression that I would be lifted to the highest high (especially with such a highly regarded company like Miramax) when I would hear the begining crash of the title track. Every song on the Dvd sounds like they were recorded in a box. Maybe I should have waited a little while, but these things happen I guess. Hopefully this audio problem will be corrected in the future and it will wind up being a satisfactory version. I also would have like to have a suvenier booklet included since this is supposed to be a collectors edition. No dice. Also one of the biggest  disapointments is NO Paul Mccartney or Ringo Starr interviews. They could have provided alot more stories that probubly havent been told before about the making of the film. Altogether a great letdown. Yeah Yeah Yeah?  NO NO NO!!!
B00006GFAB|3.0|Before I even start, I just want to say \\"Why another greatest hits package?\\" The Very Best of Kiss comes less than a year after their box set of greatest hits material. It follows \\"Double Platinum\\", \\"Smashes, Thrashes, and Hits\\", \\"You Wanted The Best\\", \\"Greatest Kiss\\", plus imports such as \\"Killers\\" and \\"Chikara\\". So why another greatest hits package in the collection, because it is the last Kiss album done for the bands long time label, Mercury Records. This looks to be put out by the record company to fulfill the bands contract.<br />Taking a look at the credits, Kiss had nothing to do with this release. The closest link in the production is tour manager and recent Ace replacement Tommy Thayer, who is listed on the Art Direction credits. The packaging is simple, but the inside sleeve of the disc does have a cool picture of the band from the 1976 Paul Lynde Halloween Special. As with most die hard Kiss fans, I would have much rather seen an album of new material or old demo material. Even the original Wicked Lester demos would have been a much better choice.<br />As for the music, it is a good collection of Kiss tunes. \\"Strutter\\" & \\"Deuce\\" are up first from the bands debut album. Next up are \\"Got To Choose\\" and \\"Hotter Than Hell\\" from \\"Hotter Than Hell\\". \\"C'mon And Love Me\\" and \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\" are next coming off of the bands third album, \\"Dressed To Kill\\".<br />\\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"Shout It Out Loud\\", and \\"Beth\\" are here from \\"Destroyer\\". Following those cuts are \\"\\"I Want You\\", \\"Calling Dr. Love\\", and \\"Hard Luck Woman\\" from \\"Rock and Roll Over\\". The next tunes, \\"I Stole Your Love\\", \\"Christeen Sixteen\\" and \\"Love Gun\\" come from \\"Love Gun\\".<br />The only song to make it off any of the solo albums is Ace Frehley's \\"New York Groove\\". That is followed by \\"Dynasty's\\" \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\". The last song from the make-up era is \\"I Love It Loud\\" from \\"Creatures Of The Night\\".<br />The non-make-up era songs consist of the title track off of \\"Lick It Up\\", \\"Forever\\" from \\"Hot In The Shade\\" and closing the disc is \\"God Gave Rock and Roll To You II\\" off of \\"Revenge\\".<br />These are some great tunes for someone looking to pick up a representation of the bands music on one CD. It would have been cool for the record company to pick just one tune off of every Kiss album for this package. That way you would get a taste of everything Kiss. I think it would have made a much more interesting package. I think what Mercury Records was take the easy way out by throwing some obvious tunes on a CD, packaging it very simply and just putting it out there. Choosing one song off of each album would have been much more work. Doing that would have to make them think a little and come up with an original title like \\"Kiss - The Casablanca / Mercury Years\\".<br />If you're a Kiss fan, you'll want this to keep your collection complete. If you just like the music of Kiss, this does have some very cool music and is much cheaper than the recent box set. If you're just a hard rock / heavy metal fan, this has a taste of the many sides of Kiss. All in all it's worth picking up but not a necessary addition to your music collection.rever\\" from \\"Hot In The Shade\\" and closing the disc is \\"God Gave Rock and Roll To You II\\" off of \\"Revenge\\".<br />These are some great tunes for someone looking to pick up a representation of the bands music on one CD.

B00001U0DP|2.0|I'm in the minority of people who hard a very hard time with this movie.  Yes, there was much that I appreciated about it, especially the magical romance in the first half.  When the action moved to the concentration camp, I wish I had followed my gut instinct and turned the movie off then and there.<br />Setting the rest of this movie in a concentration camp just ddoesn't work for me.  I cannot ignore the knowledge that great cruelty and unimaginable suffering occured in places like this.  <br />If you are a sensitive person, I suggest you skip this movie.  It'll rip your heart out by making you care so deeply about the characters and then.... well I don't want to give away the ending.  Let's just say, I was left very sad, NOT uplifted at all.
6300271285|5.0|I'll be honest. I love this movie. I bought it because my six-year-old son and three-year-old daughter love it, but I had selfish reasons as well. It's fun, funny, and entirely tongue-in-cheek. We all love the music and the story. Rick Moranis is great, Ellen Green is perfect, and you can't help but love Steve Martin as the dentist. If you have any sense of fun in you, get this movie.
0375707972|3.0|This book was an okay read. I haven't read many books with a male perspective and it was a refreshing change to have \\"The Reader\\" tell the story of our male hero. (Most of the books I read have female characters as the main focus).<br />I thought the story was original, and dealt with difficult subject matter: Hannah seducing our hero when he was only 15, the shame and secrecy of illiteracy, and Hannah being put on trial for her crimes in a Nazi concentration camp.  It is not an uplifting story, but it kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next.  I was a bit perplexed at their relationship, and found myself wondering if the only substance to it was of a sexual nature.<br />I found the ending a bit rushed, and not quite satisfying for that reason.  Overall, this book was a very quick read, and is only worth about 3 stars.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is without question the finest animated movie ever and one of the great movies, period. Its hard not to get totally absorbed in this classic version of 'beauty and the beast', where the music is instantly memorable, the voices perfect and the animation beautiful. I especially like the voice of Paige O'Hara, who gives Belle life in a way that few actresses have achieved. There is such emotion in her voice, poignantly so. <BR>The DVD edition is packed with wonderful extras, including an audio commentary that is a lot of fun, three versions of the film(although they are pretty much the same, but interesting nonetheless), games, galleries, documentaries and lots more. It is truly a masterpiece and holds a special spot on my personal list of favorites. Timeless and enchanted, it is as wondrous today as the first day I saw it nearly eleven years ago. Dont rent it, BUY IT.

That's In Utero. Nirvana's follow-up album to the most successful rock record in history, Nevermind. With In Utero they still have the classic raw Nirvana sound they've always produced. It's loaded to the brim with brilliant songs like \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" \\"Rape Me\\" \\"Dumb\\" \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" and \\"All Apologies.\\" Cobain still writes some of his best lyrics as he's always done, like in Heart Shaped Box, \\"Broken hymen of your highness i'm left black, throw down you're umbilical noose so i can climb right back.\\" Some people think Nevermind is better. Some think In Utero is better. it's quite arguable. In Utero is defenitally the best follow-up album they could ever make. 9/10 Highlights: \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" \\"Rape Me\\" \\"Dumb\\" \\"All Apologies\\" \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\"

Either you get it, or you don't, and either you love it, or you hate it; I've never discovered a &quot;middle ground&quot; of opinion about this film.<br />More importantly for you, the RHPS fan, is that you scoop this title up quick!  FOX is quickly putting their special edition DVDs out of print, and already they've begun to replace this excellent 2-disc set with a much less impressive, plain vanilla 1-disc.  The special features and documentary features on this disc are quite good, and though I found the menus a little annoying, they're certainly a minor complaint to this otherwise fine release.  Get it now, before it's gone!
0380977788|4.0|The locked door that opens on a brick wall one day opens on a similar but different world. Very different. Her mother and father over there... aren't, but so want to be. The strange cat around the property talks. And Coraline must figure out what went wrong and make things right. To beat an often used phrase around, it's a modern fairy tale, written much like the old ones. It's scary and strange and not at all happy in parts. Which is it's charm.<br />Gaiman captures the spirit of a child's confusion about grow-ups handily and twists the love of parents wickedly. Coraline is refreshingly young but not incabable as so many writer's tend to make children. She has a child's distrust of weird foods and plenty of imagination (and a cat) to help her on her journey. And well, it's Gaiman with the illustrated help of Dave McKean, perfect in his off-kilter style. Yes, it's a.. I won't say children's book, perhaps more for the 10-16 set (what is that young adult? I never know), but I enjoyed it easily.
B000021YQV|4.0|Having not purchased SOAD's first cd, I had labeled them one-hit wonders after I heard the song &quot;Sugar.&quot;  When &quot;Spiders&quot; became a hit, I was genuinely surprised.  When I first heard &quot;Chop Suey,&quot; then learned it was from them, I knew 3 songs were no fluke.  I picked up this cd the day it came out, and I must say, I have been greatly impressed by this cd.  The way they can incorporate Middle-Eastern styles into hard rock is amazing to me, and the vocal talents of Serj are hardly limited to screaming.  I can't wait to hear the next offering from these guys, hopefully they can step it up one more notch.
0441172717|5.0|\\"Dune\\" begins with a spiritual awakening of Paul Atreides, heir to the Atreides noble House and son of a defiant Bene Gesserit, Jessica. Just as the House is forced by circumstance to move to the planet Arrakis (Dune) and take it over from the Harkonnens, Paul enters adulthood. He is different; mature for his age through his noble upbringing and aware beyond the norm thanks to his mother's 'special' training.<br />Through his father's intelligence network, Paul comes to realise that moving to Arrakis is not as straightforward as it seems. There are sublte undertones of byplays and \\"tricks within tricks within tricks\\". The Emperor, the House Harkonnen, and the Fremen who cultivate the precious but deadly addictive spice on Arrakis all have a hand in the game.<br />No sooner have the Atreides arrived, in fact, and an attempt is made on Paul's life; and a little later, his father is murdered by a traitor. Circumstance would have it that Paul and his mother make a lucky escape from the hands of the Harkonnens who are behind his father's murder. Or is it the Harkonnens?<br />Paul and Jessica are thrown into the desert, an environment so harsh and unforgiving that survival appears impossible. It is Paul's determination, training, but mostly, his unquestioned willingness to accept the new environment for what it is, that eventually help them to hook up with the Fremen who have been a thorn in the Harkonnen's side. From there, Paul and his mother can build a base that will allow them to challenge the Harkonnens and seek revenge for the Duke's death and regain control of Arrakis. But, unbeknownst to his mother, Paul aims higher ...<br />The entire novel is stunning. It is rich and intriguing without being overly complex. The writing flows for easy reading without over-analysis. There are plans within plans, and interesting tangents. Herbert built complete people, communities, religions, and even an entire planet. Arrakis is a real, dry, dusty, harsh world, easily padded out in the reader's imagination (you'll get thirsty reading this book!). The book encompasses political motivation, economic dependency, spiritual awakening, ecological limitation, love, revenge, war and the human ability to persist, overcome and achieve.<br />But first and foremost, \\"Dune\\" is an amazing story and a pleasure to read.

B0000640VO|4.0|Gamine Audrey Tautou is beautifully cast as the shy young waitress who can make everyone happy but herself.  You see a gorgeous, primary colored, clean Paris through her eyes, and it is a sight to behold!  Amelie, though a very empathetic character, is not saccharine.  People who offend her are tricked.  She is devious in her methods of bringing joy and settling scores.<br />I particularly liked the Frenchness (for lack of a better word) of the film.  The French have a pragmatic, relaxed view of sex that is so at odds with the serious and rather frantic importance we Americans give to the subject.  Now food, on the other hand, is a very serious business and not casual at all to the French.  I noticed all kitchens, no matter how small, were fully equipped with every type of blender, beater and bowl (but not necessarily appliances.)  When Amelie eats a solitary dinner, she sets the table, has a glass of wine and three carefully prepared courses.<br />When Amelie falls in love, her shyness about does her in.  She is fearless at helping others, but almost paralyzed at helping herself.  You really pull for her even while getting a little exasperated with her hide and seek methods.  There is enough comedy throughout to keep the film from being oversweet. <br />The DVD:  The color is excellent, the sound good and the images sharp and clear.  The package is good and interesting.  There are subtitles in English and Spanish, no dubbing.  People who are slow readers may have problems with following the action and the subtitles, as it is the type of film that demands your visual attention.
B00005B36H|2.0|I don't know how Tool has avoided all association from other bands.  Ok, they have associations with Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, and Genesis.  I don't understand that only when you start sounding like Led Zeppelin you will be critized for it.  The lead singer of Tool had blatantly stole costumes from Peter Gabriel.  Original live shows, no.  Original songs, not as much as many Tool fans thinks.  But, imitation is not a horrible thing, when it comes to music like Rock, Jazz, Blues, but not pop music.  So, Tool does have some impressive assortment of influences that guarantees a huge fan base with the fans being partly blinded to the fact that having strong influences and not being original can still be a good thing.  It's a good thing if Tool has the talent to pull it off and does not too far from a standard song of Genesis, Pink Floyd, and Jethro Tull.  (And doesn't the lead singer of Tool sound a lot like Ian Anderson?)<BR>  Yes, Tool does have talent, but sometimes their formula is off the mark and demands some original sounds.  <br />  Forget about the trilogy of Tool, because I don't need to bring up the concept albums of Pink Floyd to dismiss it, but a recent band named Pearl Jam who don't only told a twisted story but no one could have knew.  <br />  They do have great music videos, but even the video Schism isn't original, and rips off an 80's horror flick with Drew Barriemore in it.  <br />  ...
B000002UUX|5.0|I only actually own three of Megadeth's albums,(though they are generally considered to be their best work) so I'm not in too much of a position to compare it to all of their work, but from what I know this is the fastest, most complicated stuff they've done. It's the most solid album I've heard from them from beginning to end, though it still has a few weaker spots.(The title track isn't to great, and Hangar 18 isn't as good as everyone else makes it out to be, though nothing on here is really bad.) It's not as nearly as consistent as Metallica's stuff from the same era, but it's still a solid album, and well worth the time of any metal fan.<br />The main weakness of this album, as with most classic thrash is the production. The sound quality on this album is utter ... IMO, it sounds worse than ...And Justice For All. Everything comes through fairly clearly, but the guitars are pathetically weak sounding, at least compared to how they are supposed to sound.(Though it wasn't as clear, the production on Peace Sells had a lot more power than this one does.) It doesn't ruin the album, but it's impossible for me not to notice it.<br />The reviewers here love to go on and on about how technical this album is, and while it certainly is, it should be noted that how good an album is isn't proportional to how difficult it is to play. This is in fact the single greatest musical weakness to this cd, because Mustaine and Friedman frequently seem more concerned with playing endless guitar solos than actually writing songs. Don't misunderstand me, many of the solos are great, especially on Tornado of Souls, but they go way overboard on some songs, especially on Hangar 18. That song contains about 10 solos too many.  The other problem is that that the great technicality of Megadeth is the only real distinguishing trait they have. They aren't as fast or heavy as Slayer, as energetic as Anthrax or nearly as good of songwriter's as Metallica. Still, when they don't get obsessed with perpetual soloing the song writing is quite strong.  The songs aren't terribly long, but they generally don't write 3 minute pop songs either.  The instrumental parts of the album that aren't just endless soloing are generally very good, especially the introduction to Five Magics and Tornado of Souls, which is good because the vocals aren't to great. However, they are better than average for Megadeth, and thrash metal and Megadeth's appeal has always lain primarily in the instruments anyway.  Mustaine's lyrics aren't too brilliant either, but you can hardly ever understand him anyway.<br />The best tracks include Take No Prisoners, which is traditional thrash, the punky Poison Was The Cure and the very Metallica-ish Tornado of Souls.<br />So, this is very good, though not great metal, and you should buy it.<br />9/10perpetual soloing the song writing is quite strong.

B00006EXDM|4.0|Since this is the definitive collection of the Stones pre-Exile work it is a must have for any fan.   The bad part is this SACD scam.  The sound is more enhanced, but in an un-natural sort of way.  Music companies are pushing this format to combat the cd-r and mp3 revolution.  If you like to burn back-up copies or play music on your computer, you're out of luck.   This disc can not be decoded on most computers.  Remember...all of these SACD Stones cds were originally recorded on pre-1970 analog equipment.  The original remastered version of \\"Hot Rocks\\" sounds identical to this one (as do all the SACD versions)  when played  on \\"non\\" SACD eqipment. So unless you have the higher end player, there is no need ot upgrade or spend more money on these newer releases.
B000007MVX|5.0|Coming off Thick As A Brick, I could see why these guys who want to give it another try. This is an improvement over Thick As A Brick. They were prepared for writing one song album. I think the instrumental pieces in this song are more entertaining, and easier to listen to compared to Thick As A Brick. It's more uplifting, and has a larger range of parts than Thick As A Brick, which is a reason for it being better. The Newpapers of Thick As A Brick is cool, but speaking about the music, this is the more mature and experienced approach to a full length album. Some of the parts have similarities to Tubular Bell's by Mike Oldfield, which I think was released the same year.<br />The lyrics are better, with a interesting story.  The singing is less folky.

Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, Dave Brubeck's Take Five, John Coltrane's Love Supreme, Ella Fitzgerald with Count Basie, Jobim's Wave. I am certain Ms. Krall's latest live CD will join the elite group. . . heavenly music resulting from technical perfection coupled with musicianship, lyricism, and a humility to anchor her unique talents in the great musical tradition that precedes her.

As the movie progresses however, Jackie & Isabel bond over certain experiences. Anna who is having difficulty accepting her father's new fiance, struggles in her every day life, but in the end learns to accept the situation. ... The movie is a touching tale about how a family comes together through crisis, and learns to live with each other again. This is definately a tear jerker, but the performances are strong all around. I highly reccomend this movie.

You have Ringo pursued by the Cult, a Mad Scientist bent on (Dare We Say It)ruling the world while complaining about British parts in his scientific tools, Paul shrunk into an ashtray and coverd with soda (\\"ick, I'm all sticky...\\") and John suggesting Ringo cut his hand off to save the free world. Not to mention George cheating at cards, a channel swimmer emerging in an alpine lake asking directions to the White Cliffs of Dover, and an inept pack of Kali worshippers in a schilling cab equipped with Bond-like accessories.<br />Did I mention the soundtrack? You WILL stand in front of the telly and sing along with every single song, because each one has comedic scenes, and just because we all know them.<br />The movie abounds with impromptu humor (mostly from John, oh how we miss him) and sight gags.<br />This is NOT an easy DVD to find, and it is a must have for any fan or collector, Beatle or otherwise.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I remember hearing &quot;I've seen it all&quot; on Radio 1, Spring, 2 years ago. It was one of those jaw dropping moments when music puts me in a trance. That doesn't happen very often. I bought the CD when it came out. It sounds like what it is, a film soundtrack. However, the music stands up on its own. I didn't see &quot;Dancer In The Dark&quot; until a year later. The tracks are definately Bjork in sound and feel, yet the style is totaly &quot;Musical&quot;, and with &quot;Musical's&quot; intense emotion and Bjork's songwriting ability, I found this album very powerful.<BR>I could waffle on for pages, so I'll keep it short.<BR>&quot;Overture&quot; is a brass band piece. Does what it says on the tin.<BR>&quot;Cvalda&quot; is a great exercise in writing a musical number.<BR>&quot;I've seen it all&quot;. Dueting with Thom Yorke was a very good idea.<BR>This song has caught me off guard and brought me to tears more than once. And that's not counting the actual lyrics, just the sound. Definition of beauty.<BR>&quot;Scatterheart&quot; is dark in tone and makes the least sense unless you see the film.<BR>&quot;In the musicals&quot; is the most up tempo one. Makes hardly any sense, but the best musical numbers never do. Very cleverly written with soaring strings and a very inventive percussion section.<BR>&quot;107 steps&quot; is my least favourite, but to prove Bjork's talent and love of music she can even make counting to 107 sound beautiful.<BR>&quot;New world&quot; with graceful lyrics and the easiest sounding delivery, the orchestra slowly building to near breaking point,<BR>ending with the theme from &quot;Overture&quot;.<BR>The songs have been changed here and there from the way they are in the film. &quot;I've seen it all&quot; works better with Thom Yorke, and &quot;Scatterheart&quot; doesn't work as well to me, but I'm trying to find flaws.<BR>Over all, Bjork brings orchestral music together with dance music<BR>ideas and makes them work on orchestral terms,(usually it's the other way round) with all the depth and emotion that entails. The fact that it's a musical soundtrack is almost coincidental. The idea of using everyday sounds to inspire music has never been done this well before.<BR>There you go, that's enough. Buy it.
0380789035|3.0|Neil Gaiman is someone who I read as a novelist, I've yet to go for his comic work, though I read illustrated work, so it's not unusual for me to pick up this book.  Shadopw, the protagonist of this book is many things-----first we suspect that he is the mbodiment of a God as a lot of the main characters in this book are.  If he is the son of Odin, then is he Thor?<br />Or is he just a man sired by a God and brought to the brink of reality as one form of God fights others?<br />A variety of Gods make appearances here as a form of Armageddon approaches.  I wish I could say that this novel had a strong central point but it spins around this coming war and how to avert it with Shadow's dead wife walking around.  Shadow eventually sacrifices himself as a vigil to Odin-----all of this occuring with the 20th century.<br />What works in this novel?<br />The origin/genesis of the gods on American soil and their human incarnations and how Shadow sees glimpses of their power.<br />What doesn't work?<br />At the end of this novel you realize Gaiman has done a lot of setting up, a lot of creation of mythos into his own multi-Godded world but to what end?<br />Gods are everywhere, everyone, which is a terrific concept, strong and I believe to some degree the truth of existence, but the war/commentary on God in America is rather empty by the end.  The book goes nowhere.  Yes, Shadow finds the light within, finds purpose, reason to be but we never think that the world is in any danger.  Perhaps this is because teh opposing Gods are technology, TV, the Internet.  This book should've been expanded, travelled more.  Perhaps a trilogy, there's a lot to be mined here, relationships to be explored.  But in one book it feels like a prelude and smacks of being cut short too quickly.
B00003CXFV|5.0|This movie chronicles the real life story of ERIN BROCKOVICH who defied the odds and brought about change in a small town, where its people were becoming increasingly sick from contaminated water. She fought for their rights, and defied the odds in bringing justice to the community. We meet Erin, played by Julia Roberts wonderfully, who is involved in a car accident and suffers from a fractured neck. Erin is a single mother of three, who manages to get a job with her lawyer by manuevering herself into his office and demanding a job. Erin doesn't take any b.s. and speaks her mind. She gets into everyone's face. Eventually she falls in love with the man living next to her and its a rollercoaster relationship as he tries to deal with her becoming increasingly more busy as time progresses. The movie was well paced and very well acted. I reccomend it if you enjoy inspiring movies, that are well acted. Julia Roberts outshone them all in this film.
