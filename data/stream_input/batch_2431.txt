B003YL4LYI|4.0|This was the 5th book in a series I could not put down.  Writing these books seems to have become this author's career  and reading them has become mine.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|I installed it and ran it on both my Android One X and my windows 7 desktop, and couldn't connect, so it's either bad or too complicated to setup, and in both cases a waste of time
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I wasn't sure at first because the movie had subtitles but honestly thought this movie was charming, funny, and interesting. It was unexpected and I loved it.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I had watched Dr. Mosley on PBS and I wanted to buy his book.  I am very satisfied with it.<br />I purchased this item for a relative who is in a skilled nursing facility.  I had previously purchased the first two seasons<br />of Downton Abbey for her, and she loved them so I bought season 3 for her birthday.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I was very entertained by this edition in the Ironman series, It was much better then I expected and look forward to watching it again.  it puts some interesting twists in possible up coming marvel movies that could be interesting.<br />Downey did a great part in this one as well as his other supporting casts.<br />Great movie and it's a must see for any of the marvel movie fans out there.  Stan Lee will be worth more when he dies then he is today I bet!!!<br />check it out
1780721676|1.0|I watched Dr Mosley on PBS and I wanted to buy his book.  I have been on the 5:2 diet and it is the easiest<br />and most effective diet that I've ever followed.<br />I would recommend it to everyone and I have, in fact, purchased another copy for a relative.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl's writing is engaging and the topic is essential.  Like Sheryl, I spent my time in school and even early career thinking that we had arrived; in fact, I have had women cheer my success as a female engineer who gets dirty on construction sites and tells everyone what to do and has two small children as proof that we have finally arrived at true equality.  The book is well written and I am grateful that she is speaking up and bringing the conversation forward.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|This is not a cheapy teen horror flick which normally runs under 90 mins.<br />This film is 110 mins long with a completely thought through story and a satisfying ending.<br />Ethan Hawke lent his acting credibility to elevate this film above any normal horror film.<br />It is intense, well acted and directed film.<br />A good solid horror film.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Nice game. However,  there is no information on the tournaments, the flaming diamonds and other pertinent rules.<br /><br />Tell me more about bombs and other magic. What is my objective???
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|This is primarily a Spanish production with the director of \\"The Orphanage\\", a well-made horror film of completely different genre.<br />This is truly an impressive follow up film for the young director who managed to make a disaster film with a well-told true story,<br />fine acting and impressive special effects. The film shows the triumph of human spirit with family love and loss.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Awesome show with wit and intellect. Better than most shows guys are cool and funny. Women are gorgeous and smart..... Yes you too Penny! Give ally teeth and rate GI Joe number 1 to be a part of it lol
B008220DGE|4.0|This is a mesmerizing yet difficult film to watch for its 2hr 20 mins length (it seems longer).<br />It is about a traumatized WW2 veteran who stumbled upon a self-proclaimed guru of scientific religion<br />who took him under his wing.<br />The acting was great, especially Joaquin Phoenix who transformed himself into a modern day Quasimodo.<br />No actor working today can match his acting ability with possible exception of Daniel Day Lewis.<br />Philip Seymour Hoffman holds his court as well, in a \\"less showy\\" role.<br />Technically this film is brilliant, in terms of photography, period details, music and production design.<br />The problem that many viewers cannot appreciate the film is because that both protagonists were<br />difficult to like, difficult to understand and appreciate.<br />The film was further weighed down by a novel-like inconclusive ending.<br />A more difficult film than \\"There Will Be Blood\\" but a worthy follow-up of similar quality and standard.<br />A must for lovers of challenging yet rewarding films.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I felt like there was too much extra information that wasn't necessary to build the story.  I found myself skipping paragraphs and pages just to get to the meat of the story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Simply amazing, the words flow like good champagne. You should read this book, for it will change you in one or more way.
6304712499|5.0|very good movie watch it as a kid and now im showing my kids the good movies and the loved it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I had heard of the series and was eager to start this book. I really enjoyed all of the creative details that went into this book. I thought the author did a really good job at creating a back story for each of the characters. I also enjoyed the fact that the conclusion to the story was simple and to the point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is so great . It challenges you to do your whatever level and gives you a variety of settings in the games
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just truly enjoyed this series. I'd recommend it (and do) to everyone. It is excellently written and truly makes you feel for the characters.
B008602KQI|2.0|not enough blood, and too slow starting off. This feels like a really bad remake of battle royale. That is all I have left to say.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|love the touch interface that jump uses.  Makes controlling full desktop machine from my phone a breeze. Try it for yourself!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it definitely the best book ever! Get it if your not to young to read it! It's very sexual
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun to play and it makes me relax after a long days work. My kids taught me how to play and competing with friends on facebook makes it really interesting.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Since loving the book, it is always important to me to consider how well the story is adapted to the screen.  I found it ties in with the trilogy well, though using Frodo in the Hobbit is a new idea.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I found it challenging but workable all the way through.  I will definitely order more games from this series.  Thanks.
B00003CXB7|4.0|While I love the TV series I bought the movie for my husband. His comment was that he hoped our (grown young) sons never heard the words to the theme song &#34;Suicide is Painless&#34;. I don't approve of the sexual situations in either the movie or show but that is me.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|The display is upside down and no matter what settings are used it can't be corrected.  Too bad.  It could have been very useful.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|What can I say.  These guys are brilliant.  I love everything they do.  A Classic that holds up. See it. You won't be disappointed unless you didn't like &#34;Raising Arizona, Fargo, etc.
B003B02O0A|5.0|What can  I say John Grisham is at his best in this story of stories.  A great book that should be read by all..
B00BZODDYU|4.0|I didn't get a chance to see this movie in theaters.  My husband dislikes supernatural or horror movies.  I'm alone on this subject.<br />I loved it.  Very atmospheric and I jumped quite a few times.  I bought it without seeing it and was not disappointed!<br />If you like a good, creepy ghost stories, then give it a try.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|So far this charger has been able to charge everything I can throw at it.<br /><br />It feels very well built, and doesn't even get warm when in use!<br /><br />Keep up the good work Anker!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game. The update for the graphics was quite often, so we don't get bored. Updated feature. Less advertisement compare to other free apps. Fun to play for younger kids too. Could have more varieties on the difficulty rather than being faster.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is so fun I can't stop playing it. So much fun can't stop playing it forever. This game is so addictive!!!!!!!!!!
B000MVN8GK|4.0|Sad that it's the last season. It's a great show. I love the characters. The show can get pretty dark, but also very realistic. Looking forward to the movie next year!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|When attached to a hd tv the game looks so cool! BUT IT IS SNEAKY...full of in app purchases you can very easily fall prey to...i really dislike that...I would have given it 5 stars but having to be careful not to accidentally purchase more than you want...takes away the fun...you could easily spend over $10 on this app if you're not careful...especially if a child is playing...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everyone was raving about this series, so we gave it a try and became instantly hooked on it.  We can't get enough!!
B008S4FZHI|5.0|I am an ardent fan of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books so I selected this one hoping it would be as good as her others.<br />It was even more engaging because she was more involved in the crimes on her table in the CRC and had a jealous FBI agent who was working with her husband Benton, trying to undermine her at every step and take Benton off her. To give her a name Douglas,<br />was dangerous to everyone including herself.. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes captivating drama/mysteries.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I got hooked on this while on a trip.  I don't get this particular channel at home, so I can't wait to watch the next season to see what happens.  The villain is perfect - or is he one?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This os hands down the best game ever and it is free and a real time passer or you can just play it when you are board
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am so hooked on this series, and I can't wait for next year's season.  Sadly though without two major characters.
B00AEUPOVQ|2.0|It just didn't jum out to me and it was quiet boring..would not recommend it to a friend..sorry, truthful tho
B008P1EWIM|3.0|The app is okay but does not rotate view as the screen rotates.  Had I known this I would have chosen another app.
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|There is no difficulty level that is at all easy unless you are extremely lucky. The glyphs almost seem to conspire against you at certain points, but it is a very engaging game on which I personally am hooked. I give it 4 out of 5 stars because of the glyph thing, otherwise it would have gotten 5.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So far so good just started playing, very nice game for Horse lover's or young children.  This is a very easy game to ply.
B009SBSQOO|5.0|With this sophomore release, Pablo Alboran cements his position as one of Europes best exports.  If you like ballads with an Andalucian flair, this one is for you.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thank you for living your life for something bigger than your self, and inspiring others to achieve greatness. God bless the US Navy!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I was very impressed by the easy access through the wii. The quality was great and the selection is very nice! Plus it was free since I've got prime!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Makes me think about the many possibilities that could be out there, as well as all the preconceptions we tend to have. It is also a good read on the grounds of exploring how our interactions with others can have radically different impacts, especially based on each individual's perspective of the situation.  Aside from all that, it is a classic.
1596177373|5.0|Unique, very Burton playing cards. Exactly what we were expecting.  Easy to see numbers and easy to distinguish suits and faces.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game but I get annoyed when I can't win a collection item or even bingo for a week at a time
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|pick this up for a great free game on your kindle. only concern is level of difficulty for my younger son who really wants to play it
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Shantaram is not just a good book it is a great book! Gregory David Roberts writes so eloquently that I felt like I was there beside him, experiencing what he was experiencing and feeling what he was feeling. I could smell the scents of the spices and taste the delicious chai on my tongue. Mostly I could feel the love he  has for a country full of contradictions, and dualities, but mostly full of humanity with all its shades of black whites and grays. I was left with a longing to go to India so that I might carry on the love affair with it that Gregory David Roberts has started within me. I had trouble putting the book  down, and the characters stayed with me, like good friends, well after I came to the end of the story. I hope to read many more of his books in the coming years. Exceptionally well written. Thank you Mr. Roberts.
0307477479|4.0|I thought this was pretty good. To me it felt like I was reading a 90s independent art film where a variety of people's stories are told and the viewer is left to figure out how it all fits together. Each chapter is a different character from the previous chapter, but all the characters' lives intersect in some way or at some time. Some reviewers complained that the cover made it seem like the book was about music. It is, but only as a context. Not as a major theme, really. The edition I read had a cover with different transparent people in different colors all doing a different motion, and all superimposed on each other. This is a brilliant cover and perfectly represents the concept of the novel.<br /><br />There were moments that I absolutely loved, like Sasha's opening chapter. She is so open and vulnerable to us, it's charming. I also absolutely loved the powerpoint chapter. I thought it was a brilliant way to create narrative out of an alternative format, and the story it told really came through to me. I heard an interview on NPR recently where publishers are able to tell when readers skip parts of a book on their ereader. Jennifer Egan was interviewed because her publishers have discovered that most readers skip the powerpoint chapter, and she was asked if she thought that perhaps she should have either left it out or written it differently. She responded that she felt the powerpoint chapter was the most important chapter in the whole book. That being said, I looked forward to reading the chapter and was not disappointed.<br /><br />There are some things that are \\"tricksy\\" about the novel, such as the powerpoint chapter, the footnotes a la David Foster Wallace, and the multiple viewpoints. It didn't always seem like it was crucial to the story, and for me wasn't where Egan excelled. Instead, she excelled at getting into the minds of her characters and carefully describing their world. As I writer, I find it hard to use such devices, especially ones that havebeen done before to great success. It makes it feel like the writer is trying too hard, much like those 90s movies always felt like they were trying to hard, at the expense of the enjoyment of its audience.<br /><br />In retrospect, I realized that the only chapters that felt like they were a 90s indie film were chapters that were most likely SET in the 90s or 00s. The chapters set in the future felt different, in a way that seemed appropriate for their time period. The fact that I felt the 90s and 00s means that Egan did her work well. I didn't particularly enjoy them because I never liked those kinds of films, and frankly it's hard going into a pulitzer prize winning novel about contemporary topics without a little bit of skepticism and a bar set pretty darn high for perfection. Especially when it's been so often related to David Foster Wallace, who I thought was just brilliant. But the more I think about Egan's novel, the more I appreciate about what she did. It doesn't hit me over the head with powerful things, but I do think it's a slow burn.<br /><br />Ultimately, I enjoyed the book on several different levels. I'm a slow reader, and so when I went back to Goon Squad I had to remind myself not only of what was happening in the chapter I was on, but also what had happened to all the other people, and when, and how it might relate to or impact the current chapter. I don't think that's a fair way to read a book like Goon Squad, because so much of what makes a chapter relate is done in the sort of subtle way that happens in life. That being said, I look forward to reading it again, all the way through. Maybe on a long plane trip or a beach vacation where I've left my laptop at home and my cellphone is dead.
B0056TYT66|5.0|This card works great. Probably not for speed freaks who want to get the last 10% of bandwidth on the USB3 or the SATA connection. Chances are, though, that this card goes plenty fast for most of the add-ons out there. I easily hit 330 MB/s with drives I ripped out of old USB 2.0 external devices, increasing performance by at least an order of magnitude.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|this game disapoints me majorly. it was fun up until you are required to spend money. gameloft needs to change this.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|This is so uplifting, makes you want to get up and have 'Happy Feet' Just love it, great to use while exercising.
B00005QCVY|5.0|A great classic that should be a part of every movie lover's collection! I watch it every Christmas season at least once.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|I've owned each of the various 're-masters' of Tommy, and this one is the closest in sound and feel to my original Decca LP (lost oh so long ago). The 1996 re-master is excellent, but this is most like the original LP pressing before MCA absorbed the Decca catalogue and cheapened all their product. But, buyer beware!!!!!!.......in an era where everyone downloads and CD packaging is an exercise in cutting corners, this iteration comes WITHOUT the accompanying booklet advertised in the original pressing of the Deluxe Edition. The thumb-cut is still in the verso panel, but no booklet is to be found. Ok....contact Universal Music.....good luck, the various mergers and buyouts of the record industry make it near to impossible to find any contact info for customer service, so you'll be outta luck.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|I loved this movie before the HD Blue Ray upgrade, but with it the landscapes are breathtaking. Too bad we can't get the Mancini score upgraded as well.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|I liked the movie; however, I do not feel that Tom Cruise should have played Jack Reacher.  I have read all of Lee Child's books and Jack Reacher (in the book) is about 6 foot tall and muscular.  I would have preferred someone else portraying Jack Reacher. I hope that Tom Cruise will not be portraying Lee Child's &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; in future films.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books I've read for a long time. This is a fascinating look at a near future where the OASIS, a cyberspace virtual reality has consumed the waking hours of almost everyone. OASIS is a combination of workplace, school, entertainment and MMORPG, like The Sims meets World of Warcraft or EverQuest. Apart from being a lot of fun, there is a non-lecturing undertone about the pros and cons of such an addictive immersive reality and Cline has really thought about how it would work.<br /><br />There are some great characters who we see as their avatars in the OASIS and in real life, and I totally rooted for them all the way through to the very satisfying ending. Super villains along the way. It's a great story.<br /><br />The real magic of this book is the endless reference to 80's culture (which is core to the entire plot), be it books, music, nerdy stuff like Dungeons & Dragons and of course video games, LOTS of video game classics. If you grew up in the 80's, this is a fantastic reminiscent romp into your childhood. I think I recognized every single reference, simultaneously grinning like a Cheshire Cat. This is a total Mecca for nerds and geeks. I fondly remember playing the very same D&D scenario that features prominently in the book.<br /><br />If any of what I have written sounds familiar to you, you absolutely have to read this book!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I put this on my vacation \\"to read\\" list, along with Larry Correia's latest Monster Hunter novel and and \\"Omega Days\\" by John Campbell. On a whim I started \\"Ready Player One\\" first, and buzzsawed through it in the first few days. Definitely the most fun I've had reading a novel this year, and perhaps for all time. I did have some issues with the ending (it was rather abrupt), but I suppose it did set up the sequel (fingers crossed). All lovers of 80's everything and geekdom in general should pick this novel up, as it's well worth a read.
B002FFVF1G|5.0|I am thrilled to  see this movie again its been so  long  since watching it ;glad amazon  offed it tome.
0385349831|5.0|What a great book Paulo has put together here. Easy to read, certainly provides thought provoking perspective on life and applicable to the world we live in today.  Get it!
B007QJBHRS|5.0|I was so thrilled when my daughter told me amazon had this movie; I had been looking for it in all the movie places online and could'nt find it.  Its one of my favorites.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|fun<br /><br />it's a fun game.  I had originally downloaded it for my 4 year old to play, but it's a bit too advanced for her. I enjoy it though.
B004VFK5LO|5.0|It is suspenseful and as always Weaver is great.  I've seen it many times and watch it again occasionally.  It's never dull and always keeps you on your toes.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I love his style of writing; you feel like a combination of being there with him in the story and sitting across a kitchen table with Mitch Albom listening to him like old friends talking over a cup if coffee
B00BMT9SQA|4.0|It appears to be a bit slow at times but overall it is a decent movie.  It's humorous but not out loud laughable.
B000002PCS|5.0|In my opinion, &#34;Somewhere In Time&#34; is one of the most beautiful musical compositions ever created. I believe that composer, John Barry, must have been &#34;in love&#34; when he composed it. It really beautifully communicates with the inner soul.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I enjoyed the story as it was told from both sides of the war. The history told in this book made a lot of good points about how men on both sides felt
B00005N6KG|5.0|My old Sony headphones broke because I yanked on them by mistake at the gym. I find ear buds very uncomfortable, and foam headphones too hot when I am working out. These headphones are just perfect. This is my 3rd pair in 12 yrs. and I think every pair would have lasted longer if I wasn't so rough on them. This is the only style of headphones I would buy, and I would only buy Sony because of the quality of sound.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers there's nothing that is bad it is cool I like that it is kind of like temple run but ur not staying on one lane in subway surfers u have a lot of lanes and u don't have to lean to get coins and fall of the edge if I were u I would pick subway surfers!!:)
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is so addictive that its hard to stop playing once you start, the different levels keep you going and going no matter where you at you will always want to play.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Very entertaining, a lot of replay value here.seriously been jealous of ios over this game, and now we finally have it here. Highly recommended. Buy and support indie games.
B004WDRT1Y|3.0|the effects of the 3d was disappointing.The 3d was only noticeble in some of the film.....don't know what else to say
B000QCS8TW|5.0|i have only been reading the first of this series, and have lost myself in the world of the 7 kingdoms
B000O8OTNC|5.0|If you have knives or edged tools of any kind, I don't know why you wouldn't buy this tool. It is seriously the most useful item I have ever purchased for my knives and swords. I'm an avid afficionado and collector of weapons, and I don't know how I managed without this until now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!You can take care of your horse by feeding it , petting it , grooming it and so much more!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is the best one yet. I'm just hoping they don't get greedy and start really pushing transactions on you in the game.
B00AJAFNIA|2.0|When I first opened the game (and it forced portrait mode), I noticed the Privacy button.  Clicking it opened my browser to the company's privacy page.  Lo and behold, in the middle, there is a link to Flurry Analytics.<br /><br />Flurry Analytics gathers information about YOUR device, and is one of those companies you don't want snooping on your phone or anything else you own.<br /><br />Not only that, the game collects information about what other apps you are using or have recently used and sends that information back to the developer (and Flurry Analytics).<br /><br />By the way, just to give you a sense of why you should be concerned about Flurry, read this front-page blurb, from the Director of analytics at Flurry, who wrote in her blog post:<br />\\"Flurry now measures apps used on more than 1 billion smartphones and tablets each month. As connected devices reach critical mass, marketers are more seriously incorporating mobile into the marketing mix. But there are pros and cons.  While the collective size of the mobile audience is rivaling that of TV and other media, it still requires aggregating the audiences of many apps to reach what can be reached through a few TV programs.  That said, the numbers are likely closer than you think.  Additionally, mobile offers unique ways to engage consumers given its \\"always on, always present\\" characteristics.\\"<br /><br />I recommend reading the entire article on flurry.com's site; you will find it illuminating, if not frightening.<br /><br />Regarding the game, the premise is that you have to chase a butterfly to the top of the screen while collecting stars and avoiding the monster at the bottom.  There's no instructions on how to control the guy, and there's no real sense, other than a confusing comic at the beginning of the game, about what is going on and why you are doing what you're doing.<br /><br />The music, sound, and graphics are nothing terribly special, though they are better than average but not by much.<br /><br />I installed the game, ran it, played it for a few minutes, uninstalled it, and feel a little dirtier for the effort from knowing that I put this spying app on my device.<br /><br />By the way, there is NO In-App Purchasing in the game, which is a little bit of a relief.<br /><br />There are worse, and more dangerous, apps out there, and the game is not terrible, so I gave it a second star.  Stop the spying, and I'll consider giving it another star, and instructions might garner an additional star beyond that.><br />I installed the game, ran it, played it for a few minutes, uninstalled it, and feel a little dirtier for the effort from knowing that I put this spying app on my device.<br /><br />By the way, there is NO In-App Purchasing in the game, which is a little bit of a relief.<br /><br />There are worse, and more dangerous, apps out there, and the game is not terrible, so I gave it a second star.

0321543726|4.0|I was required to read this book for my introductory programming course as a Computer Engineering major. I found it challenging to thoroughly read its ~1050+ pages within the span of a semester, but in the end very rewarding. The book continuously builds upon techniques and language features introduced just pages ago (sometimes they're quite advanced), so a patience for revisiting previous material and perhaps a pen and notepad will help you keep up. Occasionally, Dr. Stroustrup uses a vocabulary word or language feature that has not already been explained, but just a few pages later he will enlighten you. The book is excellent if you keep in mind these things. The best part of completing it was knowing that I had glimpsed nearly all of C++'s main features. Hopefully others will have the same success.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|After going through all the steps and installing the program, when I try to download my first music which was free, It was mandatory to enter credit card info.<br />How about letting us know first about the credit card.  I deleted the whole program.
B001P36OY2|1.0|I rented this movie for a 24 hour period and it never loaded. When I went back to watch it- Ususally you have 28 days, it was gone.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Pros:<br />People who can act - they aren't just pretty faces reciting lines<br />Gorgeous sets, props and cinematography<br />Storyline with the perfect balance of drama, romance and humor<br />Unbelievable plot twists: even for someone who has read the book, some things have changed, and they're for the better<br /><br />Cons:<br />I don't have nearly enough time to watch this series
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The entire movie is shot like a 1960s classic with sepia tones and a quirky story. I really loved it. The character development was very rich.
B00280LYHS|5.0|great way to end. liked the book. another good job by rick. also ive read this 10 times maybe more
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good clear graphics, puzzles were challenging but not so hard to make you want to quit. I liked the maps easier to use than in many games
B008YRVW0I|5.0|If it weren't for the fact that it's 4;30 in the morning, I'd keep playing and taking care of my two fish Eva &amp; Diva ;o) !!
B004EK91LQ|5.0|My 14 year old aon and I both love these movies. My son and I both have watched every Step up movie. My son and his friends now get together and video themselves trying to do the same moves as in these movies.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|I bought this because I really liked their album Fallen. I wasnt dissapointed! They are touching, and kinda healing songs. They explain how many people feel. How they feel worthless, or how they feel like a messup. I highly reccomend it!
B003SHYVO8|5.0|My son and I both really love these dance movies. The are full of great dancing and they also have a great story line.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|ITi s OK but I was really disappointed. I chose it because the intro souonded interesting. I got bored with it soon after the first severel chapters.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|I really love to watch these mvies. Don't know what it is about the vampire movies that keep me coming back for more.

B006RBZV82|3.0|Yhis is some of the most beautiful and captivating underwater photography I've ever seen. It is information rich and quite educational about the aquatic life ecosystems. And it is edited at a nicely brisk, yet unhurrued pace.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and Kate WInslett, however, felt a bit wooden or perhaps uninterested in the material they were narrating. Or Perhaps they just needed a producer or recording engineer who could draw them out a bit more. Both are obviously capable~

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is a love story about a naive young women and a very abused young man that is a megalomaniac.  Lots of steamy, raunchy sex scenes.  If you are sensitive to such things then steer clear.  Otherwise, it's a great love story.

0812982622|5.0|It's been a very long time since a book captured me like this. At first, I was interested because it told the story of a North Korea I barely know. Then, I was caught up in the main character's life, to the point where I couldn't put it down. Finally, the writing and structure began to dawn on me. Every time I thought I had hold of what the author had done, something happened to make me re-visit my assumptions - as a writer and a human being.<br />The phrase \\"trauma narrative\\" is the author's own, and it does explain the style somewhat, but only initially. Toward the end of the book it began to dawn on me that what I was reading was not so much a narrative of traumatic events as told/remembered by the protagonist, but a landscape of memories, of a person, of a culture, of a nation.<br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.

B0038NN3B4|4.0|I am not prediabetic or overweight but  apply the knowledge in this book to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease.  I have not done my follow up lab work yet, but I feel great and think my immune system works better.  Definitely no more flatulence.  I know from a preliminary blood panel that my HDL shot way up even after only half integrating these concepts.  And I've noticed It takes effort to not lose weight if you are limiting carbs.  Some of the books and blogs on CVD and lipids get too technical for this layman.  This book was written by qualified authors who cite scientific research but keep it easy to understand. It feels strange when you start to implement this way of eating.  Ruling out bread and most fruits while sanctioning things like eggs and butter is easier when you have professors and doctors telling you it will be ok.  Try it and see how it works for you.

I think it could have been improved by making it shorter, but then would the historical aspects be damaged by the brevity?<br />My father flew  B-17's on 50 missions in 1943-44 and the details of those flights that he passed on to me give credence to &#34;A Higher Call.&#34;<br />Seeing those German fighters approaching struck fear in his heart.

B004ULEEY8|3.0|No one will ever accuse BATTLE: LOS ANGELES of being a good movie.  It has very little on its mind and accomplishes even less.  It's a simple story:  the world is under attack by aliens who have landed on the coastlines of major cities around the world and begun to lay waste to everything in their path.  Los Angeles is crumbling and the air force intends a HUGE airstrike on the city, in the hopes of laying waste to the aliens...and little of the city will be left standing.  A group of marines is sent in to rescue a small group of civilians who are holed up in a police station.  They have 3 hours to get in and back before the bombs start falling.  Things don't go smoothly.<br /><br />That's all you really need to know.  The movie is mostly a sequence of one war-like action sequence after another.  There is virtually no time for character development, except for some pretty lame sequences early on that let us learn about one thing about each of the marines we're going into combat with.  Aaron Eckhart is the \\"elder statesman\\"...a staff sergeant who has just turned in his retirement papers.  Eckhart is a good, stolid actor.  Very suitable for the role of a marine, and even though we know little about his character, we are okay with the persona that is Eckhart himself leading the film.  Other known faces pop up: the most successful is Michelle Rodriguez, who is always a bundle of energy and certainly convinces as a tough-as-nails soldier.  Bridget Moynihan and Michael Pena, on the other hand, are bland and their recognizable faces wasted.<br /><br />The special effects of the film are largely competent and the battle scenes are convincingly jarring.  This is a PG-13 movie, so although the cinematography is trying for SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (or even BLACKHAWK DOWN) cinema verite (what war movie hasn't tried to replicate RYAN?), the rating ensures there are no guts and little blood, even as combatants drop like flies.<br /><br />The most problematic parts of the movie are thequestionable military tactics.  This group of marines consistently makes decisions that seem little better than the decisions teenagers make in slasher movies.  There's just random running about.  This is not to say the marines don't act bravely...but the strategy of what they are doing is sketchy and doubtful.  Their moves lack precision.<br /><br />Then there is a scene about 2/3rds in that requires Eckhart to make a heartfelt speech about his time serving in Iraq and the men he \\"left behind\\" there.  It's meant to be stirring, no doubt, but I was embarrassed at the flat footed timing and the poorly written script.  There was no need for it, and the movie makes the huge mistake of thinking we've invested emotionally in the relationship between these characters.<br /><br />On the technical side, this is quite a competent movie, and thus, it earns a couple of stars for that.  Script and characters suffer a great deal.  In this case, the filmmakers should have gone with less talk, more action...because the creative team clearly didn't have the skills to write meaningful characters.  We want to see aliens and marines fight.  So cut 10 minutes of set up and let's get to the combat!  As BATTLE: LOS ANGELES stands, though, the best I can muster is a 2.5.  I'll round up to 3 because Eckhart and Rodriguez deliver the goods as best they can.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I did like the book, so mush I read it twice. Did not realize I had a hardback and had read it before.
B007X4ECLY|2.0|Literally the only reason to see LOCKOUT is to enjoy a loose, fun, devil-may-care performance from the usually more stoic and flat Guy Pearce.  He's always been a charismatic, interesting performer, but hasn't really built a reputation for lightness (LA CONFIDENTIAL, MEMENTO).  Yet in this predicatible, by-the-numbers film, Pearce manages to stretch himself in surprising ways.  This doesn't make the movie particularly worthwhile, not does it elevate Pearce to another level...but it was amusing.<br /><br />Pearce plays Snow, a government secret agent sort in the year 2079.  Somehow never fully explained, he's gotten cross-ways with some of his superiors and he's implicated in a murder he didn't commit.  He's sentenced to prison on the off-earth penitentiary, where prisoners are put into suspended animation for the duration of their sentences.<br /><br />Just before he's due to be incarcerated, the daughter of the President of the US, who is on a humanitarian visit to the penitentiary, is taken hostage when things go wrong and all 500 prisoners are released at one time.  Snow is given the opportunity to save her in exchange for charges against him being dropped.  So naturally he takes on this impossible assignment, going up against hordes of hardened criminals.  Even though I haven't seen this specific idea in just this way before...very little about the film feels new or surprising.<br /><br />Except Pearce.  His Snow is a smart-mouth.  Almost everything he says is a smart-aleck comment or a snide insult.  There's nothing serious about this man.  He's like an action hero stand-up comic.  It's not believable for an instant, but it is mildly amusing.  Seeing Pearce do it adds a dimension of fun.  But make no mistake...this mindlessly violent, uninspired film is not worth seeing.<br /><br />And just in case you think it MIGHT be worth seeing, I should note that there were some special effects in this film, in particular during an opening chase scene that are SO terrible, I was simply floored.  There is a motorcycle chase scene that Is no better than a half-rate cut scene in a video game.  No exaggeration.<br /><br />Maggie Grace plays the President's daughter competently, but she's generic.  All the villains are uninspired, and the \\"agency leaders\\" who run the operation from the ground (as it were) are utterly by the book of clich&eacute;d screen characters.  Thus, my modest expectations for LOCKOUT were not met.  Spend your free 90 minutes elsewhere., I was simply floored.

B00CMT54DA|5.0|MUD may be the best movie of 2013 through the end of April.  I was thoroughly entertained and captivated from the opening moments until the final shot.  The movie is so well crafted and acted.  It grapples with resonant themes.  This is a small movie that never feels small.  It's as gripping as any blockbuster thriller...yet is told on a small, personal level.<br /><br />It all starts with a great script by director Jeff Nichols (who also did the outstanding, but leisurely paced TAKE SHELTER).  Nichols is telling a coming-of-age story...and that's about as worn-out an idea as you can think of.  Yet even as portions of it feel as familiar as a Mark Twain novel...it's also never less than fresh and invigorating.  Nichols has packed his script full of serious themes, yet he never forgets to tell a good story.<br /><br />The story is set in Eastern Arkansas, right along the banks of the Mississippi.  In fact, our hero is Ellis, lives in a houseboat right on the water.  His parents (Sarah Paulson & Ray McKinnon) having a crumbling marriage, and Ellis is feeling uncertain about his place in the world and is worried about the seeming transience of love.  (And the livelihood his dad makes along the river is also endangered; and tied directly to the failing relationship of his parents.)<br /><br />One early morning, Ellis and his friend Neckbone (yep, that's the name) take a boat out to an island in the middle of the river.  They've heard that there's large boat STUCK UP A TREE.  The boat is there, and there's another surprise too.  Someone is living in it!  The boys meet Mud (Matthew McConaughey), the man on the boat.  He's hiding out on this island, waiting to meet up with his girlfriend Juniper (Reese Witherspoon) and avoiding the men who are trying to track him down and kill him.  This is over-simplifying the situation, but I don't want to spoil it.  Suffice it to say that Ellis is drawn to this strange but charismatic man...and offers to help him because he sees in Mud& Juniper another chance to prove the power of true love.<br /><br />This only skims the surface of the nuances at play in this movie.  Nichols the writer also touches on Ellis' first love.  He gives Neckbone a peculiar family relationship of his own, because Neckbone is an orphan who lives with his eccentric & magnetic uncle (Michael Shannon).  Even Mud has a peculiar father figure (Sam Shepard) that he has a complicated relationship with.  Thus, MUD is about boys and their fathers as much as it is about boys learning hard lessons about love.<br /><br />A lot happens in this movie, but not for one second is it complicated or difficult to follow.  Nichols the writer has laid his script out magnificently, and Nichols the director delivers a clear, almost old-fashioned movie.  The cinematography is gorgeous and the land (and river) become a character.  The acting is outstanding.  Characters don't always say what they're thinking, but all the performers show us on their faces what is going on in their hearts.  So many movies these days show blank-faced actors hiding their feelings.  MUD is old-fashioned in that the characters are clearly presented.  The script helps them, but each actor is given room to emote and feel.  This makes for a character drama that grabs hold of the viewer from the opening moments.  I found it to be a beautifully immersive experience.<br /><br />McConaughey is fantastic.  I've never been his biggest fan, but his Mud is fascinating, frustrating and compelling.  It's easy to see why Ellis is drawn to him.  And young Tye Sheridan (TREE OF LIFE), who is really our guide through the story, is remarkable.  McConaughey will get all the attention, but Sheridan is in the crucial role.  If we don't care deeply about Ellis, the film doesn't work.  And we care VERY deeply about Ellis.  I could almost feel the audience tangibly drawn to him and rooting for him.<br /><br />And everyone else is terrific too.  Shannon & Shepard are swell (is Shannon ever anything less than interesting?).  Ray McKinnon (SONS OF ANARCHY) is truly compelling as a man who is truly losing his grip on everything he's held dear.  Jacob Lofland plays Neckbone, and is the perfect partner to Sheridan.  These two boys have a deep friendship and we totally believe that these two kids WOULD be close friends...even as they have their differences.<br /><br />Even as I've sat here writing this review, my appreciation for the film has grown as I've tried to put into words just how and why it works so well.  I simply admired the movie from beginning to end.<br /><br />It's not perfect.  The female characters are generally unlikeable (even if well performed...Witherspoon is very much cast against type).  The climactic confrontation, terrifying as it is, seems a little like it's from another film.  But these minor flaws only stand out because the rest of the film is so fantastic.  It's been quite awhile since I've been able to recommend a film so whole-heartedly.  See MUD at your earliest opportunity!

Yes, you have to purchase the other two tables, but you'll have a whopping $4.97 in the game at that point, and it's so worth it.  Zen Studios, I don't know who the heck you are, but you have a new fan.  I'd play this if it were Care Bear Pinball, but Star Wars makes it even  more awesome.  Well made game.  Get it NOW!

I am sorry that I wasted time watching this.  I was hoping to have a few good laughs and relate to a movie about pregnancy while I go through my own, but the only humor I found was about the ridiculousness of this flick.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!

B008QE9VJI|3.0|I would like to have rated this lower as they went for comedy instead of adhering to the &#34;real&#34; DS, however, though I strongly hate that decision, I will review this movie on its merits,and,as a parody, or dark shadows comedy, it does &#34;work&#34;. While I believe that had they done this as a true Dark Shadows movie,the talent involved would have created a clamor among the public for more, they didn't, and neither does the film-going public therefore clamor for more. This movie is watchable and fun at times,and on that basis I can recommend it though I add to that how unfortunate that Mr. Burton and Mr. Depp really blew an excellent opportunity of reviving the franchise. These otherwise talented people really missed-the-mark here in that regard. Still, as stated,it has its moments and is worth viewing.

I watched the entire season in one day and was definitely left wanting more.
B00BJO5SXK|4.0|Tyler, The Creator is head of OFWGKTA, an alternative rap group from Los Angeles. Other members of the collective you may know include Earl Sweatshirt, Frank Ocean, Hodgy Beats, and Domo Genesis.<br /><br />This album is Tyler's third offering, after 2009's Bastard and 2011's Goblin. Bastard was our intro into Tyler's mind, and was my favorite out of the two. Goblin was good, but I felt like the poor production value and repetitive themes kept it from being a truly great album.<br /><br />Tyler, The Creator is known for his \\"shocking\\" lyrics and themes, but with Wolf, we see a tamer, more realistic Tyler. It's an interesting album for sure. Tyler explores fame, while still obviously bitter and angry at his father for abandoning him. It's certainly not a new theme, but it's explored in a new way. Tyler steps away from the purely shock-value lyrics. There are still tracks on the album for the stereotypical OF fans who love that type of music, such as Trashwang and Domo23. The production value on this album is vastly improved. Tyler is definitely evolving and improving in that department. Another appreciated addition to this album is the variation of styles. Every song has its own unique feel, and you don't feel like you're listening to the same thing over and over, like I did with Goblin. Compare, for example, Domo23, Treehome95, and Answer. All are vastly different tracks with their own unique merits.<br /><br />There, however, are two things that bother me about this album. First is Tyler's justifications for his homophobic lyrics and slurs. Hear me out. If he wants to use those slurs, or if he wants to rap homophobic lyrics, fine. It's his album, and he can do what he likes. It doesn't bother me, and it's his choice as an artist. But Tyler tries to say it's OK just because he has Frank Ocean and Syd Tha Kyd, both LGBT, on his album and group. By his logic, anyone who has a friend of another ethnicity should be able to go around and shout racial slurs. It's just a poor excuse, and it honestly seems to come off as more offensive than the lyrics themselves.<br /><br />Second, Tyler raps about not wanting to be associated with Yonkers and that era anymore. Yonkers was the song that arguably launched Tyler into fame. It had interestingly contradictory lyrics, he sounded absolutely insane (in the best kind of way), and the music video was just as ridiculous (again, in the best possible way). In the video, Tyler consumes a live cockroach. It seems that in many tracks, Tyler talks about that roach.<br /><br />\\"I ate one roach and I made a lot of money.\\"<br />\\"Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom.\\"<br />etc.<br /><br />Yet on Colossus, Tyler once again states his disdain for Yonkers nowadays (\\"Yonkers and Yonkers, sick of hearing about Yonkers\\"). If he no longer wishes to be associated with it, I think it is bizarre he focuses on talking about it so much.<br /><br />There are definitely some stand out tracks on this album.<br /><br />Answer is amazing. It's one of the most powerful songs we've heard from Tyler, lyrically speaking.<br />Rusty really shows how much Domo Genesis has grown as a rapper. His verse is engaging and he provides a perfect intro to Tyler's verse (which is super long, but worthwhile). Earl comes in the last verse and closes out a great song.<br />Slater and Jamba have some great beats, if you're looking into the production.<br /><br />All in all, Wolf is an enjoyable album, and arguably Tyler's best offering to date. If you haven't given him a chance yet, now would be a good time to do so. It's not perfect, and it has some low points, but it quickly redeems them for the most part.oor excuse, and it honestly seems to come off as more offensive than the lyrics themselves.<br /><br />Second, Tyler raps about not wanting to be associated with Yonkers and that era anymore.

If you haven't given him a chance yet, now would be a good time to do so. It's not perfect, and it has some low points, but it quickly redeems them for the most part.
B009GX69RK|5.0|The first couple episodes seemed a little off, falling into the unfortunate pattern of so many great first seasons. But things improved wonderfully!
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|As a personal rule, I try to listen to an album in its entirety before passing a final judgement.<br /><br />I just couldn't do it with this album. I skipped at least a few songs as little as 30 seconds in. I was hoping that after Lil Wayne's past few releases, he would really step it up and release something great. My wishes were not granted.<br /><br />The lyrics are generic and boring. The punchlines are groan-worthy. Production is OK. It seems that all Wayne is capable of rapping about today is skating and his favorite sexual acts. Truly, it becomes so boring that you feel nothing listening to the album. Lil Wayne never actually expresses any sort of interesting theme or thought on this album.<br /><br />I suppose that if I have to suggest any songs, I would choose \\"Rich as F***\\" and \\"Trippy\\", because they are the most tolerable.<br /><br />Listen to some older stuff if you want to explore Lil Wayne's catalog. This album is not worth the price or listen.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very successfully kept from being too quaint. The characters are all interesting and I care for  all of them. Can't wait to see the next season.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|Need to wake a sleeping machine yet....otherwise it looks easy to setup and access the machine from remote. Installation go smooth.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Reading this book reminded me of what it is like to walk on ice or play with fire. Simply exhilarating!
0452289963|5.0|I have a few of his books and love them. I bought this copy for a friend that is going through some things. I hope she gets as much out of as I did.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm not a mouse guy i fly flight simulators with a joy stick and rudder peddles and only use the mouse to navigate around the web.I have been using this mouse for about two week now and it does every thing i want it to do. I will be buying another one for my spare gaming computer. Anker has got it right on this one,and its very reasonably priced.
B000PFU7OO|3.0|If it wasn't for the music by Hansard and Irglova I would only give the film two stars. The film touched on the rise and fall of their romantic relationship, but fell a bit short in that area. Perhaps this was due to the couples desire for some level of privacy.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|Wonderful, delightful and vulnerable opening album for Daughter. Reminders me of Innocence Mission and that's a good thing. Driven by simple guitar and sweet demure vocals.  Very happy with the purchase!
B0088W7VNG|3.0|It all started with the film &#34;Stargate&#34;, which is on my list of top 25 Sci-Fi films. It was followed by Stargate SG-1, which was one of the best Sci-Fi series ever made. Stargate Atlantis continues in that tradition, but it doesn't quite live up to the predecessors. There are a few weaknesses in the cast and scripts, but there are some improvements with the technology associated with the lost City of Atlantis. It's still worth watching.
1476733953|5.0|Couldn't stop turning the pages. Enjoyed the story and was drawn to the characters. Can't wait to read more about these people! Appropriate for young adult/teen readers and adults alike.
B00B7IJBUY|2.0|This album from the band is too slow paced.  It 's an adult contemporary album, not a rock album.  Wish they would go back to their old style, before Jon felt the need to make a political statement with every song.  Sometimes you just need to have fun...
B000QRIGLC|3.0|Marcus Lutrell's SEAL team was on a mission to surreptitiously observe a human target in the Mountains of Afghanistan. Their mission is compromised - and later ambushed by enemy forces - when they're discovered by a goat herder and his son whom they decide to let live. The book focuses largely on Lutrell's efforts to stay alive and the simultaneous events unfolding back in his home town (Once it's discovered the mission has failed.). The book is about relying on ones' faith in his God, family, friends, brothers-in-arms and the kindness of strangers once will power alone, can no longer carry you through. Although SEAL training and tactics are not discussed at length, the extraordinary demands put on these men both during training and on the battlefield is. People of the Muslim faith are not monolithically depicted in this book.
B0079LJZG8|5.0|This movie was just big-spy fun. Gary Oldman is brilliant; the movie is well-directed and suspenseful. I definitely recommend it.
1932100660|4.0|This should be required reading for GPs and doctors in training. Yet it's very readable by a non-professional,<br />being well-written and managing to include data from medical studies in a way that can be understood by the amateur.<br />You'll see why conditions like diabetes, obesity, cancer and heart disease are &#34;diseases of affluence&#34;: this really attacks our materialistic & consumerist preconceptions of the &#34;good life&#34; -- in particular our compulsion to rate meat & dairy products as the best source of protein. Learn what nutritional studies REALLY say and prove. Learn what drives the world of food supply and medicine -- Money, Ego, Power and Control.<br />It's not light reading but by the time you've read it you will be convinced that you have the right and ability to make up your own mind. You'll start to recognise ways in which we are manipulated, and you'll know what topics to pursue to find out more.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Anyone who's got a passing interest in the British royals should know going in this film isn't entirely sympathetic to them--at least not throughout. I thought it did a good job of exploring their changing role, the public's expectations of them, Tony Blair's attempt to bring opposing views together, and the queen's genuine confusion over trying to adhere to &#34;the rules&#34; as she had brought up to follow them versus the surge of demand for something different when the princess died. Helen Mirren handled the role beautifully. And the Queen Mother was deliciously horrible. Warmly recommend it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Bought this for my nephew. He loves it. Has not conquered it yet but loves the challenge. Definitely recommend it for a much harder challenge
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This movie attempts to do too much, and isn't the least bit engaging for people who aren't well-versed followers of Tolkien's work. I kept having to ask for clarification as events unfolded. Probably if you love the book, and know it well, it's an enjoyable film. But for those of us who don't, I'd say pass.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I find the tray with the pieces in it too hard to see, and I keep opening another window and need to back space the page. I didn't think my fingers were all that big, but I guess I'm wrong in thin case.
B003F9E5D6|5.0|I show this in a 20th century humanities survey course.  It helps students better understand what the 'big deal' was about apartheid, the end of it and the importance of Nelson Mandela's leadership.  Even students who are only there to get the credit, learn something and are moved by the history.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|I HAVE HAD SO MUCH FUN PLAYING THIS GAME . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME  TO anyone who enjoys THIS sort of GAME.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Well written and well acted. It's a hard act to sustain.  Season 1 was probably better, but I will watch it as long as there are new episodes.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like playing this game but having to shell out pretty big bucks for timely progress sucked. It's just a game so up to $100 bucks for gems/bits is crazy.  Would have been 5 stars if more affordable.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Wonderful movie with a great story line.  A good family movie, especially for dads.  It is so refreshing to see movies being made that the whole family can watch without worry of inappropriate content.  Supplier was prompt and efficient.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This trilogy kept me turning pages faster than usual, and having to wait for the release of the third book was exquisite anticipation.  He writes deeply fleshed characters from his own life experiences in British Upper Society.  You won't want to just buy the first one, go ahead and get all three, so there is no delay in your desire to get to the next page.
0805092447|5.0|Great book to read to children.  They usually eventually learn the words on each page and wind up reading or reciting to you.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very very good game. It always has something new to look forward to when u play the game. Its good for all ages.
0064430170|5.0|This is one of my favorite children's books.  I enjoy having the child look for the mouse who moves around from page to page.  Children really enjoy this book as well.
B00BG4UWPC|5.0|Ever since Phoenix started making music roughly twenty years ago, they've been on a slow, but very steady upward trajectory.<br />Their sound has become more precise and joyous and I couldn't be happier. This new record is no exception. A perfect release for the spring and summer season. Listen to this music with friends in the sunshine or while driving down the highway in your convertible, if you've got one.
B00499NHLC|5.0|&#34;Sherlock&#34; revives Conan-Doyle's classic tales in unique and captivating characters and modern twists. Snug the collar on your mack close to follow Sherlock and John through chilling, deductive mazes of enemy plots to attain logical conclusions. You won't be disappointed!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Being an \\"older\\" adult male, I didn't have much interest in seeing this movie; the trailer made it seem like a kid's fantasy movie... I couldn't have been more wrong...wow! I was held captive watching this tale of the unlikeliest survivals at sea. The religious aspect in the mix didn't bother me whatsoever; everyone must believe in ...something....and I believe you should have a look at this beautifully crafted story.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|awesome CD for a great price. i am going to follow these guys for sure. The video for Radioactive is also awesome
140123755X|4.0|This particular 2012 edition collects issues 1-5, and also contains<br />-The text story \\"A Wolf in the Fold,\\"<br />-\\"The Price of a Happy Ending,\\"<br />-Preview for Volume 2 of \\"Fables\\"<br />-Preview for Volume 1 of \\"Fairest\\"<br /><br />The series: Fables is one of the best comic series currently being written.  (Okay, I'm only up to volume 10, I've got a lot of catching up to do!)  Long before a certain popular ABC TV series was a twinkle in anyone's eye, Bill Willingham started this tale of fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters who fled from their wartorn Homeland worlds to our mundane plane, attempting to escape an unknown Adverasy.  The (more or less) human Fables are living in a section of New York City they call Fabletown, unknown to the \\"mundys\\" (us).<br /><br />This volume: this book introduces the following characters:<br />Old King Cole: nominally the \\"mayor\\" of Fabletown, but in reality<br />Snow White: makes all the important decisions.<br />Rose Red: Snow White's less famous bad girl sister.<br />Bibgy: a.k.a the Big Bad Wolf.  Thanks to a spell, he's now (mostly) human.  Acts as Fabletown's sherriff.<br />Jack Horner (a.k.a. Jack the Giantkiller, a.k.a. Jack Be Nimble - every fairy tale/nursery rhyme character named Jack is this guy): This guy's so selfish, he demanded his own spin-off series.<br />Frau Totenkinder: The witch who tried to eat Hansel and Gretel (rumors of her death have been somewhat exaggerated).  Not so bad, once you get to know her.<br />Bluebeard: Formerly a pirate, now an honest businessman.<br />Prince Charming: Has been married to most of the female Fables, e.g. Snow White.  Currently single.<br />Also appearing: Beauty and the Beast, Boy Blue, \\"Flycatcher,\\" Cinderella and Pinocchio.<br />(More characters will be introduced as the series progresses.)<br /><br />The plot: Wow, that's a lot of blood!  Looks like Rose Red has been killed.  Who did it, and why?  Could it have been Jack?  Bluebeard? Someone else?  Bigby is on the case!<br /><br />4 stars because even though the series as a whole is excellent, this first volume is weaker by comparison.ase!<br /><br />4 stars because even though the series as a whole is excellent, this first volume is weaker by comparison.
B004T0XYKK|5.0|Having seen ths movie many times on TV I find it is even better in this format. A great Wayne movie
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I have been a fan of Green Arrow for many years. This show provides a new look at the Green Arrow within a modern setting.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Lincoln is a great movie; an instant classic. It gives real insight to the man behind the myth and legend. Daniel Day Lewis brings Lincoln to life, giving us an almost \\"behind the scenes\\" look into the heart, soul and mind of one of the truly greatest men in history.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This program brings new and entertaining ideas to an old stand by. Love how it has developed so far and hope it will continue for few years.
B008I43DYU|3.0|Nice basic calculator program but it comes with almost no instructions for use or settings.<br />Sometimes answers end up in exponential notation. It just doesn't work intuitively for me.<br />WE NEED HELP!
B0011XBLUS|5.0|This is the pinnacle of Sergio Leone's work. It is a must watch for all western fans. Make sure you have plenty of time to watch this long epic movie.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Adobe name speaks for itself. Why consider any other program for file viewing?<br />This should be everyone's go to app.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Thoroghly enjoyed the movie - great seeing Middle Earth again, and the shire.  Can't wait until the remaing movies are released.
B001EKP5FK|5.0|Love this set.  Even though I have seen them all before, they are very good movies.  They are kind of classic:  somewhat chick-flick but good stories for middle agers especially.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be. I enjoyed watching it so much. will watch again and again!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This is the 2nd time I've read it. I really like it, because you can picture it happened. It's funny sometimes, and sad sometimes too,but seams real how familys talk to each other. But he uses humor to talk about his life, in a matter of fact manor . I read it 10 years ago. I think was the better the 2nd time I read it. It's a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent doesn't even begin to describe it. The only reason I put it down is because I had to eat and sleep a little bit, at least.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Get this book you will absolutely love it and have a love for the other books please get the book
B00C5ZS5SC|4.0|Finally a full album from Mrs Ware. Been enjoying her on singles for awhile.  Great album to unwind to after work
0517163020|5.0|This book does not contain long winded dissertations or explanations. We have no distracting, no annotations, and foot notes; in fact nothing to distract us from the pure Shakespeare experience. This book naturally has all the advantages of a physical book of which I will not go in to. Among other advantaged this volume makes a great reference. Although if find myself reading for the fun and not just a reference.<br /><br />I do of course have individual copies of my favorites (some with pictures). I also have kindle versions for better or worse.<br /><br />Yet you cannot have too many versions and this is a keeper.<br /><br />Just a note each page has a vertical line down the center so it as like two pages. I am not sure the purpose or the advantage. And do not expect a lot of illustrations they are more like black and white pictured of old paintings.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|As a university teacher who is always  on the go, this app is essential to me. After purchasing the app, it was immediately sent to my Samsung Galaxy S III smart phone. Note, the free version has to be downloaded also...not a problem. You will just end up with 2 documents to go icons on a home page; delete one. I deleted the icon without the key pic.<br /><br />The app allows you to start or continue working on a word or power point or spreadsheet document. This is great!<br /><br />I am a satisfied  purchaser of the documents to go app and I recommend it.
B006LL0UZW|4.0|Let me clarify:  the narrative part of the book -- about 25% -- is beginner-friendly.  It describes some of the science and technology behind flash lighting without too many wonky words or ideas.  Then, however, the author puts you in a boat and sets you adrift.  Lots of lovely pictures with lighting diagrams and some of the technical details, but this left me with two questions:<br /><br />1.  What if I've never set up lights before?  Who's going to show me how to wrangle all those contraptions?<br /><br />2.  What if I want a style different from the author's, heavy on charcoal seamless and partially collapsed umbrellas?<br /><br />Maybe the answers to these two questions can be found elsewhere.  Don't look for them here.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|The main protagonist in this novel is Zoe who, in the beginning is married to Max.  Unfortunately, Zoe, who desperately wants children, has terrible fortune trying to bring a fetus to full term and either loses it to miscarriage or stillbirth.  In the couples endeavors to have a family they resort to IVF and after Max, disgusted at the troubles of conception, abandons the marriage, three of their frozen embryos become unused.<br /><br />After their separation Zoe meets and becomes friendly with her lesbian friend, Vanessa, while Max becomes involved with a homophobic cult and takes sides against his ex-wife as to the utilization of those unused embryos.  The issue finally goes to court to determine who should get them, Zoe's gay friend or Max's brother and sister-in-law.  A real cliffhanging, page-turner ensues. with a another great Picoult surprise ending.
B007ED9FIY|2.0|I watched this looking for the funny best movie of the year that I was told was in store for me. I didn't find it. Here's what I got instead.<br /><br />Characters I can't respect or identify with- Clooney is an out-of-touch wimp with no healthy boundaries. When his daughter tells him that his wife, who is in a coma, has cheated on him, he decides to share all his next steps with his daughter and her friend. I suppose that is why his kids don't respect him and curse in front of him. SPOILER ALERT: His wife's lover's wife comes to the hospital (flying from another island) to see his dying wife because her husband won't because he doesn't love her. Then she tells the dying woman that she forgives her. That is just not realistic. It's bizarre.<br /><br />Wasted location- There are LOTS of movies where the location is a huge part of the movie. It's like a silent supporting actor. This film looks as it it were set up that way, but fails to make that happen. I don't know if it is the way it was shot or what, but Hawaii never comes across as this pristine, romantic landscape worth saving. Since a big chunk of the plot revolves around that, it's a huge disappointment.<br /><br />Lack of cohesiveness- It looks like this was supposed to be a movie about a family drama, death, love, life, the continuation of life, and healing. Bubbles of those things pop up, but they never blend. They never gel. They are just elements instead of ingredients woven into the fabric of the story that create a cohesive picture. It's like telling a story by saying, \\"This and this, and then that and that. Get it?\\"<br /><br />There were funny moments that made my lips move to the side of my mouth, but nothing laugh-out-loud or even really smile cracking humor.<br /><br />It's not a complete waste. I didn't feel like I lost two hours of my life, but I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anyone else. It didn't entertain me, didn't make me reflect, and didn't teach me anything.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|I totally enjoyed my first journey through the trials and tribulations of David Sedaris' life.  His wit and writing style is a relaxing, entertaining and immensely fun way to read through the antics of a life that's not so different from our own but capitalizes on the humor a family uses to bind themselves together and to cherish one another.  Growing up in a large family with an intellectual father, a down-to-earth mother and a motley crew of siblings is far more writing material than some families experience in a lifetime, or is it?!<br /><br />As I read, laughing out loud at many bits of Sedaris' biographical humor, my European partner asked what was so funny.  Try explaining the U.S. slang used for typical, American family situations!  It doesn't translate well to &#34;outsiders&#34; but I was thoroughly entertained.  David's descriptions of living in Paris, as well as having to learn a new language, was also hilarious, since I had been in the same cultural-linguistic shoes, here in Europe.  Finally, I found someone to relate to, in one's mad quest to bridge national divides, in a foreign place.  But David could have been in boonies of a farflung, American county too.  His rendition of the experience is his writing gift.<br /><br />Sedaris' take on the wonderful, wry humor to be found in life's situations is refreshing, as his skilled authorship qualities.  Need a down-to-earth belly laugh about anything that life can throw at you, take up with David Sedaris for an hour or so.  Bet you can't read just one of his tales!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I am not sure I get all the hype and love of this show. As I have said before, I am probably the wrong audience. Really just a soap opera with fancy accents.

B00991TCOG|5.0|I instantly fell in love with her song &#34;Crystallize&#34; when I heard it on Pandora and I gave it the thumbs up on there.  Because of the thumbs up, Pandora played another song by her shortly there after and I loved that song too.  Then shortly after that it played another by her and, what do you know, it was great as well.  This got me to researching her and actively seeking her music out.  After hearing a few snippet of some other songs on this album I made the leap and bought my first album in four years which is saying something.  I was not disappointed.  IMHO, out of the twelve tracks on this album, she has one world beater, three great tracks I would still give five out of five stars to, two four star tracks, four that are good (three stars), and two  that are kinda &#34;eh&#34;.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is so fun and it pushes u to try to get a better score and more coins to buy boost and new people.
B00BLYFDO2|5.0|This is, in any universe other than our own, a six star record.  Iggy is amazing.  Nobody can condense the human condition into a couple-measure couplet like he can:  \\"I'm on file/with a reptile.\\"  Well, that pretty much covers our security state, doesn't it?  No need for a gaseous position paper.  You can glean wisdom like that throughout the whole record, and DD, while it is very, very funny, also has some smart shots at what we perceive as feminine beauty and, oh, this is sounding academic.  Just listen to it.<br /><br />This doesn't replicate the Stooges of a generation ago, and it shouldn't.  They aren't the same performers and we aren't the same listeners. (And the other writer is correct; critics of this never liked the Stooges in the first place.  They were writing glowing reviews of \\"Muskrat Love\\" for its \\"poetry\\" or some such.)  What this Stooge production does have is the intelligence.  This stuff has often been imitated, but never successfully copied, the mix of great riffs and, well, Iggy...never afraid to go reeling into quarter tones if it serves him, no AutoTune here, obviously, and crooning like a champion when that suits the bill.  It also has better guitar chops than you'll hear from the formula shredders, GIT sanctioned.<br /><br />In the end, though, all the above is beside the point.  It's a great Iggy record with a simpatico band that really gets him.  I saw one of their first gigs way, way back in the day...Wampler's Lake Pavilion, in Michigan...and I have never missed a single release since then.  Iggy sticks.  I cannot recommend this record too highly to anyone who cares about rock and roll.  Because it still matters, in some universes.

B000W0B0KM|5.0|This was the first Anthrax I have ever listened to, and I was hooked from the beginning. If you like fast thrash metal, then this should satisfy your need.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Previously I have never felt the need to own a James Bond movie. That all changed with Skyfall. When the critics said it was the best Bond of all, I thought sure, ok, whatever. As it turns out, I totally agree with them.

B000MD9UJC|3.0|I have several old Maglite flashlights, both AA and AAA types, which I hardly ever use, because their Krypton bulbs just don't produce very much light, when compared to my LED flashlights.<br /><br />Maglites have been around for decades, and while they are ruggedly constructed, the company has been rather slow to adopt LED technology, which has pretty much made incandescent flashlights obsolete.  Since Maglite has apparently been napping, Nite Ize, a company that specializes in producing a variety of accessories and gadgets, has jumped in, and developed a kit to upgrade older Maglites, by replacing the Krypton lamp, with an LED.<br /><br />The kit contains three major components, a base with the LED, a reflector, and a black screw-on end cap with a push button switch.  The conversion involves removing the old Krypton lamp and reflector, and replacing them with the new components.  Once the LED is installed, the flashlight will actually work without installing the provided push button switch, but many users may want the convenience of the switch.  When the switch is installed, the lamp housing in the front will still need to be turned \\"on\\" in the traditional way, for the LED to come on.<br /><br />Light output isn't that intense when compared to more powerful LED flashlights, but it certainly is an improvement over the feeble output of the original Krypton lamp.  Rotating the lamp housing, it is possible to adjust the beamspread in the customary way, however the range of adjustment is relatively slight, and you can't really get a tight beam with the LED.  I would prefer a light that is pure white in color, but unfortunately the LED produces a warmer color.<br /><br />The end cap with switch, is an improvement of the original Maglite design.  The switch isn't very smooth, and isn't rubber sealed, but it works well enough.  When carried in my pants pocket, the flashlight accidentally turned on a few times, so I eventually decided to go back to the original end cap, which has a carrying strap.<br /><br />As I have several unused Maglites, I bought this kit as a \\"trial\\".  It's pretty well designed, and the LED conversion works well enough, but as the refurbished Maglite is still inferior to many LED flashlights in the $10 price range, it makes more sense to buy a new LED flashlight, like the [[ASIN:B005E48K6I Ultra Fire 502B]], rather than spend $8 to convert an old anemic Maglite.<br /><br />Until the price of the conversion kit comes down, or Nite Ize provides a more powerful LED, I won't be buying another kit, especially when I'm paying for a switch that I don't even use.  Buying a new LED flashlight is probably a better option, but if you absolutely love your Maglite, this kit might be worth a buy.ich has a carrying strap.<br /><br />As I have several unused Maglites, I bought this kit as a \\"trial\\".

B001MCYZJC|5.0|I remember I had this album in vinyl. I accidentally left it out and low and behold, not what you think. the sun was hitting it directly and warped the disk. Aside from missing the old pop and click from the vinyl whis digital album was too good to pass up.

B0035Q4AFC|1.0|I am shock to see all the 5 star reviews given to this luke-warm nightmare movie. I am beginning to think I saw an entirely different Chaplin. Robert Downey, Jr. does not even come close to portraying Chaplin. Don't even get me started how Downey awkwardley protrays Chaplin as an old man( it was cringe-worthy)The make-up, I believe, was done by a 5th grader and his voice is all but a whisper.<br />Downey doesn't even fit the shoes as Chaplin when it comes time to show him at his glory days. He's wooden. His accent was that of a terrible \\"highschool actor\\" on opening night. The plot is snooze worthy. It drags on as it seems all other actors whisper their lines. It seems other boring Hollywood actors wormed their way in this film and Dan Akroyd is as annoying as he always is. Does he ever actually act instead of playing himself on film? Who's idea was it to cast this nightmare. His overbearing presence dominated scenes and all you could think about was how you still couldn't stand him (even Saturday Night Live he was terrible..yes, I said it)<br />Just because an actor \\"might\\" look like someone..doesn't mean they should play them. I don't believe Downey was \\"experience\\" enough to play Chaplin. He needed years of training and it showed as he flumbled during scenes.<br />I say: skip this movie. Watch Chaplins movies instead or read Chaplin's book. This movie is like drinking luke-warm tea. It's a disappointment from beginning to end.
B008602KQI|4.0|I always like the book better.  The casting was spot on.  Jennifer Lawrence is just awesome as Katniss.  Kudos to her.

B007N85POS|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire 8.9 and this game is absolutely gorgeous!  It is so much more fun than on a phone or a smaller device, or even on the PC.  If you like a challenge this is the game for you.  More challenging than the original Angry Birds once you get through the first few levels, I still haven't been able to defeat all the levels.

B00571F26Y|5.0|The information in this book is amazing and can change your life! (I has mine already!) The author, a cardiologist, sets the facts straight about how the wheat we eat today bears no resemblance to that of 50 years ago - and how it affects every organ in our bodies.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|Saves batteries, Adds convenience with an on/off button rather than turning the top, but you still have to turn the top to just the right angle for it to stay on.  without this upgrade you can adjust your light beam as desired, but with this upgrade, you get just one set light beam.
B002XISFGS|5.0|This film, in my opinion, was underrated when first released in 1979. Robert Wise did a wonderful job directing this film and the cast of the original series never looked better.
1847879071|5.0|This book helped me out a lot. I recommend this to anyone having to use SPSS.  Easy to read and comprehensive.
B0095P31L6|2.0|I waited for the film to pick up but had to let it go at about 45 min in and start looking for something to entertain me.  Not what I would recommend to anyone who loves many of the other animations out there; such as Despicable Me, Toy Story, The Incredibles, Monsters Inc., or The Croods.
0385349947|5.0|This is the best book ever written about the challenges and joys that come with being a female executive in the U.S. The writing was excellent and Sheryl Sandberg was incredibly honest and open about her experiences.

B002ZG997C|4.0|The Book of Eli(released Jan/10)is a work directed by the Hughes Brothers and stars,among others,Denzel Washington,Gary Oldman,Jennifer Beals,Tom Waits and Roddy McDowell.The movie is about a man on a mission,who doesn't stop until the job is done.<br />The story is set in a post apocalyptic world,where desolation,isolation and deprivation are the daily routine.Washington(Eli)with a keen sense of smell,taste and hearing,is \\"heading west\\"on a personal trek to get a copy of the King James Version of the Bible to the West coast.It is a book he reads religiously(no pun intended)every day.Not only are his senses keenly developed but his fighting skills match or out do even those.He has been on his walkabout for thirty years now and one wonders why he hasn't gotten to the west coast long before that.The story will tell us,but all in due time.<br />Eli has had to endure,among mnay other hardships,bandits along his journey and the movie starts out with one such ambush,which he \\"defuses\\" in quick order.He wanders into a derelict town run by Oldman.Oldman is a voracious reader but there is one book he wants to possess and that is what,unbeknownst to him,Eli carries.Oldman finds Eli is a man he needs to help run his town,but Eli is not interested.Oldman \\"invites\\" Eli to stay the night but Eli bolts before sunrise.A\\"companion\\" that is sent in to bed Eli goes nowhere,but the girl does indicate the next day that he carries the book matching the one Oldman wants.Oldman and the gang manage to catch him just as he is leaving and the ensuing shoot out still doesn't stop him,leaving Oldman wounded in the process.<br />Eli makes it to a house in the middle of nowhere where an older couple are holed up.Oldman of course wants that book.He pursues and catches up to Eli at the house.It is here that Eli's book and he part company,and Eli is shot in the stomach and left for dead.The\\"companion\\" goes after Eli and finds him some time later miraculously walking westward on the open highway.Together they finally make the west coast.In fact they reach San Fransisco and row out to Alcatraz.There there is a colony run by McDowell,who are preserving all audio,visual and written forms of communication pre-apocalypse.In cut scenes back and forth between Eli at Alcatraz and Oldman back in his town,we see the latter finally getting the book opened and seeing....nothing he can \\"read\\",because it is written in braille! In Alcatraz we see Eli sitting down with McDowell and dictating the entire Bible to him.Using old printing presses,a book is produced and carefully shelved among other pieces of religious material.As the film ends Eli has passed away and his companion is wearing some of his accoutrements as she heads back home.<br />The film is shot entirely in a washed out sepia tone and proves quite effective is setting a certain feeling and look throughout.While the premise is certainly interesting I found the going could get a little on the slow side at times,and the ending of the film especially got a little more drawn out than it should have.Remember we are dealing with a subject matter here that has been done over and over again,especially in the past few years,so I was personally looking for something special that would set this one apart from all the rest.I really didn't find much.However Washington does his usual good job in his role and he is ably assisted by the likes of Tom Waits,Oldman and McDowell in a small role near the end.Watch for Jennifer Beals in a surprise and nice role as Oldman's woman.Also for you Harry Potter fans,look closely at that old couple in the house...nuff said.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/a a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a deleted/alternate scene and a comic/cartoon about the back story to Oldman's charcater with the voices of Oldman and Washington.<br />All in all another in a long line of post apocalyptic films with a very good cast and some surprise cast members.But it is not original enough to set it apart/elevate it from all the others.Interesting story but only 3 1/2 stars.h to set it apart/elevate it from all the others.Interesting story but only 3 1/2 stars.
B0091Q3254|3.0|This review is for the first disk only, if the second one is anything like the first then I don't even know if I'll want to watch. It's a VERY artsy fartsy looking DVD. With the annoying little \\"old timey film\\" edits. You know, where the picture moves up and down horizontally til it \\"calms down\\", as well as the writing with the song title as if it's a rough edit. Plus every few songs or so, they interrupt the show to show Noel and co. out and about signing autographs and or looking at pyramids etc. I don't mind seeing that, so long as it's at the beginning of the show or even after. But during??? Way to break up the momentum of the show. Also, the song Supersonic (one of my fav. songs) is in black & white. Maybe it's just me but I've NEVER been to a live show and seen any of that stuff. Then the crowd shots, yeah what I want to see is the back of some random woman dancing in the bloody nose section, not even seeing the band. Is it really THAT hard to make a concert DVD? Get a camera, put it in front of the stage so you can see the entire band, and you leave it there. No edits. Leave the screw ups, the banter, everything in. That to me would be PERFECT. I guess that's too difficult to do with all this new technology. I'm sure glad I only paid $3 for this.
B005N4F48Q|5.0|I've watched this movie many times. The extended version makes the details of battle easier to follow. Much better than the regular version.

0307950689|5.0|Dan Brown is an awesome author! I've been hooked since I first discovered these Robert Langdon adventures. Combining fact with fiction I can't get enough! Love the concept of the Sacred Feminine!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The acting in this film is superb. The characters are believable in all their eccentricity, and the story holds strong from beginning to end. David O. Russell has managed to deal with a very serious topic in a heartfelt, comic way. I love this movie.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|I never saw this movie when it came out because it was so hyped. Recently, I became interested in French New Wave, and started thinking of other French films I hadn't seen yet. Watching &#34;Amelie&#34; was a joyful experience. The friendship between Amelie and Mr. Dufayel is one of the most poignant I've ever seen in a film. He's supportive when he needs to be, yet he also knows when to nudge her towards self awareness. Sure, there are fantastical elements and a fairy-tale vibe, true. Some of the criticism thrown at this film was for valid reasons (not enough diversity). But, what it truly is for me, is a story about an introverted, lonely woman who learns to help others and take her place in the world.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have no tips or guidelines - it does what it is suppose to do and very well indeed - I think
B001DM1VXE|3.0|The story wasn't interesting enough to hold my attention for long. Rather dull to tell the truth, honestly. Too slow

B009X01FJS|5.0|I LOVE this case! It revolves to stand vertically or horizontally (3 settings each) for hands free reading. Has a 'pocket' to hold it when you're not using the stand. Best thing I could have purchased for my new Kindle. And I received it in 2 days. The hot pink looks amazing, too!

0385344228|5.0|I read many thriller/ family drama books, and defending Jacob is one of the best.<br />it's the kind of book that makes you think.. It keeps your mind busy all the time. It makes you so attached to the story that you'd be thinking about it - even when not reading. For me it felt, as if I am watching a great movie, that makes you create this special bond with all its characters.<br /><br />The story talks about a family of 3, and how far would a father go to help his son and to keep him out of prison.<br />The crime itself/ the case is an interesting one. A 14 year old boy was stabbed 3 times and died. A prosecutor father finds himself torn between the nature of his job and the fact that his son was convicted.<br />The father keeps unconsciously hiding evidence and finding justifications for his actions.<br />He keeps ignoring all the doubts related to his son innocence.<br />The father was closing his eyes and ears in order to protect their 'normal' family image.<br /><br />I also like the scientific - biological part of the book.. The part where it talks about the DNA_ criminal - murder gene.The way it links it to the X chromosome and the serotonin transporter system. Explaining that 'the structure of DNA was only discovered in 1953... We are just beginning to look at what we are. Not as some abstraction like the 'soul' or metaphor like the 'human heart', but the real machines of human beings, the nuts and bolts.'<br /><br />It also highlights the fact that kids are different these days.. with parents who are busy with work, teenagers tend to life a shattered/ private life. Parents often find themselves oblivious and they get to know more about their own kids through their friends and facebook accounts.<br /><br />I found some parts so enjoyable to read.. and had to pause a bit when reading them:<br />-'The doctor described it as 'jacob's heart being two sizes too small.' And his emotional maturity being not at the same level as his peers - with characteristics of a boy half his age.<br /><br />-\\"Every father knows the disconcerting moment when you see your child as a weird, distorted double of yourself. It is as if for a moment your identities overlap. You see an idea, a conception of your boyish inner self, stand right up infront of you, made real and flesh. He is you and not you, familiar and strange. He is you restarted, rewound; at the same time he is as foreign and unknowable as any other person. In the push/ pull of this confusion, with me arm on the back of his chair, I touched his shoulder.''<br /><br />The only thing that I found a little bit annoying about this book is that some parts get to be repetitive. The first 300 pages are slow.. and most of the story is concentrated towards the last twenty pages! I found the ending shocking and disturbing and thought that the book would be great if the ending was longer in description rather than shrinked!<br /><br />Dimaa boy half his age.<br /><br />-\\"Every father knows the disconcerting moment when you see your child as a weird, distorted double of yourself.

B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love it and Blake Shelton, The whole CD is awesome,. I would highly recommend it to all of you country fans
B00AH6CYRO|4.0|DM returns to a more classic sound for Metallica fans, after the disorganized and sometimes chaotic mess that was St. Anger and the utter disaster that was Lulu. The album sounds like a modern-day And Justice For All, with blitzing riffs and breakneck speed with a telltale Rick Rubin influence. Back as well (and in my opinion the most welcome and necessary aspect) are Kirk Hammett's solos, which were virtually non-existent in Anger. Death Magnetic is not a radio-friendly album, with most songs stretching beyond the 5-minute mark, again recalling the listener to the days where a good album was more important than a hit single. Overall Death Magnetic delivers on the need for an old Metallica style and hopefully is a harbinger of things to come.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. I would suggest this game to all if my friends if I could,of which I will.

B003VR5PPY|5.0|Seriously the most intriguing rpg game I've ever played. This is the 1st game I've come across that you get different endings by the choices you make. Awesome game because you want to keep replaying until you complete all of the various endings. Addictive game with a greta storyline.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|For $20 it's amazing. It fits my kindle securely and it does what it said it would do. I love the revolving face and the placements are secure. Yes just like any other covers when dropped it may pop the kindle out but that's with any cover. It's great for watching movies and typing out emails AND reading your favorite books. I highly recommend this product for people who use their kindle daily. It doesn't have a pen slot but the usb slot is easy access.<br />(P.s. on the products website it's over $40 so this is a great steal)<br />Enjoy!

B00BEZTMFY|2.0|As sad as it is, I must say that this movie doesn't measure up to expectations. What worked for the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy doesn't work well here. \\"The Hobbit\\" is not an epic saga; it is a more straightforward adventure story, and a short book, at that. It isn't all dismal, bleak, and gray. It's supposed to be energetic and exciting and funny. (On that note, Martin Freeman is an excellent choice to play the young Bilbo Baggins.) But the movie is at all times dark and ominous, like LotR.<br /><br />It's quite sad to say that I didn't enjoy it. I would rate myself among the most enthusiastic of Tolkien fans. I just think that the \\"LotR approach\\" was the wrong one to apply to this movie.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Another classic Rebus mystery, with the retired Rebus just as feisty as ever.  Very glad to see Rebus back and like the interweaving of Rebus with both classic and newer characters from earlier books.  A good read, as always.
B001QWBM62|4.0|There are enough reviews about this product's capabilities and sound quality.<br /><br />Capabilities and sound quality are great.  Period.<br /><br />The first week I got the H4N a miniscule piece of plastic broke off of the battery cover. (See photos) Now, my 5 day old recorder is held closed with a piece of tape. Others have this issue too. Support seems to be lacking.  I sent my first email today and will start with the phone calls on Monday.<br /><br />The flap that covers the SD card slot is also very frail and is already showing signs of wear. (Opened 15 times at the maximum). I imagine the chance of the cover failing is probably 100%.<br /><br />I keep a roll of electrical tape with the H4N in order to keep the battery cover closed.  Kind of lame.<br /><br />I would not trade it for the world. But I'm very disappointed that in the first week with very careful handling, it's already breaking up.
B000001DU5|5.0|The best CD ever.  This is the second one I've had to buy I play it so much I wear out the disc.  This is a must purchase if you like Tears for Fears
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I was hooked from the moment I started reading \\"Time Killer.\\" The way the author, Todd Thiede, describes things in this book allowed me to clearly visualize what was happening in the story. Todd has a very special talent in writing to activate the reader's five senses. This is an excellent thriller, with many twists and surprises along the way. I highly recommend this story for anyone who loves reading books that are easy to follow along with, but have mind blowing, mysterious surprises hidden within. Honestly, every time I opened the book to read, I wanted to press onward until the end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The beautiful and dramatic portrayal of life in the early 20th century England is both fascinating and compelling.  This season focuses a considerable amount on World War I, so it has a stark sense both in the characters experiences and, oftentimes setting.  Even Downton Abbey the home adapts; its character and those inside its walls have been altered.  The final episode in its final minutes takes place outside the home, snow falls, blanketing the surroundings in a clean white canopy.  The symbolism and enduring sense of hope and love in the final scene make the show and its characters my favorite of all the Downton Abbey season episodes.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am finding this book life changing. Even if you only take one thing from your read, it will be invaluable! I highly recommend it for all women, and the men in their lives

B0061S073A|2.0|4 and 6 year old got though in a matter of days on a xoom and kindle fire HD<br />What good is it?
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I thought the new movie was great and will probly see it a few more times while it's in theaters. One thing I've been looking for, is a video game tie in too the movie. I see there is one for ipods, but nothing for PS3 or Wii, You'd think with how great the movies have been, I still have the first 2 video games, they would of made one based on Iron Man 3. Still a great movie overall.
B007SAP7S0|5.0|You pretty much have to get this if you're a true Lenny fan.  All the demos and alternate versions are amazing.  Loved it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is for people who love to read and those that occasionally read. I got the Omnibus edition because it has all the short novels rolled into one full length novel. I must say that it is worth the money and then some. I have already read the Shift Omnibus as well, and it is amazing as well. Can't wait for the next book, or omnibus edition.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I'm sorry, but I'm not like a super music critic who is going to be able to give you this in-depth, track by track review.  All I can tell you is this:<br /><br />This album is worth the hype.<br />This album is everything I needed.<br />This album is the natural progression and evolution of the David Bowie style.<br /><br />I played it from beginning to end many times during the first week I owned it.  It was just that awesome.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wanted something as good as Dune.  That's a tall order, as I have read Dune 3 times and each time it's left me euphoric for weeks.<br /><br />I googled &#34;Science Fiction sci-fi as good as Dune&#34; on a lark.<br /><br />This book is what came up.  I read about the story of the triumph of the self-publisher.  I read the reviews &#34;up there with Heinlein, Herbert, Asimov&#34;.  Really.<br /><br />Downloaded it, and in one chapter i knew i was in the hands of a master.<br /><br />I can't say enough, and evidently, neither can the rest of us.  SImply the best.<br /><br />what a good book!
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Wow! What can I say...its AWESOME!  Having grown up and being a fan of Cinderella, Poison, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Black Crows, etc.  Besides Bon Jovi no one has come close to delivering the goods.  Until now.  Tom Keifer, front man and lead singer/song writer of Cinderella absolutely nails it with his solo CD.  Put this in your player and crank it up.... I can't stop listening to it...Simply put it Rocks!<br /><br />From slow or ballads to bluesy Rock there is not a better sounding or better written more complete CD out there.  You will want to buy this CD or Download the MP3s and you will not be disappointed.
B00009P1MP|5.0|I purchased this after watching a PBS special on this musician and I totally love the sound. I like folk music and this fits the description.
B00BW5K5DO|2.0|this game is so much fun. you will find yourself trying to beat the clock over and over again. all of the playrix games are slot of fun.
B007CKNX28|4.0|This is the first time I have purchased this artist after hearing his band play on Steven Colbert. I like the music and like his style. I am learning that I love music of all types of genres.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Some of the most unique music I've ever heard. Passionte and beautiful. This album is a must buy by any one who considers themselves with the times. Like nothing I've ever heard before this music is wonderful.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I have another Hangman game that is pretty boring, and the letters you choose from do not fit on the 8 inch tablet screen, but this one is funny.  The game itself is EXACTLY the game you remember, but as you miss letters and build the hangman there are little animations to entertain. Loses one star because you cannot &#34;save&#34; your game and score to finish later, and you cannot enter your name on the leader board.  Fix these minor things and it will be 5 stars all the way!!
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Wow! What a great re imagining of Cinderella. Just amazing. The story flows so well and really grabs you from page 1. I've already told my sister to read this book and I will tell many more. Doesn't matter your age this book is classic!!!!!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie lacks all the things that make American movies so American, like crudeness and unnecessary conflict.  It's a great story about the lives of interesting people, and... well, it's awesome.  :)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun and entertaining and great grafics. My kids will like it. I like it. It works well. It's pretty. The end.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Love the movie and having it at home in 3d is the best. Great quality and movie if you didnt like the way it was filmed in the theaters then this is for you. It doesnt have the reality mode like the theaters did, just has the normal 3d mode you are used to at home.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|James Dashner writes another amazing book. I am very impressed with this as well as the series. A fantastic prequel.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Our daughter loves it.  She plays it all the time.  It keeps her occupied and she loves trying to win.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|it just freezes every time I log on. it just waits random words. its a hood game but tats annoying.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read every book from this author and have enjoyed all of them.  This story had many parts that all came together in the end with an added surprising twist.  Loved it!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I can't wait for access to season 4...everything is great about it, the writers, actors, script and intensity are all first class. Thanks for bringing interesting drama to us!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Amazing story of finding your own truth. Cheryl takes the reader along for the journey with descriptive writing of the visual and emotional encounters along the PCT.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this is a great free game,  good graphics with two different control methods it stays challenging. it can get a bit repeatative
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|We love Orphan Black. Sci Fi but not over the top. Action and adventure. New and creative story line. The main character is so great she's super talented, flawless. On the edge of our seats!
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Me and my son loved this movie. The quality of the streaming beats Netflix by far! Definitely recommend this. Just wish they had more titles available for Prime members.
B004EWFV9K|4.0|This was a very satisfactory story. True to character, as ever, Wallander is morose and reflective as he chases the truth behind the disappearance of an elderly couple. I enjoyed this book very much. It is well written with interesting characters and places. I have only read a few of the Wallander series, but I will probably go back and order more as I try to get into the head of this interesting police detective.
184448551X|4.0|I absolutely love this book so easy to follow, well illustrated and many projects to make. Am really looking forward to start stitching from this book.
B000GCFO08|5.0|this was the first time i saw the movie--very creepy and well done----the disc and packaging were in perfect shape--it also got here in no time whatsoever
1439153663|4.0|This is a good read for anyone who wants a truthful look at a slice of American history.  It offers a quick and easy read with despicable, loyal and hopeful characters.  Its enticing plot is intertwined with empathetic circumstances of hope, betrayal, kindness and evil.  It offers a good look at the inter-connectedness of all human beings, regardless of color, race or ethnicity.
0670026603|5.0|I read a lot and there are very few books that are so beautifully written that capture my absolute attention. I couldn't put this book down.  I feel sad now that I'm done and miss the characters. A gorgeous story that felt real. I was enthralled.
B000UAFDP2|1.0|The BD will not play on my Blu-ray player.  The original would not play nor would the replacement you promptly sent me for which I am grateful.  I even purchased a new Blu-ray player for the replacement copy you sent me but it still wouldn't play.  I don't hate the movie, but since it doesn't work, I have to give it the lowest rating possible.
B000HSKUBE|5.0|I had this series recommended to me by a coworker, citing it as the basis for the new US version. In this series, you'll found yourself rooting for the most unlikely of protagonists, Francis Urquhart, an initially unremarkable politician that decides he's had enough,with a little prompting, and embarks on a journey of scorched earth revenge and megalomania in the British Parliament.<br /><br />If you've ever felt like someone has given you the short end of a deal, or slighted you in any way, you'll find yourself rooting for the leading man, and feeling guilty admiration for the comeuppance doled out.
B007MCTTHY|2.0|I got this on a recommendation from a friend.  After opening it, I was certain I must have made a mistake in the name and chosen the wrong game.  If you are an adult, you should bypass this game. If however, you have children between the ages of 5 and 13, you might want to consider it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love this game. The puzzles are just challenging enough without being frustrating. I can't wait for the next one.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|For anyone hooked on the TV series, this is a great purchase and if you are new to the stories having the first four in one bundle is a must!  Once I started reading I couldn't stop so being able to just go from one book to the next without interruption is great!  Each book is filled with intrigue, romance, battles, wit, chivalry, honor and deceit!  And Dragons!  Definitely as good as if not better than the Tales of King Arthur!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|a great app for keepng up with family and friends.  once in a while will get some crazy stuff but on the whole enjoy very much
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great characters, writing, direction and acting!  If all the seasons are this good, I'm very happy to use Prime membership and get series like the Sheild without ads.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My wife loves this musical and has seen it on stage quite a few times, so the movie was a must for her birthday.<br />It was a good price; it arrived on time, and it was easy to order, what could mae it better?
B009YP9L7U|1.0|This book is not exactly what I expected.great story line Bigger plot, meeting the family....baby. just expected more that's all!
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I think these guys are great, I've seen them in concert & can't wait to see them see them again.
B005COO1X6|5.0|How can you give Stevie anything less then a five star review. I mean he is the father of the spooky, hair standing on end, bladder weakening, spinkter tightening traditional creepy story.  If you don't like creepy then read John Steinbeck for Christ sake.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|This is a great movie.Tim and Gwyneth awesome together,I would tell all my friends to rent this movie even if they r not Country music fans.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|The movie is very hilarious with Gargamel stealing the show for me: I enjoyed every moment of the movie from start to finish. I am really looking forward to the movie and the Scottish smurf.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|I believe what he has told us in this book. Great reading even if you dont believe. Must read you will enjoy
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|Dosnt load worth carp right when I down loaded it it wouldn't play the game an  it take  up a ton of room when it doesn't even work overall it sucks
B00932A4XE|4.0|My husband and I got a lot of laughs out of this movie! We loved the cast and was pleasantly surprised by Brooklyn Decker's performance. Thought it was super cute!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|After watching a quick trailer, my wife and I decided that this movie would be something we would enjoy.  Finding movies without nudity in them is important to us so a quick check on other web sites informed us that this movie does have a couple of scenes containing nudity (although very brief and not sexual in nature).  We figured it was worth the risk.  It doesn't take long for the action ensue!  The devastation of the Tsunami that strikes the coast of Thailand is portrayed in excellent detail.  How the Producers and Directors were able to film this type of carnage is beyond my imagination!!  Once the wave strikes and you're following the struggle of Maria and one of her three sons, it would be easy to believe that the actors were being filmed under actual circumstances!  The magnitude of what was captured on film here is sure to be awe inspiring!  The rest of the movie is just as engrossing.  The struggle and desperation of each family members fight to survive and the strife of those they encounter is portrayed excellently.  Naomi Watts' performance is second to none and so is Ewan McGregor's!  The children in this film give a very believable performance as well.  This is a movie you are not going to want to turn you eyes away from and to think that the events that take place in this film are based on a true story make it that much more enjoyable.  I highly recommend this film!!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Entertaining - the characters interact beautifully - they have flaws, yet seem to make the best of any given situation - would recommend this show!!
B00124HT8O|4.0|Loved the original LP.  Found a few of the 'extra' tracks annoying.  In hindsight would not have bought those.  Original play list was MUCH better.
B0086700CM|5.0|Better than Temple Run 2.  (That game makes my eyes go loopy.)  Fast paced, straightforward and addictive.  Great to bust out a couple runs during a short work break.<br /><br />Nothing to complain about with this game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good series, if you liked the movie you'll love the book. Definitely a must read for people interested in action books.
B006PAZMMK|4.0|As good as First of the Year Equinox album?  Mmm......I dunno.  Bangarang is still pretty damn tight though.  Skrill did his work on this and it shows.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My grandchildren loved watching it.  They liked it so much I think Nana may have to purchase for their visits.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Great concept.  Fun to play.  Doesn't eat up all your time when you just want to fiddle around.  I like the physics and engineering concepts with regards to structure strength.<br /><br />This is a very good game.<br /><br />Con:  Needs me logged into Amazon Marketplace to play........why?  I paid for this.  Negative 1-star for a game that should be 5 stars.
B00785P2QC|4.0|You can get along without spending real cash, but it does take a while to build up in game cash.<br /><br />Overall it's pretty good.
B0062QRTKA|4.0|Straight forward.  Part the sea to save your people.  Virtually no thinking involved.  Pretty funny game to be honest.  Will it hold your attention?  Depends on the type of game you like.  Animation are pretty funny too.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I've played most of the fb games and took a hiatus for a couple of years. Then purchased a kindle and discovered similar games and have tried almost all of the TeamLava games. I've since stopped playing the others but Dragon Story is one I can not give up.<br /><br />Customer service is really great! I had to transfer my game from one kindle to another and they helped me in a timely fashion. Though I wish there was a way to transfer game data yourself, like how you can with the iPad. My only complaint, when my game transferred I now have some glitches which are somewhat annoying but bearable for now.
B008BIN9EW|2.0|It is what it is.  Turn based.  Seems like enemies are a bit over-powered.  You may get stuck early on.  Money generation is huge in this game and can be a game breaker.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I like this game.  A good way to pass the time and relax.  It does get a little monotonous though.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game I also have it on my phone. Wish I could combine them. Its easy but kills time when you are bord and waiting on something.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a cute game for kids and adults alike. I am playing it with my six year old and we're both having a blast. The graphics are lovely, music is not too annoying. The only complaint is sometimes it is slow to connect to the server.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|I thought this movie of a couple struggling to survive with kids while turning 40 was hysterical!  I laughed throughout the entire movie and have recommended it to all my friends.  I am 43 with 3 kids though, so I get the humor.  Some of it is dark humor, but overall it is a really funny glimpse into daily life with kids.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|For not only a musician, but a humanitarian who has one of the largest impacts on people in the twentieth century, Marley, does a great job of telling Bob Marley's life story. It is beautifully written with not only the soundtrack being perfect but the interviews and story telling really putting you in Jamaica and understanding what this man's influence really was. Great documentary. If you're interested about Bob Marley, this is the one you want to watch. TWO THUMBS UP.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|One of my main sites to visit whether at home or on the road. I keep in touch with friends and issues.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|No issues at all with the connection. I use it with VNC so I can't say much about the RDP connection but it's nice that the feature is there in case. The controls are intuitive and it works with my Swype keyboard.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I'm a big Follett fan; his history based fiction always makes for good reading. In this offering, however, I found the family relationships of the principal characters stretched credulity. Having said this, the good guy/bad guy theme was certainly imaginative. My respect for Follett has not been diminished
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I like to read something thoughtful  and this did the trick......<br />I am trying to find Christina Mc Kennas' other book but no luck.
0547258305|5.0|I found the main character deep and strong. She had to make some tough decisions in this book. I liked the way she made the choices she made. So many books have the main character making poor decisions just to move the story along, but in Graceling the story created the options. The story moved along at a good pace and kept me wondering what would happen next. I will be  reading the other books in this series soon.
B00008J2PG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I enjoy true stories, that have truth yet no swearing or vulgar language, and no sex.  There was enough excitment to keep me engaged through the whole movie.  It was interesting to see what was happening in countries where the Natzies where taking over and the simularities of what is happening with our country and government today.
B008SGMPVU|5.0|The new star, what are you going to name it?  Dark Star very well may be the greatest science fiction film you have never seen. It also might be the greatest science fiction film. It really depends on how you look at it. One must consider the following: when it was made (1974 - before Star Wars), the budget (reportedly a mere $60,000) the director (John Carpenter - first film), and how long it has maintained relevancy. Dark Star still trumps million dollar blockbusters coming out today. Add this up and this film should be awarded its rightful place in the science fiction film hall of fame. Dark Star is vintage, raw, and awesome John Carpenter. This film is actually kind of an intergalactic road movie. Dark Star is the name of a space ship that is inhabited by a team of rugged astronauts. The crews mission is to nuke planets in the star system ready for human colonization.  They are basically laying the way for humans to move into outer space. It's a pretty original concept that really hasn't been used many times. Star Trek this is not. Star Wars this most certainly is not. This is Dark Star. A very unique take on the deep space concept.  Throughout the mission the crew experiences a wide array of challenges ranging from comical to philosophical. If you enjoying thinking while you laugh this is probably for you.  Imaginative scenarios include defiant beach ball aliens, toilet paper shortages, and celestial surfing.  Dark Star really set the tone for silly Comedy Central style humor. If for nothing else, watch this film for the creative low budget aesthetic. For those that appreciate creativity in film, Dark Star is really inspiring. It's also important to note that the special effects were done by Dan O'Bannon. This is notable because he went on to work as an effects technician on Star Wars, Alien, and he also Total Recall.  The haunting score by Carpenter is also a winner. Dark Star really laid the foundation for many science fiction films and still influences the direction of the genre today.irection of the genre today.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|For any DM lover this is great only one song dont really like, the more you listen them you like.
B008Y6RGFE|5.0|Very enjoyable and entertaining I thoroughly enjoyed some of the truths he revealed and the way he revealed the in the movie.  I had used several of his &#34;techniques&#34; 30 yrsago...but they are just basic common sense advice on how to successfully date a lady

B00CL68NOG|1.0|Streisand was okay but Rogan stunk and I dont think it was his fault but the fault of the script writers
B004LROUNG|4.0|The story line is interesting, the characters are believable and the plot keeps a steady pace. It is very nice book.
B001G70M6S|2.0|First photo out of this package work magic. After that the rest of the images did not show. the environment didn't change or the settings and every single photo came out blank. very disappointed
B002N1AEN2|5.0|I happened on to XX on Pandora loved the Sound had to get the album to check it out.  I am really glad I did.  Love the beat the sound the voices.  Get this Cd you wont be sorry you did
0525425764|3.0|I have read all of the Grisham books and unfortunately found this to be a bit juvenile almost like the old &#34;Spin and Marty&#34; tales of years ago. I will however continue to purchase Grishams books as he is still in my eyes a great story teller!
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|What can I say &#34;Classic&#34; must have in any classic rock library.  Awesome work.  They don't make music like that any more.<br />pink Floyd in Class of their own this album also stands alone.
0385535147|5.0|Quick moving, good plot very enjoyable. It kept my interest as all of Grisham's books do and I finished it in two days.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Excellent Album.  If you are looking for a mix of some of the Great  Pink Floyd works.  It has  all of my favorite Pink Floyd songs. So If looking for good Starter Intro to Pink Floyd this is excellent
B00CBRADU2|5.0|Good job Arnie, still the man,  making hits,  will watch it again, and own this movie.<br /><br />Hope Arnie comes out with more action flicks, no one better.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought these to replace my Turtle Beach XP 500s.<br /><br />I primarily use these for PC gaming.  I replaced my XP500s because the wireless transmitter was an absolute joke - I would have times when the audio would completely cut out for minutes at a time.<br /><br />However, the 500s had a dedicated audio processor.  The sound quality that came out of them was MUCH higher and had a more full and encompassing sound.  The 930 is fairly good at the surround sound, however it doesn't like game distances.  It's also much more accurate in telling you WHERE sounds are coming from, but it doesn't blend into different zones as well.<br /><br />But the 930s have EXCELLENT software and ease of use and access - the 500s feel like they just shoved buttons and recessed dials in places.<br /><br />All in all, I think I'm putting the turtle beaches away in favor of these - I'd rather have a slightly less well performing product that works all the time than one that cuts out.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Simple game play with enough variety to keep it interesting. You can easily lose track of a lot time while playing.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I never was a able to use this app, it asked for my Amazon email and password, which is the SAME one i used to type this email and it wouldn't accept it. I tried to contact Amazon but they sent me back an email telling me to email this other department, so i gave up, I've got better things to do. I will however, take time to tell other people the trouble I had, and hopefully they have better luck!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Find myself checking daily and so far the information has been right on and helpful. No need to check multiple sources when you find a source that works! Also on my iPhone...
B007Y36K46|4.0|First off, I have not read the Barsoom books, so I can't say whether or not this was a good adaptation. I can say that it was a fun adventure movie.<br /><br />The characters are likable, particularly the strong and beautiful princess, Dejah Thoris, who is definitely not a damsel in distress; she wields a sword and knows how to use it.  I also was very impressed with the Thark alien race, who have a unique appearance and distinct culture, but despite them looking and sounding similar, there's just enough nuance to see the personalities of the key characters, especially Tars Tarkas and Sola.  As for John Carter himself, he is likable and unlike a lot of reluctant heroes who quickly change their tune after meeting the pretty woman, it takes John a while to decide to fight alongside the Tharks to save Dejah and Helium.<br /><br />Having recently vacationed in Utah, it was great to see that scenes in this film were filmed there, because the state is very unique and has a natural beauty you won't find anywhere else.  The way Mars is portrayed is unique; the alien races, fauna, and flora are unlike what I have seen in other media.  I particularly liked the dog-like pet of Sola who takes a liking to John.<br /><br />One complaint I have is that we don't learn enough about the villains of the movie. I would have liked to know more about Sab Than, Matai Shang and the Therns and what was motivating them.  Still, the lack of development of the villains is nothing new to this genre.<br /><br />I don't understand why this film received a negative response; in my opinion, the story was fun, the film looked good, and it was family-friendly.  It must have been a failure on Disney's marketing, because I quite enjoyed it and am sad there won't be more films (I believe this was planned as the first movie in a trilogy).  I guess I will just have to read the books, which by the way, are in the public domain so they are available for free downloads.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I love this bible and it has been a great study tool.  It is very informative and helps to get a good grasp on the scripture.  Much insight and pulls things together well.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|It looks at your contacts. I don't see why they need to see that. Very invasive to my privacy. I do not like the permissions.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Saw recomendations on it at Goodreads,  and glad I did.<br />Great story line on a new way to approach the end of world genre.<br />Cannot wait for final book.
0547391005|5.0|Master 3 is absorbed in the tales of Curious George and his endearing, non-PC adventures. George is much like a three year old, which is why he's such a hit with the littlies. Superb illustrations. Highly recommended for bedtime.
B00005N5S2|5.0|The USA had some brilliant generals during World War ll. Patton, Bradly, Eisenhower and The Old Soldier, MacArthur. His hubris was his undoing with President Truman.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|These two seasons were wonderful.  I didn't know much about the story so it was all a pleasant surprise.  I'm about to watch Season 3 now and looking forward to it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think this is a wonderful and well-made series. It gives you an insight of what life was like at the beginning of the last century. I had grandparents that lived in that era that came from Ireland and it was of special interest to me. It is a show you can sit down with you family and watch. P.S. It is extremely addictive!
B000002KIK|2.0|I find it amazing how die-hard fans refuse to admit that their musical heroes are capable of producing sub-par music. How can anybody give this 4+ stars?<br /><br />Sabotage was the last great Sabbath album. Never Say Die and Technical Ecstacy are completely disposable. Perhaps compared to the plethora of lame copy/paste metal bands going around these days, Never Say Die might sound pretty good, but Sabbath were so much better than this.<br /><br />Just saw their Melbourne concert a couple of days ago, and, apart from one song where Ozzy seemed about to lapse into a coma,  they were still brilliant - but only when they played their classic material from their first 6 albums. The later stuff?....forget about it!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|good acting, well directed, high production values and an imaginative new world. Granted the characters are pretty black and white but that works for most people and with so much else going for it I can tolerate the lack of moral ambiguity that really takes things up a notch.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good Game But A Little Too Short For The 5 Dollar Full Game Charge. Enigmatis Ghost Of Maple Creek Is Far Better and Cheaper.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|If you like Star Wars this is an Awesome game. Well worth the initial 99 cents. Graphics, sound are great. The other 2  tables are $1.99 a piece, your only buying the first one for 99 cents. Good fun!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I'm not even finished with this game yet but I am really enjoying it thus far, the price tag is worth the game!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved.this book. I would recommend it to everybody. I can't wait to start the next one in this trilogy. Excellent
0143106333|5.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is quite possibly my favorite children's book, and the inspiration for my own novel! My son was equally enamored by the story. A true masterpiece and a must-read for all children!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Off brand charger had problems after months of normal use. Called Amazon because I heard they were issuing new Kindle Fire HDs to people having problems with 3rd party chargers. They offered this cable and the charger as a first fix before issuing a new device. I was skeptical it would work but it started charging right away, and fast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a cool game and is always is mixing it up with different prizes but if you play it consistently you'll get really board of it. I hope this helped u see a good game.
B000DN5W4I|4.0|This is a relatively short and sweet dvd. But for me it has more of Joe's earlier playing which is interesting.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|somewhat enjoy some of the levels, my young (6 yr. old) lost interest after a few levels.  what can I say.....
1603427244|4.0|I like the book. The instructions are easy to follow. It iis easy to look up stitches based on use.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|able to see what is happening where all my family members are and helps me decide what I need to wear or be concerned about on my daily jaunts.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|You think you're reading a lonely hearts book, about finding true love. Well, you are, but not the romance you anticipate! This is a well written book, with delightful, quirky characters, that twists and turns and come out oh, so very right in the end. A darn good read.
B004UID2LC|4.0|really good for finding out about many subjects.<br />a little to much info choices, sometimes difficult to know exactly which one to see......
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series leaves me speechless after every episode.  If you want to have every emotion you have assaulted this is the show for you.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|A little long and drawn out in parts but well worth sticking with it. Spaghetti western meets a blood bath. All the actors immersed themselves in their characters. Only give a B- to Stephen played by Samuel L. Jackson. Not only was it a poor makeup job but he acted like he was trying to keep from laughing many times. Good thing his role was not a big part. Very bloody shoot-em-up scenes but the slow motion gave it a flair of B Western artistry. Lastly the music, definitely added to the total dimension of this Quentin Tarantino movie.
B00C7JCDO8|3.0|As others have said, age is apparent. Is this love is unlistenable. It's still worthwhile to give a listen and sing along to a great set list.
B00BESCJII|4.0|This film has hints of classic coming of age drama written all over it. It is reminiscent of John Hughes and the connection to the characters that he was able to bring to the screen. I would definitely recommend it - though it may actually be slightly dark for some people. It's not quite Sixteen Candles....it's Sixteen Candles if Sixteen Candles was clinically depressed.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I had my doubts on how this would work but after tying it out I was pleasantly surprised. I can work away from home on my desktop without any issues.
0865478007|5.0|I know that Big Pharma is a double-edged sword: amazing, life-saving products at ridiculous prices, but this book clearly delineates some of the sleazier practices used to get less essential products on the must-have list by concealing negative results.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|As a fan first of Doctor Who I started watching Torchwood to find out about Jack. It was great. The more adult forum was very nice to see and you definitely build a new relationship with the new set of characters. I've now watched it as much as I watch Doctor Who and like it equally as much. Great show and I hope one day Russell T. Davies comes back to it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|NO SPOILERS HERE, I just wanted to say that this season was heart-pounding, jaw dropping, most phenomenal show I have ever watched in my life. I very highly recommend it. Even if you don't have a preference for zombies, or blood and guts, it will hook you and you'll be addicted before you know it. :-)  CHECK IT OUT!! YOU WON'T BE SORRY. (*I don't recommend it for children...adults only due to graphic content)
B007WZ55XI|4.0|I have been using a power-meter for about a year now.  But, until reading this book was missing out on a lot of the information available to me.  I was just getting the basic: average power per interval and total kilo-joules expended.  The power-meter can help with a lot more like figuring out whether you should train harder or rest.  Great book!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful game with intelligent puzzles.  You had to think a bit, but there was some logic behind it all.  Just enough help if you got stuck.  I would like to see more games like this.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|I have been looking for an app that does this for weeks and couldn't even find something close. Still in the early stages using this but so far I'm really impressed. I followed another reviewer's advice and downloaded a replacement voice via Ivona which is working well, but I didn't compare to the default.
0385349947|5.0|When I chose this book, I wasn't expecting it to be a book that I couldn't put down. Usually, I put books like these in the \\"definitely should read for my own self-improvement, but will probably only make it through a chapter or two at a time\\" category. Sandberg's book, however, fell into the \\"can't put it down\\" category right from the start.<br /><br />Sandberg has written a comprehensive book about the multiple problems women face in the working world today, along with suggested solutions to those problems. Right from the start, and throughout the book, Sandberg acknowledges that society and corporations have a long way to go in ensuring women achieve equality and success. She adds to that by explaining the various ways that women sometimes hold themselves back, sometimes without even realizing it. For example, she talks about how women will sometimes hold themselves back from a new promotion or job because of the fear of balancing that new position with family life - sometimes even years before the woman expects to have children. She gives plenty of examples, such as how she noticed that women will often choose to sit around the perimeter of a conference room, instead of at the table.  I was particularly intrigued by Sandberg's descriptions of how women sometimes hold other women back, whether it be because of the idea that there is only enough room at the top for one woman or how female bosses can be harsher on woman subordinates than male subordinates. Finally, I thought the chapter on mentoring was invaluable, particularly Sandberg's focus on switching the instructions from being \\"get a mentor and you will excel\\" to \\"excel and you will get a mentor.\\"<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any woman, no matter where she is in life and her career. It has definitely made me more aware of some of the pitfalls in the working world that I need to avoid and I'm sure I will be referring back to this book for months to come.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|This one is much better. You are given a start, and some instructions at the start. It's hard enough to make you think, but not impossible.<br />I like this game, and the graphics are also good.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone interested in child welfare, mental illness, or how much our early  environment contributes to the adult we become.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|GREAT INFORMATIVE HISTORY OF THE EAGLES & GREAT OLD & NEW PERFORMANCES!!! ALSO GLEN FREY & DON HENLEY'S SOLO CAREERS ARE COVERED!!! PERFECT!!!
B008JFUO36|5.0|I am usually not a fan of Science Fiction. But I really liked this movie. It is visually stunning. The acting is great. The story is good. I like that it goes at a slower pace than most modern movies. The music was great. I will go see it again and buy the DVD when it comes out.....
B0070DOHQS|4.0|Made it easy to control the RDP session via the HTC EVO even though the screen size is not that big compared to tablets or a Galaxy note. Nice gestures and movement of the cursor.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this was a fun game until I updated it. it won't load the game anymore! otherwise it was a fun game.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I don't really know how this book, single-minded as it was, kept me wanting to see what would happen next, but I believe it was the superior depth of Landay's characterization.  We're really seeing this unfold in the mind of the father, and as a parent, that's so loving and difficult at the same time.  This book was really worth the read.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Man I wish I could have seen them all but the instant video ran out before I had the chance. This girl carries awkward in high school so well. She doesn't let it destroy her but in many casses wears it as a badge.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This is a good movie.  I can watch movies over and over again.  The more I watch it the more I like it.  It is thought provoking, plus top notch acting.
075669812X|5.0|This book was as described, in new condition, and delivered promptly.  My grandson continues to enjoy looking through it and learning the characters.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Get this app, it is the best version of cut the rope.<br />It has twice as much candy, monsters,  and awesomeness.
B00AHTYGRW|3.0|I fell asleep watching this movie three different times.  The Academy blew it again this year.  Argo can't hold a candle to Lincoln, Django or Zero Dark Thirty.  When I finally was able to stay awake to see the whole thing I thought, &#34;This movie was just okay.&#34;
B0000DBK9X|1.0|I purchased this disc with high hopes because I love this movie only to receive it and not have it play. The disc is not for region 1 players so there is nothing I can do about it but it would have been nice to know before I bought it. Looks like I'll have to repurchase from a different outlet.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|Such a helpful boom for those of us with curly hair that has a mind of its own! Hard to get a stylist to dry cut it, still working toward that!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|We all know that Jordan had lost his way with the series, but this ties up everything really well and is easily the best substitute authoring I have ever read. I am only a medium leve fan of Brandon Sanderson, but he has excelled here with his finish of Jordan's work.he should be proud, I think Jordan would have been.<br /><br />In the end a thoroughly satisfying and well rounded end to the series. Thank the light it is finally here!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Wish there was a better end!  Well at least a conclusion of what the future held!  It just kinda<br />Leaves you hanging wanting more.  Such a great series!  Keeps you on edge until the end, never knowing what's next!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is soo addicting! I haven't been able to set it down! The only thing that may be a problem for you is that you need Internet. Other than that this game is amazing!!!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this funny book. I would read this book again it made me laugh and cry. I love how he stood up for his wife
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I didn't think it was a good show at 1st but now I love it........<br />......really interesting love it wow!!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have an E-Bay store and this keeps me connected through my Kindle when I travel,  I access E-Bay all the time at home and it is nice to be able to access it on my Kindle
B00AK0X5VQ|1.0|Would not load on my Kindle White as expected.  Loaded on my tablet - haven't had time to play it yet.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is great, I don't have to carry a separate calculator or my laptop when I shop, I always have my kindle with me., makes my life easier.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Would not load on my Kindle White as expected.  Loaded on my tablet - haven't had time to play it yet.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is such a great game totally worth it. Reminds of wow so much especially with the mendal race they are like a gnome goblin and yoda
B004SDEP38|5.0|Opens files easily without a lot of pushing to upgrade. It does what you want. Opens, editable, updates. Works like MS Office.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|A most interesting plot and well told. The ending is a downer. A taut, exciting thriller. It does involve the seedier parts of a society.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app. I have my other Bibles, but this is so convenient to be able to share the Scripture of the day and to listen to portions of the Bible audibly.  You can highlight, take notes, post your thoughts or a message from church.  This Bible app allows you to access several versions of the bible, from KJV, NIV, ESV, Message, etc...What a wonderful resource. I'm still going to use my Bible (paper), but this app is a wonderful addition.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Not the best book.....I hear the movie is great, and I would hope so. It was hard to get through.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This is a top notch sci-fi series. Every episode leaves you wanting more. Good cast and good aliens and solid storylines.
B00BW5K5DO|2.0|Like the game but it freezes up when you try to tab to build and etc. Have to exit,save and go back in. Waste of time and upsetting.  I won't be buying the full game. I like wish it would work right. Fix the bugs.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I bought these for my husband per his request.  He likes to use these when he jogs.  He likes this particular style.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Great game apart from the annoying pop ups. Asking for a review between EACH game.Would have been 5 stars if it was not for this.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  It keeps you spellbound and stretches your brain with the philosophical wonders of India.  Autobiographical in nature, beautifully written coupled with great descriptive powers, It entertains while it forces you to think
1601252463|5.0|I was VERY reluctant to using this book in my games but after using it for a couple of my characters, it will always be included in any future PF game I run.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I'm amazed at the thought that had to go into keeping this story straight. I agree with another review that the journal that was kept secret was written so well, almost like a novel itself. However, it wouldn't have been as effective any other way. In my mind, I know Crissy is fine. I LOVED this story. Thank you S. J. Watson!!!!!!!!!
0786838655|4.0|It started out very Potter-ish but changed into a different variation of it. The inclusion of the Greek mythos was a great component.
B00B4YAQ5A|5.0|Been listening to these guys since Wheels of Steel when I was 10 years old (showing my age here).<br /><br />Some ok albums between then and now... Innocence is No Excuse was a favorite. This latest album features some amazing production, great playing and awesome songwriting. To see these guys still rocking after all this time (they seemed old even back in 1979!) is amazing.<br /><br />Keep it up guys. It's a pity they never really caught on the states to the rate they deserve.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|It is very good to be able to read a book that has meaning in it.  I enjoyed the way Paulo Coelho put this book together.  An easy enjoyable book.  Thank you for your words of greatness.
B008Y79IUE|3.0|Shows you the lows of drugs and why it is best to avoid them.<br />The movie was intense and moving.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|sean penn was fantastic in this.  Good plot that flowed well throughout. Strong female characters that helped with the plot
B000NY12CI|5.0|Really entails what children go thru in different households and cultures. Opens up my eyes to different things. Makes me think of my upbringing
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An excellent book that truly brings life to the soul and helps any doubter to know that heaven is real and more beautiful and peaceful than anyone could imagine.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I would like an info page that tells me exactly what the multipliers do ect. Other than that its a pretty cool game.  I'm hooked.  Lol maybe change the scenery sometimes to in the woods or something but then it wouldn't be subway surfing.  It recently changed to Tokyo which is cool. Things change in just enough time for me not to get bored. The shoe things get on my nerves I usually end up dying because of them.  One thing I think would make me love this game would be if the hover board didn't have a time on it.  If u could use it until you hit something then it goes away that would be awesome or if u could buy more time for it.  Lots more time.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great fun to play with the grandchildren. We can spend time together playing on my Kindle without getiing too serious.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is an amazing app that simulates taking care of a real horse! In my opinion, my horse is one of the greatest apps created since tv.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|keeps you trying to see where it is going , easy to read  and stays flowing plus full of interesting facts
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is Okay. The only thing I don't like is that you are running from a cop. I am eleven and I don't think running from a cop in a video game should be a fun thing to do. Although this is only my opinion and there have been way worse video games.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I am a true fan of LOST, but I don't wear the clothing lol. This final season can be viewed so many ways, which is what makes it great. You end up with your own opinion, actually learning a bit about yourself, and will always have a question mark in the back of your mind about this series as a whole. Make sure you watch the extras! That really helps answer some questions too. Once a year I watch the whole thing and get something new out of it. This season is a mind boggler. Enjoy!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|It's like a decent Grand Theft Auto game for only $5 the dialogue is annoying at times and the driving is tough but it's still a good game none the less.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Can't wait for Amazon to get season three and PBS to make season four.  It is as if I am in 1920 England.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I have just started playing Hey, That's My Fish!, but I can already tell that it is addicting!  There really is strategy involved - tying to figure out how to get the most fish while blocking off your opponents....  even writing about it now makes me what to grab my FIre and play a few games......  hmmmm, maybe that housework can wait!
B009BJAPLK|5.0|If you're looking for a movie-length program to watch, consider Sherlock. The casting for Sherlock Holmes is great and the story-lines are intriguing enough you keep you engaged. However, these episodes do seem to build on each other, so it's best to watch them in order.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|My husband and I were very entertained as somehow it managed to rise above the usual thriller. I'm probably old fashioned but it was nice not to have it so peppered with the f--- word that you could hardly follow the dialogue. Tom Cruise did his usual good job.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|adds more puzzles and strategy to the same formula as the first game.  The price is also good at .99 cents.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It is refreshing and delightful to see a series of timeless stories with characters who are fleshed out so you feel you really know them.  Also the settings are beautiful and the music engaging and appropriate  for the time and place.  In this age of mostly sex,violence and innuendo  to keep the watchers coming back, it is lovely to see something that depends on story and characterization that  you can watch with your grandchildren..
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love this case when the ear piece gets low I just put it in the case and it charges right back up. It is good to have when traveling long trips.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I remember well when this happened and of course, knew how it ended.  But I still sat on the edge of my seat the whole time.  Affleck did an incredible job and he and all the cast were riveting.  Also, it was nice to have the comic relief of Alan Arkin and John Goodman in such a tense story.  It was heart lifting and inspiring.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I've had this app for a while &amp;' it's a cool app. It's fast, and reliable. But I'm bored now so kik me @ThatBxtch_Tater .!! Thanks :)
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|What a coincidence that all of the positive reviews are either from the week of Jan 15 or today. Coincidence NOT! If you are going to fake reviews, at least try to be convincing. On top of that, this is quite simply spyware - install at your own risk.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is amazing. You can even make halo stuff. For a spartan, type DEMOLITIONIST. It will work. Awesome game!
1742200508|5.0|Lonely Planet's 40th-anniversary edition of its guide to England, as it promises, covers the Scepter'd Isle from Land's End to Lindisfarne. While of necessity--even at nearly 850 pages--it can't provide exhaustive detail on everything it covers, it does give us entertaining and informative snapshots of a wide range of English landmarks and attractions. Of course the most space (about 100 pages) is devoted to London, but there are substantial sections on every region in England, with special attention devoted to major cities and popular tourist areas.<br /><br />Readers look to Lonely Planet to provide the quirky details other guides don't bother with. In its guide to England--the land that invented quirkiness--it certainly doesn't disappoint. The Dinosaurland Fossil Museum in Lyme Regis? The annual Cheese Rolling at Cooper's Hill in the Cotswolds? Ezekial Bone's Robin Hood Tours in Nottingham? They're all there, and much, much more. The lovely thing about the Lonely Planet guides is that they whet your appetite to visit even the places most tourists would never think of going. For example, the guide's authors make a special plea for Bristol as \\"one of Britain's quirkiest and coolest cities...reinvent(ing) itself over the past decade as a hub of culture and creativity.\\" Even with a town like Hull--which the guide admits is \\"a curmudgeonly British seaport\\"--the authors provide an overriding reason to visit: the Larkin Trail, a self-guided tour past significant landmarks in the life of Hull's most famous son, the poet Philip Larkin. (Not surprisingly, considering Larkin's life, the landmarks include a goodly number of pubs.<br /><br />Lonely Planet's England guide is an excellent trip planner. Even more, however, it is a wish book, revealing all the charming places we tourists would visit if we only had the time. It helps us travel in our imaginations, as much as in reality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the hunger games series and thank you Susan Collins for such a wonderful and extravagant series. I read the hunger games right when it came out and was waiting for a while for the new book catching fire to come out and loved it, so thanks again to Susan Collins for such a great series
0385349831|4.0|When I purchased this book, I was expecting something along the lines of historical or historical fiction. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find this to be a really great inspirational book that almost leans towards a daily meditational reading. Each chapter is succinct, quick/easy to read, and teaches another great &#34;truism&#34; about living life right. I found myself highlighting and ear-marking several pages for quick future reference. I was also occasionally surprised by the Copt's answers to some questions, saying things that made me feel more realistic about the human experience instead of guilty about our human nature. This is a fast, easy, unique book from which I think everyone would gain some inspiration for daily living.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|My son likes games that you evolve and make the animal newer. He said he didn't like anything else.maybe a younger crowd would like
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I can not trust recommendations from Kindle! What a weird sad hard to read story!<br /><br />Another horrific childhood abuse story! Enough already!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I read reviews for this book before reading it. Had it not been my book club's selection I may never have read it. After reading the book I had to wonder whether the reviewers actually read the book! This book not only empowers any women who strives for or already is in a leadership position, but provides useful information for how to negotiate and plan for your career. Since a large majority of women are in relationships (i.e. co-habitating and/or married), this empowerment also helps the family unit, and the strategies she suggests work equally for women and men.<br />There are two important tenets I gleaned from this book. It will take more women in leadership roles to level the playing field between men and women in leadership roles. The dynamics need to change such that the female gender is no longer an adjective when describing positions in the work force. Additionally, our society needs to develop a respect for both women and men as vital components of our society whether one chooses to lean into her career in the work force or lean into his career as a stay at home dad.<br />Sheryl Sandberg describes the problem, analyzes the perpetuity, and suggests strategies for moving toward greater equity.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Great program. with lots of flexability.  I use it for lots of things besides just a nice mellow wakeup call.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Casting, scripts, humor...it's all there. I can't wait for the new season! Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are amazing and they deserve all of the accolades coming their way right now.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is one of the best. David is a fantastic doctor. The plotlines are great and the \\"Fires of Pompeii\\" is one of my favorites.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I bought Fight Club because I've loved the movie every time I've seen it, and I wanted to know what I was missing.<br /><br />Some book-after-movie experiences aren't worth it. (Clockwork Orange, for example, did not make me happy to read it.) This one, though, passes back beautifully, and I ended upper attached to the original story than the book. Which is a nice feeling.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying out his other material!
B00C7TAF3Y|3.0|The game was challenging but way too short. I finished it in one afternoon at work, between clients.  The notes stashed throughout the puzzle were of no help in solving anything. Maybe if there was more of a back story I would have felt differently about the ending. A bit more back story, a bit more suspense, notes that mean more = longer play time. Thanks for a different kindle-game experience though. I enjoyed it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Liked this one, great Sci Fi. Good storyline, haven't read anything quite like it. Looking forward to more from this author.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Love this movie and it brought me back to my childhood.  The DVD case was wrapped and in great condition!  Thanks!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Clearly the people who vehemntly criticized this book early on did not read it carefully.  Sheryl Sandberg does a wonderful job talking about some pretty tough issues with a keen level of insight which is drawn not only from her personal experiences, but research and the experiences of other professional women and men!  She offers great practical tips throughout.  It was very disappointing to see this book so harshly criticized, esp by women.  We should have the opposite response - she is using her power and influence to advance the cause of women which should be deeply commended.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I Am 9 Years Old And This Game Seems For Kids 8 And  Up But ,It Isn't.<br />The Age Range For This Game Is 3 Through 7<br /> That's All I Really Gotta Say
B00AESN8XY|4.0|good game money well spent its cool . you make a illness that spreads everywhere and kills everyone and everything. u pick everything in that game too.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I love this movie and it works well for all ages!  I also love that my daughter can see a disney movie that doesn't involve a princess...
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|As a long time Sherlock Holmes fan I was dubious of yet another remake. I was however delighted by this treatment of the venerable detective. To update and still remain true to the character is a hard task. The biggest surprise has to be Lucy Lu as Watson, no bumbling mumbling octogenarian but an intense sharp wit well matched to the acerbic Sherlock. It looks like the game is well and truly afoot. Well played ladies and gentleman.
B005H9B44A|3.0|The special effects and cinematography are superb, and Natalie Portmen is always worth a look-see; however, the noise and commotion is a bit much for an old geezer like me.  I like a bit tamer fare!

B00028HBKM|5.0|I got the package in the mail and it made a funny noise. I thought the disk was broken. I opened it and the DVD was fine. It was part of the dad case that had fallen off. The DVD has no scratches and I'm happy with it

B003VPWXRO|4.0|I enjoyed this story as someone recovered from an eating disorder and like Portia, I want others to have the same success. Well written and truly inspirational and honest. It's important people know the depths of it to understand such a complicated health issue. I'm glad she addressed dieting like she did at the end. I also hope her struggles with sexuality can help others even if they don't have the same support. The end of this book should be read by everyone.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I totally love this cd, I play 10 in my car coming home from work and I have it on my mp3 player for work.  It's all I can<br />do at work to keep from dancing and jamming!
0525953728|3.0|I thought this book had a good flow to it.  I blew through the book, I think mainly because I was wanting the author to get to the part that I wanted to read....the night the US killed Osama Bin Ladin.  The author does what he should have done and talks about who he was and how he grew up and all of the events that it took for him to become a Navy Seal.  The book does a good job explaining the training that goes on along with all of the equipment that they Seals have at their dispense.  There are times in the book that he talks about other missions he was a part of, which gets pretty interesting.  The book does get pretty exciting when he talks through the training and practice that they went through getting ready for the raid.  The actual tale of the night that they got him left a little to be desired in the excitement category, but if you are in between books and would like to get a \\"first hand\\" account of what happened that night, then I would go ahead and read this book.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|I got this app only because I wanted to write a review to counter all of the disgraceful, fake 5-star reviews posted by Liquid Entertainment and their accomplices.  This is the kind of B.S. that ruins the App Store for everyone.  Also, why should I give Liquid Entertainment access to my list of running tasks?  They don't need this.  The idea of paying Liquid Entertainment for extra stars in this game is absurd.  I would highly suggest avoiding this game any other Liquid Entertainment apps!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book was so hard to put down. It is filled with love adventure and great characters. I would recommend thus book to teens,tweens,and adults. I loved it!
1455523550|4.0|A young woman desperate to change her life and a widower just beginning to realize that life goes on find their \\"Safe Haven\\" in each other in this romantic suspense tale from author Nicholas Sparks. Erin Tierney began her marriage with the hopes of all young brides for a happy family life with a loving husband and children to cherish. Instead, she suffered years of physical and psychological abuse from her jealous and controlling husband, Kevin, a detective with the Boston Police Department. After more than one failed attempt to flee her personal Hell, Erin plots a meticulously timed and executed escape. While blonde Erin Tierney seemingly vanishes, dark-haired Katie Feldman travels a circuitous route down the East Coast, finally settling in Southport, North Carolina. Quiet and personable, with few possessions, and having missed more than her share of meals and someplace to call her own, Katie begins working in a local eatery called \\"Ivan's\\". Renting an old cabin just outside of town, she walks back and forth to work and to the local mercantile. The owner of the store, Alex Wheatley, is a widower with two small children. He notices Katie each time she comes to shop, and he tries to keep the things she buys in stock--looking forward more and more to seeing her in the store. Katie senses his interest in her, but she is not looking for a relationship, and she is keeping a very big secret. The somewhat mysterious woman who rents the cabin close to Katie's is named Jo, and she and Katie become friends. According to Jo, Alex is a good man, and he would never hurt Katie. Before Alex had married his wife, Carly, he had spent years in the army as a criminal investigator, and he is very familiar with the characteristics of an abuse victim. He recognizes that Katie is hiding many truths, but that doesn't stop his attraction, and soon he and Katie and the children began spending time together. Katie cannot deny the appeal of Alex and the children, and eventually she tells Alex the truth of how she came to be in Southport. All the while that Katie has been building her new life, the threats from her past have continued to escalate back in Boston with the psychotic behavior of the left-behind Kevin, who will stop at nothing to find her and punish her for leaving him. The author allows this story to be told from the perspective of all three lead characters, and the insights into the violently-distorted mind of the Bible-quoting Kevin are extremely chilling. Once Kevin zeroes in on Katie's location, events will unfold which will forever change all their lives. Nicholas Sparks writes with intensity about abuse and its lasting, widespread effects-not just on the victim, but on those who care for the victim. All of us, whether we realize it or not, know someone who has been abused at some point in their life. The first reaction to abuse is denial. It's a subject which makes people uncomfortable, and the victims often linger in a very painful silence. Writing about it may encourage someone who is a victim to seek help. Acknowledgement is not only a first step, it's a giant leap toward reaching out for peace of mind and a chance of personal happiness.the truth of how she came to be in Southport.

B009UNGYHG|5.0|It is a very handy charger to have that is portable. I was also able to charge my headset 3 times before having to plug the charger in. Excellent product.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|My husband and I had a great time watching this movie. We had a new born and also bought the book to learn how to take care of a new born and care for baby. It packed in a lot of key points and humor from the book.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Every episode is interesting. The character development is solid. Love the casting. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a longer series drama.
B001HDWKMA|5.0|I love Gossip in the Grain,  Ray LaMontage's music is honest, beautiful and soothing. He is a wordsmith of the highest caliber. I recommend this album to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You learn from the kids mistake when playing this game.  It encourages you to learn and exercise.  I like ninjas and tag bot the most!
B005HED11Y|5.0|What more is there to say, Kirk, Spock and Bones all team up for great times! I grew up watching reruns of this on Saturdays after cartoons.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I was surprised at the humor in this movie. Given the subject matter, I expected it to be dark and scary. It is that, at times, but the darkness is often of the &#34;dark humor&#34; variety. I found it to be suspenseful and fascinating and not nearly as heavy as based-on-a-true-story tends to be.
B0036G1T78|5.0|Robert Redford never goes out of style. He and Faye are great in the timeless movie. Great story, and plot.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|My grandson wanted to see Jaws because he had heard so much about it. I watched it with him and found myself on the edge of my seat like I'd never seen it before. The special effects are just as effective as in some of the new computer generated movies.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This Lavalier is perfect for recording in areas where you wish to focus the sound and remove much of the external noise.  It has a very long cord which is, at times, a challenge to maneuver.  One quick tip:  Always clip the battery compartment to a pocket or something where there will be NO SKIN CONTACT.  Any touches will result in a serious buzz through the mic and into the recording.  After multiple minutes trying to detect the source of the noise we discovered that problem.  It is VERY sensitive to touch!  That is all which would make the difference between 4 and 5 stars.
B00AHTYI5M|3.0|It was okay, full of suspense.  But I do not enjoy<br />movies that are laced with filthy language.  Good<br />stories can be told without all the cursing.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is great. I'm loving it. I learn new things. I get to rest and listen to soothing music. It's. wonderful. You should get it too!
B009R659L8|5.0|Great book, but you would not expect anything else from Mary Higgins Clark. All of her books are awesome. Recommend to everyone.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The dynamic of these two is outstanding, both create very unique personalities that meld together flawlessly.  I have read the originals, seen the old movies, seen the new movies and series' - this is my favorite Holmes Watson duo yet.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Good movie, well developed plot, fast paced. Main characters are mostly fleshed out, but several are left to the imagination. Overall, I liked the movie.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|It was OK; it was hard to follow the action---too much happening at once.  The plot was a little thin in places.
B009R659L8|5.0|Just  as  expected  with Mary Higgins Clark  it's a  page turner  from  the  beginning!  Everyone has a  secret  and  things start  coming to light  little by little.  Just when you think you have it figured out there's a twist  and you're back to scratching your head.  And The ending is not what you expected! I  absolutely  loved  this book!!
B0070DOHQS|5.0|nice and minimal user interface,  Easy to setup and controlling the mouse using a touchscreen is made effortlessness. now using other VNC apps is unconfortable
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Parts of this story were based on similar historical situations that I found difficult to read through, at times.  Others sections were so full of quirky detail and description that I laughed out loud!  The characters were memorable and well developed.  I loved the ending although I was on the edge of my seat the entire last chapter!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This funny story of how humans and villians can get along, how much a father loves his daughter and how everyone makes changes in their lives to collectively love each other.  Funny lines, great story and more. I would recommend for any age.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|It's  Avery good app its interesting I play it all the time I have a high score on this app everyday when I come home from school I play it and sometimes I play it on the buss all the time most everyday trust me u'll love it
B008602KQI|5.0|What would our world be like if after WWI or WWII or Vietnam war, the government decided what would happen to us [to play God] with out lives: who survives, who eats, how we live.  This movie is a great eye opener as to how our lives could actually turn out [in the future] but this is just one person's idea.  This is a great movie, great actors, great ideas for survival, how the other half lives, how to behave, friendships, and strength.... Recommend this movie &#34;Yes&#34; and cannot wait for the next movie. Go Katniss!
1451695195|5.0|Very thought provoking book. Eben's adoptive Dad was one of  my husband's instructors at Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem , NC
B0056JJXOO|5.0|This movie by Franco Zeffirelli was wonderful, it brought out the best acting and timeless love shown for this classic Shakespear movie Romeo and Juliet.  Their feelings for each other, the conflict of the families, the music.  Easy to follow and understand in the poetic devices.  Would recommend for most ages.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Great lightweight remote desktop app! It really is super easy to use and VERY responsive compared to the competition I have used. This was highly worth a purchase, but making it the FAOTD was spectacular.
B001VEE5KK|5.0|I love this movie.  Although another entry to the &#34;Holocaust genre&#34;, a very compelling point of view.  Although movie &#34;stars&#34; Ralph Fiennes and Kate Winslet (Academy Award winning role), young German actor, David Kross, has the most challenging role portraying a different survivor at age 15 and later as a law-school student in the late 1960's.  This was a significant time in Germany history, in the aftermath of the Holocaust.  In American, campuses were at the center of unrest, primarily related to U.S. involvement in Viet Nam.  Campuses across Germany fomented similar unrest, often following the activities of the U.S. protest movement.  These were Germany's own &#34;Baby Boomers&#34;.  Like myself, they were children of the World War II generation; and they were plenty angry.  Actually, many were infuriated when realizing their parent, teachers, and political leaders had participated with the NAZI rule; the &#34;Red Army&#34;, somewhat akin to the U.S. &#34;Weather Underground&#34;, was the radical voice of this movement.  Understanding this part of German history, made this film all the more compelling.  Recommend this film as well as further inquiry into this piece of history.  On its own, &#34;The Reader&#34; (movie and English translation of the book on which it's based) is fascinating and filled with emotions.  A little background greatly enhances the experience.
055380684X|5.0|Looks at talent from every perspective.  Changes is the brain circuits, specific training secrets, hereditary significance, the importance of early coaches/teachers, different strategies for various sports and other skillsets.<br /><br />From all this a coach or teacher can look back and identify with things that really were effective and see the similarities of their methods to the methods outlined in the book.  Absolutely enlightening.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|While most people think of Rambo as a gung-ho killing machine, he is in fact so much more. First Blood is the first Rambo movie and my favorite because it does such a good job of developing the character. Vietnam veteran John J. Rambo, a man who has lost everything and experienced unimaginable suffering, both physical and emotional, just wants to be left alone. Unfortunately, he lives in a world that persecutes what it doesn't understand, and he soon finds himself in violent conflict with Sheriff Teasle, expertly played by Brian Dennehy. Teasle cares little for Rambo's problems and simply wants to punish loiterers. When he and his men push the war hero too far, Rambo's training--and PTSD--kick in and he explodes into the Oregon wilderness, bent on finishing what they started.<br /><br />First Blood also has my favorite movie scene: the climactic and heart-wrenching finale between Rambo and his father figure Colonel Trautman (the incomparable Richard Crenna). In this scene, Rambo goes into graphic detail concerning the suffering he endured in 'Nam and when he got back home to a world he didn't recognize and who suddenly hated him. He is a tragic figure who only wants the pain to stop, but he doesn't know how to achieve that. Having been to that place myself, I relate to him more than any other fictional character.<br /><br />First Blood is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Ive read this series for over 20 years and it has kept my interest since the beginning. Its sad to see it finally end but Im glad Robert Jordan was able to leave the notes and vision behind and I think Sanderson did a great job. This was a fast paced book with lots of action and plenty of moving moments. Out of the 3 books Brandon Sanderson finished this one feels the most like Jordan throughout. My only compliant was that the publishers kept the ebook back 3 months. Kindle is the only way to go on this series compared to the giant tome of a hardback.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Any fan of the Columbo series would love this set.  Finally I have the complete collection.  I felt it was reasonably priced.
1455523550|4.0|it seems fine, it's just a book, i still need more words so I'll keep typing to satisfy word limit
B005VPRDAY|5.0|This is a great lego for little girls.  The best part is that it came with a container, so you won't find lego piece everywhere.
B000G6R7B8|4.0|wear it alot, very unique from others in my collection, fun to look at and wear to parties as is
0060852712|3.0|While my son and I so enjoy Mr. Dahl's books, typically, we did not enjoy this one so much.  We had listened to James and the Giant Peach many times, as well as Matilda, and look forward to a collection of CD's we just borrowed from the library.  We listen to the CD's while driving during day trips as well as quick trips to the grocery store.  We laugh together and share thoughts as we listen - great family fun.  Try audio books if you haven't yet, but this one.... maybe try another one of Mr. Dahl's.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|Bones is an amazing series with excellent, engaging characters.  The episodes are entertaining and I look forward to them immensely. After watching Bones for many years I have been very pleased with the plot twists and character development.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|I liked this film.  Actually got very choked up at one point.  Amazing true story although would have liked to see more of all the family members' story of how they survived, and not just the Mom's and one son's.  But I do recommend it for all the family members not sensitive to graphic views of physical injuries.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|Great story and great characters. In some scenes the debauchery and gore seem a little contrived. For example there are scenes where characters are having in depth conversations about their schemes or back story while gutting a random animal or having spastic sex. Really doesn't add anything to the scenes in question, which leads me to believe it's often thrown in just to keep those with shorter attention spans watching.<br /><br />Overall it doesn't bother me and usually adds to the experience (Yes, watching this show is an experience). Highly recommend watching.
B00G23JMLW|5.0|It's a very sad but wonderful film about a model called Gia Carangi. Aside from Gia (or should I say Angelina) being somewhat psychotic in some scenes and being addicted to drugs, I highly recommend it. The love between Gia and Linda is beautiful.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|love this movie and if you do its a must get on blue ray. I cant belive its been out over 45 years now wow.
034580404X|5.0|What a great book.
8172238479|5.0|This extraordinary novel is of the variety that you just cannot put down. By far the best book I have read this year.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Pros: Hyperthreading, 2 physical cores/4 logic<br />3.3 GHz<br />Highly popular 1155 socket<br />Can handle any modern game at high detail/reseloution<br />Low power consumption<br />Price<br /><br />Cons: Limited cache<br />Dual core (see other thoughts)<br />Does not enable PCI express 3.0<br /><br />Other Thoughts: Though this CPU is an Ivy Bridge, it will not enable the full bandwidth of PCI express 3.0. This is only slightly minor considering the performance. The hyperthreading allows this CPU to operate as a quad core, yet is cheaper. Temps on idle with a Corsair A70 heatsink is 25 Celsius and 43 Celsius maximum with heavy gaming. Games such as Crysis 2 and Metro 2033 can run at Ultra settings, but with minor performance lag/slowing due to bandwidth limitation.

B0052AC8C6|3.0|Normally I don't like movies that have a darkness but this movie sort of grew on me. I had to get used to the hideous looking characters. The chameleon Rango reminds me of Barney Fife (Andy Griffith Show). I thought that he (Rango) was very funny. I give this movie three stars since I wouldn't recommend for kids. If I was a kid I'd probably have nightmares after watching this movie. I read other reviews recommending for kids, don't believe it!
B00919CI5Q|5.0|I just finished building my first gaming PC over a month ago, and using two of these ASUS cards in SLI. They make a huge difference in games, especially compared to Xbox or PS3. I swapped out the thermal compound for IC Diamond, which cut my temps by ~10 Celsius. My case has tons of fresh intake air, so these cards stay cool, even under full load (52 Celsius max). Games such as Crysis 2, has FPS from 48 minimum to well over 100, with Ultra settings. Metro 2033 had similar results with PhysX and all settings max. I did a lot of research before purchasing, with Linus Tech Tips and Paul from Newegg both doing tests with GTX 660 SLI vs single GTX 680, and the results were very convincing. With whatever card you choose, be sure to enable all the available options via NVIDIA and AMD utilities. I was originally wanting dual 660 TI's, but this cut my cost by $200, though 2 660 TI's go toe to toe with Titan and the TI's can do 3-way SLI (Unlike 660's and below). Also, if you can get these with a rebate, the cost is almost the same as a GTX 650 TI Boost, but better performance. Be sure to check compatibility with your system for power, space, and performance.
B004SI84H6|5.0|I originally had the first version 20 year's ago, I've been trying to go back to the gym but never really had a good workout plan tried getting a personal trainer but that get expensive.  There is nothing like you controling your own body.  So far I've loss 5 percent body fat and getting leaner around the abs. This book talks to everyone from beginning to advance bodybuilding.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|very addicting gets pretty hard at 20000 feet but very fun game i also like gamelofts world at arms fun strategy game great game gameloft keep it up
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|This album has to be by far one of my most favorite albums. The songs are so well done and the way some of the songs directly correlate with other songs from part one make the album that much better. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who loves rock, hard rock or metal. Stone Sour is amazing!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is much better than the original. I love the multiple character. I'm also a fan of the multiplayer area. It allows for much more interesting upgrades. Great game, still not tired of it.
B004S3MB2U|1.0|i downloaded ad free app of the day.  well. there aint somethin for nutin as they say.<br /><br />a little over 2 weeks? it wouldnt run and said redownload from amazon store.<br /><br />imagine that.  i see nowhere to redownload it without buying it.<br /><br />coincidence. i think not.<br /><br />shame on amazon!
B004HD61KE|5.0|Grounded in American history with a bit of fantastical possibility thrown in, Rollins takes his readers on yet another journey through imagination and excitement and hang on to your seat action.  Readers who want to know more about the major players are in for a treat because the Sigma Force has a good backlist that allows readers to get to know characters like Crowe and Pierce.
B0073TZ1AA|2.0|did not know how to stop reader when it starts. i uninstalled it. It needs better instructions. make clearer instructions.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read this after seeing the latest movie. (Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Ann Hathaway)  Hugo can be very &#34;wordy&#34; at times so it is OK to skip through some of this book. You won't miss the heart rending story of Jean ValJean.
B00466HM28|4.0|Great midi keyboard for the price, This is much nicer than I thought it would be based on other reviews.  This is my first midi keyboard.. Ive been making music for 20 years and i'm new to DAW + MIDI stuff, and i'm using this with Ableton 9 with a laptop and it was very simple to setup. Does everything that i need it to do, and has plenty of features given its sub 100$ price tag.  It doesn't not have a dedicated note repeat\ drum roll button nor any pitch/mod wheels but that's just fine for a midi controller in this price category.  Keys feel okay but I could do with more sensitivity, that being said their still plenty usable.  If your looking for a grand piano feel and size well this obviously is not what you should be looking for, but I still have no problems doing some piano work on the MPK mini.  As far as the drum pads go, and there's 8 backlit pads 2 banks for a total of 16! some people complain their to stiff, I'd like more velocity sensitivity like my MPC 2500 but their still okay, I have no problems with them.  Internet tape mods are not needed, their supposed to be beaten on with pressure as that's what gives you the natural feel MPC's are known for.  Putting tape under the pads would surely give easier action but the stiffness is what allows for velocity.  Rotary encoders are decent I'd say my 2500's are a bit better but these are still fine more than I'd expect on a board this affordable.  It has a mini USB which is a bit... Well flimsy but mine sits on a desk and so works fine.  Simply awesome for the price cant go wrong.. I recommend this easily.  Buy the way yes it is made of plastic, but still feels sturdy enough.  I do wish it had old school midi outs and Ins so I could use it with other drum machines etc, but it wasn't designed for that anyway it's for portability.  One thing to mention it does not have a sustain pedal in but since its so small and one hand playing action is how it will be used mostly there is a sustain button included and I have no real problems working it.  There's also an arpeggiator with a bunch of options to mess with.  I'm so glad I bought the MPK mini, it looks great too! Hope you fine this helpful I know the pads are a big issue for some but if your used to an MPC I think you'll understand why stiff is better than those mushy tape modifications.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great books. Very captivating ! Better than twilight !  Couldn't put them down until I finished! Highly recommended to all women AND men who want to please their women :)
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a DeMille fan but this was too drawn out and disappointing.  In light of all the mid east turmoil, this could have been more exciting.
0345525558|5.0|It was surprisingly beautiful. Loved the depth of feeling that it brought out in me ,the strength of love of family whether it's biological or chosen. I'll never think of moss quite the same . Now have a major interest in flowers & want to study them in earnest. I would recommend this book to everybody I know & think I have already. IT WAS JOYOUS.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I know its a musical but TO MUCH SINGING!<br />Anne Hathaway as Fatine was fabulous.Her singing &#34;I dreamed a dream&#34; will bring a tear to your eye.LOVED IT!<br />Samantha Barks as Eponine ,that girl has a set of lungs on her and she can sing-Bravo,young lady.<br />Amanda Seyfried  as Cosette and Eddie Redmayne as Marius were excellent as well.<br />Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean he was excellent, of course!<br /><br />But it would have been just as good if not better for the movie version (this is not Broadway folks) if everyone else did not sing.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|need to know stuff.  should be required viewing for all adults planning on exercising their voting privilege in the coming elections
B003JA5NUA|5.0|Great show love it.  So funny I could watch this over and over again.<br />would reccommend this to everyone of all ages.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I would recommend this brand over the others here on Amazon. This is a good quality and nice feeling unit. Go ahead and buy!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is interactive and you usually don't get that in a building game. You search for your animals, you feed, breed, get buildings, and so forth. I was trying to wait before I gave a review since I am new to the app. From what I can tell so far I like it.
0143122061|4.0|Why did the West win for 500 years?  The author proposes reasonable answers.  The medicine answer is weak, but the others are well supported.  Western political systems, capitalism, science and individualism/humanism/secularism/Protestantism are simply more effective.  Other nations and civilizations who have made the same changes are succeeding.  There is a big backlash from those who cannot make the transition.<br /><br />Ignore the 1 and 2 star reviews.  True believing leftists cannot embrace the obvious and growing value of western civilization.  South Korea, Chile, Singapore, Panama, Israel, Taiwan, Turkey, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, China, Dubai, Indonesia and others are joining the classic European, USA, Canada and Australian societies and adopting many (NOT ALL) western \\"killer apps\\".<br /><br />It is certainly time for a more advanced version of western civilization to be developed and adopted.  Building a better culture is not a game for amateurs.  It is not clear who will provide the next breakthrough.
B00BJO5SXK|4.0|It really is a good album. Yeah he just talks about being rich and smoking weed now, but it's still a good album.
B00907ZZ22|5.0|Firstly, although this movie is super-brilliant, unless you are interested in Formula 1 racing in the 1960's - with a running time of over 3 hours - Grand Prix could be a challenge.  For those of you who dig racing, well, let's just say that Grand Prix is to Formula 1 Racing as Lawrence of Arabia is to historical docu-dramas.  Grand Prix is an EPIC, and Director (a very young) John Frankenheimer's greatest work.  The acting, script, score, locations, and effects are all first rate, but the biggest attraction is the cinematography which created a new paradigm and certainly raised the bar for action camera work.  The film crew found new and innovative ways to strap, mold, bolt and angle 35mm cameras onto and around race cars.  There's no trick photography, when you see a shot from a race car going 185 mph around an embankment, it's real.  Quite frankly, there's nothing like it, even today.  Also, Frankenheimer implemented some very \\"1960's\\" stylistic touches, like split screen, multi screen, montage, etc. - you can clearly see where the cartoon SPEED RACER got all their ideas.  Well, if you've read this far, take the time to see the movie... there's a great story centered around Jim Garner who is a good hearted veteran racer making his comeback, both on and off the track, and of course his interaction with other racers and the ladies:)  And yes, the film is FUELED with high-octane HEMINGWAYESQUE bravado.  Oh and one final thing, do not try to watch this film in sections, it's all or nothing!  Enjoy.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|This is seriously the best show I have ever watched. It will break your heart, but it's worth it. BBC is awesome.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|Bad acting and a predictable plot fortunately doesn't detract too much from a otherwise enjoyable flick. The baddies getaway car, a Chevrolet ZR-1 is Knight Rider reborn. This one of a kind conveyance is faster than a speeding bullet (or helicopter in this case), equipped with infrared (which apparently the FBI doesn't have), an unlimited fuel tank allowing the car to travel at 200 mph all night without refuelling, truck flipping technology with minimal paint damage and off road capabilities which would put any 4x4 to shame.<br />Forest Whittaker wins the most unconvincing character award with his portrayal as FBI Agent John Bannister. After losing a top drug lord on the way to jail, he's given full command on recapturing the evil Gabiel Gomez who believes that driving very fast and devastating road blocks wins hands down over obscurity. Maybe because of the Clint Eastwood accent, Bannister's bosses have complete misplaced faith in his abilities, which luckily Arnie puts right by destroying the town he's Sheriff of in order to apprehend the bad guys. All that aside, there are some great action scenes and a feeling of the old cowboy movies of yesteryear with a fusion of the spaghetti westerns with greats like Rio Bravo. Not one for the squeamish, there are lots of CGI blood effects.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|The book is too much like modern detective writing...<br />full of close-calls, getting hit on the head or shot<br />and I find it totally unrealistic.  I'm not hung up on<br />adrenaline rushes.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Loved the film and was a very good showing picking up from the start and not appearing out of nowhere<br />from the other films.  You get a great grasp on the whole start and why the difference's between the two<br />charactor's leading end up at odd's with things in their ability's.  Also it is rivited with action and suspense<br />to connect all the X-Men movies this far... I hope to see further one's come out with more of them young.<br />I plan on buying it when I can to add to my X-Men movie collection. :)
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I have stopped using the alarm on my tablet and now use Timers4Me plus. More to this app than just an alarm clock though. I have nothing negative to say about it. I like having so many choices for ring tones plus it speaks whatever you label the alarm. So in the morning it can wake you up plus tell you Good Morning! Well worth the cost.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|LOVE IT... excellent action and funny to the top.  Bruce Willis and excellent other actor's do<br />a very funny out take on the action and drama with keeping you on the edge of your seat and yet<br />making you laugh at the same time.  I would seriously even buy this movie to add to my movie collection. :)
B00AQM8H9I|3.0|This seemed a bit confusing at first and took a few games to grasp moves and scoring. The phone screen is really tiny for so much activity, so it works better on a tablet.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Received in excellent condition and well worth the watch with all the disc's.  I love the film and it the message it portray's in it.<br />I would recommend any age watching the film as it is a very good film for all age's though under 10 years may not understand<br />it currently.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I just love the plots and all of the characters. This show has the ability to make you feel a range of different emotions. It has (but is not limited to) humor, suspense, drama, and romance. I've watched other crime shows here and ther, but Castle is by far my favorite. Season five is not quite as amazing as the other seasons, but still gets 5 stars.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Excellent Movie with great action and Sci/Fi features to it.  Was a awesome watch and even want to buy and add to my DVD collection.  I am pretty picky about these things.  My ROKU played it awesome and it played through with great quality with no freezing or issue's renting it on my ROKU player. :)
B007V2UGPE|5.0|if you want to play a game where the fun never stops play this game right now!!!!!!! you will have a great time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This looked like something I could play and not have to think about it.  This was true for the first few levels.  Now I am playing more advanced levels and you really have to think about what you're doing.  It';s actually a pretty good strategy game.  I visualize what I want to do first before I join my dots.  It keeps track of how many tries it takes you to finish the grid. So you feel like a dummy when you finish and it tells you you finished in 55 moves when it should have been 7 or 8. YIKES!!<br />I love this game!!! once I pick it up, I don't put it down again for quite a while.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I couldn't stop playing this! I thought this game was mostly for boys, but im a girl and I cant stop playing. it works great on kindle fire. my fave part of this app is fighting the enemies. just wondering, are there caverns on this version?  I cant find one...
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|i gave it 5 stars because is a movie for children and adults alike.<br />The end is a bit abrupt vs. the beginning.<br />I recommend this movie to everbody.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy playing mahjong and this one is very good and works perfectly no glitches. The grephics are clear and easy to see,good job
B00B3MN65K|4.0|This is a solid effort from Josh. I like it better than Illuminations, which I never listen to (and I am a huge Josh fan). There are a handful of songs that will probably stand out as favorites for me for a long time to come -- Brave; I Believe; Happy In My Heartache.

1401324649|4.0|This comic novel out of Sweden has forced me to examine some of my own biases.  If, for example, you asked me to characterize your average centenarian, I might say kind, wise, and most of all harmless.  Of course, that was before I met Allan Karlsson, the protagonist of Jonas Jonasson's international bestseller, The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared.  The lengthy title perfectly describes the opening of the novel, when on the morning of Allan's hundredth birthday he spontaneously decides to make a break for it, with nothing more on his feet than a pair of slippers.  You might not expect this elderly man to get far, but you'd be surprised.<br /><br />I also would not expect this little old man--who's made it as far as the bus station--to immediately steal a suitcase he's asked to watch.  And so an epic road trip begins, with Allan committing crimes and picking up an intriguing cast of compatriots, both human and not, along the way.  There are many adventures and misadventures along the way.<br /><br />If the above story were the only element of the novel, I would find it only so successful.  I actually found Allan to be a rather difficult to fathom character, and not all that sympathetic.  Character development, in general, isn't the novel's strength.  Where it succeeds is with the outlandish humor and with some really delightful plotting.  And nowhere is this more apparent than in the novel's other main storyline, the biographical recounting of Allan's long, colorful, and very historic life.  Much like another well-known fictional character, somehow Allan Karlsson has wandered through or directly impacted many of the major events of the last century.  I could give a list of the events and people, but better to discover them on your own.  His is truly an extraordinary and international life.  And it was this inventive tale that I far preferred over the contemporary goings on.<br /><br />I can't say that this one was a slam dunk, but it was an undeniably fun read.  Mr. Jonasson gets bonus points for the sheer originality and freshness of the tales he tells, and for warning me off from trusting seemingly harmless little old men!n undeniably fun read.  Mr. Jonasson gets bonus points for the sheer originality and freshness of the tales he tells, and for warning me off from trusting seemingly harmless little old men!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am a huge puzzle fan and this app for the Kindle Fire made the perfect acquisition.  Imaging puzzling on a plane.  It kept me busy and entertained for several flights.  My children love this app as well.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Just a fun, quick read. It was very entertaining. Perfect for pool or beach reading.  Similar feel to her other books.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|For the price this mouse is as good as it gets. It comes with weights and works great. Great for gaming.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|my son loved  it and he will have me get him the next season as well, thank you for the product
140003180X|5.0|This is a delightful series.  Easy, pleasant reading.  You really get to know the characters better and better with each succeeding volume.  I have read 1-9, and now I have to purchase the rest, 10-13.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Funny, I didn't realize it when I first saw it decades ago, but this is a classic both in the context of  work of the actors,  as well as an overall experience.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very fun to play easy to get distracted and just play. my daughter has a very good time and it keeps her entertained while I'm trying to get stuff done!!!
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Really enjoy the show funny as can be. I look forward to the next season. I really like being able to buy individual episodes on Amazon.
B00BEYYEE4|4.0|Broken City while not a perfect film by any stretch....Its immensely watchable...Russel Crowe and Mark Walhberg are in top form here
B004SF2KNI|5.0|Consider the year and what was available regarding the audio quality.  This Album has carried all of us for a part of our lives. Your mileage may vary, but surely this was and continues to be, the perfect marriage of  blues and rock. Clapton is not God, but rather what he has fashioned himself--a Pilgrim. Like most Brits, he understates.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It gave me a lot to think about. The mix of research and personal anecdotes were interesting. I believe that what Sandberg has to say is applicable whether you are interested in becoming a COO or a happy homemaker. &#34;Sit at the table&#34;, &#34;make your partner a partner&#34;, and &#34;don't quit before you quit&#34; is good advice for anyone.  The research she references gave me a new perspective of that eternal question &#34;Why did they...&#34;  I highly recommend this excellent book.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|The best web scraper out there.  With Google reader going away this is the best thing out there. I love this app!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|What else needs to be said? Chris Kyle writes his story very well, this should be on everybody's reading list
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I enjoy the writing.  I like the character.  I will probably read anything he writes.  This one does not need to be read in order.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I tried a different app first, and then this was the Free App of the Day. I downloaded it and have used it for 2 weeks already to get up for work. It works exactly the way I wanted. I can change the music too. There are several loud beeping sounds, but I like to wake up to music so can't review them. It's really easy to change time when needed, too. One thing that's extremely handy, is that you can set the time for the weekday, and have it off on the weekends, when you don't need to get up. It's a great app to have.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|have tried this for a few days and so far I like it. seems to work well without any problems.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|The hype around the book is just way overblown and probably turns away more people than it should. Ok, there are nice marketing moves in the book, and we are socialised to dislike that, but the message of stagnation does stand on its own.  Definitely worth a read.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I just wanted all the movies in 1 set and this box set works for me.  Not sure why anyone would buy other sets before all the movies were released.  I know Warner Brothers is releasing other versions/sets with extra extras but I could care less about all that.  I just wanted the movies together and that's what this is.  With that being said, anyone looking for all the movies together in a nice compact set, this should work for you.  My only complaint is I saw this same set for 50% less at Walmart last Christmas but I wasn't waiting until then.
B002YCVX5S|3.0|Movie would have been ok if it had come out not long after the war.The title is appropriate.I am sure most soldiers felt that way about Hitler and his supporters.It is all History now so for me it lost something as we should have moved on by now.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful cast and storyline!  I can't wait for the next season to begin!  Love Downton and all it's interesting characters!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Gotham did not have that eerie Gotham fell to it in this movie.Batman lost his mysterious feel because he told everyone who he was.Alfred was dedicated,he would never have done what he did.Totally lost the Batman.Somebody did not do their homework as the specks and reality about explosions and warheads was way wrong.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Both my wife and I use Battery HD on our Kindle Fire HD' s only as a charge indicator.  The APP allows to know when the battery is full since there is no indicator light on the Fire. For us this APP was worth the cost.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|The movie is adorable, about two single ladies swapping places. Trying to get away from their former flames. Its cute and funny. Bought this as a gift, and it came with a free digital copy, so I got a copy too! I was pretty excited about this free options that I didn't even know about!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Love this movie. Based on the book series of Edgar Rice Burroughs, well finished. Great actors, above all Taylor Kitsch and Willem Dafoe. The movie is wonderful, exciting, lovely, fascinating. The Location is amazing. It`s a movie for the whole familiy and you can watch it again and again. I'm excited what's going on with the sequel! The BlueRay 3D is excellent, high quality!
0307891372|5.0|This guide is huge, very comprehensive, and obsolete. They rereleased it with DLC information so buy that, not this if you have them.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|What an wonderful prelude to one of the Greatest movies of all times! I'm sure this generation can't appreciate what the Wizard of OZ meant to most of us growing up in the 60's.  It was a storybook film that was shown on television only once a year....there were no video tapes, DVD's of Netflix. The aniticpation for each showing of the Wizard of OZ was incredible, and everyone in the family watched it together, a much simpler time.  I thought James Franco played the perfect Wizard and the casting for OZ the Great and Powerful was brilliant. The storyline and cinematography were excellent, and the star of the film is an unexpected character.  With the ending providing the audience with much anticipation for the sequel, \\"the Wizard of OZ\\"! Its a wonderful film for the entire family, enjoy it.
0071766588|5.0|That is a perfect tool to get as much practice as you need before the TOEFL exam. I'm glad that I got the book. The book gives the idea and concept of whole steps of the exam. Everyone can have achieve the right level of the education. Great tool.
B006IVBSBU|4.0|I work in a major laboratory in the Pacific NW and everyone (including someone who had interned with the CDC just last year), told me that I needed to see this movie. It is based realistically on how the CDC and WHO would handle a major viral outbreak. I like the fact that The H1N1 virus was mentioned and their reaction to that. Most people thought that the CDC overreacted to the SARS outbreak but they clearly state that they would rather be guilty of overreacting than not treating any outbreak as seriously as it warrants. I feel that this movie is very true to life but the only thing I found lacking was a larger sense of the true chaotic impact that something like this would have not only to the public but to the medical community as well. Overall, though, an excellent movie.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|We vote that toy story 2 is better than the first film! How convenient to purchase on amazon and have it on my devices/ computer. Enjoy!
B000069HKH|5.0|I was only 7 years old when my Dad first purchased this, and although it was annoyingly overplayed at the time by him (Being the big Bruce fan that he is) i have learnt to appreciate it over time, it's great, i was more than happy to buy him another copy since his original got scratched.
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|Proof that real musical talent is timeless.  I heard enough of watered down &#34;rock&#34; & grunge grinding.  DP's new release is an oasis for classic rock fans.  Great keyboard groove.<br /><br />Drop the &#34;?&#34;, this release deserves two thumbs up!!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Very slow start builds to a running & mind-boggling WOW! Having to want for Part Two is going to be horribly LONG!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this game is the best cut the rope ive ever. seen if I could I would rate it OVER 9000!!!!!! because that's how good the game is I got it for my son and he loves the game it makes him so happy he will not let go
B006CC0YB0|3.0|yeesh. I was really looking forward to some good new Lanegan music. But this is more of the same only not as exciting, engaging, or evoquing either in music or words. Disapointing.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I love these movies like cartoons, but more like a real movie done like Polar Express. This is really cute! Just fun to watch and enjoy. They did this book well. TinTin and he dog snowy are really cute and the Captain is funny on an adventure till the end.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|There is so much going on in this movie! It is a wonderful snapshot at some of the early classical processing of the world around us. It is also a sickening gut wrencher at what some of the early Christians thought was right and pushed on others. So much of Jesus lost in such a short amount of time. Then you also have the master, slave, female facet happening at that time. This movie is a really good one for group discussions about classical thinking and curiosity, ancient Alexandrian history, the Zeus view of God at the time, the political struggles to come into religious favor, what happens to a culture when a religion becomes legalized for all, what happens when you twist scripture to work for your agenda. Excellent can of worms!! I wouldn't recommend it for children, it does have some sexual insinuation and a rape.
B00AP06III|5.0|All time favorites. I will watch them over and over when I'm bored to death. I will have all of them before long.
0345803485|5.0|It's strage to me. But as I read half the book I had to go to the bookstore & bought books 2&3. Well, it's not a good novel, but the author just knows how to write for girls to read.

B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|if you where to pick a game it would be this one and I would give it a nine out of ten if I had to pick but out of general it is awesome
125000098X|3.0|The last part of the story is quite different from the rest of the trilogy, the plot is too mafia oriented and the end is too abrupt
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I play quite often. It is a lot of fun. My grandson plays it as well. He is better at it that grandma is.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This will be great for those times I need something off the home PC. Easy to use, and three more words to fill out the review
B0091REZMW|4.0|Pretty cool game...seems almost too easy...but fun...having trouble connecting to fb though...like the different levels...havent gotten too far yet...hoping not to have to pay to continue.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This book offers fascinating insight into the changes wheat has undergone from hybridization/modification during the last half century and the insidious effects those changes have had on the human body. Although I appreciate the doctor's anecdotes of patients' medical transformations with the elimination of wheat from the diet, the book at times reads a bit gimmicky. Overall, the book highlights the reality that screwing with nature most often yields negative if not disastrous consequences.
B0035LJZ1Q|2.0|I liked the movie because Jonny Depp is fun, but it was too bloody and too predictable for my taste.
B0018OFN1S|5.0|This movie was an instant classic for me. Cars are exciting by themselves but this movie actually has a plot. All in all a definite five star rating!
B00BF124PC|5.0|Another Great movie and excellent work by Jessica Chastain! I love the movie and the supporting cast! I hope this CIA operative writes a thriller when she live the AGENCY! Thank all of for you for your service!<br />GOD BLESS AMERICA!

B007A2O3FO|5.0|This is a cool story and I love the way it is written and the way the story plays out on screen.  The actors are good ones, Maggie Smith is wonderful.  The young boy is someone I had never seen before and I will be watching to see if he does anything else.
0307341550|3.0|It read okay, I liked what the back of the book said but when actually reading the book ... well it wasn't as thrilling as I thought. I think it happens when you have a good imagination and the book just falls short of what you imagined. Sort of like reading a GOOD book then watching the movie. It never holds up to your imagination.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thought this might be boring because it is basically a man's journal while he is stranded on Mars.  However, it is written with lots of humor and the situations that he gets himself into and the ingenuity he uses to get himself out of those situations kept me totally intrigued the whole time.  I loved it!

0812992792|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son deserves all of the praise it has been getting--it is an excellent and imaginative novel that leaves the reader with much to think about, much to reflect on.  The titular main character is Jun Do, a North Korean man without much of a past. He grew up in an orphanage that his father ran and he has little memory of his mother.  The novel is forward looking, for the most part, focusing mainly on Jun Do's adult life, and what a life that is, and what Adam Johnson is able to do with that life!  He is a martial arts warrior, a kidnapper, a translator and then finally, an imposter who takes the place of a prominent North Korean.  He pines for a famous actress and then ultimately develops a relationship with her.  The novel jumps around in time, but the tone of the narration makes it easy to determine what point in time the narrative is focusing on and which characters.  In the end of the novel, the perspective shifts between that of Jun Do in his imposter's role, that of his interrogator and that of the propaganda version of his story.  The shifting narrative, particularly the propaganda, is simply brilliant, an examination of the power of stories and the power of words and the ability of writers and speakers to warp and twist the truth.  The story itself is fascinating and imaginative--and the ending is satisfying and well-done.  The Orphan Master's Son is a very strong work, very well done.  Enjoy!
B00AAKZPUK|5.0|I saw this when it came out in theaters (I was only a teen), and was riveted by it then; 38 years later and I still watch it over and over.  Sydney Pollack crafts an awesome tale of a CIA analyst (Robert Redford, who plays the part magnificently!) who \\"just reads books\\" (and ends up inadvertently getting his whole section killed; not a spoiler.....it's the very start of the movie), but gets drawn into a multilevel web of intra-CIA deceit and deception.  Max von Sydow, Cliff Robertson and Faye Dunaway all play their parts to perfection, making for a thriller that STILL stands the test of time after all these years.  If you're looking for a good 'ol fashioned CIA spy thriller, this movie is for you!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great story!  Great actors!  I have been waiting for a show like this to come on.  All three seasons are awesome!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is another in the seemingly endless series of woman-searching-for-missing grandmother/grandfather/mother/father/boyfriend/brother/sister/etc games.  I guess that's just a simple story line to hang a game on.  What I like about this one is that there is more puzzle solving and less hidden object search than most I've tried.  The puzzles are not super challenging but I'm not up for a huge challenge.  I usually play these games before I go to sleep, and I don't want anything so challenging that I lie awake all night pondering a solution :-) .  All I want is a bit of entertainment with decent artwork and this game fills the bill.
B0086213XW|5.0|Ms Williams is a wonderful actor and this story is great, not wonderful, but very entertaining.  Definitely worth a good look.

B008ZDC7M8|2.0|Some reviewers have panned Mr. Cousins' effort for its inaccurate dates and its mixing of the various time-spans into which the author has chosen to divide movie history.  But my immediate, continuing, and greatest distress in viewing the disks was the dreadful narration, in which every phrase and sentence is read as a question.  Not one actual declarative statement is uttered -- as if the scriptwriter's word-processor produces a question mark every time the period key is touched.  And this is all delivered at the same deadly, measured tempo, scene after scene, with no emotion or engagement whatsoever.  I don't know who financed this film, but the thing should never have gone out without at least semi-competent narration.<br /><br />On the plus side, and it takes a lot of plus to enable tolerating even a little of the narration, there are many scenes and film clips I hadn't seen before.  But since I was pressing the mute button most of the time, I didn't always catch their significance.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|The end is bad...so bad. I was happy until the third part of the book, after that chapter I think the book became in a bad book.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|I loved all the footage,the sound was amazing and it arrived in perfect condition. Loved the bonus material as well but i do wish the extra footage had english subtitles as i do not speak Finnish.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love Mitch Albom's writing. This book was an easy read. He drew me into the lives of a young &#34;father time&#34; and his wife. How he became the one to first begin counting. His curoisity became his undoing. The story interacts with two present day people. A young, sensitive teen and an old, dying rich man. It's a book that I may want to read again.
B001O03NCW|4.0|I saw this movie years ago and thought it was okay but nothing to write home about. When I saw the soundtrack album on sale on Amazon, I gave it a listen and discovered some fantastic bluegrass by legends such as Allison Krauss and Emmylou Harris. The true standout is Ralph Stanley singing &#34;O Death&#34; a capella, an incredibly haunting and gorgeous performance.

B007D2XSW0|1.0|Got this as FAOTD and it saved at one point. Now it doesn't. Removed it from my phone. From reading the reviews this seems to especially be an issue with Samsung phones. Buyer beware.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I liked the movie very much.. The actors were great and it gave a great historical background to the viewer.
B000H1RFKA|2.0|It's just not good.<br />Predictable and lame. There are so many other movies in this genre that are good.<br />This is at the bottom of the list.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I liked the movie very much but was surprised with the ending.  I would recommend it to others to watch ... Some great life lessons in it.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I received this watch sooner than i expected and was excited to get it. This is a very versatile watch that I can wear for work as well as casually around town. The retail price was $185 and I was able to purchase it for $65. So far it has worked perfectly and I would highly recommend.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|impossibly good to watch it all at one time -- wish I could do that for every season of every show!

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was challenging as well as extremely fun. Needless to say, it kept me wanting more.I'm very excited to see what else in store.
030758836X|2.0|It's been on the best-seller list forever, and on the library request list I was 367th in line, so I decided to buy it after reading the preview. I admit that it has engrossing, teasing, taunting, plot points (author Diane Chamberlain's words, spot on).<br /><br />I gave it such a low rating (between 2/3--the 3 only because it was hard to put down) as it has no redeeming depth, no empathetic characters, no heart tugging moments (any that are \\"real\\" at any rate) but like a bad accident, you keep looking. I say that it is skillfully manipulative because at first you don't like the husband, then you don't like the wife. It seems you were mistaken in your impressions of them as a person, which of course is intended by the writer, but it does keep your interest, although for this reader, even the ending wasn't satisfactory, albeit appropriate for these two quirky personalities. For those that might find profanity objectionable, this is right up there with the worse of them - the F word is used so often it has no impact after awhile, which of course is what its purpose is.<br /><br />Another thing that really bothered me was that the character Margo was called \\"Go\\" by her brother and sometimes (especially at the beginning of a sentence) it throws you off thinking Go is a word. I found this disruptive, many authors are doing that it seems, shortening real names to a ridiculous nickname, and it isn't necessary.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent storyline and characters.  Excellent acting and interaction.  Can't wait for more episodes!!!!  Well worth the time and expense to watch.
B009S33I68|4.0|I guess we forget just how we came into the the war that some folks didn't like. when we had come out of WW II and everyone was for backing the men and woman how went to serve their country and come home with Honor.<br /> Men called to serve and did their best.  &#34;A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CAN NOT STAND !!&#34;<br /><br />  The men and woman who served at this time were doing the job OUR country had asked them to do, only to find out they weren't<br />in good favor with  the radical views of the most newspapers who lead in this field<br />THANK YOU ALL VETERANS !!!
B000FCKIFU|5.0|It starts a little slow but once the characters are introduced and the plot develops, it is a great read.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I almost skipped opening day of Iron Man 3, but was able to clear the afternoon for my wife and I to go see ol' Shell Head in action for his third solo outing.<br /><br />We went to see it in IMAX 3D as I had a couple of free passes. While the 3D effect is very good, I didn't think it added much to the movie and wasn't nearly as effective as The Avengers was in 3D.<br /><br />Iron Man 3 runs around 2 hours (2 hours long when credits start to roll) and 15 minutes, but feels longer. If not for Robert Downey's ability to captivate an audience, this film may have been a complete bore. It has a decent story even if a bit incoherent, the special effects are excellent with tons of new Iron Man suits and gadgets, but the Iron Man action is quite sparse until the big finale.<br /><br />The trailers showed us Iron Man's arch enemy was going to be the main villain, but The Mandarin is completely wasted in the film and the only association with the character in the comic book is in name only.<br /><br />You would think this would be a huge disappointment, but once I realized the joke being played on us, I got over it and decided to just enjoy the film for what it is. The Mandarin does give the film a few laughs, but it would have been cool to have Iron Man fight another villain instead of variations of Iron Men like in the finale of the first two films.<br /><br />I'm sure there is going to be hell to pay from any Iron Man fan boys seeing this film and I don't blame them. I have gotten to a point where I am just happy to see quality super hero films regardless of such liberties....Life is short, go with it and relax guys.<br /><br />******SPOILER ALERT******<br /><br />All the main characters are back, but it seems like they are all conveniently \\"busy\\" Happy is in a coma after a run in with the super villain, Pepper is running Stark Industries and also has a run in with the super villain, Rhodes is now Iron Patriot  also has a run in with the super villain...yadda yadda yadda.......<br /><br />******* END OF SPOILER******<br /><br />If not for Downey this film would fall apart, but somehow it doesn't. I was interested throughout even if I wondered from time to time when the hell is Iron Man going to kick some A$$!<br /><br />For some reason in the world of super hero movies, the film makers think that we must give the super hero outrageous disadvantages and put them up against ridiculous odds.<br /><br />While this tactic may work for drama's sake, it is extremely frustrating for fans to have to watch our hero being continually beaten about all the time, Downey takes so much punishment in this outing that he barely keeps his Iron suit on for more than a minute at a time.<br /><br />Of course the end battle is spectacular and in my opinion the best of the three films in this department(one reason being, I'm sick of Iron Man fighting other Iron Men!). After the giant battle the ending is wrapped up quickly and is a little strange too as it leads us to believe that Iron Man is no more, at least as we know him. I doubt this is the case and we all know in the land of movies, no one is ever truly gone.......especially if there is big money to be made! They better secure Downey for future Iron Man appearences because he carried this film from start to finish!.....<br /><br />******* END OF SPOILER******<br /><br />If not for Downey this film would fall apart, but somehow it doesn't.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I thought that this movie was amazing! Great quality and played well. I literally am in love with this movie and would recommend it to everyone!
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|While Iron Man 2 may not be perfect, it is a very solid and fun sequel. Improvements include better action sequences and some great characters added to the franchise. Unfortunately there is a lot going on here and even though it isn't hard to follow, there isn't enough time to give each sub plot the proper screen time it deserves. Oddly enough for a super hero film, I think they could have edited some of the talky scenes down and added a little more Iron Man action.<br /><br />A good example of this is when we meet Natasha Romanova she isn't given much to do and I found myself wondering if she was going to be The Black Widow on screen. She is only in one action sequence (a great one with one of the funniest moments in the film) late in the movie and she and Nick Fury are really only in it to set up The Avengers movie. I'm not saying it should have been edited out, but there is only so much ground you can cover in two hours.<br /><br />Whiplash is played with gusto by Mickey Rourke adding some real menace to the role, but he doesn't get much screen time either and that seems to be this film's biggest flaw, no one but Tony Stark gets enough screen time.<br /><br />After the first encounter with Whiplash in Monaco on the race track, we don't really get a good dose of Iron man until the final battle, which means there is over an hour of time where there isn't that much action. Considering what I had read about this being an action packed film, I found it to be very talky. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because the characters are well developed and the actors are all really good here.<br /><br />The final battle is very good with some very cool Iron Man destruction and some nifty moves, but it's surprising and anti-climatic when Whiplash is defeated very quickly.<br /><br />In the first film, I thought the final battle was too long and in this one, it just seemed to end too abruptly. I'm not bashing this film in any way as it is a very fun film, but I think the story may have been a little too ambitious for one film.<br /><br />Overall I give Iron Man 2 a solid B (4 stars) and I think Favreau did a very good job all things considered. The 2 disc DVD is loaded and worth picking up, but the Blu Ray is were the armor really shines!may have been a little too ambitious for one film.<br /><br />Overall I give Iron Man 2 a solid B (4 stars) and I think Favreau did a very good job all things considered.

B000XUBFE2|2.0|I read the many raving reviews and was expecting an intriguing story with a different perspective on WWII Germany.  I did get somewhat of a different perspective, but that was it.  The writing style was a little annoying, with death interjecting and jumping ahead and then going back in the story.  Whatever metaphors the author may have been trying to interject, I didn't get them, especially with death and his colors.  I would have liked to hear more of what happened to Liesel after the war and how she ended up in Sydney.  It was a book I was glad to finally be done with.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Like most fans of Marvel Super Heroes, I couldn't wait to see this movie! So.......10 am on opening day back in 2008, I was sitting a the theater with my wife hoping not to be disappointed.......we were not! The film's opening scene gets your attention and then back pedals a few hours to fill in the blanks. This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where! Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man,  \\"ol' Shell head\\" whatever you prefer.... I knew his career was about to take a very big turn for the better after this film! I think he will forever be associated with this character. I can't see anyone else in the role now.<br /><br />Like the Spider-Man films, it's the characters who are the stars and that's what makes the FX and super hero stuff work so well. This is one of the best Superhero films since any of the Spider-Man films with superb specials effect and witty dialogue.I loved the little touches throughout for Marvel geeks like me. i.e.:  Tony Stark's cell phone ring was the theme song melody from the 1960's Iron Man cartoon,(totally cool)I love little things like this!<br /><br />'Iron Man' takes the heart of the 'Spider-Man' films and the believable technical aspects from 'Batman Begins' and comes up with one entertaining knock out of a movie!<br /><br />A compelling story, a great cast, superb special effects and most of all it's FUN! Like all superhero movies should be, if you haven't seen it, you're missing one of the best of the genre!<br /><br />The 2 disc DVD is excellent with tons of intereting bonus material, but the Blu Ray for picture and audio are the way to go.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I downloaded Magic puzzles this past April to my kindle fire, and I have not had any problems.  There are so many free puzzles to choose from I still haven't gotten through half of them.  A lot of the puzzles say that they are the real thing but in truth, they are just squares that you move around.  I like doing the hardest ones 288 pcs.<br />UPDATE>>> JULY 24,2013<br />OMG what did you people do???<br />My Kindle was not working properly so it had to be returned...I got a new one.  When I finished downloading the \\"Magic Puzzle\\" into the new Kindle, Low and behold my disbelief.<br />The new puzzles that come already installed are still beautiful.  It's the puzzle itself that you just ruined.<br />I loved doing the 288 pieces, now there are 280 and the pieces are larger.  I understand that some people may have had trouble with the smaller pieces. But did you have to make them so big??<br />The puzzle got smaller; it doesn't touch all the sides of the screen.  So you take 8 pieces away, and give us a smaller puzzle.  I still love magic puzzles just stop doing stupid changes.
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|One issue, two remixes of some songs, but no Rules of Nature? What is up with that yo? Oh well, despite the lack of one song, this is still an awesome get.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Very fussy consumer of electrical. Tried 3 pairs of wireless headsets including a $300 pair all got returned. These are great for gaming, listening to mp3s around the house while doing housework. Even have range to get outside the back door. They block outside noise quite a lot. They are great looking and very comfortable. I wouldnt like to treat them too rough as I have seen damaged pairs in my researched reviews. The 3 programmable buttons are great. Wish there were a couple more. Not sure if they can be hooked up to my Samsung 10.1 Tablet though, will have to do some more research. Battery life is amazing. Clarity and adjust is good for gaming is good. By far the best value for money wireless headset with boom mike.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|wasn't really interested in watching until heard it from a group of friends that it is worth renting, and i did. Great movie :)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved it.  Have read the book a few times and love the series.  This movie was as good as it gets when translating from prose to film.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|This is basically like Yahtzee as far as making combinations with dice rolls. I love that you can invite random players to play and it appears that it doesn't matter how many games you have going with however many people. It's addicting as all get out. I recommend this game!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|The action is good and the plot is just okay.  It's a nice ride.  Wouldn't see it a second time.

1594204217|5.0|It was very interesting to read \\"Cooked\\" shortly after writing my own cookbook, [[ASIN:B00A6F6NFK The Wholesome Breakfast Cookbook]].  For just when it is thought that mealtime can't get simpler than microwaving your dinner in the oven or picking up a bagel and coffee for breakfast, Pollan comes along and shows you how such an apparently simple decision can have profound consequences.  He brings in religion, gender, sociology, environmentalism, politics, etc. and shows you how complicated such a seemingly mundane decision really is.  But maybe that is why our food decisions can have such far reaching effects, because they are decisions that every one of us has to make every day of our lives.<br /><br />After the introduction, \\"Cooked\\" is divided into four parts representing grilling over fire, stove top cooking, baking, and fermentation.  When I first started reading, I did not expect to be much interested in the earth/fermentation section, but it actually proved to be one of the most interesting and thought-provoking sections of Pollan's book.  The whole concept of how our bodies need live-culture foods to be healthy is very interesting.<br /><br />One weakness of the book is that I am not sure how practical his ideas are.  I am a person who regularly cooks for my family, but I also have the time as I don't work outside the home.  As Pollan repeatedly states a lot of time and patience are required to cook at home.  And I completely agree with him.  As he says, cooking is not actually that difficult after you have practiced for a while, but it is a very time-consuming process.  Pollan is all for the whole family working on the cooking but I am not sure this will really be attainable by many.  Yes, there are some men who enjoy cooking, but in general they like the more dramatic cooking as Pollan discusses in the fire section of the book.  While I have personally known a couple where the husband and wife, both of whom worked, cooked in a beautifully synchronized manner and served absolutely delicious food; it takes a very strong commitment.  They spent hours cooking each evening together and also a lot of preparation time on the weekends.  It is great if it works for you, but I don't see it as that practical for many.<br /><br />However this in no way detracts from the value of the book.  It is a wonderful work as to be expected of Pollan.  It is entertaining, informative, and thought-provoking.  If you already cook, this book will affirm you in this choice and show you many benefits to your decision that you might now have been aware of as well as encourage you to branch out a bit more.  If you are not cooking much, it is hoped that this book will inspire you to give it a try.  As Pollan shows, the choice to cook or not cook has a much greater influence on our lives than most of us think.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This has been my bag for the last coupe of years and it's probably time to purchase a second.  Bag can be configured to different types of cameras and equipment.  Sturdy zippers, heavy padding.  You won't find a bag at this price.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is challenging. I love earning coins and people etc. I am also happy that the cities get changed. Every now and then. I have the ninjas and my favorite surf board is the shark. I Gog the game for free. What a deal.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I was expecting to find a mindless way to pass 30 minutes, I was surprised. I really got sucked in. I loved the three lead characters. I think most of us went to school with each of these characters. It was very relate able. The show is full of humor and full of heart. Thank you Amazon for offering the first 2 seasons on Prime. If you hadn't of I don't think I would of given this series a chance. I can't wait to check out season 3!
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|The plot was not very interesting.  I never really cared about what the result would be for the characters.  Characters not developed enough.
030758836X|3.0|This is an enjoyable fast read with some fun plot twists despite relatively<br />unlikable and unbelievable characters. In the credits, the author thanks one<br />person without whom she says she would be forever stuck at 88% completed with<br />the book. It would appear from the ending, that she really was stuck at 88% and<br />finally threw in the towel by just sticking on some shallow, inconsistent and<br />unbelievable but short finish just to be done with it. This could easily have<br />been a 4+ star book if only she'd taken the time to work through her writer's<br />block and create a meaningful ending.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|These books are a real treat.  I have read them over and over again.  It's amazing how much you pick up re-reading these books.  There is so much detail in every one.  I really hope he continues this series
1401937519|5.0|I have always been fascinated with the mysteries of life and death. The story of Ms. Moorjani's near death experience increased my belief that there is a Higher Power that is radiates love to this planet and its inhabitants.

B0034DGPEU|3.0|When I first began reading this book, I felt that her style was a bit amateur, undeveloped. However, the story sucked me in and I found myself looking forward to each new chapter, although some of it was a bit predictable. Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in plantation culture during the time of slavery.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is &#34;so&#34; Nicholas Sparks! Always love the fusion of characters in his stories. They always make me cry, but I always buy the next one.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This show is a gift; every thing about it has been perfect.<br /><br />The actors are all *so* good, who all bring so much to the already fantastic writing. I love that we have a chance to watch all of these relationships unfold, to see them and the characters at their beginnings, streets away from where we originally saw them (plus in a contemporary setting, which is fab). Then there's how so much of the first few episodes rely more on suggestion, rather than outright telling us some things. Subtle keeps the feel wonderfully sinister, unlike how being overtly brash about it could have. I am always thankful for a show that doesn't hold my hand.<br /><br />Visually, this show is simply gorgeous, somber but lovely at the same time. So much thought has gone into the sets and costuming, the way it's directed and shot, and good god all of the planning & prep work that goes into the long pig dishes pays off well.<br /><br />Of course there is some gore, obviously this is Hannibal, but it's presented in such artful ways. It's still horrifying, yet the aesthetics of it are intriguing, as is Will's method of seeing it.<br /><br />Dark, clever, and visually beautiful, this show is truly elegant horror. 10/10 would recommend.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I purchased and played the board game a few years ago.  I find it a very fun and challenging game, and this app is a great adaptation of that.  I own it on the Kindle Fire.<br />You get three &#34;bosses&#34; to play against with the free version.  Even playing the &#34;normal&#34; difficulty boss gives you about a 50% success rate.<br />The interface is great with no glitches, the game runs smooth.<br />My only complaint is that you have to pay to get additional bosses, and additional Heroes.  You get three bosses and about 18 heroes with no additional content, so it still gives you a lot of options to play with before getting bored.<br />Great little game.  Each game takes me 10-25 minutes to play.  Fun time-waster!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|was fun unroll I invested like $150 then it crashed!!!! and u cant play without investing this much money . Its a trap game DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!!??
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a fun game when your bored. I wish that the special characters lasted longer. I also like how the place always changes.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great book with a wild ending. At times it was a little drawn out and mundane, but overall it was fascinating. Definitely recommended to anyone who loves \\"piecing together\\" the big picture.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I just love action movies, with a bit of eye candy.......<br />Hopr they do another one, as the endings are all open
030746363X|1.0|Not like sexual photos.  Wish I sell it cause I won't  be reading it any at all.  I later heard that people only used the diet part which has a lot of good in it.  How can I sell it?
1449410243|1.0|I read a few pages, and gave it away. It wasn't as funny as expected.<br />I would not recommend it.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game.  Loved every minute.  Good story. Worth the price.  Graphics are wonderful. Had so much fun I could not put it down.
B0073TZ1AA|4.0|I have just started using it so I cannot give a comprehensive review.  However, it does what it says and I can envision how useful it could be in specific situations.

1878424319|3.0|Over the years, people in my circle have advised me to read this book.  For me, the book was kind of boring and dragged on a lot.  I have attempted to read this book through the end many times, but could never get through to the end.  The four agreements are great agreements to live by; I just think the cards are better because they serve as a small reminders to live by the agreements.  I have them posted in strategic places throughout my home.

B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. All of the actors acted so actorly. I would watch this again with a friend if I had any.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|When I bought this book I had just started hearing about it a few days before. Was not expecting much but in fact ended up loving it. Cassandra Clare it a very good writer. She does not drag on and on like many authors but instead builds up the story. I have just bought the rest of the series so that I can start to read them straight through. A++ Can not wait to see what happens next. Great read. Also looking forward to the movie in August, I love watching Jamie Campbell Bower. He was great in Sweeny Todd and has a wonderful voice.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. That it is based on a true story made it even more shocking. The fact that every single member of the family survived is absolutely amazing and nothing short of a miracle.
B00CDFWJIG|3.0|Beautiful Creatures was an okay movie. I was expecting a lot more but it was still pretty good. One thing that stood out the most though was the very bad southern accents from the cast. As someone from the south, I can say that it was just too fake. I did like Emmy Rossums (or however you spell her name) part though. I have never read the series so I do not know if it was anything like the books, the movie was an impulse buy.  Good to watch, just maybe not worth $14.99.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Many horror movies these days are high on the gore and low on complexity/good story. Reviews are subjective, and I know there are horror fans that like splatter flicks. A good tale that is a real keeper for me needs more than blood and shallow, uninteresting characters. Sinister not only has excellent acting, but a great story line.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|How can you go wrong ordering this? I love this and it was in great condition will order again for sure
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is really a great show and to me rather additive.  Some of the plot remains the same but each series shows a different aspect of how cases are handled.  My husband and I have watched Season 1 and now have finished 2 and it rather daunting to see how the judges act and even the lawyers themselves.  If you've ever had to seek legal counsel this show really throws a new light on the whole aspect of how your case may be handled.  Highly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Very good page turner. There were times I wish it was a little less obvious in some of the plot development, but for the most part the surprises are good and you're never quite sure what will happen next
0062213423|5.0|she loves one D she loved the book, she almost finish reading it is interesting and we need to find the ways so our kinds can read more instead of been in the computers or phones thank you again

B00AJAFNIA|1.0|This game is below average as far as mobile games go.<br />One reviewer stated it's better than angry birds, how fake can you get?<br />The 5 star reviews on this app are shameful and hilariously stupid, the developer thinks we're all idiots!<br />The developer needs to change the company name to Liquid Stupidity.<br />You get 1 star from me to offset the fake reviews.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this lame spyware over permissioned app.<br />It's really amazing these days just how many excuses developers will come up with while selling your information for the REAL PAYDAY!<br /><br />When mobile devices get more powerful with faster quad core processors you will start to see quality spyware detection and blocking capabilities, but Google and other app sellers won't let it on their sites because it's the secret cash cow that doesn't exist!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like seeing how Christian and Ana have evolved thru the three books. I like seeing how Christian has changed since meeting Ana, and how he has grown and learned to love.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one book that takes you to the edge,you never see the ending at all.LOVE the whole story,just never saw the end.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I JUST LOVE THIS SO VERY MUCH. I EVEN RECOMMENDED THIS AP TO MY NIECE,THE DAY AFTER I GOT IT,I DIDN'T EVEN TRY THE FREE VERSION FIRST. BECAUSE SOUNDED LIKE JUST WHAT I NEEDED. BECAUSE I WOULD BE PLAYING A GAME ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD AND IT WOULD JUST SHUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME. BUT NOW I KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY HOURS I HAVE TO PLAY OR SURF THE WEB. REALLY A GREAT PRODUCT. THANKS SO MUCH.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Ok so I luv draw something my friend used to play it so I started maybe in well last year. Then marmalade bug came and kept messing up my game. But that was a long time ago. This game only makes you put your email address on here but nothing else. I deleted this game when it kept having marmalade then it worked when I got it again.AWESOME GAME!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was amazing! I liked it a lot! I saw the movie and it was great! Good job, Yann!
B00APJLEGA|5.0|My kids watched it over and over. I rented it at first. I had no choice but to buy it for them.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|i have a ascend ii, and it ran i just had to turn down the quality. nice way to spy on your computer when not home, plus it auto logs you out so that is a perk for me.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|When I saw the title, i was intrigued and knew I must read this novel.  This is the first book I've red by the author, but it will not be the last!  When I had read only a few pages, I felt like this was a person  I'd love to have a conversation with.  Not only did Harold Fry learn many things about himself, I , the reader, learned much about myself.  Miss Joyce, please keep  these great books coming!!!! You have a loyal reader.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|I waited to see this movie and was happy about it and about Sandra Bullock's role.  I heard that the real story doesn't make the real &#34;Sandra&#34; look so good, but we don't know that story, only the movie which was a real tear jerker.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I'm a huge Shirley MacLaine fan, and will remain one. I'm a fan of what I see on screen. Sachi Parker paints a picture of what her mother is like off screen, and what her upbringing was like. It's the type of story I love, which is that human spirit can triumph over extreme adversity. The fact that her mom is famous is almost secondary, if you ask me. This book could have been published anonymously, and it would still have been worth a read.<br /><br />Sachi was raised in pretty horrible conditions, at least by my standards.  Two self-involved parents who really didn't care for or about her at all.  But, because the human spirit wants to be loved - especially by one's own parents - she just kept on trying to make them love her - over, and over, and over again.  It seems like she's finally figured out that she doesn't need their love, and more power to her!  I wish her well - she deserves it!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED FINDING NEMO ND NOW THERE'S A GAME SO THAT I CAN MEET ALL OF MY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS AGAIN
B00CDSVZHY|2.0|Gratuitous blood and violence - and that's all.  Tarantino's attempt to get back on top leaves him at the bottom.  I wish they would have shot up this movie like they shot up all the characters in it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love that this app encompasses the entire screen.  It works great for what I need it for and I would certainly recommended it!
B009GED3HS|1.0|This show is just not funny anymore.  All the characters appear to be ill-at-ease.  I can't believe the Robin character would give in to Barney's crap.
B000IJ79UW|4.0|Like Star Wars and several other blockbusters, John Williams' music adds most of the value.<br />Over the past 30+ years, John Williams has accounted for half of what's beautiful out of Hollywood.
1596680296|5.0|This book is a great companion for my knitting library. I have become addicted to knitting socks, I recommend this book
0385349831|5.0|First timer to read any of Paulo's books. This is one good read. First book that i have actually read in one day. It was that good. It makes you think of what you are doing NOW.<br />Paulo is definitely blessed as an author.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It works great on my Kindle Fire. No issues or problems since I've been using it and it was installed about 2 years ago.
B00CAJDUX8|5.0|This album has a very good beat! And some (not all) of the songs have a good message to them. I would recommend you buy the entire album because it is a much better deal!
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun and easy to play, but a little slow at times. hasn't been so slow I can't enjoy the game, its moreannoying than anything else.
B00992CF6W|5.0|He spent his own $7 on this game and plays it often.  He says, &#34;It's like the XBox edition, but has stuff the XBox doesn't have.&#34;<br />He has been very pleased with it.  No complaints.
1401229921|5.0|First of all, I love Jim Lee's art... He is hands down my favorite comics artist ever... Followed closely by Marc Silvestri and J. Scott Campbell.  So to have an entire hardcover book of Jim's pencils of storytelling is amazing.  If only more comic books did this.
0544002318|5.0|What an inspirational story.  I have slowly changed my diet and am seeing and feeling better than I have in a long time.  Going on a 10 mile run today in the rain.  My first 10 mile run in years....<br /><br />Jason

B000FBJFSC|3.0|it was a good book .. really showed how people survive in extreme poverty.. sad.  but the ending left you hanging.. and i like good endings.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its an awesome  game It is worth the money.I really like it you  should buy it too. Very  good game
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has often used Leadership as a theme, and as a question- probing what it really means to inspire and lead groups,  The Way of Kings does not fall short in this regard.  As a meditation on Leadership is is superb, exploring not only the qualities needed for successful leadership but also unflinchingly looking at the pitfalls and failures that occur.  Ultimately, the story is about Character, about the essential qualities of courage, integrity and loyalty that make a leader - be he a Brightlord in charge of tends of thousands or a slave in the bridge crews.
1250012570|5.0|It's the 80′s. Eleanor is the new girl who sticks out like a sore thumb. Park is Korean American, who does what he can not to stick out. So of course on Eleanor's first day she chooses the seat next to Park on the bus. Their relationship unravels very slowly, which sounds awful but was absolutely amazing. First, they don't speak with one another. Then Eleanor sneaks peeks at Park's comic books. Then he silently offers the books to her. Then they bond over music and next thing you know they're holding hands.<br /><br />I finished this book with a heavy heart. I could see the pages running out, feeling the ending of the book getting close and savoring every little bit I could. I'll be comepletely honest with you, this book tore me to shreds. I have a love/hate relationships with books where I can really identify with the characters and boy could I identify with these folks. Rainbow really nailed the voices for every single one of these characters. Every single scene felt real. I felt like I was sitting on that bus, that gym class and even Eleanor's crowded bedroom. I've never quite had the experience of actually feeling the emotions that the characters were going through as I read a book. With Eleanor and Park, I felt worry as Park did when he didn't want to be noticed with Eleanor. I felt his shame when he realized he had those feelings. I felt the wanting they had for each other when they wouldn't get to see one another all weekend.<br /><br />I've never so completely identified with a character, yet at the same time not. I loved getting to reminisce about the 80′s- the big hair, the bad clothing and the lack of all the technological gadgets we have today. I remember what a danger zone school could be; what a danger climbing onto the school bus could be and reading about Parks want to blend in reminded me all to well about what life was like in middle and high school. I couldn't wait to get a drivers license and a car so that I wouldn't have to go through the stress of daily bus life. I couldn't help but relive all the anxiety of my youth.<br /><br />This wasn't exactly the cheery book I thought it would be. Of course, a lot of adorable things happen. But there's also a lot of bad things happen between the pages of this book. I was left completely drained after finally reaching the end of the book. I'd been through the ringer emotionally. I feel like I've experienced every emotion possible. Nervousness, terror, glee, hope- all of them. If a book could ever be my spirit animal, this would be it. If I never read another book in my life, that's okay because I've read Eleanor and Park. It really is that good.<br /><br />If there's one book you read this year, I beg of you, please make it Eleanor and Park.ress of daily bus life. I couldn't help but relive all the anxiety of my youth.<br /><br />This wasn't exactly the cheery book I thought it would be. Of course, a lot of adorable things happen.

0380807343|5.0|Coraline is brilliant in its simplicity. Every sentence, every word, every dot has been weighted carefully and sprinkled over the storyline to create the Milky Way of wonder and horror. Nothing to take away, nothing to add. I caught myself on a thought that Coraline is not about what's written in it, but about what's left out. It's a tip of the iceberg, and the real story is underneath. The real story about the presence of love, even when we feel like it's absent.<br /><br />The story is very simple. A girl gets curious, opens the door she shouldn't open, goes where she shouldn't go, and gets entangled in a world that's so much like her own, and yet so much unlike it, complete with a set of parents, the house, the garden, and more. At first it looks perfect, just what she wished for, but it quickly turns sour, and then outright terrible. She goes about getting herself out  of this tangle with a deliberate determination that is only possessed by children. We, grownups, tend to think too much and to over-analyze things, before making any decision. We forget how we used to know that there is, in fact, a monster under our bed, and all you had to do to tame it was to put out a saucer of milk at night, before going to sleep. Why? We never questioned it. Perhaps because grandmother said so, or a friend suggested because it tamed his monster, or it was written in a book. We simply did it, and it simply worked.<br /><br />For this I will reread Coraline many times over, to slowly feel getting myself transported back into my childhood and experience the calm of never doubting myself and seeing things for what they are, even if they seem incredibly impossible at first.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This movie will keep you interested the whole time. It's excellent and Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely amazing. I love it.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|The first hitch is that at the end, they added the most ridiculous scene with his wife plugging her ears and I don't quite remember his ending stance, but it was more like a comedy add to a pretty serious movie.  It didn't fit.  The movie was also a bit raw in language.  The anger is understandable, if a person knows history well..................what a world we live in folks........
B009JZTOG8|5.0|i enjoy every episode but wish it was not soo expensive threw amazon 2 dollars an episode!!! kinda crazy right
B001CDWFPC|5.0|The contextual notes provide insight into Biblical history and context like no Bible I've ever seen. The hyperlinks are very easy to understand and navigate as well.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I have only seen the first show so not really sure about it.  It seems like it will be good.  I did enjoy the first show.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It's a great who done it....suspenseful with a twisted ending. Characters are very vivid and it is a fast read.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|A heavy-themed movie with a superior light touch. The acting was grand and the theme was so love-infused; a movie for the mature viewer.
B0037Z8SLI|5.0|Atul Gawande made an excellent job with this book. All ideas have real world examples and, although the process of creating a checklist is not exactly explained (I suppose it would take another 2-3 books), the core motivation and why should we create checklists for easing our minds and making tasks more effective and less prone to errors is very nicely presented.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|A great heady flick that kept me guessing. Definitely a modern movie that didn't use it's scandals to drive the suspense.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|love it and its free!! ads have separate window rather than take up window space during playtime..which is a good thing coz I'm on a 7inch screen. background music kind of soothing..although not sure if can change to some other music which can be annoying over time. can always shutoff and have radio instead. I like the soundeffects when u make a match. :D
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this game is really cool. especially all the suites and new lookes. I would buy this game if you like iron man
B00BHMF578|4.0|Very good overall but too many facial closeups of Ben Affleck (surprised!). Some scenes overdone. Wished it was about 1/2 hour shorter.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|this game could be better but of course they had to copy temple run in this situation. I expected a lot more
B000KIPT30|4.0|Not expensive, does what it says for 1/4 of the price of other headphone amps with the same capabilities.  Don't spend $100+ on a headphone amp.  My artists have never complained about it once.  Worth it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Great book. Easy read and helps you to really discover what you want from a marriage, or any relationship important to you. I feel empowered and motivated to love my spouse in his language.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We thoroughly have enjoyed this series reflecting on the English bygone era and lifestyle unknown to most. The quality is the highest and the story is captivating. We recently visited Newport RI and saw the mansions and heard the history of the parallel time and culture of America's affluent society and it was just incredible to see. Little did I know that the rich southern plantation owners of SC were the first mansion builders in Newport pre-Civil War and only after the war did the Northerners like the Vanderbilts occupy the area. Seeing Newport brought to life what we saw in Downton Abbey.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like it and it gives nice melodies, but it needs connection to run and does not play on background.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Neither the cover nor the title seem particularly interesting - after all, what in the world could this book possibly be about?  But our university selected this as the to-be-read book by all new freshmen. So it was worth a shot.<br /><br />Ready Player One turned out to be one of the best books I have read this year.  I am not into video games which is much of the action in the book.  But if you liked the classic book Ender's Game (is it a game or is it reality?) and are at least mildly interested in an alternate reality in SecondLife.com you should read this book.<br /><br />Fast-moving and fun - I read this in a weekend.  Highly recommend
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An easy to read series that pulls you in right away.  The story flows with very few slow moments.  The characters are intriguing and unpredictable. The first time I read the series, it was nearly impossible to put it down.  I own the series in hardback and on the kindle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Now I know why this book has over 10,000 reviews and such polarizing viewpoints.<br /><br />This book is a rather frightening portrayal of an obviously mismatched husband and wife, and the lengths they go to plot against each other.  The storyline flips back-and-forth between \\"Amy's\\" version and \\"Nick's\\" version of their marriage gone wrong.  She disappears, and he is framed for murder.  Enter police, family, neighbors, etc - you never really know who is telling the truth.<br /><br />I almost ditched this book after reading the first 10% of it.  In the beginning, Amy was a too-good-to-be-true wife and it was getting tedious.  Then the story took off after that and it became fascinating.<br /><br />The storytelling and plot are brilliant - no question.  I took off a star because it seemed too long to me.  As others have said, the ending was rather odd and abrupt - and I didn't feel any closure.  Maybe there will be a sequel?
B00APUTEBG|5.0|noticed Bruce Willis is in this BOOM I rent it. Did not disappoint and liked the NEW actors in this film...thanks to Bruce I would never have ordered it. Glad I did
B009GED3HS|5.0|Love this show. Well written, not dragged out. Keeps you wanting more. Can't wait to see what the rest of the season brings
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The third book in the series doesn't disappoint. Just when you think everything that has happened can happen, something else happens. I am fairly knowledgable about Greek Mythology, but I had not heard of some of these characters, which kept it interesting.
1597370045|4.0|I've always liked this story -- there's a lot to be learned -- and I look forward to listening as soon as I get a chance.  Thanks!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Exciting, and a worthy follow up to the Percy Jackson series. Kids (and some adults) will love it. Can't wait to read the next one.
0684800713|4.0|I've read the book about his life in Paris and surrounding area, and this book was like reading something that wasn't fiction -- it seems like it was almost autobiographical.  And Hemingway DOES use a lot of conversation to let us get acquainted with the characters in his stories.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|jewel games are my favorite,  and this game is so addictive. my pulse increases with the tear drop bonus game. big fish games are the best. keep on making them.........
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The plot of this story was not her predictable, leaving the reader guessing what happens next.  The title of this book was appropriate.  This is revealed as the plot undefined.
B008MM9630|5.0|I wish you could earn energy faster, but I still love it! I am also curious as to why it's called Fairy farm, when you are not a fairy and I haven't seen any!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Book did a good job of identifying how abuse may start and escalate before you reliaze it.  Could help you see abuse before you are or someone you know is caught in an abuse relationship.
B00C1BWLVC|3.0|The picture was great but there was just too much swearing for me!  Shame too...because it looked like a good movie but the language was NOT Good.<br /><br />If you Do Not like Swearing while Watching TV -- then you Will Not Like this movie at all.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Ordering movies online always make me nervous because i worry about whether it is truly new and whether it is bootlegged. All i know is that this movie was none of those. it was new, well packaged, came in its original Disney packaging and the disk had no scratches or mark. It was perfectly new.<br /><br />It arrived quite early *kudoos to the seller*<br /><br />This is truly a classic movie, one of Miyazaki's most wonderful and imaginative story! It is very enchanting filled with action, romance and magic!<br /><br />I am a fan and i am so glad to finally have this magnificent piece of art and entertainment in my collect....i am never loosing it! NEVER! LOL<br /><br />i recommend this movie to people of all ages for there is a lesson to be learned and knowledge to store. Besides it's humor, there is much to be said about courage and kindness breaching all boundaries. I love this movie!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Seriously fun,you can play easy to difficult. You don't have to make any purchases, I bought all the add-ons. I have no problems investing in something that is worth it. I hope the designer keeps adding new illnesses,even if they don't, there is plenty to keep you busy for a good long time. Reviews made me interested, maybe I can return the favor. It is not morbid, you are the illness and do what bacteria, viruses, etc do, you evolve. The humans are pretty good in the higher level, shutting you down.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Funny movie for the most part. This is exactly the way space aliens are. I've met many. They are all pretty cool other than they love brad Pitt.
B001GMQALY|3.0|The message of the movie is not clear. And at times it was a little boring. And for an erotic movie to  be boring, kind of says it all.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I just finished watching season 1 and bought season 2 on instant video to watch again. My girlfriend got me into watching this twisted horror drama and I love it! I can't wait for season 3.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Don't expect another Inglorious Basterds,but it's ok enough. Sadly, one of the most interesting characters dies. However, there is a happy ending. Woah, where was Quentin?
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I have only read a two or three of this authors books and I am starting to become a fan. This one continued to be as good as all the other ones I have enjoyed.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|This was such a pretentious, disgusting interpretation of a beloved Tolstoy classic. The director should be ashamed of himself. We rented it, made it 20 minutes and had to stop it because it was absolutely painful to watch. This is not a movie, it is a director who should never of been hired due to his utter lack of having never read the book. I can't get back that 20 minutes of life, but save yourself!
B000SLP4SE|4.0|It was action pack and fast moving. I kept my attention, and I really like Mark Wahlberg acting. It was a good movie.
0143122010|1.0|As we are in the process of wiping out the other remaining species, torturing in industrial agriculture the ones we keep for consumption, and otherwise setting the planet on fire, Pinker comes along to tell you what you want to hear: that we are improving, that we are good. The premise of the book is idiotic.
B009ME47H2|5.0|It is really easy to use  and works great . I have used it for many things I would recommend it
B0055MIS02|1.0|Since I have real funky, abnormal feet it was not comfortable for me....not enough cushion and straps not soft enough.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but it is very sad. It also leaves you wanting.<br />Would love to read a sequel.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was an amazing book. After the first couple chapters, it was almost impossible to put down. It doesn't slow down and has several twists.
B000FC146C|5.0|I enjoy the sweeping tale that last decades. Watching characters as children, to see how they came to be who they are as &#34;their&#34; part of the story reaches the climax, fascinates me. Growth and change told in time spans that make sense, seen rather than related -- it's a rich way to be able to tell a story.<br /><br />The Thorn Birds is a painful story. In my mind, I am plagued by what-ifs. What if Ralph had not fallen into Mary Carson's well-crafted web? What if he had done what he perhaps should have done after reading the second will? What if Meggie hadn't married? What if her husband had been fantastic instead of otherwise?<br /><br />What if Fee had, like, invested herself in her daughter as well as her sons?<br /><br />I was immersed in Australia all day yesterday, even knowing how it would end (as I did see the mini-series) and it was still captivating.<br /><br />This will be a re-read forever kind of book, even though the principal characters are, by and large, people I want to shake and dictate to. I guess that means they've been well-crafted. :)
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book will make you look at food differently and the people who are telling us to eat certain foods. Must read for everyone.
0736063684|5.0|This is a great book for both the veteran fitness guru and/or the beginner. There is a lot of good insight and information that shows you what exercises are targeting specific muscles.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The story was really quite good, but the author's need to be repetitive at times forced me to go from reading to skimming. It interrupted the flow of the story and is quite frustrating. But because the premise of the story was good, I needed to push through the author's challenging writing to see the story to the end.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book illustrates just how strong the element of denial can control us.  Being a parent can unfortunately blindsight otherwise rational people. Children with mental illness need medical intervention-not parental \\"protection\\". Pain does not get any better through denial -only worse.There is help available for people with diseases of the brain ( mental illness): and, I sincerly hope that this book vividly encourages anyone to get help.
0670026557|5.0|I found this book to be an outstanding introduction and summary of the art of giving and taking. The other reviews have done an excellent job summarizing the content, so I won't waste your time. However I want to disagree with several reviews that make potential readers feel as if there is only value in reading the first and last chapters. The examples presented in the middle chapters of the book are fascinating and provide case studies to support many of the salient points of the book. If I were to only read the first and last chapters, I would have come away from the book hungry.<br /><br />The burning unanswered question I have after reading this book is whether takers can shift and become givers (and unfortunately, vice versa). It isn't clear to me whether the underlying concepts of 'giving' and 'taking' are coded into individuals at a level that is tremendously difficult to alter.

1400069289|3.0|Its a good read that delves into the patterns that result in our daily lives as habits. Understanding the outcomes of what we do, whether we like them or want to change them, should stimulate the thinking of creating a change. In order to create such a change, we have to be able to analyze what urges are sensed in the brain, and how those urges create a need to act or react a certain way.<br />Power of Habit provides a easy to understand and applicable framework to construct such  a process. First to identify what changes we would like to create, back track that towards what patterns result in those outcomes, and how we can make or break the patterns.<br />It follows the simple logic of breaking 'insanity'.. if what you do does not change, then why would the result change?<br />Recommended read which applies logic to neurological patterns, which can stimulate basic decisions to suit a bigger impact.

B001DM1VXE|4.0|As one of the earlier films to explore the world of madness from a first-person perspective in a truly mind-bending fashion, Pi is a well done low-budget psychological thriller that was created on the cusp of a wildly popular new genre. Along with a handful of other films scattered throughout the 90's such as 12 Monkeys and The Fisher King, Pi helped pave the way for an explosion of incredible films. Fight Club, Memento, Donnie Darko and A Beautiful Mind, as well as director Aronofsky's next film Requiem For a Dream, to name just a few.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This was a lot better than I expected. It did have the usual unbelievable sequences common to all Hollywood action movies, but I didn't mind because it was fun to watch. It had the ingredients for a likeable and entertaining movie: Someone to like (Dr. King Schultz), someone to hate (Calvin Candie), the title character to route for whether you like him or not (Django), and a lot of gunfights, bloodshed, and overdone explosions. One test of a good movie is how long it seems vs. how long it is. This was a 2:45 movie that seemed more like 1:30.

He was a great leader but not as great as we may have thought.<br />A very readable page turning history book.<br />Thank you Lynne Olsen for a superb work.

B00274EYKY|5.0|This is one fantastic movie, and this is coming from someone who despises WFW with a commited undying ferver. This movie is as much about Randy the \\"RAM\\" as it is about Mickey Rourke. Certainly Mickey could truly identify with his character in this film. Randy is a broken man holding on to his glory days of the distant past and trying like hell to make his life better anyway he can. In the end Randy makes mistakes but he also fights to the bitter end to make something of himself. So has Mickey Rourke who once had a hot and smoking film career as one of Hollywood's top leading mean, then lost it all in the midst of tragedy, only to return to become an even better actor than he ever was. One only needs to see his 2 short minutes onscreen in the recent Sean Penn film 'The Pledge' to know this is a genuinly gifted actor that can't be tossed aside or forgotten. His appearance in that film is simply the best moment in the entire movie, and that is saying a great deal considering Jack Nicholson plays the main character in the movie, and Jack is superb in that movie as always. Mickey's short appearance is a testament to the genuine gift this actor has. Certainly Randy the RAM was the perfect role to help Rourke plant his feet firmly back in the movie business. He's simply brilliant in this role. While I had never been particularly a fan of Rourke's in the past, his recent perfornances in these two films and a few others has convinced me that Rourke is a textbook example of an actor who was once washed up only to return to prove to the world that he is better than he ever was. Much like the character he plays here. Marissa Tomei was simply brilliant as well. I loved this film, and certainly plan to see it again.
0765325950|5.0|A concise end to a long (relatively) journey. No gaps left. The resolution to this epic journey left no loose ends. Sanderson brilliantly brought to conclusion the Third Age.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Im rather boggled as to why so many people disliked this film. I think a major reason why is because its been described as some sort of supernatural thriller. Well nothing could be further from the truth. This is not a thriller at all. Nor is it even exciting or particularly ghostly. This is a film that explores the very real questions about death and what really happens to the living who have lost loved ones and not really about the dead. Personally I thought this film was absolutely brilliant. Here Director Clint Eastwood explores a subject far from what is appropraite for a director of his kind. I think the only way Eastwood could approach this story effectivly would be to lay his spiritual inhabitions totally naked and look death squarely in the eye. It seems throughout Eastwoods career he has always chosen wisely in his subjects. His body of work lays a blueprint that speaks about perfect human balance and clarity. Being Eastwood is now in his 80s and facing death not too far off himself, its as if Eastwood has seen a vision of death and wants to share it. Here Eastwood gives us much to think about. The most interesting thing here is that even though the movie revolves around death there is such a calming and full of life feeling about this story. Its as though Eastwood is saying that death is truly only the begining and that he knows there is literally nothing to fear about death. The entire film is so very tender and beautifully told. I loved it, and I think it puts a wonderful layer of frosting on a near 60 year career for this one of a kind human being. A marvel of a movie from start to finish.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|ok. so you might think I'll rate this app. well you are wrong. I wont give any stars because this game ducks.<br />sorry. I hate my spelling check thing.
B007NVJD7A|5.0|Hands down, one of the very best films I have seen in many years. An honest, powerful and genuinely realistic story about the beginings of the skinhead movement in England. I was amazed by this movie, simply amazed. The directing is some of the best I have seen in recent memory. The acting is some of the best I have seen in a very long time. This film is slow moving, but It's not a film that relies on action or brutality to tell it's story. It's a movie that has a real sense of realism, right down to the music, which clearly was particularly treated with special care. There are some underground songs in this film that I was very suprised to hear. Such as Strawberry Switchblade's 'Since Yesterday', and a very moving cover of The Smiths \\"Please Please, Please- let me get what I want\\" among other music tracks that add to the very realistic feel of this film. This film is certainly the most realistic rendering of the true skinhead movement. It has moments that will remind you of films like Romper Stomper and American History X. And while not nearly as violent as either, you'll come out of this feeling that you've seen an honest portrait of the skinhead movement. I can't say enough good things about this movie. And again the acting is way beyond fantastic. Highly recommended!!
B004XISI4A|4.0|Awesome extension to the series, hopefully we won't have to wait a million years for the next one like we did for this one
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|Finally a Danny Boyle film I can truly admire. I hated nearly everything he has done. Trainspotting was unique but I just couldn't deal with it's totally out there methods. I hated Slumdog Millionaire as well. I couldn't understand why it won best picture. The film was a huge mess as far as I was concerned. 28 days later was also a dissapointment to me. I didn't understand why it was singled out as some great zombie flick when many zombie movies delivered the goods so much more. But here Boyle manages to create a stunning film out of the most unlikely subject matter. I meam nearly the entire film takes place in a canyon gully where the main character has his arm pinned underneath a small bolder. How interesting could it possibly be? Sounds boring huh? It brings to mind that other film starring Ryan Reynolds about that guy trapped in a coffin. Oddly I ended up enjoying that film because it is quite a feat to create an interesting movie that takes place completely inside a coffin, but somehow it worked. Here is a similar story in that the main character is stuck with his arm pinned under a rock for nearly the entire film, but none the less there is a life affirming message as he struggles to survive in a situation that is truly horrible. What would you do if you had your arm pinned under a 600 pound bolder, with no realistic means of being able to set your self free? The clock is ticking and your runnig out of food and water. What are you willing to do to have the right to keep on living? I won't give away anything but this film was beautifully told and gives you a great deal to think about. I loved it. And thanks Danny Boyle for making a film I can finally admiire for a change.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series just keeps getting better. I can't wait for Entwined in You, and hate that it will be the last.
6305428298|5.0|This is one of those films that is a wonderful hidden Gem that passed under the radar. Jane Horrocks who plays the central character, LV is understated in her performance but it's the understatement that is truly brilliant. Her performance as an actress is truly spot on perfect and just brilllant. if that weren't enough she performs all the standard songs she sings her self, and I must say- perfectly. She does Judy Garland, Billy Holiday, and Marylin Monroe so well that it is truly a wonder to behold. This is a gifted actress with multiple talents, She is truly astonishing. One of those rare people that can act and can sing like no one else on earth. But the glory of this film doesn't stop there. LV's mother played by Brenda Blethyn is simply fantastic. And though her character is pretty despicable and a real nasty person, she steals the show in nearly every scene she's in. Out doing even the genious of her onscreen co-star Michael Caine, who is as always just brilliant. The film is not particularly a comedy, nor is it really a drama. It's one of those films that is very difficult to categorize, but it's downright a magical experience in the most unlikely manner. I loved this film, and thought Horrocks as LV was just one of the most incredible performances to come along in a very long time. Just a great film period!
B00846REIS|5.0|This is NOT 50 Shades... even though there are some similarities, this story goes it own way. It is also better written than the 50 Shades series, which I did enjoy.
B0012PDVQ2|4.0|I saw this in a theater in 70mm ultra widescreem the day it was released. It was truly an astonishing experience. Maybe not as good as Scott's previous Alien, but still one of those film classics that you only experience maybe a dozen times in your life. The special effects along with Vangelis's extraordinary score and Ridley Scott's impecable craftsmanship made this film a true wonder to behold. It still holds up to the test of time, but not quite as well as a few other films I can think of that are considered sci-fi classics. There was a time when I would have argued the opinion that this movie was an undeniable masterpiece, and maybe it was then, now I am still convinced it is one of the finest science fiction films ever made. Maybe not quite a masterpiece, but it still get's very close to that. I think anyone who see's this movie and hates it doesn't know what good classic cinema is really all about. And it can be argued that this movie is one of the best science fiction movies ever made and the impression would be greatly resonated by millions of fans. I think the final cut is the best cut. It looked and sounded splendid, so I agree with Ridley Scott on this point. If you love sci-fi or even classic hollywood blockbusters, you'd be hard pressed to find a better and more engaging film to pass the time with. It's a great, great film!!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This is a beautiful show to watch. Having to take a much of it at face value of it being entertainment, most of the costumes and settings are pretty historically accurate.<br /><br />This is not a history lesson however, and keep in mind that most of it is just speculation. But it was great fun to watch.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|This is not only one of the best remakes of a horror film I think I have ever seen but it is also one of the best remakes in recent memory of a foreign film I have seen. While the original Swedish film, Let The Right One In is superior in certain aspects, this one generally pays an honorable homage to it. This is solidly crafted movie making that stands well on its own. The atmosphere is thick, the score is sometimes gloriously haunting and also often beautiful, then downright terrifying. Indeed the music in this film deserves a lot of credit because it really helps set the tone for the movie and its better than most film scores I have heard in some time. Over all this version is much like the original, and while there are some sparse moments that were done better in the original I do think that certain aspects of this version were much more entertaining. In particular the boys who bully our main character. In this film they are far more menacing and hateful. They simply make much nastier bad guys. Some of the blood and gore is done better here as well. But director Matt Reeves does such a perfect job on this production I am interested in seeing some of his other work. This guy is a gifted director. I do have one minor gripe, and that is Chloe Moretz is not as unique or compelling as the original actress who played Eli, the vampire girl in the original film. Shes just not as creepy despite taking on an evil appearance occasionally while the vampire in the other movie didnt. But there is so much about this film that stands a good deal above most vampire films made over the past 20 years. I consider this one an instant classic, which is pretty suprising considering its a remake
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really like it.  I learn about an illness for which we should try to get a better treatment and also about the consequences on families affected by it.
B001LX2J22|1.0|I'm sorry but this rendering of the Thomas Harris novel was simply pathetic. I never read the book, and maybe if I had it would make a difference, but I doubt it would very much. The obvious reason being that Michael Mann's version of this under the name of Manhunter was simply far better. If you haven't seen that film and liked this one I'm pretty sure you'd find that one far superior even if it isn't possibly as true to the book once you had seen it. For one thing Ralph Fiennes is simply no match at all for the tooth ferry Tom Noonan played in Manhunter. His character was one of the creepisest villians ever commited to film. Fiennes seems bland and miscast, as does Kietal, Norton, and pretty much the entire cast. Norton as Graham just doesn't seem to fit anywhere near as well as Bill Peterson did in the original film. Even Dennis Farina as Crawford was more interesting than Kietel playing Crawford in this one. Manhunter was the original and it was pretty damned good. While Silence of the Lambs is the best in the list, I still think Manhunter takes second place followed by Hannibal. But it's kind of a tie. Hannibal was pretty great too, so I am not sure which one I liked better. But though this film has some decent moments, they are only reflected in the memory as cheeper attempts at the far more superior Manhunter. Michael Mann deserves some real credit for making that film, which came nearly a decade before anyone else though of it. But this film was simply totally forgettable and you will not like this retelling much at all if you saw Manhunter first, I'm pretty sure of that..
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory, so this DVD set is perfect because I can watch as many episodes that I want without any commercial interruptions! The cast is so funny - with the character of Sheldon being &#34;laugh-out-loud&#34; funny. All Big Bang Theory fans - (and there are millions of them!) should own at least one season on DVD. I plan to order all of the seasons on DVD when my budget allows. Great comedy!!
B00BUCW54Q|2.0|Though I'll admit I have not read the book(s), my judgement on the film and the final two star rating has to do with the film as it stands on it's own merits rather than an adaptation from a book. The film starts off extremely well, utilizing some slick film making for the opening sequence. Though this segment might be accused of borrowing some ideas from the opening sniper sequence from Dirt Harry, it's done extremely well and it get's you hooked to the core. The audience is treated to a senseless act of horrible murder on what appears to be just random people who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Perhaps a crazed gun nut just picking off anyone he so desires for the thrill of it. It's giving the audience something to hope for. I was thinking \\"Yep this is gonna be on great flick, if it keeps up the momentum\\".<br /><br />It's an excellent opening and it's done with expert creative technique. Having seen the trailer before hand, it gives the impression that this is likely to be not just one hell of a ride, but also a slick rendering of a solid action movie. The kind you often hope for but only comes along once in a great while. But as the characters are introduced and the plot begins to unfold, it begins to slow down a bit, then walks it's self into the territory of interesting investigative detective story. Searching for answers. \\"Who is Jack Reacher?\\", \\"Why these random murders?\\" \\"Who's in on it?\\" \\"Can we trust Reacher and how exactly does he fit in with all this?\\" It sets the tone and get's things set to the proper pitch. It leaves you wondering what might happen next when things really get moving. But sadly it starts it's engines here and there but never really get's moving.<br /><br />By that time Reacher teams up with a determined defense attorney to solve the crime, and this continues for a good 30 minutes before there is any further action at all, the first of which is a fight sequence, and one pretty typical of the usual macho B movie, or perhaps maybe with some stylish rendering less likely seen, but more usually not all that much endearing or worth remembering.<br />This fight sequence is short and to the point, and then from there on there is roughly yet another half hour of different characters investigating the evidence to determine what the motive was.<br /><br />So an hour into the film, almost half way through, there are two short typical moments with some action along with a lot of crime investigation sequences we've seen a million times in films and television. And in this case it plays like the kind we've all seen beatin' to death over and over again. Just about an hour and 10 minutes into the film there is a short and not particularly memorable car chase. Most chase sequences I've seen are a lot more energetic and exciting. It feels like it needs to be there and it seems to maybe be finally giving the audience what they paid for. But it's short lived and again not much worth remembering.<br /><br />Cruise plays this character with a reasonable style, along with a typical script, and it's simply by the numbers. It's also a typical performance and one that doesn't leave you really enjoying his acting even if it is right on key. By the 90 minute mark I was begining to tire of the film as it continued on it's very typical crime story pathway. The entire thing plays out almost like a slightly more polished episode of CSI or something. One reviewer here referenced Charley Varrick citing some simularities he felt existed in this film that wer ein tha one. CHarley Varrick is an underrated yet very well made crime story helmed by Dirty Harry director Don Siegel. I kept carefully looking this film over and couldn't make even the slightest connection to that film at all with anything in this movie. By chance though you might enjoy Charley Varrick, it's a classic, stylish and pretty gritty 70's heist movie starring Walter Matthau, Andy Robinson, who played Scorpio in Dirty Harry, and Joe Don Baker(Walking Tall(1973) (Cape Fear), excellent here as a mob hit man. It's definately a much better movie than this one, but then movies back then were often a lot better than ones made today, Even though Charley Varrick was not a major box office draw.<br /><br />Jack Reacher ended for me by the 100 minute mark. I shut it off. And I must tell you I purchased the HD version here for $14.99. Even though I paid full price for it I simply could not keep going. I \\"walked out\\" so to speak. So is it a bad movie? Not at all. It's well acted, still somewhat interesting, but I think to some degree the trailer ruined it for me. I'm not one of those that has to have action in order to enjoy a movie. I like films of all kinds, and am perfectly content with a solid drama with no sex, violence or language. This film simply plays out with a plot that I'm tired of seeing and doesn't have anything new to say. On top of it there isn't very much action for the majority of the film. It's pretty much mostly dialogue and not particularly interesting dialogue at that. One thing for certain, the trailer is misleading. It makes one believe this is going to be a well oiled action flick, and if you are one who is searcing this out for that reason you are likely to be painfully dissapointed.<br /><br />On the other hand if you prefer a typical crime investigation story you should enjoy this one, but I doubt even these individuals will come out of this one with much of anything worth noting or remembering.ing Tall(1973) (Cape Fear), excellent here as a mob hit man.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My husband and I shared this with my 82 year old mother. She actually started us on the series. Can not wait for the new season.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|it took a few episodes to really get into the rythem of this series. From the start anyway I was definately addicted. But by the end of seaon 1 I knew this is the kind of television that goes far beyond the typical material. It's powerful stuff. By season 2 of found my self so additcted that I couldn't watch less than 3 episodes at a time. I've seen every season of The Sopranos, and every season of 24, and up until I discovered this series I thought TV couldn't get any better, but I was definately wrong. This is riveting story tellling. The tension, realism, originality, and creative visuals makes this probably this best series I think I have ever seen on TV. At times gut wrenching. Other times brutally realistic. And at other times suprisingly heart touching. Never predictable and always absolutely top notch and exciting story telling. Its bold, powerful and simply unlike anything you've ever seen before. Season 1 was grade A, but season 2 is so completely astounding it's hard to imagine anything coming close to the masterful achievement this series had acomplished. It's simply breathtaking story telling I can't recommend enough., This rates as the best in television hands down. Fantastic visuals, incredible writing, and might I be as bold to say that Vince Gilligan is truly a gifted writer and director. This is simply an astounding achievement in film making, Be it television or motion pictures. I can't recommend this series enough.

B000GX8B9I|5.0|This film is an undeniable cinematic achievement. And one of the few directors that could pull it off could be counted on half of your ten fingers. Ridley Scott is truly one of the best directors in the world. Just look at his track record. Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator are just three fine examples of a genuinly gifted director. Here we have a very profound and realistic depiction of war. Brutal and powerful. And a cast of actors who are some of the best in the business. Eric Bana(Munich). Ewin McGreggor. Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Orlando Bloon, Sam Shephard, and several other well known actors give their all in this powerful unforgettable tragic true story about the american military involvement in the genocide that took place on Somalia. Intense, emotional, intensely graphic. An unforgettable film that is about as close to a masterpiece about war as Schindler's List has become. I can't recomened this film highly enough. It's simply unforgettable.
B0040Z9H5K|4.0|I just love watching these kinds of movies with my son. Great times! Memories made for ever. Cant wait for episode 3.
B0044WUQ3G|3.0|Ok from the get go this movie will not bring any suprises considering there is only so much a person can do if they are trapped in a ski lift chair. Either jump or attempt to make your way across the suspension wire above you to a vantage point where you can then make it to safe ground below. Both senarios are presented here. The first delivers what you might expect. Broken bones and no real way to go on further. The second is what I had a real problem with. One of the people stuck does indeed attempt to scale the wire above. But as the audience were supposed to swallow that this thick wire could cut through heavily padded winter gloves and then tear your hands apart. This idea simply doesnt work because the wire in question is pretty common and couldnt possibly cause such damage. Naturally the razor wire idea had to be written into the script or else our endangered survivalists could have easily escaped their peril much easier than what this film expects us to believe. In fact one of the three people subjected to this situation would have easily considered that option before attempting to jump some 60 feet below. Sounds like I didnt like this movie doesnt it? Well I did like it for what it was, but much of this story was pretty far fetched, that goes without saying. But none the less I found it very interesting anyway. Except for the predictable and weak character development and knowing the way this predicament could ever happen in the first place early on, I decided to suspend my expectations of a realistic story and just enjoy the ride. The result is pretty much what you could expect to see, but none the less I found this a somewhat interesting movie anyway. Its sort of brainless stuff for teenagers, but it served its purpose reasonably well anyway. Just a decent survival story but nothing special.
B008XFJEE2|3.0|after hearing about this movie for years I was disappointed that it really didn't seem to have a plot or I didn't get it!
B007NVJ7NU|4.0|What could have been an absolute masterpiece from start to finish becomes a story that gains momentum, then bogs down once you get an understanding about where its headed. As the film opens were introduced to what is by now some pretty familiar terriroty with the usual reality style camera in the first person sort of idea that is begining to get annoying. But that aside its done with some genuine style here that is hard to ignore. For example the camera becomes the main character to such an extent that even when he bats his eyes the camers flickers black for a fraction of a second each time. It lends to the depth of feeling like being within this persons skin. Once we realize this and are barely settled in, the subject we are part of begins using drugs, and as he gets high we see and hear everything he does. And I have to say its absolutely masterful to see this and hear it. Visuals and expression so impressive that its nearly as breathtaking and groundbreaking to experience as those miracles seen in Kubricks 2001 in 1968. It really is an amazing segment. Onward we go still within the first 30 minutes as the person we have become is killed. And we see his death from his perspective. And this too is absolutely stunning. powerful and intense. So much so that its miraculous movie making to say the least. But then things start to take a dive. Once his spirit leaves his body he takes a journey into the past and the present as he views moments from his life and the lives of his friends. The time line is in no particular order. But the film looses much of its beauty and mastery when it settles more into a typical flow of arial shots and endless repetitious scenes of sex, conversations that sort of leave the deep breathtaking artistry behind and flows back into a state of reality in an overall lackluster and boring remaining 2 hours about what someone experiences after death. And its not all that interesting on to the end.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great game with one exception.  Not enough bingo credits.  I would like to play longer but 17 credits per day are gone after 4 or 5 games.
B004JVXTL8|3.0|This was by no means a bad film. It's pretty much what you'd expect. No real surprises here. It's better than the original in some ways, and in others- not as good. One thing I did like is the way the film took time to build the paranormal activity to the point that it escaladed slowly so that it was believable. But at the same time it took too long. It felt like eternity. Once the real scary stuff beings it get's a little bit cheesy for my taste. And frankely the end seemed kind of stupid. And there was some clear reminders of the Blair Witch project. This is the kind of film that should scare people that are effected by silly horror films like Scream, but for harcore horror fans this will keep your attention but it's not going to blow you away. Most of what works about this film is what you fear is going to happen. In reality if your imagination is runing wild, what you imagine is probably a hundred times better than what actually happens. But on the other hand I don't anyone would expect a sequal like this to be anything but a total flop, and the film is far from that territory. I did in fact jump a couple of times, and a couple of scenes did creep me out a bit, but the portions of the film that are mean to really scare you just seem rather dumb.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Nothing more needs to be said WALL-E is great!  The movie is wonderful and the extras like BURN-E are hilarious.  Just wish this had the digital copy... can't seem to find the multipack with digital copy anywhere!
B004EAQNO4|4.0|I must admit that I did really enjoy this movie. I have never much liked most of Shyamalan's films, however in the case of this one though he didn't direct it, and that's probably a good thing. His films I think are all decent, especially The Sixth Sense and Signs, but none of them are extroardinary movies, but certainly good films. I think people expect too much of Shyamalan because The Sixth Sense in it's time was a pretty good movie, and during the time of it's release people weren't making thrillers much, so The Sixth Sense got more praise than it probably deserved. But Shyamalan does know how to write a good thriller and that is his true strong point. In essence the creative writer in a project is the most important ingredient. if the story isn't any good there isn't going to be a good script, and if the script isn't any good then the finished product will suffer no matter how good the director is, so Shyamalan should be taken seriously in that respect. As a director he's really very good at it but not up there with many of the best directors. However his story of the Devil trapped in an elevator with 4 other people was a great idea. The film is not particualryl terrifying, but there are some moments that are creepy, and there are some mild scares here and there. Another thing is I don't buy is the members who reviewed this said they figured out right away who the Devil was. There was no indication what so ever that the person who ended up being the actual Devil was in fact the beast. So there is no way they could have guessed it. No loose ends or clues at all to lead one to guess correctly. Perhaps a wild guess but that's just about it. I did enjoy the movie, but it's just the standard thriller with a little spiritual message thrown in at the end. Not really scary though. Also I thought the acting was just fine, not superior by any means but fairly good, despite what some have claimed.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Works great on my 3D TV and DVD is good also.<br />Movie is hilarious and my now 3 year old just had a NEMO themed birthday party because he likes it so much.<br />It might be a little &#34;intense&#34; for younger folks especially the opening scene but stick through it because it's worth it... for the kids and for parents too!
B0046UGSNS|5.0|Wow! All I can say is a big WOW! This movie was incredible! Just amazing! And this comment is coming from soneone who is a hardcore heterosexual, who admits to being as accepting as is humanly possible for a hardcore heterosexual to be of homosexuals. I was once a total homophobic many years ago, and I still simply can't understand why people end up being gay, but films such as this one, Philadelphia, Milk, and Brokeback Mountain have helped me understand what drives the feelings gay people have. And over the years I have become a much more open minded person. I have dozens of gay friends, and I admit that sometimes I still don't understand the entire gay reality, but one thing is for sure, I have learned that when two gay people love one another it is just as real and powerful as it would be between two heterosexuals who fall in love. This film examines what life is really like for a lesbian couple and the everyday problems they might have to endure. The acting in this film was simply incredible. Over the past three years I have become a huge huge huge fan of Mark Ruffallo. I fell in love with this guy after seeing him in an astounding performance in Zodiac. And after learning that he nearly died of a brain tumor and then survived unspeakable torment and then regained an even grander acting career, I discovered that here is a man who is truly an amazing human being. One of incredible determination and courage. He is now my most favorite actor. Also though Benning seemed to get all the attention for her amazing performance, The truth is Julianne Moore was just as good if not even better. I took notice of her when she had a small cameo as a doctor in The Fugitive. I had a feeling I would be seeing more of her back then and I guess I was correct. She has carved an impressive careeer in movies her self. Beyond that every performance in this film is just amazing. . I simply adored this movie and plan to see it again. Very highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Never had any problems with the game locking up or anything else. Passes the time especially while waiting at a DR.s appointment. If you have any waiting to do anywhere this is the game to play.
B006RXQ800|5.0|Martin Scorsese has created a timeless masterpiece in this film. it's an astounding piece of film making second to none. I must admit that when I saw this movie in the theater I was not entirely impressed with it and I don't exactly understand why. Since then I have seen the film more than 7 times and am blown away more and more with each viewing. It's a stroke of genious that Scorsese chose such an important and unlikely subject to make a film about. A film built around the true story about how amerca became what it is today. it's shocking just how brutal and bloody america once was during it's early days in NY city. There is nothing negative I can say about this film. Daniel Day Lewis was absolutely astonishing as the brutal dictator Bill the Butcher. Leo DeCaprio was simply brilliant as well. The art direction was simply beautifully done. The direction by Marty was simply beautifully done. The cinematograpghy, some of the very best I have seen. The script, absolutely incredible and intelligent as it get's, Every lead and supporting performance was impecable. This is a film worthy of the greatest respect, and a true story so enthralling you'll be simply amazed. This is top notch movie making at it''s most perfect and masterfull. If I could give this film 10 stars I would. It's an undeniable classic as far as I am concerned!
0385367783|5.0|This book was phenomenal! I can't stop listening to it, te truths are so deep and just what I needed as well. Must have for your spiritual collection.
B005KGPC4S|2.0|Well all in all this film was a strange tale. On one hand it was totally rediculous, and on the other hand it did have some redeaming qualities. The thing I did enjoy about this film, and the only thing really- is that the acting by nearly everyone was good to superb. Thanks mostly to Michael Parks, who plays a wacked out psychotic preacher to perfection. His role here topped only by his short appearance as a bordello owner in Kill Bill II, is simply fantastic. It's a little bit of a hammy peerformance, yet simply wonderful. Other than this and some pretty interesting acting by several cast members, this film is just plain silly. The story about a bunch of religious nit wits,unlike the actual Westboro Babtist bunch of fanatics, is simply stupid. You have on one hand some truly good veteran actos like Parks, John Goodman, and Kevin Pollack. And on the other hand you have one helluva mess of a movie, that is so heavy handed it should make you feel like a fool for putting the time into it in the first place. Unless of course your in the mood for total nonsense that happens to include some moments of really great acting. Otherwise, be warned in advance and do all you can to avoid this rediculous mess.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This app is great apart from the occasional pause. If you like Iron Man, you'll love this. Best game ever.
B004B32532|5.0|Bizzare, weird, grotesque, horrifying, terrifying, shocking, discusting, brutal, gory, creepy, nightmarish, twisted, macabre, beautiful, dazzling, dream-like, astonishing, sensual, sexual, tense, surreal, and most of all- astonishing! All these describe this totally unique and original masterpiece! So what is it like? The best way to describe is to imagine if you put in a little bit of Paul Morrisseys Blood for Dracula & Flesh for Frankenstein, then added in a little bit of Lynchs Eraserhead, then added in a little bit of Brownings Freaks, and then took your most bizzare nightmare and put it all together, youd have this movie. Youll never see anything even remotely like this. Its extremely weird, but also incredibly acted directed, and the whole experience is breathtaking. Be warned, its very violent at moments, and its not for the squeemish.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|A co-worker recommended this and I thank him. I'm off to book two. So looking forward to it. I highly recommend this book.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|Personally I think this film should by all rights go down in history as something of a minor classic for numerous obvious reasons. I mean, who ever considered that a movie that takes place entirely inside a wooden coffin could be so completely nail biting and truly entertaining? How on earth did the writer and director come up with this let alone put faith in the idea that it could work as a full length feature film? Indeed they must have figured this idea would be a major gamble, but their effort pays off here more than anyone could have expected. Ryan Reynolds, whom I have never heard of gives an ecxcellet performance as a man burried alive in this wooden box who must challenge his will to live and find a way to survive something thay seems impossible to survive. Hes subjected to a lot of mental torment in the process too. Hes buried with only a couple of cell phones, some light sticks, a flashlight and a zippo lighter. As he makes phone call after phone call he pleads with anyone who will listen as he runs out of time to help find and rescue him as he runs out of air and as sand spills in through cracks in the coffin hes been laid to rest in. He may have a chance however because he soon discovers that hes been placed there for ransom and if he does what his captors demand he may have a chance. If he can keep his cell phone battery alive long enough maybe the officials who are trying to find him can track his cellphone signal to where hes burried before its too late. Between Reynolds stellar performance,and Rodrigo CortÃ©ss slick direction that makes this story tense and suspensful, this film comes off as a real creepy ride. I got this on Bluray and I am happy I did, because though its very hard to imagine how a film that takes place entirely in a wooden box could ever be all that interesting, but its famtastic and intense all the way through and truly original too. Highly recommended!
B000BGR0OM|4.0|The Ultimate Collection is a 2005 Sony BMG greatest hits collection that contains such songs as Love is a Stranger, Missionary Man, Who's That Girl and Here Comes The Rain Again. Surprisingly the hit Sexcrime is not on this collection. The booklet contains all the lyrics and some neat photographs. For fans of Eurtythmics this is a must have. I am not so wild about the track Siters are doing it for themselves. Still a very good collection that could have been better by including Sexcrime and excluding Sisters Are.... Recommended. 4/5.
078322947X|4.0|One of Bill Friedkins lesser remember gems. While not s memorable as many of his other films like The Exorcist, The French Connection or To live in Die In LA, its till a tense and memorable thriller. A remake of another film on the same subject, Roy Schieder leads a cast of unknowns in this story about 4 criminals, all in hiding in south america to avoid extradition back to thier countries of origin for the crimes they commited. One is a terrorist. One is a small time crook hiding from the mob. One s a german assassin, and the last is on the lam for misapropriated funds from his successful business in France. These four men are hired to transport extremely explosive nitro glycerin across rough terrain, old bridges and rocky mountains, determined to deliver it for use 200 miles away. The film is filled with some nail biting edge of your seat moments, and it has a raw authentic feel much like the classic realism of Friedkins French connection. Its a grim film about men against nature who are thugs who really have nothing in common. But their will to succeed brings them together in order to accomplish the impossible task. A real memorable and pretty dark movie.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|An evening at the Vienna Opera House was well worth the wait (and long overdue). Hearing Joe perform many of his songs accousticaly  instead of the normal electric blues rock was inspiring. This album brings a whole new sound without losing the energy Joe is known for.
B0013O123Q|2.0|This film is yet another example of art house cinema taken to an ultra extreme in the name of art and frankley this sort of movie making is begining to get on my nerves. For the first 30 minuetes of this film the camera literally swirls in circles and takes the audience on a very freightening trip into the realms of sickness and depravity rarely ever experienced in cinema. The film opens as two men search for a violent rapist inside of an extreme gay night club called 'The Rectum'. Just from the name alone I knew this was going to be an extremely disturbing and shocking experience, and boy was it ever. The first half of this film is filled with so much sickness and depravity that you won't believe what your seeing. This is within the limited dizzy camera swirling about in the enviroment that gives the audience a very nightmarish visual gross-out as we see some of the most disturbing footage ever commited to film, including a man who's face is bashed to mush with a fire extinguisher, and it's truly very brutal and realistic. Further on we see the most frank and brutal rape scene ever filmed. It's the most disturbing rape scene ever made and it will shock you with it's careless treatment of rape. This movie shows us what lenghts humans are willing to go to in the name of film, and it's very sick and twisted. The sad thing about this movie is that the person commiting such sickness as horrible beating and anal rape is never found or pays for his crimes. The film shifts dramatically from one completely different style of directing to another more downbeat one and it makes no sense at all. The realism of the rapes and violence is very, very disturbing, so be warned. This is possibly the sickest movie ever made and it's very unsettling. Take my word for that, and skip it if you have any humanity left. This movie is very twisted and horrifying to experience. And it's ugliness makes me weep for the human race. But it's also very well crafted none the less.
B000PY52EU|3.0|Pretty good movie...before you buy it or watch it, black snake moan is a song in the movie so there.
B0036BK6MW|2.0|I don't get this movie at all. And I am beside myself as to why Sandra Bullock won the best actress oscar for this film. While this true story is inspiring, it feels like a hokey and cheeply made after school special, or even worse, one of the Disney movie that get's burried in the pile and forgotten in the midst of far better films on the subject. Bullock was simply splendid in her oscar winning role, but this is simply not a very demanding role at all. I just don't see what all the fuss was about. I was expecting something with more substance rather than the artificial 'Aww Shucks\\" feel of this movie. I like Bullock and I think Quiton Aron was very good in a typicl understated role. But this film just felt like a shoddy attempt at a feel good movie that isn't respectable in it's typical style. The film was a rather bland disapointment for me
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I have always been a fan of the hannibal story and this adaptation to tv is pretty good ! Enjoy the show!
B000ICXQHE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I'd give if five stars but for the Jodie Foster character.  I can't decide whether it was her or the character, but every time she appeared on screen I was annoyed for whatever reason.  Denzel, Owen and the rest were very, very good.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|As usual, this author has done a lot of research and applied his knowledge in an intriguing way whild dealing with certain historic events.  A lot creative situations with a smidgen of fact.  Nevertheless, a novel containing historic data woven into an intriguing story.
B000M4RG42|3.0|I hate it when movies are made with some sort of political agenda or messaging.  For me, until the Japanese stop insisting on a war crimes charge for our use of the atomic bomb, admit what they did fully and completely and begin teaching a true version of the war in the pacific in their schools, I'm not about to listen to any purportedly thoughtful propaganda that treats them as equals.<br /><br />This movie was all right, but the book is much better.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fantastic game the graphics are superb. You feel like the expierence is happening to you personally! I am still playing the game at this time and I will be disappointed when it ends! Please jump in to Maple Creek!!!!!!
B000TEUSJK|2.0|This, kids, it what happens when you give a pornagrapher a camera and let him try to be a historian.  If you want sex scenes, just use the fast forward.  I'm not nearly informed enough to say whether there's anything historically accurate about this movie; I saw one two star review that seemed to have that pretty well covered.  But as someone who was eighteen the year this debuted, the sensation it caused because of its lurid sex scenes swamped any pretense at trying to be a gift to the historical record.<br /><br />Watch it if you must, but prepare to be bored, underwhelmed or amused more than anything.
B007SGM084|4.0|I decided to give the book a try despite all the sexiness hype. Don't get me wrong I like a good sexy scene, but I prefer a good book. I was absolutely captivated! It was very relatable and I often felt completely engrossed in the story. I experienced a full range of emotions, from laughing out loud to wiping away tears. What a wonderful love story.
B000RLHDUM|4.0|I never saw the original in its entirety, but what little I saw of it didn't make me any more interested.  This movie just grabbed my attention and held it.<br /><br />I actually like the chemistry between Russo and Brosnan.  The locations used were wonderful.  I loved the scene in the glider.<br /><br />I did think there was one interesting device that I think is Pierce Brosnan's:  The final scene in the museum where he creates a diversion was very similar to the one he used in his HBO movie The Heist.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Russell Crowe gives his normal fine performance and give life to the movie.  He makes it happen for me.  Thanks.
B004J64QR4|5.0|I own the broadway soundtrack which I thought was good BUT the movie sountrack was even better.<br />I would recommend to musical lovers to invest in this cd
B000H5V8DG|4.0|One of my favorite all time shows...it's just that the ending wrap up in the final season gets a little too make-believe/far fetched/border line silly for me to give it the full 5 stars...
B004JHYRP4|5.0|Religious connotations bear review. I read this book over 20 years ago and am back for another go. All of Azimov's stuff is great in my opinion.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Gotta love the fact that there is at least one zombie scene in each episode, and the makeup and effects are awesome! Suspense keeps you on edge...
B005MMYL10|4.0|The main character looks like a surfer boy rather than a knight capable of wielding a sword like Excalibur and killing multible enemies in battle, some wearing armor and familiar with battle. But the reason I give it 4 stars is that all the other characters played their parts well, as another excellent fellow said previously. The upside is that you see good and evil being contested in unorthadox style and lots of actions, interesting characters and realistic scenery, not CGI in most cases, accurate depictions of weapons at the time, good film making and cimeatography. The downside is that it ends uncomplete and since no second season was made the fans and avid viewers are left hanging. It's no way to end a series that had so much promise. And the last two episodes pretty much suck compared to the rest.

B009JZTOG8|4.0|For brain candy with a bit of flare, Once Upon a Time has become my choice.  The acting is still rather overblown, but, so what? That's pretty much in keeping with the type of show - overblown, fantastical, silly, but with a touch of drama and intrigue. A nice show for fun, dramatic suspense without being overly dark for younger or sensitive viewers. The writers do a good job of revealing enough backstory each episode to keep viewers interested and to maintain story cohesion - a feat given the many characters and storylines.<br /><br />My only complaints? A wee bit too much of a focus on &#34;blood&#34; as &#34;family&#34; (say, for example, over adoption) and those hideous false eyelashes all the female leads wear. (Ugh.)
B00BF123WG|1.0|The Navy SEALS move slower than molasses. Slow. False account. Katheryn bigelow is not an Oscar worthy director. Don't watch.
B00BV859CY|4.0|Parts of this album show unequivocally that Rod Stewart has still got it.  He has always been a great singer with a uniquely brilliant voice and the skill and musicality to put a song over with real feeling, but some of his choice of material and production style has often made me wonder whether any of the old magic was still there.  In places on this album it certainly is.  It's variable material, but the good bits are really good.<br /><br />The album opens with a decent but pretty standard pop song, She Makes Me Happy which Rod lifts a bit above the ordinary, and in It's Over it's good to see that he has the dignity to sing about the end of a marriage rather than teenage heartbreak, but he shows that his real greatness is still there in Brighton Beach, a beautiful, deeply evocative song about the recall of first love.  It may not be the enduring masterpiece that I Don't Want To Talk About It is, for example, but it affects me nearly as deeply.<br /><br />I won't go through the entire album - there's a good variety of pop, dance and ballads most written by Stewart himself and often reflecting on ageing and times past.  Some bits are pretty ordinary, some are very good. I think the three bonus tracks are among the best here, by the way.  They're a little more bluesy and a little less produced which gives them a genuineness which I like a lot, and I think they're well worth the extra couple of quid.<br /><br />The thing that strikes me most strongly is that Rod sounds sincere throughout.  He never sounds as though he's going through the motions and even when the material isn't great, the band sounds fairly ordinary, the lyrics are pretty naff or the production is a bit schmaltzy (which is too often for me, I must say) he sings as though he really means it and manages to lift the whole thing well above the average.<br /><br />Rod Stewart has made some albums which I think would fall into the UN classification of Cruel And Unusual Punishments, so it's good to see that a truly great singer can still make a good record.  It certainly isn't up there with Every Picture Tells A Story, but it's not bad at all and has moments of brilliance.  Recommended.a truly great singer can still make a good record.

B00ADQCBEY|4.0|this is an exciting show I ,too many really blatant references to sex so I don't like my grandson to watch it with us.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a good hidden object game.  And the graphics are awesome. It played beautifully on my kindle fire. Only issue i have is that it was too short for the $. If we pay $5 for a game<br />it should last more than 1 day.
B000062XFG|5.0|I love it, and the plus of it, it was never opened. I just love Star Trek and I would tell anyone to by this season and many more.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Came across one of their songs while listening to Pandora radio and I had to stop what I was doing and look them up. After deciding to buy a cd/dvd combo of their latest album from their web site and having it sent from London I could not wait to get some of their music right away and since buying the cd gave me auto rip and was cheaper then buying just the mp3 I bought the CD. Loving it, even find myself humming the tunes during the day while I am out and about.
B0042816YK|5.0|I think this is a great Julia Roberts movie and my favorite Javier Bardem is excellent as usual, a must see.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|I really loved this book! Brims with compassion for human beings, although material would be enough for 5 full-length books!
B000W9399S|3.0|The path of this book seemed to move randomly from one scene to the next and by about half way through, I lost interest in the change. I like the style of writing enough but the story just didn't hold me.<br /><br />I've been looking really hard for an author that can hold my attention through their library of books. Perhaps I need to try other Terry Pratchett books.
B009IJJ712|4.0|As an avid fan of BBC's Sherlock, this was a hard sell. It's nowhere near as well written or acted but, it's still extremely enjoyable. For those of you who are skeptical, give it a try!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I heard all of the hoopla when this book was released.  Some of it was incredibly negative.  I'm so glad that I read it for myself!  Sandberg does a wonderful job of interspersing her personal experiences with facts.  She does this in a light, easy to read and comprehend format.  I truly enjoyed this book and felt myself nodding sooo many times while reading.<br />I actually texted my kids(daughters - 19 and 17 and and 14 year old son) the quote: \\"What would you do if you weren't afraid?\\".<br />I've got daughters that are at the beginning of their college careers.  I'm going out to buy each of them a copy of this book so that they can read and take back to their dorm rooms.  I'm hoping that they get their friends to read it also.
B007V4530A|5.0|I teach public speaking, and found myself checking off point after point in this handy little book. (We even seem to admire the same TED talk speakers). It's easy to read, short and sweet. Most importantly, it is not meant only for those who give TED talks - but for everyone who from time to time must get up in public and speak. Follow Donovan's advice and the audience will pay attention, appreciate you, and maybe even applaud!

B0027YUK98|5.0|This very well recorded set of the violin sonatas was released in 2009 and can be summarised as being unusually fresh and inspiring as a set and quite different to both the much praised and admired sets by Perlman/Ashkenazy and the Kremer/Argerich.<br /><br />The differences are largely a matter of scale and intent as briefly summarised as below:<br /><br />The Perlman/Ashkenazy set from the 1970s and now available as a moderately priced boxed set, is the most dramatic and openly powerful set offering large, big-boned performances with close and full-toned recordings to match. This comes over as a set of performances conceived on a large scale and would be very suitable for large concert halls with a need to project over large areas. The scale of the piano playing and recording far exceeds that of the instruments available to Beethoven at the time of composition.<br /><br />The Kremer/Argerich set is somewhat smaller in scale and not so 'Romantic' in style as the Perlman/Ashkenazy set. Instead of such an openly dramatic and powerful conception it offers a series of performances typically full of incident and incisive playing from both musicians. Flashes of dynamic and rhythmical detail leap out of a fairly closely miked recording that is more intimate in scale. This is a set that reflects the individual characteristics of the players being so full of closely observed incident and flashes of temperament. It would be easy to imagine this set being suitable for medium sized halls.<br /><br />The new Faust/Melnikov set being considered here, is conceived on a more intimate scale than either of the two rivals described above. Although the dynamic range is less than either of the other two, it misses nothing in terms of rhythmical or dynamic detail. It is as incisive as Kremer/Argerich but not so insistent. The drama that is underlined by Perlman/Ashkenazy is present but not so forcefully delivered. The performances are sensitive to everything that Beethoven has written but with a degree of intentional moderation. There is a strong sense of forward momentum but never over-driven. Everything is modified by a considerable use of light and shade and, additionally, the sense of dance permeates much of the faster music. By combining characteristics to be found in both the Ashkenazy/Perlman and the Argerich/Kremer sets but in a more moderate manner this set could be considered to be the best of all worlds.<br /><br />These performances by Faust and Melnikov stay within the boundaries of the 'Classical' period and, of the three sets, is probably the one that Beethoven himself would most closely identify with. This is a set of performances that is easy to imagine being played in a 'chamber' setting with a small but interested audience. It therefore seems ideal for home enjoyment and appreciation. The recording is a little less forward than either of the other two and this allows for a more relaxed listening experience.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that this set deserves to be given very serious consideration by potential purchasers either as an 'only' set or as part of a comparative collection.<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />A note to the anonymous negative voters:<br /><br />The voting system is specifically only about reviews being 'helpful' or 'unhelpful'<br />Goodness only knows what you find to be `unhelpful' about this review.<br /><br />A negative vote without reason is not helpful to anyone. It does not contribute in any useful way to discussion so no-one can learn from you.<br />If you have a different view or find the review 'unhelpful' then explain, giving your reasons, and share your views in the comment option as intended.<br /><br />Your opinion might then add to the total useful advice.moderation.

B00BIVN82M|1.0|Major Michael Buble fan, what happen with this CD I don't understand. Song selection while not the best, a good singer like Buble should have been able to make it work.<br />Checking credits I see many of the same people involved here worked on past CDs. I guess most the blame for this mess has to fall on the producer. It's hard to pick the worst song here with so much to pick from. Examples..\\"It's a beautiful day\\", music is to loud for the singing which is a problem with many of the song here, also the pace of the singing does'nt blend well with the music. \\"Something Stupid\\", one question..WHY? This worked for Sinatra as a novelty song because of his daughter, and even then is was a suprised hit. It is not a cover song. And what is up with Reese Witherspoon, did someone loose a bet. I don't get after recording this song and then play back why ANYBODY in the room thought this went well. I could go on but I wont. This CD is a waste of money.<br /><br />Past CDs bring back \\"Me and Mrs. Jones\\"...Magic, Boyz to Men, something new that worked very well. This group of \\"singers\\" that sang on this CD??????.<br /><br />His next CD must be great, needs to work with David Foster again, do some duets with people like Aretha, Barbra, Reba, Dolly, Annie Lennox, Bette Midler, Cher, George Straight. Try something like Sinatra did with his duets work with Steve and Eydie, Peggy Lee, Eydie Gorme.<br /><br />Michael Buble desperately needs new people working on his CD covers. Every CD looks the same.<br /><br />To the Michael Buble fans this is the CD you will listen to once or twice and then put on his old ones to enjoy Michael Buble music. Better yet skip this one and spend your money on someone new, try \\"Mandy Barnett\\" a VERY unknown/underrated country singer.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Season One just enthralled me with the scenery and the wonderful acting.  Now with Season Two some of the plot lines seem contrived and it has the feel of a soap opera rather than masterpiece theater.
B0054YHB8Q|5.0|Every song on this album is great.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  You never have to skip past a song, just leave it on play and let the harmonies and melodies stream through your brain!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a simple game but it does the job. Its very entertaining and helps kill time. Their isnt much technical things to talk about so this is it from me.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Good product, but higher priced than it should be for an adapter. Would have probably bought a third party product for cheaper if there was one. Regardless, I am glad I put down the $29 bucks to get ethernet on my MacBook Pro. I have an ASUS external monitor and for some reason it conflicts with my WiFi connection, slowing it down dramatically at times. I don't know why this happens, but I read on some of the internet forums about others having the same problem. The adapter fixes that.<br /><br />Keep in mind if you run an external monitor, you need two Thunderbolt ports to run the monitor and ethernet at the same time.
