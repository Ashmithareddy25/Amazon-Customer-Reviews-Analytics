1573225517|5.0|rob flemming is hornby's lovable loser in this fantastic novel.  any music junkie, or anyone who's ever had relationship problems will enjoy this book.  the first sentence will have you hooked:  \\"my desert-island, all-time, top five most memorable split-ups, in chronological order..\\" <br />    from there rob takes us on a tour of his life, music, and romantic failures.   the book if humorous, amd if nothing else, honest!    altough as a man i would not strive to be rob, a bit of him lives in all of us (especially music junkies).  every man could relate to this book. <br />     also highly reconmend the movie, john cusak plays the american version of rob to a tee!!!   and of course the soundtrack is excellent.....all MY top five are represented
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality is quite possibly Black Sabbath's career defining record. I know, some people will undoubtedly point to Paranoid as the \\"best\\" Sabbath record. However, over twenty years of listening to every cd in the Black Sabbath catalogue, I can say that Master of Reality (slightly) nudges Paranoid from the top spot. The album is absolutely flawless, starting with Sweet Leaf and it's sinister riff. After Forever is one of Sabbath's best songs and kicks the album up a notch. Embryo/Children of the Grave is simply a metal anthem. Orchard is a fantastic instrumental which leads into the two best Sabbath songs possibly ever recorded...Lord of this World has to be among the best songs Sabbath ever produced. Into the Void is my favorite Sabbath song. The band just completely dominates every facet of their instruments on this song. The two main riff's from Iommi truly embodies the spirit of Black Sabbath, they are just two of the most evil riffs you will ever hear.  Ozzy's vocals wail, Iommi goes riff crazy, Bill Ward adds machine gun fills and Geezer (as usual) nails the groove to the floor with his amazing bass playing. Over multiple listens I discovered Master of Reality to be not only Black Sabbath's best album but without question a cornerstone of the heavy metal bible. Highest Recommendation.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The new movie of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\" was a movie made to an excelent book. But beeing a great fan of J.K.Rowling, I have to admit that the third movie was much worse than the previous two. I think the new director, Alfonso Cuaron, made a serious error when trying to rewrite the story in his own fashion. It was clear to everyone that he won't be able to write as wonderfully as J.K.Rowling does. Alfonso Cuaron skipped too many episodes and made the movie look like series of peices. There is absolutely no connection between the scenes. The roles of characters are also reduced to be more simple. The part with  Harry's stag Patronus and the relationship of it to Harry's father was simply skiped, like so many other parts.    Some other reviewer mentioned the Muggle clothing in the Hogwarts School of Whitchcraft and Wizardry. Nonetheless, I feel that I must comment on it too. It startled and disappointed me...    Did anybody notice that the Hogwarts grounds were modified? I certainly did, to my great surprise. What for???    The following is my most important objection to the movie. The new actors don't look in the least like what the fans imagined them to be. Also their personalities are sometimes simplified, sometimes exadurated, not at all following the original plan. Sirius Black looks slightly hysterical when he announces that Scabbers is an animagus Peter Pettigrew. Where's his renowned bravery? When Remus Lupin fights the Dementors on Hogwarts Express, he is actually SMILING. Can you imagine a person smiling when he fights a Dementor? When Dumbledore welcomes the students to Hogwarts, he looks like Jesus Christ crucifyed on the cross. Speaking about Dumbledore...what can I say? No offence to the actor, but the new Dumbledore was terrible, simply ghastly. For some reason, he is always dressed in rags. Where are the handsome embroidered robes from the first two movies? Why does he have to pat Ron on his injured leg, if he knows that hurts him? It's not humorous, but foolish. When Harry and Hermione return to the hospital wing after setting Sirius free, they see Dumbledore-and does he acknowledge their heroic deed? NO!!! He simply says \\"what?\\" when Hermione declares \\"we did it!\\". \\"What\\", indeed!  In average, the movie was not very bad. It's just a pity that   the new director modified the plot. (Or should I say, \\"deleted the plot\\"?)If he followed J.K.Rowling's plan, the movie of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban would have been so much better.
B000002ARV|4.0|I've always preferred Johnny Winter's bluesier records, and this one is somewhat more rock n' roll and less Muddy Waters than, say, \\"White, Hot and Blue\\" or \\"The Progressive Blues Experiment\\". But it's certainly some of Johnny's best, toughest rock n' roll, and there is plenty of bluesy goodness here as well. The album opens with a really tough, hard-rocking cover of the classic \\"Rock Me Baby\\", and rocking numbers like \\"Can't You Feel It\\" and the two Stones covers are much more interesting than some of Winter's early rock n' roll covers.    Sure, there are a couple of slightly generic numbers here which never really get off the ground, like the superflous \\"Lucille\\" and the unimaginitive hard rock of \\"Tore Down\\", but most of what's here is really good, and very well executed, too. Johnny Winter's excursion into country rock on \\"Ain't Nothing To Me\\" is a bit unexpected, but it's quite enjoyable, and his laid-back vocals are very pleasant. And the country blues \\"Too Much Seconal\\" is pure Delta, rattling slide guitar and world-weary vocals.  The semi-acoustic slow rock ballad \\"Cheap Tequila\\" sounds a bit like late-70s Alice Cooper. The Rolling Stones' \\"Let It Bleed\\" is quite impossible to ruin, and Winter's rendition is really good. And the other Stones cover, a dense, gritty \\"Silver Train\\", swings and swaggers like you won't believe, some sizzling guitar parts and some great R&B piano.     This is not at the very top of my list as far as favourite Johnny Winter-albums go, but it has plenty of highlights nonetheless. Big riffs, lots of fiery solos, and, as usual, Winter stays well clear of all the meaningless shredding and finger-tapping that some show-off guitarists get by on.  Fans will want this one for sure. And yes, I know the headline of this review is a non sequitur. I had no idea what to write.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Simply brilliant - no need to rave on and on - Listen to Willie Nelson and Brother Ray put it all on the line, Van the Man give props to his idol, and Dianna Krall and Norah Jones worship at the altar of his greatness. And then listen to it again...
B0001AP12G|5.0|There is rap, and then there is hip-hop. With all of the junk rap out there featuring the Ying Yang Twins, Lil' Jon, & Juvenile, finally a popular hip-hop record that features even tighter beats, better hooks, and some of the most insightful, yet at the same time, relateable lyrics around. For years, MCs like Mos Def, Kweli, Common Sense, and others have sat idly on the sidelines as other more mainstream sounds and much less talented rappers dominated the charts with songs like \\"Shake Ya A**,\\" \\"Back That A** Up,\\" & \\"Get Low.\\" Now that Kanye is blowing up, maybe he can bring these other MCs out of the background with him and show nay-sayers of the rap genre that it is not solely about \\"money, drugs, and hoes.\\" <br />Kanye's CD is possibly the best hip-hop CD of 2004, up there with Jay-Z's \\"Black Album\\" and Kweli's CD \\"Quality.\\" Outside of the cuts that everyone knows, \\"Jesus Walks,\\" \\"Slow Jamz,\\" \\"Through the Wire,\\" & \\"All Falls Down,\\" every other track on this CD is worth listening to at least 100 times without taking it out of the CD player. \\"School Spirit\\" spits some great lines, \\"Last Call\\" is not only a great song, but also features his career story and how he came up if you continue listening. \\"Never Let You Down\\" with Jay-Z is just raw with a great beat and great flows by Jigga and Kanye. \\"Get 'Em High\\" has got to be my favorite cut though, featuring Common & Kweli, the song is just one Mos Def short from probably four of the top MCs on the planet.  <br />Buy this CD. If you have $15, and you don't have this CD, hit yourself in the face and then go buy it.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Yes, this film was an amazing and difficult-to-watch presentation of Jesus' last hours.  In the theatre, I cringed and cried and could not watch the whipping, understanding how it was true that my sins were why those blows were struck. BUT, this is a VERY Catholic presentation(I was raised Catholic, so I know first-hand)of the events and there are Scriptural inaccuracies in the film.  In and of itself, it is not an effective tool for evangelism as some will use it.  Watch it carefully, and do not let young children (under 13) watch it alone.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This CD has everything a true extrememetal fan loves.  Great guitaring(riffs and leads), pounding drums, great bass rythms, and clear powerful vocals.  The songs are good too.  I was not a huge fan of the As The Palaces Burn, but this album has changed my mind about Lamb of God.  Each song on this cd flows to the next one seamlessly. Many of the songs musically have a Meshuggah/Opeth(heavy Opeth/Deliverance cd) feel to them.  If you like this you will probably love the new Unearth, the soon to be realeased Shadows Fall.  I would say ShadowsFall, Unearth, Chimaira and LOG have the 4 top cd's of the past year, followed closely by Killswitch Engage, God Forbid, In Flames and Opeth.
B00028HBKM|2.0|This movie was mostly visual-with a lot of background music reminiscent of \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\"-which, in my opinion, surpasses this film in many ways. The dialogue, which was in another language-did not intensify this film-especially because the subtitles were practically non-existent. The story in the film was presented based on writings of a German nun who inspired Hitler,  and the book, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. So I cannot by any means see this film as \\"exactly the way it happened\\", as some are so eager to believe. People are so naive and searching for truth that they will take just about anything at face value.  <br /> The Passion was a bloodbath-but that is not the reason why I did not care for this film. The whole point of this film was to illustrate how much Jesus suffered for those who sinned. Jesus had no idea that a religion would be created as a result of his death-and that his image would be sold at Malls across the country, and churches built in his name. I love the story of Jesus, and am intrigued by how he died. However, that does not make me desire to place him on a higher level than myself, or anyone else. I am not a Christian, nor am I religious-because I think it makes people lack their own identity. Jesus was a simple man who taught kindness and truth. People should try and be more Jesus-like, rather than placing him on a pedestal and calling him their savior. There have been so many wonderful men and women to live and die-some of which were as awesome as Jesus. The only difference is that a whole branch of Judaism (Christianity) was created because of this man. Jesus believed in God-wouldn't it just make sense to believe what Jesus believed instead of twisting his teachings around and turning him into God? If anyone is sinning-it is The Christians-who are going against Jesus's philosophy.  I think that this movie is garbage that glorifies Christ-making him look like an ego-maniac rather than a messiah. I did not like theacting-and thought Jesus was portrayed as pompous. I thought Mel Gibson portrayed Jesus as he sees himself. I took this film and placed it in the same category as other films based on true events-but not a true story. I too, lost respect for Mel Gibson. I gave it 2 stars for inspiring me to think about how ridiculous the Christian religion really is. The only thing good that came out of Christianity was the story of Jesus, the symbolism, art and music.  <br />Children should not view this film.
B00006879E|1.0|I know this is pop music but I dont ever remember pop even sucking this much. When im flipping thru the channels and see VH1 on the only thing I see is this horrible band and John mayer and both make me want to vomit, it seems that horrible music is in style or something. Oh well in a couple of months there will be a new trend to bug the crap out of me.
B0002DB52M|4.0|It took me ages to get into this film, with its grim thesis, theatrical style and stark sets.  But, in the end, I was glad I stayed with it notwithstanding the deeply disturbing plot.  [WARNING - SPOILERS AHEAD.]  As the entire town by turns betrays and exploits the female fugitive who throws herself on its mercy, all the while justifying its actions with copious doses of self-righteous rationalization, one detects notes of abusive regimes from nazism to slavery.  But the most disturbing part about it to me was that, by the time the tables are turned and the victim makes her choice between forgiveness and revenge, I didn't want her to show forgiveness.  And even though her retribution was totally heartless, even sadistic, at some level it was satisfying.  Thus one is given insights into one's own potential for vindictiveness, and perhaps into the reason that human societies are burdened with bitter, centuries-old enmities that show no hope of being resolved.  In sum the film was a depressing but worthwhile effort.  The one thing that didn't really work for me were the depression-era photos shown with the credits, because while that was a sad and grim era in our country's history, the malign and cowardly behavior of the characters here reminded me more of the shameful way American citizens behaved toward the Japanese-Americans during WWII or towards suspected communists during or during the cold war.
B000002UJQ|5.0|After listening to The Bends feverishly for several years, I was confronted with OK Computer.  I loved The Bends too much.  It can never be surpassed, I said.  A friend said, \\"Buy OK Computer or I'll buy it for you...\\"  I avoided the record like the plague for a couple more years.  One day I broke down.  An album graced my ears. One of unbelievable polish.  Unbelievable musicianship.  Unreal creativity.  I was moved, I was stirred and I was shaken.  This is likely the most important record they had made up to this point.  A must-have.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I'm a bit late discovering this remarkable talent.  Heard Renee Olstead sing on Dave Letterman's show and ordered this CD the following morning.  Some earlier reviewers opined that Renee may be too young to properly interpret some of these standards.  Nonsense!  Her voice has just the perfect insouciant quality to spice up songs like \\"Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby?\\", \\"Slow Boat to China\\", and \\"Sentimental Journey\\".  The fact that she is only fifteen is simply that - a \\"fact\\".  The \\"truth\\" is in her unique vocal quality, perfect intonation, intelligent phrasing, and intuitive interpretations. If youth were a prohibition to talent, we wouldn't have \\"Lush Life\\", written by Billy Strayhorn when he was about 15, \\"Over the Rainbow\\" sung by Judy Garland at about the same age, and much of Mozart's repertoire. To my ear, Renee Olstead's vocal sound is reminiscent of the bright sauciness of Joannie Sommers and the kittenish quality of a young Eartha Kitt (think \\"Santa Baby\\").  Of course \\"What a Difference a Day Made\\" belongs to Dinah Washington, but wonderful songs deserve to be reinterpreted by someone as talented as Renee Olstead.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00005ATQI|5.0|This movie is very... enigmatic.  It is hard to pin down.  However, one thing is sure, it is a weary, bleary, and slow moving horror.  I think it is because of how slow it is that makes it classic.  It is the very slowness that is the essential factor here.  The lack of action allows the inner demons of the writer to seep out and interact with the cursed hotel.  Like a much better and more down to earth version of Event Horizon, the evil hotel gains knowledge of the inner demons of its inhabitants.  The hotel, of course, concentrates its efforts on the weakest and most unbalanced of the visitors, the writer played by Jack Nicholson.  Already driven to an insane existentialism by his twisted life, Nicholson's character proves easy prey for the evil that lurks in the Overlook Hotel.<br /><br />All in all, it's one of the most classic and slowly horrible of all horror films.  It is enigmatic, slightly obscure, dark and murky in its atmosphere.  Unlike \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" where Nicholson was the only sane person with any sense of direction, in \\"The Shining\\" he is truly, stark raving mad from the moment we first meet him.  Easy prey for the vicious, swirling, dark maw that is their destination.
B000001ELR|5.0|Why isn't this album spoken of highly? \\"Creatures of the Night\\" <br />is one of Kiss' best albums ever made. Track 1, \\"Creatures of the Night\\" is an awesome opener. Paul's melodic skills shine in \\"I still love you\\". \\"I love it loud\\" is a classic, but why is \\"Danger\\" so overlooked? \\"Danger\\" is by far the best track on this album I boldly say. It's the hardest song of all 9 tracks. It makes me wonder why even Kiss never performed this song on Alive 3 or Alive 4. \\"Danger\\" is right up there with \\"Love Gun\\" in my book as one of the greatest Kiss songs ever.
B00005JMAH|4.0|This was the best movie in the series and it was really cool! I'll probably get this when it comes to DVD and That one girl that plays Hermionie got really hot.
B000001ELP|3.0|The only songs I like are: <br /> <br />The Oath <br />World without Heroes and, <br />I <br /> <br />\\"I\\" being the best one. I'd put that on a geatest hit list also.
B00007E8O5|5.0|I was glad to have waited to pick up this double CD set, as it first was released as a 14 track single CD. Some of the songs reminded me of Alice-in-Chains, but that's to be expected. Some were purely Cantrell however, but I couldn't help but wonder if many of the songs were written about his old AIC partner, Layne Staley. There seemed to be a re-occuring theme running through the tracks, although songs didn't sound the same; faded glory, stardom can destroy, etc. This is an excellent piece of work, and I'm glad it was released as intended. There's a lot of dispair and tortured feelings going on in Degradation Trip, but it's all worth the musical value.
B000001ELB|3.0|It's a good selection of songs. I'd say the best tracks are: <br /> <br />1.Love Gun <br />2.God of Thunder <br />3.Detrot Rock City <br />4.Black Diamond <br />5.Beth <br />6.Strutter <br />
B000006O7C|5.0|When I first heard \\"Hallelujah,\\" I immediately rushed out and bought Grace, which played nonstop in my cd player for almost 2 months. One day I was browsing in the local Circuit City and found Sketches, which I had learned early were the unfinished tapes of Jeff's second album work. When I listened the first time, the songs were different than I expected; rawer, cut down, and far less polished and instrumental than Grace. As much as I love Grace, I actually love this cd more, especially the second disc's rougher tracks, such as \\"Haven't You Heard\\" and \\"I Know We Could Be So Happy Baby\\", which is my favorite Jeff Buckley song. The soulful \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\" and the sweet \\"Morning Theft\\" are also excellent. This is definitely a most worthwile album to add to a collection. Jeff's death is one of the most tragic events to happen to the music industry, moreso because he was not quite a rock-star and below the surface. If only things could have turned out differently....
B00006GFAB|3.0|My \\"The Very Best of Kiss\\" C.D would consist of the following songs: <br /> <br />1.Creatures of the Night-\\"Creatures of the Night\\" <br /> <br />2.Detriot Rock City-\\"Destroyer\\" <br /> <br />3.Deuce (live)-\\"Alive 3\\" <br /> <br />4.Lick it up-\\"Lick it up\\" <br /> <br />5.Beth-\\"Destroyer\\" <br /> <br />6.Killer-\\"Creatures of the Night\\" <br /> <br />7.Love Gun-\\"Love Gun\\" <br /> <br />8.I was made for lovin' you-\\"Dynasty\\" <br /> <br />9.Rocket Ride-\\"Alive 2\\" <br /> <br />10.Black Diamond-\\"Kiss\\" <br /> <br />11.Shout it out loud-\\"Destroyer\\" <br /> <br />12.I love it loud-\\"Creatures of the Night\\" <br /> <br />13.King of the night time world-\\"Destroyer\\" <br /> <br />14.Save your love-\\"Dynasty\\" <br /> <br />15.Danger-\\"Creatures of the Night\\" <br /> <br />16.Forever (live)-\\"Alive 3\\" <br /> <br />17.Nothin' to loose (live)-\\"Alive!\\" <br /> <br />18.Take me-\\"Rock and Roll Over\\" <br /> <br />19.God gave rock and roll to you (live)-\\"Alive 3\\" <br /> <br />20.Rock Bottom-\\"Dressed to kill\\" <br /> <br />21.Rock and Roll all Night-\\"Dressed to Kill\\" <br /> <br />*Bonus Track* Love Gun (live)-\\"Alive IV Symphony\\" <br /> <br />That would be a Kick@$& compilation.

B00006JDS4|4.0|when i sat down to watch this i was expecting a lot of gore done badly and even worse acting. it came as a pleasent suprise how good it was it only lost a star for a bit of a rushed ending but besides that i did enjoy it as a proper thriller and i would recommend it to a friend i think it sits above other exploit movies for it was done properly with good actors and script
B00006CXSS|5.0|HBO has distinguished itself with some really remarkable mini-series, such as \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" and this epic, moving history of Easy Company's participation in the European campaign of WWII.  Over the course of 10 episodes we learn quite a bit about the military experience due to the extraordinary attention to detail and the relationships between the soldiers.  The characters are revealed to us gradually and we have ample time to appreciate and begin to identify with them.  When one is injured or killed, we are affected as well and gain a small insight of what it must be like to lose a comrade in battle.    Compliments to the excellent cast, writers, and directors.  They have presented the story of Easy Company with respect and dedication./
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers is by far the Rolling Stones best album-- everybody knows the classics (Brown Sugar, Wild Horses, Bitch), but there's not one bad track on the whole album.  Sway and Moonlight Mile may the Stones' two most underrated songs.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is profound both musically and conceptually. Each song is beautiful, and could stand alone, but as a full album, each contributes to a grand musical journey that is experimental and lush.<br /><br />  Conceptually this album is meaningful to the issues of everyday life, even if it is about battling robots! It's about finding your own personal strength and courage in the face of opposition, and ultimately coming to peace with the universe.<br /><br />  Standout tracks are Fight Test, Yoshimi, Do you Realize, Summertime, All We have is now, etc. etc.  Actually every song is great. Just buy this album.
B0000057C5|5.0|This is a great album, well worth the money, and you'll find yourself listening to it over and over.  Especially number 4, \\"Bestrafe Mich,\\" punish me.  Oh, and \\"Du Hast\\" means both \\"You Have\\" and \\"You Hate,\\" only \\"You Hate\\" is spelled \\"Du Hat.\\"  It's intentionally ambiguous, that's the artistry in the song, even though grammatically in the sentence it functions as \\"You have.\\"  The album's full of stuff like that, and this is great for increasing your knowledge of German.  Have fun!
B00008973Q|1.0|- <br /> <br />I'm not going to sit here and write about the greatness of Kurosawa's RAN - it's pretty clear we're dealing with the lifetime masterwork of one of film's few true geniuses. <br /> <br />I want to talk about this \\"restored\\" transfer.  This butchered DVD presentation. <br /> <br />First, the aspect ratio is wrong, as has been mentioned before.  It's not wide enough.  We're obviously missing image on both sides of the screen. <br /> <br />But what bothers me is the color transfer.  The colors are indeed more vivid than previous transfers, and the image sharper, but the overall effect has the film looking brittle and highly over-saturated. <br /> <br />The contrast ratio is very high.  Much of the darker portions of the screen vanish into black.  I know there is image there - I've seen it.  But, the boneheads who supervised this \\"restoration\\" obviously have no clue how to do the job properly. <br /> <br />And, to top it off, this print was NOT struck from the original negative, but from a release print!  You can tell because the projectionist cue marks (those holes in the upper right of the frame) are on still on this film! <br /> <br />So, no original negative, bad transfer (the compression is very bad - lots of artifacts), bad color correction, wrong aspect ratio,.... <br /> <br />AND, no extras on the DVD. <br /> <br />Take your pick. <br /> <br />This is one film everyone who loves movies must own.  Yet, where do we go for a decent print? <br /> <br />You tell me. <br /> <br /> <br />-
B00005JMAH|5.0|If you want your Harry Potter movies to be all about Quidditch and cute children, then this movie is not for you.  If you were disappointed with the first two movies, and felt that they were watered down, family friendly nods to mediocrity, then this will be your favorite Potter movie to date.  <br />    The beauty of the Potter series lies in it's ability to work on two levels-one that is simple enough to engage smaller children and another that is complicated and layered enough in theme and content to absorb adults.  The first director neglected this concept-the second does not.  It may be said that this is partly due to the content of the first books, and the immaturity of the children themselves.  But in this movie the children are growing and realizing that evil is not always obvious and the good guys can be smelly and dirty and unpleasant. Dementors are created with true evil and fright in mind and Harry is allowed to be somewhat frustrated and cranky and very much like a real human boy trying to handle impending maturity and the fate of the world on his shoulders.  Hermione and Ron emerge as real people, not just plot devices and foils planted to enhance Harry's star quality.  The new director, and sadly not the next director, focused on the inherent darkness in the series and therefore made the light in them all the more tangible and true.  Kudos.  I just hope the next director, handling the teen years of Harry and the gang, will remember that heroes without a dark side are not heroes at all.
B00000JPH6|5.0|This is my favorite among Henson's movies. The story is exciting and a little unusual. Gen, our hero is on a quest to save the world from eternal evil, mediated by the Dark Crystal itself. Raised by the gentle Mystics (in a village that looks like the world of Myst), he must do his part to defeat the power-mad Skexes. The Mystics too, have a role to play in that defeat, hinted at throughout the movie but revealed only at the end.<br /><br />The wonder of this movie is in the visual richness of every scene. It's all live-action, but the fantasy action of Henson's imagination and artistry. The forests are alive with plant-like animals, animal-like plants, and other wonders. Along the way, he meets Ogra - a benign sorceress with speech habits like Yoda and a huge astronomical model later copied in the Tomb Raider movie. Every character is a unique creation, in personality and in appearance. Even the Skexes all differ in their unpleasantness. The Mystics, too, are each unique beings.<br /><br />As an aside, I made a trip to a zoo many years after seeing this the first time. A zoo docent showed us how a porcupine could walk on its hind legs. The waddle of that thick-bodied little animal was incredibly like the way the Mystics walked. Maybe coincidence, but I would prefer to think that Henson's creative mind drew on such sources to help sustain credulity in this incredible world.<br /><br />The Dark Crystal is a great kids' film, but may be a bit much for the very youngest. Don't wait for a kid though, adults can enjoy this on their own.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00005JMUA|5.0|As most movie lovers I have a pre-induced prejudice against sequels, but in this case KB II can't be regarded as a sequel, but the ending to the saga. The greatest part of breaking up the movie in two parts is that Tarentino could accomplish a considerable change in style, without creating a 'break' in the movie. The casting of Carradine in the part of Bill added that extra touch to the movie, especially in scenes such as the 'super hero' discussion. Michael Madsen's character also broke away from the slick-moving, kung-fu inspired characters of the other members of the deadly viper assassination squad. All in all it is one of the greatest movies ever made.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|This cd rocks! <br /> <br />1. Straight Out of Line: One of the best songs on the album. The military intro's kinda cool. 5/5 <br /> <br />2.

B0002V7ODI|2.0|Okay, I hope that if you plan on buying this copy of the film, you haven't already bought the special edition. I know I'm glad I didn't buy it yet, because I would be glad to get this copy. But still why do the studios feel compelled to release the director's cut when the special edition has been out for 3 months? Because they're all about the money. I loved Hellboy, and I'm sure many of you did too, but if you already bought the special edition save your money for something else.
B0000B0WVQ|3.0|what?  where is this studio located? The studio they recorded the album in...  In an apartment house with very thin walls? angry old people living next door? It seems like it. Otherwise i could not understand these girls. It seems like they cannot afford to play like they would like to play. That they have to be restrained, do their thing quietly, cautiously not to aggravate their nighbours. Or maybe there is a little baby next door, trying to go to sleep and girls of course are well-natured and do not want to disturb.  Or maybe they just had really bad hang-overs from the party last night while recording it.    TAKE THAT BIT BETWEEN YOUR TEETH and THIS DEED would surely rock a lot if they just turned the guitars louder a bit! BIRDS would rip your heart out, if they just managed to put a bit more soul in it! The instrumental YOU MAKE ME WEAK AT THE KNEES would make JIM O'ROURKE jealous, if they just managed to make it sound a bit more sincere. would would would.    I like indie-rock. And i want to be hip and listen to new cool things (like all of us, right). And i wanted to give this album five stars, but just couldn't. Sorry. It has content, but it is brought to us just too poorly. No wonder people like their live performances. Because concerts are usually held in a place, they don't have angry music-haters-neighbours next door. Right? For one track these girls even call the old tired neighbours in and recorded a song together with them (THE VALLEYS).  THE POWER went OUT and never came back?
B0002S65W2|1.0|Okay, honestly I loved this film. Even though it was slightly cliched as far as a story that had been told before in The Sixth Sense and Stir of Echoes, it was done very well, and remained slightly darker and more brutal than its predecessors. Here is my question: why, when this movie is less than a year old, do the creators of this film feel compelled to sell us a special edition version of this movie? I get tired of hearing of this, as they are doing the same thing with Pirates of the Carribean, and Club Dread. Why didn't they release the 2 disc edition when the movie first came to DVD. Honestly, if you've bought the single disc Gothika, save your money for a different movie, if you haven't bought it yet, go ahead and buy the 2-disc, I know I'll be saving my money though.

B0002XVQNU|2.0|Okay honestly, I liked this movie, but there are quite a few people out there that didn't care for the theatrical release of this movie. What makes Hollywood think they can rip people off by selling them a special edition less than 2 years after the original hit DVD. How greedy can Hollywood get. But then again, I guess we can see how greedy they are with the amount of SE and DC movies coming out this year less than a year after their original release.

B00006RINF|3.0|It's hard to tell the age of the average reviewer who discovers Lacuna Coil. It DOES seem that people forget that the mid to late 80's were FILLED with bands that had this same sound. Not that Lacuna Coil is BAD, it's quite good! But what is somewhat boring is that there is nothing new in their band's \\"sound\\".
B00027JZ3E|5.0|Some movies never get old. I dont know how many times I've seen this movie, but every single time I watch it, I never get bored. The same way I am with The Goonies or even Ferris Bueller.<br /><br />IF you've never seen this movie, it goes like this. A family of three, Mom (Diane Wiest) and two brothers Sam (Corey Haim) and Michael (Jason Patric), move to Cali from Arizona to start a new life after mom gets a divorce. Sam and Michael go to town to have some fun and split up. Michael ends up meeting a new group of friends with the leader being David (Kiefer Sutherland). Come to find out...this new group is a bunch of Vampires. Sam on the other hand goes to a comic book store and meets up with the owners who are called the Frog Brothers (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander). The Frog Brothers are more than just comic vendors though...they are also crazy/nutty/sloppy/funny Vampire Hunters.<br /><br />The story involves Michael and the group trying to kill the lead Vampire...who they dont know. Is it David? Or is it someone else?<br /><br />This isn't your average Vampire movie though. It's not really dark like most Vampire movies are. It's more fun than anything and sometimes even scary. Also I think they picked the PERFECT music for this movie.<br /><br />Jason Patric (Sleepers, Speed 2, Narc, and The Alamo) plays Michael really believable. It was fun watching his character change throughout the movie.<br /><br />Keifer Sutherland (Do I really need to name his roles?) has to be one of THE COOLEST Vampires I have ever seen. His voice and his acting in this movie just scream cool.<br /><br />Everybodys acting was good, but those two really just stood out.
B00007LTIL|5.0|This is truly a beautiful album--it's certainly in my Top 5.  Basically what you have to know about \\"American Beauty\\" is that if you've been hearing about the Grateful Dead your entire life but haven't gotten around to checking them out, this is where to start.  The majority of Deadheads would agree that they were never better in the studio than documented here.  It contains several of the best (and most well-known) songs in their entire catalogue, including \\"Sugar Magnolia,\\" \\"Friend of the Devil,\\" \\"Truckin',\\" and the cream of the crop: the absolutely gorgeous \\"Ripple\\" (with mandolin by David Grisman).  Furthermore, Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan was still alive, who was an important figure in the band's blues roots. <br />I think the 1969 live album, \\"Live/Dead\\" is just as musically accomplished as \\"American Beauty.\\"  However, many new listeners may find it much less accessible and won't be able to immediately digest a 23-minute version of \\"Dark Star.\\"  These are streamlined songs, most of them lasting about 4 minutes.  Again--if you're curious about the Grateful Dead, I assure you this is by far the best place to start.  And I assure you that you'll find it to be an amazing and beautiful contribution to music.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I like the way the movie is made. I like the way it makes you think. I like the cast. I like the acting. I like tthe plot. I do not like burning dogs. If you are a die hard dog person and get upset during My Dog Skip for the dog dying of OLD AGE, this is not the movie for you. If you think you can get over a cruel and horrible doggy death, this movie is one of the greater thrillers of the century.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Some of the other reviewers comment  about the contrived nature of the film.  the sequential addition of players on stage.   <br />Well. <br />The film  \\"Stop Making Sense\\"  was not a stand alone creation.  Talking Heads toured the production you see in the film.  I saw the concert on their tour stop in Binghamton, NY. A 5000 seat Hockey arena.  By that time in my life, i had see a number of arena rock concerts and had expectations. <br />Arriving at a general admission show, true believers were packed up front  and would usually have to endure the random opening act before their heroes arrive.  the norm was to have  multiple sets of equipment already arrayed on stage for the bands.  opening acts squeezed on the apron with little room to maneuver while the main event drum kits  and backdrops loomed above them implying the thunder to come.  Even with all the equipment set up in advance and (presumably) tested,  there were inevitable equipment glitches.  <br /> <br />How then to explain the empty stage with only a proscenuim arch?  had the band equipment bus broken down somewhere?  was there going to be a riot when they cancelled the show? <br />No. <br />what followed is pretty much exactly what you see in the film Jonathan Demme created.  the only real difference is that as an audience member, you were not required to focus on David Byrne, the way the film does.  As the band grew in size over the first half of the show, there were so many exciting performers to watch, Byrne was only 1 of the team .  in the film, he is  ( my only quibble) too much the focus.   <br />By the middle of the gig, i was convinced i wanted to marry one or both of the background singers, Lynn Mabry and Edna Holt.  They were mesmerizing to watch.   <br />And I was convinced that Alex Weir had the ideal gig as additional guitarist.  I watched him going through exhilirating stage moves, but unable to discern what part he was playing in the mix.  Friend and I even supposed he wasn't even pluggedin , but just there for the movement. No.  He really plays. <br />That concert is the one I rank highest in my pantheon.  All the more exciting to have the film come out and be so faithful to the concert i had loved.  I saw an Ad for  it playing in a city 50 miles away  and hopped on my motorcycle to see it.  To this day, every viewing is a revelation.
B000022TSH|3.0|I spent part of my summer in LA's Chinatown district, experiencing the sights and sounds and marking another check on my list of Chinatowns visited nationwide.  Almost as soon as I got home (meaning after I checked the mail, picked up the dog, turned the A/C down, and watered the plants), I rushed out to rent this film, eager to see one of my favorite vacation stops depicted on film. <br /> <br />Sadly, that was not the case.  I'm sure I would have liked the movie more, but the entire time I was thinking, \\"Hey, where's Chinatown?\\"  \\"I bet they're about to go to Chinatown now.\\" \\"Hey, what did that guy just say about Chinatown?\\"  My hope turned to sadness when the credits rolled, with mere fleeting frames of the fabled location.   <br /> <br />I'm not one to use 20/15 hindsight, but perhaps the director and writer could have chosen a better name for the film.  How about, \\"Where's the Water?\\"
B0002S94OS|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I am not a huge fan of the first two albums.  Each has 2 or 3 good songs, but for the most part the song writing was so-so and rather repetative for me.  Dubious production didn't really help either.  My buddy burned me a copy of this and WOW...I was really impressed.  Every song is strong, with actual melodies and some nice hooks.  The singing is still strong and mean, but much clearer.  You can understand what he is saying.  Not that that is such a big deal in the extreme metal scene, but I like it personally.  The production is also vastly improved.   I can't stop listening to this CD!  I highly reccommend it.

038572179X|5.0|Let me start by saying that I'm only 16 and I enjoyed this book immensely. My English AP class read this book over the summer and have already managed to spend a full week and half just debating the moral issues, the true depth of the character's atonement, the stunning prose, the unique structure, and more. <br /> <br />I'm going to be honest, I thought the book was horribly boring for the first 330 pages. The coda, however, 100% makes this book. The ending will shock you and have you calling one of your friends (or in my case, classmates) to discuss what the heck just happened. No matter how much you may hate and struggle though the first three parts, believe me, the ending makes it all worth while. <br /> <br />It's truly a work of genius. Bravo, McEwan. <br /> <br />Now, back to my paper on imagery.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Quite simply put, this is the greatest Rock and Roll Album of all time. Nothing comes close ! A template for all bands of today to look up to. In other words the Bible of Rock n Roll. <br />Check out the 25th aniversary re release this September with the lost Vanilla tapes.
0385336810|2.0|I'm a big fan of Becky Bloomwood and her Shopaholic adventures, but I thought Sophie Kinsella was coasting on her reputation in Can You Keep a Secret (and it appears to be working, given the number of rave reviews I'm seeing). I found Emma to be not-too-bright and not-too-interesting. Ditto for her love interest, who seems much too clueless to be a successful tycoon. Also, I had enjoyed the first-person perspective in Shopaholic, where we could get into Becky's wonderfully zany and creative mind. In this one, Emma never comes alive in a believable or sympathetic way. I agree with a previous reviewer that this book will disappoint those who expect both wit and intelligence in their chick lit.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I, a neo-feminist if there ever was one, award \\"The Passion\\" 5 stars as a showing of fearless faith on the part of Mr. Gibson.  I hesitated in doing so, because simply this movie is just that... a movie.  I'm a white woman, yet I can relate to people of most races (I've been called an \\"honorary woman of color\\" by several black and mixed friends).  Despite all this, I am troubled by a white man (Mr. James Caviezel) portraying the greatest Man to walk the earth:  Jesus Crhist.  The backstory is well-known by now, Gibson was forced (by the distributor) into casting a white man to play Jesus.  He should've stood his ground, but I can't blame him for caving in.  I've been involved in show business for most of my life, and I realize that in smalltown U.S.A., a white Jesus plays better in the multiplexes. <br /> <br />But the movie is worthy, though exceedingly (and unrealistically) violent.  I understand that Mr. Gibson was filled with passion while creating this masterwork, but even he should've exercised some restraint.  Also, the foreign-language soundtrack was a bit much.  The DVD version should have offered a dubbed English track.

B000002UAX|5.0|Diversity, experimentation, versatility, originality , complexity , lot of great songs in the first double album of the history, first one also wich sleeve is tottaly white, no photos, no images music speaks for itself, a group collaboration but individual ideas, an album integrated for solo artists for the firts time but working together as ussual , can we understand such paradox???? and despite it all, the best album the Beatles recorded in their career , blues, Hard Rock, country, bluegrass, all kind of styles, i love this double album since im 9 years old and still love it <br />HM
B0002I831S|5.0|Even to the millions who dislike it (and the media that seems to love making fans look like losers whenever a convention comes to town), Star Trek is an unavoidable icon of popular culture, surpassed perhaps only by Star Wars, Mickey Mouse, and Bugs Bunny. Its technology (tricorders, communicators, and even the beds in sickbay) have become science fact over the years, with much of the rest of Star Trek's devices poised to someday join that select group of now-real items. Episode plots (\\"Mirror, Mirror\\", for one) and quotes (\\"He's dead, Jim.\\") are part of the lexicon of the world. <br /> <br />So, now, finally, we see the original series arrive on DVD in season set form (with its sequel series, the widely underrated Filmation animated series, waiting in the wings for a 2005 DVD release). Thanks to the prior DVD release and the Sci-Fi Channel reruns, the series has already been restored to a pristine state (though the processing methods used in effects shots would imply otherwise). A strong Dolby 5.1 soundtrack and a number of special features round out the meat of the set. <br /> <br />For the uninitiated, Season 1 includes a number of classic episodes, as well as a number of \\"firsts\\". The big lure, of course, is \\"City on the Edge of Forever\\", undeniably the series' best episode (and quite possibly the most controversial episode of all the Treks, as well, thanks to the changes made to the original script in order for it to reach broadcast), \\"Arena\\" (which features the famous Gorn, a big 'n nasty lizard), \\"The Menagerie\\" (the famed two-part episode), \\"Dagger of the Mind\\" (the first episode featuring the Vulcan Mind Meld, and also subject to a parody/retelling on South Park a few years back), \\"The Enemy Within\\" (the \\"evil Kirk\\" episode, and the birthplace of the Vulcan Nerve Pinch and \\"He's dead, Jim\\" line), \\"The Naked Time\\", \\"This Side of Paradise\\", and \\"Space Seed\\", the now-infamous episode featuring Ricardo Montalban as Khan. (And I've left a few out, too.) <br /> <br />Of course, the series is now considered extremely cheesy, particularly the dated (but still serviceable) special effects. However, this show is still very smart, even some 40 years later. And, as stated before, these episodes (and many of the moments therein) are *extremely* famous. However, there are still no episode commentaries, save for a handful of text commentaries by Michael and Denise Okuda (the de facto continuity gods of the Star Trek universe). Also, the effects shots still look, and will always look like utter garbage due to the filming techniques used, with lots of dirt, scratches, and grain. Others will decry Paramount's blatant \\"double dipping\\", the price and the rather shallow special features, but there's little doubt that this set is worth every penny.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I'll keep this short... <br /> <br />This is a VERY good film, the acting superb. <br /> <br />This is not an anti-jew movie, just the last hours of Christ as told in the gospels. <br /> <br />This is a movie the like of Schindlers list, not an entertaining movie but an important one.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I simply could not believe my ears that this was an Alan Parson recording. After all the years of producing albums with wonderful melodies, I was left stuned by my disapointment at this effort. The new instumentals are almost devoid of melody or buried under techo noise. The reworked old stuff vastly inferior to the original. The vocals..well to tell the truth, I don't remember much about them as nothing could save this \\"work\\". If you're as big a fan as I am, you will ignore this and buy it anyway, but this is not anything like he has done before and I pray like anything he will do again.
B000001G5H|5.0|The majority of professionals, music lovers and music critics agree that Pollini's interpretation of Chopin Etudes is without match. Find our for yourself.  If you do not yet own this CD, you are one of the the few Chopin lovers still left out, so do not waste any more time. Do not listen to the ones who say Pollini \\"plays coldly\\" or \\"lacks musicality\\" because this is nonesense, this man happens to be capable not only of superb technical performances, but surely of some of the most haunting musicality around.  Pollini is the son of one of Italy's  celebtrated architects, and it is true that some of his recordings may sometimes sacrifice color for a deeper sense of structure, but not on this recording: the Etudes have never been more interestingly played than this.
B00009Y2K9|2.0|if you loved the buena vista social club you'll likely cream for these two too. what they are doing is ok for what it is but there's nothing \\"fusion\\" about it. it's simply a flamenco singer singing with an old tyme cuban ensemble. I should have known from the grammy nominations not to pay $75 to see this group at the conga room in l.a., but you know isaac delgado won a grammy and played the conga room so hope springs eternal.... <br /> <br />This nostalgic crap like the buena vista social club is only for jive birds! If you want to hear REALLY innovative music out of Cuba it's got to be TIMBA!!!! NG La Banda, Charanga Habanera, Bamboleo, Paulito FG, Carlos Manuel y su Clan and above all KLIMAX!!!!  Music of the 21st century awaits you in Cuba!!!

B00028HBKM|5.0|\\"The Passion Of The Christ\\" is a violent film.  I won't argue on that with anybody.  It's too violent for young children(and some adults), but I suggest watching it with older kids(thirteen and up) because there is so much more here than beatings and blood.  It's a true story about a man who died for the sins of the world.  Whether or not you believe that Christ was the Savior, you'd be sick to not have any type of feelings for Him in this film.  If you are a Christian, like myself, then you were probably moved or disturbed in a greater way than if you were an athiest.  If you are Jewish, then you might have been angered by the portrayal of your people.  Muslim, Buddhist, agnostic, etc., no matter who you are, you came out of this movie feeling different from everbody else.  None of that matters if you look at this film as being the story of a real person who is beaten and condemned to death for standing against the crowd.  The agony that Jesus endures in this film will wear you out.  This isn't a gorefest like some believe, it's real.  Mr. Gibson might have taken a few light liberties with the Gospel, but the point he gets across is that the final few hours of Jesus' human life on earth were barbaric, grotesque, emotionally and mentally draining, and full of both hatred and love toward Him.  Not only do you witness that, but you see the insanity that just might have gone on inside Judas' head after betraying Jesus.  You see the confusion and disbelief in Peter's eyes when he denies Jesus for the third time, just as Jesus said he would.  You see the agony and pain in Mary while watching her Son suffer.  The worry of possibly being held responsible for the death of the Christ is evident in Pontius Pilate's eyes as well.  Every person portrayed in this film reacts to the cruelty unfolding in front of them in a different way, just like it still happens today when we see people murdered, tortured, raped, etc. on the news and on the street.<br /><br />In all, this movie is a story about humanity.  We see the ugly side of ourselves in the Roman soldiers beating Jesus.  We see the love and warmth experienced between a mother and her son with the interaction of Jesus and Mary.  Everything plays out masterfully and with little dialogue.  That is why this film is worth five stars.  It's a great story about humans being humans.  That's why we are repulsed by the violence in it, because WE ARE CAPABLE of such violence.  That's also why we are moved by the love in this film, because WE ARE CAPABLE of that as well.<br /><br />In closing, don't view this film as a Christian, a Jew or anything else.  View it as a human-being and prepare yourself to see just how beautiful and ugly humanity can be.  Perhaps that is why this film evokes such extreme praise and hate.  It hits just a little too close to home.vie is a story about humanity.  We see the ugly side of ourselves in the Roman soldiers beating Jesus.

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game first came to my knowledge when one of my high school teachers told me about it. Being an fan of science fiction books, I took his suggestion and bought the book with high expectations for it. I was indeed correct with my expectations. This is one of the best books I ever read in my life, its an masterpiece. Ender Wiggin is one outstanding character, and he gives countless inspiration to me and probably many others. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
0812550757|4.0|Seeing as I loved Ender's Game, I bought Speaker for the Dead its sequel. Let's just say I was confused to high heavens in the first few chapters. First off, all these new characters came and I must have reread chapters one and two about five times before moving onward. Another thing was the major changes between this book and Ender's Game. <br /> <br />However I took my time and reread each chapter and finally got a firm grip on the story and continued reading. I found the beginning somewhat boring but in the middle and end were great. I found once Ender got to Lusitania the story picked up greatly. Good read and I recommend it, four starts. <br /> <br />

They are sent to live with a close \\"friend\\" of the family they have never met before named Count Olaf. He isn't exactly what you'd call \\"the family guy\\". he makes them do his houde work, which is difficutl, because his hous is more filthy than a dirt path. In time they find that Coutn Olaf isn't a great care-taker, because he is planning to steal the Baudelaire fortune that their parents left them!

B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie is one of the most clever, interesting and thoughtful films of our time. Ashton Kutcher in a serious role works excellently. Its really hard to tell the plot of this story as there is so much emotion, story and lots of thinking to be done in this movie. I was bawling my eyes out almost the whole movie. It tells of a little boy who keeps on having blackouts and doesnt realize what he is doing sometimes. He is lead to unusual actions. And Kayleigh is such a very emotional character as in he movie she is through from a happy life to unhappy, being molestered and abused to succesfulness and prostitution. Movie is about all of what I have said about Kayeigh and to further extents bad teenagehood, love, lies, animal cruelty. This movie is very kalaeidoscopic and can show how the dumbest person could have such insight in some subjects. Kutchers character is like a cat and in he movie it seems he has multiple lives, changing friends, personality due to his blackouts and psychiatric problems. He can move from one life to another by reading journals which he was told to keep. This may sound extremely confusing but it shines, and blinds on its way. Eric Bress does a wonderful job!

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Ah, what to say about Gilmore Girls. Well I could gloat that this is \\"LIKE THE BEST SHOW EVER\\", but that would be childish. I could say it's changed my world, but then I'd be obsessive. I could, however, mention the way it puts a smile on my face whenever I watch it and luckily for me, that only sounds borderline crazy. Gilmore Girls is truly a magnificent show. It is smart, sophisticated, sweet, wholesome, crazy, and wildly entertaining. If you're not up to date with the Gilmore craze, it goes a little something like this. The show follows Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Rory in their very small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow. The two are virtually insepearable and have an incredibly strong bond. Because Lorelai gave birth to Rory when she was only 16, they share a connection that leans more towards best friends than mother and daughter. They are both extremely witty, intelligent women who must survive the world one step at a time, all in the midst of their crazy town, where everyone knows each other- which makes keeping things private almost impossible. Season 2 introuduces bad-boy Jess, the nephew of Lorelai's secret love interest Luke, who takes a liking to Rory. Througout the season, Lorelai struggles between being with Max and Rory's father Christopher and the strained relationship with her parents. Meanwhile, Rory confronts her usual challenges at her private school, Chilton while facing the fear of life after high school. The season culminates in a lost love, a gained love and a few important relationships that could be changed forever. If you want something the whole family or just you can enjoy, laugh at, and love than Gilmore Girls Season 2 is perfect for you! The life of Rory and her mother are what will hook you, and their relationship with each other and their community of Stars Hollow is what will continuously pull you back. Leave it to Lorelai's introduction to show you the way to this wonderful DVD: \\"There are many paths in life. There's the 'Hey, you're cute- sure, I'll marry you after graduation and med school' and the 'Can you drive Susie to soccer today, 'cause I've got a pediure?' path. And then there's my path, where I found myself 16 and pregnant and I realized 'I have to get a job, I have to raise a kid and being me, I have to do it all by myself.' Not easy. But the thing with my path was, when I reached the end, I turned around and realized I'd ended up someplace really good.\\"
B0002IQHY8|2.0|The new release from Alan Parsons transports him into the world of electronica. One of the most plausible attributes of all the Alan Parsons albums was the seemingly perfect synthesis between the individual musical talents and Alan's unique productive skills. On this level \\"A Valid Path\\" is a major disappointment. The opening track \\"Return to Tunguska\\" introduces the embedded synthesizer drone that opened quality albums such as \\"I Robot\\" and \\"Eye in the Sky\\". What happens now is that \\"Tunguska\\" reels off into endless repetitve rambles, never venturing outside G minor, so that the music never goes anywhere. Even David Gilmour's solo fails to salvage the adriftness of this poor opener. \\"More Lost Without You\\" seems to be a call for rescue from Alan to his old faithfuls such as Ian Bairnson, Stuart Elliott, Colin Blunstone and Chris Rainbow! (Bring back Lenny Zakatek too!) This song is startlingly totally lifeless, lifelessly sung and the lyrics uninspired. Thus pre-empts the rest of the album; an array of electronic repetitions and sequences without musical substance. The only chink of light in this album is the remix of older tracks such as \\"Mammagamma\\" and \\"A Recurring Dream Within A Dream\\". I am sure that all Alan Parsons fans would relish a new album of remixes or remasters of old material along these lines. That would be an exciting prospect, and one that would entail a more lucrative, and valid path!
B00005JKQ6|5.0|The Swimmer is a excellent quality DVD. Remastered in High Definition, Anamorohic Widescreen and Dolby Digital Sound. This is a real treat for fans of Burt Lancaster who have waited for this DVD release. This is the standard by which all DVD's should be measured.
B00000JLWW|3.0|The film isn't bad. It's good escapism. James Cameron had to incorporate a lusty romance in order to have some kind of storyline, because without a story you don't have a movie. So, you can't blame him for that. <br />But if you are planning to buy this DVD, you can get it at [...] for about nine bucks, or at any Walmart for   even less. And it's the same DVD. Strange, eh?
B0002S94OS|4.0|I have to admit, after hearing who was going to produce this album ithought it was gonna suck (...) (machine...).  Turns out to be very well done.  The production quality is top notch, well above NAG and ATPB.  The guitar work and vocals are actually exceptionally better than on the others.  He does a bit of talking on it, which is kind of boring because he has the kind of computer nerd voice, but cool none-the-less.  At least he doesnt try to sing at all.  Defintely a must buy.  Best Track: Remorse is for the Dead
B00004XOWM|4.0|I'm sick of reading these reviews (i.e. the one from Brandon \\"Psycho\\" Wetzel). If you actually go to amazon.com every day, search for Limp Bizkit, and slam anyone who disagrees with you...you seriously need to get a life. I realize \\"The Chocolate Starfish\\" may not be the smartest written piece of music out there, but it's just fun to listen to! If you don't think too hard on it, you'll realize there's some great mosh pit anthems (\\"My Generation\\", \\"Rollin'\\") that'll (at least) get you pumped up and put a little smile on your face, music to listen to when you're in a bad mood (\\"Hot Dog\\") or depressed (\\"Take a Look Around\\", \\"It'll Be OK\\"). The vocals & lyrics aren't half bad on some of the songs (\\"Take a Look Around\\" & \\"Hold On\\"), and Wes Borland's guitar work is good enough it should make up for the songs with stupid lyrics. <br />And yes, I realize this wasn't really a review, and I'm going to get mobbed for putting this up here, but music is a personal preference, so leave the Bizkit fans alone, they're not \\"morons.\\" Amazon.com is not a message board, leave it for people who write actual reviews.
0767849493|1.0|Why does this movie suck this bad!this movie is dull and has no storyline.FACE THE FACTS.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|I watched this movie to the last minute, thinking it would get really good soon.  The show left me waiting until the very end when its' ending took place.  The ending was very unsatisfactory especially for those of us who like \\"happily ever after\\" endings. <br />I am sorry, but I have learned if it is nominated for an Oscar, generally I will not like it, especially in today's movies.  Thank God this was not always true! <br />
B000002H2H|1.0|This is the stupidest Pop band ive ever heard of.\\"oh yah,there the greatest band on earth\\".O......k!I diddnt know that the gratest \\"band\\" on earth would have subliminle messages like \\"SMOKE POT,SMOKE POT, EV'RYBODY SMOKE POT!!!\\"please,dont listen to this pop crap.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There is simply no doubt about it.  This is album is worth 5 stars.  It is worth 5 stars +.  YOu only have to look at the amount of people radiohead influenced with this cd and read the reviews by so many people here.  YOu wont find many more albums that people are so passionate about.  The music is beautiful.  Ok computer takes you on a journey through many emotions.  I can understand that this album is not really for those that listen to top 40 stuff - it was not made to cater for top 40 charts.  It is fantastic music.  It can be complex.  but it is so rewarding for those who keep giving it a listen.  It is not happy music.  But it is emotional and no other band can quite hit you the same way. <br />This is simply one of the albums of the 90's
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie it NOT that gory.the only gruesome scene is when they are whipping him.This by far is the best movie about Jesus Christ and his life.The details in this movie are touching.Of course,The movie can't do everything the story does.It is VERY true to the bible.Please,I am encouraging people to see it.
B000002OX7|5.0|Perosnaly if i could i'd give this baby 10 stars but i can't.  The Who's Who's Next is a great cd with greeeeeeeeeat song like Baba O'Riley, my favorite, Won't get fooled again, and Behind Blue Eyes.  If you want to get into the who hell ya get this album! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Also get Tommy, A Quick One, The Who Sings My Generation
0452285186|4.0|... and very entertaining! <br /> <br />I stumbled upon this little gem by accident and, since I am the proud owner of a bunny whom I have long suspected of being suicidal (why else would she dash between my legs as I am running across the room? or chew on electric wires? or eat paint? or stare at the balcony edge with wistful eyes?), I just had to buy it. <br /> <br />This is a very funny little book. I do wish it had been longer, as I got through it within half an hour, but I suspect I will flip through it again very soon and smile again. The mere concept is hilarious and the drawings are simple, straightforward, understated and thereby all the more effective. The main humour factor is the creativity involved in the bunnies' demise. A few are slightly obvious, but the vast majority is unnecessarily elaborate, and thereby all the more hilarious. It gets very descriptive sometimes. but never overly gory: sometimes you see the bunnies actually die, but it always seems so matter-of-fact and cynical that it's hard to get upset. For most people, the only disturbing factor will be the eternal question of why these deadpan little critters so desperately want to die. As far as I can see, being a bunny isn't so bad... <br /> <br />Obviously not something you want to show your hyper-sensitive seven-year-old, but a very entertaining, and oddly cute read. Dare we hope for a sequel?
B0002CTSW2|5.0|The movie is the best I've watched this year in theater.  Every part of the movie is perfect (musik, picture, actors, everything).  I recommend it to everyone who appreciate truth, love, pain and... piecemaster!  This is not just the story of Jesus...it's more than the facts...  I don't find the words to explain, but I can say it changed my vision of the passion of Christ.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I would rather visit the dentist than watch a horror film; for me life is scary enough without seeking further trauma. Underworld kept me watching, however, when less gory films like \\"The Unseen\\" would have had me turning the television off. First of all, I liked the premise of Vampire death squads hunting down Werewolf dens, and I understood the backstory without a problem.<br /><br />The film's look is suitably dark, decrepit, and nasty; the Lycans live in an underground bunker that looks like it was transported from the battle of Stalingrad, while the Vampires stand around a gated mansion looking like mid-70's rock stars.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale plays Selena, a death-dealer who suspects the vampire left to run her coven, Craven (bad name) is conspiring with the werewolves.  She is loyal to Viktor, the sleeping leader of her coven.  Meanwhile, Lucian, the leader of the Lycans pursues a human who holds the key to a genetic transformation that will free the werewolves from the domination of the Vampires.<br /><br />Underworld moves quickly enough that the sheer silliness of the plot doesn't impede the action, and Kate Beckinsale is eye candy enough to make compelling viewing.  The last act of the movie, however, a battle between Viktor, played by Bill Cighy (whom I last saw in \\"Love Actually) and the vampire/werewolf hybrid, leaving Kate Beckinsale to grimace for the last ten minutes of the film, is less climactic than the film needs.<br /><br />This film has interesting tones of racism that impelled me to keep watching, because the driving engine of Underworld isn't gore or blood splashing or reviving corpses, or bullets splaying, but Romeo as a werewolf and Juliet as a vampire, which is funny and sad. Yes, I hate horror films. Yes, I will watch Underworld again.
038551123X|1.0|I admit it. I fell for the hype. My mistake but not to be repeated. <br />The hype, in my opinion, comes from the premise of a \\"good guy\\" serial killer. I don't buy it. <br />Dexter has a warped sense of everything and one can only hope that characters like him do not exist in real life. On the other side, perhaps they do. In any case, I have no desire to read about them. <br />This is sick stuff and I hated the book. Understand he is writing a sequel. Won't be on my list to buy. <br />I do not recommend this stuff - maybe it should appear as a short story in the National Inquirer. Perfect fit. <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|I know the purists are annoyinging with their constant complaining that this isnt what they want but please people don't listen to their hateful banter.  This is star wars and I am excited to get this trilogy on dvd finally.  I welcome the changes to the series.  Personally if I was george Lucas I would give these stupid complainers what they want I would give them the bare bones edition dvd set that include only the movies no commentaries no behind the scenes no anamorphic just the movies and if I were him I'd charge them double the price yeah if i were lucas id charge you idiots 100$ for being so retarded.  These movies are great and they are even better with them being fixed for our time.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|\\"Ready To Die\\" is arguably one of the hottest debuts in hip-hop history. You can argue whether it is better than \\"Doggystyle\\", \\"Illmatic\\", or the select few other solo debuts to make such a list but there is no arguing its influence on the rap game. With that being known, it's not much of a surprise that P. Diddy and his Bad Boy label decided to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the album by re-releasing it in all its glory with a remastered sound, two bonus songs, and a DVD of its hit videos.<br /><br />\\"Ready To Die\\" sounds better than ever. All the hits are here still, from \\"Big Poppa\\" to \\"Juicy\\". And for those who might be wondering, the controversial \\"blow up like the World Trade\\" line that has been edited on the radio since the 9/11 attacks stays intact on \\"Juicy\\". Big's influence on the modern MC is noticeable in nearly every line he drops (and there are some hot ones). His superb duet with Method Man, \\"The What\\", which has never gotten as much love as it should, really showcases the two soon to be superstars when they were at their most powerful. Biggie touches many different subjects with \\"Ready\\" as he is able to swing back and forth from hustling (\\"Gimme The Loot\\") to steady-mackin' (\\"Me & My B*tch\\", \\"One More Chance\\") and still speak on his paranoia of death (\\"Ready To Die\\", \\"Suicidal Thoughts\\").<br /><br />\\"Ready To Die\\" was a classic album. It's been one for ten years and will continue to be one so the addition of new material really shouldn't hurt it, right? My only problem is including two new songs at the end does somewhat change the format of the album. The first bonus song, \\"Who Shot Ya?\\" was already included on Big's poorly-organized posthumous LP, \\"Born Again\\". A better choice could have been the remix to \\"One More Chance\\". The second added track, \\"Dreams\\" works because unlike the previous one it has never been comercially released. The DVD that comes included with this re-issue features four music videos of the singles from the album and some bonus camcorder footage of Biggie performing \\"Unbelievable\\" at a concert in Atlanta. If for some reason, you still don't own \\"Ready To Die\\", this is as good a reason as any to go pick it up.some bonus camcorder footage of Biggie performing \\"Unbelievable\\" at a concert in Atlanta.

B00005MP58|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this. I realise that anything I say here will be repeating what someone else has said but I don't care! <br />If you're going to watch an adaptation of an Austen book, then make sure this is the one. All too often they try to fit a classic book into a two hour movie, and to do it justice you simply have to have more time. <br />I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this, and it still never bores me (even nine years after first seeing it!). The costumes are perfect, the actors are fabulous and the houses are beautiful. It really feels like the early 1800s. <br />And, by the by, if they ever find a Darcy that's better than Colin Firth, I'll eat my....car!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Okay, I confess that I haven't actually seen this DVD yet, but I have faithfully watched the show since it aired, so I know exactly how many stars to rate it! This is my fav show, so I was so happy when I found out it was out on DVD, and I plan on getting it any day now. I highly reccomend it to anyone that wants to laugh so hard from confusion that they will cry.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Watching this film has a profound effect on me every time I watch it. The thought that only 60 years ago, people were capable of committing such abominations towards their fellow man.  <br />The genius of this film is that it allows you a glimpse of what life might have been like if, instead of the people portrayed in the movie, people like ourselves were living in german occupied territory during WWII. The lack of hope and humanity that these people had to face every day truly humbles the viewer.  <br />I find that when I'm watching this film, the question that reverberates through my mind - is simply WHY? Yes, it's a film; yes, those are actors you are watching; YES THAT REALLY HAPPENED! 6 million people were slaughtered at the whim of a mad man, they were treated as though they were lower than animals, just for their beliefs. <br />I thank Steven Spielberg for deciding to make this film, and realise that it must have been a somewhat harrowing experience to dredge up this murderous experience. It allows not just Oskar Schindler, but other's like him, to begin to get the recognition they deserve; and those who COULD have done something and didn't can hang their heads in shame. <br />This movie helps to show us that one person CAN make a difference, but who can honestly say that they could be as courageous as he was in such a terrible time?  <br />This film is the best I've seen in years. It gets you where you live because, if we entertain for a moment the thought that the Nazi's had won the war, that or something like it would probably have been in store for us, if not for men like Schindler.
B00005NTJM|2.0|If you're a Tull cultist you should get this album, but for anyone else it's just not a good effort: sloppy, rough, amateurish (Ian learned to play the flute a few months before cutting the album).  The album's title seems to indicate that the band knew this and that they wanted to move past it.  If you want some early Tull, get \\"Stand Up\\" instead.  The musicianship and arrangements are better and Tull had developed its musical concept more fully, instead of being just another Brit wannabe blues band.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is one of the best rock albums ever. Its right up there with Sgt.Pepper, Led Zep's IV and Deep Purple's Machine Head. With one exception to all those, this is by far the heaviest and sludggiest rock of them all. This was the cornerstone for grunge, the blueprint for how to rock slow, heavy and hard. But this album is definitley not limited to just that, it has punkish energy (the title track) and psychedelic trips (Planet Caravan). This was (in my opinion) the very first metal album. Sure, Iron Butterfly's In A Gadda Da Vidda was heavy but its nowhere near the power this album puts out. Anyways, this was Black Sabbath at their peak and it certainly represents Ozzy at his best despite his successful solo career, he never was a great as he was with the Sabbath. Anyways if you dont own this, its a must!
B00008DDSC|5.0|I suppose I may be impartial due to the fact that this may well be one of my favorite movies of all time, but there is so much beauty in this script, it's hard to refrain from telling everyone I know!  This is a movie that is definitely not for everyone but the first time I saw this, it left me wanting to watch it again.  Some people will watch this and say \\"Wow\\" while others will say \\"What the hell did I just watch?\\"    The movie begins with a fabulous performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal in her first starring role, as Lee, a troubled soul who finds comfort in self-mutilation, leaving a mental hospital.  After a stint for cutting too deep - \\"I don't know how I could have misjudged, I've been doing it since the seventh grade...\\" - she returns home to her dysfunctional family to try to begin life over again with the skills she has obtained from the institute.  Soon it seems, everything returns right back to the way it was - her father's out-of-control drinking, her parents fighting, her impulsively wanting to cut herself, but Peter enters and she finds some comfort in her high-school friend.    Lee enters a class in college to learn to type and soon is an efficient enough typist to decide to apply for a job she found in the paper, secretary.  James Spader, as attorney E. Edward Grey, who is also fabulous in this movie, enters as the neurotic, offbeat attorney.  From the beginning we find that Mr. Grey has his faults - ever wonder why there is a permanent \\"Secretary Wanted\\" sign outside his office?    Mr. Grey begins to get more and more \\"strict\\" it would seem with Lee, commonly using humiliation as a way to intimidate Lee.  One day Mr. Grey sits Lee down and asks her about the cutting - he has several times noticed signs of such.  He has a wonderful heart-to-heart with Lee and it is apparent that something between the two of them click as he tells her she will never cut herself again, have her mother pick her up from work and he lets her leave for the day, telling her towalk home through the park because she \\"requires relief.\\"  Lee feels something inside of her and Mr. Grey growing and she senses a form of freedom deep inside herself because her gave her \\"permission\\" to do so.  But the next day, he is back to humiliating her, which ultimately leads to spankings and a world of sadism and masochism.    The beautiful part of the film finds Lee slowly coming out of her shell and finding more confidence in who and what she is.  Mr. Grey brings something out in her that she was not aware she had.  Slowly, she finds herself attracted to Mr. Grey and his faults, while Mr. Grey finds that although Lee brings out something in him, he is too conflicted to understand himself.  He too cares for Lee, who helps him fulfill his needs, yet he feels disgusted because of what he does.    Then the day comes along in which Mr. Grey decides he cannot continue to live like this - he feels that if Lee does not go, he will not be able to stop engaging in the activity that he, as employer and Lee, as employee, partake.  The movie climaxes here and finds two souls lost until they found each other, broken apart.  What happens to them?  What happens to Peter?  I'm not going to divulge any more of this movie as I'm sure I have gone on enough, but trust me when I say that this is a must-see movie.  You may not like it, or you might, but just watch it.  I guarantee it'll be like no movie you've seen before!
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Mystic River is a haunting and tragic movie that is extremely well written, acted, and directed.  At its core it is a murder mystery, but one that is shrouded by a tragedy that befalls the three main characters as young boys.  The movie starts when Jimmy Markam, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle are small boys playing in the street.  Jimmy, the \\"hard case\\" of the bunch entices his pals to write their name in wet cement where the sidewalk is being repaired.  Two men posing as cops drive up and abduct the boy that seems to be the most weak willed - Dave.  Dave is abused but eventually escapes.  These episode forever changes the lives of all three. <br /> <br />Years later Jimmy's daughter is murdered brutally and the mystery behind her death is shrouded by a confluence of events that bring the three together again but in a rather odd fashion.  Sean is now a cop, Jimmy an ex-con, and Dave obviously behaves a bit oddly as a result of his boyhood trauma.  The mystery that emerges and the triangle between these three men is very well directed and acted.  It's a psychologically deep and dark film that lesser actors probably couldn't have pulled off.   <br /> <br />This movie may not suit everyone's tastes but I would highly recommend it. <br />
B00005JMJ4|1.0|My goodness, if ever a movie had been so boring in my childhood, I may never have watched another movie again!!  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Bill Murray and Scarlett Johnansen certainly has what it takes as a newcomer but this movie bases it success entirely on the name COPPOLA...    I can't tell you what this movie is about.  I don't know.  I don't care...  My Mother and I get together once a week and watch movies.  Old movie, new movies, color movies, black-and-white movies, silent movies, and we could not wait for the release of this.  So finally, it came out and we watched it...  and watched it...  and watched it...  and waited for something to happen.  It never did.    This is not even one of those movies you can say, \\"Hmmm.  Didn't like it the first time, maybe I'll watch it again and I'll like it.\\"  Absolutely not.  That opportunity will never come.  I will not watch this again.  Sorry, Sofia, but you should give those awards back for this one.
B00008WG3U|5.0|I am a fan of NOFX ever since I started to listen to them over three years ago. By releasing this CD, I noticed that NOFX was going to release a political punk CD like Pennywise, Anti-Flag and others. This is a great CD. Opening with the hard hitting \\"Separation of church and skate\\" and featuring two awesome tracks in \\"Franco Un-American\\" and \\"The Idiots are Taking Over\\", this CD is one of NOFX's finest works in terms of lyrics and music.
B000268QB2|1.0|I love the floating melodies so much...but in a way, hearing it on every song gets old quick.  Also - the melodies on most of the tracks I was disapointed with.  The best track is Somewhere Only We Know - because even though you know where it's going with the melody, the build to the choris totaly builds up drama - and it's beautiful.   <br />I don't see the comparision to Coldplay and Travis.  Frankly, I think those bands are way better lyricaly and in the araingment of their tracks.  Whereas, I prefer the vocalist of Keane because of the passion that's clear in the first track.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is a DVD that should be in everyone's collection. People like Mr. Bush, and his administration, are what makes America a target. Yankees go home, can-sprayed on walls all around the world, gave place to attacks on American citizens, property, and more... There is a tendency for people to generalize, and generalizations are never good. America is, like any other country, made by individuals, and a country divided by opinions... The Terminators, Rambos, and Bushes, are certainly NOT America, nor are they representative of American people. We all know about all that is behind politics, and the fact that no clean, truly independent guy and gal ever gets to the White House. That is why there is such mistrust in leadership, and such lack of confidence in politicians being more then just self-serving people, put in place by those who pull the srings behind the scenes... Moore just shouts out, and does so for many Americans!, that not all Americans are dorks! He does so, by showing he takes no liking to Mr. Bush, and does so well. Dustin Hoffman and Robert de Niro a few years ago (Wag the Dog) helped tell the same story... Many others have told the same story... Only this time, Bush, is the clown! This is not a hate Bush and vote for Kerry documentary. They are all the same. This is a voice that raises from the dust, in a country usually seen as democratic, but indeed run by fascists and imperialists, whose leaders often should be answering for war crimes sitting at the Hague Court, and is saying, \\"I am American, but I stand for a true America!, not for what sadly America has turned into along the years.\\" <br /> <br />Bravo, Mr. Moore, with you, I can also be proud of being an American! With the likes of Bush and his dogs, we are covered in shame!  <br /> <br />History will judge you, Mr. Bush, and let's not forget how you have covered America in shame, so History does not have to repeat itself!!!
B00005JMAH|5.0|This movie is so much better then the first two! This one actually has the magic. I love it. I thought it was brilliant! As soon as I found out that Alfonso Cuaron was going to direct it, I knew it was going to be really great. He also directed \\"A Little Princess\\" another magical film.
B00026YO36|5.0|Lanegan is a man of many \\"phases.\\" As a matter of fact, you may be reading this review either because of his work with Screaming Tress, his haunting and stripped down Americana solo output, or his recent singing contributions to Queens Of The Stone Age, have interested you enough to see what our boy is up to here.<br /><br />The good news here is that Lanegan, rather than \\"returning\\" or \\"departing\\" from what you may be used to, has brought all of it together into a an intense boil, and come out of it with a powerful collection of songs that will offer immediate, if different, favorites for everyone.<br /><br />In addition to this, the list of musicians called on to help his efforts is quite impressive and likely to make you salivate, even before the album starts playing. Whether it is PJ Harvey, Afghan Whigs/Twilight Singers' mastermind Greg Dulli, or Josh Homme -from QOFTA- to name only the ones I was most excited about and intrigued by for what they may add to this album, their contributions are a major plus to \\"Bubblegum'\\"s sound.<br /><br />Speaking of \\"bubblegum\\" -a reference from a line in the song \\"Bombed\\"-Lanegan could not sound farther from what that word may make you expect. Actually, he sounds closer to Tom Waits than ever before, a similar tone yet not ever trying to imitate Tom, and he phrases his words in ways that remind me -at least me- of the dark sensuality of Jim Morrison.<br /><br />The reference to Morrison may be more apparent on \\"When Your Number Isn't Up,\\" and ominous and prophetic slow tune about mortality, or \\"Wedding Dress,\\" as dark a \\"love song\\" as you can expect.<br /><br />As far as Lanegan ability to bring into a single album everything he's explored musically in the past, I'd like to name some of the remaining tunes. \\"Methamphetamine Blues\\" is probably densest piece of the bunch, in part thanks to Homme's raging guitar and the machine-like pipe-banging that drives the song from the beginning ... Let's just say its title could not be more accurate<br /><br />PJ Harvey's duet on the quieter \\"Come To Me\\" -one of two songs she sings on- makes it another high moment from this album, giving it a sensuous and menacing mood, think of it as a hymn to dark love.<br /><br />Other songs I particularly recommend are \\"Morning Glory Wine,\\" as tender a ballad as Lanegan gets; the bluesy \\"Like Little Willie John;\\" and the dense beauty of \\"Strange Religion\\" and \\"One Hundred Ways.\\"<br /><br />Last but not least, I must mention Chris Goss' co-production, which gives Lanegan a partner who seems to read his mind and soul, and pushes him to further greatness, and Wendy Rae Fowler whom I didn't know but whose voice adds incredible depth to the above-mentioned \\"Wedding Dress, and the very brief, although sad and gorgeous, \\"Bombed.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this is a remarkable album, a dark and fierce set of songs that has stretched Mark Lanegan in more directions than any of his prior recordings, and, to my taste, one of the best albums of 2004.vey's duet on the quieter \\"Come To Me\\" -one of two songs she sings on- makes it another high moment from this album, giving it a sensuous and menacing mood, think of it as a hymn to dark love. <br />Other songs I particularly recommend are \\"Morning Glory Wine,\\" as tender a ballad as Lanegan gets; the bluesy \\"Like Little Willie John;\\" and the dense beauty of \\"Strange Religion\\" and \\"One Hundred Ways.\\" <br />Last but not least, I must mention Chris Goss' co-production, which gives Lanegan a partner who seems to read his mind and soul, and pushes him to further greatness, and Wendy Rae Fowler whom I didn't know but whose voice adds incredible depth to the above-mentioned \\"Wedding Dress, and the very brief, although sad and gorgeous, \\"Bombed.\\" <br />All in all, this is a remarkable album, a dark and fierce set of songs that has stretched Mark Lanegan in more directions than any of his prior recordings, and, to my taste, one of the best albums of 2004.
B000002UB3|5.0|This is one of those rare pieces of pop that crosses into an important realm only turly great music does: if it could be described in words it would have been literature. Would you explain Hamlet with a song? <br /> <br />BTW, it remains, 35 years later, the best produced album ever.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Michael Moore does it again. Presents a \\"Documentary\\" filled with lies and Anti Americanism. <br />He should be ashamed but I am sure he is not. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000005GYI|4.0|I've not had music engage my mind like this in ages. It's wonderful, it sucks; it's derivative, it breaks new ground; it's boring, it's fascinating. Those are just the first three contrasts that pop into my head and that's just a couple songs in. And let me say those negatives are only momentary lapses brought on by the fact that this music is so good that you're completely disapointed when it lapses into  just pretty good. Yes, that's mid 60's Beatles and '70 McCartney you hear in there. And, yes, I think George Benson was listening and figured out 5 years later what the heck Nascimento was up to. Yet it's without question of its time, it sounds absolutely early 70's. Except for that little part that...well you get the picture. Or maybe not, because I still don't. It's its own thing, without a doubt. And it can't be described in words, which is why Nascimento chose music. Think I'll go listen again.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Political activist Michael Moore has certainly honed his craft as a documentary filmmaker and concurrently raised a firestorm of extreme feelings about the Bush administration. Since receiving boos at last year's Academy Awards ceremony for calling Bush a \\"fictitious President\\" who was leading us to a \\"fictitious war\\", he has fast become a touchstone not only for the agitated left but for all those who have felt increasingly alienated by the imperial hubris of the current administration. Whether you like this film or vehemently hate it will depend far less on the quality of the filmmaking (which by the way, is excellent) as it does on how you plan to vote in November's election. Ignore this film at your own risk, as it is a powerful indictment creatively executed. Better to view it and discuss its implications, as it won't go away thanks to Moore's constant and savvy media campaign. He was fully aware of the coming firestorm and given his history, I'm sure he welcomes it as his agenda leaves no room for historical context or an analysis of facts or debate. It's a brilliant blame game and frankly quite a convincing one at that. As a filmmaker, Moore has become far less didactic than he was with \\"Roger and Me\\" or even \\"Bowling for Columbine\\". Instead, he has become an almost subtle alarmist and a first-rate filmmaker.<br /><br />Mercifully, Moore is far less visible in this documentary as his first-person rantings and attempts at ridicule can get tiresome even if the treatment was deserved. The one exception is his admittedly humorous attempt at the end of the film to get U.S. Congressmen to enlist their children for Iraq on their way to work. Otherwise, his presence is felt in the calm yet pointed narration. The film starts with a compelling argument for the illegitimacy of Bush's election. This was actually the most revealing sequence, as we go beyond the chad controversy into all the odd connections and situations that appeared jerry-rigged to ensure Bush's victory. I dare anyone to watch this part and justify not voting in the next election. Moore then goes into the murky, under-the-table relationship between the Bush and the bin Laden clans before he became President, especially the suspicious way the FBI decided to fly the entire American side of the bin Laden family out of the U.S. two days after 9/11 without holding any of them for questioning. Whether his conjecture about the triangulation among the Saudis, the Bushes and oil is true or not, it has credibility in the way it is presented. This sequence catapults us into the grim reality of war, showing dying Americans and Iraqis, and speaking with a few of the thousands of casualties at U.S. hospitals who feel betrayed. There is a shocking sequence that follows a Christmas eve interrogation of a seemingly unsuspicious Iraqi family, as well as another one with U.S. troops ridiculing hooded detainees near Samara (sadly paralleling the humiliations that occurred at Abu Ghraib).  Finally, Moore does bring the conflict home with a sadness quite familiar to anyone with recollections of Vietnam, when the heretofore devoted military supporter Lila Lipscomb reads a letter from her son who was killed in Iraq, noting: \\"He got us here for nothing whatsoever.\\" It is probably the most predictable moment in the film but also its most personal.<br /><br />What resonates most in the film are images most of us never got to see on the news, like the series of African-American congressional members being turned away for their pleas of invalidating the Florida election results; or Marine recruiters manipulating small-town, low-income teens in Flint; or most infamous, the time-lapsed seven minutes as a slightly perturbed Bush reads \\"The Pet Goat\\" in front of a Florida kindergarten class. Praise or vilify Michael Moore, but it is difficult to deny that much of what he does claim is at minimum strangely coincidental and at worst immoral. A perfect example in the film is the passing of the U.S.Patriot Act, where at least some of the material in the USA Patriot Act had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved long-sought items on the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass Congress, but which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration assurances that they were essential to fighting terrorism. It is hard to stomach that kind of logic.<br /><br />Moore has grown significantly since \\"Roger and Me\\" in 1989 and not just around the waistline. Believe it or not, this is not the most damning film that he has done, just the most publicized and certainly the best timed in light of the upcoming Presidential election. Moore places less emphasis on espousing his opinions this time around and more on facts, figures, quotes and actual footage from real events that actually make the viewers decide for themselves. The film is not perfect, not nearly, but it is important viewing. My recommendation is to see this film, then read John O'Neill's grudge-laden \\"Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry\\" and see which one you find least objectionable to lead the country.re at least some of the material in the USA Patriot Act had nothing to do with 9/11, and instead involved long-sought items on the FBI agenda which had previously been unable to pass Congress, but which were enacted by Congress under Bush administration assurances that they were essential to fighting terrorism.

B00005ASHM|4.0|I'm not particularly a fan of the Beach Boys' dreamy, falsetto, laid back Southern Cal sound, but something else, more compelling and profound than surface style comes through in Pet Sounds. The melodies define natural musical talent; Wilson's a baby Bach. His music comes out in structures that echo the ascensions and declensions of classical compositions. Yet, it's also intensely personal. Next to Wilsons' achingly earnest lyrics with perfectly matched music, the Beatles come off as almost unbearably cute and ingratiating.
0790729628|5.0|I watched The Director's Cut again (haven't watched it in a couple of years), and it is still a stunning movie for something made 24 years ago. Something I complain about with the first two Star Wars movies is not just the the dialouge feeling a bit forced, but the visuals, as cool as they look, lack the \\"grit\\" that was more evident in the original trilogy, and especially in this movie. Designing the bowels of Coruscant, they should've taken a cue from what a city should REALLY look like by watching this one.<br /><br />Anyways, back to Blade Runner, the removal of Harrison Ford's narration was much better to me. I felt when I saw the original back in the day, his narration seemed like it was more in-the-way than being helpful. Also, the removal of the \\"happy ending\\" made it much more open-ended, and more wide open to speculation. As for the possibility that Deckard was a replicant, Phillip K. Dick's book seems to stir up that speculation, without ever really answering it...even now, it's still subject for debate. That the influence of the book/movie to cyberpunk books/movies is apparent: individual vs. the system, whether it's Deckard working outside the system (ex-cop), or the Repllicants that are renegades outside of the system. The movie also has that detective/film noir feel, set in a futuristic, but bleak, setting.<br /><br />I recently read that because of legal issues, the movie hasn't been given the \\"Special Edition\\" treatment, which is a shame. I'd like to see both the original theatrical release, and see the D.C. version, and see how much different the two movies are. The film quality is in need of cleaning up (graininess here and there), and an improvement of the sound quality to digital couldn't hurt. But, even now though, this movie was certainly ahead of it's genre, and still looks decent today.
B0002TSZK6|5.0|I was impressed.  I mean, I've never been a big Michael Moore fan -- I'm still ticked off at him for backing Ralph Nader in the 2000 elections, and I think his reasoning is often overly simplistic and fuzzy-minded.  But I think this movie did an excellent job of making his leftie-pragmatic viewpoint accessible to mainstream America, and the information is presented in a very thoughtful, persuasive manner.  There are many, many things in this movie that I have simply not seen in the media before, or even heard about -- notably the squelching of Congressional dissent in the 2000 elections, a travesty presided over by Senate leader Al Gore, and some of the gut-wrenching footage from Iraq, which, amazingly, was fairly restrained, considering how much more, and much more gruesome footage must be available.  Anyway, I guess now I'm more grateful that Michael Moore is out there.  The current climate of trying to cut off all discussion and debate on issues of national disagreement, the my-way-or-the-highway attitude of the GOP media machine, is profoundly un-American, and if left unchecked may threaten the foundations of our very society.  (Debate and honest differnces of opinion makes us stronger and wiser, fellas!!)  So, I respect Moore for his persistent role in keeping civic discussion free and open, even if I don't always agree with him.  If you think you disagree with Moore, but haven't seen the movie, see the movie, and then decide how much you still disagree with him.
630526323X|3.0|Although there are some great atmospheric shots in Nosferatu, as well as major creepiness any time the vampire himself comes onto the screen, there are long periods when the film just seems to stutter and die. This is not simply due to the generally slow pace of the film, although that does play a part sometimes. Rather, there are just too many minor annoyances that pile up. There is far too much &quot;moralizing&quot;, especially towards the end of the film.  The trouble is that these moralizing speeches come across sounding like the characters who are speaking them are utterly uninterested in what they are saying; ex. when Mary says to Dracula &quot;salvation must come from within ourselves&quot;, she says it so matter-of-factly that any effect that the statement might have had on the viewer completely dissappears. And on and on.<br />Perhaps these scenes sound better in the German version; I don't know.<br />Also, for such a serious movie it's quite hard to take some of the actors in it seriously; the madman who joins Dracula when he comes to London has a laugh that is so ridiculous by the end of the film that it's just not possible to not crack up laughing at his acting (probably not what Herzog had intended).  I was also quite dissappointed with Van Helsing's character in this movie, who during half of his time on the set rambles on about how Science (with a capital S) has DISPROVED everything supernatural (which, apart from being completely at odds with his character in the original book, is also a very stupid statement).<BR>Scenes that were important in the original movie (such as the ship's journey to England) are given short shrift here.<BR>Also, Herzog doesn't seem to mind introducing continuity problems for the sake of atmosphere.  For example, when Jonathan is in Dracula's castle there is a young Gypsy boy who stands in the daytime near the castle, alone, and plays (really badly) a strange melody on a fiddle. Why anyone would want to stand beneath Dracula's castle and play on a fiddle is not answered.<br />There ARE some redeeming factors to the film.  For example, the introduction to this film is marvellously creepy and unnerving, showing us statues of dead and decomposing bodies. I also really liked how Herzog handled the plague that came to London (although why one vampire would want to kill hundreds of people each night is beyond me...); there is one extended scene in particular where the camera takes a stroll through the sickened city, where those who pay attention to detail will be able to find all sort of gruesome and disturbing events that happen, perfectly choreographed.<br />Overall, though, this does not seem to me to be the classic that many here are making it out to be.  I've heard that the German version is superior, so perhaps I've judged the film too early.
0393035158|5.0|This is an amazing book.  If you are a person of faith, The End of Faith will be a very real challenge to you (and it is a challenge you should not shirk).  If you are a person of reason, this book will articulate what you have already thought, better than you thought it.  It is high time that our public discussion about religion proceeded along the lines Harris sketches in his book.  I can only hope that some people in positions of influence will read it.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|The seminal classic needs no introduction, but among the beautiful lessons I've learnt in the seven times I've watched it with rapt attention:<br /><br />(1) A character incapable of emotional development ironically teaches a \\"sane\\" man to connect.<br />(2) The power of surprising ourselves by changing just that little bit.<br />(3) Appreciation for autism and how little gestures of understanding can go far.<br />(4) Hans Zimmer is as safe a bet for film scores as Hoffman is for character roles.<br />(5) Tom Cruise has possibilities too, when inevitable.<br /><br />A splendid tale of spiritual transformation and acceptance, of getting in touch with things that transcend materialistic trappings. DVD features include audio commentaries by Levinson, Bass and Morrow, a deleted scene, and a making-of feature.<br /><br />An invaluable possession for every serious collection.
B000021XS0|5.0|One of the best albums I have ever heard. An amazing concept, backed by amazing music. If you don't know how a guitar is played, and have never heard of Steve Howe or Steve Vai, and all ya peeps at da mall can't stop talking about posa-gangsta-rappa Limp Bizkit, you won't like this. John Petrucci is one of the best in his field, and Mike Portnoy blows my mind. They are, I think better live than they are in the studio, and if don't have the sense to know how good a guitar player is, you won't appreciate this album. Since it is not fluff-pop, or rap, or punk, no-one will ever play it on the radio.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I think Quintin was very creative in putting it all togather, beleive me it couldn't have gotten any better. Some may think Quintin is over doing it, i think everything is possible. Uma really shocked everyone with her stellar performance, her facial expression really showed desire and ambition for revenge. I really loved the epilogue in the begining of the second movie, the acting was awsome and loved the cameo appearance of Sameul L. Jackson. Every sowrd lover, martial artist out there will love this movie. The story is excellent with excellent revealing of plot and battle scenes.
B00008DDSC|1.0|What a waste of money I did by buying this DVD. It's a story about two sickos who deserve each other. I like movies about a story that could happen in real life, I can't imagine why they let her loose from the Institution and why he wasn't in the Nuthouse where he belonged.
0380789035|5.0|What an imagination Neil Gaiman has. I LOVED the entire concept of this novel. Very original story line with a wonderful selection of characters. Also Neil Gaiman has made the main character Shadow such a simple, lovable guy that he just pulls at your hearstrings. Shadow is finally getting out of jail. All he wants is to return to his simple life with the woman he loves Laura. Before he leaves prison, he finds out that Laura has been killed. He has no other family and Laura was pretty much his life. His heart is broken and he is at a loss. On the flight home to Laura's funeral Shadow meets a very interesting man named Wednesday. Shadow tries to avoid him, but Wednesday ultimately hires Shadow and takes him on a very wild journey through middle America, with some of the most interesting characters I have ever come across. This is a wonderful story. I would highly recommend
B00003CXCT|4.0|This set would get five stars from me once upon a time.  However while I will probably buy it I can't help but be disappointed by the supposed changes to these classics that make them less classic. Mr. Lucas is trying too hard to make these movies fit in with the very inferior prequels when it should be the other way around.  People who welcome these changes are part of the generation of fans who prefer movies that use a \\"story\\" to show off special effects rather than use effects to help tell the story. Yes, I know the meat of the story in this trilogy is very much in one piece.  However, who would want to see Gone With the Wind or The Wizard of Oz be \\"updated\\"? So why should these movies be touched? These still are great movies.  I just really wish I could see them on DVD the way I first saw them about twenty years ago.
B0000508U6|5.0|I have been working like a dog in my first year of medical residency.  My exposure to new music has been limited, so I went back to an album tonight that I had listened to excessively at one point and shelved.  I listened to Parachutes from beginning to end and it was, simply, bliss. <br /> <br />Without pretense, this is one of the prettiest albums I have ever owned.  I may have spotted them a star as I am totally hosed right now (try spending a hundred hours a week with sick people, see if you don't drink), but I just made it through Sparks, Yellow, and Trouble for the second time tonight.  There is not much more to ask for in terms of achingly simple and pretty melodies and voices.
B0002IU988|3.0|If you are expecting another Creed style CD this isn't it, however it's still worthy of purchasing. Good rock, but Creed/Alter Bridge might want to consider shopping for another new singer and eventually they will find their match.
B0000399WC|5.0|Papillion is one of the best prisoner stories ever, and this film completly captures the book. Dustin Hoffman does a great job as dega and Steve Mcqueen is the exact papillion one imagines reading about in the book. The tale is extremely gripping all the way to the great ending. It's a story that always leaves me satisfied. I highly recommend this to anyone that likes Prison stories or Adventure stories.
0385484518|5.0|a very touchy book. i rate it 5 out of 5 coz either a college student like me or any person can relate in the story. it teaches every reader the other side of life....the real life the life that i ignored by everybody everyday...the material, noisy an rebelious world...mitch is a very lucky person to have a proffessor and a very great friend like morrie...there are only few person existed here on earth like him!
6301966562|5.0|This movie is a classic from the '80's.  If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it!!  Cute, funny, romantic and all centered around a computer!  Edgar is his name and antics are his game. The soundtrack to this movie is also great and I have that too! <br /> <br />I fell in love with this movie and have purchased a use video store copy but I would certainly LOVE to see this on DVD!!  Come on let's make some noise for this movie on DVD!
0062502182|2.0|I agree with other reviews which found this book 'simple'.  Although the book itself makes a point of showing that keeping things simple is good practice.<br /><br />The book is apparently an international best-seller that came out in '88 and has been read by people over and over again and ... changed their lives.  I read THE ALCHEMIST as recommended by a friend.  While reading, I was building up to that feeling of change at several places in the book, but it passed quickly.<br /><br />The book is simply full of short, sharp lessons on achieving your dreams, learning from everything you experience, stopping and taking the time to actually study every bit of the world around you.<br /><br />Personally - I think the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (yes, all seven books) by C.S. Lewis achieves the same journey in a much better fashion.
1563890119|5.0|all in all the entire series is a masterpiece of masterpieces. there was so many great parts of each of the books. the first one just barely touched on the overwhelming collection. it also gives you a somewhat different feel to morpheus. the stories. the \\"24 hours\\" portion of the story was one of the most unusual and creative ways to show what a psycho would do with powers not of this world. the introduction of alot of people's favorite character death was a pleasant ending. the mythology gradually gets better as the series progresses, but it is great how they introduce the dream king as a prisoner due to rules made in the world of reality. this was the first serious graphic novel i read and i wish that the series would never end, but as it stands i am reading the books again because there is so much to put together.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|There is really not much to write about this. I cannot believe that AP project could get into these waters and sink so low. A horrible CD, better forgotten as soon as possible. I still don't understand the rational behind this release. Why do people like AP need to reinvent themselves...A totally catastrophic release that will leave a dark shadow on an impecable career.

This movie lives up to it's billing as the best mob movie ever made, and will be around for years to come wowing viewers with it's raw intensity.
0393035158|5.0|In this exquisitely written and researched book Harris addresses topics of faith and religion that most are too timid to face.  He does not shy away from making bold claims about the place of faith in a modern, global society.  His arguments are stimulating and thought-provoking, and should bring any reader to both consider and question how far we are willing to go to protect the unreasonable, unprovable/undisprovable beliefs of others that infringe upon our own rights.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|this album was released in 1999 <br />it is now 2006 <br />about 7 years after the release and i am still in awe at how magnificent this album is.  <br />i think everyone who gives this album a listen will realize and imagine just how much time and effort was put into the making of these songs. <br /> her voice sounds so weary and vulnerable the lyrics are so strong, emotional, and powerful. <br />this is like one of the best cds of the decade =[.
0780624890|5.0|Hearing about the third installment in the Blade series prompted me to see the first two movies in the franchise. I watched Blade II first, and absolutely loved it. Then I watched this film. I have to say before anything else that I did like Blade II better than the first, but the original one still has its positives. <br /> <br />When this movie first came out in 1998, it was given so-so feedback from critics, but was very popular at the box office. It was the first ultimately successful vampire movie yet. The sequel was anticipated from when it was first announced. <br /> <br />The one thing I find weird about this movie is that it is marketed as both an action movie, and a horror movie. At most stores in the DVD section, you'll find Blade in the horror aisle. This film really isn't a scary movie. It's an intense action movie. And oh yes, the action. It's amazing. Fight coreography is top-notch, and the gunfire sequences please one's eyes as well. <br /> <br />Wesley Snipes is excellent as Blade, and he continued well with the character in Blade II. Kris Kristofferson also stars as Whistler, and he too returns in the second film. Stephen Dorff plays Deacon Frost. He plays a great villain. Who ever made the decision to cast him, it was a good one. He makes you enjoy the movie even more. <br /> <br />Overall, Blade is a very entertaining action film that one can watch many times over again. <br /> <br />Sidenote: The DVD contains excellent audio and video quality, and a rather large handful of supplements. Included are audio commentaries from the cast and crew, an isolated score of the film, 4 featurettes, pencil sketches of production designs, house of erebus, cast and crew biographies and filmographies, and the original theatrical trailer.
B000002WU9|5.0|Another classic album by the legendary Wu-tang clan.  Rza once again, absolutely killed the boards on production on this one.  Some of the beats just put you in a trance and then your necks broke from bobbin'. Rae and Ghost's styles blend perfectly with one another to make yet another cd I can put in and not touch a button except the volume.  I'd advise anybody reading to also check out Liquid Swords, Return of the 36, and obviously Enter the 36.  Cuban Linx is a beautiful album though, every song is a gem.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|'I would be proud to lead you wonderful guys into battle....anytime....anywhere'.  And with that line....Patton is personified.  The commandant of the rampaging 3rd army is a fascinating character study....a general who was fascinated by battles past and had no political ambition after the war.  He simply wanted to lead an army to glorious victory...which he did brilliantly.  George C Scott portrays the gregarious Patton and plays it to perfection.  The voice, uniform, swagger,  its all there.  He truly becomes Patton and won a well deserved Academy Award for best Actor.<br /><br />  Not to be missed,  its truly one of the greats.
B000002WPI|5.0|This is the cd that changed the way I listened to hip-hop.  I was a huge fan of B. and Rakim, Run, Slick, Ultra, but this was truly a different sound, none that had ever been heard before.  I won't be able to say anything different than what has already been said in these other 200 reviews.  Every song is a classic, one of the few cd's that I can still throw in and not touch a button other than volume.  Rza's production over some of the rawest lyrics a group could spit, the most cohesive 9 man group to date, it just places this cd in a class of its own.  So many personalities all mended together perfectly, I'm still listening to it 11 years later.
0553277472|5.0|Ignore the knobs below who gave it 1 star (it's probably the same guy anyway). Read it. It's not easy reading, but worth the effort. If you don't like to think too much or be challenged too much, skip it. Also, yes, much or most or all of it can be found in classic philosophical writings, but it's a fresh take and a very personal and powerful one.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is one of Pac's best.  Pac was and is the greates rapper ever.  The beats are tight but the lyrics are what shine.  Pac lyrics are sweet and his flow is unreal.  ED Daniels to say that pac was just out for money is just ludacris.  You have not listened to his lyrics and the passion he sings them with.  pac was such a deep person and because of a few contraversial songs idiots like E D Daniels think pac was the devil.  Please give pac a chance and listen to the lyrics not what other people say.
B00003CXCT|3.0|okay the dude who says for the \\"old generation\\" to stop whining about the changes to the classic trilogy has some flawed logic. first of all everyone has a right to complain...that's what being American is all about and secondly we are the people who made the trilogy the huge success it is because we loved that trilogy. now Lucas has every right to go and make the changes he wants to make for a directors cut or expanded edition of whatever he wants, but i think it is complete bullsh*t that he will not release the orginal trilogy for people to buy. it proves that he has very little interest in what the fans want and is more interested in what he can do with all those neat computers out at the Skywalker Ranch. but then again you probably thought the Matrix movies were pretty sweet too so i guess you can't account some people's taste.
0767802470|5.0|I rarely buy movies. I rarely sit through long movies. I never re-watch movies. <br /> <br />\\"Das Boot\\" was totally different, I happened by it on late night TV (the full director's cut). <br />I was not bored for one minute. It was 209 minutes long and it felt shorter than some crappy 30minute shows I've seen. <br />It was such a great movie, I actually bought the DVD (for the record, I only own 4 DVD's, this is one of them). <br /> <br />Some people say it's a war movie or submarine movie. I think it's really a movie about people. It just happens to take place at war, in a submarine. <br /> <br />Yes, amazing, nearly the whole movie takes place within the cramped confines of a U-Boat and I was not bored... <br /> <br />Really a great film!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Folks, don't let these previous reviewers throw you off with the term 'goofy' comedy...for this (no exaggeration) is one of the most geniously written comedies of our modern generation...In my opinion this is the second funniest movie ever (And i've seen a good share from Arsenic & Old Lace to Dr. Strangelove to Titanic). At first watch, this film will no doubt seem sort've stupid....but get past that, watch the film a second, third, and fourth time....Every line in this film is comedy, literally. If the movie is watched with an open-mind and listend to every second, your hour-and-a-half will be one of the most entertaining you've ever had. From using Wham!'s \\"Wake me up before you go go\\" to Hansel asking to call Matilda, 'Matil' many bits of comedy go missed.    \\"Hansel, he's so hot right now\\"
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Let's just say that when pop stars actually put effort into writing their lyrics and expressing themselves, the end product is amazing.  When I bought this album I was expecting something a little different.  I was expecting songs with heavy guitar like unwanted and losing grip from her former album.  Instead I got a lot more; songs that were just as angry, but displayed a lot more depth. When I first heard don't tell me, I really wasn't that impressed, it was an okay song, but it definetly wasn't first single material.  I was actually expecting her to release something very poppy as to not alienate her former fans.  It wasn't until I heard \\"Happy Ending\\" that i decided to give the cd a listen.  It was actually very good, the lyrics one some of the songs are a little weak and cliched, but they seem to contain more weight when sang in more serious songs.  I would defintely reccomend buying this album, but I do warn that this album is very different then Let go.
0425188809|4.0|First let me start by saying this is a book you should read if your are into horror or SiFi.  It has one hell of a good villian.  The villain is the best part.   <br /> <br />The next best part of the book, an I know many will thrash me for saying it, is the Sheriff and NSA agent.  They really play a major role in my opinion.  The retriever, alex and his girlfriend are good but take second place to the above Mentioned. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't like about this book was it was a bit to preachy.  Not so much that it ruined it, I just could have used a little less.
0790729377|5.0|Ok, the acting doesn't get any better...undisputed fact. I find the BIOPOLAR Stanley hilarious, along with everything else people have said for over half a century.  Brando even said in his autobio that Jessica Tandy would get mad at him during the play because audiences would laugh at him as he tormented her, diminishing her character, and she blamed him. Guess she had to blame somebody.   <br /> <br />But Marlon Brando, in all his genius, depth, brilliance, talent, etc, etc, etc, just plain cracks me up, in his movies and to confirm his sense of humor, in his autobio.  I was laughing so hard I couldn't even read the part in his autobio when he was talking about his visit on the set of \\"The Godfather\\" from a cocked eyed mob boss.  <br /> <br />He said, \\"The first thing I noticed about him was that one of his eyes looked to the left and the other to the right.  I didn't know which one to look at, so, trying not to offend him, I alternated between them.\\"  This simply cracked me completely up.  But when he quoted the mob boss during a tour of the set as saying, \\"I don't know how you keep from goin' nuts Marlo, with all these people and all these wires and everything,\\" Brando wrote, \\"I agree, the whole thing is really cockeyed, isn't it?\\"  Then I looked into his cocked eyes and realized what I'd said.  I spun around, trying to divert his attention to something on the set and to get a glimpse of his reaction peripherally.  For a moment he blinked and I thought I saw a hurt look flash across his face, but the moment passed, and I babbled a mouthful of mush to fill the air with words, not knowing what in the world I was saying.\\"  I am still trying to imagine a big bad cocked eyed gangster with a hurt look on his face due to \\"Marlo's\\" slip of the tongue.    <br /> <br />This was the funniest part of his autobio to me, although the man cracked me up through the entire reading as he does in his movies, serious or not, he makes me smile.  He just has an amazing effect on me and I think it's deeper than just his unparalleled acting ability because I'm not all that impressed with actors.  I'm gonna keep searching until I find out what it really and truly is about him that, as he says in his autobio about him almost getting strangled to death at the premier of Guys and Dolls, \\"turns crowds into mobs\\".   <br /> <br />I know his courage has a lot to do with it and my attraction to strength and courage is an obvious connection, but I still think there is more and I'm gonna keep digging.  His movies are revealing (he spilled his guts in Last Tango In Paris while playing the harmonica), as well as in his autobio, but there was more to this man than we will probably ever know, more than he probably ran out of time to find out. Head's up for us to forever examine our own lives because there is obviously more to us than meets the eye, as Eva Marie Saint said when Brando asked her in On The Waterfront, 'what more do you want?'...much more, much, much more!
0451169514|5.0|The title says it all.  There is not a Horror novel out there that is better.  If there is one I have not read it.  IT is so large, so well written and has so many great characters that it boogles the mind. And lets not forget the clown! I mean WOW! He is one serious villain.   <br /> <br />If you are a horror fan and you have not read this book, you truly owe it to youself to read it.  You will not be sorry that you sent the time, you'll actually be sorry that its over.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I preordered this as soon as it became available.  Really liked the moive, but I think I will like this more.  I wanted more Matt Murdock and more story and the DC promises to deliver both.  And More JENNIFER GARNER!  PANT!  PANT!
B000054OTY|4.0|This is a great western, and Brando and Maldon give outstanding performances. Brando's girl (Pina Pellicer) is a stunning beauty and perfect for this film. The scenes with Brando and Slim Pickens are priceless, and Brando's line to the \\"tub of guts\\" woman abuser is (in my view) one of the best lines in movie history. All the supporting cast is superb too. This is what makes for a great film. <br /> <br />This really deserves a \\"5\\" rating - but then video quality has to be considered. This review is for the Platinum version, which is good, but not great. Having seen this movie on TV, it has beautiful coastal scenery and overall excellent photography. Based on all the reviews I've read, currently  NONE OF DVDs out there are top quality.  That's a shame.  <br /> <br />I suggest just waiting until this movie is reissued in high quality widescreen format.  Let's hope that's not too long!
B0000648WZ|1.0|\\"Showgirls\\" really isn't Paul Verhoeven's worst film -- this one is!  Heinlein's novel is a thoughtful neoconservative critique of democratic capitalist society circa 1958 which still is widely read and discussed today. It's just cleverly camoflaged as the best military SF novel ever. Verhoeven tried to turn the story around into a squishy liberal pacifist critique of democratic capitalist society circa 1996, camoflaged as a gory action/porn flick that studio execs would fund lavishly. It utterly fails at this goal through sheer stupidity and heavy-handedness. The facistic society and military of future Earth are so simplisticly presented that the intelligent viewer is unsure whether it is intended as satire.<br /><br />A single episode in the film encapsulates everything that is wrong with it. In the novel, recruit Juan Rico questions the value of learning infantry tactics with \\"obsolete\\" weapons on the grounds that both the Federation and any possible opponent will have thermonuclear weapons and push-putton delivery systems. His drill sergeant gives him a short lecture on the benefits of limited war and the need to have a capability across the whole spectrum of possible combat.  This was pretty radical in the 1950s when the military strategy of the US was totally based on massive push-button nuclear attacks (even on the territory of our allies in Europe).<br /><br />In the movie, Sgt. Zim pins Rico's hand to a wall with a thrown knife and snarls, \\"They can't push any buttons if you cripple their hands!\\"  Quite aside from the fact that VOLUNTEER recruits couldn't be physically assaulted in any real army, what is this idiotic response supposed to mean to the viewer?  Is it a crude attempt to imply that all armies are run by mindless, cruel people like Zim?  If so it indicates either that Verhoeven is an idiot, or he thinks his target audience is.  Is there some other, subtle meaning to this scene?  I have a Ph.D. in astrophysics and I sure can't detect one.<br /><br/>Sometimes when works of art turn out hopelessly bad, people strain to explain it as some kind of subtle satire. That may be true in some cases, but Verhoeven's films just show that he has a low, crude mind and doesn't know how to make movies with any kind of message.
B00003CX5P|3.0|When I think of the difference between the original 3 Star Wars movies and this one, the word that comes to mind is \\"swashbuckling\\".  <br /> <br />There was a kind of Errol-Flynn-wink-to-the-camera while swordfighting bravura to the first three films. They didn't take themselves too seriously. This covered up two shortcomings:  <br /> <br />1. The plot, for all of its Joseph Campbell overtones, is basically a comic book.   <br /> <br />2. George Lucas is an emotionally distant director who has difficulty soliciting great emotional performances from actors.  <br /> <br />Lucas can't seem to decide where he wants to go in this film. Jar-Jar is a bust at comic relief. I think of Princess Leia (saying of Chewbacca) \\"Will someone get this walking carpet out of my way?.\\" Jar-Jar deserves much worse, but it seems like there is a code of trans-species politcal correctness that is now observed. Poor Jake Lloyd (Anakin Skywalker) and his Pernilla August (his mother, Shmi Skywalker) have some of the most stilted and poorly directed dialog I have heard in a major movie. Lucas isn't emotionally tone-deaf, but his range is very limited.  <br /> <br />Lucas is still at master at getting great bang for the buck, the film is sumptuous and stunning. The pod race scene is great fun. You can get lost in the eye candy details he provides. I thought some of the costumes were a little over the top, but on the whole great fun.   <br /> <br />I just wish Mr. Lucas wouldn't take the rest of this so seriously. It's a Saturday Matinee, George, the force will take care of itself without getting too preachy about it. Have fun!
B00006LLLN|5.0|I have always liked bluegrass, but never purchased anything of the genre. From time to time it has provided a pleasant backdrop to whatever I was doing. I must have heard some of her songs, but the name Allison Krauss meant nothing to me. Then last May she came into my life when she appeared on a Memorial Day concert on PBS and I was mesmerized.  She has the voice of an angel as many have described. The words that come to my mind are ethereal and haunting. I made it a point to remember her name and got this CD soon after. Since then it has had close to the sole position of the CD of choice during my daily commute. Union Station is wonderful too and has some of the best songs on the CD, but Allison steals the show! Does she ever come to Los Angeles?
B0002JJBZE|1.0|First fans after a long wait purchased one-episode-per-VHS tape. <br />Then they remastered them and re-sold them again as definitive prints suitable for the serious fan. <br />Then fans purchased what the studio said was a digital version for lifetime enjoyment on the 12\\" laser disc format (2 episodes per LD) <br />Then after the industry dumped LD's and the studios released them on DVD at 2 per disc. <br />Now Paramount is again releasing them, this time in boxed Season sets at an unheard of price. <br /> <br />Just a word of warning...Star Trek's 40th anniversary is coming up...and I'm willing to bet they will be remastered in high definition WITH meaningful complete commentaries on every episode. <br /> <br />So once everyone has a copy of these boxed season sets sold at a high price  I bet paramount will release the complete series as a single boxed set (after all there are only 3 season) cheaper than the 3 invidual boxed sets.
B00011RPB0|1.0|Man, what a boring film!  Different, but boring.  Different because it is an American film pretending to be a European one.  How it got rave reviews is beyond me.  Is it because Sofia Copolla made it?   If she made a 3-hour feature with nothing but asses crapping from beginning to end, the critics would go \\"ooooh, aaaah!\\"   <br /> <br />The Japanese were shown in very bad light - merely as a bunch of buffoons and intruders.    <br /> <br />On the merit side, both lead characters looked convincingly bored throughout the film (they were probably stunned into looking that way from reading the script).  That should explain all the awards. <br /> <br />I normally prefer to complete watching a movie once I've started.  I agonized through this one.   <br /> <br />I agree with one of the reviewers.  Sofia ought to return her awards. <br /> <br />You think this critique (or whatever) is juvenile?  Wait till you watch the film! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I like this album, and I don't want to get involved in all these arguments, I just want to give my opinion. <br />I bought this album after I heard \\"cold hard bitch\\" on the radio, and I didn't mind the other songs I had heard. I didn't listen to it for a while because it has anti-copy on it and I couldn't put it on my mini-disc. So my father took off with it and he thought it was great, so I stole it back and decided I should listen to it properly. <br />I prefer the slower songs on this album. Whether they're better or not I couldn't tell you, I'm only giving my opinion. <br /> <br />My favourite songs would be: <br />- \\"move on\\" <br />- \\"lazy gun\\" <br />- \\"timothy\\" <br />- \\"cold hard bitch\\" <br />- \\"Sgt. Major\\" (this must be a bonus track or something, but it's my favourite) <br /> <br />I know this album sounds a lot like bands from the 70s and 80s, but compared to other things that get played on the radio they're pretty good. <br /> <br />And they don't sound much like the Beatles to me, so I don't know where that came from. <br />
B00005JMX6|4.0|That pretty much says it all. While the lead actor is no Tom Cruise and the hooker is now a porn star, this is still basically the same movie. Updated for today's more edgier generation, the movie is entertaining and goes well with a popcorn and a soda. It just isn't original.
1402581386|4.0|We've had quadriplegic detectives, drunken PIs, little old lady investigators, ethically challenged policemen, and a myriad other crime solvers who have various physical and mental quirks. So how can we come up with a new and unique expert crime investigator? Well, why hasn't anyone ever thought of it before, a police department employee who solves serial killer crimes, and is himself a serial killer? As the eminent Thomas Henry Huxley said after reading Darwin's new book on evolution in 1859,  \\"Why didn't I think of that.?\\"<br /><br /> Our hero (?) is Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter specialist with the Miami police department. Dexter murders people in his free time, and happily admits that he is a sociopath, and, in his own terms, is really not quite human. Though he has a girlfriend, for the sake of appearances, he has no sexual desires, and is incapable of love. He does care for his sister who is a cop, and decides to help her find a serial killer. It's really difficult for him to do this, as he greatly admires the technique of the man he sets out to apprehend.<br /><br />How on earth can we God fearing readers identify with a sociopathic killer, and wish him well? Well, for one thing, he is often quite witty, and that goes a long way with me. And he isn't a boozer or a womanizer -in fact he rejects the advances of a female detective-, and those are kind of good traits I guess. He is also a pretty good sleuth as well he should be, having the same hobby as the man he is chasing.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in how things worked out, as the author injects a bit of farfetchedness into the final part, but this is the first of a series, and I am looking forward to the next book. I am also booking a special appointment with my psychiatrist in an effort to find out why I would actually like this sort of story.
B000001FI7|5.0|On \\"Dummy\\", Portishead became one of the first electronic groups to prove that electronica doesn't need to be souless.  On the tragic \\"Roads\\", lead singer Beth's vocals are heartbreaking and beautiful.  It's a song that continues to give me goosebumps.  \\"Dummy\\" is definitaly worth the money. ;)
B00006EXL5|5.0|This record has been out for over two years now and I'm still as excited when I hear it as I was the first time.  As soon as I heard the demo for \\"Vampires Will Never Hurt You,\\" I was torn between eagerly anticipating the forthcoming full-length and steeling myself to be let down by a record that would not be as good as the demo.  I was not disappointed.  MCR has gathered quite a large following in the last two years and they have deserved all of the attention they've been getting.  This is an essential record for anybody who listens to underground rock.  It is certainly a refreshing change from the whining-about-girls-who-dumped-me-while-barely-concealing-my-own-misogyny music that barely passes for rock these days.
B00005JMUA|3.0|It's probably a good thing that Volume One and Volume Two of KILL BILL were never combined: there appear to be two different audiences that appreciated each one and probably would've been less enthused about one film.<br /><br />Volume One appeared to satisfy those who enjoyed fast-moving action and cartoonish bloodshed.<br /><br />Volume Two played to those who favor character and emotional development.<br /><br />I watched Volume Two even though I thought Volume One was thin and overrated.  And, no matter how good Two may be, it still has to take its story and characters from One.  Two makes a valiant effort, helped primarily by outstanding performances from Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and David Carradine, but it ends up trying to develop a deeper film from essentially a kung-fu parody.  (The tinny dramatic chords from 70's chop-socky movies reminds you of that throughout Two).<br /><br />Still, the lightest Tarantino fair is still more interesting than most movies out today.<br /><br />After reading this week that Tarantino plans to combine the films and rerelease them, I just hope he doesn't make more of KILL BILL than there really is.
B000069AUI|5.0|Anyone who gives this album less than four stars has no grasp of what good music is.  The lyrics are insightful, the music mellow and reflective, and Chris Martin's vocals are even better than on \\"Parachutes.\\"  If you find this music boring or trite, you clearly are not actually listening to the words and chords.  Take a moment to appreciate true artistry and give this album a try.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This movie is a beautiful movie with great emotion, love and actionscenes (The sinking of the ship) <br /> <br />Leonardo DiCaprio is good in his rol and plays his part perfect. <br />Kate Winslet also plays a great part. <br />The love story is perfectly worked out and gives you a great love feeling. <br />You also get to understand how it was to live on that ship for a long time.  <br />The sinking of the ship is spectular and very tence. <br /> <br />A great classic!
B00009UW0N|5.0|ok, i'm 16. i know i am the generation that is supposed to be like \\"oh my god, i love scream, urban legend is so scary, uhh\\". well, i guess i am a bad egg. i tried to watch those movies, and i gave up on the horror genre. i went to blockbuster the other night, looking for a movie, when i passed by a ton of horror movies i have never seen. halloween, friday the 13th, the original dawn of the dead(there was an original?!), the omen, the shining, the exorcist, many more. i was like, oh great, more shallow dumbass horror flicks. well, i looked at the box, and not only did the stories intrigue me, but i saw that they were made in the 70's and 80's. i have seen comedies from those times, and i thought that the grainy and dark feel of the camera back then would work great for a horror film. so, i picked up halloween and the omen, i could only get one, so i got halloween for the cool holographic cover. i went home and watched it, and i was scared out of my mind. the shape stands and you are like, come on, kill her already so the suspense doesn't make my head explode!! But he doesn't, and then when you are like least expecting it, he jumps out of nowhere and strangles or stabs someone. it is terrifying. i couldn't stop jumping, and the movie feels so dark and, it is really hard to explain, but it feels great. even the brightest days seem dark after watching halloween. but get this, next week my birthday came up. my parents let me rent many movies for my birthday present, so i rented the omen, the shining, friday the 13th, the exorcist, a nightmare on elm street, and all of these other horror movies i had never heard of but they were made in the 70's 80's so i decided to rent them. i loved them! they scared the sh*t out of me! they were terrific. halloween and the texas chainsaw massacre(original) are my favorite movies to date. i haven't seen many, but i know horror is now my favorite genre. the halloween sequels are a bore though, so skip them. actually, the third one is fun to watch and scary and original, and had that dark feel that most movies from the great days of horror have. i also recommend friday the 13th(the sequels are all cool), nightmare on elm street(the sequels are cool), tourist trap, the omen(the sequels just don't live up to it, so they pretty much suck), the texas chainsaw massacre(i am suprised to say that the remake was also good, it had the feel of a horror movie, i didn't feel like i was watching scream for a second), freddy vs. jason(i think new movies that are based on old horror flicks are usually good, maybe that's it), and there are many others, just look around. buy halloween, that is the only horror movie i own right now, and every REAL horror fan should have it.n to watch and scary and original, and had that dark feel that most movies from the great days of horror have. i also recommend friday the 13th(the sequels are all cool), nightmare on elm street(the sequels are cool), tourist trap, the omen(the sequels just don't live up to it, so they pretty much suck), the texas chainsaw massacre(i am suprised to say that the remake was also good, it had the feel of a horror movie, i didn't feel like i was watching scream for a second), freddy vs. jason(i think new movies that are based on old horror flicks are usually good, maybe that's it), and there are many others, just look around. buy halloween, that is the only horror movie i own right now, and every REAL horror fan should have it.
B000286S8S|4.0|I should (and I did) rate this cd based solely on it's own merit independent of other issues (read second paragraph).  It is what it claims to be; a greatest hits compilation.  Van Halen is a great rock and roll band and the music proves it.  If you are one of those people out there considering making this your first Van Halen cd then I say go for it.  This two cd set has great songs by one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time.  Keep in mind that these songs are \\"hits\\" (or were at one point).  This doesn't mean that you won't find better VH songs on regular studio releases that didn't qualify as a \\"hit\\".  For example:  \\"So This Is Love\\", \\"Somebody Get Me a Doctor\\", \\"Romeo Delight\\" and \\"5150\\" to name a few that you won't find on this cd set.  If by some wild & insane chance \\"It's About Time\\" is the first Van Halen song you've ever heard, and you are considering purchasing this cd based on the sound of that song you might (or not) be disappointed.  \\"It's About Time\\" is considerably different and not exactly representative of VH's greatest hits.  The packaging includes a nice summary of the band's history for those that are not familiar with it.  For two cd's worth of Van Halen this is worth buying.  I suppose it also depends on how you look at the 3 new and 3 live tracks;  bonus or filler?<br /><br />FROM A LONG TIME FAN'S PERSPECTIVE:<br />  This cd did not need to be released.  Van Halen could have gone on tour with sold out shows across the country without this compilation of hits.  I'd like to see some statistics showing how many new fans they actually gained by putting out this two cd package.  I have a suspicion that the only real goal with this cd was to milk all of the pre-existing fans (like myself) for as much money as possible.  How disappointing!  As much as I want to see them perform live again, I still think they should have taken the time to record and release a complete new studio album before starting the tour.  Had they omitted the 3 new songs from the \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation I'd probably feel differently, but it's obvious that the die hard VH fans who have been anticipating new music from these guys for a number of years will spend the money just to get the new songs.  Maybe they should have released them as singles.  Better yet; Compile the new songs along with \\"Humans Being\\", \\"Crossing Over\\", \\"Mean Wise Magic\\", and \\"Can't Get This Stuff No More\\" (and any other odd VH stuff) for the long-time die-hard fans so we don't have to spend the money on the Greatest hits and Best Of cd's.<br />  On a positive note, I like the 3 new songs.  \\"Up For Breakfast\\" is my favorite of the 3.  In response to an earlier reviewer who stated that the lyrics were not mature enough and were insulting to their intelligence, I say perhaps you're in search of a business journal, a science book, or fine literature.  Van Halen is a rock and roll band pure and simple.  If you want to hear a message or fight for a cause look elsewhere.  If you want to hear some damn good rock and roll music then nobody does it better than Van Halen.the \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation I'd probably feel differently, but it's obvious that the die hard VH fans who have been anticipating new music from these guys for a number of years will spend the money just to get the new songs.

B000002MFN|5.0|I remember when this album came out in 1992, I was a huge Madonna fan (still am, of course).  But I remember both this album and the 'Sex' book were not what I expected from Madonna.  They were dark, at times somber, and very adult.  At the time I was 16, and it was clear Madonna was not marketing this to her teenage fan base, so I was not able to appreciate the themes that both the book and the album raised. <br /> <br />Now that I'm older and I have been through some relationships and explored my sexuality, I have come to appreciate and love this album.  'Erotica' is one of Madonna's most personal albums.  Unlike 'Like A Prayer', 'Erotica' is more adult, addressing issues of power struggles in relationships ('Bye Bye Baby', 'Waiting'), S&M ('Erotica'), homosexuality and AIDS ('In This Life', 'Why's It So Hard') and even hints of maternal longing ('Secret Garden').   <br /> <br />The music combines house music and hip-hop courtesy of producers Shep Pettibone (who does the house songs) and Andre Betts (who provides the hip-hop sounds).  I wish Madonna worked with Betts more because their three songs, 'Waiting', 'Where Life Begins' and 'The Secret Garden', are standouts.  Each song has a jazzy, hip-hop feel that would be explored more on 'Bedtime Stories' (1994) but not as creatively.   <br /> <br />The dance songs 'Erotica', 'Deeper and Deeper' and 'Fever' are still hot today, although the video remix of 'Fever' is superior to the rather standard album version here.   <br /> <br />'Erotica' still sounds fresh today because Madonna's fusion of hip-hop and house sounds is still heard on radio and in clubs.  It is definitely worth another listen to appreciate an album that was lost amidst the critical bashings and hype in 1992.
B00009ATIX|4.0|I clearly need to go back and rewatch the Andrei Tarkovsky <br />version, but as i just watched the Clooney one it strikes me <br />that Solaris is a representation of a Heaven. <br /> <br />Rheya gets there the old fashioned way -- she dies on earth. <br />But the scientists get there the wrong way (by travelling to  <br />the space station). <br /> <br />It's a view of Heaven where you get to spend eternity with  <br />the the ones you love (not the one with the angels playing <br />harps on clouds, or being absorbed into a universal  <br />consciousness), living in the place you love the most, at  <br />peace and complete safety <br /> <br />i'm not saying that the space station is some idyllic paradise; <br />or that it would be possible to travel to the surface of solaris <br />to experience it -- but the energy of Solaris is the combined <br />Souls off all the inhabitants (so maybe it is the universal <br />consciousness version of Heaven as well)
B00028HBKM|2.0|Despite Mel Gibson's claims of good intention, this film did nothing to help me understand nor believe the story of Jesus other than a over-dramatized work of fiction. But it did reinforce my belief that governments and religion simply do not mix, even to this day.
B000002KDZ|5.0|This band rocks. I am fortunate that local bands such as Malo and Santana still play regularly in the Bay Area. Nena, Cafe, and Suavecito alone makes this album a must have. The music is timeless and even my kids love to hear it. This album is not one to pass up. Tony Sandoval from KISS FM played Nena recently and got flooded with callers wanting to know the song and the band. It's Malo folks. Go out and get it.

B00028HBKM|2.0|Anyone who's faith is strengthened by such a brutally violent movie needs to rethink about their faith.  This movie teaches little if anything about the life and teachings of Jesus.  It is nothing more then a 2 hour movie about medievil torture tactics. <br /> <br />Mel should have focused more on Jesus' life rather then His death.
B00008973Q|5.0|Yes... yes I am. <br /> <br />Akira Kurosawa's Ran is one of those very rare films that is capable of making me actually stop and say, \\"no way.\\" Kurosawa has managed to craft a liberal retelling of Shakespeare's King Lear into a heartwrenching, almost totally crushing vision of the pathetic human condition that actually makes Shakespeare's point better than the Bard did himself. [Wait on those torches and pitchforks! Hear me out!] By removing the Edmund and Edgar subplot, Kurosawa has also oblitered the single hopeful aspect of the play [Edgar triumphs, Edmund gets his just desserts]. What remains is the central tale of an old king (not a hugely sympathetic figure thanks to his rather brutal past and on-screen pride, but still worthy of respect) being ground into the dirt and, eventually, killed. (The death of Lear is no less a murder than the death of Hidetora.) This happens through the treachery, avarice, and sheer lust for power of the king's children, who eventually drive him insane. In one sense, this is an extremely unpleasant movie to watch-- as the last shot so articulately shows us, the central message of the film is that \\"man is born crying and when he has cried enough, he dies.\\" Religion and friendship fall by the wayside in a film just as likely to make you weep from the sheer power of its argument as from the force of its filmaking. <br /> <br />...Which is nonetheless considerable. The much-referenced assault on the Third Castle is without a doubt one of the most stunningly perfect sequences ever put on film-- stunning no less because of its graphic depiction of the horrors of war than because of the lingering shots of the crazed Hidetora, unable even to kill himself, capable only of sitting in abject horror as flaming arrows rip through the air near him and all of his companions die around him. The sheer amount of suffering conveyed to us, both through the color palette of firey reds and smokey blacks and through the soundless screams of the wounded holding their own limbs or crawling towards the pig troughs for a final drink, is simply unbearable. The bright red blood draws attention to both itself and the entire subtle wrongness of the sequence-- is this really human nature? Hidetora's reaction to the carnage becomes the viewer's own-- wordless, wide-eyed astonishment. Wide-eared, as well, since the sequence would not be half so affected if not accompanied by a slow, moving tune that only makes us more aware of the noises of battle that we can't hear, but imagine more vividly than we would like. The rifle shot that ends this tune (generally inciting a slight jerk on the part of the audience) is mechanized and harsh, and signals (after a short flurry of sound) a blasted silence as Hidetora walks, stunned, out of the castle. This sequence, while a perfect example of the amount of pure artistry present in this film, is by no means alone in its astonishingness; the entire film is a work of genius. <br /> <br />As for the much-maligned DVD transfer, I'm afraid that I have no real basis of comparison as I have only ever seen the Masterworks Edition. As a little bit of a purist (I don't watch pan-and-scan), I do find myself disturbed by the things that other reviews point out; however, they obviously detracted little from my viewing experience. All-in-all, I would say that the current DVD is passable, but I look forward with great anticipation to a future version that truly respects this masterpeice (and doesn't have obvious subtitle typos that make the viewer snicker). <br /> <br />In short, this movie is quite possibly my candidate for \\"greatest film ever made.\\" It paints a deeply despairing, nihilistic picture of both human nature and the world as a whole, and does so with a brutally ruthless frankness that I have seen almost nowhere else.  Artistically, it is practically without fault-- powerful and moving, it is practically a \\"how-to\\" of effective moviemaking. I cannot recommend Ran too highly.
B000286S8S|2.0|Love Van Halen and most, if not all, of these songs are great, but the release of this was unnecessary and in my opinion put together for nothing more than just to milk more money for stuff we already own (just like morons who bought Guns N' Roses \\"Greatest Hits\\") <br /> <br />First off, almost all of these songs we already have on The Best of Volume 1 released in late 1996.  Now that was a good Greatest Hits package.  This one here is essentially the same thing with a few extra live tracks and three new \\"average at best\\" studio tracks with Sammy Hagar.  I would have thought a new studio album with Hagar to be released given the hype and rumors for the better part of four years surrounding Van Halen, yet we get another greatest hits package. <br /> <br />There will be no follow-up to Best of Volume 1 which now makes that title and release look like a case of leprosy.  And even if we do get a Greatest Hits Volume 2, another greatest hits package will just tarnish everything.   <br /> <br />We didn't need this, people.  And for all of you who have bought this and already own Greatest Hits Voume 1, you basically just wasted your money.  The new songs and the live stuff IS NOT worth spending 20 bucks or more on.
B00008OWZC|4.0|The sound is great, the music is great. It's real CDDA, too (props to Atlantic for not screwing us over with a copy-protected album). Read the other reviews. <br /> <br />...the problem is the case. With all this CD rot and things going around, it just doesn't seem right to have to bend the CD a full inch to remove it each time. If the case were to use the mechanisms of Black Sabbath's Reunion, or the Black Crows' The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, it would have 5 stars.
B0002I831S|5.0|Just received the new DVD Star Trek TOS 1st Season Set.  Simply put . . . the packaging stinks and is not user friendly.

The Bones in me had to come out! <br /> <br />Sorry . . . <br /> <br />As for the content . . . it's top notch and worth the money. <br />Sound is wonderful . . . and the quality of the video seems on par with the lastest compression standards.

0743454529|4.0|I enjoyed this book for its hard look at the moral consequences of modern medicine, and the ethical dilemmas faced by families coping with grave illness.         But the \\"surprise ending\\" was a dud.  It avoided having to face, and live with, the consequences of the issues confronted in the rest of the book.  It is as if the author couldn't face the difficult, and true, issues that were meant to be the focus of the story.     A coward's ending.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Unlike other movies, the Passion of the Christ was not made to provide entertainment. It was made to inspire us. It was made to show us the very meaning of the true love that God has for us.  Few words are spoken - however the visual images tell the entire story. the silent suffering of our Lord and Savior is presented to us in the most dramatic and Biblically accurate way it could be. Watch this movie again and again, not the be entertained but rather to find your faith. Those without faith in the Gospel will reject this film as violent and meaningless gore, but those who believe will find the Passion to be the greatest movie they have ever seen because it vividly presents the most significant event in the history of mankind- the saving our eternal souls. the event had to be as violent as it was depicted because our sins are great. Jesus died to pay the penality for every sin committed by everyone who repents and confesses Him as Lord. The cost was very great and had to be depicted as it was, because it was done for you and me and everyone who believes in it. Watch the film and pray about its message, over and over again, every day.

B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie had a deeply profound affect on me, not my religious beliefs, not my historical knowledge, but on ME as a person. Despite all the rhetoric involved in the release, the promotion and the hype it clearly sends a message to humanity.....to suffer for your fellow man is the ultimate sacrifice but it will lead to the greatest of honor. <br /> <br />This extraordinary film is the re-enactment of the passion as explained in the four books of the Gospel. It helps to read these books prior to the film if you are not familiar with the story or if you want to be able to compare and contrast Gibson's idea to the truth as told within the Bible. Most of the film is very dark but brings to light historical figures that lived in a time of horrible brutality. If crimes were punished in a similar way today I doubt we would have many criminals! Christ knows his direction in life and has willingly accepted his own death in order to save the sins of humanity. Whether or not you believe the religious theory behind this sacrifice the story represents what all humans should be willing to do for the life of another. This movie is absolutely brutal and so graphic that the faint at heart will have to turn away, but don't, the least we can do for this historical figure is watch a movie that depicts His suffering. As for the anti-Semitism that was so widely touted I didn't see it. To be honest with you I felt angrier at the Romans for the relentless beating they gave to Christ. But it isn't a class, gender or race issue that is involved in this story it is about humanity as a whole and how we resort to violence instead of acceptance towards the things we don't understand. All creeds, religions and sects have authorized brutal killings for the sake of their faith so no one is more able to wipe their hands of Christ's death than any other. <br /> <br />James Caviezel plays the part of Jesus Christ with such perfection you will feel as though you have been transported back in time and are actually meeting the image of the man Himself. This role required a great deal from Caviezel, demanding endurance and exhibiting compassion without going overboard as so many other actors have done in the past. The film is spoken in Aramaic and Latin (with sub-titles) and Caviezel is flawless in his accent bringing even more depth to his portrayal. By the end of this movie the only thing that can move on Caviezel is his eyes and in those last subtle shifts of movement his acting becomes something phenomenal. Beside Caviezel in her role as Mary Magdalene is Monica Bellucci whose loyalty and soft determination follows Christ to His grave along with Mother Mary (played by Maia Morgenstern). The women are the strength of this film just as I imagine them to have been in real life although they were ostracized by the men who wrote the Bible. Rosalinda Celentano is the ever present Satan that horrible evil that lurks in every nook and cranny of this film and she is downright scary. Caiphas is presented as a vindictive man and is played nicely by Mattia Sbragia. Close to Caviezel in excellence is Hristo Shopov cast as the powerful but weak Pontius Pilate. The truly amazing thing is that none of the actors in this film are really \\"stars\\" but they all succeed in their roles with a grace and spirit that stands above the fluff and muster of Hollywood.  <br /> <br />Mel Gibson has done something here that surpasses bravery, he has taken a highly controversial subject (religion and faith), stayed very close to the story as told in the Gospels and dared to put his own funding up to support it, so is he crazy or was he driven to bring a taste of faith back into a hollow humanity. Not only is this film beautiful to watch but it is as accurate a story as can be told based upon historical and religious records. The music is haunting and magical. The use of foreign language a feat in its own right for American audiences who would rather eat popcorn than read subtitles. But Gibson'sreal gift is how he manages to inspire something in people who see this film, it may be tears, compassion, renewed faith, anger, spite or indifference but at least it stirs up something in a massive audience of people who all too often don't have to feel anything while watching a film. If you don't walk away from this film feeling changed inside and willing to see Christ as a human being who loved more than himself then the sadness rests with you.  <br />
B00005T7I1|3.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3KORRNVXNTW6U]]I'm not the biggest fan of Dick Tracy and outside of this movie I couldn't tell you anything about him other than he's an honest cop who favors yellow and he's been around for a long time.<br /><br />Comic-book movies are a dime a dozen these days so maybe now Dick Tracy doesn't stand out as much as it did in 1990, a shame because Warren Beatty's color scheme and attention to detail is quite impressive. And the film did win 2 Academy Awards for the art direction and the gruesome make-up. I think Disney were shooting for a successful franchise in the vein of Burton's Batman the previous year. The films are very similar visually and it's a shame we never got more Dick Tracy movies.<br /><br />The plot is nonsense, some Gangster called 'Big Boy Caprice (played by an over-the-top Al Pacino in such eccentric make-up it actually looks like Antoine de Caunes playing Al Pacino playing Big Boy) wants to take control of 'the city' and Dick Tracy does his best to take him down. Madonna pops up as a floozy and the wretched kid who played Peter Pan's son in Hook pops up as...um...'The Kid'. Amidst these unremarkable plot developments dozens of grotesque gangsters bicker and mumble and fill up the running time. It's not so much fun following the plot as it is keeping your eyes open for all the actors hidden underneath the make-up. Such as William Forsythe, Ed O'Ross, Paul Sorvino, RG Armstrong and Dustin Hoffman, who is hilarious as Mumbles. It really makes you think about how successful actors can be identified by their unique voices or by their eyes.<br /><br />Some of it is rather dull but there are moments of spectacle that make it worthwhile. The matte paintings and color schemes are truly wonderful, turning the movie into a modern day film noir. Danny Elfman however, cranks out YET ANOTHER generic, lifeless comic-book movie score that brings no life of it's own the images on screen. He's truly my least favorite film composer (tying with Randy Edelman). But it did win another Academy Award for 'Best Original Song' as well as being nominated for 4 others.<br /><br />There have been rumors for years that Beatty's cut of the film was 135 minutes long and that Disney demanded that he cut it down to 105. This seems to make sense regarding some unusual edits in certain scenes and the fact that all of a sudden the movie is set on New Year's Eve during the climax despite the fact that it is clearly not winter nor is there any mention of Xmas (much like Ghostbusters II).<br /><br />Disney seem to hate the movie, despite its success, and I'm not surprised considering the massive legal trouble it brought them with various rights disputes over the years, which is why there was never any sequel. Beatty still retains the rights and promises that there WILL be another Dick Tracy, but the dude was born in 1937. He can't play Dick Tracy anymore unless the movie will be set in the 1960s.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks and sounds great in 1.85:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are no extras!man).

B0002XVQNU|5.0|I read the book adaptation of the film Daredevil and was disappointed to see that much of the story was cut out of the film by the studio.  I liked the movie, but I liked the WHOLE story much better.  In this version you get to see what brings the Kingpin down and how Matt Murdock uses his senses as a blind superhero and lawyer to free an innocent man. GREAT.
B000244FDW|5.0|I like this BBC 1980 version better than the BBC 1996 remake. This version seems to have more depth than the 1996 remake and I suspect this is because it was produced more like a theatrical play rather than a film.  Also, I think it may contain more dialogue from the book(?).  It didn't have as big a budget as the 1996 remake but nevertheless the scenery, costumes and locations are lovely.  Elizabeth Garvie is wonderful as Elizabeth Bennet.  She has a beautiful voice and some of her facial expressions are funny.  Although I thought Jennifer Ehle was good in the 1996 version, she smiles too much which annoyed me after a while.  I am also one of the few who prefer David Rintoul over Colin Firth as Darcy.  I thought Colin Firth brought too much emotion to the part of Darcy.  He seemed, at times, to appear vulnerable and that's not how Darcy appears.  I agree that Rintoul could have been less stiff but all in all I think there is great chemistry between him and Garvie.  The scene where they bump into each other at Pemberly is wonderful.  Astonishment, confusion, embarrassment, kindness, are wonderfully acted out between them.  I like all of the other actors.  I don't find any character to be over-exaggerated.  In the 1996 remake, Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins were over the top.  So I recommend this.

6305014140|5.0|An exhilarating story about deadly ninjas, lightning-fast swordfights and battles with bizarre demons. The violent and sexual scenes in the movie make it suitable only for adult audiences. The devils that the hero, Jubei, fought against all have their unique lethal ability and costume. Each battle is exciting because Jubei always seems to be overmatched by his opponent and so the viewer has to watch each battle to the end. The devil Yurimaru's costume and appearance reminded me very much of the character \\"Kojiro Sasaki\\" in the Musashi Miyamoto trilogy.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I come to this review a Christian woman strong in the faith of God, but will try to review using my intellect.  Whether you believe that Christ is the Savior of man, this movie can be appreciated for its bravery.  I kept thinking \\"when will this end,\\" even though I knew exactly when.  The sobs were caught so deeply in my throat that I could hardly breath.  That any man, and regardless of belief, he was a man as well as God so his doubts and constant fight for faith that what was happening to him was for the greater good is to be understood.  The pain that was endured so that ALL could know the Lord even though we are completely unworthy is astounding.  I knew what would happen and I thought that I was prepared.  I was wrong.  Even my wildest imagination could not have conceived the agony of these final hours.  I have read many reviews on this movie that are fighting about the nature of His love rather than the Nature of His death.  But really, don't they go hand in hand?  Who but someone who loves with every fiber of His soul could endure this kind of torture for the salvation of those that he loved?  Would I lay down my life for my children?  In a heartbeat.  Would I endure unimaginable torture to spare them from the very same?  Without doubt!  Would the pain cause me to waiver?  Quite possibly.  Would I continue anyway?  Beyond question.  This was a movie that left me wanting to consider the great and horrible things that all mankind is capable of and how I could make a difference.  Just watch and ask yourself if you could do the same for those that you love.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|It's about time Peter Gabriel came out with a best of collection, this was long overdue.  While many of the songs on this 2 CD set are quite good, I have just a few disappointments to share.  First off, why oh why is: \\"In Your Eyes\\" on the \\"Miss\\" CD?  That song was a hit song from day one.  Also, what happened to songs like \\"Come Talk To Me\\", \\"I Have The Touch\\", and \\"Washing Of The Water\\"? <br /> <br />  Instead, Gabriel included totally ridculous songs on this compliation like \\"Cloudless\\" \\"The Tower That Ate The People\\", and \\"Signal To Noise\\".  What in the hell was he thinking?! <br />On the other hand I was very impressed with the live unreleased track on the \\"Miss\\" cd \\"Downside Up\\" a beautiful duet he sang live with his sister (I believe).   <br /> <br />  One Last complaint: another fan on here talked about how they cut off the beginnings of \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Don't Give Up\\" on this compilation.  Those intro's are what set the mood for these songs, an akward mistake for whoever thought that was a good idea. <br /> <br />  In my opinion the albums \\"So\\" and \\"Us\\" were PG's best albums along with the double live CD:  \\"Secret World\\".  This compilation does have a few gems to offer, but then again what Peter Gabriel CD doesn't?? <br />

Also this DVD will have deleted scenes and behind the scenes too! AND MOST IMPORTANTLY!!! JK ROWLING HERSELF APPROVES EVERYTHING ON THE FILMS AND LOVES THEM!!! IF THE AUTHOR SAYS THEY ARE GOOD THEN NO ONE ELSE SHOULD EVEN CRITICIZE!!!! I myself have been a fan for ages and this film just rocked! OK just had to make that apparent, watch this movie again or for the first time and watch all the DVD extras with open eyes!! Haryy Potter rocks and so does this movie!!
B000002H97|4.0|The \\"Black Album\\" as it is commonly known, was an enormous commercial success for Metallica and is considered by many to be their finest album.  While the songwriting on \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\" is some of Metallica's best work it doesn't live up to some earlier songs such as \\"Fade to Black\\" or \\"Welcome Home: Sanitarium\\".  Metallica simplied the song structured, and shortened the length of songs; songs like \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Sad but True\\", \\"Don't Tread on Me\\", \\"Through the Never\\" maintain dirty, heavy rhythms from beginning to end. Balance is given to the album through slightly less heavy songs such as \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\" Wherever I May Roam\\".  Then of course there is the ballad \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", a first for the band, which has received too much airplay over the years.  Like all Metallica albums, the B-sides, namely \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" and \\"My Friend of Misery\\", are on par with the band's best material.  For fans of Metallica this is still a must have, for those who find Metallica a little too heavy, its something to try out before moving on to the meatier albums.

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles' final effort, a compact disc of duets, has been described by one critic as being too pop-oriented, and flat.  Nothing could be further from the truth!!!    It is true that Ray's voice, by this juncture, had lost some of its power.  What his voice had not lost was its ability to convey emotion and meaning.    This compilation offers a little something for everyone.  From the country/blues/soul of HERE WE GO AGAIN with Norah Jones and DO I EVER CROSS YOUR MIND? with Bonnie Raitt, Ray synthesizes musical genres as he always had.    In spite of his declining health, Ray and Natalie Cole offer a spirited, saucy (and humerous) version of the Little Willie John penned FEVER; a song recorded first by John, and popularized by Peggy Lee.     The most unlikely pairing was Ray with Johnny Mathis on SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW.  Backed by Victor Vanacore's exquisite orchestrations, Ray's earthiness and Mathis' tender--and underrated--introspection go together like a hand in a glove.    Ray Charles, the creator of what would come to be called \\"Soul Music\\", still sits on his throne.  Buy with confidence.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I feel a bit sheepish rating something I haven't seen, but I think the early word says it all: no original versions. I does seem that Lucas is trying to impose his revision of history on us all. <br /> <br />But keep a few things in mind: the original Star Wars and Empire were great; Return was a bit disappointing (I think that Lucas was already starting to change then in 1983). And so the revisions, I thought actually helped Return: the celebrations on the other worlds he added at the end broke up the Ewok celebration, and made it SLIGHTLY easier to take. The revisions really hurt Star Wars (the now infamous Greedo scene, especially), but I don't remember it having much of an effect on me for Empire (far and away the best of the original 3--and incidentally the one that Lucas had the least to do with). <br /> <br />We all know how this will resolve itself. A few years after the last of these lame 3 new movies is out, a mega, super-expensive boxed set of pretty much everything will come out--including the originals of the first 3. I must say that it saddens me to think that Lucas really feels the need to milk (really exploit) fans that have made him so successful. Come on Lucas, give us a break.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avrils sophmore attempt is much better than her debt CD, Let Go.  Under my Skin is much more polished, and it seems like Avril is coming into her own as an artist.  The poser-ish vibe from her first CD isn't on this one here.  Under my Skin is pure rock, well, pop-rock, but rock nonetheless.  She isn't trying to be something she's not anymore, and it shows on the CD.  Angry heartbroken teenage girls will love this one.
B000005HLV|4.0|wow, i wish i had read the previous reviewer's thoughts on this album before i bought it. this is fairly solid black metal with some of the most atrocious vocals in existence. :) it's not overly technical, despite what some of the other reviewers have said (technical BM at its peak is really emporer on ix equilibrium, and also immortal... battles in the north! hail!)<br /><br />despite these criticisms, it really is fine black metal at its core. the guitar work is okay, the drums are reasonable, the production is suitably bad, and it is \\"moody\\" and \\"evil\\". just don't expect something technical, and steel your ears for the painful vox, and you'll enjoy it too. :)<br /><br />i suppose i should note that emporer is, imo, the first and last word in the BM dictionary. no one ever did it like they did, and no one will again. so maybe they spoiled me. :) i also highly recommend immortal in addition to (instead of?) mayhem. well, this album anyway. you can get battles in the north at *cough*centurymedia.com*cough* (hinthint, amazon!).
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Like how Eminem gets the whole \\"I wanna be black\\" idealism, Britney gets how to make annoying, not very good songs to be appealing to the mass public.  I can't even start on how many times I was hummung \\"Toxic\\" during the day.  That song alone is just genius.  Her voice leaves some to be desired, the beat is monotonous, but it works.  Somehow, the rest of the album works too.<br /><br />Good job, Britney.  \\"Everytime\\" was actually a really good song...a pleasant surprise to hear getting radio play amidst all the pop-punk and hip-hop influenced tunes.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|Absolution is a masterpiece, its contents ranging from the stunning  <br />melodic complexity of \\"Hysteria\\" to the soothing simplicity of \\"Endlessly\\". Tracks like \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" give off an distinct feeling of cold which leads temporarily into short but satisfying solution. Emotionally, the album is everywhere, and never fails to leave the listener feeling as if he/she were actually really there. The vocals, although mainly composed of only one layer, are intensely creative, blending in with bass and guitar melodies very well, yet clashing at the right moments, and seem to create a feeling where all sounds are naturally one. Chillingly truthful and real lyrics also add to the album, and although they sometimes do not seem to stand out much, are always true to the melody of the song. <br /> <br />Although the voice of Muse singer Matthew Bellamy is reminiscent of that of Radiohead's Thom York, it seems to pull off a completely different feel and heads in a new direction where Radiohead had never quite headed in. And while Muse may have had their share of influences, they still manage to sound unique and have never failed to impress.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke will forever stand out in my mind as a movie that acutally manages to avoid the cheap, inchaote good guys v. bad guys dichotomy. Mononoke has a good guy, but everyone else is full of true to life ambiguities. Simply put, the viewer can understand where each antagonism arises and festers. The main character thus stands out as a strange sort of Christ figure:  he refuses to damn the others and seeks to quietly do all that he can for anyone he can. <br />This is a highly imaginative film (as are all Miyazaki films), an full fledged action film, an ecological polemic, and, surprisingly, even a profound moral commentary. I highly recommend it.
0374250324|5.0|Author Tom Wolfe has given the public the consumate view of America's early Astronaut and NASA programs.  Although twenty-five years old at the time of this writing \\"The Right Stuff\\" is a book unparalleled!  I read the book after I saw the movie of the same name and believe that it was an accurate rendition of the story that Wolfe has portrayed.<br /><br />At 436 pages, the book will not be a completely detailed driven historical narrative on the subject, but Wolfe provides crucial insight into the backgrounds, lives, and personalities of the candidates, Astronauts, and key NASA personnel.  Nothing else needs to be said.  A great read!  I rate this book at five stars.  I also recommend Alan Shepard's book \\"Moon Shot\\" as a follow-up to this text.
B0001HLVS2|1.0|brilliant special effects. worst. plot. ever. if you like huge circles with no conclusion AT ALL (it's seriously a huge circular plot that sucks) and not being entertained (as well as the use of the \\"periscope shot\\" at least 28 times), then this movie is for you. if you actually like good movies, then stay away from this.
B0000C1733|2.0|This album is just not that great.  Songs like Californication, Under the Bridge, Higher Ground etc. made RHCP rightfully famous, but this album is not worth your time.   <br /> <br />I like a lot of stuff on this album, but most of the songs don't belong, making it hardly worth shelling out $15 (sometimes more). <br /> <br />If you like stuff like By the Way, Californication, or Scar Tissue, you should buy the Californication album and/or the By the Way album.  If you prefer their wild and crazy side--songs like Suck My Kiss, or Give It Away--get Blood Sugar Sex Magik or Uplift Mofo Party Plan. <br /> <br />Overall, this is for collectors only.  Too many songs have been left out, and replaced with unworthy ones

B00005JNEI|5.0|Clearly this is a movie with an agenda: to wake up America with the hopes of showing Bush the door in 2004.  It is all about igniting passions against what is portrayed as a corrupt and inept administration, not about presenting an unbiased look at Bush and Company.  Unlike certain \\"so-called\\" journalistic institutions on the Right, though, Michael Moore does not pretend to be \\"fair & balanced\\".  There is no pretense here.  The filmmaker is acting as a powerful advocate for his point of view, and in doing so, does not owe it to his audience to present \\"both sides of the story\\". <br /> <br />Lord knows we're bombarded with the \\"other side of the story\\" every day by an anything-but-liberal mass media that is increasingly wary of criticizing the Bush administration for fear of being blacklisted as unpatriotic.  (The movie itself almost didn't make it to the theaters when its original distributors pulled the plug, allegedly the result of Bush cashing in a political favor).  Let us make no mistake, though, whether you agree with Moore's point of view or not, and whether you have a favorable impression of the sitting administration or not, Michael Moore is indeed a patriot.  Contrary to what certain pundits and talk-radio hosts would have you believe, Michael Moore is not a flag burner, rather he embraces the flag, but more importantly, he embraces its true meaning.  Contrary to much of the movie's unfounded criticism, one only needs to see the first ten minutes to realize that the filmmaker is a man who truly loves America.  His mission in creating the film and criticizing the present administration is not to bring down America, but rather to save it from itself. <br /> <br />Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a perfect film, but its an important film.  Whether you sit on the right, on the left, or somewhere between, you owe it to yourself to see this film.  Whether or not you agree with the film's point of view, Michael Moore should be applauded precisely because he is sparking thesort of heartfelt debate in our society that has been silent since the horrors of September 11th.  For the three years since the attacks, we, as a society, have been understandably numb as we began to heal from the shock of the new reality that has been thrust upon us.  As the scabs of our wounds begin to peel, though, it is vital that we bring a spirit of discourse back to this country, lest this freedom we prize so dearly degenerate into nothing more than a kinder, gentler totalitarianism.
B00005JMUA|5.0|I loved Kill Bill Vol 1 and was one of the first in line to see the DVD of Kill Bill Vol 2.  I sure wasn't disappointed.  And I think that Quentin Tarantino is a genius, especially in the way the two films work together. Vol 1 was all action and not much story.  All the audience knew was that \\"the bride\\", played by Uma Thurman, who also was Tarantino's co-writer, was after revenge.  There was a lot of fighting and huge scenes where this lone woman battled hoards of assassins.  It was complete in and of itself.  And it seemed that the back-story didn't matter.<br /><br />But the back-story DID matter.  And that is what Vol 2 is about.  The audience has already gotten to know the characters and is also prepared for some incredibly horrific fighting that goes way over the top in violence.  I expected more of the same.  But that was not to be.  Instead, I was treated to a slow unfolding of a story.  The fighting was equally vile and wild, of course.  And there is one fight scene between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah that is guaranteed to make you wince.  But there were indeed fewer casualties in Vol 1 and some very tender moments too.  The characters grew in complexity, especially Bill, played by an aging David Carradine.  In this role he's the embodiment of evil, and yet his appeal is understandable.  Uma Thurman must have had to train round-the-clock to learn all the martial arts moves that this film required.  But there are some scenes in the film in which she has to use all her acting talent and show some real emotion in some incredible situations.  Her performance shines.<br /><br />If you're looking for a kind and gentle film, this is not the film for you.  But if you're looking for innovative filmmaking, unrelenting violence and complexity, you'll LOVE Kill Bill 2.  Highly recommended.

B0000696I0|4.0|America's favorite green teens are back in action and this time they got villians just like them. The Story continues When Splinter shows the turtles the empty canister that once had ooze that transformed him and the turtles 15 years ago. The canister matches events going on a TGRI:Techno Global Research Industries.The Turtles must find out \\"the secret of the ooze\\". The Shredder returns and wips out a plan to defeat the turtles, he forces Professer Jordan Perry,CEO of TGRI to mutate a Wolf and a snapping turtle into humanoid creatures. The same mutation that transformed the Turtles and Splinter,he names his creatures Toka and Razar. The Turtles soon stop Toka and Razar and defeat the Shredder. This sequel is awsome,more high kicking action,funny and entertaining, the Turtles still ruled in this one. I recommend this If you saw TMNT: The Movie and if you watched the show as a child. Bring home Mikey,Donny,Leo and Raph in their second high kicking adventure. \\"NEXT FIGHT WILL BE FREAK AGAINIST FREAK!
B00005JLEU|4.0|This is a cool DVD. Has a bonus one hour DVD showing how they made the movie and all the work that went into it. It is a great watch. The movie is very well done. Being that it is from Japan it does have some elements to it that Americans will find odd. I enjoyed this movie entirely. The \\"acting\\" is amazing for an animated film. Surpasses any Disney movie I have watched. Good story on friendships, family, integrity, respect....you name it. Your kids will enjoy this movie and so will you because it is so well done.
6303314015|5.0|I'm sorry, but if you found this movie to be too violent for kids over the age of five, then you're robbing your children of a valuable experience.  Yes, there is death.  Yes, it is not a safe and simple death.  But kids CAN handle it.  An evil man killed a great man.  It's not a theme that kids should enjoy, but it's one that is of particular resonance to us as Americans.  This movie is simple, beautiful and moving- seemingly one of Disney's last treasures.  While the Broadway show may be even more moving, this movie has the power to move us.  I hope you'll see it if you haven't.  I hope you'll let your kids watch it if you haven't.  And I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have.  Humbly submitted,   -Matt Calcara, Overland Park, KS
B00006DEFA|5.0|I bought this because I was curious about why someone from a hard rock, metal band would recommend this movie about Mozart?! <br />I understood why in an instant. The music is wonderful in this movie. The acting is superb. The story is timeless. The passion and love for music as music comes shining through!! Its amazing! He despises the very man whose music touches him so. It is what music is all about. Depicts the emotional aspect of music. Its not so much a movie of how \\"great\\" Mozarts music is. It is about loving music. If you are a musician this is a must buy. If you like a good movie that is very well acted then you will love this movie also.

B000002UYZ|1.0|In 1973 Apple/Capitol released the RED and the Blue albums,to chronicle the Beatles career. When released on vinyl the Red album was a two record set. However in the age of the compact disc,Apple/Capitol decided that they should release a 60 minute album(80 minutes of music can fit on a single CD)in a two CD set and sale it for about $32.00, when in all reality it should sale for $10-$14. All the hits you would expect are present, but the price of the CD is poor, and the sound quality could be better. I recommend purchasing The Beatles 1 instead.
B00005JMEW|4.0|The opening shot of \\"Kill Bill\\" is one of the most memorable I can recall: in stark black and white, a woman's face -- almost unrecognizable as Uma Thurman's at first -- spattered with blood, coated in sweat, a bridal veil spread out beneath her. She gasps, clearly in pain, as a hand reaches in to wipe some of the blood and sweat from her face with a handkerchief. The handkerchief bears the name \\"Bill\\" on it. A voice (Bill's, we presume) speaks to her. The Bride's first words, just preceding the gunshot which spatters more blood from her head onto the veil, are so surprising that I had to rewind the scene and watch it again just to be sure I heard them correctly.<br /><br />Starting from this provocative point, Tarantino weaves quite a story in \\"Kill Bill,\\" adopting his usual technique of starting somewhere in the middle, then jumping the audience forward and back in time to fill in the gaps. It took two films, clocking in at just over 4 hours total, to tell this story. It is both intricate and intriguing, and it stands out as a high-water mark in some ways for Tarantino, while maintaining much of what his diehard fans seem to love him for.<br /><br />I'm writing about both parts of \\"Kill Bill\\" mainly as a single film because that's the way I first watched them (one right after the other), and also because that is what Tarantino originally intended for them. Apart from a slightly cheesy \\"synopsis\\" segment at the beginning of Volume 2, they fit together almost seamlessly. It is my feeling that they are best watched in a single sitting, if at all possible.<br /><br />In terms of story, \\"Kill Bill\\" is Tarantino's best work since \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" (still my personal favorite in his brief but notable body of work). Tarantino keeps it moving at a brisk pace, rarely letting exposition slow down the action, but there is a lot of story here to tell. Each character gets their story told in turn, and the audience can quickly see how each individual character's story ties into the Bride's story, which is the main thrust of the film. Her tale of revenge against those who tried to kill her (and, obviously, failed) leads down a twisting path, drawing the audience deeper and deeper into the lives and motivations of everyone. The main theme of the film seemed to be summed up in the observation that the road to revenge leads through a thick forest, and it is often very easy to get distracted from the path.<br /><br />In Volume 1, the action sequences mostly overshadow the characters themselves, and the fight scenes are pretty memorable. Definitely not for the faint of heart, the fights are nevertheless somewhat cartoonish in their depiction of violence. They are mostly reminiscent of Japanese anime: literal geysers of blood, dozens of amputated limbs, improbable (but beautiful) sword work, moves that even the pros would envy deeply, and a great deal of variety in how people are hurt or killed all add up to some pretty solid action in Volume 1 of \\"Kill Bill.\\" This is almost assuredly not going to be for everyone, but fans of Tarantino's genre-bending ultra-violent style will surely be satisfied.<br /><br />What surprised me was that Tarantino was more emotionally honest in this film (particularly in Volume 1) than I've ever seen. Uma Thurman puts in a fine performance from the first frame to the last, and really balances the ferocity of her character with her more vulnerable moments. We get the impression that every emotion the Bride feels is felt deeply, whether grief or joy or rage. Part of this is due to Tarantino's grasp of good dialogue, and part due to a nicely turned performance from Thurman.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino seems to enjoy making genre movies but twisting the meaning of the genre, and he clearly has enough of an understanding for the genres he works in to manipulate them cleverly. His attention, in \\"Kill Bill,\\" to the samurai fighter movie is both homage and elevation of the genre. He pays it tribute by mirroring many of its techniques, and he makes it better by adding in some excellent dialogue and a well-crafted story.<br /><br />Tarantino fans should be (and, if you read other reviews, clearly are) well-pleased by what they find in \\"Kill Bill.\\" His ear for dialogue, his skill with a complex story, and his somewhat extreme sensibilities are all in strong evidence here. What I think is really good about \\"Kill Bill\\" is that even those who haven't liked Tarantino in the past may find something of value in this movie. If you can get past the occasional (OK, frequent) fountain of blood jetting from a combatant's severed limb and let yourself get into the story, you're in for a pretty fun ride.<br /><br />Two other quick comments before closing. Tarantino often inserts himself as an actor in his own movies. He's usually not bad, but I was glad to see that he wasn't in this one. It was the better for his staying behind the camera. And leading off the film by quoting the old Klingon proverb, \\"Revenge is a dish best served cold\\" -- that was simply priceless.

B00005JMUA|4.0|Many people seem to prefer \\"Kill Bill\\" Volume 1 over this, the second part. I'm of two minds about this. First, as a fan of character and story over extreme violence, I personally found much more meat to chew on in Volume 2. Second, and more importantly, I think it's kind of silly to separate the two films, as neither one is complete without the other. Tarantino intended them as a single story, and I watched them as a single story, one right after the other. If at all possible, I recommend seeing them both in one sitting to fully appreciate them. It may not be \\"high art\\" or anything, but \\"Kill Bill\\" as a whole is representative of good entertainment and good storytelling.<br /><br />Tarantino weaves quite a story in \\"Kill Bill,\\" adopting his usual technique of starting somewhere in the middle, then jumping the audience forward and back in time to fill in the gaps.

The main theme of the film seemed to be summed up in the observation that the road to revenge leads through a thick forest, and it is often very easy to get distracted from the path.<br /><br />Certainly, Volume 2 moves a bit more slowly then Volume 1 did. The first film is probably most memorable for a lengthy fight scene in which the Bride battles the \\"Crazy 88,\\" a Yakuza organization which, while it doesn't actually have 88 members, definitely has at least 50, and the Bride fights them all at once. Volume 2 has nothing like this. In this second part, there is a great deal of dialogue peppered with quick flashes of violence, but the dialogue is delivered with Tarantino's usual flair for natural speech and the violence is both more shocking and more meaningful as a result. Where the long fight scenes just started to wear thin in Volume 1, Volume 2 kept them fresh while also keeping the story moving briskly.<br /><br />Perhaps the most memorable scene in Volume 2 came near the end of it, when Tarantino genuinely surprised me with a development I really didn't expect. To give it away here would be to ruin some of the fun for a virgin viewer, but suffice it to say that some expectations I had about several of the characters were flipped completely around in the space of a few seconds near the end. A nice touch, that, and one I hadn't seen Tarantino pull off before.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino seems to enjoy making genre movies but twisting the meaning of the genre, and he clearly has enough of an understanding for the genres he works in to manipulate them cleverly.

B000001G5L|5.0|I grew up listening to Beethoven's violin concerto played by Issac Stern.  When I heard the cadenza played by Mutter 10 years later, I thought to myself, it must have been a piece of music about love! Sure enough, as I found out later, Fitz Kriesler dedicated the music to his wife.  It is not a  coincident that these four musicians, Beethoven, Kriesler, Mutter and Karajan had the common vision for the theme of this concerto, often thought of as the least virtuosal in terms of technical difficulties.  Mutter's playing embodies this piece of German classic music in its utmost magnificence: a choral type of passion weaving inside unhurried pace; a seemingly calm and structured canvas of royal blue dabbled with vermillion red. Listen to the cadanza by itself- it knits together fragments of the composer's loving utter and reiterates it as a heart-wrenching sonnet.
0060012218|5.0|I was hooked after the first page of this beautifully written, fast-paced novel. Told through the voice of Russel Middlebrook, the book is effecting and effective. Russel is a gay sophomore at Goodkind High School, and he is facing the inherently scary world of high school, made even scarier by the secret he feels he must keep. When he and other closeted students form the \\"Geography Club,\\" they create a safe and happy haven.  <br /> <br />Though peer pressure and insecurity eventually shape and change the club and the relationships of its members. THE GEOGRAPHY CLUB is essentially a hopeful work. By the time the \\"Geography Club\\" has become the \\"Goodkind High School Gay-Straight-Bisexual Alliance,\\" Russel has gained a better understanding and acceptance of himself, and the reader is optimistic about the protagonist's future. <br /> <br />Hartinger's treatment of his characters is refreshing in its realism. Characters are not stereotypes. Members of the Geography Club are neither unrealistically heroic nor are they self-loathing. Instead, Russel and his friends are average kids with the same wants and needs as their straight peers. Their ideas and actions are funny, flawed, and sometimes heartbreaking. The dialogue is believable, an appropriate mix of slang and profanity. Through his marvelous prose, Hartinger addresses a sensitive subject, and its problems and achievements, with humor and grace. Without a hint of preaching, the author delivers important messages-regardless of their sexuality, teens face the pains and consequences of being different and self-acceptance is essential in growing up. <br /> <br />Parents, teachers, and teens, whether gay and straight, will benefit from this wonderful debut novel.  <br />

B00028HBKM|5.0|If I could give this film all the stars in the sky, I would. Mel Gibson, a man already proven as an excellent director to me with the exceptional Braveheart, gained my respect as a Christian, upon seeing this film. <br /> <br />It is one thing to hear about the events surrounding Christ's persecution and crucifixion, as it is to read about them in the Bible. But that is not enough, at least, not in my opinion. I never once got really emotional just hearing about how He suffered for me....but I did when I saw what it was possibly like. There are no words that can describe the sadness in my heart when I realized that He took all that abuse, all that pain, so that I, so that we, might have a chance to join Him in Paradise one day. It just isn't fair that the Son of God had to go through that for us lowly sinners. <br /> <br />Mel brought out the beauty of the sacrifice God made because He loved us, and this movie is a true testament as to what our faith is all about.
078681859X|4.0|I really thought this was an entertaining book. It was original in some ways and in some ways not so much. Its obvious that Stroud borrowed alot from Rowling. Although Nathaniel, unlike Harry, is a bit off. Ive never known anyone to go to those lenghths to get back at someone for something so stupid, You'd have thought Lovelace had killed a family memeber of his or something. The spirits, or demons, reminded me a bit also of daemons in the Pullman books, but really only because they were bound to their humans. I dont think that daemons would ever try and hurt their human counterparts. But even so it was fun to read. I dont think Ill bother to read it again, its not something you can read more than once but I cant wait to read the next book in the series and see if Bartimaeus finds out more about those kids he and Nathaniel came across on the streets. Im also interested in seeing more of Nathaniel, although most people on here dont like him very much, Id like to see what happens to him as he grows up, but I dont think Stroud will ever go back to him again in the next books.

He tells the group that a murder will occur at midnight with a million dollars going to the first person to identify the culprit.  \\"Murder by Death\\" gently pokes fun at seemingly every mystery movie convention - the eccentric butler, a mansion engulfed in fog and rain, a cut phone wire, and an appropriately convoluted, silly ending.  Because the humor is so good-spirited, even fans of the originals are likely to laugh.  The fast pace also helps keep things on track.  In addition, the acting talent is top-notch, with a who's who of 70s film: Alec Guinness, David Niven, Peter Sellers, Maggie Smith, Peter Falk, and Eileen Brennan.  Recommended for fans of detective films and 70s comedies.
0393035158|1.0|This book appears to have been written by the Anti-Christ.  Anyone with eyes to see will see it.  The author even calls for \\"world government\\" (p. 153).  It is insane that this book ever got published in a Christian Nation like our own.  Even though Harris says some very good things about the danger of Islam (He really does take Mohammed to the mat), his book is a work of evil. Harris' irrational and uninformed \\"opinions\\" only confirms to me that the Word of God is true. In Romans 1:21-22, it says: \\"Because that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.\\" The LORD knew that people like Harris would one day write books exactly like this. This book proves that there IS a God.
B000002LVB|5.0|The Velvet Underground - Loaded (1970)<br /><br />This brilliant album is my least favorite from this remarkable band, but only through default since I love nearly all of their music. Despite the obvious drug reference of the title, it was supposedly meant to mean \\"loaded with hits.\\" In a better, more just world, it would've been a worldwide smash.<br /><br />Lou Reed was nearing the end of his tether and drummer Mo Tucker was on maternity leave which explains the largely conventional drumming found on LOADED by various replacement drummers including Billy Yule, kid brother of bassist Doug Yule who at this point was beginning to suffer delusions of grandeur. Though occasionally melancholy, LOADED sounds bright and positive, which is ironic when you consider that the band's demise was just around the corner.<br /><br />The breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Who Loves the Sun\\" - Very chipper despite its melancholy lyrics from the brokenhearted but sweetly singing Doug Yule. A strong 60's style flair reminiscent of the Beatles and especially the Beach Boys' vocal stylings. Crisp guitar, excellent piano accents. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Sweet Jane\\" - The song begins with a sickly-sweet psychedelic kalaidescope of notes before Velvet mastermind Lou Reed launches into one of the most legendary rock n' roll riffs ever. (Note: avoid old releases containing truncated edits of this song from clueless record company personnel) *****<br /><br />\\"Rock N' Roll\\" - Another belatedly popular classic. The playing and chord changes generate a terrific undercurrent of feel-good excitement. *****<br /><br />\\"Cool It Down\\" - An ambling country-fried tune. The chorus doesn't appear 'til the end of the song, followed by a boogie-woogie-ish piano. Simple, stately and quite effective piano can in fact be heard all over LOADED played by both Reed and Yule. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"New Age\\" - Like its predecessor, This gorgeous song also builds to a climax. It's about the brave new world we all need to create for ourselves from time to time. *****<br /><br />\\"Head Held High\\" - Lou really belts out the vocals on this groovy rocker (parts of which, I'm convinced, were repeatedly ripped off for TV shows in the 70's). ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" - This heavily country-flavored rocker has amusingly hick-ish vocals from Reed. Having grown up in Texas, I have long rebelled against country music even though a few classics of the non-whimpy-male-singer variety (\\"If You Wanna Play in Texas,\\" \\"Devil Went Down to Georgia,\\" etc.) still hold fond memories. So \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" isn't really my tea, but it's undeniably spirited and very well played. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"I Found a Reason\\" - A dreamy slow dance number with more sweet vocal harmonies. I love Lou's slightly hammy monologue in the middle. Yet another song embellished with thoughtful musical flourishes. *****<br /><br />\\"Train Round the Bend\\" - A killer groove machine with a nasty laid-back string attack from ace guitarist Sterling Morrison. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Oh! Sweet Nothin'\\" - A gorgeous, classic album closer. In the same vein as another great album closer, the Stone's \\"Salt of the Earth,\\" this song is a tribute to the less fortunate who walk among us. *****<br /><br />An aside: Around this time, VU recorded a number of versions of a song called \\"Ride Into the Sun.\\" I recently rediscovered a version that I had overlooked from an old Australian box set called WHAT GOES ON. I rarely get it out since I got the PEEL SLOWLY AND SEE  box set and I'm sure it's long out of print (probably for legal reasons). According to the liner notes, the song was taken from a French Polydor 5 CD box set released in June 1990 called simply VELVET UNDERGROUND. Unlike the PEEL SLOWLY AND SEE version featuring Doug Yule on vocals, Lou takes the lead. This version is more ornate with mandolin-style guitar picking. A beauty although the sound quality has deteriorated in places and I slightly prefer the version with Yule singing.rselves from time to time. *****<br /><br />\\"Head Held High\\" - Lou really belts out the vocals on this groovy rocker (parts of which, I'm convinced, were repeatedly ripped off for TV shows in the 70's). ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" - This heavily country-flavored rocker has amusingly hick-ish vocals from Reed.

6305428352|4.0|I just saw Mr. Holland's Opus, via BlockBuster for the FIRST TIME!, ...and I myself a musician (pianist), and raised by a dad who was in fact a \\"Mr. Holland\\" dad, ...the whole nine yards... My dad also a frustrated composer/high school teacher... but Dad finally got published... two of his vocal works, and before his demise his choral works had a primier performance where he was recognized locally, anyway, similarily.This movie is just \\"that\\" short of great.I've read several other reviews, and like them all.  But the point that Glenn Holland was a New York gigging lounge pianist BEFORE the high school gig is always skipped in the bios, and it's an important part of the plot.  _THIS_ high school teacher has just stepped down from an exiting high paced life entertaining in New York City, ...short of making it or being discovered, but nonetheless thick in the middle of the lifestyle.  THIS FACT explains WHY, when he began to make progress with his students he was so capable of using pop styles effectively, to the horror of the priniple.  He was a professional entertainer!  The typical high school music teacher is rarely so capable in this area of music!  I do agree with the negative reviews that mention, \\"One more time glorifying the Beatles,\\" etc. and I do agree.  The Beatles in my mind (as a musician if I may say) are highly overrated.  Decent composers but not great.  Entertainers and stylists that found a market, USA, begging for more, yes, but absolutely not... musicians on the level of Lehner and Lowe, Hammerstein, Cole Porter...   Going back to Bach or Mozart?  Not in a million years.  Same for Elvis, hate to tell you folks.  But nonetheless, The Beatles were more about the hippie movement, the long hair, the beads, the drugs.  The music is rather palid, though some of the melodies a little cute.  Nothing much more. It was more their \\"aura\\", less musical content.  Nothing new.   I found it a little strange for the writers to have Holland  emotionally struck about John Lennon's assasination, it doesn't really fit.   For a one time screaming teenage girl, yes.  For a seasoned, educated, working musician who knows Mozart, Beethoven---to John Coltrane??? A news item, yeah, but not an emotional loss.  Uhh,,, I say unlikely.  I agree, the orchestra sounding like the London Symphony after two practices, (which it probably was), is this Hollywood REALLY condescending to moviegoer, USA or what???  They must really think none of us know anything.  THey are always dumming down. But these observations of mine take about 2% off of a 100% 5 star movie. It's about 4.8.   There is so much good in this movie it's incredible.  The matter of the deaf son--- not an impossibility, and obviously the authors are deliberately bringing to public attention the issues of the deaf.  This part was so engaging, and tearjerking.  The youngest version of Cole, in the scene where he couldn't describe what he wanted out of the cupboard to helpless mom.   If you could watch that without welling up in tears, there's something wrong with you!  Oh that was so touching, and made a wonderful, heartwarming appeal to public awareness of the issues the deaf deal with.  So marvelously presented.   Another great part of this film.  Our hero Holland did NOT take the devil's bait!   FOR ONCE!  HURRAY HOLLYWOOD!  CAN'T BELIEVE IT! He was true to his wife, came home.  Kissed her on the cheek and said goodbye. The girl, certainly only his young teen student to start,  but also certainly, growing into womanhood, and at that point the inuendo was by all means present.  Their teacher student relationship was 100 % wholesome, to the last minute.  She was not a temptress, directly, ..not at all. She was ambitious, another young Billy Holiday.  GOin to New York City.  She dissappears from the plot right there.  Did she make it?? Who knows?    This film is overall, terrific.  Just \\"that\\" short of really really great, but still great.  Yes.  Good for the whole family.THe socialissues of music and arts programs in schools being at/
B00005ABIP|5.0|I love all the cake cd's, but if you are just getting into the band, or even if you are a huge fan who for some reason doesnt have it, Prolonging The Magic is the BEST. Every single song on this album is wondeful, and represents cake at their best. If you buy this cd, it will be one of the best investments you have ever made. I still listen to it every day in my car. Good music to roll down the window to, and just sing along. The people that give this album bad reviews are not real cake fans. They are obviously ignorant and do not like the band. Any real cake fan will tell you that this cd is awesome, and some consider it their favorite. ALL their cd's are good, though. buy them all and enjoy yourself!!!!
B000092ZYX|2.0|This album is made more as a piece of art and for expression than for entertainment. If you are a connoisseur of intellectual/unconventional music, or a liberal democrat, buy this album. Otherwise, I wouldn't advise even paying a penny for it.
B000089J0R|5.0|Dragonforce may be one of the best new metal (and by that I don't mean radio rock) bands out there. This debut, which I listened to samples of in it's entirety on their label's website, is a very original piece of work. The way I see it, they fuse the tempos of extreme thrash (like Slayer) with the combined rhythm section of power metal (like Helloween) and battle metal (like Bal-Sagoth.) Then, fuse in some vocals that sound a bit like Kiske (formerly of Helloween) and you've got Dragonforce.<br /><br />One of the big plusses about this band is not only that their sound is something fresh, but now, we have more than the mighty Manowar to supply us with British power metal. Also, I heard the full length MP3 of \\"Black Winter Night,\\" it was amazing! I definetely am adding this to my wishlist!
B00028HBKM|1.0|I don't want to give this movie even one star. This movie to me is nothing more than blatant pornography in the form of violence instead of sex.  It's Mel Gibson's vision of what happened to Jesus, not the Bible's.  Most Christians need to get out their dusty Bibles and read the truth not go to this movie.  The Bible states not to add anything to it, but Mel did.  Since this movie Mel is no longer one of my favorite actors.  His comments about the movie in reviews also sickened me.  Gibson told the New Yorker he wanted to \\"kill\\" New York Times columnist Frank Rich (and his dog) for writing a critical column. \\"I want to kill him. I want his intestines on a stick.\\"  <br /> <br />In a 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson said women should not become priests. One of his proffered reasons was the fact that a female business partner of his was a \\"c--t.\\"  <br /> <br />Does this sound like someone who is religious and God fearing?  It sounds like someone who's into violence though. <br /> <br />He added: \\"Feminists don't like me, and I don't like them. I don't get their point.\\"  <br /> <br />Gibson has made similar crude remarks about gays.  <br /> <br />In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gibson said Catholics will get to heaven much faster than those of other denominations and faiths. <br /> <br />Thanks, but no thanks, I'll pass on anymore Mel movies. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000268QB2|5.0|Beautiful, haunting, luminous instrumentation. A voice that is not only passionate but powerful and pure. I was beginning to wonder if being able to sing was actually a disability in the current music scene, then along comes Keane. This is a completely modern sound, although with echoes of the late Freddy Mercury of Queen in the vocals, and production and structure reminiscent of the sundays-- another too-overlooked British band with an incredibly gifted vocalist.  This is a lush musical treat that avoids the maudlin pouting or angst-filled suicide poses so popular in music right now. Hopes and Fears is a complete aural experience. <br />
B00006FDCD|5.0|IT was an incredible, blood-chilling book and the movie only made more real,more vivid , more.....evil. IT is really one of the better SK Movies. With a humorous yet evil clown and mature,youg teens its sure to be a great first part. In the second part the big showdown begins. Even when the former young teens(who are now aldutls now) come together to meet back in there home town,It is already showing signs that he's back and more evil than ever. To find out what happens you should see the movie or read the book.
B0000CFW87|1.0|I bought \\"Closer\\" by Josh Groban hoping to hear the songs that are listed on the CD. I don't know what the problem is, but all this CD will do is allow me to join his fan club. If you don't want to experience world class frustration you best buy and test this album at your local store.
B000000OQF|5.0|There are bands way better than GNR, like Jimi Hendrix, the Who, and especially Led Zeppelin (they will always be the best). However, this is the best album ever because an amazing 11/12 songs are good. This album is not overrated, it is just their only good album. <br /> <br />The songs: <br />Welcome to the Jungle: 8/10 <br />A good song that sets the tone to the rest of the album, but it is very overrated. Maybe this song is why critics say Appetite is overrated. <br /> <br />It's So Easy: 9/10 <br />Here things get better. This song has a nice crunchy sound and a good outro. <br /> <br />Nightrain: 8/10 <br />The opening riff is too catchy for me, but the rest of the song is a good, fast rocker. <br /> <br />Out ta Get Me: 10/10 <br />The formula of the last two songs, straight on hard-rock, is applied here to full effect. The bridge of this song is the highlight be far. \\"They won't touch me!\\" <br /> <br />Mr. Brownstone: 10/10 <br />G N' R switches gears here and tries a song about heroin addiction with a \\"Walk this Way\\" style riff. It's very experimental sounding but very good. Listen to Axl and Izzy \\"voice-mixing\\" in the chorus and you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br />Paradise City: 10/10 <br />Slash starts this song off with a great intro, and it only gets better. The riffs are great, the chorus kicks, this song rocks. <br /> <br />My Michelle: 8/10 <br />This is a very dark song, so again GNR sounds experimental, and it works again. <br /> <br />Think About You: 8/10 <br />This is a very underrated song. This could just as easily be a Van Halen song. <br /> <br />Sweet Child O' Mine: 9.5/10 <br />I somehow don't like the intro riff to this, it sounds like Slash is getting intimate with his guitar. However, this is a very good ballad, kicking their later ballads. <br /> <br />You're Crazy: 9/10 <br />This song sounds like it is supposed to be played slower, and it is on GNR lies. Strangely enough, this version sounds good. <br /> <br />Anything Goes: 5.5/10<br />This song really sucks. The intro sucks, the lyrics suck, the riffs are OK, skip this song. <br /> <br />Rocket Queen Pt. 1: 9/10 <br />This song is essentialy 2 songs, and the first part is great, especially the chorus. <br /> <br />Rocket Queen Pt. 2: 8/10 <br />The transition to this slower part is good, but it makes the song a little long. They really only needed one verse in addition to the solo in this part. <br /> <br />The musicians: <br />Axl: An Ok-Good singer, so stop making fun of him. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Slash: Only Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page are better. 5/5 <br /> <br />Izzy: When he sings with Axl, the effect is pretty cool, and he's an OK guitarist. 3/5 <br /> <br />Duff: A average bass player, but he gets no solos and is mixed far back. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />Adler: What a good drummer, not one of the best but very good 4/5 <br />
0393035158|5.0|I haven't finished this book yet (I'm about half way through).  But it is really delivering the goods.  THE END OF FAITH is a seriously disturbing and enlightening look at the dangers of unjustified belief.
B00000JCOV|5.0|A very brutal CD from a very brutal band. I had the honor of seeing them at Ozzfest this summer and they kicked up about 5 different mosh/circle pits without even trying. I even got to meet Corey, Sid, and Craig and get Vol. 3 signed. So, back to the CD. Excellent, people hate it because Slipknot wear masks and have nine members (Actually, I feel people hate them because they don't like the fans, and want to make sure everyone knows they are not associated with that crowd). That's great for them but they are missing an awesome album. Even Kerry King digs these guys, come on, they can't be that bad. I think there are a lot of horrid bands out there that should be ragged on (Type O Negative, anyone?), Slipknot is just an easy target because they are so popular now. My favorite songs are (sic), Eyeless, Wait and Bleed, Tattered and Torn, Me Inside, Liberate, Prosthetics, No Life and Scissors (basically the whole CD). So if you can look past the masks and coveralls, think for yourself, and not worry about what your peers/fellow metalheads will think of you, buy it.
B0002A2WDQ|1.0|Crossroads is a great movie, but the long awaited DVD release leave a lot to be desired. As a DVD release, this movie only gets one star.   <br />  This movie inspired many, many people to pick up at learn guitar, including myself. Sony ignores the influence this movie had on guitar players.  <br />  For Sony not to include a single bonus extra, interview, or even backstory on the ledgend of Robert Johnson it a complete and utter shame.   <br />  It's awfully high priced not to include anything extra. <br />  It does have Japanese subtitles though. Big frigging deal!
B000021XS0|5.0|This album is one of the greatest albums ever made, nevertheless it is also very clever. sort of a rock opera type element to it. And i dont care if the lyrics are a little cheesy, i only care about the music, and the musicians really shine here. <br /> <br />\\"Regression\\" - 10/10 - The only reason i gave it a ten is because it leads into \\"overture 1928\\" and \\"strange de ja vu\\", it is a short little intro to the rest of the album. <br /> <br />\\"overture 1928\\"- 10/10 - i'd give it an 11 but thats not allowed, this song is truly a classic and every DT fan should know this one. I give it an A++. <br /> <br />\\"Strange De Ja Vu\\" - 10/10 - Very good song with labries vocals shining mostly, but the instruments back him up very well. <br /> <br />\\"Through my words\\" - 10/10 - Once again this is a 1 minute intro to one of the best songs on the album, thats why it deserves a 10. <br /> <br />\\"Fatal Tragedy\\" - 10/10 - My favorite song on the album, all of the music comes together perfectly from a soft piano intro to a double feel fast encore to end it all. Very good song. <br /> <br />\\"Through Her Eyes\\" 8/10 - Not the greatest but still ok nonetheless. <br /> <br />\\"Home\\" - 10/10 - Ah, Here we go, an extremely good song with the E string tuned to B! Thats pretty strange but the whole song is genius, once again building up from a  soft beginning to a fast feel riff. Excellent song. <br /> <br />\\"The Dance of Eternity\\" - 10/10 - Ok, heres the deal, some people dont like it because they think its too long, BUT the musicianship in the song is definitely at DT's best, the best music on the album. So much harmony and all that goodness. You'll love it if you play an instrument. <br /> <br />\\"One Last Time\\" - 10/10 - Just a good solid song. <br /> <br />\\"The Spirit Carries On\\" - 10/10 - Durn good song, alot of variety. Ends with a gospel choir. <br /> <br />\\"Finally Free\\" - 10/10 - awesome ending pulls the whole entire album together. <br /> <br />DT really out did themselves this time,Amazing album, go buy it when you get the chance.
B00006879E|5.0|Okay, so Maroon 5 is somewhat overplayed. But if people didn't like SONGS ABOUT JANE, then WHY is it such a big seller? Someone out there is obviously digging it. So blame it on the BUYERS and the program directors on radio, NOT THE BAND!<br /><br />I personally love this CD. I brought it on the recommendation of some friends who told me that if I was a fan of Stevie Wonder's '70s work, then I would really enjoy it. At the time I had only heard \\"This Love\\", which to me seemed a cross between old Motown and rock and roll, and I liked it immediately. But I hadn't gotten the CD. Finally, I decided to buy it, just to take a chance on it. Turns out that once I put it in my CD player, it has become a permanent fixture! This is a so-called rock/pop CD but then again it branches off into R&B, funk and even a little contemporary jazz, so it really has no genre. And that may be the best thing about it because it's just GOOD MUSIC, period! It may have a bit of a \\"boy band\\" feel to it, due to the harmonies of these guys and the catchy hooks in their lyrics, but they are NOT a boy band, at least not in terms of what a \\"boy band\\" is referred to these days...to dismiss them as such would be a mistake. They play instruments, they don't dance, and they are NOT just a bunch of singers thrown together!<br /><br />Adam Levine, Maroon 5's lead singer, is obviously a huge Stevie Wonder fan. He isn't trying to be Stevie, but he gives it a good try anyway. Maybe it's just me, but not only do I hear Stevie's influence throughout this CD, but I'm also picking up Sting (\\"She Will Be Loved\\", \\"Must Get Out\\"), Steve Miller (\\"The Sun\\"), a little Michael Jackson (\\"Not Coming Home\\"), even a little Lauryn Hill (\\"The Sweetest Goodbye\\"), if you can believe that...I guess we all hear something different. But for the most part, it is the Wonder Man who seems to be the one who these guys idolize the most. Songs about love, contempt, obsession, passion, separation...it pretty much runs the gamut here on SONGS ABOUT JANE and my only complaint is that some of the songs are not long enough! Those of you complaining about how the lyrics concentrate too much on sex - HELLO! Don't know if you have noticed it, but that is what 90% of most contemporary music is about, so don't single Maroon 5 out. You might as well blast every act in the business, if that's the case.<br /><br />Stop hating on this band and enjoy the music for what it is: catchy, enjoyable pop with a funky R&B twist. If you don't care for that type of music then just don't buy the CD, period. But if you do, then you'll love it. It's not the first time blending those genres has been done and it certainly won't be the last, but this is at least one of the better efforts. Worth having in your collection.and my only complaint is that some of the songs are not long enough! Those of you complaining about how the lyrics concentrate too much on sex - HELLO!

B00006690G|4.0|eminem can really spit and he shows it on this album.  Favorite songs are till i collapse, white america, and square dance.  WORTH THE BUY!!!
6305364613|1.0|This movie is more like a mockumentary to classic literature. I was turned off by all the present modern effects. The actors were brave to even try this film.
B00029LNHS|1.0|The Black Eyed Peas can't rhyme and thats plain to see.  They spit out rhymes like, \\"Let's get retarded\\"  how stupid is that.  They need to learn how to rap and then come out with a real rap album.  I would call this a pop album gone wrong.
B00004SPYJ|5.0|The timless writings of Shakespeare are brought to life in this film. I had watched it in jr. high in the mid eighties. The passion Romeo brought forth to speak of his love for her.  The anticipated moment Juliet senses the security and comfort in his thoughts and dreams. This masterpiece would turn me on to other works such as \\"A midsummer nights dream,\\" and, a more modern writers work. An American author, Richard Bach, writes The Bridge across forever.\\"  Bach's story probably could not be made into a play, yet the completeness two souls can make together in a beautiful life of shared hope and ideals just remind me of the good parts of this film.
B0001AP12G|4.0|when i first listened to this album i did not really enjoy it, and i did not even listen to the whole cd.  when i went back later and finished it i saw that there was an explosive ending.  the last 3-4 songs really put this CD together with the tracks, \\" 2words\\", \\"through the wire\\", \\"Family Business\\", and \\"Last Call\\".  Overall this album is definetely worth buying but there were still too many talking skits in the beginning of the CD.
6302814790|5.0|I used to want to recommend this to anyone a while ago, and I still do! Beetlejuice is the kind of film that I sometimes like to watch more than once in a row. It used to be my favorite movie and I still very much enjoy it!! This IS the kind of movie where you have to watch out who sees it, but I do not think it's scary at all and  it is a classic.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|This cd has some really good songs including, track 1 Git Up and track 8 How Come which D12 made a double music video of recently.  Don't get fooled by the poppy song, \\"My Band\\" cause they were just kidding around with that one. the rest is good real rap and hip hop.

B00028HBKM|4.0|Besides the religious backdrop, the main crux of this movie is to depict as much realism and authenticity as possible about the corporeal punishment during the Roman times. From the religious view point, the movie wants you to feel visually what your Lord has gone through. <br /> <br />If you think that the 39 lashes were just mere whips, you are quite misinformed. Read Josh McDowell's book on Crucifixion and  you will get the written version about the instruments used during Jesus' time. Again, the crucifixion itself was shown under full light with no turning away of the camera. <br /> <br />In my opinion, the movie has achieved, in stellar proportions, what it had set out to do. The additional depiction of Mary's love for her Son was well constructed, although not documented the way the movie has shown. All in all, the theatrical effects are moving and they are a good reminders for believers. <br /> <br />Good work, Mel! <br /> <br />
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|The killer is neat. I never used to a be a very big fan when this came out {everyone else was}, but know I figured this is a good horror movie spoof. On the special features, you will find the \\"making of Scary Movie\\" and it says how hard it was to write this film. I JUST HAVE SO MUCH FUN WATCHING THE KILLER DO HIS STUFF. At the end, they finally find out who the killer was, and it could be a little surprising!
B00005JN2F|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy is a great Action movie. The car crashes and chase scenes are astounding.The cinematography done during the car crashes is just completely amazing and thrilling. If you<br /><br />want to see great action in a movie, this is the movie to see.<br /><br />Matt Damon is a great action-adventure star. Joan Allen is perfect as the head of the agency out to stop Bourne. Julia Stiles shows what a great actress she is, she is completely believable in a a great role.<br /><br />A fun and adventurous movie that will have you on the edge of your seat.
B00005Q66T|2.0|I'll start my review by saying my love affair with MADONNA started in 1983 when the 12' of EVERBODY was released and was only played on the so called \\"black stations\\" in NYC(WBLS,the original KTU,and KISS). Subsequently I have most everything she's ever released. As everyone knows change and innovation has always been her true religon. Her first collection of hits back in 90' had cleverly remixed versions of her eighties tracks done with great care by SHEP PETTIBONE and i'm sure supervised shrewdly by MADONNA'S talented micro managing eye. That collection also included two new tracks and simultaneaously released a box version of the collection with a an accompanying video collection. That was a treat! MADONNA at the time was a full sensory experience. Back in the day she even released some her music with scents picked by her(Material Girl 12' and the LIKE A PRAYER album). I was caught by surprise when GHV2 was released because I thought,has it been 10 years of hits already? Yes it has. Unfortunately this collection harkened a new era of MADONNA. Corporate MADONNA. This collection only features radio edits of her singles and no new tracks and absolutely no regard for continuity. This is a choppy jukebox collection for the BRITNEY and JUSTIN set. She also leaves out many tracks that were worthy to be on here. As for the limited edition hard cover version of this cd it only provides you with teeny tiny pictures of her superficial \\"evolution\\". This is an okay collection for her casual listeners but for us hardcore fans quite frankly it's a rip off .<br />One of my friends shocked by the randomness of this release asked me \\"does she even know this has been released?\\" I still don't know. She needs to release a collection of her best 90's remixes seamlessly sequenced by VICTOR CALDERONE or PETER RAUHOFER.
B000001E8S|4.0|In the mid 1990s, U2 took time out of A) saving the world and B) revamping their image by creating \\"Original Soundtracks 1\\" with longtime producer Brian Eno. This is NOT a U2 album and should not be considered a starting point for anyone new to the U2 library. That said, the Passengers sideline project was an interesting diversion from the ZooTV tour, and is an interesting extension of what the band had accomplished with \\"Achtung, Baby\\" and \\"Zooropa.\\" <br /> <br />Here is an album that's almost like electronic jazz, perfect for a quiet Friday night with a glass of wine and no lights on. The tracks were fashioned around scenes for movies that do not exist, truly one of the more original album concepts of the last ten years. <br /> <br />You can hear Edge's guitar throughout \\"OS1,\\" as well as Bono's voice, Larry's drums and Adam's guitar. But these elements are in the service of something distinctly different, the sounds of a futuristic city coming to life in a gently erotic sort of way. If that sounds esoteric and a little weird, well, that's \\"OS1.\\" <br /> <br />The best track is without a doubt \\"Always Forever Now,\\" which builds incessantly around a throbbing bassline, propelled forward into the night by Larry's amazing drumwork. This is a beautiful song, the lyrics consisting only of Bono's spoken word mantra. <br /> <br />\\"Miss Sarajevo\\" is also on the album, but it's eclipsed by the sci-fi erotica of \\"Your Blue Room,\\" the strangely aquatic \\"Slug,\\" Bono's piano figure on \\"Beach Sequence,\\" Edge's ghostly vocals on \\"Corpse,\\" and Eno's bizzare electronic vocals on \\"A Different Kind of Blue.\\" The strangest song, without doubt, is \\"Elvis Ate America,\\" a rap spoken by Bono that picks up where \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" left off on The Unforgettable Song (and surpasses it). <br /> <br />\\"OS1\\" isn't for everyone. It took me about 10 years to get used to it, because even though the gang from U2 are front and center, this ain't U2 music. Still, if you're willing to let goof your expectations and accept this as cinematic mood music, you'll have a good time. A very good time.
B00004X01U|3.0|I was still reeling from the epic RAY OF LIGHT when this one came out. When I heard<br />MUSIC I flipped for the single,it was vintage dancefloor \\"EVERYBODY\\" MADONNA. i suspected that this album was going to have retreads into familiar grooves from her. Yes and no. This album comes across specifically designed for the current ADD  MTV generation. It's not bad but it's very choppy,she fails to make one sound out of many actually it's very akin to True Blue in that sense. There are three clunkers here. At number one NOBODY'S PERFECT, this trite simplistic excercise in vocoder torture will have your head exploding like the martians in MARS ATTACKS. The constipated RUNAWAY LOVER sounds like a bside remix from EROTICA. PARADISE(not for me) drones on and on and were treated to some lame pretentious French lyrics when she runs out of ideas in English. The rest of the tracks stand well on their own,she should of re-edited the track list and re-named the album SINGLES.
B00009WNWC|2.0|A classic? I don't think that I have ever seen such an artificial and boring love story in my entire life. <BR> I didn't cry. I moaned and groaned, and waited to get these two people that I didn't care about off my T.V. screen. I just did not like any of the characters. The actors were like lifeless cardboard cut-outs, reading their lines. <BR>It's an old classic to some, but definitely not for everybody.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I'm a little late in my review but I have to say  this is one of the most underrated albums in recent memory. I've read some reviews where some people and critics have accused this album of being self indulgent.Hello! It's a Madonna album,she has been around for twenty years get a clue. I'll admit my first listen of the AMERICAN LIFE single I coudn't believe no one stopped her from releasing this as the first single in all honesty HOLLYWOOD,LOVE PROFUSION or even NOTHING FAILS,would of been much more effective as the first single. This album is true to MADONNA'S rebellious quasi political nature. Those who don't agree don't know MADONNA the artist. With the exception of DIE ANOTHER DAY this album is as poignant and honest as MADONNA gets. This is not for the INTO THE GROOVE crowd its more for the RAY OF LIGHT crowd. There are no feel good ditties but songs of personal reflections,possible regrets and political discord and redemption. As world events spin out of control this album ages nicely and becomes more relevant and less indulgent. I also recommend the accompanying singles for LOVE PROFUSION,NOTHING FAILS and HOLLYWOOD. With this album I implore you to OPEN YOUR HEART,it's okay no one  is looking.
B00024BHTC|5.0|I just recently saw Nightwish in Los Angeles and it was the most amazing thing I've ever experienced. Their tour just happened to be based on the 'Once' album.  <br /> <br />1. Dark Chest of Wonders- Very fast and deep, excellent vocals and ochestral work. Great opener. 8/10 <br /> <br />2. Wish I had an Angel- Great vocals, also deep. Good song. 7/10 <br /> <br />3. Nemo- Here it is, the best song of the album. Even more amazing live, No flaws here. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Planet Hell- Chilling vocals, absolutely wonderful. Again even more amazing live. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Creek Mary's Blood- Slow at first, but picks up after 2nd 1/2. Great guitar and vocal work. 8/10 <br /> <br />6. The Siren- Not much guitar work here, lots n lots of vocals. 6/10 <br /> <br />7. Dead Gardens- Mmmm guitar work but very repetetive. 6/10 <br /> <br />8. Romanticide- After a couple of bummers, this will hit you hard. Fast guitars and lovely vocals by Tarja. 8/10 <br /> <br />9. Ghost Love Score- Slow.. but incredible! Orchestral work is unbelievable and vocals are very soothing. 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan- Great vocals, but could of done without. 6/10 <br /> <br />11. Higher than Hope- Not fast, but still sounds great. Starts out slow, but becomes a little more alive. Can't beat Tarja's voice.. sorry just can't. 8/10 <br /> <br />Two words, 'buy this' because I promise you wont be dissapointed. Listen to one or two of their previous albums just to get used to them, they're all wonderful. I do also suggest trying to see them live, you'll never experience anything like it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I truely admire this Led Zeppelin DVD released not too long ago. I bought it the day it came out at Fye Music for 25$ being too excited to wait for the price to go down. The first concert at The Royal Albert Hall is very good for being it was recorded in 1969. The sound quality is some-what of an astonishment as well as the sound quality. You will hear many early Zeppelin recordings on DVD one including Communication Breakdown, and I Cant Quit You Baby. Also John Bonham plays his 20 minute plus Moby Dick with several camera angles capturing everything from, every perspective. The second disc is the better disc for most of the Led Zeppelin fans including many performences. The Madison Square Garden Performence is really great better than the other Madison Square Garden Peformence (the song remains the same). I love when they do Black Dog, and The Ocean very cool. I also like the Earls Court performences both acoustic, and electric. For the acoustic set i really enjoyed Going To California. I also liked the Stairway To Heaven performence at Earls Court. My very favorite performence at of all of the concerts was Knebworth 79. Knebworth over the years has been bootleged many times in poor quality, both sound, and audio. But when they included this Knebworth performence this just blew the bootlegs out of the water. I love when they do Nobody's Fault But Mine, also Rock N Roll. In this double DVD set their is also a booklet for both DISCS that explain every concert with some cool pictures. I highly recomend this one to any body I dont care if you love led zeppelin like I do, or hate them this one is for you! Enjoy!
B000051VQR|5.0|This album doesnt need deep criticism , its simply FUN!!!! FUN!!!! FUN!!!! , I love it!!!!
B0000DG00B|5.0|The Allman Brother's Live at Atlanta Pop Festival is one of the best live recordings compared to live at the Fillmore East. But of course the Fillmore East is much better. The jams are endless with the Allman Brothers expescially on the Mountian Jam with johnny winter on the third guitar. I really think the sound quality is clean, for a festival. Like I said before endless\\" jams are on this one. Duane Allman really screams his slides while Dickey Betts plays both lead, and rythem. I believe the allman brothers played Atlanta Pop before their Fillmore Concert. Just three months after the fillmore concert was released, Duane Allman died in a motorcycle accident. I think for most this is an acceptionally good album worth a listen.
0446677450|5.0|I guess I can understand why some people attack this book. When you have been programmed all of your life to think a certain way, it is hard to change, even when what you are doing is not working.     It seems like it is almost sacriligious to go against what are teachers, parents and other early mentors taught us. Question: How many of those parents, teachers, relatives and friends were or are rich?     When I picked up Rich Dad Poor Dad for the first time, I too was disheartened by the content of the information. This went against everything I had ever been told. I was told that a home is an asset. I was told to get a great education and to work really hard at my job. I was told that a job is right up there with family and God. Then I looked around at the people who gave me that advice. Respectfully, some of my older relatives, and mentors had limited success. People in this generation were not doing very well with those old style ideas.    I am now using Kiyiosaki's ideas. Just as he learned from his Rich Dad, I am learning from my Rich Dad---Robert Kiyosaki. Unlike others, I was at least willing to try this new concept. Hey, what I was doing wasn't working. I quickly tired of the long commute and seeing my first five months of earnings go to taxes while the rest went for my \\"assets\\" like my home.     One of the first things I did was start a home based business part time in my spare time. I was thrilled to find that I could write off a portion of my house, my phone and utilities, my car and related expences, my computer and more.    This past summer I went on several vacations. Not only did I pay for them courtesy of my small home based business, but I was able to write off the expences of traveling saving me a bundle in taxes.    I took out a home equity line of credit and started investing in 3/2 bread and butter real estate rental properties, tax liens and discounted mortgages. Now my home is an asset because it is generating income for me.    Investments hadbeen seeing red since the Clinton Bear Market in 2000 and by following the tips as advocated by Kiyosaki, I was able to revamp my portfolio and most importantly, taken control myself rather than leave this up to brokers. Now I know how too use calls and puts to hedge my investments as well as how to pick the best investments. As Kiyosaki says, \\"Every economy has a best investment. What was a great investment last year may be (and usually is) a poor investment now. And too many people have too much money in the stock market without understanding what or why they are investing in.\\"     Thanks to Kiyosaki, I repeat, I am in control. Not my broker, financial advisor or planner although I do consult with professionals. And I am making money with my portfolio. I now realize that \\"buy and hold\\" is a strategy that has come and gone as is dollar cost averaging.    I highly recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad and anything else from Kiyosaki that you can get your hands on. All these years on the best seller lists says something about Robert Kiyosaki and if you think it's just marketing, then you are a fool.    Finally, disregard the 1 star reviews. They all come from the same person with an agenda.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble before Texas Flood played live shows in small bars, and clubs...... but the music was the only thing that really mattered to me. I think young Stevie Ray Vaughan was truely amazing being a young guitarist while he recorded Texas Flood. The best blues song on this album is Texas Flood. I also loved Pride And Joy, Rude Mood, and Mary Had A Little Lamb. Their is five bonus tracks included on this CD including SRV speaks, Tin Pan Alley, Testify, Mary Had A Little Lamb, and Wham. I think for any Texas-Blues fan Texas Flood is gold! Enjoy!
B0002858YS|3.0|I dont exactly know where to start with this. I got hooked on the band when I heard \\"somebody told me\\" on my music tv station. i then heard \\"jenny..\\" and \\"mr.brightside\\" and thought, 'wow, this band kicks..' so i went out and bought the cd. when i got home and listened to the cd, i wasn't blown away.  <br />i was expecting more of an..edge to the music, and i didn't get it. what i got was slow paced almost boring music. of the 11 songs, i can think of 4 off the top of my head that i would choose to listen to. <br />dont get me wrong, they've got talent and whatnot, but this cd is going to have to grow on me.
0393035158|5.0|Someone who finally says it.  Religion is leading us to the brink.  This book is courageoous, brilliant, funny (yes, funny).  Boy, can this guy write.  i couldn't put it down.
B000002H33|5.0|Oh man this is,I think, the best metallica album ever i mean the songs are just phanomanol. Metallica is one of the best rock bands ever. Just to hear their music is a blessing by its self. You cant go wrong with Metallica. By the way Greg Dilhole or what ever his name is has horrible taste in music. If you dont belive me just look at what he gives other great bands.
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is great. I hear a lot of people bashing on the killers because of them \\"ripping off good 80's bands.\\" Let me tell you, the killers are a band that mixes everything together: 80's synth, 70's rock, and a bunch of other styles. There is not one bad song on this CD, no fillers. Not to mention the lyrics are great, sometimes crazy and weird, but nonetheless awesome. Check out the Singles Mr. Brightside and Somebody Told Me...You'll be hooked from the first listen.
1576751988|5.0|This book is so simple and powerful. Take the effort to buy this one and it will change the way you do things forever. <br /> <br />I used to spend all my time trying to be all things to all people and never accomplish anything quickly. Now I focus my time on what matters most and accomplish so much more.
B00005JNEI|5.0|This is Michael Moore's best work yet. He based his information on all the facts that were already out there; then put it in a nice, neat little package. The best part of all is that it will be released a month before the elections! Great planning by the studios. I saw this film in the theater with my two teen-agers, who are also very politically aware. They enjoyed it just as much as I did. Great job, Michael!!!!
B00003CXCT|3.0|It has come to my attention through a retail employee who has seen this DVD set, that additional revisions have been made to the special edition versions from 1997!!  I will tell you what has been confirmed: In A New Hope, Jabba has been redone entirely to resemble Return of the Jedi's Jabba.  In The Empire Strikes Back, Ian Mcdiarmid who plays Palpatine has done some material for the hologram sequence. Finally for Return of the Jedi, the planet Naboo has been added to the end celebration sequence.  For those of you who are praying that Hayden Christensen will not appear THINK AGAIN!  It is confirmed, Sebastian Shaw who played the original Anakin ghost at the end of the film has been replaced by Hayden.  No joke!!! Enjoy!!
B0001ADAVK|1.0|When I saw the previews for this film I was very excited. Dead Poets Society has always been my favourite film and this film looked like it was based on that to quite a great extent, so I was dying to see it based in a girls school- especially with Julia Roberts in the leading role- I loved her other films. But I saw this film and I absolutely hated every minute of it. Firstly, the girls in the school are teenagers, youngsters and yet they are given this irritating \\"wisdom\\" and are weighed down with issues, whereas in the Dead Poets all of the boys are lovely and sweet and just had a \\"young\\" feel about them, but these girls are unconvincing as human beings! I make an exception for one girl, Connie, who is insecure and innocent and makes delightful viewing- but shes a minor character. Secondly, Julia Roberts' character as the art teacher is dissappointing. She is not inspiring and passionate- she is riddled with her own issues and problems, and unlike Robin Williams in Dead Poets, she is not lovable or a figure of help and strength for her students. Her affair with another professor was ridiculous- he is clearly a horrible person, so this made you dislike Julia even more for falling for him. Finally, this film isnt moving or feel-good, it is stupid, implausible and didn't acheive anything. The plot is too simple- everything is spelt out to you in black and white and the stryline is just completely unbelievable. If you loved Dead Poets Society, don't buy this. If you haven't seen it- DONT BUY THIS!

B00005QXDD|5.0|I am your typical girl's girl, but when I discovered this album I loved every single track and listened to it in the car constantly- for the good music and for the comedy. I love Jack Black's voice because he can say anything in the world and make it sound cool, and I love the character of Kyle who is random itself but above all I love the songs- especially Explosivo and Lee. I would never recommend this to my friends or family- they would hate it and think I was crazy because they're all into Joanie Richards and Celine Dion. It has definately fed my inner bloke, because it is very crude and a bit graphic, and I would say that it is a very masculine CD, but any broadminded rock fan who wants something different would love this as much as I do.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This is an amazing movie, in all aspects... history, photography, music...  <br />As someone said here in the reviews, this is not for everybody (and I'm sure you're not everybody), you have to open your soul to see it and love it... I felt very much in friendship with humankind again when I saw it... I also lived a similar experience in the same country, so it made me live it a little again...  <br />Forget about the reviews, watch this movie and decide by yourself... it's not a common love history but it's the most beautiful that I have ever seen, I hope it reaches your heart the same way it reached mine...
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Blade was interesting, but to me it failed emotionally. You just do not connect with the film on the personal level. The effects were super, but that was the main impact...\\"wow what amazing effects\\". You feel like breaking out in a chorus of Peggy Lee's Is That All There Is. Special effects alone cannot make a movie great.<br /><br />Underworld makes that jump, great FX work, but also gives you characters you really care about, ones that you really love to hate. A strong plot line designed to hook you and keep you, just does that. With the emotional involvement, there is a greater impact, a movie that will demand repeat viewing. Instant Cult Status.<br /><br />The movie grabs you from the opening and never lets up with the pace. Firm direction and with a driving score, the movie reaches for perfection. You have a 1000-year-old war between Lycons and Vampires, and it's all coming to a head. It's a well thought out and executed premise and Kate Beckinsale shines! She is an amazing talent. I first adored her work in Cold Comfort Farm as Robert Post's child Flora. When you compare that gentle, deft bit of humour with this kick a*** vampire hunter, it proves what an overlooked talent she is. With Van Helsing out now (and I am sure this movie led to her landing the role), she is finally getting a spotlight she so well deserves.<br /><br />A gloomy, atmospheric ambiance to the whole movie is maintained all the way through, adding a strong foundation for the otherworld premise. I am sure some will nitpick things, as all vampire film faces, but kudos for the vibrant energy and sheer edgy feel to the film.<br /><br />It leaves you hanging, clearly open for a sequel...one can but hope it maintains this high quality.<br /><br />Kate rocks...you don't need to know anymore! It has about 13 minutes of footage not in the original.  A great battle scene and some backstory on Michael.  Rounds out the film nicely without dragging it down.  A great pounding soundtrack, too!<br />
B00028HBKM|2.0|After all the hype surrounding this film, I was a bit surprised to find that the violence pictured was less than expected.  I was sure \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" would employ sequences showing blood and body parts flying in all directions - and in slow-motion.  I saw worse violence in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and in those \\"Alien\\" movies.  It's obvious that most Christians find this movie rather graphic, and incredibly moving, because this violence is being done to Jesus.  True, no other film has shown Jesus's execution with this much attention to \\"detail\\".  But I was far more moved by Franco Zeffirelli's \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\", which shows why many Jews and the High Priest hated Jesus so, making the execution sequence incredibly powerful.   <br /> <br />The movie is inaccurate as to history and the Bible, and is Mel's own vision as to the events.  I do give high marks for the acting, the music, and the camera work.  In fact, the look of the entire film is most beautiful (too bad the subject matter couldn't have been more beautiful). <br /> <br />Mel is, without question, aiming his magnum opus at the Christian public, who have been taught the story from birth.  If Mel had presented more of the tale leading up to the trial, I would have been happier.  Otherwise, all I see is a movie about a man being tortured and executed. <br /> <br />I agree with film critic Richard Roeper, that this film doesn't stand the \\"repeated viewing\\" test.  If watching a man being crucified is your thing, try renting it first.
B00005B36H|5.0|If you were ever wishing Tool would extend some songs so you could enjoy them at home, just like a concert, look no further.  At 78:50 minutes you'll certainly have time to use your lighter for something other than a desired encore :)  Songs are mostly on the cerebral side with a few blood pumpers thrown in to keep the edge.  Nice work guys! Now get back to work and make another!
B00006RU5B|4.0|I should say that I approached this album as a longtime fan of Soundgarden and Chris Cornell, and while I do enjoy a few of Rage Against the Machine's songs, on the whole I was not a big fan of Zach de la Roca or his in-your-face politics.  I can see why fans of Rage would be disappointed with Audioslave, though, because this new band tends to err on the side of Soundgarden's sound whenever they have to make a choice between the style of their two predecessors.  You won't hear any rapping and only the most oblique political commentary on this album, which is apparently the direction Cornell wanted to go.  The result of Audioslave's efforts is a disc that manages to deliver on most of the band's initial promise.  It starts off strongly with Cochise, Show Me How to Live, and Like a Stone, wanders a little past the midway point with two or three filler tracks, and then finally picks up again at the end with a couple of slower-paced but very well done songs, Getaway Car and The Last Remaining Light.  For their first effort, it's very well done, and I would recommend it to anyone tired of the insipid fratboy music that currently passes for modern rock.  There's a misfire or two, but this is to be expected for a debut album from a band that's had pull together so many disparate influences into one whole package.  I'd be on the lookout for their next effort.

0783232039|4.0|Bride of Chucky is by far the best out of the Chucky series. But you should know that this is not really a Horror movie like the previous ones were. This is actually more like a Comedy. When Chucky and his new bride Tiffany are killing people it kind of pokes fun of the Horror genre. The dialogue is what makes this movie so great.Even though the dialogue in this movie by Chucky is very crude,it will still have you laughing.Every little thing that Chucky says or does is very funny in this film. The acting in the movie is not all that great but its a Horror movie so usually there are no name actors in the movie. The only real good actor in the movie is the great John Ridder who died tragically last year. Even though the acting ain't that good it doesn't mean that you still can't have fun watching this movies. If your a fan of the Chucky series you will be very entertained as you watch Chucky and his bride in this go on an adventure to recapture a amulet that will turn them back into humans. The only movie that could possibly be better than this is Seed of Chucky when it hits theaters November of 2004
B00005JJX8|4.0|To Catch a Thief, though widely regarded as one of Alfred Hitchcock's minor works, benefits from extensive location shooting in the south of France, and of course, the luminous quality of its two leads.  It's a worthwhile romantic thriller with plenty of light moments, and certainly one of the most colorful films of his career.<br /><br />But the real attraction to die-hard Hitchcock fans is a brief but fascinating featurette, narrated by the director's daughter and granddaughter, which (much like the movie itself) shows a lighter side of Hitchcock.  Home movies of Hitch playing with his kids, horsing around on sets, etc. provide a unique glimpse into his family life.  There is also a very well-done documentary on the film itself, and another short featurette on frequent Hitchcock wardrobe designer Edith Head.<br /><br />No Hitchcock fan should be without this well-done DVD.
B0002234LS|4.0|Secret Window is one of those movies that not many people with like or appreaite. Its not action packed nd its not non-stop bloody killing. It's a movie about a writer(Depp) whose losing his touch because he is having a divorce with his wife. He's living in a cabin by a huge lake with no one around for miles. A man shows up claming that he stole \\"his story\\". After that meeting everything goes further than it should. In the beginning it starts a little slow but graduly gets more and more suspensful, even with a little comedy along the way in prime places. The ending (thats all the matters)is very well done and climactic. Some scenes may be a little disturbing, but all in all it's a very good movie.It's true, Stephen King is the master of horror books and movies. I recommend anyone who enjoys things by Stephen King should buy this movie.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Disc1= This is the main movie. It's about a boy who finds out he is a wizard, and is very popular from escaping the evil wizard Voldemort. He goes to Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardy to learn to become a wizard. Good quality, great acting, but not as close to the book as we would have hoped. <br />Disc2 Packed with fun stuff! Get your own wand, Explore Hogwarts, and more! This Movie is a good family film, but may be scary to young children.
B0002I831S|4.0|I bought this set because i really loved the series. All of the first season episodes are here, but they are completely out of order. Yes, they are in \\"airdate\\" order, but when i buy a set like this i expect them to correct that and simply put them in order of occurrence. I actually took the time to watch them in the order of \\"star date\\" (chronologically). I preferred this way due to uniform and personnel changes. This seems like a major oversight by the DVD set's producers. <br /> <br />The extras are wonderful--perhaps too much Shatner, but still informative. I wish there was more on DeForrest Kelly, though. The original first episode should have been included (even though they do include the \\"Menagerie\\" episode, which covers most of it). All in all, not the best set, but i have enjoyed it.
B00003CY6M|2.0|When I read the review I thought it would be a great story.  Both my wife and I liked the idea of the story but we both thought there were too many twists and turns. For a short movie it took a long time to get there and my wife kept going to sleep during the movie.  The acting was okay, especially the store salesman (I've seem him in a recent movie playing a similar character but can't remember where).  This one was a free rental so I got my money's worth.  I was not disappointed that the cubed scene was deleted but I thought the original opening was better than the one they used.  If you are thinking of renting this movie, rent 'Sabrina' instead. This review was based on the DVD.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The Passion of the Christ is a vey beautiful movie. The best movie I have ever seen!!
B000002572|5.0|Boston is of the greatest most powerful bands ever, they created music that is untouchable, their debut album has to be more powerful then other band's entire runs. All I can say is to just turn up your speakers incrediable loud and listen to More Than a Feeling. I'm 17 and out of my entire high school only one other person knows who Boston is, my best friend, I feel sorry for my peers and all of today's youth they miss the greatest music every made, listen to Boston nothing has every been better
B0001NBMBC|5.0|alright, slipknot have come too their sences and released some more melodic album, yeah you guys are right IOWA was pretty dam good, and so was slipknot, but the band have matured and moved on. <br />The shouting part of this album is a treat too listen too and the singing is pretty kool, and here is the big question, are slipknot turning into stone sour, NO THEY ARE F?*CKING WELL NOT! <br /> <br />Slipknot are still slipknot, they still hold that sic feeling weneva you look at them, wen you here them you know that its them, there is still the shouting and screaming, but there is also singing. <br /> <br />Slipknot have also tried something amazing! and acoustic song!, which the band are very good at! Circle and vermillion pt 2 are great songs and i think mick does the backing vocals and if he does then he is showing great talent in singing! <br /> <br />Joeys drumming is on top as normal, but there is no more pointless double bass drum rolls anymore, he only does it when ne\\"sic\\"ary. <br /> <br />There are now great guitar solo's in the album and amazing riffs, some remind me of metalica which isnt that godder thing but hey. <br /> <br />Their masks have had a update and look as sic as ever, especially clowns, I love that guy lol. <br /> <br />Slipknot are a amazing band if only they would lose the masks and the attitude then we would have a perfect band, lets just hope they learn, also you should buy slipknots 1st album \\"mate kill feed repeat\\" you should able too get it on ebay, its interesting too listen too. <br /> <br />Hope you liked this review maggots! <br />SEE YA'LL AND STAY SIC!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I never thought that i would give a slipknot album 3 stars, but this just isnt the real slipknot, or at least the death metal screaming bad words at the top of thier lungs slipknot is not here. There are some good songs like Vermilion( the best), pulse of the maggots, and the blister exists, but a song like circle, or vermilion 2( which is nothing like the regular vermilion ), are ok songs depending on how you look at them, but there not supposed to be slipknot songs. Buy Iowa.
B00003CWTI|5.0|This movie is great. PT Anderson is a great director. and what great ideas. This movie shows a little bit of everyone in it. when i first watched it i felt as though there was a little part of me in every charcter of the film and that's what got me so emotially attached to it and why i loved it so much.  <br /> <br />this moive seems to be very long which it is i think its about 2 hours and 30 minuates(where in somewhat of the parts it drag)the movie is all mixed up, it goes form charcter to charcter and they all tie into together it was kind of like watching the dramatized version of pulp fiction.  <br /> <br />i was really impressed with Cruise's part in the film. he did a really great job of acting like the egotistic male then being complealty sensitive on the inside.
B00000IWVS|5.0|As I listened to this recording for the first time, I found it to be full of strong performances that were nuanced, sophisticated by an artist of boundless technical ability.  That she was, what, 17 or 18 when this live recording was made is unbelievable.  Has she matured in her interpretations?  Of course.  However, you can listen to as many recordings of the Chopin b-minor sonata as you can find and you will not find many you would put on the same shelf with this disk.  It is an amazing performance.<br /><br />The Mazurkas, the Nocturne, the Scherzo in c#-minor, and the A-flat Polonaise are all praiseworthy, beautiful, and personal statements.  It may not match some notions people have of a proper Chopin style (although that term mystifies me - do they mean a Cortot-Chopin style?  Please feel free to email me about this.), but it is beautiful music beautifully played by one of the great pianists of all time - even though she was a mere baby when this live performance was captured for us to treasure for all time.
B00007ELEL|5.0|wow, what an awesome movie, with great performaces by Bridges, Goodman, and Buscemi, the Coens are great writers and directors and this is my favorite film by duo, followed by Fargo. But the film has a great story plot and some intresting \\"trips\\"(including Sadam Hussien giving Brigdes bowling shoes) A deffanite buy for anyone who likes dry humor and most deffinalty 5 out of 5 stars
B00004Z459|5.0|I might be a huge fan of linkin park and I would quickly tell all of you guys in your face that LInkin park rocks! thier albums are so good! but no...thats childish, so Im going to explain why. I don't see why you have to compare them all to other great bands out there. LInkin park is dedicated, talented and a really funny musicians. I love all thier songs, every single damn song. when i first bought the albums I only like, like what? three songs. but if you listen and give the lyrics a chance, u can really relate 2 them. and no, each track is different n unique in its own way. I swear, I never ever skip tracks, they are all good. usually i like like  4 tracks in a album, but i love all of it in linkin park's albums. I believe they have a great future ahead of them.  <br /> <br />peace
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie is great, its probably one of my favorite thrillers of all time, if not my favorite. It adds a certain mystery to everything, just hte idea of bringing Dante and Chaucer into the mix made me smile. <br /> <br />Some people demand this movie is sickning, well it isn't sicning but there are some parts that are kind of weird and where i can see some quiseyness but nothing like throwing up.  <br /> <br />Brad Pitt, Freeman and Paltrow and you know who(from when he played) were excellent it was the only time i've seen Morgan Freeman have some humor in him, besides Nurse Betty. This movie is one of those movies at the end you just want to scream when it all comes together so perfect, it was really neat and somewhat demented. <br /> <br />
B0000027RL|5.0|I have beeen a big fan of Pearl Jam for over four years now and as a fan, I have been disgusted recently by the recent albums that have been released by Pearl Jam. Their best album so far (in my mind) is \\"Ten.\\" Along with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", those CDs represent what grunge really is. Full of great tracks including \\"Alive\\", \\"Black\\" and more, this is a must have for any Pearl Jam fan.
B0002858YS|4.0|I really like this cd, its like they made pop-industerial dance music popular, its really cool and fun. when first heard somebody told me i thohgt hte whole cd would be lke that when in fact a lot of its kind of off shooty rock and poppy but i really enjoy it a lot, keep up the good work!
B0000EMYC1|5.0|\\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is an excellent film, directed by Ron Howard, someone who is sure to be remembered as a legend in his own time for the number of high quality films that he has directed. He is certainly one of the finest directors around today, and this film is certainly reflective of his talent. The technique that he employs to illustrate the descent of John Nash into the world of schizophrenia is highly effective.<br /><br />Loosely based upon the biography of the same name by Sylvia Nasar, the world of schizophrenia is brought to life in this film by a wonderful screenplay, deft direction, and superb acting. Featuring the life of Nobel Prize laureate, John Nash, this film begins to chronicle his life from 1947, when he was a young, promising, though eccentric, graduate student at Princeton University. The film delineates his lack of social skills, eccentricities, rise to prominence,  marriage, and eventual descent into schizophrenic hell. It follows his battle with madness and his own way of coping with his inner demons. It also shows how Nash's early work proved to be so influential that it netted him a Nobel Prize decades later. While a number of people have objected to the fact that this film leaves out some of the darker sides of Nash, one would do well to remember that this is not a documentary but merely a dramatization.<br /><br />Russell Crowe gives a memorable portrayal of the afflicted and tormented John Nash, beleaguered by the devils that existed only in his mind. Ed Harris is compelling as the slightly sinister Parcher, a shadowy government operative whose existence is intertwined with that of John's. Paul Bettany, as he did in the role of Chaucer in \\"A Knight's Tale\\", once again almost steals the show in the role of John's alleged roommate and friend, Charles. Christopher Plummer is excellent as Dr. Rosen, the psychiatrist who appeals to the dormant rationality in Nash. While Jennifer Connelly gives a very good performance in the role of Alicia, John's caring wife, it does not rise to the level of Oscar worthy, though she won an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's Club\\" is a gem of a film with a beautifully nuanced performance by Kevin Kline. When I saw this film in the video store, its descriptive blurb brought to mind films such as \\"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\\", \\"The Dead Poet's Society\\", and even \\"Mr. Holland's Opus\\".  So, I thought it would be a pleasant, sentimental film. Well, it turns out that this film delivers much more than sentimentality, as its themes are far more complex. It is simply a wonderful film with stellar performances by the entire cast.<br /><br />Kevin Kline is superlative in the role of Mr. William Hundert, the assistant headmaster at St. Benedict's Academy, where he is also the  history teacher, focusing on the ancient Greeks and Romans. St. Benedict's Academy is a tony, old world boarding school, steeped in tradition and proud of its high academic standards. Through the teaching of the classics, Mr. Hundert strives to instill in his motivated students old fashioned values, such as leadership,  honor, integrity, and ethics. He himself tries to live his life by those values.<br /><br />This cloistered, comfortable world of his, however, is torn asunder, with the entry of a new student, Sedgewick Bell (Emile Hirsch), the charismatic, troubled son of a U.S. Senator. Unmotivated and mischievous, he enters Mr. Hundert's  life and ends up tearing it apart. Mr. Hundert sees that Sedgewick is innately intelligent, though an under-achiever. He also realizes that Sedgewick has some issues with his influential father that account for his poor attitude. Seeing that Sedgewick has natural leadership ability, Mr. Hundert decides to try to mold him for the common good. His earnest efforts in trying to put the  morally bankrupt Sedgewick on the straight and narrow, however, end up compromising Mr. Hundert's own cherished values. It also gives him a rude awakening. Therein lies the tale.<br /><br />While much of what occurs in the film holds little surprise, it has some intriguing twists and turns that make it a morally complex and multi-faceted film. It is a film with a  message that is particularly applicable in today's win-at-all-costs world, where situational ethics seems to be a by product of the prevailing dog-eat-dog standard. The film reminds the viewer that strength of character does not necessarily exempt one from falling prey to the new ethics promulgated by today's society. Nor are strength of character, goodness, and selfless leadership always rewarded. Sometimes it is passed over for the shallow, showy, and  self-promoting. Life is, simply put, not always fair nor does the end always justify the means.<br /><br />The film is beautifully directed by Michael Hoffman, who displays a deft touch, avoiding mawkishness, and opting, instead, for a more realistic treatment. Kevin Kline is masterful as the highly principled schoolmaster who finds himself ethically compromised and makes a choice that will ripple twenty five years into the future. His portrayal of Mr. Hundert is that of an idealistic human being who is flawed, a man who, when beset by moral dilemmas, does not always make the right choices. Yet, he is a man who is able to come to terms with those choices as his motivations remain true to his ideals.  Emile Hirsch is excellent as the troubled Sedgewick, giving the viewer a peak at the man he is eventually to become. Rob Morrow has a small role as James Ellerby, an ambitious colleague of Mr. Hundert's who has his eye on the prize. Mr. Morrow shines in this small, but important role, as it is a role that runs counterpoint to Kevin Kline's role. While all the loose ends are not firmly tied up at the end of this film, this was a wise choice, as life is not always tidy.<br /><br />This two disc DVD, with two superlative films, is a great package deal and  well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!herein lies the tale.<br /><br />While much of what occurs in the film holds little surprise, it has some intriguing twists and turns that make it a morally complex and multi-faceted film.

0375713751|2.0|First let me state, as the mother of two children, I have done all kinds of work while raising them, worked full time for awhile, part-time, job-shared and am currently working out of the home.  I related a lot to the character's worries and things she felt she had to do to compete in the \\"mommy\\" world, but then she began to lose me as it turned out she was quite unlikeable.  The way she wanted to control everything her husband and nanny did for her children, while she herself was too busy to deal with them, like at the amusement park when she didn't want to order the chicken nuggets because she wanted to be a \\"good\\" mom, even though the nanny knew the kids would like them.  Besides the fact that she didn't feel she could go on vacation alone with two kids and had to bring a nanny along for help made me dislike her even more.  The title is a lie.  She doesn't do it all.  She does her work and occasionally shows up for her children's lives.  I know working mothers who put much more efforts in their kids lives so I'm not slamming working mothers, just creatures like this mom and her ilk.   <br /> <br />Also there were many times in the book when the main character felt justified to treat others badly or look down on them because she's so busy and makes so much money, so she expects everyone to kowtow to her.  I dislike people like that in real life so I didn't feel like reading about one too.    <br /> <br />And as others have stated, you can have a stay at home mom who is just as horrible and may be there in physical presence but not there in any other way, so again this is not a slam against the working mother, but against neglectful parents.  I have stay-at-home neighbors who couldn't do less for their children if they tried.   <br /> <br />So the main reason I didn't like this book was that I just couldn't relate to this main character at all
6305047529|5.0|It's about time they put this on DVD. It's one of the best Danny Kaye movies ever! I definitely recommend it to both Danny newcomers and old viewers. This ones for keeps!
B0000C8AQM|3.0|I'm another one looking for a song in the movie. In one of the scenes where the kids ride with the bus there is a song where you hear the bass a lot and you don't hear any signing. I can't describe it really good since I've only seen the movie once but if you can help me, please email me at: johanlindberg996@hotmail.com .
B0002T7ZKW|4.0|After waiting four long years (and going through one \\"new-wave\\" side-project), I was pumped for new Green Day.  Having been a fan since I was a wee youngen, I had high expectaions...and they were met with \\"American Idiot.\\"  The hard-edged political punk song is fantastic, and is the perfect way to kick off the revival of punk's three princes.  The only reason I could not give the CD a full 5 stars is due to the fact that GD usually has 2 or 3 b-sides, but only one here.  Still fantastic and a must buy.

0446677450|3.0|It took me way longer than usual to finish reading this book, so my review is long due.  The book is only 195 pages long, and not counting the multiple blank pages in between chapters, it is actually about 180 if not less. <br /> <br />The book is more like an inspirational guide which stresses on a few good pointers, and that is why I am giving it 3 stars.  Some of these include: <br /> <br />1.  By having a job, you will more than likely never get out of the middle class (what Kiyosaki mentions as a factor to create what he refers to as the \\"rat race\\").  Furthermore, considering today's economic turmoils and professional demands (specifically in certain fields such as IT, which happens to be my field), your job security is close to none if you don't keep up with technology, changes, and updating your skills (this last one applies to any job).  So financial independence while holding a job is practically impossible, if not at the least extremely difficult.  Basically, by having a job it is more likely you will fall from the middle class (if you are there), and become unemployed rather than become a rich individual.  <br /> <br />2.  You must start early, and learn about investments, money management (and much more than simply balancing a checkbook), and learn how to stay focus when it comes to spending what you have.  It is sad, but one crude truth explained in Kiyosaki's book is how terribly lacking is our education system on teaching all of us how to take care of ourselves financially.  As a prerequisite to my B.S. in CIS and Business Admin. I took many courses, some of the subjects I hated such as Accounting and Managerial Finance, but it was never stressed as it should the importance of these subjects nor were the principles drilled into our brains to make me more financially aware.  Basically, those courses should be taught, I think, when you start high-school (at least the basics), and they should be illustrated many times, to boredom.  Speakers should be invited to illustrate their successes and the importance of these subjects and principles, those who have made it should be brought into the school system to answer questions about \\"how they made it\\", the highlights and pitfalls, the risks involved, and their unforgettable experiences.  I would love to hear Mr. Bill Gates, or Donald Trump, or one of those true business men/women provide me with some of their invaluable advise.  The way we are being taught in schools is a way that will potentially make us all into the slaves of Corporate America, we are extremely dependent on our employers, our lifestyles are dependent on them.  I do not think even 5% of those who went to school with me about 3 years ago have started a business or are on their way to become financially stable.  So in the fact that we're all being trained to be employees instead of business owners (as he mentions many times in his book) is true even for those of us who have taken the route of \\"Business Administration\\", we are taught how to be administrators, but not owners. <br /> <br />3.  The book lacks detail, it does not contain specific guidelines on anything, so that is what mostly disappoints me.  I read another book by Kiyosaki, and the writing style as much as the content were similar in depth as this one.  The advantage this book had over the other one I read was that this one does have some other suggested reading at the end, which I will hopefully have a chance to evaluate in the near future.  As another reviewer wrote in this website, it is best to get yourself a library card and start feeding yourself with material that goes more in depth and provides details about how to invest, what to invest on, all of the different options, specifics about risks involved, how to track those investments, etc. <br /> <br />I usually go to \\"Barnes & Noble\\" and at the least read portions of a book to figure out if it is worth buying it before I decide to consider it a good reference.  This book I bought forabout $4.00 in the amazon.com website (used), I would not recommend anyone pay more than $6 for it, since you will not get richer by reading it, nor will you get some bright ideas on how to get rich or how to start a profitable business, not at all.  However, it is a good book in regards that it scratches the surface of what should be very good areas of concern for all of us, it sort of opens up your eyes and makes you evaluate your current situation.  I will have to become the inside tutor to my children (once I have them) when it comes the time for them to learn about how to start early in their lives in those areas the education system is currently so terrible at. <br /> <br />
B0002I831S|4.0|The series looks and sounds great.  But the packaging is ill-conceived.  The actual DVD's are in a flimsy plastic library held together by tape (really I'm not kidding).  The paper insert has no sleeve to hold it so you have to stick it next to the plastic library in the big yellow case.  There is an additional paper sleeve that wraps around the plastic library but it fits too tightly to be at all practical or convenient.  Whoever designed the casing and packaging should be punished.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Former Nirvana bandmates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl concocted this rushed release and then tried to justify it by saying that if Nirvana fans put up with this, then we would get a box set. Well, Krist, where the f*ck is my box set? Oh, how Krist, Dave, and Courtney must love Kurt. They all loved him so much that they didn't care to even name this compilation of his songs. I think that should tell you that Kurt's former bandmates are as guilty of trying to exploit Kurt's music just as much as some say Courtney Love is. Hey Krist: I sent my regards in the form of a hearty \\"F*ck You\\". You ruined your former best-friend's legacy of great music by refusing to let us fans hear any of it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The first time I heard this album, I was far from impressed. However, the more I listen to it, the better it becomes. This album has so much depth, so many layers to it, it just begs a second, third, fourth, 50th listen. <br /> <br />LISTEN TO THE ALBUM MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE JUDGING IT!
B0002T7ZKW|1.0|I'm torn. Green Day have put out some catchy albums (from the wonderful \\"1039 Smooth\\" up to \\"Nimrod\\"). BUT, I hate their singer/songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong. I just can't stand the ignorant little pixie ass. Basically, if you're not with him and follow his poor and inarticulate views on everything he believes, he mistakes that for a threat, and then proceeds to call you a whole plethora of things you'd expect a 10th grade drop-out to say to you. I don't have a problem with Billie Joe's music ability or his singing for the most part, but his lack of intelligence just irks me. He has a major Napoleon Complex. I guess you can expect that from someone so short and unschooled. Now, don't get all in a huff because I can't stand the little elf. As a whole, the band have put out some good (albeit very simple) albums. All of \\"Warning\\" sucked though. And it looks like the single for \\"American Idiot\\" is continuing the band's recent trend of glaringly-obvious lack of ideas. Maybe the full-length American Idiot album will be better, but I really don't care anymore. I just thought I'd put in my two cents. As far as I'm concerned, Green Day were at their best on their first three EPs (\\"1000 Hours\\", \\"Slappy\\", and \\"39/Smooth\\").
B000002UUX|5.0|Yes,the selloutica vs. Megadeth feud is as old as 1983,but if someone stole my music and furthermore sold albums because they stole my music, I wouldn't get over it either. With Megadeths' Rust In Peace album,they showed selloutica that yes,you stole some of my music,but I'll kick your ass thru making my OWN music better. In my opinion,this cd is pure thrash mayham from open to end,obviously excluding track 8.  Here is my song by song breakdown:<br /><br />Holy Wars:13 out of 10-this song is a \\"DETH\\" classick!<br /><br />Hanger 18:another \\"DETH\\" classick!<br /><br />Take No Prisoners:this is one of favorite all time Megadeth songs,although they never seem to play it live.<br /><br />5 Magics:definitly 13 out of 10 on this killer-ass song,another one of my all time favorites,yet I've never heard it live either.<br /><br />Poison Was The Cure:I always thought that this was a pretty cool song,the lyrics and everything on this song were excellent.<br /><br />Lucretia:13 out of 10!  This song if fu#$ing awesome!<br /><br />Tornado Of Souls:13 out of 10! Very catchy and bad-ass song,great work on this one!<br /><br />Dawn Patrol:not really a song at all,more of a prelude to R.I.P./Polaris<br /><br />Polaris:13 out of 10! Another bad ass \\"DETH\\" song,kind of like \\"Set The World Afire\\"!<br /><br />This is the album that got me into this kind of music,and Megadeth is about the only band from the 80's that I still listen to.  I stole this tape from my brother when I was in the 4th grade,and still,over 10 years later,this album and just about all the other Megadeth releases (except risk) flood my cd player! Long live Vic Rattlehead!!!
B0000797IO|1.0|The box describes this movie as a comedy. The front states \\"Sly, Comic and Touching\\". The back says \\"A Comedy of Winning Delicacy and Heart.\\"  Other mentions are \\"quirky comedy\\", \\"...comical results.\\"  So imagine my surprise when it turns out not to be a comedy at all. It may be good as a drama, but since I bought it, and watched it expecting a comedy, that is what I reviewed it as. If anything it is kind of depressing. If you are looking for something funny, DO NOT buy this movie!  On the UP SIDE. It did have a very little bit of nudity with Jennifer Aniston (not a double)!
B000002H97|3.0|This is the first Mainstream album metallica did. It is in my opinion, there last good album. The songs are slowed down and it isn't as heavy as earlier realises. It has some good songs{enter sand man, Wherever I may roam, and sad but true} It even has some soft songs.Ecch! At the same time Megadeth felt that they could achieve similar success, so they went mainstream, thus resulting in Countdown to extinction. Countdown to extinction is darker, and has no soft songs. I would recomend it over this album. Better yet buy master of puppets by Metallica. It is their best album.
B0001US8FI|5.0|Enter The Dragon was the first United States/Chinese collaboration for the intended release of a major martial arts movie to be produced by, and include the western market. For Bruce Lee, it was the realization and culmination of his greatest goal as an actor to convey himself to the world through the quality and sophistication of the Hollywood movie making industry.<br /><br />The movie that resulted is a showcase for a man who pushed the limits of his own physical abilities beyond all boundaries, for the sake of expressing and exhibiting himself to the world. The magnetism and talent of Lee in such well choreographed fight scenes is simply unparalleled. To many in China, Enter the Dragon seemed to fall short as a vehicle for displaying Bruce's<br />talent in character portrayal on a deeper, more emotional level, as seen in his earlier Chinese film roles. The film was an attempt to break international barriers and, as such, focuses more on presenting groundbreaking action than it does on emotional characterization. As always though, Bruce Lee comes to life in the fight sequences and shines through all pretenses, making this movie a prototype and classic of the highest caliber, creating a standard for all western martial art movies that follow in it's wake to live up to.<br /><br />This 2 disc edition boasts a new 30th anniversary digital transfer and includes a wealth of bonus materials.<br /><br />Disc One:<br />Enter The Dragon (Digitally remastered movie including scenes that were cut from the original theatrical release)<br />Blood and Steel: The Making of ETD (2003)<br />Bruce Lee: In His Own Words (1998) (John Little documentary)<br />Original Featurette (1973)<br />Linda Lee Cadwell Interview Gallery<br />Vintage Home Movie Footage Backyard Workout with Bruce<br /><br />Disc Two:<br />Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey (Previously unreleased Game of Death footage with original Game of Death storyline)<br />Bruce Lee: The Curse of the Dragon (Documentary)<br />Theatrical Trailers<br />TV Spots<br /><br />The only thing I would like to have seen included is the original theatrical release. The cut scenes that were added do not do the movie much justice because of the mismatched voice for the old Shaolin Priest(done by the helicopter pilot for the movie) and Bruce's own stiffness with what does not come across as very natural dialog (the concept behind the dialog is nice to hear though). But that may be just a personal quirk for me. It would be nice to have the option of viewing those scenes separately.n included is the original theatrical release.

0812550706|5.0|I loved Ender's game!  I thought it was one of the most amazing sci-fi books I ever read.  Actually, I usually don't read sci-fi, but I thought it was really fascinating.  Alot of it was about the mind games that government plays and how much control you have over your own life.
038551123X|3.0|This book scared the beeheyseuss out of me. Not since Hannibal has there been a scarier lead. Dexter has wonderful sarcasm and obviously the only ones he really cares about are his sister and all children. <br /> <br />This was one weird book but I was sitting thru one weird hurricane Frances. With the wind howling outside and no electricity I plowed on trying to finish it before darkness arrived.   <br /> <br />It was interesting because Dexter had some redemption at the end, leaving it open for a 2nd 'Dexter'.  Thank heaven it was a short book.  I dont know how to feel about this book. At least I finished it and felt halfway good about the ending.  Hell, I feel good about getting my electricity back on after 7 hours w/o it.

B000001F7R|4.0|Don't listen to the review who gave this a grade F. This is Def Leppards first album and is nothing like their latter albums.I have always thought that this album and High N dry along with Pyromania were their best and they went into too many ballads in the years to come.I saw them after this album came out open up for the SCORPIONS and Ted Nugent and they were great.I seen them a few more times through the years and they do a rocking show.Listen and you will agree that this is a great album.

B00005AR3G|4.0|I love Disney anyway, but actually wasn't that excited when this film came out, nor did I hear anything spectacular about it.  That was probably only because my friends at the time were all college students without kids and nobody had seen it, oh but when we did... we laughed ourselves hoarse!  It's just one laugh after another, pretty much non-stop until the end of the movie, at least it was for the 6 20-somethings I saw it with.  Loved it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is one of the 10 ten best ever.  It has humor, action, suspense, great plots, well-developed interesting characters, and great special effects.  Unfortunately it is another in the long line of horrendous mistakes made by tv executives to Joss's shows, they cancelled it only after airing 11 episodes.  Some of the reviews on here say you'd be better off watching Farscape, Stargate, or Babylon Five, and well, these people have an utter lack of taste and intelligence.  All too often sci-fi shows give up plot and character developement for good special effects, but Firefly has an excellent balance of both.  I recomment buying to dvd to anyone who has a level of consciousness about that of bacteria.  Also, go support the movie, even if it's 1/2 as good as the show it will be awesome.
B00005JMJG|5.0|i've been a passionate film buff for thirty + years (even attended film school for two years), and this is my favorite movie i've ever seen. it boats a literate, passionate, challenging, entertaining and poignant script with something new and definitive to say about love - not hollywood love, but the amorphous concept of love in everyday life. its filmmaking is imaginative, disciplined, and shimmering with creativity. the lead (and some supporting) actors give the best performances of their careers. and in the end, as high minded as the concept is, you walk away feeling you've seen something more grounded in real human condition than most so-called dramas. there's been nothing like this film in our lifetime. it absolutely supports the idea of cinema as art and not just entertainment.
0316168815|2.0|After hearing so many great things about this book, my expectations had been high. It seemed an intriguing idea: a story told from the perspective of a young girl who had been murdered and could watch what becomes of her murderer and family while in heaven.  I agree with the other review that it was off to a very good start.  It was a fast page turner throughout the book.  However the events in the last few chapters of the book were rather silly, especially what becomes of the murderer.  It was a great idea for a story, but the story didn't turn out to be as great as the idea.
0792833236|4.0|and you thought ol' Marty was going to forget this one!! I actually found a copy in the store recently but paid far less than I've seen it in Ebay.  <br /> <br />The film is a classic. On all-time lists. AFI Top 100. Oscars... De Niro's in it with Joe Pesci, Scorsese directed, enough said. Hopefully the film will get limited screening in theaters.  <br /> <br />It's being released at the same time \\"New York New York\\" is being released (which I'm sure people will watch out of curiosity).  <br /> <br />Here's the rundown of the new DVD:  <br />5.1 Surround, anamorphic widescreen.  <br />Scorsese commentary (which is always great to listen to) with editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  <br />Additional cast and crew and \\"Storytellers\\" commentary (participants TBA).  <br />Featurettes (Before the Fight, Inside the Ring are 2 of them) <br />\\"LaMotta Defends Title\\" and \\"De Niro vs. La Motta\\" vignettes, the theatrical trailer and a collectible booklet.  <br /> <br />So far retail is $30, and will be part of a box set with some other of Scorsese's films going for $70.  <br /> <br />
B00005JLEX|4.0|What can i say, what a great show.  New York. <br /> <br />These first episodes weren't my favorite, compared to later episodes.  But, they were still good.  <br />  <br />I guess my only fear with buying this show on DVD is that I've probably seen these episodes too many times on reruns.  That really takes the fun out of it.  Then after I watch them on DVD, I probably won't want to watch them again for some time.  Luckily, season three comes out the same day as this first box set does.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Before I begin, please forgive the rating I gave this album. Amazon won't let me go any lower.    Now, there are so many flaws with this album that I won't bother to do it the justice of reviewing it track by track. This album flat-out sucks. It has no redeeming values at all, no originality, or technicality. What's more, this is basically a carbon copy of Hybrid Theory, so they haven't even progressed in the least. Chester's vocals are all the same, he either whines or screams, and he sounds tone-deaf all the while. It wouldn't hurt to have actual emotion in his voice, either. Shinoda also remains mostly the same, and since he can't rap, this is not a good thing. I don't know the names of their guitarist or bassist, and after two albums of complete crap, I really don't want to. As bad as Chester and Shinoda are, these guys are so terrible, they make Chester seem like Maynard Keenan, and Shinoda like an Asian Tupac. They have no concept of how to play their instruments, and unfortunately, this talent isn't necesary at all because of the atrocious song-writing. Their drummer is easily the second best member of the band, but, again, this is not saying much. He's either below decent, or the band just doesn't like the sound of drums, because there is a severe lack of them on this album. Anyway, he's basically worthless, just like the rest of the band. The only truely talented member is the DJ, Mr. Hahn. Oh wait! This is a a \\"rock\\" album? Sorry Hahn, but you're in the wrong place. But even so, he does create the one song on the album that doesn't make you want to take it back to the store and demand your money back: Session. I actually wouldn't mind if he did a side project and released a CD consisting of songs just like that.     Now that I've gotten the musical aspect of Linkin Park out of the way, or lack thereof, I can concentrate on the lyrics. These are some of the most unoriginal vocals I've ever heard. It's obvious this album is aimed at \\"angsty\\" teenagers, justtrying to be rebellious by listening to \\"heavy\\" music. Hey kids, what's so rebellious about listening to a band that everyone, from your parents to your 7-year old kid brother, listen to? And if you think Linkin Park is heavy, at all, you need a reality check. I could probably accept these lyrics, if they were based on real emotions. Unfortunately, they are clearly not, considering bands have been using this formula to attract fans to buy their albums for quite a while. And Chester, you'll never get over your \\"trauma\\" if all you do is (...)about it. I wonder when he'll grow up.    And lastly, if you are a Linkin Park fan, there is hope. First, turn off your radio, and stop watching MTV and Fuse. Secondly, get into real music. I'd recommened either Indie-Rock bands like Porcupine Tree and Pain Of Salvation, or true metal bands, like Opeth, Children Of Bodom, Emperor, and Edge Of Sanity. So please, don't shell out your money to bands that are in it for just that, the money. Get rid of Linkin Park and Good Charlette, and get into bands that do it for the music, and, for reasons beyond me, are ignored by the general public.
B00005JMUA|3.0|Why did so many people have a problem with this movie, you ask?  It's not brilliant, but it's not terrible, so what's the problem?  Perhaps it was because there was only one effective action scene, or the fact most of the time characters are just bantering to each other?  Maybe it was the inconsistent cheesy camera work or silly canned music?    No, people were upset because this was advertised as a \\"violent\\" movie, when it simply isn't.  True action fans prefer more brutal hard-edged masculine movies like Peckinpah's \\"The Wild Bunch, Siegel's \\"Dirty Harry,\\" Hensleigh's \\"The Punisher\\" or Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver.\\"  In \\"Kill Bill\\" the violence is silly like a kid's movie.  There is also too much female melodrama.  If I want that I'll watch the Lifetime woman's channel, thank you.    Tarantino deserves credit for trying, but unfortunately this is just another one of those \\"hype-movies\\" that will fade into oblivion as soon as the studio's marketing juggernaut runs out of steam.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|I saw this film the first weekend it came out at perhaps hte best single screen theatre in Wash.D.C. ; the Uptown. It has the best of everrything so that any film that uses all that makes film a grand performance is given the full treatment. Saw each of the \\" Lord of the rings\\" trilogy and each was an audio/visual concert. <br />  Then along came this over-indulged piece over of self-indulgent mindless cartoon-character joke of filmmaking showing of how to waste over $100 million. <br />This was the equivalent of the Micheal Cimino debacle after making the masterpiece \\" The Deer Hunter\\" got too much money with no questions asked and gave birth to the budget-bloated largesse that was\\" Heaven's Gate\\".  <br /> Well welcome to \\" Van Helsing'sGate\\". To think of the possible worthy filmmaking projects , with much smaller budgets ,that got short shrift in order to launch this beached whale on Hollywood market-spawn is heart-breaking beyongd words. <br /> All I can say is that only  , upon going to the last  showing of the night , one third of the way into the film the poor acting of even more amateurish scripting finally tipped me over the edge and I began what graduated into relentless , uncontrolable laughter and *no one* in the balcony could bring themselves to tell me to be quiet. They knew what they were witnessing and paid good opening weekend money to do so. <br /> At one point I started to laugh tears and had to get up to go to the rest room to head off laughing myself wet elsewhere. Upon returning to my seat one of friends turned to me and ,by seeing the look on my face , realized the uselessness of even bothering to tell me that I didn't miss a thing. Didn't matter because it just got evermore outrageously ridiculous while being hopelessly stupid & mindlessly awful. <br />  Bottomline: The entire film can summed up by my first impression of what I , and most of the audience by that last quarter , had just laughed through ; namely it was as if some studio gave $100 million to National Lampoon to totally rip into over-bloated Special Effects gothic Horror/Adventure films which serves only as another ILM sfx demo reel. This made \\" League of Extra-Ordinary Gentlemen\\" look like polished work <br />of art. <br /> <br />The *only* reason for any star at all ,  sharing with ILM demo reel fx, was that it was so bad that it was hilarious...for that moment. This does *not* make it worth owning.  <br />*Strongly recommended as a *Rent first* DVD. The spontaneous laughter of the theatre showing was out of desperation in trying to salvage something of an experience out of this collasal waste of 2 hours and over $100 million. <br />   <br /> And after it was all over and we thought we could collectively catch  our breath we  were hit with that last finishing touch that stole whatever breath we had caught. After that bloated fiasco of a film the director put into the credits a dedication to \\" You, Dad\\" which ,considering what we had all just sat through, demanded the response \\" Boy , he sure must have mad at his Father\\". <br /> <br /> I'm sorry , but this film is the poorest of bad jokes that's funny only for how spectacularly it utterly fails. And this was made by supposed professionals. I'm afraid leaving one's mind outside the box office is becoming too much of the common national pastime and unfortunately <br />makes excuses for the next round of thuroughly mindless largesse. <br />Why encourage this. Let's disasterous box office failure be a lesson to the makers of this utter circus of thoroughly mindless nonsense. <br />I've said enough as this film is not worth another word of any kind.
B00005YXZH|5.0|That line above is probably the highest praise I can think of for Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Though the previous Summerteeth was a strong record, YHF finally firmly pushes Jeff Tweedy out of the former Uncle Tupelo's shadow to become an excellent artist in his own right.<br /><br />YHF takes Wilco's alt-country/acoustic pop/folk sound and injects electronics and studio experimentation, somewhat like Radiohead's own masterpiece OK Computer. The result is a truly beautiful and seamless album. Its experimentation (expanses of white noise acting as segues, bleepy synths) is coated with pop sensibility without sounding like a compromise, and the more adventurous tracks like Trying To Break Your Heart and Poor Places are balanced by top-drawer pop on the order of Pot Kettle Black, War On War, and Kamera. The lyrics are truly stirring, left-of-center gems, embodied by the mellow yet evocative voice of Tweedy.<br /><br />The mood is melancholic and lovelorn, most of the tracks conveying longing, sadness, and regret (with the exception of Heavy Metal Drummer, a perfect anthem that's a little out of place on this album). Yet there is always an undercurrent of hope, something that keeps the album from becoming dour even at its most somber. For example, Radio Cure's slurred vocals and softly strummed guitars give way to a truly gorgeous chorus  backed by chiming synths--it totally makes the song. On another note, I'm sure this is a tired sentiment, but I can't think of a more emblematic post-9/11 song than Jesus etc. (\\"tall buildings shake/voices escape singing sad, sad songs\\"). That track makes excellent use of violins as well, something hard to do in a song of this nature without sounding sappy or maudlin.<br /><br />Of course everybody has commented on the beautiful opener I Am Trying To Break Your Heart (love the shuffling drumline on that one), but almost none of the reviews have mentioned the closer Reservations, which is spectacular in its own right. It begins with an uplifting piano melody and Jeff intoning and then repeating some of the most touching lyrics I've ever heard (\\"I've got reservations.../about so many things/but not about you\\"). As the song continues, his voice eventually cuts away, leaving the melody to slowly decay into an almost post-rock soundscape. It's incredible.<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews crying about the \\"noise\\" (methinks these folks would have a hissy fit over Sonic Youth) or the \\"I don't get it's.\\" Disregard the major-label soap opera. If you want a tuneful, tender and ageless album YHF cannot afford to be missed.s with an uplifting piano melody and Jeff intoning and then repeating some of the most touching lyrics I've ever heard (\\"I've got reservations.../about so many things/but not about you\\").

B0000DD7LC|5.0|Alicia reminds me of soul singers of the past. Alicia has a place right beside Aretha and Patti. Her voice is so strong and her music is elegant, classy and funky all at once. She is a needed breath of fresh air in this world of Britneys and Christinas. The best track on here was Diary, for it was so smooth and romantic. Highly recommended.
0790729709|2.0|It's Kevin Costner to the rescue to save Whitney Houston from a vengeful stalker. <br /> <br />Whitney Houston made her film debut with this film co-starring and produced by Kevin Costner. The film got mixed reviews ( more bad than good ) and didn't do so great at the box office. It was the music that was the ultimate highlight. Without Whitney's hit soundtrack, The Bodyguard would have sunk faster than the Titanic. <br /> <br />The Bodyguard disappoints from the getgo with it's half-done plot and unbelievable script. Kevin Costner is disappointing. Back then he'd finished Dances With Wolves and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. His career had never been so high but the bomb of The Bodyguard proved it only takes one film to slow down a career. The major flaw was Whitney Houston. Whitney's acting was terrible despite this being her first film. I was disappointed because I've seen Whitney acting on sitcoms from the 80s and her acting was better then than it was in The Bodyguard. Costner and Houston had no chemistry. Why did they have to be romantically involved? Oh...I remember...to sell those sappy love songs on the soundtrack. That had to be the only reason because the film would have been better without the forced love story. Whitney's character was unbelievable. No one is so self-centered that they will risk their life just to go shopping. Nothing added up and if it wasn't for the soundtrack this film wouldn't be memorable at all. But now that it's twelve years later the soundtrack is even forgettable.  Can't really recommend this DVD. There were no extra features and the movie was only available in standard!  WB has to do better with their DVDs. The Bodyguard has some entertaining points but it can't hold its own with acting, plot or excitement.  <br /> <br />Skip the film but buy the soundtrack. \\" I Have Nothing \\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever made.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore has again demonstrated his unique combination of film-making skill and political consciousness in the film of the year. Moore manages to reveal facts the mainstream media would not report while using humor to great effect. <br /> <br />Regardless of one's own political leanings, Fahrenheit 9/11 is well worth watching and the conversations it will doubtless energize after the film is viewed are well worth having.
B000002HMH|4.0|this album is not as good as great as metallica previous 5 albums -all classics- but at the same time, it's a lot better than what some make it out to be. for the most part, i enjoyed this album. There are some good tracks here: sleepz, king nothin', hero, bleedin', torn. I think the real problem with load/re-load metallica isn't bad music but a ton of filler like poor twisted me, cure and torn within. Metallica released two studio albums (load, re-load), and a live album (s&m), in roughly a three year period. Load would have been much better, and a lot closer to the league of the 'black album' and 'kill 'em all' albums, if they had combined the best of their load sessions into 1 cd, and dumped the rest. Load (which should have been named 'outlaw torn' like someone else suggested)should have looked something like this:  1 fuel  2 outlaw torn  3 devil's dance  4 no leaf clover  5 king nothing  6 minus human  7 the unforgiven 2  8 the memory remains  9 where the wild things are  10 until it sleeps  11 hero of the day  12 bleeding me  13 i disappear
0767827716|4.0|\\"Christine\\" is about possession. In adapting Steven King's novel to the screen, director John Carpenter and writer Bill Phillips streamline King's narrative to focus on the true star of the book and film--the car itself. \\"Christine\\" tells the story about a nerdy high school senior (Keith Gordon in a very strong performance)who can't do anything right but his best friend college jock Dennis(John Stockwell)seems to do everything right. So when Arnie finds the perfect car that he can rebuild and put his love into, the car nicknamed \\"Christine\\" by its former deceased owner more than returns that love--she gives Arnie a thug makeover and turns him into a monster as bad as the the kids that used to beat Arnie up. Needless to say, Christine has some special abilities of her own and she becomes--so to speak--the vehicle for Archie's revenge and vice versa.<br /><br />Dennis tries to intervene but once Arnie becomes possessed by Christine, he and Arnie's new girlfriend Leigh (the lovely Alexandra Paul in her first film role)are unable to reach him. A local police detective (Harry Dean Stanton)becomes suspcious but isn't able to prove that Arnie had anything to do with a mounting body count consisting of high school students from Arnie's school.<br /><br />The beautiful transfer here manages to skip many of the flaws that have become a Columbia Tristar trademark; the edge enhancement is minimal and the sharp, detailed picture has vivid rich color recalling the original look of the theatrical cut of the film. The high definition transfer is as sharp as a rebuild car after a top notch paint job.<br /><br />Duplicating the wonderful format that director John Carpenter has used on \\"The Thing\\", \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\" and \\"Escape from New York\\", the audio commentary features both the director and star Keith Gordon (now a director himself) discussing the nuts and bolts of making the film. Gordon provides a unique perspective as both the film's star and also an acclaimed director of small, independent films.<br /><br />While I also like King's books, I'd like to point out that to make a feature film of a novel would take (as writer Bill Phillips astutely points out in the special features section)20 hours or more so novels have to be streamlined in the hopes of capturing the feel of the film. It's hoped that the visul style brought to the film will make up for the narrative threads that are lost and Carpenter's film does just that. While LeFey the previous owner of Christine played a major role in the book, it seemed as if he was the one driving the action. Carpenter and Phillips decided that Christine was just born bad and that evil spilled out to possess their owners as well. I found Carpenter and Phillips choices in turning the novel into a film to be very good ones.<br /><br />Laurent Bouzereau's three excellent featurettes focus on the conception of the film all the way through the production and release. Oddly enough, though, Columbia has them listed out of order under the special features section starting with \\"Christine Fast & Furious\\", \\"Christine Finish Line\\" and \\"Christine Ignition\\" presented in that order. You should really watch the last one first, the first one second and the second one last. Of course, you can click on them in any order (they play individually)but it does seem a curious choice to present them this way. We also get 20 deleted/alternate scenes that provide an interesting addition to the original film. While Carpenter wisely chose to cut some of them, a small portion of the deleted scenes would have made a great addition to a \\"Director's Cut\\" of this film. Since Carpenter is technically \\"retired\\" (as he jokingly points out in his commentary), he certainly could spent the time to reintegrate key scenes. Unfortunately, it's doubtful that this special edition had the budget for such an undertaking. Regardless, I'm happy that Columbia Tristar elected to put out this special edition in the first place.<br /><br />We also get the usual Columbia Tristar previews as well. This special edition provides a classic Carpenter film a second change on DVD. While the film was critically well received (Time called it \\"Carpenter's best film since 'Halloween')for the most part (many criticized the foul language. Writer Bill Phillips discusses how Columbia's executives asked him to add more foul language so the film could earn a hard \\"R\\" rating. He laughes as he recalls that \\"Scarface\\" would soon replace \\"Christine\\" with the most foul lanugage in a two hour movie), it only did fair box office business.

B000002BBY|5.0|I used to hate Oasis.  Back in '95, I despised them.  They were posers, they were ripping off the Beatles, they were snot rock. I found a copy of \\"What's the Story (Morning Glory)?\\" in one of my friend's cars, shook my head at it and, to parrot what I thought was an utterly brain-damaged rhyme sighed, \\"Pretty shi**y (little kitty).\\" <br /> <br />About a month later I was hanging out watching TV at that same friend's apartment. We had the sound turned down on MTV and the closed captions were on and \\"Champagne Supernova\\" came on.  I watched the lyrics (\\"How many special people change? How many lives are living strange?\\") and began to cackle.  \\"We have to hear this crap,\\" I said, and turned it up. <br /> <br />But what I heard when I cranked up the volume was not just a damn good song, but also a song I already knew from the radio, a song I'd heard and liked and was actually trying to figure out the name of.  I had, without my own knowledge, become an Oasis fan.  Before I left, I ended up copying the entire album. <br /> <br />Of course, now, nearly 10 years later, \\"Morning Glory\\" is a rightfully established classic album.  Oasis went on and kind of became something else and it's too bad they couldn't sustain this level of quality and energy, but at least they produced one of those rare albums on which practically every song is a perfect, rock-radio gem. \\"Morning Glory\\" is yet another one of those I listen to for long stretches of time and put away but eventually come back to.  Sometimes I only want to hear \\"Wonderwall,\\" sometimes \\"Roll with It,\\" sometimes \\"Don't Look Back\\" or \\"Cast No Shadow.\\"  Currrently, I'm re-grooving on the whole record because I recently watched the excellent Brit-pop documentary \\"Live Forever\\" and it got me back into it.  <br /> <br />Another friend recently revisited me yesterday afternoon while I was cranking the title track and said, \\"Damn, remember when you used to hate these guys?\\"  I do, but it was a long time ago.
B000089RVX|5.0|I was never a fan of Evanescence but after I heard \\"My Immortal\\" and saw the music video for it, all I could think was \\"Wow.\\" so I purchased the CD and I'm absolutely in love with it.  Contrary to what many reviewers think, I don't think all of the songs are about death.  Yes, many of them have depressing themes but if you listen to the lyrics I'm sure you'd find them absolutely beautiful, as is Amy Lee's voice.
0066620996|4.0|This is a stimulating and thought provoking book and I think that most businesses could improve their sales and profitability by adopting some of the book's key concepts such as \\"First Who...The What\\", \\"A Culture of Discipline\\" and \\"Hedgehog Concept\\".  However like most management books there is little attention to tactics and detail and too much focus on the 25,000 ft strategy.  There is no doubt in my mind that the book contains many valuable insights that could benefit nearly all companies around the world even if they don't end up as \\"great\\".   Collins is too concerned with the rigorous analytical approach that excluded some of today's largest and most profitable companies such as Walmart, Berkshire Hathway and Procter & Gamble.  On the other hand the book is light on tactics - how have companies gone about getting the right people on and wrong people off  without loosing key knowledge, how have they ensured that customer service was maintained during the transition, have they adopted an strategy of revolution or evolution in their HR policies.   <br /> <br />Nonetheless the key concepts are farsighted and very helpful.  Don't expect to grasp all the concepts and implications on the initial read.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the \\"Hedgehog Concept\\" on first reading but have come to realise that for me this is perhaps the most influential concept in the book.  Being able to identify the key \\"economic denominator\\" to focus the business on and making sure that the whole organisation is focused and orientated around this is a very far reaching concept but requires a very strong culture and discipline to sustain. <br /> <br />In summary this is an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone in a position of responsibility in business.  Don't worry to much about the overall concept of good to great but focus rather on how the key ideas may help develop your business.  Strong on the \\"what\\" rather than the \\"how\\". <br />
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I originally bought this album because I heard \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" (theme song to \\"One Tree Hill\\") and loved it.  I was pleasantly surprised when I actually loved the rest of the album as well.  He has a great mix of music which makes it hard to put him in any one type of genre.   <br /> <br />Take songs like \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Meaning\\" in which he delivers the lyrics with such heartful yearning.  Other songs that I enjoy are \\"Chemical Party\\", \\"Crush\\", and \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" which have a heavier sound.  I really can't pick out one song that I like the best because there are so many. You can definitely here the influence of Stevie Wonder in his songs. Gavin DeGraw's voice at times reminds me of a young Stevie Wonder, yet he has a sound all his own.     <br /> <br />I think Gavin DeGraw is one of the best new artists in the music business today.  It's refreshing to hear true soul coming back into music.  I wish there were more Gavin DeGraw's out there.  But, I guess if there where this one wouldn't be so special.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is one of those films that will have you intrigued from start to finish. Along with action packed mind blowing sequences it offers a mysterious and intersting storyline that is very gripping. The only problem with the Matrix is that the story line can be hard to understand at first, but give it another watch it's well worth understanding.
B00004RJ74|5.0|i just love it when movies don't follow the typical hollywood genres and go their own way and that is exactly what this movie did. first time i watched it i didn't know it was a vampire movie, but it surprised me. i wish the special effects would have been better, and the storyline goes a little wacko after the invading swarm of vampires come in, but still an excellent movie. i have watched it over and over, especially the belly dancing scene with salma hayek. quentin tarentino played the part of the murdering rapist a little too well, almost good enough to make one wonder. it's just too bad that the sequels couldn't live up to the original.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I hoped for alot more in the finale of one of the greatest triologies of all time, and unfourtunatly the Wachowski bros dont really deliver it in the third installment of the Matrix. It's filled with amazing action sequences, but unfourtunatly thats really all it has to offer. The storyline pretty much takes a fall and the ending is pretty dumb in my opinion. I almost wish now that I could have been left in the \\"cliff-hanger\\" position after the first movie, but even so the Matrix Revolutions is still a decent film and especially if you liked the first two editions its worth checking out. If you didn't like the Matrix Reloaded my advice would be to steer away from this one. Rent it before spending your money on it otherwise some may be disapointed.  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore is having this film released about a month before the election, and for anybody who might still be \\"on the fence\\" about who to vote for, this film will no doubt sway your vote towards the lesser of two evils in the voting booth this year. <br /> Micheal Moore has been accused of exaggerating the truth and just giving half facts in his documentaries, but in this film he, for the most part, keeps his opinions to himself and let's the video footage of president Bush do the talking. <br /> Just based on the audio and video footage that have been taken in the past, one would really start to think that Bush is probably the most idiotic and crooked president that we as a nation have ever had and Moore's Farenheit 9/11 erases all doubt. <br /> If president Bush is so great then this movie should pose no problem come election time, but, from the looks of things, the republicans know that Moore is right and his little documentary is a serious blow to Bush's chances of getting re-elected. <br />         THANK YOU MICHEAL MOORE!!!!!!!
B000002KHH|5.0|In it's time it was an amazing album and today that still remains. Unlike the other hippie rock bands of the decade Sabbth gave its listeners an a$$ kickin. Paranoid is very simple but very powerful, It's riffs may be far from complex but none the less definative and legendary. Unless you have been living in a box your entire life you have probably heard some of these songs. Iron Man, Paranoid, and War Pigs all powerful songs that put Sabbath on the map as the gods of metal. It's by far Sabbath's most influential album and any metal, hard rock, or classic rock fan should have this album in their collection.
0767817486|3.0|The movie was fairly accurate.  The penalties for drug smuggling are severe and were realistically represented in this film. <br /> <br />However, I do have to object to the portrayal of abuses and tortures occuring in Turkish prisons.  This film seemed to paint the Turks as sadistic and vicious in the running of their correctional facilities.  In isolated cases, this may occur but in much lesser degrees than this movie displays. <br /> <br />I know this firsthand because I did a five year stint in Turkish prison.  Admittedly, I am a little more backboned than the average American tourist who finds himself getting pinched while trafficing Hashish out of Turkey but I could easily have done the entire 5 years standing on my head. <br /> <br />I certainly don't want to be a Turkish inmate again but if circumstances held it in the cards that I was required to serve another 5 year stint, I wouldn't even flinch but suck it up like a man. <br /> <br />I'm not saying it's Disney world over there, kids.  IT'S NOT!  Don't follow my mistakes.  But movies like this severely exaggerate the life inside a Turkish prison. <br /> <br />Turkish prison guards look at American drug smugglers much the same way as American prison guards look at \\"celebrity gangsters\\" here in the States.  For an American drug smuggler, Turkish prison life would more accurately be portrayed by the scenes in Goodfellas rather than by the scenes in Midnight Express.  In my case, since I am not Italian, rather than making pasta and garlic tomato sauce, they overlooked my contraband of pork chops and mashed potatos. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00016POFE|5.0|What an outstanding release from PT!! It won the SMA (Surround Music Award) for Best Surround Mix of 2004. The recording should be given a Grammy for Best Recording!!<br /><br />It follows a natural progression in music development that started with the release of Stupid Dream, then Lightbulb Sun (both being remastered and re-released in 2005 with one or both being released in 5.1 surround format!!), followed by this incredible masterpiece. Don't miss this one!!!<br /><br />Looking forward to their new CD in Jan. 2005 (a 5.1 mix of the new music is due by Feb. if not released simultaneously)
B00005JMEW|5.0|I loved this movie! It was filled with many action packed moments. It really makes you wanna see the second. Some people probebly won't be able to handle this movie. I bought this and my parents borrowed it from me since my dad was a man who loved action. They both watched 5 minutes and took it out. I loved it an many of my friends did too. It was a great action movie and I can't wait to see the second!
B00003CXCT|5.0|For those of you who are crying about the fact that you can't buy the original versions, tough crap.  I can just see you making that face Luke makes when Vader tells him he's his father-pathetic.  You don't seem to realize that George Lucas created these movies, they are his vision, and just because we made them popular, it is his right to release whatever version HE feels is the best representation.  Plus you should realize that he will eventually release the original version to get some sales when everything has slowed down after episode three.  As for the movies themselves, they are classics.  For most folks who grew up with them, you know the dialogue, you know the characters, you know that there will never be movies that you love as much, what more is there to say?
B00026W82U|4.0|This is a great cd.  Not a 5 (this is no White Album or Purple Rain), but certainly a 4.  The lyrics are better crafted.  The use of bossanova sounds and upbeat rhythms add a fun layer to their style.  The two seem more comfortable with writing songs in English. <br /> <br />Having Leslie Feist was a brilliant idea to contribute to \\"Know How\\".  The three voices blend so well in the song, you'd think they've been singing together for ages.  Other standouts are \\"Homesick\\", \\"Misread\\", \\"Love is No Big Truth\\", and \\"I'd Rather Dance With You\\" (a song I didn't like at first, but gets better with each listen).   <br /> <br />One big criticism:  I could have done without the trumpet in the end of \\"Sorry or Please\\".  I hear Erlend is self-taught.  It sure sounds like it. <br /> <br />Otherwise, this is a very good album.  I rate it a Buy It.
B00005JNEI|1.0|How can a political piece be labeled a documentary?  Creative editing is liberally employed, I did my homework.
B00008H2LB|5.0|okay guys this cd is one of the best ones i have ever heard. some people diss rock just because of the sound but this cd have nothing bad about it. first thing is the best song on the cd is breaking the habit a great single. and 2nd is nobodys listing. so even if you dont like rock music you should pick this cd up.
B00001U0DP|4.0|The first half of this film was a fun lighthearted sweet romantic comedy, which really contrasts with the second half, which despite having some funny moments, is very serious and depressing in tone, almost as though it were an entirely different movie.  The second half of the movie gives me mixed feelings; I believe Benigni's heart was in the right place when he made this movie, but by and large the second half is so unrealistic and even tasteless in parts that it insults what really happened.  I was even sick to my stomach when Guido was making light of how Giosue had told him that he'd heard that people were being made into soap and buttons and being burnt in ovens, joking about washing himself and buttoning up with their friends in the Barracks and how the ovens weren't burning people fast enough, trying to make him see how \\"ridiculous\\" it was to believe such things.  And what camp are they supposed to be in that has such horrible security and where a child not only goes ungassed on arrival but also undetected the entire time he's there?  There were instances where underage inmates or invalids who had been smuggled out of the hospital were able to be hidden for a time, but before long nearly all of them were found out, and the person or people hiding them were likely killed also.  The voiceover at the end suggests that this is a true story, though I have a hard time believing that.<br /><br />I can accept that some things had to be modified for practical purposes while still conveying the truth of what happened; for example, not stuffing the cattle car with as many people as the Nazis really stuffed into them, or the actors playing the inmates not dropping down to 40 pounds each, but what remains is still unrealistic (albeit well-meaningly so).  People aren't greeted with screams, kicks, beatings, slaps, curses, and barking dogs when they unboard the cars (in a very orderly way!), their heads aren't shaved, the portions are too large and healthy-looking, there is no Kapo or other sadistic prisoner put in charge of the inmates in the Barracks, no searchlights till the very end, an incredibly unrealistic evacuation of the camp, too many prisoners alive (and healthy-looking) at the end on the death march that is liberated, and no security.  We know this camp has a gas chamber, so it can't be one of the milder camps like Westerbork where families could be together and children were allowed to live, yet if it had been one of those types of camps, the child wouldn't have had to be hidden either.  This camp has so little security it's like a revolt and escape waiting to happen!  And where is the delousing process that greeted the prisoners lucky enough to live (during which Giosue would certainly have been detected), where they had to undress, got their heads shaved, were driven into an icy-cold shower, were thrown raggy prisoner rags, and had to pick a pair of shoes, no matter how ill-fitting or mismatched, from a mammoth pile of them?<br /><br />If this were a real Vernichtungslager, the child would have had no doubts about what kind of place they really were in.  The few children selected to live (for medical experimentation or sexual exploitation primarily) didn't have any doubts about where they were or what was happening to them.  In a real extermination camp, the Kapo or whomever was put in charge of each Block rounded up the people trying to escape going off to work each day and beat them.  That child would have been detected during one of these searches to see if anyone were hiding in there and trying to avoid labour.  The Nazis were constantly counting the prisoners and searching the Barracks and other buildings to make sure everyone was accounted for and that no one was trying to hide!<br /><br />Overall it was a very sweet movie about a father's love for his son (and in the first half how he won the heart of the boy's mother), but unfortunately the inaccuracies in the second half spoilt some of my enjoyment of this movie.  And as well-meaning as the people who produced this movie may very well have been, it unfortunately will be fodder for the historical revisionists, who will point to it as \\"proof\\" that the Shoah really wasn't all that bad.his movie.

B00029LNHS|1.0|THIS CD IS CRAP. I WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE IT 1 STAR. I HEARD A FEW SONGS ON THIS CD AND I HATED THEM WITCH TRIGGERED ME TO BREAK IT IS HALF AND THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW! I HATED THIS CD IT IS FILLED WITH TRASH!
B0002DB52M|3.0|Some reviews suggest Grace as a Jesus figure. That may be true; but if it is, the Jesus is the one who threw the money changers out of the temple. <br /> <br />What a movie says and what the director thinks it says can be  two different  things. I suspect the director wants  us to experience revulsion at the final revenge which is obviously \\"over the top.\\" On the other hand, I found the real meaning in the conversation between Grace and her father in which she first argues the liberal view of forgiveness of any and all behavior. Her father tells her this is \\"arrogant\\"  and basically  argues that it represents \\"the soft bigotry of low expectations.\\" She ultimately comes to agree with him that the town's behavior  is simply unacceptable and her revenge is the result. <br /> <br />We see this also in the bahavior of the town people. Tom is an obvious liberal -- attempting  to manipulate the town to his definition of good and moral. When push comes to shove, though, he joins in the exploitation of the victim for his own gain. <br /> <br />Vera, with her absolute aversion to punishing her children is another modern liberal. While her children are allowed to fester as spoiled brats, though, she is more than willing to destroy Grace's children in the form of her figurines. <br /> <br />Either Lars has a decidedly conservative streak, or he really missed his mark!
B00005JMCN|5.0|Usually I shy away from animal movies as I expect to cry unceasingly viewing the cruelty of man, and the disasterous experiences endured by the animal, be it dog, cat, horse, etc., depicted in them, but I found <br />Seabiscuit, the movie, a thorough delight!  Though Seabiscuit the horse, had an unhappy early life, that part of his existence is only alluded to in the movie, which picks up the life of Seabiscuit when Charles Howard buys him.   <br /> <br />Background introduction of the characters is done with an eye to creating empathy in the viewer which carries one through the film with better understanding of motives and actions of those characters.  While not completely factual, (i.e., the birthplace of John \\"Red\\" Pollard is incorrect and no mention is made of his marriage or wife; Chas. Howard's son died at age 15, not 12; no other vehicle was involved in the fatal accident, he over corrected while driving his dad's truck and  tumbled into a steep ravine), on balance it depicts a fairly true rendering of history. <br /> <br />I am not old enough to remember the races but I do remember the name Seabiscuit being talked about long after he was gone.  Living close to Santa Anita racetrack at the time there was much discussion about Seabiscuit and his outstanding racing wins.  Now, living close to where Seabiscuit is buried and Ridgewood Ranch is located, the movie took on real significance for me.  <br /> <br />Even when you know the \\"little guy\\" (Seabiscuit) will win the races, the movie still puts you on the edge of your seat.  I thought Jeff Bridges did a good job as Charles Howard, unlike many of his usual roles.  Tobey McGuire probably was a better Spiderman, but he did a creditable job as jockey \\"Red\\" Pollard.   <br /> <br />All in all, you can't spend much better time in viewing a movie than in watching this version of \\"Seabiscuit\\".  Hats off to the author of the book....without it there would not have been this version brought to the screen. <br /> <br />Gosee it, rent it, buy it....decide for yourself.  <br /> <br />
B000068IEU|4.0|A disturbing, low-low budget mood piece, the first major film for future \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" and \\"Friday the 13th\\" directors Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham, \\"The Last House on the Left\\" is not for anybody who's even remotely faint of heart.  It takes us to the bowels of human depravity, showing us graphic violence with fake blood that actually looks like real blood. <br /> <br />Two teenage girls set out to score some grass before attending a shock-rock act, and are captured, tortured, humiliated, and finally savagely murdered by a \\"family\\" of twisted creeps, the kind of people you feel filthy just watching.  This group of barbarians end up at the house belonging to the parents of one of the girls, and the parents indulge in a little graphic revenge. <br /> <br />In my original IMDB review, I gave it a very negative review because of its depravity and what I perceived as ineptitude on the part of the film-makers.  After seeing it again, I have mellowed towards it somewhat but I must state that THIS ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY.  Don't watch it if you're squeamish to begin with. <br /> <br />I also thought originally that the music and songs were dumb; that's not quite true - David A. Hess, who plays the part of the feral and disgusting \\"Krug\\" Stillo, also did the music and he IS a competent enough composer and musician.  I just thought that it was dumb because upbeat folk/country music is played at what I think are inappropriate times. <br /> <br />As for the actual DVD, it DOES get high marks, offering a 29-minute featurette, \\"forbidden\\" footage (I'm not looking forward to checking out THAT extra!), the obligatory Original Theatrical Trailer, a commentary with Craven and Cunningham, and the chance to view the film with a brief intro by Craven himself. <br /> <br />The featurette is pretty informative and it's interesting to see what the actors look like in recent years (the biggest change is in Fred Lincoln, who played the pervert \\"Weasel\\"). <br /> <br />If you canstomach the film, I think that you will most likely enjoy this DVD.
0451169514|4.0|i am a little surprised to see how so many people thought this book to be scary. i found it to be quite light in the horror department, especially considering the small amount of horror displayed in the large canvas of the novel. and for all of you who are thinking of reading it (and for those of you who have read it and missed the point of the book), the primary intention of IT is not horror. that is secondary at best. <br /> <br />IT is a lot like an elongated version of the stephen king novella 'the body'. in other words, it is a story that focuses on childhood nuances. king shows us what the characters are like at age 11 and at age 39. instead of seeing how the children mature, we just see both ends of the spectrum and watch as the 39 year old characters relive their youth. while most stories focus on kids maturing into adults, this book shows us adults regressing into children. <br /> <br />the book goes back and forth between the two eras, reading a lot like the way the movie 'pulp fiction' did. we see the story piece by piece and it ends up unravelling before our eyes. in that sense, it is very well written. however, i found some of stephen king's writing style to get a little annoying after awhile. near the end of the book there are a couple of chapters that are all a single paragraph (it is really annoying to read through a 5-page paragraph). and there are a couple chapters that are all italics (again, annoying). and after a while his style of breaking up a sentence between chapters (and between past and present) gets to be a little overdone. and i hate how EVERY single book he writes has to have some form of sodomy in it. it's a cheap tactic to get people to feel uneasy and mr. king, if you are reading this, we get it.  <br /> <br />basically the point of the book is NOT to be scared. and if that is all you take out of it then you have a lot of maturing left to do; this book is NOT about some stupid clown. the point of this book is similar to the point ofall good books and movies; it is to make you think after all is said and done. after putting this book down, if you are not able to reflect on your own childhood then you missed the boat. and i feel sorry for you if you did because it is a wonderful journey.  <br /> <br />after reading it i began to think of my own childhood and i was able to relive memories that i forgot even existed. memories of old friends and old places that i never thought i would forget when i was a child. and therein lies the REAL horror that this book brings up. the horror of realizing that you yourself are getting older and you will never be able to see the world the same way that you once did. because life goes on and with it comes new challenges and new memories, and you realize that soon you too will forget all over again what it felt like to be a child. <br /> <br />that is what IT is about. <br /> <br />(i only gave it 4 out of 5 because of the annoying components and the lack of pure horror that one would expect from reading a thousand-plus page horror book).
B0002S94OS|5.0|this guys have gottin ahelluva lot better, i used to hate, good cd, should pick it up
B00004YYDI|5.0|I watched this movie yesterday after 3 years and I fell in love with the movie.  It was a very thrilling movie, you want to know each moment what would happen next.  I truly understood the depth of the relationship between Matilda and Leon, which I failed to when I saw the movie 3 years ago.  It was a very touching relationship. <br /> <br />I enjoyed watching the movie!
B00023BLXK|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was a pleasant surprise. <br />I also enjoyed Patrick's appearance in this movie as a dance <br />instructor. It makes me wish that I was one of his dance students. I would highly recommend this movie.  It was very heartful and  romantic. I am definately going to get the soundtrack.  The music and the dancing was energetic, tantalizing, and sensational!
0340832371|4.0|but should I say &quot;these&quot; books?<br />Built as multiple narratives one in another, each section is quite enjoyable on its own. Although the links between each part sometimes feels a bit stretched and the flow of reading halted by the insertion of yet another narrative (hence my rating of 4 stars vs 5), the total does become more than the parts and makes for excellent reading. Highly recommended.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|This is the original action packed Robocop.  Through the various TV commercials and news reports that are displayed throughout the film a social comment is made on society showing our in-humane and greedy ways.  Of course this film is extremely violent and shouldn't be viewed by a younger audience, but anyone who can take the carnage will enjoy what this film has to say.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is an amazing f*cking album, and yet another example of how Tool doesn't just create music, but beautiful and complex art that stimulates the mind and soul. Although many complain that this album lacks the dark, raw, and cynnical vibe of its predecessors, I liked the fact that this album bore more uplifting messages while still retaining the same overwhelming power and that cryptic(and almost otherworldly) spark that Tool thats sets Tool apart from all other metal bands. Love it or hate it, no one can deny the awesome power and depth of Lateralus. On a side note, I would just like to add how pitiful it really is to read reviews of people who happen to think they are on a higher level just because of the simple fact that they listen to Tool- If the reason you listen to Tool is to brag because Maynard is a lyrical genius, you missed the point entirely. Tune your friggin egos down for a reality check, you dumb and misguided fools-Britney Spears listens to Tool and shes no Einstein.
B0001IN07Q|2.0|Clearly this guy is very talented. (Great voice, excellent intonation, decent phrasing.) But it seems it is all about his self-perceived coolness and not about the music.  The guy(s) he is trying to emulate made their mark by being great interpreters of great songwriters. The cool factor followed. Not so for Buble. The songs take a back seat to the perception  he trying to create. Watch the horrible DVD and count the number of times he says \\"I\\" or \\"me\\". He never talks about the songs or the music, only about Michael. His ego gets in the way of the music - you can hear it. <br /> <br />Also the sound on all but the first two cuts of the CD is horrible. He either kept the house mics opened the whole time or added delay and reverb in the mix. Whichever, it sounds like it was recorded in a very large men's room with Buble sitting on the can while the crowd cheers him on. <br /> <br />Besides the more-of-me aspect of the DVD - it is just BAD. Dis-jointed, choppy, shaky. (A note to editor: we are not all ADD victims.)  This video is so bad, I propose a new federal law: you gotta have a license to use a DV cam, Final Cut Pro and release it on DVD. <br /> <br />The whole thing is so... aaaa...so... yucky. I gotta take a shower now. <br />

B0001VTPWM|5.0|This is the Robocop Trilogy including all three action packed instalments.  Of course the original Robocop is the only one that really makes it a point to comment on society the other 2 are still entertaining.  Although this boxed set only includes special features for Robocop 1 and only trailers for 2 and 3 it's the only way to get the \\"Extended Cut\\" of Robocop, which contains 1 minute of extra gore I beleive.  So, the price is right, and this is worth the purchase for any scifi/action fan.
B000007T1M|5.0|Although I must admit I hated System of a Down at first; being an avid fan of bands such as Korn, Disturbed, and Godsmack, I was totally unwilling to adjust to such a different sounding band. That all changed the day my brother bought this album and burned me a copy-this album was the key that opened me up to the rest of their albums - the combination of Serg's wide range of vocals(crooning one minute and screaming the next)and Daron's sick guitar stylings give this band an edge that is crazy, fun,and terrifying all at once. Irresitably awesome. <br />Even if you think its just noise, give the album a listen and keep an open mind-It might just blow you the f*ck away.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is a special cd.  Every single song is gorgeous. One member of our family has described Parachutes as \\"magical\\".  This is that rare cd that can be played time and time again without tiring of.  It is that good. The arrangements are top notch, the lyrics are well written. Cold Play is a class act.
B000006045|5.0|Nothing more can be said about this album....I am just voting to give it another 5 star boost. <br /> <br />MYEAH
B00005JMAH|5.0|I wasn't at all a fan of the HARRY POTTER franchise because I was lead to believe that these stories were strictly for children.  On a lark I went to see HP AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN and thought it was brilliant!  I even got the director's Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN in joke(naughty boy).  But what made it more appealing was that there was more depth in the characters, it seemed to me that more was at stake, emotionally.  The dementors in particular were frightening.  I still can't believe I was under the impression that these books are for children.  I think they are more about children rather than for children. I have since read the third book and still say the director and the screenwriter (the same for the past two movies) were spot on with their adaptation.  What really impressed me were the performances of Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, very much improved since the last two films and I hope they are around for the conclusion of the series of films.  I hope that these two actors continue with their careers after this franchise is over.  I have read books four and five and am chomping at the bit for book six to come out.  If it weren't for how good this third movie was, I wouldn't even have bothered trying to know more about the Harry Potter universe.  I'm converted and am trying to get as many of my adult friends converted too!  Great film and books for children and adults!    I just recently rewatched the movie on the big screen and I stick to my original thoughts that is was a FANTASTIC movie.  The pacing was faster, the stakes were higher for the characters, and the adventure more sweeping.  I have read the third book and the main two things that are missing are the references to the Marauder's, which I've heard would be covered in a different film, the extended arguments between Ron and Hermione, and the significance of Crookshanks (which I feel works in the book better, if presented in a movie, it would have seemed too contrived).    I hope that this film in the series gets some recognition *hem hem* Best Adapted Screenplay *hem hem*.  For a movie about 2 1/2 hours long is flows pretty quickly with an intriguing plot and characters.  This is a MUST SEE in the series.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Well, Meteora is really how I started getting into Linkin Park. I have to say, it's a great CD. Yeah sure, it is formulatic. So what? I still like it. From the hard rock of Faint to the very un-Linkin Park'like Breaking The Habit, this is a great album. <br /> <br />Standout tracks: <br />Don't Stay <br />Lying from You <br />Faint <br />Breaking the Habit <br />Numb
B00008ADPF|5.0|This is one of the best cd's i have ever heard, i only dislike one or two songs at the most, if you have liked the there cd's in the past, or like there song, &amp;quot;Someday&amp;quot;, then you will like there cd, it is good, and it will never get old!
1582432678|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Very difficult to put down.
B00005JL78|5.0|Years before Voice-Stress Analyzer, routine polygraphs, and personality profiles, Phillip K. Dick asked the interesting question: Is intent to commit the crime automatic guilt? In Minority Report, Pre-Crime anticipates the offense and stops the crimes before they happen.....or do they??? Would it always, always and without exception, have played out as anticipated? Tom Cruise, framed and put in a position where he'll have an irresistible urge to kill, is told by the PreCog that he can still choose and begins to wonder. A frightening vision of a possible future, and great entertainment. Highly recommend.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|Alfonso Cuaron has outdone Chris Columbus with this movie. It's suspenseful, funny, and adventurous. I enjoyed it very much. In fact, I saw it three times. The actors and actresses have shown a tremendous amount of effort and patience with this movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|On Septmeber 11th 2001, the world changed forever. This film is not an account of what happened on that terrible day in history, but the shock waves it made, which today still can be felt. If you have read either Dude Wheres My Country or Stupid White Men you would have felt like you have seen this film, as it is just both books made into a film really. The film starts with the 2000 elections in the apparent 'Most Democratic Country in the World' where Bush lost the vote but still became president. The moment where citizens of Florida ask for it to be put right but cannot get a single signature from the Senate, just filled me with anger, how can the people of america allowed Bush to wim, it disgusts me still.  <br /> <br />The rest of the film is really what a job Bush has done, making America the least respected country in the world. I should know, I am british and live in the UK, and me my friends, my parents, my grandparents and on all TV programs mock President Warlord Bush. If Bush is dum, how dum is america to elect him? <br /> <br />The facts presented in the film are true, however they are biast so we only hear Moore's side of the argument. The film made me laugh at moments like Bush's one liners and the equipment to help yourself in a terroist attacks. Moments of the film are alos heart breaking, like the mothor of a child who was killed in Iraq over a qar over oil.  <br /> <br />Overall I thought this was an excellent film, better then  Bowling for Columbine. Although this will do very little to the election in my eyes, as Bush supporters will not watch it (maybe in guilt), but hopefully it will swing some floating voters to the Kerry camp. one final thing \\"Come on KERRY\\"
B00005R5G9|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE ABOUT ANDREW MCCARTHY FALLING IN LOVE WITH EMMY. EMMY WAS SUPPOSED TO MARRY CHIS COLUMBUS BUT HAD AN ACCIDENT DURING THE ANCIENT TIMES AND ENDED UP BEING A MANNEQUIN. ANDREW MCCARTHY GETS A JOB AT A DEPARTMENT STORE WORKING AT NIGHT AND A MANNEQUIN COMES ALIVE BEFORE HIS EYES AND HE WOULD BE THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD SEE OR TALK TO HER. BUT IN THE END SHE BECOMES  ALIVE AND THEY END UP GETTING MARRIED. <br /> <br />WHAT A GREAT LOVE STORY!!!!!!  THIS MOVIE KIND OF MAKES YOU THINK IF OTHER MANNEQUINS COME ALIVE.(JUST KIDDING)!!!
B0000639FE|5.0|Unless you want to update your VCR tapes, the DVD \\"special addition\\" really isn't worth the extra $. Doesn't really add anything to the original movie unless you think DVD really adds that much to the visual quality. Still, I give this one five stars because it's a terrific movie. Jerry finds a conscience, loses his job, starts his own company and nearly loses that, finds love and loses that...then gets it everything back and ends up with all the marbles. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s great \\"SHOW ME THE MONEY!\\" scene is almost worth the price of the flick alone, and so is the now-classic lover's line \\"You had me at hello.\\"  Tom Cruise, always underappreciated by the Hollywood establishment, once again had a fabulous performance overlooked here. Watch for cameos by Troy Aikman and Katarina Witt near the end.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I hated it from the beginning to the end.  The plot was too predictable with very little surprises.  The lines were weak and uninspiring.  You come to a point where you literally want to see Jesus die so that the suffering would end for the viewer. Talk about flogging a theme, this one wins, palms down!      Again I got caught up with the hype and controversy, regarding this film.  I made a promise to myself that this would be the last film that I shall purchase, before I see it first, so help me God!
B0001MDP3G|2.0|An explosion, and it's not that great, at the beginning of the film is its high point. Then a soldier deserts to return to his sweetheart, and from there on it's a series of vignettes about the events - ranging from morbidly depressing to terribly morbid - that befall the characters. One begins to feel that perhaps life might be more pleasant on the battlefields than off, which probably wasn't the intended message.       <br /> <br />The film's biggest problem is its construction of disjointed scenes. Each time we return to the characters they've moved on from where we previously left them and are doing something else, which removes any chance of emotional concern. There's little to care about anywhere. On the surface it's a love story but we see so little chemistry and interaction between the two people that it comes off less like a love story and more like a compulsion of some kind. If they were real life people I'd suggest counseling.     <br /> <br />The writing is terrible, the characters can't wait to tell us as quickly as possible that they're stereotypes formed from the scraps of older stories. Ava is a refined Southern belle incapable of looking after herself; a Scarlet without the attitude. Ruby is a feisty broad with a heart of gold, the no-nonsense gal pal every insipid heroine needs. Ava's father is a hearty old Southern gentleman, a la Colonel Saunders, and so forth.  <br /> <br />None of them are especially likeable, but that they come across as ridiculous is worse. Nicole Kidman's character seems to demonstrate nothing more than the importance of always being fashionably dressed and well-groomed, even while doing farm labor and starving. I've never cared for Renee Zellweger's acting and her completely over the top `gimme my DAYM OSCAH!!!' speeches drove me nuts - whatever happened to being able to express emotion subtly as a requirement in acting? - although I will admit they did add some life to the whole dreary thing. Jude Law comes off the best, mostly he's fleeing from one god-awful situation after another and doesn't have as much time to make a fool of himself.  <br /> <br />I'd rather enlist in the Confederate Army than sit through this thing again.
B000059XUT|5.0|I LIKED THIS CARTOON IT WAS PRETY GOOD. MY NIECE HAS THIS MOVIE AND I HAD WATCHED IT WITH HER WHEN IT WAS RELEASED ON VIDEO. I LIKED WOODY AND BUZZ LIGHTYEAR. THIS WAS A GOOD CARTOON ADVENTURE. IF YO LIKE WALT DISNEY ENTERTAINMENT THEN THEREFORE I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY THIS VIDEO BECAUSE YOU WOULD ENJOY IT.
B0001US8EO|2.0|This movie is entertaining, but not as good as \\"Tombstone\\" which was released about the same time. Kostner's Earp comes off somewhat flat and the script, while giving a hard, authentic look at life in the wild west, lacks the snap of \\"Tombstone.\\" Recommend it instead for the better casting (especially Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday and Sam Elliott)
1557280290|3.0|First published in 1965, STONER is one of those books that has stayed around for years based on an underground reputation.  William Stoner, a farmer's son in the Midwest, travels by foot and buggy to the University where his entire career will take place.  The little things add up, an understanding mentor, a pair of young friends (one of them dies in World War I), a sadistic and seemingly homosexual rival, Lomax who, oddly enough, reminds Stoner in some ways of his dead friend David Masters.  Stoner's tragedy is marrying Edith, the spoiled daughter of a wealthy man who loses his fortune in the crash of 1929.  Here's where Williams, who died in 1994, loses me.  Edith is beyond a doubt the most horrid caricature of a woman, wife and mother ever created by any American novelist.  Did Williams, and the male novelists who continue to recommend STONER as an example of realism's quiet virtues, ever realize what precisely they are vouching for?<br /><br />It is not enough that Edith is so foul she makes Martha in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf seem like Mary Pickford.  No, it is that she is awful in so many different ways.  She's frigid; then again she's sexually passionate.  She's over- devoted to her daughter; then again we find out she really hates her.  She won't let Stoner have a moment's peace in his entire life.  I do not regard Stoner as an ordinary man with an ordinary career.  He is an illusion of patience created by a novelist with severe problems towards women.<br /><br />All in all, it is a page-turning expose of the bottom feeding of academic life, coupled with a misogyny that could have come out of the worst of modern rap lyrics.
B00007E8V4|3.0|This album is a very solid collaboration, although it falters in some respects. Heavy metal is a genre that gets discredited for being repetitious, and this album has a few songs that fit that mould. However, there are always many bright spots. &quot;Innervision&quot; is a powerful and insightful song about what it means to step forth and be yourself, your imagination is power, and without it you are powerless. &quot;Boom!&quot; The song probably most well-known on the album due to the video, is a left-wing foray against neo-capitalism. Its an extremely dark song. The other standout is &quot;Roulette&quot;, a simple riff on an acoustic guitar, about love and loss. It contrasts other SOAD songs, but not in a bad way. This song is powerful in its own right. However, its not quite a complete album. It just doesn't seem like there's a theme, but then again it wasn't recorded in one run.
0790732203|5.0|I LIKE THIS MOVIE THIS IS A MUST HAVE MOVIE WITH TOM CRUISE I LOVE THIS MOVIE THIS SHOWS YOUNG TOM CRUISE TAKING CARE OF HIS PARENTS HOUSE WHILE THEY ARE AWAY AND HE LEARNS HOW TO MAKE MONEY THE OLD FASHIONED WAY AND HAS TO BE SURE TO PUT HIS MOM'S PLACE BACK INTO SHAPE BEFORE THEY RETURN THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY TOM CRUISE FAN.
B00008IHN1|5.0|Fans of Drum Corps International, especially, will find this entertaining. The choreography is exceptional and the whole band is great, although the focus is of course on the drum line. A&T University must form an unbeatable unit out of individual egos to beat their rival school, and the result is a fine film that will appeal to adults as well as young people. The cast is likeable and the music is great. Amazing what someone can do with a pair of sticks. Highly recommend.
B0002S94OS|3.0|When I first heard 'Laid To Rest', the first thing that popped into my head was \\"Well... this sounds like Lamb Of God.\\" The first time I sat down and listened to the whole album, I thought more of the same... 'Ashes Of The Wake' sounds like Lamb Of God. Actually, it sounds like a band that wanted to make an album exactly like 'As The Palaces Burn', and in that respect the album is a total success, and a powerful work. The 'see who gives a f*ck!' part of 'Laid To Rest' is one of the toughest breakdowns I've heard in years, and there are at least 5 or 6 riffs on the first half of the album that I'd put with Lamb Of God's best.    But, while most reviewers have been commenting on the 'better' production, I can't help but feel that there's something huge missing from this album. And that huge thing's name is Devin Townsend. Lamb Of God is a tight, technical, grooving ball of fire, but on 'As The Palaces Burn', Devin kept that flame in check while carefully adding more fuel at the right times. Remember the first time you heard the breakdown in '11th Hour'? I'm sure, like me, you were left jaw-on-floor, reeling from the sheer brutality of those few seconds. By the end of track 4, I worshiped Lamb Of God. That's exactly what is lacking from the new album... every riff is powerful, every groove is funky, every breakdown tight, but there's just no point on the entire album where you go \\"Wow, what the hell was that??\\"     I guess that's what I was saying in the first place... every song on 'As The Palaces Burn' was immediately memorable and quite original, but while the songwriting quality of 'Ashes Of The Wake' is totally on-par, it offers absolutely nothing new.     My advice, members of Lamb Of God, is to ring up the Skullet, beg forgiveness for whatever kept him from sitting behind the board this time around, and get back to us in 2006 with something that's really relevant.
B00004SU5J|4.0|St. Germain effortlessly fuses acid jazz with electronic overtones, while also adding some dub and hip hop-influenced beats as well as some subtle blues guitar into the mix. I picked up this cd while in Paris and was glad I stumbled on to such an artist. Highly recommended.

Proving that family can be so embarrassing, lowlife in-law Randy Quaid shows up with the not-so-near-and-dear to spend Christmas, the senile aunt..they're all there, including the rabid squirrel in the Christmas tree. This is entertainment for everyone, especially those of us who want to see the holidays depicted as they really are, not like in \\"A Christmas Carol.\\"
B0000634EV|5.0|Down is a bad ass group of Beer drinkin,pot smokin,long haired,tatooed rednecks that make kick ass music.We got Phil Anselmo(Pantera),Kirk Weinstein(Crowbar),Pepper Keenan(Corrosion Of Conformity)Rex Brown(Pantera),and Jimmy Bower(EyeHateGod)Well theres enough sweat,booze,and reefer referance in this album to even make God himself feel nasty.This band hopefully will continue on with makin music because they kick ass.Stain Glass Cross,Ghost Along The Mississippi,The Seed,and New Orleans is a Dying Whore are all great songs to dring and smoke your ass of to.But my personal favorite is Learn From My Mistake it's a power-ballad and it just flat out kicks ass.Phil's voice sounds so clear and you can feel the regret pouring out of his soul and into the mic.Thers a great ,make that 2 great solo's by Weinstein and Keenan the cd is great if you like any of the members other bands then give Down a try.

Bleach was Nirvana's debut album, not In Utero. Also, Puddle Of Crap, I mean Mudd, weren't even around in the 90's, so your precious Pile Of Crap...er...Puddle Of Mudd, are ones doing the ripping off. Nirvana is the reason for that bad excuse for a band Puddle Of Mudd. Nevermind came out before Come Clean, so get your facts straight you moron.This is one, if not the best band EVER!

B0000CDL93|2.0|Except for some fine performances, this examination into the Kennedy Assassination really doesn't tell us anything new or different. It's hard to be entertained or informed by a movie that simply presents the facts everyone has heard a hundred times. Not even good as a documentary because it's been Hollywoodized. If you like Oliver Stone, watch \\"Platoon\\" instead because it's a much better film.
B0000YEEGM|5.0|I LIKE THIS MOVIE THIS MOVIE SHOWS TOM HANKS MORE DRAMATIC SIDE AND I LIKE HIS WORK.
6305252521|2.0|I didn't find this the least bit funny, especially after Princess Diana's tragic death. The media does hound people to death, and it ain't an ingredient for fun, folks. The callousness of the Truman Show's \\"cast\\" is appalling - (...) - and Truman's \\"something isn't right here\\" is endlessly dragged out. The ending is especially unsatisfying - what does Truman do next, do these jerks get away with what they did, does he have a \\"normal\\" life after this, are all left unanswered. Waaay to long as well. At least twenty minutes of this flick could and should have been left on the cutting room floor. Instead of feeling entertained when it's over, the viewer feels like one of the voyeurs who exploited Truman. Jim Carrey fans should rent \\"Ace Ventura\\" instead.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE W/ SHELLY LONG AND TOM HANKS. <br />BUY A HOUSE REALLY A LEMON AND IT BECOMES APART EVERY PLACE THEY GO AND EVERY STEP THAT THEY TAKE THIS MOVIE IS JUST FUNNY PLAIN AND SIMPLE. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF TOM HANKS' COMEDY THEN YOU WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE THIS MOVIE.
B00005JK8K|5.0|The contributions of the Navajo codetalkers have been ignored for far too long, and this movie gives an accurate picture of their heroism and their unique gift to American defense in World War II. The fact that racism made their service to their country even less appreciated makes this film all the more poignant to the viewer. Worth watching for the history, the patriotism, and fine entertainment. WOnderful to see this recognition of the Navajos, even in a Hollywoodized movie.

B00005JNEI|1.0|Micheal Moore's alternate reality would have been fine if it would have been categorized as fiction. As it were, Moore uses a twisted premise (Bush is evil and he is worse than any terrorist) and takes the audience through his \\"logic\\" in hopes of having them arrive at the same conclusion. The problem with this movie that it leaves out too many fact to justify Moore's rediculous conjecture.  <br /> <br />Although he tries to convice us that we went to Afghanistan for an oil pipeline, he fails to see that after all this time, there is STILL NO PIPELINE and there are no plans to build one.  <br /> <br />His Halliburton conspiracyare also overdone. It's true that Halliburton was given a no-bid contract to help with oil operations in Iraq, but Bill Clinton gave Halliburton an identical no-bid contract to go into Bosnia and rebuilt the oil infrastructure there.  <br /> <br />He tries to connect the Bushes with the bin Ladens by showing that members of both families have investments in the Carlyle group. Once again, his attempt at logic falls short. In fact, one of the largest investors in the Carlyle group is George Soros, who is one of the major backers of MoveOn.Org, an avowed enemy of the Bush administration. <br /> <br />All in all, Moore's attempt to convince us that Bush is evil just comes off as too emotional and not cerebral enough. <br /> <br />

B00005OC06|5.0|Perhaps the most authoritative voice (in English at least) The Penguin Guide to Recordings of Classical Music judges Herbert von Karajan \\"second to none\\" as an interpreter of Puccini. However with an opera like Madama Butterfly that focuses on one character the lead singer must assume prime importance. Mirella Freni has recorded this opera three times and it is no coincidence that The Penguin Guide crowns her recordings as the three best. \\"Sweeter of voice than any on record\\" (their words), Freni effloresces as Butterfly, bringing into bloom her rich bouquet of tonal colors to flush the role to life with compelling urgency while \\"consistently growing in stature from the young girl to the tragic heroine.\\" In uncharacteristic harmony, The Gramophone agrees that Freni is indeed the finest Butterfly while Fred Plotkin, former director of New York's Metropolitan Opera, in his book, \\"Opera 101\\", takes a step further and adorns her \\"almost unrivaled\\" in the sphere of Romantic Italian opera.    <br />     Following its disastrous opening Puccini withdrew Madama Butterfly from performance and, along with the librettists, set to work on it for three months. The decision to mitigate the villainy of Pinkerton and invest him with some redeeming qualities proved pivotal for without such improvement the dynamic degenerates into  melodrama and Butterfly lapses into a silly young woman who closes her eyes to reality and gets crushed by it. Pinkerton--though careless (hence the chewing gum, t-shirt, tossing the Ottoke, the mutinous collar, etc.), irresponsible, and callously ethnocentric--is never consciously evil and the distinction becomes crucial to establishing Butterfly as a tragic heroine. Neither blind nor stupid, she retains a vision of humanity (based on the kind of person she is) that is nobler and finer than what we actually are and this is her hamartia (tragic flaw). Ponelle illuminates this for us by positioning his camera at ground level looking up so she emerges as a towering, heroic figure braced against the sky as she clenches her fists, throws her head back, and sings with passionate puissance, \\"Tutto questo avverr, te lo prometto. Tienti la tua paura, io con sicura fede l'aspetto.\\" (All this will happen I promise you. Keep your fears to yourself, I shall await him with unshakeable faith.) <br />     The most enchanting voice ever to record the role of Butterfly, the most august baton of the second half of the twentieth century supported by two of its most beloved legends (Domingo and Ludwig), all captured working in concert to grace us with Puccini's opus magnum--for the true aficionado this is opera paradise. My fellow reviewers besmirch the page with whining over lip-synching, video quality, camera angles, the distension of Domingo's epigastrium, and (of all the inane twaddle) the alignment of Freni's incisors. Excuse me, but what does any of this have to do with music? Silence, ye film critics! This is the ethereal art of opera, not mere cinema.  <br />     One caveat: claims to the contrary notwithstanding, the Brazilian release offers no English subtitles.   <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was a show that presented deep characters in interesting situations.  The characters, aside from being very well developed, form a unique collection who are only thrown together by the strangest of situations.  This is really unlike any other TV series I've ever seen- and much better.  I liked this show when it was on TV, but being able to see the shows in their proper order, I now REALLY love this show and am eagerly awaiting the movie.

It's a must-have!  What more can I say?  I'm ordering it on cd TODAY.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|95% of the people reviewing this movie are either drooling over it to put themselves above the fray or bashing it to put themselves above the fray. Ignore those people. <br /> <br />Donnie Darko is a movie about the alienating and contradictory forces that act upon people in our modern world. Though many would write it off as a teen angst movie because the protagonist is a high school student, the movie shows that the same forces which alienate teenagers are acting on the adults and authority figures as well. That said, many of the people giving this movie five-star ratings are not worth listening to either. Here's the deal: <br /> <br />Excellent plot, acting, cinematography, dialogue, and musical score. <br /> <br />That's all I had to say. I figured this movie could use an endorsement from somebody who isn't crusading against \\"hollywood crap\\" or bashing this movie as \\"pretentious teen drama.\\" I like movies, and I like this movie.
B00028HBKM|5.0|My review will not be nearly as sophisticated as some of the ones ive seen here. I will just say that as a lover of the epics i have seen most if not all of the movies dealing with the Passion. This one is the best by far in depicting the violent times in which this occured. I too have seen many Fulci and Argento movies which are very brutal in their own right, this one affected me much more due to the fact that whether you believe or not this is the type of torture Jesus, and many others endured in those times. 5 Stars for Mr. Gibson's masterpiece and 5 for the DVD quality.
B00003CXCT|5.0|No Jar Jar Binks ... and no non-talent actors like Hayden Christensen to foul up a movie... what more could I say? We do have the Ewoks in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" but nothing beats \\"Star Wars\\" & \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" in this trilogy. Can't wait til' they come out. I used to own the VHS tapes and the Laserdiscs.. I have to buy the DVDs! When I first bought my DVD player many years ago I was disappointed to learn that Star Wars was not out on DVD... and hopefully it will be worth the wait and something of the highest quality. Anyone who stood in line at the theaters for hours back in the late seventies and early eighties understand the greatness of these movies. <br />
0790732025|5.0|wow this movie took my breath away. They really got Henri Charriere's life down hard in this (only a couple of changes but not bad ones) some of the scenes were very hard to take in some ways, you can really tell just by seeing some of what they did to him, that it wasn't easy. The relationship between Dega and Papi was very good. It really brought out the bonding they had and everything they went through together. The ending was very touching as well.   <br /> <br />Steve McQueen was once again exeptional. Even though, he was protrayed as a cool tough guy as he usually is in all of his films, this movie showed more then that. In some scenes he really brought out the character. As a rough tough human being to a very emotional tortured person. it was just shocking how he managed to take your breath away with a twinkle in those stunning blue eyes. This movie is the movie that really made me fall head over heels with this guy. It's a shame that he didn't get and oscar nomination for this. He derseves it!   <br /> <br />Dustin Hoffman did an extrememly good job on this character. (one of the best actors of all times)playing Papillon's scruffy, scrawny friend who went to prison for fake bank bonds. He made the character very believable especially at the end <br /> <br />I would have to say this is the most amazing movie i have seen in a long time. From beginning to the end it just took my breath away. Even though it is long, the time goes by really fast, and it is worth seeing
B00007AJF9|5.0|Elizabeth tells of the coming of age Queen of England who had to rule the country in the midst of assassination attempts and plots on herself by her power hungry court, and people who think women shouldn't be on the throne. It may not be history in all it's accurate details, but it's an intriguing tale filled with conspiracy.  <br /> <br />Cate Blanchett portrays Elizabeth from naive princess to Queen of England with such remarkable talent that watching this movie once isn't enough. Excellent acting on the part of the rest of the cast and kudos to the director who did an amazing job of the movie! <br /> <br />Therefore, this movie should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards instead of Shakespeare In Love. Cate Blanchett should have won Best Actress that year too instead of Gwyneth Paltrow. All in favour for a change, raise your hands, no? But you will change your mind after you've watched it, I personally guarantee it!
B000005RMY|3.0|this isn't a review so moch as a gloat.  Like I said, \\"had it, lost it, don't care.\\"  I still have all the SOM 7\\" & Ep's (and a turn table to play them on!).  To bad you kiddlies weren't there to see them Live!<br /><br />1
0767805712|5.0|A movie that touched my heart. The line towards the end of the movie that Jude Law's character reads, \\"You lent me your dreams\\" I thought pretty much sums it up.  <br /> <br />In life, if you work hard enough, mix with a little bit of \\"cheating\\" to outwit the system, you'll get what you want. That's the basis of this movie, but not how the actors portrayed it. They did a remarkable job about how an unknown could make it in the big world, with help from friends, and still find a girlfriend! The human spirit really endures and perseveres here. <br /> <br />That, and it's an Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law movie, who better actors can you ask for?
B00008EY65|4.0|I came to this movie having no idea of the comic book character and damn if it wasn't a great movie with a lot emotional impact.  Yeah, it's a movie about a demon who fights against other demonic beings, but at its heart it is also a story of the love between a father and son.  Ron Perlman as Hellboy is simply fantastic.  I've been a fan of Mr. Perlman since his days on \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\"  I see a lot of the emotion he showed as Vincent in this movie.  All of the actors are great with Selma Blair and John Hurt chief among them. Hellboy is not your usual summer movie fare.
0780622553|4.0|This movie is Sci-Fi at it's best story-telling. The buildup of the story was most interesting, it had the who is he? what's going on? what's going to happen? driving force.  <br /> <br />Great acting on the part of the, at that time little known, stellar cast. Jennifer Connolly, as usual, does a fantastic job as supporting actress in this movie. William Hurt in his younger, not so balding self, and Rufus Sewell seems to do better in Sci-Fi movies then in other types of movies like Extreme Ops and A Knight's Tale. Director Alex Proyas went on to direct I, Robot, which also turned out to be a great hit!  <br /> <br />This movie will always be the original Matrix without it's confusing sequels. Hopefully directors read this review and understand that making a movie shouldn't rely on sequels, one shot movies drive the point across and make it an instant classic along the lines of Blade Runner, in it's own way. <br /> <br />A highly recommended love story. Enjoy!
B00028FDRA|5.0|John, if you haven't gotten the album, why review it?<br />Back to the album, IT F***ING ROCKS SO F***ING HARD!! This is my favorite CD EVER!!!!! Also, I saw an acoustic show last week, and they were signing autographs. When I got my stuff signed, I almost had a heart attack. I also got to shack each members' hand. When I shook Cristina's hand, I thoguht to myself \\"I'm NEVER washing this hand again!\\" Anyone who writes a negative review for ANY of their albums should have their ba  s torn off and be force-fed them. This album MUST be in your collection. Well, WTF are you waiting for? Quit reading the review and buy it!!!!!
B00006RCNJ|5.0|I thought this DVD was terrific and exciting!  It was &#34;Live at the Royal Alber Hall&#34; DVD that first introduced me to Rieu, and from there I bought several more of his DVDs.  It would be a dream come true to physically attend a live concert, and someday I hope to do that.<br /><br />If you are one who thinks classical is boring, think again!  This DVD will put a step in your toes, and when it's all over, you'll feel like you've really partied! (Without the effects of a hangover..)<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was finally able to attend one of his live concerts when he was here in the USA on tour!  Awesome!  My positive review still stands.  :)
B00000JPH6|5.0|This is a wonderful movie about a being who is aiming to restore a crystal to it's whole state before an evil race can gain eternal control over the stars of the universe when the 'three suns' converge. The landscapes are amazing. The overall movie tone is really sweet and enchanting. A somewhat overlooked classic it is.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Well, my family and I rented this film over the summer, and I've got to say I can clearly understand why the film was so highly praised. Let me start with the plot.  <br /> <br />The plot of the story didn't have holes in it (except for why Bourne was trying to kill Wombozi. We all were a bit confused by that part). It was a good blend of action and suspense, which I like in the film. Perhaps one day I'll read the book this film was based on. I'll be looking forward for the Bourne Supremacy on DVD (I'm the kind of person who likes to wait for a film to come out on DVD unless I really want to see it in theatres). It was even comical sometimes, especially around the ending fight between Bourne and Conklin's agents.  <br /> <br />The acting was well-done. Matt Damon is superb as Jason Bourne; he delivers an awesome performance that really tells you what kind of character he is. Clive Owen does a good job as the Professor; he did really well in the sniping scene. And Chris Cooper as Conklin...you gotta love this guy. Outstanding work, Mr. Cooper. It's a shame that Conklin won't be in the next film...I wanted to see more of that guy. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Get this film if you're into action and suspense. <br />
0783225849|5.0|Psycho is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is very scary and thrilling. And the remake is good to, don't let all those 1 star reviews put you down. I recomend to buy the special edition dvd.
0920668372|5.0|There is just one thing that I have to say about this book. If every mother truly felt and behaved in the same way as the mother in this story, the world would never have any Jeffery Dahmer's or John Wayne Gacy's. As a psychotherapist, I must agree with the research that supports the notion that \\"Mother\\" is a significant figure in the development of a child's personality. It is the lack of this type of unconditional love that can create adult emotional and mental disturbances. Every mother and mother-to-be needs to own a copy of this book; And every female needs to read and think about the true meaning of this story before making the decision to have children!!!      Every word of this story describes my feelings towards my computer \\"whiz\\" kid son, Eagle Scout, Alvin Joseph Michael Reed!!!
B000096IBI|5.0|Five stars isn't enough for this film which is a deserved classic, one of the great movies ever made. If you've never seen a Chaplin film, \\"Modern Times\\" is the one to sample first: it's more accessible than Charlie's silent movies and the plot, theme, acting, music and ambiance of the movie is superb in every way. It would be hard not to adore this movie, it has everything in it.<br /><br />What can you say about Chaplin that hasn't already been said? He was a genius of the highest realm. He wrote, directed, composed the music and starred in \\"Modern Times\\" and his inimitable charisma surrounds the entire production. I've seen this movie 30 times and never get weary of it, there's always something new to notice or appreciate. The way Charlie moves his body is always a joy to behold. My favorite scene is towards the end of the film when the Tramp finally speaks on film, albeit in gibberish, in his famous \\"Nonsese Song.\\" Note that there is no doubt Michael Jackson completely ripped off Charlie with his \\"moonwalk\\" dance, which he lefts almost entirely from Charlie's dance preceding the \\"Nonsense Song.\\" Indeed, Chaplin's gifts as a compsoser are in full force here, the music is beautiful throughout.<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" has it all: laughter, tears, pathos, as well as a social message 50 years ahead of its time. Modern industry dulls the human spirit and imprisons the soul, making workers lose their individuality and humanity. Charlie points this out in comedic ways, as well as more serious undertones.<br /><br />Paulette Goddard, Charlie's third wife (we think, their marriage certificate has never surfaced), is excellent in the supporting role of the homeless gamin. Her beauty is exceptional. Even with minimal make-up anda  simple hairdo, she is stunningly gorgeous. Charlie always had good taste in judging women's beauty and Paulette is no exception!<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" is a timeless cinematic masterpiece. Cherish your initial viewing, you'll never forget its impact as you laugh, cry and reflect on the genius of Charles Chaplin. My highest recommendation.impact as you laugh, cry and reflect on the genius of Charles Chaplin. My highest recommendation.
0767821769|4.0|'Stepmom' takes on an emotional journey through the lives of 5 people, 3 adults and 2 children.  Though I found this movie moving, emotional and at times fun, it lacks in truth.  Considering I've been through a divorce with my parents and my father remarried, I know how it is, somewhat.  I know it isn't the same for everyone but I get the jist of it.  As always, Susan Sarandon is infectious (no pun intended), she's one of the most brilliant actresses alive, maybe ever.  Julia Roberts is tough and upfront while Ed Harris shows an emotional, quieter character who doesn't have as much film time as he should. <br />The two children, Sarandon's and Harris' children are played extremely well.  For their ages, they act similar to what would happen.  The younger boy doesn't feel much different except asks 'mommy, if you want me to hate her [meaning Julia Roberts], I will' - typical for a young boy to side with his mother but also not be angry at the other woman in his fathers life only because he doesn't quite understand yet.  The daughter however is like pin point.  She's angry and doesn't seem to give Isabelle [Roberts] a chance.  When Isabelle brings home a puppy to try and win her love, she exclaims she's allergic to dogs but is actually lying.  She doesn't want Isabelle to think she is giving her any part of her.  She \\"hates\\" her.  The movie is mainly focused on how Anna hates Isabelle and how they bond.  The unrealistic part is how Roberts character and Sarandon's character coexist towards the end.  I'm not saying it could never happen but it's a little over the top.  In all, this is a good family film, a good movie for people going through that type of situation, I somewhat wished I had seen it before or while I was going through the same thing.
0440241413|5.0|This book was great. I found it hard to put down; I would start reading a page and by the time I would look up, I would realize I made my way through four or five chapters. I considered myself to be a shopaholic, but now I feel less guilty for it because I've never found myself in debt because of my bad habit. It's funny, has a little romance and some seriousness to it. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys to spend money for the sake of spending money.
B00028HBKC|1.0|Historically inaccurate and boring. It only depicts graphic scenes of Christ's crucification and nothing else. It lacks depth and pretty much everything else. Don't waste your time or money buying this.
B000088E6D|5.0|I love this album and so must millions of other listeners. Buble' has magical tones that seduce you no matter how often you listen. <br />\\"HOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART?\\" with background vocals of none other than B. Gibbs of the Bee Gees has to be the most beautiful remake of a song that I've ever heard. <br />Sway, Moondance, Kissing a Fool, Put your head on my Shoulders - the list goes on of beautifully orchestrated and arranged songs that Buble's magical tones caress. NUMBER ONE WITH ME!

B00003CXA6|4.0|Having watched Gettysburg four times and then having gone back and reread Michael Shaara's book, I have come to the conclusion that Maxwell has done an honorable job of translating Shaara's book to film.  However, Martin Sheen's portrail of Robert E Lee is so poorly done that it seriously detracts from the overall satisfaction of the movie. <br />  Lee was a deeply religious man.  He was very open about his faith in God and considered it to be the central anchor of his life.  Martin Sheen seems to think that if he was religious, that must mean that General Lee had an ethereal look in his eyes and stared off into space a lot.  There are scenes where Sheen's General Lee looks like he is trying to hear voices that are telling him where he left his lunch.  It was very distracting and diminished the enjoyment of the movie considerably. <br />  General Lee's horse, Traveler, was by all accounts a magnificent animal.  I suspect that Martin Sheen is not very comfortable around horses because the animal in the movie can't be much bigger than a shetland pony.  There is a scene toward the end of the movie, just before the disasterous Rebel charge up Cemetary Ridge, where Sheen is riding Traveler in front of the cheering soldiers.  He looks less like a great general and more like an uncomfortable dude whose head bounces like a bobblehead doll. <br />  Had this portrail not been so bad, I would gladly have give the movie five stars.  The scenes of Chamberland and the 20th Maine on Little Round Top are inspiring.  The portrail of the first and second day buildup to the battle and Pickett's charge are well done and follow Shaara's book faithfully enough.  At nearly four hours, the movie is long, but this really didn't bother me, so was the actual battle, after all. <br />  I can easily recommend the movie to others, I only wish that Sheen had had a better insight into his portrail of Lee.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|I love art rock. I love Alan Parsons. I Robot, Pyramid, Try Anything Once, Time Machine, they were all brilliant albums. But now PARSONS HAS SOLD OUT TO THE \\"CLUB MTV\\" GENERATION! Here you will find not one scrap of the depth and tunefullness of the previous albums, just simple-minded kiddie schlock played with the subtlety of a jack hammer! Every song (if these can be called songs) sounds like a clone of all the worst MTV-approved groups. Babies goo goo-ing? Computer gurgles? Distorted voices? Plastic sounding drum machines? IS THIS A JOKE, MR. PARSONS? This is an obvious SELL OUT and a kick in the teeth to all of the fans who have stayed faithful over the years. I'm afraid that I will never again but an Alan Parsons album without sampling it first. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
B00008S2VG|5.0|So, I've heard so much trashy, hypocrits,tacky and tasteless people talking about this Madonna album, American Life and it is time for me to tell you how I feel. This is Madonna's best album since her 1998 Ray of light. The only reason why many (but still who are they?)considered it a flop is because of jealousy or hipocrisy. The jealousy is caused by an artist who has a career that most of the pop singers out there will never have. The hipocrisy is that of those Americans who still think that U.S.A. is the best country in the world. Well go to visit Florence, Italy and then think about it! Madonna once again reveals her soul, her believes, her musicality and her uncomparable talent. <br />American Life reveals so much of the actual stress America puts on your life and the obsession of \\"making it\\". Nobody knows me is a hymn to her secret(or misunderstood)personality that very few people is able to understand. Mother and Father is a introspective sad-tecno-dance tune in which she melts the neverending pain for the death of her mother and the \\"coming to terms\\" with her father, that is to say, she finally gets his dad humanity and fragility (see \\"oh father\\" on the Like A Prayer album, 1989 masterwork). Easy Ride is her searching for the self poem, a beautifully released track which brings to life Madonna's eternally, infinite, deep soul. Thank you Madonna for being who you are.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I think the movie could be a 5 star movie . But having to read everything that is said is a little bit too much you might miss some of the film . Mel Gibson I never thought you would release this in the US and not have it in a english version. I hate to have to read all of the movie .I like to just sit back and relax and enjoy the movie . It would be a very big plus to release this one in english . For those who dont like to read movies . May as well just get the book!
B000025XDU|5.0|Next to \\"Quo\\", my favorite Status Quo album.  This record always struck me as a blend between Chuck Berry & \\"Sweet Hitchhiker\\" era Creedence Clearwater; but with a cleaner, harder & more boogie-laden edge.  Rossi & Parfitt blend their guitars perfectly while Alan Lancaster's bass & John Coghlan's drums lay down an ultra-solid, foot stomping musical foundation.  If your a fan of early 70's British Rock (Slade, Foghat) this album is a definite \\"add to cart\\".  You won't regret your purchase!  ***2005 Update!  Beware of \\"remastered\\" version with bonus track.  The sound is not much better than this release and not worth the price.***
B00008NG5V|4.0|I really like this album a lot.  It's especially good if you feel like lying on your bed and daydreaming, and even better still if you happen to be in love. <br /> <br />There really isn't much else to say.  It's all good stuff--pretty, relaxing, easy on the ears--but sometimes I wish I could holler at him and tell him to get excited about something.  He does a little 'reggae' in Horizon has Been Defeated, and Rodeo Clowns manages to pick up some speed, but other than that, it's extraordinarily similair/ALL THE SAME!  Well, 'what will be, will be.' <br /> <br />Overall, if you buy it, you will like it.  As I said before, it puts one in a state of mind that's really quite nice, and it is, obviously, great for beach listening.  I've never heard Brushfire Fairytales, so I can't say if one's better than the other, but I will say that this is a solid, very enjoyable album.
B00000IQW3|5.0|\\"Greetings, Starfighter! You have been recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Kodan armada...\\"<br /><br />One of the movies I have loved when I was a kid and still love watching even now. In fact, it's the only movie I have watched a lot more than my other favorites. And I have loved it so much that until now I can still say most of the key dialogues! ha-ha!<br /><br />The main attraction of this movie is that it's a sci-fi movie that has great special effects. In fact, it is the first movie to really incorporate massive CGI (computer graphics interface) sequences.<br /><br />Most of you might say, \\"So what? It's just another sci fi movie.\\"<br /><br />Well, if you take time to watch it, then you'd agree that it's not just a sci-fi movie. It's about growing up and making important decisions that will shape one's future. It's about \\"when the opportunity comes, you must grab it with both hands, and hold on tight.\\" It's about having dreams and striving to reach them.<br /><br />The story centers on Alex Rogan, a simple suburban lad who had dreamed of getting a better life and got more than he imagined, but with dangerous risks and mind-blowing feats which only he and a very \\"gifted\\" few in the galaxy have.<br /><br />This DVD is recommended for those who appreciate good old movies with substance. Must buy for collectors and fans, and a great movie for good old fashion entertainment.
B000002LQR|5.0|This album is fantastic.  It's one of the few CDs I can just throw on and listen the whole way through without having to skip a track. <br /> <br />It's a very diverse album, with madly sexual songs like Sir Psycho Sexy and the title track; beautiful ballads like Could Have Lied and Under the Bridge; the semi-political Power of Equality and the Righteous and the Wicked; and the sheer wild energy of basically the rest of the entire, 74-minute, 17-track ablum. <br /> <br />People always have their preferences, but this is my personal favorite of theirs.  If you take my advice, buy this post haste, and love the rockin' funkiness, you should also pick up Mothers Milk and the Uplift Mofo Party Plan.  But, if you find yourself longing for some more pop-like stuff, try one of their latest albums, but NOT GREATEST HITS!  That album was really fake.   <br /> <br />To sum up: this is the best album of one of the greatest bands of all time.  Get it now.

B000000WFU|5.0|This CD is great! With my choral group I have sung many of these songs. My two favorites are Adiemus and Kayama. We have sung Adiemus for the past 2 years at our last concert of the year. Every time we practice/sing that song, I get chill bumps, Its an amazing feeling. Kayma is also incredible! Even though it is \\"out of the norm\\", I love it! If you are thinking about buying it, do, its incredible!
B0002KVUKM|2.0|This is what I was wondering as I left the theatre after spending what seemed like six hours of this loud, absurd, trite, head-ache inducing crapola.    I'm not even going to recount the plot, mostly because I'd prefer not to try and remember.  Van Helsing of course is the vampire-hunter from the novel Dracula.  Wrong, Van Helsing was a professor:  \\"who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world...  He is a philosopher and a metaphysician, and one of the most advanced scientists of his day; and he has... an absolutely open mind... for his views are as wide as his all-embracing sympathy.\\" (pg 147-8, Penguin Books, 1993).  Van Helsing is a character invented to be a vessel of both science and compassion, truly multi-faceted, inhabiting the realms of heart and mind equally.  In the novel Dracula he is the voice of misreason and reason, hard answers and soft words, and bridges the world between Victorian humanism and Gothic mysticism.    In the movie Van Helsing, he is none of these things.  He's a guy in a big hat, overcoat, boots, grisly face, kills monsters, and has no depth whatsoever.  I imagine most people will call this the film taking liberties for name-sake only, and as such, does not invite a true comparison with the original Van Helsing.  Whatever, I'm trying to defend one of the truly memorable characters in living literature.    The characters around him latch onto this atmosphere of superficiality and voila, we have movie.    You'll probably hear a lot of reviewers giving it five bloody stars, talking about how Stephen Sommers wanted to homage the classic B-movies of old; the endless Dracula movies, the Horror of Frankenstein, the Curse of the Mummies, the Ride of the Zombies, etc etc etc.  The problem with homaging these movies are that they are crap to begin with, and any homage has to find some kind of formula in them to mimic.  The only formula here, folks, is the studio's desire to make big money off of a crappy film.    So go aheadand buy the DVD.  Buy it just to see if you'll end up repeating what I was saying a few months ago.  Why do we allow the film industry to inflict these wastes of time on us?  I wouldn't have a problem with this film if it wasn't such a blatant attempt to simply make money.    Update, Sept. 10: 1 out of 4 people like the review.  Too bad, this is a movie for morons.    Update, Sept. 16: 1 out of 5 people.  Still for morons!
B000002H97|5.0|Although not as good as Master of Puppets, the Black album continues where And Justice for All left off, except this time you get to hear Jason Newstead's talented bass skills. This modifies Metallica's sound from pure speed and thrash to a more hard rock sound, creating their most creative album to date. Do yourself a favor and check out one of the most distinct albums of all time. This album proved to the mainstream media that Metallica was here to stay.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am a movie buff so my experties is in that field. However I am a huge fan of music and belive that all music deserves a listen before being judged.  Now to continue on with the review. <br /> <br />If you are expecting a pop CD get that thought out of your head, this is definatly not a pop CD.  This is however one of my favorite CDs of all times (Right after eve6 \\"Horrorscope\\", and KISS \\"the greatest hits\\").  This CD really show's off Christina's talent as a writter and a singer.  She has one of the most amazing voices I have heard in years.  really this CD is by far a great sound that any person who is willing to put aside their biases for an hour and just listen to it  will most likely appreciate it.

0345440900|3.0|I am a first-time mom of a two-month-old and a child/adolescent psychotherapist.  I'm reading all I can get my hands on because the day-to-day infant care is brand new to me. <br />In general, I don't like this book.   <br /> <br />However, I found some things in it that were helpful perspectives/observations.  The EASY routine helped ME observe a pattern and to help my little one sleep and eat more regularly--I considered that if he just ate and played, maybe he was tired, not hungry.  It's easing my mental loop-de-loops to conceptualize the day.  The body language chart is intriguing, but I haven't had time to check it out for its relevance to my baby yet.  Avoiding overstimulation is a big thing, as is avoiding overtiredness.  Of course, this is not the revelation of the century, but it's sound counsel.  That said... <br /> <br />I agree the tone is patronizing and self-aggrandizing.  She is biased against breastfeeding and puts out myths as the truth!  Examples include that breastfeeding hurts, and will continue to hurt (yes, it does in the beginning, but after the initial hump--it doesn't!), that you should schedule and time feedings instead of feed on-demand (scheduling and timing WILL inhibit your milk supply--possibly leading you to wean early).  She touts the improvements in formula and purports to be open to mothers choosing whatever method they want, but she presents only the pros of formula and the cons of breastfeeding. <br /> <br />The very idea that an infant is an independant being -- this is ridiculous!--as another therapist noted, the psychological task of infancy is to determine if people and the environment should be trusted or mistrusted.  One or the other.  Therefore, the most important task of parenthood in infancy is to form close relationship with the baby and teach him that people and the world can be trusted to meet their needs.  Yes this is a lot of work, but really!   <br /> <br />Yes, the methods will probably work.  But it will work because the baby is giving up on having his needs met.  An infant DOES have more than just physical sensations and needs.  The need to snuggle is real, the need to feel an important part of the family is real.  This book advocates training the baby to least disturb the adult world.  This is a poor fundamental lesson to this future child/adolescent/adult who believes that their needs are not worth anything.  This ensures my clientele for the rest of time! <br /> <br />Thank you for ensuring my future employment as a psychotherapist, Ms. Hogg, (and, granted, for a few good observations)
B000092Q4U|4.0|Lamb of God's As the Palaces Burn is an excellent example of a relatively young metal band getting out there and doing some damage. Heavy riffs, pummeling drums, and growling vocals abound on this very good record. The music is extremely heavy but does not venture into the realm of just chaotic noise, and the vocals can be rough but are unique and not as harsh as many of the metal vocalists out there (if you don't like cookie monster type metal vocalists as I don't, you still may like this; check out the samples). The only problem I have with the album is that it can seem repetitive. Many of the songs sound the same, and as mentioned by previous reviewers, the tempo rarely changes. That being said, this is still an excellent album that metal fans will surely enjoy. Check it out. I look forward to the new Lamb of God album.

And no matter how many times she intends to try to eliminate ; it's useless . Light employement of Kurosawa is overwhelming to emphasize it .<br /><br />It is very embarrasing to describe this superb and magnificent masterpiece . Kurosawa made one of his landmarks films with this ravishing and incandescent adaptation ; brilliant in superlative degree , visually outstanding and emotionally powerful movie .<br /><br />One of the supreme masters of the cinema : Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998)
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is a beautiful album, melodic and moving, funny and amusing.  This is so much better than their previous album, the irritating Soft Bulletin, its not funny. The songs are more fully realized, the melodies and arrangements far more moving/interesting and the vocals FAR less irritating (they're quite good in fact) than on the Soft Bullentin.  This is really a very good pop album that really stands alone when compared to what else is being made these days.  The Lips are in a class by themselves.  Yoshimi is the best album they've made since going electronic and traded snideness for whimsy.
B00028HBKM|2.0|One thing I want to say first off:  THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR KIDS!   <br /> <br />When I went to see this film, I was shocked to find that there were many young children in the audience.  I don't care what your minister says, allowing anyone under thirteen years of age to see this film is WRONG.  It's an incredibly brutal and violent film and there are many alternatives if you want young people to see a movie about the crucifixion of Christ.  I know that kids these days get exposed to lots of violent movies, TV shows and video games, but if you're even thinking of letting your child see this watch it first by yourself, then decide. <br /> <br />Now that I have that over with, on with the review of the DVD.  Mel Gibson made a technically brilliant film, from the costumes, sets, languages and the like, but he didn't take a great deal of risks with this movie.  The film is beautifully shot, but the characters take a back seat to the unrelenting violence.  The depiction of Satan is particularly one dimensional, with virtually no interaction with Jesus except for a brief exchange relatively early in the film.  The rest of the time, the devil skulks around looking very creepy and sinister, but ultimately comes off as a spooky but ineffectual piece of background. <br /> <br />A comparison begs to be made to \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\".  In that movie, Satan tempts Jesus by showing him just what he's giving up by allowing himself to be crucified for the sins of humanity - the love of a woman, a family, in essence giving up the chance at a normal life.  You realize the gravity and scope of that sacrifice and are compelled to admire the choice he made. <br /> <br />In contrast, all you get with Gibson's film is a portrayal of the betrayal and subsequent slow, brutal murder of a human being.  The relatively accurate glimpse of life two thousand years ago is a bonus, but I feel that Mel could've made this much more than it ended up being.  It shocked me, but it didn't go muchdeeper than that.   <br /> <br />Considering the subject of the film, that's pretty sad.
B00005YW4H|5.0|In 2002, Norah Jones won 5 Grammys for    Record of the Year (Don't Know Why)    Album of the Year (Come Away With Me)    Best New Artist    Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (Don't Know Why)    Best Pop Vocal Album (Come Away With Me)  She rightfully earned each award.  Her music is inspirational, and is an amazing collaboration of pop vocals with a jazzy flavor which is related to the folk music in the 60s.  I say related because it is really something you need to hear for yourself.  Norah's voice is seductive, sultry and exquisite.  Her words are real and I can to relate to them.  I love all of her songs:  My favs are \\"I Have to See You Again\\", \\"Don't Know Why\\",  \\"Lonestar\\", & \\"Feeling the Same Way\\"
B000007T1M|5.0|I'm not going to say that this is my favorite ablum because It's not that. I'm not going to say that this album is the best ever because It's not that, and I'm not going to say this is SOAD best ever because this band is in no way down and out and I know they can do a hell of alot better than the albums they have out now. But what I will say is that this album is grand. I loved it from the first time I ripped off that plastic safety seal when I bought it from my local shoppette( for those who do not know, that is the army equivalent of a corner store) I had never heard of them, not even MTV had ushered me into the SOAD culture, in which most SOAD fans were. Instead I give credit to my buddy Tyler who had met them when they were touring just to make a living out of their young band. So thanks, army dude :) <br /> <br />But anyways, If you love this band and you have not gotten your hands on this album, please do so after reading this. I do not suggest that you start out with Toxicity, instead go back to where it all began, with the self titled. You will not go wrong with this album. Tracks to keep your ear glued to are: <br /> <br />Spiders - Haunting, melodic tones, Serj's voice never shines any brighter then on this song. <br /> <br />P.L.U.C.K. - A homage to their homeland, Armenia. For more info, please visit serjikalstrike.com <br /> <br />Peephole - This song is amazing, spooky, almost sounding like a circus tune. Best song on the album next to: <br /> <br />Soil - The guitars on this song sets it apart for me from all the rest. I love his style, and the drums are amazing. Lyrically, its about a friend who commited suicide.. <br /> <br />JUST BUY THE ALBUM.

B000002UAX|5.0|Ok, if you get the White Album, you can't expect just one genre or one sound. It's kindof the Beatles' everything album. I mean, you've got everything from Wild Honey Pie to Helter Skelter to Good Night to Julia. It's pretty awesome.    anyway, here's a few highlights -    Back in the USSR: Jab at the Beach Boys, everybody likes it.  Dear Prudence: My personal favorite Beatle song. Very flower-child-y  Glass Onion: Moderate Rocker, trippy lyrics  ObLaDi ObLaDa: Life goes on, bra.  Wild Honey Pie: What the???  While My Guitar Gently Weeps: If you're a guitarist, it's a love song  Rocky Raccon: I just think its kinda funny. It's a country  tune about a showdown. Haha.  Why Don't We Do It in the Road: Good for cleaning house, I think.  Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey: they must've been pretty high when they did that one.  Helter Skelter: Spike your hair and don your leather pants.  Revolution 1: Acoustic version of the more popular \\"Revolution 2\\"  Revoltion 9: You've got to be open minded. It's not \\"music\\", the Beatles referred to it as \\"a sound collage\\". It's not something you'd listen to on a regular basis.  Cry Baby Cry: there's something reminiscent and mysterious about it. Very John. I dig it.  Good Night: Poor Ringo. It's terrible. Especially the part where he whispers. Oh, it's so bad.    All in All, it's a Must Have for a Beatles person or a hippie or a guitarist or any well-rounded CD collection. It'll blow away that image of the Beatles as some little \\"Yeah Yeah Yeah\\" group, that's for sure.    enjoy
B00004RJEG|5.0|This should be titled \\"Best of the Corrs.\\"  Very intimate gathering of this band.  Performance goes on to be the best of the DVDs being offered.  If you like the Corrs you will love this DVD.
B0002S94OS|5.0|This CD is very good. Although it follows the same formula as \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" it seems as though there is more added qualities. I could be wrong but to me it seems as if \\"Ashes of the Wake\\" contains a cleaner, tighter, sound quality and production allowing the bass guitar to come out more as well as the powerful guitar riffs (which come in the many). The Double bass is consistant and adds an excellent back drop to the guitars. And even though Randy's voice hasn't really changed since \\"As the Palaces Burn\\" he does change his voice pattern going from his normal growl to death growls and screechs. His voice fits very well with the music even though my friend finds that he could've pulled his voice out more I explained to him that it wouldn't fit with the assaulting guitars and the pounding double bass. <br /> <br />Each song is very well put together and the lyrics are great usually revolving around politics or religion. My favorite track would have to be \\"Hourglass\\" I really like the part when the guitar breaks down and pulls a riff and the double bass adds an interesting groove. Then it's say in a whispering tone \\"It's only getting worse\\" and then Randy screams for a good 10-20 seconds. It's beautiful. There really isn't a bad track on here. All of the tracks sorta sound the same but it's easy to get used to that. It's only 9 dollars at best buy so what reason would you not to buy this CD? Maybe you don't like metal but then why would you read this? <br />GO buy this CD, you won't regret it. <br />

B000000WG4|1.0|Had a listen to the HDCD remaster of this so-called classic album.  What garbage.  I'm a big fan of early FLoyd and Genesis so can appreciate conceptual albums, but they have something that TB is lacking...music. <br /> <br />This is just an unconnected, often crude and grating, collection of seemingly disparate streams of music played on various high and low tech instruments. <br /> <br />Must have been 'wacky' at the time, but now is impossible for me to listen to! <br /> <br />
B000002MP2|4.0|The title says it all.This is the only good Green Day CD I've heard. <br />
B0002BO0AS|4.0|I have to say this album is one of the most heavy metalcore cd's I've heard. When I saw Unearth live, I was so impressed that I had to get it. It's full of angry screams, devestating riffs, and drumming that just increases the overall intensity of the sound. <br />So with that in mind I recommend this to anyone who likes metal or especially metalcore.  <br />However I do have one problem with this album and thats the lyrics. Pollution this, environment that...are you serious?! This is heavy metal not some sort of greenpeace tribute! The validity of the subject matter is a-material, it simply makes me laugh when I hear some intense guitar riffs followed by the vocalist screaming \\"WHAT HAVE WE DONE?!\\" Chosen a boring subject for music, thats what buddy! <br />Otherwise this is a kicking cd and very enjoyable.

B00012L786|5.0|This is one of the finest low budget crime films of the fifties, one that manages to get an extraordinary number of things right.  After a dozen years of film noir and tough detective films, one would have imagined that most of the angles would have been tried and worked to exhaustion, but PICKUP ON NOON STREET managed to be amazingly fresh and original.  It is also a multi-layered film.  On one level, it is an espionage film, with federal authorities, with the help of local police in New York, on the trail of a group selling secrets to the Communists.  Interestingly, the collaborators are not treated as political individuals, but utterly unprincipled capitalists.  As Joey, Richard Kiley's character, puts it early in the film to his former girlfriend Candy, \\"How many times do I have to tell you we're not criminals.  This is big business.\\"<br /><br />The film features a first rate cast.  Except possibly for his screen debut in KISS OF DEATH, Richard Widmark was never better than he was in this film as three-time loser pickpocket Skip McCoy.  The ultimate anti-hero, McCoy's motives are complex and opaque, even at the end.  Jean Peters, later Mrs. Howard Hughes (to whom she was married from 1957 to 1971), is fetching as Candy, a shady dame with a past but with the proverbial heart of gold.  Richard Kiley is suitably slimy as Joey, the seller of secrets to the Communists.  Kiley would later (after his voice darkened) become the narrator for dozens upon dozens of National Geographic specials (such a familiar voice that they joke in JURAISSAC PARK about getting him to do the voice over for their guided tour).  Thelma Ritter, as she did so often in the forties and fifties, steals every scene she is in as the necktie-selling, police informing Moe Williams, who is saving up for her gravestone and burial plot (\\"If they buried me in potter's field, it would just kill me\\").<br /><br />The psychology of the characters comes straight from Mickey Spillane.  A notable instance is the way Candy falls for Skip McCoy.  This aspect of the film isn't merely improbable:  it is impossible.  Skip picks her pocket.  He causes her to go on a long search for him while paying off stoolies along the way.  He slugs her upon their next meeting when he finds her going through his things, robs her purse while she is unconscious, and then pours beer on her face to wake her up.  After kissing her, he unceremoniously tosses her out on the street.  When she returns, he kisses her some more, before pushing her down, taking all the money out of her purse, and then shaking her down for more money.  And, of course, by this time she is hopelessly in love with him.  In what universe is this possible?  None, but for the sake of the drama we accept it effortlessly.<br /><br />The film is stuffed with marvelous details, whether dialogue, music, or sets.  No one seeing the film could ever forget Skip's bizarre waterfront lodgings, in which he cools his beer (and stores his booty) by lowering a wooden box into the East River with a rope.  Among dozens of great touches, one of my favorites is when a stoolie, eating Chinese food, takes his tip money and puts it in his pocket using chopsticks.  The score, by the relatively unknown Leigh Harline, nonetheless manages to be almost as edgy as Edward Hermann.<br /><br />Interestingly, for all the film's cynicism and edginess, it actually ends up with a more conventional happy ending than most of the hardboiled crime films of the forties and fifties.  The guy and the gal end up together, and perhaps even happy.  Moe tells Skip,  \\"Stop using your hands, Skip, and start using your head.\\"  He does, and all ends well.  By the end, the bad guys are all either dead or in jail.  What is fascinating about all this is that it was a direct violation of the Code, which decreed that all characters who engage in crime must be shown as paying for those crimes by the end of the film (which is why all those Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney villainsof the thirties always died by the end of the film).  Skip McCoy is not only a creep, he is a thief, yet at the end he is not only punished:  he is given a clean bill of health for cooperating in taking down Commies.  As such, he is one of the most unique anti-heroes of the age.<br /><br />This is an absolute must-see film though I would like to add that for a Criterion film, this has perhaps the smallest number of first-rate features that I can recall.  The print itself is pristine and gorgeous, but you get no additional video features.  All the features are either articles or printed interviews.y villains of the thirties always died by the end of the film).

B00004TDTO|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie by now, then you must be living under a rock or in a deep, dark cave. \\"Jaws\\" is the story of a great-white shark that terrorizes the waters of a popular vacation town. The shark picks a few swimmers off one-by-one and the sheriff of the town (Roy Scheider) is put in charge of taking care of this problem. With the help of a biologist (Richard Dryfuss) and a crazy shark hunter (Robert Shaw), the three set out on a quest to catch the gigantic shark. Little do they know, they would become the hunted. <br /> <br />\\"Jaws\\" was made in 1975. This was the days before special effects. So, the shark had to be mechanical. Much has been made about how hard it was to make this movie. The shark kept breaking down and the film went way over budget. The end result is definately worth all the problems. This is the best shark film ever made and was genuinely scary, even to this day. This film literally made people think twice about going swimming back in the 70's, and it makes you think for a second even by today's standards. <br /> <br />The story is from a best-selling novel. Apparently not much was changed from the book. The acting was very good. Scheider, Dryfuss, and Shaw carry the movie. Shaw, in particular, was amazing. His quirky portrayl of a shark hunter, is the highlight of the cast. Scheider plays the everyman role here well. He just keeps the movie afloat until the meat of the flick kicks in. I thought Dryfuss did a great job, as well. <br /> <br />I don't think I have to go into this movie much further. Most people on this planet have seen it at least once. I think it is a classic and definately a must-own DVD. I enjoyed watching this movie again and reliving the fears that it brought with it. <br /> <br />Special Features: There is a very good documentary about the making of the movie. There's some deleted scenes and a couple outtakes. A trivia game, shark world, and a few trailers round out the supplements.
055314765X|5.0|The only bad thing I can say about Day of the Jackal is that just about every other espionage/thriller novel that I have read since then has paled in comparison. Forsyth's novel moves at a steady pace, shifting its focus between an enigmatic assassin and the French police inspector who is doggedly pursuing him. The journalistic writing style shuns sensationalism for fly-on-the-wall realism, and indeed one of the pleasures of Day of the Jackal is the voyeuristic look into the underworld it provides. While Day of the Jackal makes no attempt to tackle great themes of \\"literature,\\" it succeeds so well in entertaining the reader that it belongs on the shelf next to Ernest Hemingway or Jack London rather than certain contemporary writers whose contributions to this genre suffer in comparison.

B00005JMAH|2.0|I watched this when it opened, and I thought it was ok.  But a couple weeks later, I watched again.  I was a little dissapointed to find that the jokes weren't THAT funny, and the acting wasn't THAT great.  I also realized my favorite parts from the book hadn't made the cut into the movie and the scenes were all out of order.  Although Alfonso Cuarn did a nice job of piecing the scenes together. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie, but instead renting it IF you haven't seen it before.
0385659806|5.0|I work with kids with Autism/Aspergers, and I liked the fact the author wrote it in a way that wasn't patronizing (you didn't feel sorry for Christopher because he has 'special needs'). I liked the parts when Chris described his 'behaviour problems', his joke about the mathematician and the cows, and his dream that would seem morbid and disturbing to people with tangible emotions but to him is calming. I read the book in 3 hours (I read quickly mind you,) but you will be hard pressed to put the book down when you begin. Great Read!

This one is exciting, well paced, and very enjoyable.<br /><br />Someone (Bourne) is found floating at sea, with two bullets in his back and a mysterious message surgically implanted. He wakes up with no idea who, where, or even what he is. He has some skills - languages, and more ominous skills that seem to scare even him. And people are trying to kill him.<br /><br />OK, the \\"amnesia\\" plot has been used until it's almost used up. This is really a chases'n'action film, and needed something to get it started. Once the amnesia premise jump-starts the movie, it moves forward very well by itself. Matt Damon did a good job in the title role, except maybe for being too much of a nice guy for the history that eventually catches up to him.<br /><br />I don't normally pay a lot of attention to DVD extras. This has one nice extra, though: a choice of two start and end scenes. The theater edition was good enough, but the extra version was more interesting. It was also more conducive to sequels.<br /><br />If you want a spy/action flick, try this one out. I don't think it will ever become a classic, but it's still good.<br /><br />//wiredweird

0321213351|5.0|Kerievsky has done it. He has started to pull together anti-patterns (a.k.a. \\"bad smells\\"), refactorings, and patterns into one unified study. All three work well individually. Together, they make a powerful combination.<br /><br />This isn't as rigorously analytic as the original Design Patterns book. I fully expect more theory-oriented writers to follow the trail blazed here. Instead, Kerievsky gives worked examples, in great detail. At every point, he starts with a code sample drawn from real life, complex enough to be interesting. Then, step by step, he shows the incremental changes made to transition from it's problematic start to its pattern-based end point. Experienced programmers may find this plodding and repetitive. Beginners, however, often have a hard time planning incremental changes and executing them. The author takes care to keep the code in working order at each increment, showing a clear path through the forest of possibilities. Some readers may even trace the path backwards, giving another look at how each change moves toward the end state. The worked examples are the real strength of this text.<br /><br />This is a book for the software maintainer. In other words, it addresses 90% or 99% of the work that real programmers do. Just about every other software text on the market assumes that the project just started - the disks are empty and the compiler shrink-wrap is on the floor. I admit, that kind of programming  is the most fun. It's just not realistic, though. Most work is rework, the kind demonstrated here.<br /><br />Another great feature of this book is what it lacks: dogmatic harangues about methodology. It even keeps a skeptical attitude towards patterns, since heavyweight design techniques aren't always right for lightweight problems. Kerievsky mentions agile-ism, but doesn't make it a part of the process. He does, however, take the continuous testing idea from the eXtremists and work that into the demonstrations. Bravo! Hardware designers may wonder what the fuss is about, since thorough testing has been part of their culture for years. It's a happy novelty in much of the software world, though, and deserves to become standard practice.<br /><br />My only problem with this book is that there isn't more of it. For example, constructor chaining is a great idea. There are two kind of chain, though. He shows the increasing parameter list, where simpler constructors supply default values for the more ones with more parameters. It's also possible to chain in decreasing order, where each constructor processes one parameter and passes on the simplified list. (What's good for constructors, of course, is also good for other collections of related methods.)<br /><br />The book's ideal reader understands an OO language, uses subclassing regularly, and knows something about design patterns. That reader, with enough patience to follow the examples, will learn a lot. More experienced developers won't need the step by step approach, but may benefit from seeing multiple refactorings working together to solve a complex problem. It has my highest recommendation for any developer who really thinks about design and redesign.<br /><br />//wiredweirdsigners may wonder what the fuss is about, since thorough testing has been part of their culture for years.

0393035158|5.0|Here is a brilliant thinker and masterful writer asking the really fundamental questions about religion's influence in world events today.   Why do so many Americans still believe the Bible was written by God, Harris asks, when its author demonstrates no knowledge of science and demands capital punishment for marital infidelity?   And why do so many think Islam is a \\"religion of peace\\" when its holiest book calls for death to unbelievers on almost every other page?   But the most stunning arguments in this unforgettable work come in the latter half when Harris argues for a kind of spirituality based in reason, which could fill the void created by an \\"end of faith\\" in traditional holy scriptures.  Our world desperately needs this brave and fascinating book!   I will soon max out my credit card buying copies for my friends.

B0002I831S|4.0|It was nice to see extra featurettes on the original series DVDs after enjoying them on all the other Star Trek sets.  But they still seem pretty frugal.  The text commentaries by Okuda range from common sense stuff to some pretty interesting material if you can stand to read all the boxes.  But some of them stay on the screen for barely a second and I often had to pause the DVD to read them; also the background they use to make the comments readable is awful--it makes them in many cases very difficult to read.  I sure would have liked to see some real commentaries by surviving cast members--even one episode per major actor would have been nice.  Another thing that bothers me is the order in which the episodes are presented--original airdate order and not production order as they were in the original 40 releases (which for my money are still superior if for no other reasons than they are not as compressed with single layer and as I said presented chronologically).  The packaging is cool looking but got annoying real fast--the actual inside box the discs come in is cheap like the Voyager sets.  And the little booklet listing the episodes is odd--really just fluff.  Don't pay full price for this set.  Grab it at Sam's Club or get it used here on Amazon.

B00006IU73|5.0|I have been a PT fan for a couple years, buying their CD's  wherever I could find them (many available here) and listening to them exclusively for weeks at a time. 'In Absentia' is an album analogous to 'Dark Side of the Moon' in that a heretofore obscure band is finding points of intersection with a broader audience; apparently much to the chagrin of the Opeth/death metal crowd who thought Steve Wilson spoke only for their little Gothic nighmares.   Pink Floyd's work was once described as \\"head shop muzak\\" before they put new power and meaning into their take on the shadows in the human soul. Steve Wilson and PT have done the same here - punched it up an order of magnitude with guitar work and melodies that a 50-something with a mortgage and mind trained on 70's prog rock can listen to and see themselves - not just a 20-something with a nose ring working the counter at Starbuck's and nursing some abstract death wish.    Porcupine Tree has also been described as \\"Pink Floyd for the 21st century\\". Personally, I think PF always was 21st century, but I see the sentiment. If, like me, you hunger for fresh and professional treatment of the theme of darkness - the kind that defines and informs the light that also lives within you - buy this album and crank it up.
B000002H97|5.0|Here we have Metallica's breakthrough album, the Black album.  This is what put Metallica into the mainstream, and it is indeed a masterpeice.  Every song on this on is a classic.  The talent is all there.  The production is crystal clear.  Everything about this album is epic.  A lot of people complain that this is all a little too mainstream, but I disagree.  I believe the boys to be in top performance, just because it's a little more accessible, doesn't mean that the talent is gone.  Kirk plays some of his greatest solos on this album.  I believe that everyone is in top form.  Jason Newsted also gets a chance to prove himself on this one.  As a bassist, I believe his basslines on the slower songs to showcase his talent the most.  He packs a lot of emotion, especially in Nothing Else Matters.  Overall, this is just a fun and enjoyable cd with talented musicians and songwriting.  Highly recommended!
B000001Y2U|5.0|when i first heard this cd i didnt like it but then it grew in me and now its one of my fav manson albums
B000002H6C|5.0|This is when things really started happening for Metallica.  A lot of people say that this is Metallica's greatest, but I disagree.  Sure, it's a great album, but I don't think it's as good as Master Of Puppets, which is what I believe to be their masterpiece.  The songs are all incredibly long which is something I favor.  You get nine songs packed onto an hour and five minute long album.  Every song is top knotch, but the production is just so wretched.  It sounds so much older.  This is also the debut of bassist Jason Newsted, but you can barely hear him, so he gets no chance to proove himself on this one.  Every song is great, however, bass or no bass.  The lyrics are awesome as usual.  Even Lars is in top form by adding some double bass throughout.  One has got to be one of Metallica's greatest songs ever, and that alone is worth the price of the album.  All in all, this is a great old school release, still highly recommended.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Yes, this movie is about the rise and fall of George Jung, however the most important person in the movie... Pablo Escobar is a bit left out by the other reviewers. The movie does a great job with an excellent cast depicting George Jung's marijuana and cocaine empire's rise and fall... it even does a good job talking about Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel's role in helping George Jung. It even brings in Carlos Diego. The movie isn't as good as the book by Bruce Porter but David McKenna did a good job writing a screenplay. Great movie, deffinately worth owning!
B000002H33|5.0|This has to be my favorate Metallica album, and their best in my opinion.  I don't know what it is about this album, perhaps the melodic acoustic parts, or maybe the old school production that makes me pop it in the cd player over and over.  Every song on this is a classic.  The lyrics are amazing as most old school Metallica lyrics are.  The guitar solos rip their way through as fast as always.  The Thing That Should Not Be houses one of my favorate guitar solos of all time.  This is just an amazing album that I believe to be a great peak in Metallica's career.  Try and tell me that Orion isn't the best instrumental Metallica has ever done.  Sadly, this is also the last album with Cliff.  He sure did leave his mark as a great musician by being a part of this album.  This is a great album that every metal head should own.  Highly Recommended!

B000068QZK|5.0|I really was impressed with this album. I've listened to Ozzy since I could remember and he really peaked with this album.<br /><br />The lyrics are out of this world, especially for Breaking All The Rules.<br /><br />I can relate to these lyrics for so many reasons, but it is never to late to consider following rules.<br /><br />I have broken so many rules and have only been heart-broken, so Ozzy thanks for your personal devotion to rock n roll. God Bless You and your Family!!!!!

GREAETEST METAL ALBUM EVER!!
B000063DFS|5.0|No More Tears shows Ozzy attempting to break into the mainstream with radio flavored songs. Definately not his schtick - Ozzy was never an artist who was supposed to bow to whatever trend was selling at the time, but No More Tears certainly showed that greed can and does influence people. Probably one of most successful albums (if not THE most successful album) he's ever made, but the songs themselves always make or break the case - in this example, the case was broken. Mama, I'm Coming Home? Time After Time? I Don't Wanna Change the World? Bah. Give me the REAL Ozzy Osbourne or just keep it. Judging on his recent record sales over the last few albums he's released, apparently I'm not alone in that opinion...
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This album got the most improvement compare to the rest of the remastered cd's<br /><br />The drum sounds and guitar tone especially, it surprisingly sounded better than the original. Off course some people prefers the original while some prefers the remastered version. Personally, I like both , some songs sounds better on remastered and some dont.<br /><br />Mary Jane is my fav tune from this record and it sounds much better on this remastered version than the original. You could hear all little details from all the riffs  very clearly. The acoustic part on this one sounds  wicked compare to the original.<br /><br />plus the bonus track, this is must own for all fans

B000031WI8|5.0|I'm an 80's music fan and the group Wham! was definitely one of my favorites.

George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley were a dynamic duo from the U.K.
B000065DWH|5.0|Randy Newman's portrait of the Southern United States represents a peak in his career and a culmination of four albums. Begged and beaten into the music industry by friends and colleagues (one of them supposedly John Lennon, who called Newman to say that all of the Beatles had heard his demos), Newman's fourth album of original material provides evidence that those friends and colleagues provided us a great service. \\"Good Old Boys\\" stands as one of Newman's greatest acheivements, and arguably one of the greatest albums of the 1970s. Rolling Stone even proclaimed it the 393rd best album of all time in 2003 (though it probably deserves to be put much higher).<br /><br />A furtive glance at the album's title, and an accompanying peek at the song titles (\\"Rednecks\\", \\"Birmingham\\", Naked Man\\", \\"Guilty\\") would suggest a slam dunk satirical no holds barred slash at the south. Not so. Newman approaches the subject with dignity and a balance not often bequeathed to the United States' southern states. Not to say that \\"Good Old Boys\\" eulogizes the South (this is no \\"Gone With The Wind\\"). The bad and ugly also creep in: racism, prejudice, drunkedness, poverty, populism, obscenity. Newman, himself a Southerner by birth, has forayed into this territory before. 1970's \\"12 Songs\\" included \\"Old Kentucky Home\\" and \\"Yellow Man\\", though the former contained more nudge nudge satire than \\"Good Old Boys\\". This album expands on the themes explored in those songs and expands it into the length of an entire album. The results come out more in context than they do on a song-by-song basis. For example, \\"Birmingham\\" and \\"Marie\\", both amazing songs, take on a different tone when following \\"Rednecks\\". \\"Rollin'\\" represents the sigh of denial after a long arduous inhale. The song feels different in isolation than it does at the end of the song cycle of \\"Good Old Boys\\". This entails a tightly composed and well thought out collection of amazing songs. They all stand on their own but nonetheless take on a different life in the context of the album.<br /><br />\\"Rednecks\\" has to be Newman's most shocking song for more reasons than its abrasive lyrics. Somehow it manages sympathetic, vindictive, satirical, racist, and anti-racist sentiments all at once. It puts the 'redneck' stereotype under the microscope and proclaims that the issues are more complex than they seem. It revels in Southern stereotypes while pointing the finger northward in the justifiably famous lines about the the northern 'cages' where blacks are kept in the \\"free\\" states. Indirectly it says \\"at least we're honest about it down here\\". It does all of this without promoting stereotypes or racism. This incomprehensible dichotomy pervades the entire album. Especially in Newman's portrait of Huey Long in \\"Every Man a King\\" which leads into \\"Kingfish\\".<br /><br />Newman takes the orchestral lessons and arrangements learned from his previous albums and puts them to incredible work here. Strings, horns, steel guitar, and Newman's distinctive piano all fall together here in perfect balance. Completely gone are the instrumental excesses and self-conscious arrangements of his first two albums (i.e., he overused the orchestra on his first album and abandoned it on his second). \\"Louisiana 1927\\" contains one of the most beautifully orchestrated choruses in all of pop music, and stands as one of Newman's best. The amazing strings on \\"Kingfish\\" and \\"Rollin'\\" also deserve mention, though all songs are notable.<br /><br />The 2CD set includes the demo for \\"Good Old Boys\\" called \\"Johnny Cutler's Birthday\\". This reveals the album's origins in a concept album revolving around one person. This focus proved too narrow for the subject matter, and at least six of the songs on the demo did not make the final album. One of them revolves around extreme profanity. Others fill in the story line (narrated by Newman in between his solo piano and voice takes). All are top notch Newman and will leave listeners wondering what elselurks in Newman's vault.<br /><br />\\"Good Old Boys\\" stands as one one Newman's most impressive achievements. Every Randy Newman fan needs this CD set. Both the original album and the demo remain on firm solid concrete hard ground some thirty years later.at else lurks in Newman's vault. <br /> <br />\\"Good Old Boys\\" stands as one one Newman's most impressive achievements.

B0002CTSTK|5.0|Kill Bill Volume 2 has continued Volume 1 amazingly. It doesn't let down the audience at all: more story, more character development, more Tarantino-ized but without a lack of action. Some people may think this one was too slow but keeping in mind they were meant to be watched together, if you do do that, it won't seem slow at all because Volume 1 ends with a huge battle. So please, buy this DVD because it is the best thing in the world and please, watch Volume 1 and 2 together in one sitting.
B000068GA4|5.0|The classic second solo album from the former Misfits and Samhain singer found Danzig and his band perfecting their sound from their breakthrough debut album.  \\"Lucifuge\\" is darker, heavier, and actually catchier than what was offered on their debut, and it's all the better.  Starting off with \\"Long Way Back From Hell\\" which finds Danzig's voice soaring to new heights, while \\"Killer Wolf\\", \\"Devil's Plaything\\", \\"777\\", and \\"Pain in the World\\" feature guitarist John Christ, drummer Chuck Biscuits, and bassist Eerie Von finding their niche and becoming one tight, cohesive unit.  Oh yeah, who can forget \\"Her Black Wings\\"?  This is essential listening, but \\"Lucifuge\\" only paved the way for what I consider to be Danzig's finest album, \\"How the Gods Kill\\".
B0002EXH40|5.0|Actual Rating- 4.5 Stars)<br /><br />Youthanasia(1994). Megadeth's Sixth Studio Release.<br /><br />In 1994, Grunge, stricken with the death of Kurt Cobain, began to get less and less popular, and with the 1995 releases of Soundgarden's 'Superunknown' and Alice In Chain's self-titled album, that genre sadly went out of style and was replaced with Rap-Metal(god help us). Always in the shadow of things, bands like Megadeth and Metallica, who hit it big in the early-90's, tried valiantly to repeat their sucess, and with the 1994 release of 'Youthanasia', Megadeth once again entered the Top 30. While Metallica's 'Load'(which was released later the next year) has since become a disgrace even if it did go to #1, Megadeth prospered until the release of 'Risk', which effectively saw them \\"selling-out\\" too. In retrospect, 'Youthanasia' has been described by fans as one of Megadeth's best, and certainly their last great album. So, is 'Youthanasia' a good listen, or a sorry state of affairs? Read on to find out!<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />Reckoning Day- 'Youthanasia' starts off with \\"Reckoning Day\\", an unforgiving, metallic attack that blends thunderous, pounding guitar riffs and demented vocals with the solos and choruses Megadeth fans have come to know and love.<br /><br />Train of Consequences- One of Megadeth's strongest tracks, \\"Train of Consequences\\" starts off with the *spit-fire*(It's undescribable, but amazing) guitar riff, but Mustaine turns the song into an optomistic, melodic look at the possibilities of life. Mustaine's pained vocals and Friedman's wacky guitar work will blow you away!<br /><br />Addicted To Chaos- A slow thrasher, \\"Addicted To Chaos\\" uses a pulsing guitar riff and melodic vocals from Mustaine to create a *slow* rocker not unlike their hit \\"Almost Honest\\". Friedman and Mustaine hit all the right notes, and Menza's drumming won't fail to please. Not really a ballad, yet one of Megadeth's more emotional tracks.<br /><br />A Tout Le Monde- 'Youthanasia's biggest hit, and most unlikely, finds Megadeth doing a ballad about lost love, but what's weirder is Mustaine sings the chorus entirely in French! Friedman and Mustaine spit out emotional rhythm and electric guitar melodies, and Mustaine's vocals(for once!) work extremely well, giving the song a deep sense of emotion. Unless you can't stand French(the language), \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" is an emotional ballad you won't soon forget.<br /><br />Elysian Fields- Megadeth goes back to their Thrash roots on \\"Elysian Fields\\", a dark and sarcastic at the death of Jesus Christ(It's not sacreligious at all..). Mustaine's creepy vocals and Friedman's doomy guitar riff go from metallic to punky, and the chorus is something to behold(It reminds me of Alice In Chains). Good song.<br /><br />The Killing Road- Much like Testament's Death Metal material of the 90's, \\"The Killing Road\\" is a dark, dreadfully hopeless ode to going insane, mixed with Mustaine's uncaring(don't worry, they aren't Death Metal vocals) vocals and Friedman's thumping guitar riff. Great musicianship, great song!<br /><br />Blood of Heroes- Beginning much like  an epic from the Boston Symphony, \\"Blood of Heroes\\" soon turns into a \\"kill-or-be-killed\\" song, complete with amazing solos, riffs, and time signature changes from Mustaine and Friedman's duel-guitar attack. Mustaine's dark lyrics and creepy vocals work well! I like this one a lot!<br /><br />Family Tree- Although it starts like \\"A Tout Le Monde\\", \\"Family Tree\\", complete with an emotional rhythm guitar melody, soon turns into a seedy rocker about the government trying to cover up conspiracies. Friedman and Mustaine's guitar antics go well with Ellefson's addictive bassline, and Mustaine's vocals echo back to the good ol' days of \\"Hangar 18\\". C-O-O-L!<br /><br />Youthanasia- The album's title track, \\"Youthanasia\\" is an interesting look at the demons of Dave Mustaine, yet the song,  which features \\"distorted\\" vocals from Mustaine, doesn't really pick up until much later in the song. When it DOES pick up, Friedman dishes out an amazing solo, not to mention some great riffs. If the beginning of this song wasn't so *lame*, \\"Youthanasia\\" would be one of the album's best. Good.<br /><br />I Thought I Knew It All- A Thrash song with a melodic chorus, \\"I Thought I Knew It All\\" begins like any other Megadeth song, with a remorseless and dark riff, not to mention \\"gloom-and-doom\\" vocals from Mustaine, but the emotional chorus finds Megadeth doing a melodic song not unlike \\"A Tout Le Monde\\". Nonetheless, the musicianship is good and the song rules!<br /><br />Black Curtains- Think of the heavy, dark, Thrash qualities of 80's Metallica and mix that with the duel-guitar attack and creepy lyrics of Iron Maiden and you get \\"Black Curtains\\", a dark thrasher that finds every musician playing their heart out. One of the album's highlights.<br /><br />Victory- A parody of Megadeth itself, \\"Victory\\" looks back at all of the songs in Megadeth's career(The lyrics talk about \\"Holy Wars\\" and \\"Countdown To Extinction\\"), and Ellefson's punchy bassline and Megadeth's punky vocals make \\"Victory\\" a very interesting track.<br /><br />The 2004 'Youthanasia' remaster contains three new tracks, \\"Millennium Of The Blind\\", \\"New World Order\\", and \\"Absolution\\", and a new version of \\"A Tout Le Monde\\". These tracks are icing on the cake, and they add to the album even if they are short!<br /><br />Overall, 'Youthanasia', while not being as good as Megadeth's 80's material and 'Rust In Peace', is definitely an improvement over 'Countdown To Extinction'. It's a very good album, showcasing some of Mustaine's best vocals and showing that Mustaine and Marty Friedman can still spit out solos worthy of honor. While not being a perfect record, it's still a great choice for Megadeth fans, and certainly better than anything Metallica, Anthrax, or Slayer put out around the same time(1994-1995).<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF THRASH, HEAVY METAL, AND MEGADETH! IF YOU'RE A NEWBIE, GO FOR 'RUST IN PEACE', BUT IF YOU WANT TO WIDEN YOUR COLLECTION, PICK UP 'YOUTHANASIA'!<br /><br />Killer Kuts- \\"Train of Consequences\\", \\"A Tout Le Monde\\", \\"The Killing Road\\", \\"Family Tree\\", \\"Black Curtains\\", and \\"Victory\\".<br /><br />Also Recommended-<br /><br />Rust In Peace- Megadeth<br /><br />Souls of Black- Testament<br /><br />The Black Album- Metallicadoesn't really pick up until much later in the song. When it DOES pick up, Friedman dishes out an amazing solo, not to mention some great riffs. If the beginning of this song wasn't so *lame*, \\"Youthanasia\\" would be one of the album's best.

B000286RKW|5.0|One of those rare cases where everything just seems to click, Goodfellas is one of a kind.  Nearly perfect in terms of casting, acting, directing, and so on, this is director Martin Scorsese (Gangs of New York, Raging Bull) at his finest.  Revolving around the life of mobster turned rat Henry Hill (Ray Liotta, perfectly cast), we bear witness to his rise in the mafia.  His wife Karen (a pre-Sopranos Lorraine Bracco) is along for the ride as she discovers more and more of Henry's \\"other family\\" which both frightens and excites her.  Liotta and Bracco are excellent, and the rest of the cast including Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino, and Joe Pesci in his Oscar winning role are the stuff that film legends are made of.  Scorsese perfectly captured the time period, and his use of music in certain scenes could not be more dead on.  I still don't know if this is indeed the best mob movie ever (it's tough to top the Godfather), but if it isn't, it's pretty close.  Look for Samuel L. Jackson in a minor role, as well as pre-Sopranos stars Michael Imperrioli and Tony Sirico.  Warner Bros. finally decided to give Goodfellas the DVD treatment it deserves, and the commentaries by Scorsese and crew and Hill himself are worth the price of admission alone.
0380789035|2.0|This book was boring. I expected a little bit more from the author of Neverwhere and Coraline.<br /><br />Gaimon is a master of creating colorful and unsettling characters, and in that respect he does not disappoint. Certin scenes and images from the book last long after the plot fades. But overall, I found it a chore to see this book through to the end. The story was plodding at times, and I just didn't connect with Shadow enough to care about what happened to him.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I just finished reading the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card and the Golden Compass Series by Philip Pullman, two of the best series ever written(!), but I couldn't help but feel that this was mere pulp fiction, and that  I could have spent my free time with something a bit more satisfying.
B000002IWH|5.0|this collaboration set the mood for the crow perfectly. each and every one of the crow soundtracks are good in their own, but this one takes the lead. i love nine inch nails and dead souls (track 4) is one of their best. golatha tenement blues was a great song from a band i have never heard of called machines of loving grace (track 2). ghost rider is a decent song from the rollins band (track 7). after the flesh from my life with the thrill kill kult (track 11) sounds like something ministry did. over all great soundtrack.
B00003CXCT|3.0|I do not get it.. I mean, is nothing sacred? <br /> <br />So Lucas doesn't want the originals released, ever again? But.. they were actually... good compared to the trash he's sticking his name to now. <br /> <br />I can understand some changes. But, to me, changing your movies because you can seems.. slightly hypocritical to me. <br /> <br />I thank God that only George Lucas seems to think that changing amazing movies with unnecessary details is necessary. I mean, what if Francis Ford Coppola just, decided that he wanted the Kool-Aid guy to kill off Michael Corleone's brother at the toll booth in the Godfather series? He wouldn't. And you know why? Because Francis Ford Coppola isn't a tool like George Lucas is. <br /> <br />And another thing, Hayden Christensen CAN NOT ACT. I guess it's good that he's replacing the other guy at the end of ROTJ, all he has to do is stand there and look pretty, and NOT speak. In my opinion, it'll be his best work to date.
B0000062GE|5.0|this is the stabbing westwards climax in the music industry in my opinion. their first cd, ungod was great, but it sounded a little too much like MDFMK. wither, blister, burn and peel wasn't bad. but didn't stand out like darkest days. their self titled cd following this showed their decline into popish sounding music.<br /><br />the entire album is great.  it is angst at its best. the choruses touch your heart, if you have one. there was so many amazing songs on this cd, it is one of my favorites of all time. my favorites are how can i hold on, you complete me (best song on the cd), save yourself (best known and really catchy like most hits), thing i hate (located on the duke nukem: music to score by soundtrack) and of course waking up beside you (the most heartfelt and touching song on the cd).<br /><br />buy this cd if you want an amazing accomplishment by an industrial band who didn't seem to get the recognition they deserved.
B00003CX95|2.0|Mel Gibson's movie \\"Braveheart\\" is the story about the life of William Wallace trying to lead Scotland to its independence from England. The only historical details about William Wallace are those of a bard's poems. So, Mel Gibson rewrites history. The movie is full of gory violence, romance, patriotism (if you can call it that), battle, adultery and passion. While the scenery and music is good, most of the movie is all passion and no brains. I saw some of the reviews of the movie and realize how this movie would appeal to the simple minded - one reviewer writing, \\"If you do not like this movie, you are a moron\\". Most people from Scotland found this movie silly.  <br /> <br />The positives, it has a story of passion, with great score and some of the actors like Patrick McGoohan and Sophie Marceau did a good job. The movie starts well but progressively gets worse.  <br />The negatives, it shows that the Wallace is starting the whole thing based on revenge and not on ideals, his wife gets killed. So, he starts his rebellion. No Scot would like such a portrayal. He commits adultery with the Princess of Wales, so he is no different from the English, the very people he wishes to vanquish. The English are slandered in a way that is not documented such as \\"Prima Noctes\\", no Englishman would like that. Though it is a movie, I do not think that Mel Gibson would like it if some one makes a movie of him and slanders him similarly. It shows the Scots wearing kilts all the time, they never wore them until the 18th century. The battle scenes are extremely violent and parts such as Irish changing sides in the beginning of the battle is ridiculous. The part where he cries \\"Freedom\\" before he is beheaded is the silliest. The story of Robert the Bruce is also not real. Basically, it appears to be a hastily put together script without checking any veracity (or giving a damn about it). It is difficult to believe that they gave the best director oscar to this movie. I guess this was a weak year. <br /> <br />For people who say that this is the best movie that they have ever seen, I would recommend that they see movies such as \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" or \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\". Those movies have passion, better acting and much more realism. They were made over a longer period with a lot of trouble over the literature to reduce errors and the ridiculous nature of the movies such as this one. There will always be die-hards who will swear by this movie, but quality is measured by whether the movie can stand the passage of time. Compared to a movie like \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" or \\"Shawshank Redemption\\", this movie pales.
B00028HBKM|4.0|This was not as good as they hype. In itself, it was watchable and fairly accurate. Yes, it tended to glamourize the violence a little more than it needed to get the point across. I would have preferred that the ending be extended several minutes (women, apostles, etc.), but it was fitting with the \\"passion\\" aspect of the title. Overall, decent flick, but don't get your expectations too high.
B000268QB2|5.0|The GREAT thing is that the Keane has a UNIQUE way of creating layered melody--they dont use guitars or basses, only keyboards. THIS IS WHY i call Keane an original band, and they DID prove that music built by keyboards is not inferior to music built by power chords. <br /> <br />The music is very popish, catchy, and quiet beatiful. \\"She has no time\\", \\"bend and break\\" and \\"somewhere only we know\\" are all stunning standouts. they sound more like travis in \\"the Man Who\\" era. HOWEVER, I found no comparision to Radiohead, maybe teh singer's voice KINDA resembles Thom Yorks's? But music-wise, radiohead's music sounds WAY more sophisticated than Keane's. <br /> <br />OVERALL, a really good debut. people who like travis and Coldplay will especially appreciate \\"Hopes and Fears\\".
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I was fortunate to stumble across the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" today at a local retailer, 2 days ahead of scheduled release!  You have all seen it so I don't need to go into detail.  The first disc is the exact same as the Divimax edition, same special features and everything.  Disc 2 is the \\"Extended Version\\" which is basically the same thing but with an additional 12 minutes of footage integrated into the film.  The new scenes don't add anything but it is always nice to see new footage.  Disc 3 is the \\"European Version\\" which runs at about 117 minutes.  Some scenes are shortened and some are lengthened and it features some different musical cues by Goblin.  There is also a nice commentary track featuring all four major cast members.  Disc four is a treat!  I features a new 75 minute documentary with interviews featuring cast and crew.  There is also a 90 minute original documentary filmed during the production of the film.  Also included is a short \\"home movie\\" shot by a zombie extra during filming.  The icing on the cake is a recently recorded tour of the mall, with tour guide Ken Foree!  He takes a large group of fans through the mall and tells them what happened where.  David Emge and other cast and crew join Ken on the tour. <br /> <br />By the way, the \\"alternate ending\\" was never filmed so, no, you will not find it here...or anywhere else.
0142004235|5.0|I had this book sitting on my shelf for a year before I finally could give the book the attention that it deserved.  Once I started, I became engrossed.  When I finished, I finished in a flurry, devouring the last 400 pages in about four days. <br /> <br />The themes are universal.  The storylines are familiar to most Westerners.  The story unfolds patiently and deliberately.  The characters are mostly set in opposition (traitwise) of each other for purposes of showing contrasting approaches to life. <br /> <br />I did find a dry humor occasionally in the book.  I did find the book to be universal not only in human conflict but also its timeless in its observations, especially about how the 'now' different from the 'good old days' or in its comments of how generalists have little future. <br /> <br />I did enjoy some subtleties in the writing at times.  For instance when writing Joe's (a minor character who worked for Kate), Steinbeck used very simple words and short sentences to illustrate the unsophisticated nature of the thoughts.  This made the sentences read quickly and served to highlight how shallow the internal monologue really was.  After all, if deep thoughts require complex sentences and expert word usage, how does one convey simple thoughts? <br /> <br />This is one of the best novels that I have read, perhaps the best (not necessarily my favorite) novel that I have read from an American author.
B00022XOAO|5.0|There is no one that conducts Beethoven the way Carlos Kleiber did.  I have recordings of them all: Karajan, Gardiner, Solti, Bernstein, Herreweghe etc; all vastly inferior, almost pale and lifeless in comparison; the only one that comes close is Rattle (whose performance of the 6th I recently admired at Carnegie Hall with the BPO) in his latest cycle.   Kleiber's interpretations are of an optimism, a freshness and a vividness that are so unparalleled, it doesn't matter which orchestra he is playing with. Enjoy this live recording with the Bayerische Staatsorchester!  Check also out Beethoven's 5th & 7th with Kleiber and the VPO on DG.
B0000BXGC8|4.0|I agree with Alex on one thing for sure and that is that &quot;Do This Anymore&quot; is by far the best track on Nickelback's new album. &quot;Someday&quot; is a touching song, but falls short of the drive and passion behind &quot;Do This Anymore.&quot; &quot;Another Hole in the Head,&quot; &quot;Figured You Out&quot; and &quot;Believe it or Not&quot; are great tracks abundant with aggressive guitars, inovative drumming and topped with the unique vocal mix that Chad Kroeger and Ryan Peak have made the band's trade mark sound. &quot;Throw Yourself Away,&quot; &quot;Because of You&quot; and &quot;Should've Listened&quot; are lyrical gems; and, &quot;Fellin' Way too Damn Good&quot; and &quot;See you at the Show&quot; are easier listening with a smoother sound for the less heavy listener. <br />I've loved Nickelback since day one and am very glad they have come this far. Another album like &quot;Curb&quot; however might not be the way to go Alex. &quot;Curb&quot; is great, don't get me wrong, but something more along the lines of &quot;The State&quot; or &quot;Silverside Up&quot; would be a safer choice. &quot;Curb&quot; is not for everyone (it's much harder than any of the other albums and never leaves the same effect on me as one of the other three) nevertheless a worth while album for true fans. I'd love to see them release some of their Hesher recordings that are impossibly rare.<br />The Album as a whole is solid no doubt and Nickelback should be very proud of this accomplishment. The band has come a long way and almost always on their own save for fan support and other key people and certain bands along the way. I hope that after touring in 2004 the guys take time away from everything, just breathe, and come back to their music fresh and ready to go on another great ride. I never want to hear one of them in an interview say they hate a certain song because they didn't take time to themselves just to clear their minds and bodies of touring and band life in general.<br />Most true of this band and for anyone else who's looking for it: Success doesn't come to you, you go to it<br />Jules <br />No disallusion here just great music by a truly unique and worthy band! Canada Rocks (esp. Alberta!!!)
B0002IQJUK|5.0|I used to be a teeny bopper in the worst sense of the word. I didn't listen to anything that hadn't been surgically enhanced by the studio. But Gavin Degraw's Stripped set is finally an indication to myself that studios don't have to do the work if the artist is truly talented. This is probably the best album I've heard in a long time and I'm really surprised radio and MTV haven't picked it  up for some heavy rotation. In the same breath, I'm glad they haven't because then he'd become the product of overplay. The acoustic set is amazing, and although the studio version is incredible, Stripped is what reminds you of what music should be like. \\"Follow Through\\" is a stand out and \\"I don't want to be\\" sounds much more like a song instead of t.v show theme without all the studio work in it. This is definitely worth your money.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Jim Carrey is not Jim Carrey in this film, if for that alone this would be a unique film. What it does with computer graphics, shows you they aren't just for spaceships and hobbits anymore. The story is real enough to understand, and think about your own memories and hopefully cherish them a bit more, including the \\"bad ones\\". <br />I hope this film will be a classic 20 years down the road.
B0001XWV12|4.0|A good comedy movie. If you like Roadtrip, this would be a great addition to your comedy collection. More of a drama type comedy than a romantic, but its great :) Its worth the money
B00000099Y|5.0|an amazing album, i really give it 4.75 stars while lateralus gets 5 stars. a lot of people dont like tool because they dont take the time to listen to them. tool is progressive rock, it has to grow on you slowly. it took me a while to get into aenema but it was worth it. third eye, best song.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Led Zeppelin's How The West Was Won is a live complination from their 1972 Long Beach/LA shows. This is Led Zeppelin at their best. I love how they included a live recording of Dancing Days from their 1972 performence. I also really enjoy the endless 20 minute jams including Dazed And Confused, Whole Lotta Love, and Bring It On Home. Their is also a nice acoustic set including Going To California, Thats The Way, Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp. The sound quality is very clean worth a good performence. I also enjoyed them playing their early songs like the Immigrant Song, and Heartbreaker. This live recordings is Highly Recomened!
B00028HBKC|5.0|For all of you Catholics who have followed the Homily during Palm Sunday and to all who follow the Christian tradition, we quickly realize how historically and Biblically accurate Mel Gibson's Passion really was when we followed up with the readings during the high holy days. He should be commended for backing it with his money, his faith, his direction, and his heart. It was amazing! It was intellectually stimulating and certainly questioned the faith of all of His people,that would include the Romans and the Jews who seem to be pointing fingers throughout history over who killed Jesus. The point was, He was meant to die to give us all life ever after. Controversy only sold more tickets. This was surely the best movie of last year and perhaps one of the best ever made. The only finger pointing that should take place will be at the academy if this does not win best picture, best actor and best director at the Academy Awards. This is a must see for everyone!
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|**1/2 \\"Gothika\\" is pure horror movie hokum from writer Sebastian Gutierrez and director Mathieu Kassovitz.  In it, Halle Berry plays a psychologist who finds herself a patient at the very same Institution for the Criminally Insane where she works after she becomes the prime suspect in the grizzly murder of her husband, a director at the hospital.  The film has some fun with the idea of a doctor having to experience life from the other side of the psychiatric couch, trying to convince the very medical establishment she was once a part of that she is not a raving lunatic.  Indeed, the film is at its most intriguing when it is preoccupied with the irony of its setup, and at its least compelling when it is focused on the silliness of its supernatural elements (which I will not iterate here).  Where \\"Gothika\\" falls down is in its strained, convoluted plotting and its over-reliance on horror movie conventions and clich&eacute;s - i.e. cued-up thunderstorms, false scares, neck-snapping plot twists.  The whole avenging-spirit premise has been exploited to a fare-thee-well in movies of late, and \\"Gothika\\" brings nothing new to the theme.<br /><br />Berry delivers a one-note performance of sustained shrill hysteria throughout, while Robert Downey Jr. is largely wasted in the role of a fellow psychologist who may or may not have Berry's best interests at heart.<br /><br />The film is, I suppose, an acceptable Guilty Pleasure for those dark stormy nights when nothing but a cheesy, over-the-top thriller will do, but don't expect to remember it much past the scrawling closing credits.
B000001AJG|5.0|I bought this when  the LP came out because  it had been touted as the first  'all Digital'  creation(This was before the CD format was available). Apparently  Wonder was originally going to record the sound F/X ,such  as the nature sounds,etc. digitally but was so taken by the clarity of the recordings ,that he started over, re-recording the entire album on a digital recorder.

0689859368|4.0|I bought this book to read to my children and fell in love with it myself.  While it does have some similarity to Lemony Snickett, I found it to be a fine book and quickly bought the second.  The illustrations are wonderful and I loved the old fashioned feel to it.  The one shortcoming is that each book is far too short.  I feel that there could have been more depth and detail.
1582403589|4.0|A great series that explores human nature and is sometimes a scathing commentary of the frivolousness of modern life and what we call civilization.  Depressing at times, it is also very uplifting at others.  The only real flaw with The Walking Dead is how dreadfully transparent the storylines are and now much influence it draws on modern zombie movies such as 28 Days Later...  The smooth, clean artwork is also to be noted.
B00005JNEI|5.0|I'm actualy a 16 teenager from Mxico that sliped in the movie booth to see this polemic film. <br />I was amazed, of how a goverment with that power could get as low as attacking it's own country and atack another with no reason... <br />Here in the frontier we can get a load of the things that happens here and there and with really more info that the CNN can bring. <br />The movie starts with the complot of making Bush win the 2000 election with curiously a percent more than his oponent, Al Gore, I was even seeing this moment by Fox6, Al Gore was winning, but somehow the results \\"magicaly\\" change to Bush's favor. <br />Next thing on the movie is how the president really knew what was going to happen, even his dad knew what was going to happen on that infernous 9/11. <br />Here in Mexico, where the news aren't censored as US's are, we could even see the real reasons for the \\"terrorist atack\\" (wich I guess is a grove now) and that only here most of the americans realized 3 years later on the movie. <br />If you're Republicant of heart, first see the movie... then start givin' your opinion. This movie was not made to make an scandal (well, It did, so what?), I'ts actually a way to see the truth behind the goverment that's going to \\"save the world from destruccion, and give peace to all the nations\\" <br />

031218087X|3.0|While teaching school in New Hampshire, author Dan Brown received a surprising visit by the US Secret Service.  They were investigating a student who sent an email saying the President should be shot.  Afterward, Brown wanted to know how the Secret Service knew what people were saying in their emails.  His investigation pointed him to the National Security Agency and their methods for collecting intelligence information; this investigation became the premise for \\"Digital Fortress\\". <br /> <br />Brown's modern day Big Brother scenario pits an ex-NSA computer privacy genius against his former employer and their gigantic code-breaking super computer.  Programmer Ensei Tankado has created an unbreakable encryption system which would make NSA's code breaking computer obsolete, allow people to communicate freely over the internet, and would threaten the national security of the US.  This battle crosses the globe going to Spain, Japan, and the internal compound in the NSA's Fort Meade complex as well as the inner workings of the characters' psyches.  Throughout the book unintended consequences make this battle more intense and may eventually lead to NSA's downfall. <br /> <br />Brown's fresh and intriguing argument between personal privacy rights and national security starts powerfully but meanders slightly through the middle of the book.  He waters down the generally plausible technical plotlines with flawed characters and suspect situations.  A number of surprising twists entices you to read on but looses steam as the book progresses.  I did find Brown's webpage valuable and has a number of links and interesting information regarding the subject.  Go to WWW.DAN.BROWN.COM if you would like to see more from his personal site. <br /> <br />A quick, cerebral, and enjoyable read but ends predictably.  I don't want to give away the ending so I'll end my review by saying I give the book \\"3\\" stars. <br />  <br />A worthwhile read.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I frankly don't know how anybody could dislike this film.  I cannot think of many superior cinemagraphic experiences than viewing \\"The Passion of the Chirst.\\"  With the soldiers and the Pharisees, it is nearly unfathomable that such hate could be conjured up for one's fellow human beings but there are endless reminders around us today which document that such hate still exists.  Christ in particular remains despised in numerous hearts and locales.<br /><br />The artistic merits of \\"The Passion...\\" are weighty.  Merely hearing Aramaic and Latin for two hours straight is valuable in itself.  All of the acting is strong and this is even true of the minor roles as one's outrage at the individual soldiers is palpable.<br /><br />The choice for Satan was fascinating as I don't recall ever seeing a more perfectly androgynous human being captured on the big screen.  The way that Mel Gibson \\"fleshed out\\" Pilate was stupendous, and quite surprising.  In the context of the times, it is possible to feel sympathy for him.  The very small things are what makes the film uniquely memorable, such as the use of flashbacks, the motif of the dove, and the death scene of Judas.  I loved this movie and the DVD was worth the 20 bucks I paid.  Never in my life have I wanted more to more change an ending and never in my life have I been as powerless to do so.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I grew up loving Star Wars and I, like so many others from my generation, had all the toys. This film is the one that made science fiction real. It was a simple movie. Instead of dealing with social issues like the Star Trek series, these movies were more concerned with real characters and good and evil. Everything about Star Wars was cool because it was new at the time. Han Solo was cool! Darth Vader was cool! The fights in space were cool!  <br /> <br />Even after all the years the original two films hold a sentimental value. I remember watching these films in awe because special effects and the look of these films were on a different level than anything before it. That's why I don't think the series carries the same weight with the new generation of kids. The effects don't hold the novelty to them. If you look at the original films now you'd surely see television series have slicker effects. The story still holds up because of the characters, but George Lucas now seems to hold a much greater fascination for effects, plot, and profitability than he does characters. This tendency can be seen in Return of the Jedi when the best they could come up with is the Empire rebuilding the Death Star. Where's the originality? Ewoks to sell dolls to girls since he cornered the action figure sales to boys. And how many versions of this movie have been released on video and laserdisc? Too many to count. Now we have the first release on DVD.  <br /> <br />My expectations were low for the new trilogy because I saw the decline in George Lucas's interest in the franchise and I still believe his heart is not truly in it. Maybe he's doing it because he's bored? If you want to see George Lucas at his best look to his early work, THX 1138, American Graffiti, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Empire Strikes Back. These are the films that he should be known for. I hold out hope for the third installment of the new series. It definitely has the potential to be the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" of the prequel trilogy. I mean the way we know it ends is Darth Vader coming to power and the dark side prevailing. How can George miss with this film?  <br /> <br />In regards to not releasing the original versions of the films, just be patient. Anyone that pays attention knows how Lucasfilms has been releasing multiple versions of the same movie knowing that all the fans will shell out another $50 bucks for it when he's ready. Much like Miramax and Tarrentino are doing with Kill Bill. Do the enhanced versions really make that big of a difference to me enjoying the films, no. I think the best part of the first two movies are the stories themselves and if the effects are a little better then so be it. Lucas hasn't done anything in the new versions that really hurts the story has he?  <br /> <br />I just wish I could just buy the first two installments and leave the horrible third installment on the store's shelf. I probably will next year or the year after that when they release the films individually.     <br />
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Forget what the few negative reviews out there say.  Donnie Darko is a genre-hopping, mindblowing masterpiece.  There's just so much metaphor, story, and symbolism here that you can't wrap your head around it after one sitting.  The story is brilliant, although it isn't spoon fed to you.  Like events in real life, where connections aren't always so clear, what's really going on in Donnie Darko isn't obvious the first time around.  That's what's so great about it!  Unless you're one of the many people out there who hate to think, watch this movie! <br /> <br />One caveat:  I spent nearly 20 minutes in Barnes and Noble trying to find this DVD.  Because it hops genres, I was looking all over the place.  I found that it was shelved under \\"drama.\\"
B00028HBKM|3.0|After hearing reviews about this film being antisemtic, I have to disagree.  As well, I didn't find it nearly as gory as I thought it would be.  It is Roman soldiers who cane Jesus, who scourge him, who beat him, insult him, spit on him, press a crown of thorns onto his head and crucify him, all on the orders of a Roman procurator. And nobody in their right mind would ever accuse the film of being anti-Italian, just as I have never heard anyone accusing, say, Schindler's List of being anti-German.<br /><br />There were no 'surprises' since this is an old story that people already know  - Jesus is arrested, accused, not necessarily found guilty but sentenced by the people anyhow, beaten, then given a cross to drag up a hill where he is to be crucified. Once there he is nailed to the cross, and shortly thereafter, he dies. His body is taken down, put in a mausoleum, and the next morning, he is risen. End of story. That's it.

B00008972S|5.0|When a film is based on a Broadway musical, usually a number of changes have to be made, and people who saw the work on stage feel that the film version loses its integrity. \\"West Side Story\\" is one Broadway musical that is often considered an exception to this rule and seems better on film. While the film's version of the work is able to capture all of New York, this is not the only reason for the film's success. Some of the musical numbers are rearranged and slightly rewritten which makes the film version flow a bit better than the stage production. Even though MGM's Golden Days of Musicals had long ended when \\"West Side Story\\" was filmed, we see the former glory of this great studio in this film.<br /><br />The film has some of Hollywood's greats including the young Natalie Wood as Maria (a lip-syncing Maria, but that's no problem) and Rita Moreno as Anita. The singing is great, the dancing leaves a viewer spellbound, and the story is timeless. While we know we are in 1950's NYC, it could happen today. It is no wonder that both the film and the stage production are revered by so many. It is a great film and deserves its rightful place in film history.<br /><br />For people considering purchasing this DVD set, the collector's edition is well worth the price. Viewers can see the movie as it would have originally aired in movie theatres, complete with intermission music, see behind the scenes tidbits, and get a commemorative book filled with photographs and interesting information.
0553210246|3.0|I had never been so against reading a book in my life.  Everything about it seemed boring; the cover, the title, and even the way the pages smelled.  It was only the fact that Henchard sells his wife and baby in an auction; that kept my interest alive.<br /><br /> Even with a premise as weird as this one, the book's beginning was painful.  It wasn't until later on that I discovered the book wouldn't be as painful as I feared.  The Mayor of Casterbridge is based entirely on irony and coincidences.  Never have I rolled my eyes so many times in disbelief.<br /><br /> Hardy created a soap opera-like world in the town of Casterbridge.  This actually gave a humorous appeal to the book.  After every major section of the book you can't help but mumble, \\"Sure...\\"<br /><br /> Some people deem this book, \\"Depressing,\\" however The Mayor of Casterbridge didn't once give me a similar feeling.  This book is presented in such a way that it helps you laugh at other people's misfortune.<br /><br /> I wouldn't recommend this book as a \\"free-read;\\" But if you must choose between a bunch of boring books, and this one happens to be on the list, then I highly recommend you choose it. It may seem boring at first, but give it a chance; Hardy's humorous look at tragedy will give you a good laugh. I mean how bad can a book be, that starts out with its central character actually selling his wife and baby girl at a fair?
0060930349|5.0|I recently decided to brush up on my American history. I knew one of the books was going to be Howard Zinn's 'History of the American People.' Standing in the bookstore with little to guide me, I chose Johnson's book as my antidote to what I knew would be Zinn's overdose of problems. Having finished both books, I am a newly invigorated American. Zinn does a good job of pointing out everything that is wrong with this country. Everyone should read his book carefully (I am not being facetious - it is important to know this stuff). Johnson (a Brit, by the way) does an even better job of pointing out how and why the real people of America (the ones Zinn has a hard time acknowledging) are 'strong, outspoken, intense in their convictions, sometimes wrong-headed but always generous and brave, with a passion for justice no nation has ever matched.' <br /> <br />Those of us who want to be familiar with our country's history, but do not have time to read everything that has been written about it, are well served by these two books. We have inherited a wonderful country. There is much to do to make it better. But there is every reason to believe we will continue to make progress in the future, if we are reasonably familiar with the mistakes we have made in the past.

B000002GK1|5.0|From time to time you'll get into the usual squabble about what defines Heavy Metal and what defines Hard Rock.  \\"Ohh if there are no solos it's not Heavy Metal, but Hard Rock.\\"  \\"Ohh if they don't scream it's not Heavy Metal, but Hard Rock.\\"  Now I ask the casual listener to take a gander at this here album and pop the unusal looking CD into the CD case and turn the volume up.  If this album doesn't hit you in the face at a 100 mph and then some, you need to get your nuts zapped or something to wake the \\"F\\" up.  The solos are there, the wonderful yells of Chris Cornell are there.  This album came out of the grunge capitol of the world and whooped up on San Francisco and The Black Album, took a sharp turn and whooped up on Cowboys From Hell, then when straight up to the Big Apple's neighbor and whooped up Horrorscope.  Yeah, this album is as heavy as those afformentioned ones and just kicks the crap out of them with the slight possible exception for Horrorscope.  Heavy Metal?  YES  Hard Rock?  YES.  Kickass album that you should own?  HELL YES.
B000059XUT|4.0|This is one of the best pixar movies. It's fun, entertaining, and usally out of stock for that matter! It beats Finding Nemo which was funny, but  had kids calling clownfishes Nemo at the aquarium. This movie is about a group of talking toys who have to move with thier owner, Andy, andwhen Andy gets a new toy, Buzz lightyear, Woody gets jealous. He ends up having to team up with Buzz to go get o n the moving truck to not be left behind!
B000063WDH|5.0|The Big Come Up is it. The Keys' first LP, and some say their best. They combine garage rock and hardcore blues for a sound that just resonates with ache. With absolutely no image, the Black Keys, obviously not doing it for the money, just play all of themselves into the music that we hear, and there isn't one single song on this album that doesn't show it. Words can't even describe the feeling that goes over me when I hear this music. I fall into another dimension, float away from my suburban youth self, and fall into bluesy-rock. I had this album in my CD player for more than a month and couldn't stop listening to it. (I bought several albums that month that didn't recieve very much playtime.) The Keys just have this effect on you. This is a must have for anyone who listens to... well, music. If you don't own it already, I would probably give you the money right out of my wallet so you could buy it. It's just that good. (And try to get any other rock duos out of your head. The Black Keys have absolutely nothing to do with them. They don't look like them. They don't sound like them. Why? Because they are The Black Keys.)
B000085RTZ|5.0|This is a well-crafted album that moves seamlessly and artistically through a variety of musical modes.  Even at its heaviest, Epica is constructed of excellent melodies, and will never be mistaken for sheer noise.  The album is supported well percussively, Khan's singing is awesome, and the female vocals are moving and well-placed.  \\"Center of the Universe\\" catches a groove and demands replaying - except that you must press on with the rest of the album.  The classical depth is just right - not overdone, but finely contributes to an integral whole.  By metal concept album standards, the songwriting is very strong as well.  This is my first exposure to Kamelot, and I'm hooked.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I found this to be a moving and powerful film.  Mel Gibson has made a film that shows us just a portion of what Christ suffered for mankind.  (It is important to remember that the word passion has a root that means suffering.)  If you don't believe or don't know the story the violence might be all you can see.  However, I saw Jesus reaching out with love, trying to teach, through all the torture and barbarity even while on the cross.  Tears come easily while watching this film because I know my sins put the whips and hammers in my hands and that Jesus was wounded for my transgressions, bruised for my iniquities, and that with his stripes I am healed.<br /><br />James Caviezel certainly portrays the suffering of Jesus, but more importantly he also always projects the absolute submission Jesus has to God's will and his boundless love for every human.  I particularly loved the scene where the man who had been compelled to carry Christ's cross to Golgotha looks into the eyes of Jesus and is tormented because of the love Christ still radiates.  I remember one of the negative reviewers said that the words of Christ asking his Father to forgive his tormenters (us) were not in the film.  That is wrong.  They are in there twice, when he is being nailed to the cross on the ground and another time shortly before he dies.<br /><br />The other actors are fine as well.  Hristo Shopov was very fine as Pontius Pilate as was Claudia Gerini as Pilate's troubled wife.  Monica Bellucci adds a haunting beauty as Mary Magdalene.  However, top honors goes to Maia Morgenstern as Mary.  She brings Mary to life as I have never seen before.  And when she looks straight in our eyes as she holds the broken body of her son you know she is not condemning us.  No, she is asking us to understand what her son (and she) gave for us and asks us to accept that sacrifice and let it change our lives.<br /><br />The actors who played the priests, the vicious Roman guards, and the crowds who called for Jesus' death should all be commended for powerfully playing those thankless roles.  They contributed so much to the film in such a difficult roles that I just want to say thank you to them.commended for powerfully playing those thankless roles.  They contributed so much to the film in such a difficult roles that I just want to say thank you to them.
B000002J09|5.0|This review is directed towards a certain Greg Dilmore, (miami, fl) whose review completely baffled me at hearing the words, \\"Jimi Page's guitar work doesn't impress me at all.\\" First off, if you intend to insult a piece of music that has been greatly treasured in rock and roll history, and still continues to do so today (by most), then at least spell the artist's name right. Correction: Since you didn't take the time to do so before, figure it out for yourself. Secondly, the choice to have a #1 one song during the 60's on a car commercial is that car dealerships choice, therefore, having nothing to do with the composure of the music. If anything, I would say it was a compliment because the song is so well-known and loved (once again, release yourself from the majority votes), then it would increase the sales by much. These reviews are made up of only opinions of the individual, of course, but please pay attention to all of them, and then make your decision yourself.
0385720920|5.0|If it wasnt for choke, I would not be reading today. Chuck has single handily opened me up to a world of authors who don't write conventional stories. If you are looking for something that isn't quite the norm, then this is it.
0743243315|5.0|This book is carefully crafted and tells the story of the evolution of a Bangladeshi woman who comes to a foreign city to live with her arranged husband, Chanu. It is the story of the liberation and strength of this woman, Nazneen, as she grows out of a childhood dominated by the concept of unmovable \\"fate\\" determining all action. As Nazneen evolves and begins to think for herself, she sees that she can take on \\"fate\\" and create her own perceptions, think her own ideas, feel her own feelings, and stand up to the powerful grinding forces that are always ready to ensnare her. Because her husband is \\"kind\\" and does not beat her, she is able to have moments of autonomy. She meets Karim, a young rebel who brings her work in the form of clothing to be sewn. They have a forbidden love affair. Her two daughters are perfectly drawn: the older westernized and cocky, the younger tense and insecure. And her husband is so well constructed as a character that you understand exactly what makes him tick. He is a multifaceted character, representing the immigrant experience in all its bluster and frustration and self-deceit. All this takes place in the backdrop of 9/11 and the Bangladeshi community in London, seemingly authentically described in depressing and rich detail.<br /><br />This book required my patience, as its pace is sometimes slow.  But Monica Ali is a keen observer, and although at times she can overwrite and be carried away by her poetic rhetoric, she rewards the reader often with sharp images and perceptive character analysis. By the end of this book, I was convinced it was well worth the effort. The liberation of women is a worldwide movement, not just a western one, and this book chronicles its dramas, its agonies, and its triumphs. I highly recommend it.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|I can't remember exactly what prompted me to buy this DVD, but it its first five minutes left quite an impression.  For those who have seen it, that is, of course, \\"The Speech\\".  For medical reasons beyond my control, I was not able to stay in the Army (15 Oct 1997 -- 15 Jan 1998, MOS 11M [would-be]), but those first few minutes made me want to jump back in and kill every damned terrorist on this planet, because everything he said about the \\"Hun\\" could be said about fighting the \\"Arab\\" and the \\"Persian\\" equally. <br /> <br />The last line of the speech proper, the visualization of his troops' firesides 30 years from now, is quite possibly the most important line of the film.  It gives a view, albeit only  microscopic, of his command of history, and how he lived, ate, slept, and breathed the history of his profession, and was able to understand the propensity of the occasion as it was happening. <br /> <br />The only other two parts that compete with it also lift, for a few short moments, the veil of the past.  <br /> <br />The first is the scene at what I would guess Patton and Bradley were at Zama (among the runins after Patton orders the driver off the beaten path), where the Roman Scipio Africanus beat the more famous Hannibal, in what was probably the most important battle for the Romans, republic or empire, where, even though I don't believe in reincarnation, his clearer-than-crystal view of the past makes it hard not to. <br /> <br />The second is the end scene as he walks out in the meadow with \\"Willie\\".  The monologue is so picturesque that, were I to fall asleep during that scene, and I woke up later, I would probably be looking for my sword and fumbling around in my chair looking for the reins of a chariot. <br /> <br />Among the most well-done scenes were those done with Capt. Steiger, the Nazi officer assigned to research Patton.  He, better than anyone except for Scott, conveyed the Patton \\"mystique\\" in this film.  His best scenes were warning Col-General Jodl that Patton would attack Sicily (because the Athenians did in the Peloponnesian War, and the final scene in the command post, where Patton's picture is burned, and he is bid a fond farewell as the \\"Pure Warrior\\".  If this latter scene actually happened somewhere in the doldrums of the Nazi regime, it is pure prophecy, because the absence of war ultimately did kill him inside, to the point that it was almost a good thing that he died when he did, so that his legend was cemented. <br /> <br />While this film was worth the six stars we have bestowed on General Washington, it is not beyond reproach. <br /> <br />Part of the problem is Bradley's influence.  I respect Bradley, and I loved his comment about Monty's proposed \\"dagger thrust\\" (Bradley likened it more to a \\"butter knife thrust\\"), but I don't think that Bradley's and Patton's friendship was always as amicable as is put forth in the show.  Patton's and Ike's relationship was also a bit better than portrayed.  There's also the glaring omission of any discussion about FDR before his death. More than any adverse relationship between Patton and Bradley, I think these scenes were just a matter of Bradley not fully understanding what Patton was about.  As is said in the movie, Bradley does his job because he is trained to do it; Patton does his because he loves it (l'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace!).  That one was probably correct, and a good explanation. <br /> <br />The only thing that angered me about the movie was that, at times, Patton is portrayed as a micromanager or a figurehead.  The most glaring display of this, is his return out of the doghouse, before he gets 3rd Army, and he is shown just riding around in a jeep, with a big grin on his face; he was much more than that. <br /> <br />Any who have had the honor of knowing a former 3rd Army soldier, or even one from  II Corps or 7th Army, know that other soldiers will give their unit, whereas soldiers in those Armies or that Corps, when Patton commanded, will almost invariably say \\"I was with Patton.\\"  Not only that, on the way to a church service project one time, I was reading a summary of 20 decisive battles, and that morphed into a conversation where one of my friends said the same exact words...about his uncle.  Patton's influence is one that will be felt long after we have gone the way of the dodo bird, and no general that just sits in a jeep can have that kind of effect. <br /> <br />The only glaring inaccuracy in the film is at the speech.  No, the editing of the language was done for the general public; he generally would only cuss profusely in front of his troops.  He was only a Lieutenant General (3 stars) at the time of \\"The Speech.\\" <br /> <br />Other than these slight criticisms, it is a perfect movie.  The music, especially the theme music, is also perfect.  Again, six stars.
B000002JSP|5.0|Very few are rock legends.  Led Zepplin managed to achieve this.  If you span their entire career you may find three songs that you wouldn't like.  They are one of the greatest (if not the greatest) rock bands ever assembled.  Pages songwriting abillities are uncanny.  In my opinion they are the most versitile rock band ever.  I don't understand how you can say the guitar work from the earlier albums is better.  Unless you don't know anything about guitar.  The layering on this album is increddible.  \\"All of my love\\" is one of my favorite zepplin songs.  \\"In the evening\\" and \\"Fool in the rain\\" are great.  As well as the ragtime rock of \\"South bound suarez\\" None of the songs are bad at all.  This albums solid.  In my opinion this and \\"presence\\" are page's least sloppy works.  I'm not saying they are the best, But they are still great.

Every page has an interesting story and something to say, but there is nothing connecting all of it.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye isn't the best lyricist in the world so you might be asking yourself why I consider this album a classic.  It's Hip-Hop at its finest that's why.  The beats are amazing, the music is very good, and Kanye is a rapper you can relate to.  Every track on this album could be singles.  Kanye manages to have big named guest appearances and yet none of them outshine West, and actually feel like guests unlike most albums.  \\"We Don't Care\\" is a cool rebellion song, especially the last verse.  \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Never Let Me Down\\" are more spiritual songs, while \\"Slow Jamz\\", \\"Breathe In, Breathe Out\\", and \\"The New Workout Plan\\" are more party type tracks.  \\"Family Business\\" is a good, sweet song about family and \\"Last Call\\" is a song dedicated to Roc-A-Fella Records for everything they did for him.  \\"Spaceship\\" is a magnificent story-telling song about what desperate people do to escape their dull lives.  \\"All Falls Down\\" is a cool, acoustic song about I don't know what and \\"Through The Wire\\" is the infamous song about pain and triumph.   <br /> <br />Basically, I'm telling you right now, if you say you appreciate Hip-Hop and don't have this album, then you don't appreciate Hip-Hop because this is simply a classic Hip-Hop record, given to us in a time when Hip-Pop runs the radio stations.   <br /> <br />A CLASSIC!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|According to slipknot it is. <br />Hmmm....this is slipknot? They stated that before you listen to this cd it is advisable to `forget everything you know' about them. Is that a good thing? I mean we all loved their old stlye of music right?  <br /> <br />Uh...no. As much as I liked their self-titled, I found that Iowa was just too heavy. Yes you heard it. Before all `true' metal fans start twitching, I don't mean good heavy like `Norther': Death Unlimited. I mean a constant heaviness with no change of pace. Like construction work: after a while, it does your head in and you feel like shooting the builders. Sorry. I live next to a builders yard, it gets to you. Compared to their self-titeld album, Iowa was boring and tedious in some places. Hey even their self-titled had major flaws: badly written lyrics that we've all heard before.  <br /> <br />I decided to buy this album when I heard duality, which is one of my favourite tracks. I was surprised to see that there was no parental advisory sticker.  <br /> <br />A slipknot disc with no swearing? <br /> <br />Looks kind of suspicious if you ask me (people only swear when they cant think of anything better to say - mummy). Well perhaps they couldn't before but they sure as hell have made up for it on this album Talk about thesaurus heaven. The lyrics are a humungous improvement. It proves that you don't have to swear like mad to get your point across, although sometimes I wish Corey would stop trying to sound like a literary genius and just god damn swear...(you know you want to! Haven't you got exasperated yet?) But I guess that was what Iowa was for. <br /> <br />Anyway onto the songs:  <br /> <br />When I heard `nameless' it completely floored me. <br /> <br />Did the backstreet boys pop in at this point?  <br /> <br />What a contradictory song! Well it's the best song on the album if you ask me. This song screams multiple personality disorder. It's the best and it throws everybody off. Heavy heavy heavy! - then insert boy band style singing.......(awww!!!)........ - then heavy heavy heavy - boy band...-... heavy!!!!!!!!!!!. Talk about internal battle (just read the lyrics, he is talking to himself) this song is fantastic!!! I love it. <br /> <br />Onto vermilion I adore this song. It has such a sexy vibe, an awesome bridge and again top-notch lyrics.  <br /> <br />I wasn't to keen on `circle' but it has grown on me and I love the kooky ending. If Corey crooning away isn't kooky enough that is... <br /> <br />Vermillion part two is an improvement in this acoustic experiment of his. It's such a sad song. Having an imaginary girlfriend can't be healthy.  <br /> <br />I don't like the virus of life, its too creepy for me. Serial killers are too much of a real threat to make it enjoyable. The point were he breaths: \\"I wanna wear your face, I wanna burn your soul\\" scares me. Although I love the film conair (gotta love malkovich and cage together), with that wacky serial killer Garland Greene (after getting fired, he butchered the entire company that he worked for and drove through two states wearing a girls head as a hat) was my favourite character. I guess I'm a bit of a contradiction.  <br /> <br />Any way! Back to the review...if you can call it that. This cd is their best yet. Bands have to evolve to survive you know. Corey can't stay mad at the world forever. Making another record of pure rage must of seemed wrong to him .Not to mention he'd be lying to himself. There's nothing worse then an album that sounds forced and fake. I think he got most of it out on Iowa. If you are a fan then respect the path he has taken. It was a big risk for slipknot to release something like this and by the looks of some reviews they have already lost a number of fans. But hopefully gained some new ones.  <br /> <br />This music is what the band wanted to make. Respect their choice and either enjoy it for what it is (slipknots truest form) or move on.  <br /> <br />And to all the purists out there who think this is a disgrace to metal, I prefer this to Iron Maiden any day. But seventh son of the seventh son rocks all the same. <br /> <br />PS:I heard somewhere that Corey has been sober for 10 months; I take my hat off to him. Not that I have one, its just to hot in Tenerife you see...sends you crazy after a while.... <br /> <br />  <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Do you or have you enjoyed at any time in the past science fiction, westerns, comedies, or any other genre of movie or TV show? Do you own a DVD player or computer with a DVD drive or have the means to purchase one of the above in the near future? If you answered yes to either of the above, then Firefly's the show for you. <br /> <br />Even though it never made it past 14 episodes, the scale of emotions dealt with by these 14 episodes is immense: laughter, despair, terror, relief, acceptance. There has never been and may never be another show like it. I've watched no episode less than about half a dozen times, and each time I appreciate more and more the mastery of the screen that is contained within. <br /> <br />Small touches make this a much more believable and less sanitized universe than that of Star Trek. Coloquialisms change with time, this is the only show set in the future that I've ever seen where the English language has actually changed since the present day - words that would be commonly used by those living and working among the stars are shortened. Universe becomes 'verse, atmosphere becomes atmo, that sort of thing. They also always refer to the Earth as \\"Earth that was\\" - there is not explanation as to exactly what happened to the Earth, but it is certainly no cliché alien attack - there is no such thing in this universe, making it a refreshing change from the constant theme of strained diplomacy with people with bumpy foreheads. <br /> <br />If you're hooked on the idea and are disappointed by its cancellation, take heart that there's a movie coming out April 22, 2005, called Serenity, that tells the story as it was going to be told before being interrupted. You can check it out over at [...] <br /> <br />In all, Firefly is a breath of fresh air in an industry where the top brass considers the route to success is to say to their writers, \\"we need a script like the one we released last year, but this time instead of aliens they'll be fighting a rogue human faction\\" or something along those lines. So - let the rip-offs begin!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I personally do not like the song \\"No Such Thing\\" and never have. When I first heard of JM I HATED HATED HATED him because I thought he was the first thing out there the record company could find to have another version of Dave Matthews. But Three years after I first heard No Such Thing and Hating John Mayer I saw a special on TV where he played his other songs and really played the gutiar. I love every song he has ever played except No Such Thing. He might sound like Dave but his lyrics are more down to earth and he is a madman on guitar. I now love John Mayer more than any other artist out there and own all of his CD's and I cannot stop listening to them ALL the time. The only reason I would say not to buy his CD is if you want to prevent yourself from having a new addiction.
0060730552|4.0|I picked up this book because Oprah Winfrey recommended it.  By the way, Oprah has done more than many educators have for literacy and good reading than anybody in this country.   <br />This is a true mountain adventure set in the Peruvian Andes.  The two climbers are skilled and courageous.  The book is well-written, with vivid details and a life-and-death ethical dilemma at its center.  How Joe Simpson pushed himself past the limits of endurance is compelling.  My only disappointment is that he failed to see the hand of God in his deliverance.
B000089RVX|3.0|I admit.  I loved this CD the first time I heard it.  It was in my player constantly.  But then, I'd never been exposed to any of the more talented bands that don't get the airplay that this one-hit wonder got.  So... all I have to do to become a big name is stuff a hot girl in front of the mic, play painfully simple guitar riffs, tap my fingers against a drumset, throw away my bass guitar, and program so much synthesizer ambience that you think there's an orchestra playing in the background?  Wow, time to get started! <br /> <br />Okay, so Evanescence isn't (or should I say, wasn't) bad.  There are just better bands out there.  I tend to think most female-fronted metal bands (yes, I'm talking about Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, and Within Temptation here) lose their lustre when the novelty of a female vocalist wears off... okay, so Within Temptation did nothing for me from the start, but that's an exception.  Anyway, the problem with female-fronted bands, and Evanescence is the perfect example, is that too much emphasis is placed upon the vocalist.  I will say that Amy Lee has the POTENTIAL to be a great vocalist... if she'd start singing and quit crying.  I would recommend the darkwave duo Dargaard to anyone who likes Amy's voice.  Their singer, Elisabeth Torsier, sounds alarmingly similar to Amy Lee, except she actually sings.  No emoting, no sobbing, no nonsense.  Another thing:  the lyrics are pitifully cliche.  I mean, whoever thought of singing eleven songs about mental decay and suicide?  Oh yeah, I forgot \\"Imaginary\\"... Evanescence's way of saying \\"I like to get high.\\"  Did they honestly think anyone wouldn't get the 'subliminal' message?  But seriously, mainstream bands tend to stick to topics like this that have no significance and are mortally overdone.  Now on to the instrumentals.  Ben Moody was hailed as the mastermind behind this band.  What did he do?  He played the same riff in every song!  Take away the synths and Amy's voice and every song sounds exactly the same!  Same tempo, same measures, same everything!  I don't even thing the other guitarist played anything, except the rhythm that one time that Ben did a \\"solo\\" (which was pitiful, by the way).  And WHERE WAS THE BASS???  Any bass that was in there must've been programmed because it sounded like farts.  And then my favorite... Rocky Gray.  How dare he call himself a drummer?  Tapping your sticks against the kit does NOT constitute drumming.  He played the same \\"beat\\" in every song, sort of like Ben did with the guitar.  I guess if you like all your music to sound the same, then you'll love Fallen. <br /> <br />So what is the verdict?  They had potential, but like countless other mainstream bands, they failed to explore it.  This is unusual, because Amy seems more like the artistic type than one who is just out to make money.  The reason I give this thing 3 stars is because the synth ambience fits the songs very well, and despite her crying, Amy does have a good voice.  However, if you really like female-fronted metal, I think you should invest in some music by Leaves' Eyes and After Forever.  Those bands not only have incredible female singers, but have musicians who actually know how to play their instruments and make songs that sound different from the previous track.  If you are into gothic metal (which this does seem to fit into, at least a lot more than Lacuna Coil), I cannot say this enough:  Moonspell.  So what is going to happen with the remnants of Evanescence?  Well, hopefully Rocky will go back to playing in Christian \\"death metal\\" bands, Ben will learn how to play a new riff, and Amy will find a new band and push her talents a little further.  This was not a bad buy, but there is better music out there.
B0002858YS|4.0|Everything old is new again! Obviously children of the 80s, The Killers have made a varied, thoroughly enjoyable album that wears its influences on its sleeve. <br /> <br />The opening track, \\"Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine\\", handily answers the question \\"What would happen if the Afghan Whigs made a single with Duran Duran?\\". Kinda angry, kinda rockin, with a pulsing bass line... wouldn't sound out of place on either \\"Gentlemen\\" or \\"Rio\\". <br />The album hits an early peak, in my opinion, with \\"Mr. Brightside\\".  A terrific, if somewhat insipid, song of longing and jealousy that every guy can relate to. This track not only gives a nod to Nena \\"..open up my eager eyes..\\" over soaring Mike  & The Mechanics keyboards, but I'd swear I hear Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" in the bridge... sounds great played loud and sung along with in your car. <br />\\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" sounds awfully familiar too, but I can't quite put my finger on it. And I'm sure you've heard \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and formed your own opinion. \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" slows it down a bit, but still keeps things moving over rolling drums, chiming guitars and even a choir. The next two tracks sound to me like \\"Head On The Door\\"-era Cure, with \\"On Top\\" having a Yaz-tastic underlying synth line. <br />Practically a tribute song, \\"Change Your Mind\\" sounds for all the world like an upbeat Morrisey cover. Guitar and synth driven, with smoothly delivered, clever lyrics that could be the Mozzer himself. <br /> <br />And there's more. Every time I play this disc it reminds me of some band or song I loved. If you like the radio single, and '80s alterna-pop in general, you won't want to miss this CD.
B00009027B|5.0|First of all, I must say I love the title.  Second, the music, as with most of My Dying Bride's work, is phenomenal.  Even though I've always felt that Aaron Stainthorpe was the bane of MDB, he can't destroy their masterful works.  The opening track, \\"The Cry of Mankind,\\" is one of my favorite MDB songs ever.  The only complaint I have with this album is the live tracks.  They were a nice addition, but they don't sound quite that good.  Anyway, I recommend The Angel and the Dark River to any fan of good dark metal.
B00004XPP0|5.0|In my opinion, the Return Of The Jedi, where Darth Vader fights Luke Skywalker is the best one, but all 3 of them are pretty neat.
B0001AP12G|5.0|\\"The College Dropout\\" is one of the best hip-hop albums I've heard in a long time. Kanye has hot beats, along with hot lyrics. The production on this album is truly amazing. It's hard to find a really good mix of good production and lyrics on an album that really works with the rapper's flow, and Kanye West has that. The songs are fun; some with deep meanings and some just for fun. Which is a good mix. It's a great LP from begining to end. Every song on his CD is enjoyable, no skipping needed.
B000003TA4|3.0|As glossed-up as it may be, Nevermind isn't one of my favorite Nirvana albums. There's nothing wrong with it, though. I just don't like how there aren't any textured walls of layered sound or bizarro experimentation on this album. I'm more of an Incesticidal fan, if that makes any sense. I love Nirvana's early material best, but In Utero suits me just as well. Be that as it may, my favorite songs on here are \\"Lithium\\", \\"Breed\\", \\"Territorial Pissings\\"... and I just can't help myself... \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\". Yeah, you know you like it too. Even a seasoned Nirvana fan like myself cannot lie about that one. BUT, I'll take \\"Hairspray Queen\\" and \\"Big Long Now\\" over \\"Teen Spirit\\" anyday. If you must get a Nirvana album, start with Incesticide; it features the band's accessible songs along with their earlier rough, quirky ones. <br /> <br /> <br />

B000001A3H|5.0|[NOTE: This is mostly just a repost. I wanted to correct my original four-star rating since this is a truly awesome release and definitely worthy of highest marks.]<br /><br />If the members of Blue Cheer had parked their giant Marshall amps in the middle of the Mojave desert during a sandstorm, they would sound something like this. It's oppressively heavy and even FEELS hot; images of being stranded in Death Valley with no water come to mind when I play this disc. In my opinion, Blues For The Red Sun is the pinnacle of Kyuss' criminally neglected output (though Welcome To Sky Valley and swansong When The Circus Leaves Town seriously challenge that assertion).<br /><br />I learned of this band through the spinoff group Queens Of The Stone Age, and figured I would like this. Josh Homme (guitar) and Nick Olivieri (bass) are both present here, but from that point the similarities end. The vocals are handled by John Garcia, who is a much raspier singer than Homme, and Brant Bjork's crashing percussion provides the backbeat. What Kyuss lacks in QOTSA's subtlety and diversity, it more than makes up for in heaviness. Homme's guitar cuts through the bass-heavy sludge and fuzz with some truly inspired playing--there's a standout melody on every track, something that doesn't always come naturally to bands in this genre. It's hard to believe that he was only 19 when this album was recorded, because most guitarists would KILL to play anywhere near Josh's ability.<br /><br />Blues For The Red Sun opens with the collosal Thumb, and then changes gears with the more uptempo anthem Green Machine. Following that are a lot of instrumentals (Molten Universe, Apothecaries' Weight, Catepillar March), the hilarious Thong Song (\\"I hate...slow songs\\"), the sinister Writhe, and the thrashing Allen's Wrench. The centerpiece of the album is the 7 1/2 minute Freedom Run; not much to say, it just RAWKS, as does the rest of this album. The only soft moment comes with the beautiful acoustic interlude Capsized, but it doesn't last long before the electricity and distortion return to beat you down. The closer Mondo Generator (yeah, I know it's not the last song but the last track's an obvious joke) is one of the few tracks I used to think was subpar; now it's one of my favorites. Olivieri's vocals are distorted into an echoey, ghostly scream while the band powerfully rocks out behind him. It's atmospheric, almost creepy.<br /><br />Fans of QOTSA, stoner rock fans, and anyone wanting a heavy, rocking album will definitely find Blues For The Red Sun extremely appealing. Essential, as is the rest of Kyuss's work (barring Wretch).c interlude Capsized, but it doesn't last long before the electricity and distortion return to beat you down.

B00005JMEW|5.0|The first half of Quentin Tarantino's revenge epic is a spectacular exercise in bloody stamina with Uma Thurman giving a great performance as the Bride, who seeks revenge against the man who wrong her. She goes to great lengths to get her man and in this first half of this epic, she goes though everyone and everything to get him. Expect to be shocked and wowed by what will happen on screen when she pursues her quarry, and expect to be dazzled. Hands down, this is Tarantino's best film since Pulp Fiction, and he proves once again to be the pinnacle of modern cinema.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Though the album is titled Mechanical Animals. Marilyn Manson shows more emotions on this albulm that is the last thing from mechanical.This CD is differs in a way from Antichrist Super Star, I think Manson lets more of his true feelings and personal experiences show through in the songs of this album.There's a huge array of love songs on this album, for instance: The Last Day On Earth,Speed Of Pain,Fudamentally Loathsome,and User Friendly.Then there's those fast paced Manson songs we all crave like User Friendly and Post Human.This Album is so Bowie, Dissasociative is like a reincarnation of Bowies Space Oddity.It's a new sound for manson,I think he should be admired for having the bravery to change his sound and being able to always try new things.Even if you don't really care for manson, this might just be the CD that will make you become a fan of his.Everyone should own this CD.It never gets boring and it's a CD you'll want to hear over and over again.
B00005JMUA|5.0|Quentin Tarantino's second half of his epic is a true mark of a master filmmaker at his best. While the first film pays tribute to the highly stylize revenge films of the seventies, the last half pays tribute to the dark and complex films that made the seventies such a celebrated time in cinema.  The story progresses into a moody and complex film about violence, honor and human frailty that is a true treat to behold.  Any other filmmaker would have kept the pace of the first film by adding more violence but Tarantino gives a human aspect to the last half of his epic and makes his over the top characters more human and more complex in order to give the revenge aspect of the film a little more meaning. Uma Thurman once again is great as our heroine who still is after the man who wronged her and David Carradine is great as her nemesis Bill and he adds a funny, touching and yet menacing aspect to his character that makes his demise a real treat to wait for.  This is a real classic in Pulp cinema and Quentin Tarantino cements his mark in cinematic history with this fine epic that will be celebrate for years to come.

B00005JKJA|1.0|Well, I finally saw this movie, and I am yet another person who did not get a single second of it. What happened in this movie? Was it one big dream? I have always thought it would be the biggest cop-out if a director were to make a film full of strange occurrences and crazy characters...and then have someone wake up. \\"Oh, it was all a dream!\\" A convenient way to end a movie when the director himself is probably down to the line and just as confused with what he's done to that point as his audience is going to be. <br /> <br />Congratulations to those who did get the point of this, but to me this is like the modern art piece that consists of paint splashed all over a canvas. My friend looks at it and sees life, love, anger, hate, the world, etc. I see paint. My personal feeling on this movie is that it was splashed together like the canvas...and this time there really is nothing but a whole lot of color. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I felt like the movie was more designed to spark debate for decades rather than create an enjoyable story that blows your mind but makes you feel some kind of emotion; that seems to me the mark of a self-important director with misguided creativity rather than the creator of a great work.
0385512104|3.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time was a captivating read, but the only reason I held on till the end was because I thought something dramatic and life changing was going to happen for the Christopher, the main character.  In my opinion, all the comments that the book was filled with were rather misleading, saying things like \\"Moving...\\" and \\"Pieces of wisdom leap off the page...\\".  I wouldn't go that far.  But it was interesting to read into the life of a little boy who had serious problems, as Christopher did; I really felt for his parents, it would be difficult.  However, I would still recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a quick, different, and interesting read.
B00005JKDR|4.0|I've had the movie for over two years and just got around to viewing it.  Well, it was well worth the wait.  An engaging and hilarious story that appeals to the child in all of us, this is a film for anyone that ever wondered about what lay under the bed or hid in the deep recesses of one's closet.  Creative minds and talented actors come together to make a film comparable to the studio's other offerings such as \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"A Bug's Life\\".  In fact, \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", in my opinion is BETTER than the record-setting \\"Finding Nemo\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, the bonus features don't compliment the film.  Included is a \\"new\\" unfunny short that, thankfully, is just that: SHORT. Interviews with the animators and other production staff show that they are gifted beyond measure but they are a tad BORING and stereotypically GEEKY!

There is a piece in this documentary about a family who loses a son in the war and that piece was the hardest piece for my sister and I to watch because we lost our younger brother in the war.  Seeing this trajedy happen to another family in this documentary has made our entire family draw the line with the Bush Regime.  The hardest part to swallow however is understanding THE TRUTH behind the motives of going to war with Iraq.  The only weapon of mass destruction was $GREED$.
B00028HBKM|2.0|First of all, lets remember that this is only a movie. Mel Gibson isn't God! Criticizing the movie isn't criticizing Jesus Christ. Now, onto the film...I understand that the film is about the last 12 hours of Christ so yes, violence will happen. But to show it in such a gratuitous manner for the ENTIRE film? That was not necessary. There are other ways to tell this story and when you take the violence out of the film, you really don't have a film. Keeping that in mind, this film only caters to those who already know the story of Jesus Christ. If you already believe in your faith, then I don't see the point in watching Jesus beaten to death and crucified. Now, had Mel Gibson chosen to add some extra contents to the DVD and explain his intentions, or add more depth or something, it certainly would have been helpful. So to those of you out there who aren't Christians, if you want to learn about Jesus, go to church, get a bible or find some alternative film or program. I also want to say to parents that I've been watching horror and other \\"R\\" rated films since I was 6 years old and as a 27 year old now, this to me was far more disturbing. Consider that before showing your children this film.

0380002930|1.0|Alright, so now that I have gotten your attention--I know, I just rated this book one star, but you see, I noticed as I was reading reviews that my eyes skipped over all the millions of five star reviews, and went straight to the one stars. I hope I'm not being confusing, but what I am TRYING to say is that I actually love this book, and I just used the whole \\"one star thing\\" to grab the readers' attentions.<br /><br />I have a lot of friends who have blatantly stated that \\"this book it terrible.\\" I hate to have to say this about smart people, but my opinion is that if you don't understand the meaning of this book, you might as well read only for entertainment because you will never be able to understand great literature. Want proof? Just look at the other entire one star reviews. None of them are eloquent. None of them give a good reason as to why it wasn't good (other then the fact that they personally didn't understand it).<br /><br />What IS so great about this book, anyway? I can answer that! First of all, the emotions of the characters are so vivid that you could cry over them. When one of them, Fiver, is seized with fear, you really do care, you really do understand. Each character has so much depth that everything they do is such a \\"them\\" thing to do. I find myself smiling as if watching an old friend when Hazel does this, or Bigwig does that.<br /><br />Another great thing is the fact that they are so definitely rabbits. They don't understand everything that humans understand. They function differently, they fear different things, and Richard Adams so flawlessly portrays this that the reader is almost oblivious at times. You just accept it all and sometimes sit back and marvel at... well... just everything!<br /><br />I could talk and talk all day about this book, but then no one would read my review, so I will stop now. I really hope you have been either: a) convinced to read this book or b) made to feel very guilty for not liking it. All right that is all I have to say. Good day.t is all I have to say. Good day. <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|I normally don't write reviews of movies since I don't go to see many of them because they are usually such nonsensical Hollywood crap. But after reading a couple hundred reviews of this DVD, I couldn't resist adding my two cents. <br />I did see the movie when it first came out, and I bought several copies of the DVD for myself and family members because it is truly a transformational piece of artistry and guidance of how to conduct your life for the short time we get to inhabit the planet. Most of the comments I read did not actually deal with the importance of Gibson's contribution to civilization.  <br />Jesus was an important contributor to the advancement of civilization because he did something that is so rare in human events. He was willing to die for changing a corrupt world and make it more loving, accepting, and inclusive.  Religion has always been a force for good and evil because it is used by those who want to advance their own agenda rather than that of the originator of a particular religion. This is true whether the focus was worshiping fire, water, cows, snakes, a human individual, and many other idols. Humans are different from our fellow apes because we actually try to understand the unknowable of why we are here, and what we should do in guiding us now that we are capable of more than just sitting around a fire cooking the day's catch.  Muhammad's words are used as an excuse for jihad by lunatics who kill randomly and wantonly to advance their view of the Koran to kill any \\"nonbelievers\\". The high priests of the temple of David were threatened by a \\"blasphemer\\" when he pointed out the violation of having money changers in the temple. The high priests in Spain and medieval Europe roasted other \\"blasphemers\\" in violation of the words of the Christ they supposedly worshiped as their God. <br />What Gibson does with his work is to point out that we all have a choice, actually many choices in life, to choose the path of forgiveness and love of our fellow man, regardless of how they have violated any sense of humanity towards our fellow man, or go the way of Rome at the time of Jesus (or Berlin and Moscow in the 30's and 40's). It is really the only thing that makes us different from our ancestors who climbed down from the trees millions of years ago and moved all over the planet. I find it especially telling that those who watch something like the \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" and don't feel a need to write a review about such gratuitous violence can give a one star to a movie which is focused on the horrible suffering of scourging and crucifixion two millennia ago of someone who preached honesty, love, compassion, forgiveness, and inclusiveness when the ruling order of the day was sacrificing goats for signs of divine guidance.  <br />This is one of the real classics of movie making. It is not for the faint of heart, because dying for the sins of your fellow man is a rare event. No other major religion is based upon such a selfless individual. It is why it has transformed the world from one of Conan the barbarian and his predecessors and successors to one where we think of something other than ourselves and our selfish human passions. Of course humans being humans, the forces of evil are on the march, as exemplified by the suicide bombings in Israel, Ossetia, New York, Washington, Bali, Kenya, Tanzania, Yemen, Germany, etc.  <br />Gibson deserves every dime he was rewarded with for reminding us of the transformational nature of the message of Jesus the Jew to mankind. Whether you think of Jesus as the Christ or not, you cannot find a better advocate for all the principles that we take for granted today in the West, including those on the upper West Side or West Hollywood who have never done anything but shoot their mouths off while hundreds of thousands have given their blood and bodies for mankind. Every time I walk among the thousands of crosses in American cemeteries all over Europe, and especially in places like Normandy, where brave young men gave their lives, not for conquest or commercial gain but so that others could be free, I understand their sacrifice and the appropriateness of marking it with the symbol of what Christ did to inspire all of mankind. This movie shows you how it all started and what a magnificent gift of selflessness it was.  <br />

B00028HBKM|5.0|I have to give this movie five stars because it's been quite a while since I had watched a movie that gotten completely in my system and this film did. It was so hard to watch. It literally felt like you were there, watching him be crucified. At times I seriously wanted to turn away but my eyes were glued the whole time. I have to commend Mel Gibson for his bravery. Even though I am not Christian, I have to admit that this film was well done.  <br /> <br />I do have to say that it is not easy to watch. I literally felt drained after watching this film and I do believe that this isn't a movie that I am going to watch again anytime soon. This was an experience. That is so rare in filmmaking today. But along side the feeling of draining, I also felt inspired. I was touched deeply by this film. It was amazing what Jesus went through for others. <br /> <br />Jim Cavavzel (sp) is brilliant as Jesus. He portrayed both the warmth and the compassion that Jesus had for all people. There was something about his presence. The love that he carried in his big brown eyes. As far as being too European, I found he was more realistic than others. I know he was bloodied and beatened but there was something about him that made me want to be near him. <br /> <br />Also as well, I want to point out Rosalinda Celentano's performance as Satan. I found her both frightening but beautiful at the same time. Some of the visuals regarding her deeply disturbed me but I found her fascinating due to the fact she was androgynous. My father could not tell if she was male or female. I'd honestly like to see her in more things. <br /> <br />Another thing that captivated me was the way it was shot and the musical score. It was one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen in terms of cinematography and setting. It felt so authentic. The music was definately moving. It sounds so ethereal and otherworldly but also adding to the film's experience. <br /> <br />But over all, this was a film that was highly brutal,deeply moving, an experience and disturbing all at once.

B000050XEI|4.0|Anya is one of my favorite singers. She has a peaceful and soothing voice. This album is her second album during the past 15 years, which means I was only 3 years old at the time she released her first CD. Her songs are perfect to listen when you are doing your homework. I am the girl who is easily to get impenitent and fussy. Here it is, Enyas songs can help me to get out of the bad temper, and to be placid.  <br /> <br />My favorite music in this album is Wild Child. This song reminded me of my childhood the simple laugh and childish cry, the day that I spend under sunshine; the little secret Ive had; and the story my grandma told me in a rainbow day.  I dont even remember the time when I start to feel busy and lazy. After I heard this song, I closed my eyes, stopped and listened. I havent had this feeling for a long time. It is a feeling of alive, and a feeling of beautiful around you. The warmness of sunshine, the dance of wind, the scent of roses, and all of those things which have being forgotten for a really long time.  <br /> <br /> <br />Anyway, I do love Enyas songs.  They are all magical, enigmatic, poetic and with a chorus type voice. For example: Fallen embers, Floras secret, sliver inches and Tempus Vernum (which means Viennas shadow in English). If you have time, please try it. ^_^ <br />
B0002DB52M|1.0|I had already typed up a review detailing the flaws in the movies central themes.  I set out to defy Lars von Trier's message and commentary on kindness, but I decided to leave the philosophizing out.  Suffice to say I found the themes and messages of this movie cynical and pretentious. <br /> <br />Speaking of pretention, however, many people have labeled this work anti-American.  I can't say I agree, but I do see how and why that accusation comes about.  As Roger Ebert put it, \\"His dislike of the United States (which he has never visited, since he is afraid of airplanes) is so palpable that it flies beyond criticism into the realm of derangement... Von Trier could justifiably make a fantasy about America, even an anti-American fantasy, and produce a good film, but here he approaches the ideological subtlety of a raving prophet on a street corner.\\"  I couldn't agree more.  While watching the movie, I didn't feel the 'sense' or 'spirit' of the United States.  I've felt this many times, being Chinese-American, while watching American movies that touched on Asian subjects--the 'feel' and 'spirit' of the subject matter was never tapped into because it's something unfamiliar to the film's makers.  To tell you the truth, the overall vibe I got from the movie was more European than anything else. <br /> <br />Lars von Trier has gone on record saying that he didn't feel his never visiting America would hamper his making a movie about America.  In my opinion, that's like saying I could make a film about Native Americans and portray them faithfully without ever spending any time on a reservation with a tribe.  I guess there's just a huge difference between wishing to portray something \\"successfully\\" versus wishing to portray them \\"faithfully.\\"   <br /> <br />Von Trier doesn't fail in this movie--he makes an original piece that is unique, though quite a bit too long for my taste.  The actors' give stellar performances given the framework they had to work within.   <br /> <br/>Some say the film is anti-American, but I say it's un-American.  Down to the ambiance and unconscious subtleties, von Trier doesn't possess the grasp of Americana it takes to make a film set in a believable America about believable Americans.  The lack of believable, realistic nuances that surround American life make this film a bit odd (okay, very odd).  What nuances and subtleties I felt while watching this film felt more, like I said, European in nature than American. <br /> <br />Lastly, this piece is rather pretentious.  It seemed to have been made to convey a message more than anything else.  There are little props, the characters play second fiddle to their dialogue, and realism is all thrown out the door.  Unfortunately, the concepts are conceited and the ideology and philosophies are dry.  I'm not saying that the stage set-up wasn't realistic--I understand it's not meant to be realistic--I'm saying the overall nuances are not realistic.   <br /> <br />I try to be open-minded, and indeed, I usually am the one in my family who enjoys films my relatives would consider too off-the-wall.  However, I couldn't help but feel all the 'ideologies' presented in this film came from a friend of my younger brother's: an adolescent boy who has too much time to waste (but thinks his life is oh-so-full-of-woe) whose philosophies are always on the conceited, cynical side and would do well to get out into the real world and get a reality check.  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if that boy spouted support of some of this movie's themes.  In short, I don't think the movie was worth the time I spent watching it.
B000002UZ6|4.0|Hard to go wrong with Tina Turner, but as many have pointed out there are many other songs that could have been included or substituted.  With so much material recorded by Tina, putting together a \\"best\\" is subjective and will disappoint some listeners.  But if you're looking for a good overall Tina sampler, this is a good start!
B00002E224|2.0|Haven't these people ever been on a good date? Because they ought to realize that this isn't one. <br /> <br />Basically the movie switches back and forth between stilted intellectual monologues and badly improvised spontaneity. The monologues are unbelievably vapid, and it never feels like the characters are listening to each other, just waiting for their turn to speak. <br /> <br />The improvised moments have the forced falseness that almost always comes from filmed improvisation. <br /> <br />There's no feeling here, no passion, no chemistry. The only emotional depth came when they said goodbye, but so little had passed between them up to that moment that I couldn't be moved. <br /> <br />I did hope the movie was building to some sort of exciting climax where they shave off Ethan Hawke's annoying goatee, but no such luck.

B0002DB52M|1.0|There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this \\"movie\\" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: Set up as a theater play more than a conventional movie, the film tries to capitalize on Nicole Kidman, who is without a doubt one of today's biggest and most talented stars!  The movie, however, is \\"different\\" just for the sake of being different; nothing more/nothing less!  One wonders how did this film win ANY awards apart from \\"worst movie of the year!\\"  Rent or buy at own risk.  You have been warned!
B0002DB52M|4.0|I can't decide whether it's a masterpiece or a rather pretentious soap box speech. Either way it's most definitely a raw, but intriguing look at human nature, capitalism, the United States, the world and all it's good and bad. It's both unnerving and touching, we wish to turn away, but are pulled back in at the same time because of an intellectual and polarizing look at humanity. This is a bold film that has to be congratulated on those merits. Theatrical and fresh, whether you like or hate it (both of which I can so vividly understand).<br /><br />The film's setting of a small depression-era Colorado town Dogville is showcased on a single large set. Houses and landmarks are simply chalk lines on the floor accessorized by a few pieces of furniture and props. The open, single set allows the camera to zoom in and swoop wherever it pleases, taking us right into the story. Nothing is hidden in Dogville, at least from us. It forces us to concentrate on the terrific cast who are forced to tell us the story almost entirely by themselves. They're up to the challenge.<br /><br />There is no getting around, though, that the dissection of humanity here is scathingly true and that we want to turn away from the discussions the film has that tend to line up with our own lives, feelings, judgments, and, well, humanity and nature. The lack of walls gives us the ultimate \\"if walls could talk\\" look into the worlds that we can see all while our characters can see one, ignorant to the horrors we can so plainly see. We can no longer hide behind our walls and claim ignorance to the horrors of the world we don't want to accept as real.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman is fantastic, she'll get uncountable award nominations that are well deserved. She is Grace, a mystery woman on the run from gangsters who ends up in Dogville and is taken in by Tom (Paul Bettany) who falls for her face and charm. He soon convinces the residents to let her win their favor, which she does. Her frailty too is evident to those other than Tom, and they unlike he are readily willing to exploit her by hanging the fact that she is a threat to them. The duality of power and those who have it plays out throughout the film and takes a striking twist at the end that provides a shocking, provocative and proper ending of the film and it's themes.<br /><br />The claim of anti-Americanism are only for those pre-disposed to dislike the movie, despite the fact that the film does take stabs and capitalism and probably America by default because of it's universal representation of it to the world.

B0001BKAEY|3.0|The Matrix was an AWESOME movie!  It had a great plot, amazing special effects, great characters, and sufficient acting ability.  The Matrix Reloaded was okay.  Many of the interesting characters who had died in the first movie were replaced by one-dimensional characters that most people didn't give a darn about.  The effects were better, but they were unable to make up for the lack of overall story and acting.  The Matrix Revolutions suffers from the exact same problem.  The characters are still annoying, there is even less plot (this whole movie takes place in the span of about a day), and it seems that Keanu Reeves' acting ability actually decreased. <br />Anyway, this movie picks up exactly where Reloaded ended; Neo (Reeves) is in a coma (sort of) along with Bane/Smith (Ian Bliss).  Smith, after taking over Bane's body, exited the matrix.  Now, his consciousness (or soul) is inhabiting the body of freedom fighter Bane.  Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) is still in shock after learning that the prophecy isn't true, or it isn't in the way he had believed it to be.  Finally, the army of sentinals is minutes away from breaching Zion, the last human city.  After Neo awakens, he and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) take a ship to the Machine City to end the war while Morpheus, Niobe (Jada Pincket Smith) et. al. return to Zion to help fight.  Neo makes a deal with the machines: Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has become a virus that the matrix can't even control anymore.  Smith is a self-replicating program that is causing a lot of problems for the machines.  If Neo destroys Smith, the war will end. <br />The only truly good thing about this movie is the final fight between Smith and Neo.  The APU's (which resemble Mech Warriors) are cool, but that scene is way too long.  The acting is terrible, save Ian Bliss who had to portray the Agent Smith character, and he did it very well.  This movie was also very confusing.  In the first Matrix, there were lines that were cryptic, but they made sense.  In this one and Reloaded, I think that the writers just threw stuff in because it either sounded cool or they had no idea either, so they hoped that viewers would just \\"go with it\\".  One thing they handled terribly was the Oracle's (Mary Alice) change in appearance.  Gloria Foster, the woman who played the oracle in the two previous movies, died before this movie was filmed, so she had to be replaced.  All they had to say was that there was a change in the matrix, but instead, they came up with a really confusing and hokey explanation. <br />Also, in the first movie, the allusions to the fact that Neo was a Christ-like character were subtle.  In Reloaded and especially this movie, they really lay it on thick.  After a while, it got a little old.  I mean, when Neo was jacked in by the machines, his body formed a cross, Smith was literally the Anti-Neo, he converted people's souls (in a sense), and, well I can't reveal the really big allusion. <br />In conclusion, I will say this: if you really, really like the Matrix movies, you should see this one only to see how everything ends.  If not, don't waste your time.  Also, don't let this review stop you from seeing the first Matrix.  It is a great movie, and, in my opinion, can stand pretty well on its own. <br />P.S. <br />Did anyone else notice that, during the final battle, after Smith and Neo collided mid-air and created that huge water sphere, Smith looked like Ganondorf in Legend of Zelda: Occarina of Time?  After Link and Zelda escape the castle, Ganondorf rises up and floats in the air (like Smith) and becomes Ganon.  Their facial expressions and positions of limbs are nearly identical.  Also, Link and Ganondorf were also opposites in the same way Neo and Smith are.  Just wondering.
B000005J56|5.0|Wow wow wow - I've not seen the movie, but I can't get enough of this music.  From the first time I heard this, it was like an old friend.  Something I've known all my life and could connect with, requiring no effort at all.  Each time I listen to this it seems to reach a little deeper and connect even more than the time before.  I'm so glad this got captured for the world to enjoy and savor, and wasn't lost like so much other music has been.  A real treasure!
038551123X|4.0|Jeff Lindsay's DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER, though flawed in terms of the mystery it contains, is mostly redeemable because it introduces a really great main character with a really distinctive voice. And Dexter Morgan, the great character who's both a savage serial killer and a nice-enough guy, keeps this novel compelling and readable even when the mystery that drives the plot takes a turn toward the completely preposterous.<br /><br />When the book focuses on Dexter's birth as a serial killer-as-avenger and his relationship with his late foster father Harry (who taught him how to redirect but not fight his urges to kill), it's at its best. We hear tales of Dexter trying to behave as though he were a human with emotions, how he rationalizes his behavior by only killing murderers. And we see Dexter at his most vicious, stalking his prey while the \\"Dark Passenger\\" within him directs him on how to kill. (The first chapter, in particular, is good.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, this stuff shows up only occasionally in the book. The majority of the book is devoted to the Miami police's hunt for another serial killer whose style is very much like Dexter's. Dexter, who by day is a blood-splatter analyst working with the police, is brought in on the hunt by his sister Deborah, an attractive, blonde cop who wants to solve the case so that she can get promoted off \\"hooker duty.\\" Standing in Deb's way is the politically-savvy, additionally hot yet boneheaded Det. LaGuerta, who is so attracted to Dexter that she can't see he's an emotionless shell who kills people.<br /><br />When the story includes them, it weakens, even though LaGuerta makes for a very interesting, developed character.<br /><br />And Dexter's a great character, as I said. He's torn in his loyalties to his family, his sense of \\"right\\" and his nature as a killer at all times. The latest case, because this killer's style is so like Dexter's own that he can sense the other criminal, leads Dexter to both doubt his sanity and make a lot of messy mistakes when creating his own crime scenes.<br /><br />But, as a satisfying mystery, the book overuses dream sequences and intuition, doesn't provide enough tangible clues and it never gives a voice or name to ANY of the victims, perhaps because it wants to remain tidy and quick in spite of lingering questions. And the book, sadly, has a sorta boneheaded ending.<br /><br />But, from the looks of things, this is just the beginning of Lindsay's books about Dexter. And that's good to know.es when creating his own crime scenes.    But, as a satisfying mystery, the book overuses dream sequences and intuition, doesn't provide enough tangible clues and it never gives a voice or name to ANY of the victims, perhaps because it wants to remain tidy and quick in spite of lingering questions.

0140186409|1.0|Grapes of Wrath is, by far, the worst book I've ever read.<br /><br />I'm not kidding. I'm not saying this lightly. This book is all about some dumb farmers. And, unlike most Steinbeck, it doesn't end with all the characters dieing-- you just wish it did. This man spends an entire chapter on describing the movements of a turtle. Not a joke. A far more intereasting story then this one would probably be the man the main character supposingly killed, but even that would suck. Steinbeck would write it something like this:<br /><br />\\"And after seeing the corpse falled, he cried. He cried like he had never cried before, tears streaming down his face endlessly. Rivers of water flowed out from his eyes, drowning bacteria and skin pores alike. The tears tasted salty; like ramen. But he couldn't help it.<br /><br />His father had worked the land. His grandfather had worked the land. He had been born here, he had lived here, he would have wanted to die here. The land was like his lifeblood, flowing through him. Goddam bank people taking the land. The land! His forefathers had lived on this land! His great-great-great-great grandaddy Bob had built the house with his bare hands, a swiss army knife and five bannanas. And he'd be damned if he had to leave the land!\\"

B00009RDG9|3.0|I'm not sure exactly what this movie was supposed to say?  Benicio del Toro (in an utterly bland performance) plays a trained killer who decides to kill two forest rangers and two hunters, telling himself that they were out to get him?  Even with an effectively disturbing opening in Kosovo, the movie ends up being a chase scene wherein Tommy Lee Jones (as always, effective) uses his tracking skills to track down Del Toro, lose him, track him again, lose him, etc.<br /><br />Director William Friedkin (French Connection) paces it well and it has some good action scenes, but ultimately it gets repetitive and rather dull as we all know how it will end up.<br /><br />Connie Nielsen (Basic) suffers through her rather needless role, and Leslie Stefanson as Del Toro's love interest provides some human spark to an otherwise heartless film.<br /><br />Good action, but not involving enough to be great.

0156027321|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book. While its appeal is not universal, henceforth its appeal, in part, to me, it is certainly a book to enjoy from the first page to the last. It will captivate your imagination with the journey young Pi makes.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|This movie is 100% action. Nothing here is going to illuminate the human condition or discuss any sort of heavy philosophy that much of good science fiction is renowned for. Ignoring that, and rating this movie purely in the escapism genre, we thing it rates fairly highly. It will be interesting to see if an audience develops for this film. The thing was absolutely crushed by negative reviews (a pity because Beckinsale is really so good in this film) and it did not do well at the box office. If it had just a little more going for it then we might feel more confident about it achieving a kind of cult status. As it is, we think the merits of the film might go unrecognized. It will do little to change the genre.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD WATCH: <br /> <br />For those of you looking for more excitement and less deep thought, Underworld is a fine, fine choice. Don't watch the Blade films. Ignore the myriad marshal-arts inspired works. This is a movie of real worth that delivers given the limitations of the super-action genre. It feels much more like The Crow than anything else and people who enjoyed that film we feel will like this a great deal as well.  <br /> <br />WHO SHOULD AVOID: <br /> <br />Provocative philosophy is wholly absent here. Movies that deal in this style and that subject matter are firmly in the domain of The Matrix and The Ghost in the Shell among others. This is the sort of movie that improves with a couple of beers to urge along the suspension of disbelief and allow for that immersive joy that some action movies are able to deliver. Another segment of audience that should avoid this film is that particular group that enjoys the romantic vampire. There is no romantic vampire here. None. Gone are the seductions, the languid coolness, and the deviousness of popularized vampires of the Bram Stoker come Anne Rice world. These vampires shoot guns. They're not very devious. There is a certain formality and decadence to the culture that reminds one of decaying Rome, which is a strong selling point to the overall plot and should've been explored more, but that is the only similarity to those pulp-fiction vampires.  <br /> <br />READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM
B000001FS3|5.0|In these days when many (include scores of people in the U.S.) find it fashionable to mock and kick all things American, it is a blessing to be able to re-open this musical celebration of the Land of the Free and its musical heritage. <br /> <br />With the stregth and pulsating wild energy of 'Where The Streets Have No Name', the album is a testament to U2's fascination with the American spirit - no apologies, no looking back, just riding the wave and sinking in the heat of Arizona desert. The album has a harm glow of red-hot lava, breathing the heat and the raw power. Bono does not feel guilty about connecting with the spirit of the Irish people who went to the United States and made the US of A, together with others, what it is today: a marvel of spirit of adventure, achievement and freedom. You get this sense even more acutely by watching Rattle and Hum DVD - a pictorial accompaniment to the tracks you already love.  <br /> <br />Few people regard it as such, but it is one the the most PATRIOTIC pro-American musical albums ever made - made by the foreigners, come to think of that. U2 is an Irish product, but few people would call it European, far far away from the whining, nanny-government arrogant world of self-important hereditary Parisian bureaucrats and overtaxed submissive Scandinavian workers, learning to enjoy the government which tells them what to think. The spirit of this album is so far away - in the land where Joshua Trees grow. And this is what makes the record beautiful.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|Okay-first off, I didn't even think it was POSSIBLE for an album to come out that was WAYYY better than Let Go, fortunately for everyone, Avril has somehow kicked it up a notch, releasing the most engaging album since Nirvana's Nevermind.<BR>I think everyone who even kind of cares about music should write a letter of thanks and gratitude to Avril for SAVING punkrock from being totally lame and unoriginal.  Do you think it would even still be around without Sk8er Boi?!?!  And don't forget everything she's done for fashion-like by inventing the tie-over-tanktop look!<BR>But back to the music.  I think Avril speaks for every girl out there who just wants to scream &quot;did you think that I was gonna give it up to you!?!&quot;<BR>I think under my skin is a WAYYY more mature album from someone who is already WAYYY older than her years.  <BR>Just face it-if it weren't for Avril, we would have all basically forgotten how to rebel-heck, we would have forgotten who we are.<BR>Avril is God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>I am also going to name my first born Avril, out of respect for the legend!!!
B000001EL3|4.0|A very good rock album by the Gods Of Greed. DESTROYER has aged remarkably well, better than the other albums of that period (the first line-up). There are orchestrations, some bold steps, and a general
B00004Z459|5.0|i was just reading a few reviews for this cd, and it amazed me how much people complain this is not 'real' metal like metallica or black sabbath or something like that. Of course it isnt, but who wants all bands to sound the same!!!!! And just because it doesnt sound like one of those old bands, doesnt make it not music. Now i dont like rap at all, but i love linkin park. i think they have good songs, i think the dj adds something special to the songs, and i love the way chester songs and screams. Also, the rapping isnt your normal cheesy gangsta rap, but kinda more relaxing to listen to with vocals tht mite just about mean something. take one of my favourites 'points of authourity'. this starts with rapping but because of the guitar and sound of it to me it sounds more metal than hip hop. Also, i would like to point out something to poeple who say chester just screams. Did you even listen to the cd? 'runaway' has some truly excellent singing in it, as does 'points of authourity' yeah, theres screaming, but when its done its done well. I adore the screaming bit at the end of one step closer. It seems to have so much agression behind it, which i like in music! also, if you ever see the live dvd, how many vocalists do you know who are note perfect all the way through their set, and can go from an insane screaming fit to singing clean and absolutely perfectly! i sure cant but wish i could!!!!!  <br />Id also like to point out tht i like many other 'real' metal bands such as slayer, metallica, iron maiden etc. but i also like other bands like linkin park, slipknot, papa roach, system of a down and even cradle of filth, hoobastank and HIM. wht im trying to point out is not all the bands you listen to have to be older metal bands to make you a true metal head, man new bands have alot of talent, just cos they use a dj doesnt mean they arent heavy!!! And screamed vocals can be good if done well!!! but also, straight acoustic songs are good, with clean singing. Just appreciate the bands for wht they are, not wht other bands are!! <br /> <br />Oh yeah, buy this cd, along with meteora and live in texas, all great!!!! (ps HIM and slipknot RUle!!!) <br /> <br />Peace <br /> <br />The REV

B00009UW0N|5.0|This film is a classic, nuff said. I have the original Anchor Bay 5.1 Dolby version from years back, awesome edition. This Divimax version is even better! Print is beauuutifullll and 5.1 mix is great. Don't listen to other reviews stating 'too much blue', 'not enough blue', etc, etc, etc. This is the theatrical version without the added scenes for the TV release(thank God!). If you're a fan and on the fence about spending your $ on this, don't be. Buy it now! Extras are great also, though they aren't as important to me as the film. I own a few Divimax editions and all of them are terrific. I only wish there was a DTS track. If you love 'Halloween' and have a higher-end setup, this is the disc to have. Viewing nirvana. Now if they would only release a Divimax of \\"The Fog\\".
B00005JMAH|3.0|Although I liked the movie it was lacking a lot of important parts. For people who havn't read the books, it was probably real comfusing. The movie didn't really explain how lupin knew harry's father or a lot of the other teachers and a lot of the parts in the story were moved around. I have read the books and thought the movie was kind of disappointing because they left out the really good parts that would have made it more understandable. Although Cuaron had a very good imagination for the movie and made it so realistic, it was kind of hard to understand it. I would still buy this movie though.
0393035158|2.0|I really only have three things to say:  THE END OF FAITH...ummmmm that idea sure seemed to work for Marx didn't it.  There never could be an end of faith...if religion was to vanish...it would be replaced with civil religion.  The people who give this book rave reviews....are...well....let's say a little low on the intelligence scale
B000001FDQ|5.0|Though many reviews of this album are scathing, these people are the people who need to listen to some of the other Yngwie albums.  If anyone would listen to his concerto suite you would see that Yngwie can put in as much feeling as he damn well wants to.  I'll admit he has an ego, and a lot of his music is the same, but he's not an emotionless robot (though sometimes his playing seems inhumanely fast).  Listen (or watch) the new G3 album/dvd and you can see the feeling he's putting into his music.  Alongside Satch and Vai, he isn't out of his league at all.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|I just saw this movie last night.  As you can tell by the date of this review, I was a very late bloomer to see this third installment of the Matrix...mostly because of all the negative comments it received.  So I cleansed my mind, popped in the DVD and here are the results: <br /> <br />This was really not as bad as everyone said.  Sure, it wasn't as crisp, refreshing and clean as the original Matrix, but no where near as clumsy and boring as Matrix Reloaded.  Although Revolutions has a \\"Superman-style\\" fight at the end where Neo and Mr Anderson are flying through the air, crashing into each other, breaking windows, causing sonic booms AND will never seem to end, it at least DID end (thankfully).  Moss gave another worthy performance, as good as she could with the script provided.  I really missed the original actress that played the Oracle.  This new actress was believable, but lacked skill in playing the part.  The fight sequences were greatly reduced from Part 2 and they wove a little more story into the plot. <br /> <br />All in all, not that bad, but if I want to watch a Matrix in the future, I'll stick to the original.
B000002J6H|5.0|A few thoughts about Stephen Stills and this CD: <br />(1) Stills plays all the instruments except when he's joined on a track by Booker T and the MGs, Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and, of course, Richie aka Richard Starkey. <br />(2) He was and is the driving force behind CSN and CSNY <br />(3) This CD went gold in November of 1970 (RIAA certified) <br />(4) It contains one of the greatest gatherings of rock-n-roll talent on one record. <br />(5) Stills is the only rock artist inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ON THE SAME DAY for his work with Buffalo Springfield and CSN. <br /> <br />Long may you run.
B00005U122|1.0|I'm a all time Pink Floyd fan. I own a dozen of their albums and I was at the unforgettable 1978 concert in Paris.  <br />I was so excited to buy this DVD after all the great ratings I read about it. <br />Sure it's a nice selection of titles, the image is good and the sound quality is technically superb! But that's all. :(  <br />Where has the Pink Floyd sound gone ? Where is the magic? Where is the emotion? The arrangement is terrible. Take \\"Shine On Your Crazy Diamond\\" for example. The voice misses completely the desperation it has on the Wish You Were Here album, the 3 background choir girls are good looking for sure and probably talented, but gosh, they have nothing to do here, it's a sabotage.  <br />How dare you play PINK FLOYD like SOUL music ? Appaling. I could not stand it and switched to the \\"real\\" albums. <br /> <br />If your are a real Pink Floyd fan, you'd better listen to it before spending your money in this mascarade. The Pink Floyd touch is definitely not here.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|The Diary of Alicia Keys is one of the best soul/ R&B albums I have ever heard. Her style in this ablum is a combination of Classical with some funk old school. I highly recommend anybody who loves soul music to buy this album because you'll be satisfied.

B000059H98|4.0|Only those who like campy B-flicks will truly appreciate and enjoy this movie. If you can sit back, relax and simply watch a movie without over analyzing it and criticizing everything then this movie is for you. Its corny, and stupid, but if you can handle it, you will /love it/ as I did. My husband personally thinks its the most stupid movie out there, but I really liked it for its fun factor. I honestly cant see how anyone enjoyed Dumb and Dumber, but many liked it. If you like fun B-flick type movies, this one is tops!
0345457684|4.0|A fantastic, well-envisioned future of humanity.  Crime is ubiquitous and high-tech, with our hero being a man of highly malevolent skills.  If you can get past the first three or four words, you'll be hooked.  Overall:  an excellent, addictive foray into speculative fiction.
B00005JMX6|4.0|OK..OK.... let's face the facts<br /><br />This movie is a thinly veiled \\"remake\\" of Risky Business for a new generation.<br /><br />The hooker in Risky Business is a Porn star here... the problem of the house being robbed and the car destroyed is replaced by $25,000 of school funds stolen here.... the dangerous pimp is replaced by a sleazy Porn movie producer.... the \\"plan\\" to get the money back is to film a porm movie as opposed to running a call-girl operation........ but obviously this movie is basically the Risky Business screenplay with a minor reworking.<br /><br />However, taken for what it is.... 90 minutes of harmless and mindless entertainment.... it is pretty good.<br /><br />It was much better than the other \\"serious\\" film we rented the same weekend..... GODSEND.  Ugghhh now that was flat, lame and bad.  A weak comparison to the OMEN series.<br /><br />That girl from the \\"24\\" Fox series is certainly growing up !
B00006AW2J|5.0|\\"To the person who wrote the Stones were poking fun at \\"let it be\\" (with their masterpiece \\"Let It Bleed\\") Only one problem - LET IT BLEED was out BEFORE \\"let it be\\" \\" <br /> <br />Not entirely true. The fact is that the Beatles' recorded \\"Let It Be\\" before \\"Abbey Road\\", but the released them the other way around. And as the Stones' released \\"Let It Bleed\\" in at the end of 1969, with them surely having heard the title of the Beatles' new project (sure, the project was called \\"Get Back\\" originally but the Stones had pretty close contact with the Beatles so they probably knew the album's real name, and if not they knew of the song itself) and maybe even having listened to the outtakes, it's quite possible it could have been a pun.
0393035158|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. It gave me a real sense of satisfaction from an intellectual point of view, but also left me feeling somewhat helpless  - waiting for the other (nuclear) shoe to drop, as it were.   <br /> <br />Having spent the last few years in a relationship, and ultimately in a failed marriage to a born again Jew, I was happy to have been deprogrammed by this book.  In the context of my marriage I did enjoy \\"believing\\", but now have come to terms with the distortions.  Having also experimented with psychedelics during this phase, I see little difference between such mind expanding drugs, and religion.  Both are done by choice, and both can produce euphoria and misery. <br /> <br />I did indeed have some spiritual experiences, but allowed myself to become sucked in to her world of fantasy and drugs. <br /> <br />Love is a many splintered thing... <br /> <br />On Sam Harris' web site (samharris (dot) org) he has a limited but useful Q&A section that addresses many of the criticisms leveled in these reviews.  Well worth reading! <br />
B00004CWO8|5.0|There were so many reviews of this version of Swan Lake that I had to really make a bold decision when purchasing this item. <br /> <br />The music is not good.  Be warned.  Something to do with the actual recording I suspect because on my system at least, the orchestra sounded like it was playing in a cardboard box at the back of the room.  No amount of adjustment seemed to help, apart from winding up the treble to gain brilliance and winding up the subwoofer to gain presence.  But the poor quality of the music was soon forgotten as the performance moved along, then brought back as the audience applauded from thier coffee can - somewhere near the orchestra. <br /> <br />I dont particularly like ballet - nor do I dislike it.  But I love a story with substance and I love new versions of old works which provoke thought.  And this version of Swan Lake certainly does that.  It could have been 10 minutes shorter, but then opinions such as that tend to be subjective. <br /> <br />The performance was iniitially a little heavy handed/footed.  The prince almost seemed to be having problems dancing in the boots provided for him.  He seemed flat footed and a little clumsy.  But this too seemed to come right as the performance warmed up.  And there was the obvious problem of seeing all those male swans when you have been used to the normal cast of female swans. I guess it was more of a change than I expected to see - the normal graceful performance translated into virile stregth.  But it worked for me. The makeup was well thought out and so were the costumes.  Both worked superbly. <br /> <br />The story is strong - the undertones of two societies unable to forgive that \\"something different\\" about thier leaders.  The tenderness, passion and strength are all there - in abundance. It is a tear-jerker for those of us who are tender hearted. The performance was sensual and provocative. <br /> <br />Will you like it?  Who knows?  I am not privy to your likes and dislikes - I am onlygiving an opinion.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I suspect it is something I will tend to watch alone rather than share with friends.  It will probably end up being one of those discs I will play infrequently on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  But having said that, my collection of nearly 1000 discs is made up entirely of discs which I play infrequently and many I have never played at all. <br /> <br />My suggestion - try it.  If you dont like it you can give it as a birthday present, albeit with some though as to who you give it to.
B00005U1YO|4.0|'Come With Us' has to be one of the most wildest albums I've ever hear The Chemical Brothers put out.  The album takes you through a adventure of acid-trance and mixed-up dance beats along with some great vocals by Beth Orton (The State We're In -a &#34;folky&#34; tune) and Richard Ashcroft (The Test - CLASSIC!).  It starts off with the introduction song 'Come With Us (One of the most wildest introductions to a CD I've heard since Music: Response).  They now give you 'It Began In Afrika' which was actually introduced to all the fans well over a year ago at one of their LIVE performances somewhere in the UK.  It Began In Afrika starts off with the voiced &#34;It began in Afrika-ka-ka-ka-ka&#34; and it is heard throughout the sounds of LIVE conga beats along with some dance beats.  At the end, they set you up for 'Galaxy Bounce' which stands out as one of their main tracks on the entire album.  'Star guitar' is a more layed back track as it takes you through a nice adventure (if you've seen the video then you'll know what I mean...get the Singles DVD).  They take a different turn in their beats and tunes with --&#62; My Elastic Eye, Denmark, and Pioneer Skies.  To end the album with a nice &#34;Elvis has left the building&#34; feeling, they give you 'The Test' which is a nice return to their old ROCK styles in their earlier career as 'The Dust Brothers'.<br /><br />Come With Us was never one of their most admired albums, but it definitely will make its stand.  That's my review, thanks!
B00000AFFI|5.0|i didn't realize how important this album was to me until i lost it (this happened recently). because i'm poor, i decided to buy uh huh her first because it is new and exciting. bad move. is this desire is her most consistently good record. suprisingly, as it is pretty dark, it got me through the toughest summer of my life. usually it pisses me off that she can't write a song in a major key. this is especially distracting on uh huh her. it makes all the songs sound the same, drony, uninteresting while desparately trying to be interesting. the textures on is this desire? are incredible, yet it is still raw enough (as opposed to stories from the city...) to evoke intense emotion and imagery. i also think the excercise of moving outside herself made this album stand out from her body of work. she channels these characters so well that upon first listen you might not realize that this isn't about her. if there's one thing i hate about female artists, it's self absorption (i'm guilty of writing like i'm the center of the universe). self absorption only works when it strikes a balance between raw/angsty and a certain level of perspective. on this record, polly is making other characters self absorbed, and i like it. the title track is particularly moving and haunting. the sparseness of the arrangement lets her guitar work shine on the chorus while her voice is left vulnerable and lilting as she asks \\"Is this desire enough, enough, to lift us higher. Is this desire?\\" Now apply that to mary and joseph. <br /> <br />i'd highly recommend this record. or buy it for someone you love...
B000002H2H|5.0|The second offering from Metallica is easily one of their best.  Similar in sound to its sister album (\\"Master of Puppets\\") \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is a more balanced album than \\"Kill 'Em All\\".  The songs range from being very heavy (\\"Fight Fire with Fire\\") to slower and more drawn out (\\"Fade to Black\\") and there's even an instrumental, \\"Call of Ktulu\\", which changes tempo several times.  The theme is constant however, all the songs deal with death.  Nuclear holocaust, war, suicide, drowning, electrocution, even the ten plagues of Egypt.  \\"Fade to Black\\" is the best song here if not the best Metallica song ever.  It starts out moderately slow and ends with one of the greatest guitar solos of all time.  \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is easily the next best track; contains an awesome riff that'll be hard to forget.  \\"Creeping Death\\" is about the plagues of Egypt. Contains arguably the best songwriting on the album and a staple at most Metallica concerts.  Since Metallica has done few you instrumentals you won't want to miss \\"Call of Ktulu\\"; its a fitting end to the record.  \\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" could have easily been on \\"Kill 'Em All\\" as it is the heaviest song here.  \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" is one of the heavier songs here and its loved by many Metallica fans, though I can't say its a personal favorite. The title track suffers a bit from a weak chorus but still rocks. And then there is \\"Escape\\", a great metal song that is perfectly placed right after \\"Trapped Under Ice\\".  Thats eight songs that add up to over 50 minutes of high quality metal music.
630575067X|1.0|This is definetely the most dissapointing movie of all time. The storyline is dull and not enjoyable to follow. The characters arnt great and help to add to the overall corney feeling of the movie. Theres a half hour pod racing sequence that just slows down the movie and you may fall asleep during. I realize that since this is a \\"star wars\\" I probably rate it more harshly then other movies but still, this movie was in the works for years and it would of been better left on the drawing board. I will never go to see episode 2 or 3 as this is a clear indication of the direction of these prequels. Stick to the original Star Wars movies, \\"Episode I\\" does absolutely nothing possitive for the series.
B0001US62I|5.0|This cult classic continues to creep out old viewers and a new generation with its dark tale of voodoo, revenge and the curse of fate. Is Mickey Rourke mad, reincarnated and cursed to hell, or a patsy set up to take the fall for murder? Is De Niro the devil himself? Leave the lights on when you watch this one. Ugly and lurid, but still seductively thrilling....like evil itself.
B000002JKA|5.0|Those are four words to describe Dream Theater's 1994 masterpiece \\"Awake\\". Not a single word can describe how much I love this album. It's so dark, heavy, powerful, and beautiful beyond words. Every song on here have a lot of imagery and will put pictures in your head. Even the awesome album cover will also put a picture in your head as well, it's so awesome. The lyrics on this album are very dark, optimistic, emotional, and very mysterious. They also deal with various topics such as love, hate, betrayal, addiction, and human emotions. James LaBrie's epic vocals are awesome and powerful beyond words. John Petrucci's guitarwork is simply amazing. Plenty of heavy riffs and breathtaking solos, and speaking of riffs, this album has some of John's heaviest riffs ever. John Myung has great bass lines that you can hear, Kevin Moore's keyboard effects are great (this would be the last DT album he would be on), and Mike Portnoy's drumming is just fantastic and perfectly well timed throughout. The album kicks off with \\"6:00\\", and it's no doubt one of the heaviest and best songs on here, and it's a great way to start this masterpiece. The next song \\"Caught in a Web\\" is another dark and heavy song, and it's my personal favorite song on here. Track three \\"Innocence Faded\\" another favorite song of mine is somewhat of a power ballad has some more of those optimistic yet powerful and mysterious lyrics, and the musicianship on this song is just outstanding. \\"Erotomania\\" which is part one of the \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" trilogy is a fantastic instumental with more great solid musicianship as always. \\"Voices\\" is very epic and beautiful, and \\"The Silent Man\\" is a nice accoustic balllad, and another favorite of mine. \\"The Mirror (track seven) and \\"Lie\\" (track eight) are awesome heavy songs with more fantastic guitar riffs, and more great vocals to boot. Track nine \\"Lifting Shadows off a Dream\\" with beautiful atmosphere added and more powerful musicianship. Track ten \\"Scarred\\" which is the longest song on this album clocking in at just below the 11 minute mark is very well complexed, and very dramatic throughout. Then we finally reach the closing piano/keyboard driven \\"Space-Dye Vest\\" This song just brings tears to my eyes, it's so sad, haunting, ominous, and most of all depressing. There's also some samples of various TV shows and movies on this song as well.

When his plane is hijacked by terrorists, he sends everyone else to safety, including the Secret Service, and goes after the bad guys himself to rescue his wife and daughter.

B00028HBKM|5.0|I find it almost humorous that individuals, and possibly some under ground orgainizations, would use a film review board to masquerade their convictions. Many conclusions can now be drawn from the bitterness of the attacks that have been leveled, and are still being leveled, at an entire religion, it's founder, and a single film artist. Well, I will not go into the details of every attack but I can atleast offer the following conclusions based soley on some of the negative comments made on this board.  <br /> <br />1) If you were bold enough to say this movie is not at all biblically accurate - one could deduce that you are the type of character that would read The Da Vinci Code and walk away believing that it was a historically accurate discourse. <br />  <br />2) If you stated that this film was \\"sadistic porn\\" or \\"overly violent\\" - you probably, by way of hypocrisy, thought Kill Bill was an entertaining work of art.  <br /> <br />3) If you cited the film as being anti-semitic - you obviously do not know that orthodox Christians believe that Christ died for the sins of humanity and not the sins of a single race (of which he was a part of!!)  <br /> <br />Well, it is quite apparent that even with all of the negative film reviews, ADL contempt, liberal anti-religious dissent and misguided mythic paganism - this film has proven to be extremely successful. One could almost attribute a quarter of the success to controversy alone but, most of the success can be respectfully given to Christians, like myself, that want to see the history of their religion unaltered by the guise of revisionist history and/or competing religions. Now, this is not to say that the film 100% accurate portrayal of how it was when Christ was tried, scourged and crucified but the quoted scripture in the film was accurate and much of the proceedings were accurate based on historical documents that describe how corporal and capital punishments were conducted at that time.
6305622914|5.0|When you're out of work and owe back child support, have an aging mom to care for, credit card bills you don't want your wife to know you can't pay, and just feel less a man because you can't support your family, what do you do?  You take it all off. Carlyle is disgusted when he finds his ex has gone to see some Chippendales, and even more disgusted when he finds out what the dancers make. He figures - hey, I can do THAT. What happens next, as he and his buddies begin their career as strippers, will leave you rolling on the floor. Take it off and give it up for the \\"FULL MONTY\\"!
B00005JNEI|5.0|By far the most important episode in this film is the section where Bush, after being informed of the fact that the second tower had been hit by a plane, fails to carry out his duties as commander in chief for a crucial seven minutes. A competent commander in chief would have responded by politely excusing himself from the class and heading for the car in which he came in, which had a secure phone, and, while ordering the driver to head for Air Force One, using the phone to call the appropriate people in Washington and taking command of the situation. <br /> <br />The film clearly shows that instead he sat there clueless for seven crucial minutes, while the students were reading The Pet Goat to him, not knowing what other terrorist attacks were in the process of happening, and while, in fact, two more hijacked planes were headed for Washington. This is not the way Bill Clinton would have responded, nor for that matter Bush senior. <br />If a uniformed general had failed to act like that, he would not only have been removed from command, but also court marshaled for dereliction of duty.  <br /> <br />Thank God that the Cold War was over and that we were not under a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union. <br /> <br />This is a crucially important movie that all Americans should see because Bush's failure to carry out his responsibilities of commander in chief during these crucial minutes proves that he is not fit to be commander in chief. It makes a compelling case that the people must remove him from his command this November. <br />
B00003CXDB|5.0|When Michael Douglas won his Oscar, he thanked the directors \\"Because most people thought this was a role I couldn't play.\\" And it is, far different from fun like \\"Romancing the Stone\\" but he does it very, very convincingly. \\"Greed is good\\" says Douglas' Gekko, and proves it to his innocent understudy, Charlie Sheen as a stockbroker. It's also great to see Charlie and Martin together as...father and son. Darryl Hannah is hot as ever as Gekko's ex-mistress and Sheen's new love. This movie posts quite a question....how much money is enough and how far are you willing to go to get it? An interesting look as well into the financial wheelings and dealings of corporate America.
B000002G85|5.0|this is the most soulful singing and the most blistering guitar--most of the reviews say it sounds too much like delaney and bonnie, etc. THIS IS THE BEST CLAPTON ALBUM EVER and i've followed him since cream, past phil collins and even to babyface. Listen to the vocals on \\"I Don't know Why\\".  Nothing else to say...  except, maybe, listen to the guitar on \\"Let it Rain.\\"
B000002O5L|5.0|I am such a big Petty fan that it was hard to give some of his prior albums less than five stars. But okay, I admit it, he had lost some of his brilliance. Full Moon Fever represents a thorough and effective restoration of Petty's rule over American rock music. <br /> <br />Perhaps this sounds like something of an oxymoron, but let me give this a try to sum up the album: In FMF, Tom Petty ties together a lot of the themes of his earlier albums and states implicitly a lot of the themes of ambivolence and confusion of modern life that he'd alluded to in the 70s and 80s. (My sister got lucky, married a yuppie, took him for all he was worth/Now she's a swinger, dating a singer/I can't decide which is worse.) But, as a subsequent line reads, \\"But not me, baby/I've got you to save me\\". Tom Petty, you save me every day and you conveniently also saved your career with this one.
0393035158|5.0|Wow! I have been waiting for someone intelligent, wise, and articulate enough to express the message of this book for all of my 81 years on this earth (as I have witnessed so many fellow human beings needlessly kill eachother in the name of God). If we are lucky, Sam Harris might change the course of history.  I believe it is the duty of all free-thinking, compassionate, and rational people to read this book.
076790592X|5.0|I wept, smiled, laughed and wept again.  Yes, this book did that to me.  It's been a while since all of my finer senses and emotions were so thoroughly evoked by a book.  From the first page to the last, I knew I had a treasure in my hands.  I knew that after reading the book, I have to write about what I feel about it and find no rest until I do so.   <br /> <br />Morrie was the best teacher anyone could ever have.  Gentle, loving, wise and pouring his life to the people that crosses his path.  His student for life, Mitch Albom, had the honor of completing his final thesis with his dying professor on the lesson of life.  This book is that final thesis and his story is still touching many lives who do not know him.  Me included :) <br /> <br />It is a true story, by the way.  If it were not, I would have been touched, too.  But it would have also left me wondering, \\"Does a person like Morrie actually exist in this world?\\"   <br /> <br />I'm so glad that he did indeed exist, for it gives me something to aspire.  To want to be like Morrie - to be unencumbered by the surface things of the world, and to live life to the fullest. <br /> <br />I especially liked the part where he talked about aging with Mitch.  That when he is older, he doesn't envy the younger ones because he had his chance to live as a youth, and he lived it well.  What I gathered from that was, you wish you were younger again and have a chance to live your life again only if you have wasted those years in the first place. <br /> <br />And the part which convicted me the most was this: paying attention to the ones who are sitting in front of you and wanting to spend time with you.  In my activity-driven life, I try to juggle many things at once.  Reading, planning, eating while talking to my family.  Morrie was different.  He dropped everything he was doing whenever Mitch or the others visit him and paid undivided attention to them.  In his dwindling hours of living, he gave precious time to them. <br /> <br />I am convicted that I should pay more attention to my family members and friends and be fully present with them instead of thinking of that letter to write, the book to read, that task to accomplish, etc.  Besides, I never know which day is going to be my last.  Why not spend the time that I have been given, saying and doing the things I want to say and do to the ones I love? <br /> <br />Get the book.  It will bring your perspective back to what's important in life. <br />
B000002H33|5.0|Trust no one, but the Master!! <br /> <br />Don't pay attention to the \\"person\\" who gave one star, I checked the other CDs he has reviewed and, according to him, the only real metal bands are the nu metal ones, he gave five stars to Kelly Osbourne, 5 stars to Avril Lavigne, 5 stars to Gene Simmons. And according to him, Slayer is a rip-off of Linkin Park.... enough already... you get the idea by now. <br /> <br />The \\"Master Of Puppets\\" & \\"...And Justice For All\\" are the best things Metallica have put out to date. The so called Black Album is great, but it just is a good album, the \\"Master Of Puppets\\" (and Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\") are the major achievements of 80s metal. <br /> <br />I have tried very hard to find why people see in Cliff Burton such a master. He performs in this albums and, Jesus, he was good, but not the exceptional absolute master many diehard fans claim he was. <br /> <br />Anyway, some songs of this albums (namely: \\"Orion\\", the title track, \\"Disposable Heroes\\" and \\"Damage Inc\\") are timeless masterpieces of metal. If you miss them, is your fault, but don't trust me, as matter of fact, trust no one, listen by yourself!
B00005OM4N|5.0|First, it was 1999's ...BABY ONE MORE TIME. Then, it was 2000's OOPS!... I DID IT AGAIN. Now, Britney has come back with her third album, BRITNEY. The album coincides with the film CROSSROADS, Britney's first major starring role. This album is sort of more on how she is growing up. The album shot straight to the No. 1 spot when it was released. <br />I'M A SLAVE 4 U <br />The album's first single. The song talks about how Britney wants to be let go of because she's not a little girl. She's a young woman who \\"really wants to dance tonight with you\\". She says that the music makes her \\"a slave for you\\", so all she wants to do is dance. <br /> <br />OVERPROTECTED <br />The album's third single. This one is of the theme songs from CROSSROADS. In this one, Britney talks about that she has always been overprotected and she wants everybody to stop because she's no longer a little girl. She's saying that everybody is trying to protect her from making mistakes, but we all know that we make mistakes and when we do, we all learn from them. Britney has to do that, even if she does not want to make any mistakes, she knows that it's gonna happen, but she's not worried because she knows she'll learn from them. <br /> <br />LONELY <br />Not bad. Just your average break-up song. <br /> <br />I'M NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN <br />The second single from the album. We all know what Britney means here, so stop with all the \\"What are you? A boy or a man?\\" jokes. Britney is saying that she is no longer a girl. What makes her no longer a girl is that she has grown-up, both physically, mentally, and her age says so. She has learned a lot when she was a girl, but she still has a lot to learn before she becomes a woman. That's what the song is about. This was the second theme song from CROSSROADS. <br /> <br />BOYS <br />The fourth single from the album. Remember back when Britney did (YOU DRIVE ME) CRAZY? Instead of releasing the album version as the single, she remixed it into (YOU DRIVE ME)CRAZY (THE STOP! REMIX) and made it the theme to 1999's DRIVE ME CRAZY. She did the same for this song. Instead of releasing this version of BOYS, she remixed it into BOYS (THE CO-ed REMIX) and she had Pharrell Williams of N.E.R.D. provide his vocals, turning it into a duet. The Co-ed remix was released as a single and made the theme song to AUSTIN POWERS in GOLDMEMBER. Both Britney and Pharrell make their appearances in the video. One more person makes an appearance in the video. Guess who, baby, yeah! <br /> <br />ANTICIPATING <br />Not a bad song. <br /> <br />I LOVE ROCK 'N ROLL <br />The fifth and final single from the album. Before Britney could talk, this classic song was originally recorded by the infamous Joan Jett. Evem though Joan Jetts version is much better, because of it's real edged heavy rock sound combined with Joan's rock voice and rock style, Britney re-did this song with the intention of a classic and succeeded. <br /> <br />CINDERELLA <br />From this album, this song is definitely my favorite. She talks about how her boyfriend always referred to her as \\"Cinderella\\" and she's fed up with his crap. She tells him that she's leaving him for good, in other words \\"Cinderella's got to go\\". My favorite part of the song is the spoken verse which goes like this: I USED TO SAY I WANT YOU. YOU CAST ME IN YOUR SPELL. I DID EVERYTHING YOU WANTED ME TO, BUT NOW I SHALL BREAK FREE FROM ALL YOUR LIES. I WON'T BE BLIND, YOU SEE. MY LOVE, IT CAN'T BE SACRIFICED. I WON'T RETURN TO THEE. <br /> <br />LET ME BE <br />Not bad. <br /> <br />BOMBASTIC LOVE <br />Great song! <br /> <br />THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME <br />Okay! <br /> <br />WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME <br />Everyone thought that this song was a duet between Britney and ex-beau Justin Timberlake. Again, they are wrong. Justin Timberlake and Wade J. Robsin wrote the song and Justin provided the back-ups. That's all. Not a bad song. <br /> <br />A great album by a great artist.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the year of 2003 Britney returned to the music scene from her wild year of antics with the infamous MTV kiss with Madonna. In November 2003 Britney released her stunning Cd 'In The Zone'. Britney released her best album yet. She transformed herself from a sexy young teenager to a provocative young woman. In the Zone takes listeners though a journey of different styles of music. From Hard hitting dance tracks, to dirty ghetto Hip Hop to viby trance tracks to beautiful peaceful ballads. This album shows Britney at her best. This album made critics label her \\"The New Madonna\\".  <br />Me Against The Music - This is the lead single from the album. It is the infamous duet featuring Madonna. It is a hard hitting club dance track, very different from what is on the radios these days. The track is just about being in a club and being oblivious to everyone and freestyling. This is my 2nd Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. 10/10  <br /> <br />(I Got That) Boom Boom - This track is an Up-tempo Hip Hop track perfect for the clubs. The track has also has an Indian vibe to it. This track features the Ying Yang Twins, which gives the track a dirty ghetto, feel to it. This song is my 3rd Favourite song on the album, and is one of the best Hip Hop songs I have ever heard. 10/10  <br /> <br />Showdown - The famous UK producers Bloodshy & Avant produced this track. It is a great sexy dance track which features Britney whispering \\"I don't wanna be a tease. Would you undo my zipper please\\" This track is done very well. Again very unique. 9.5/10  <br /> <br />Breathe On Me - This song is very club-savvy orientated and is one of the most sensual tracks on the album. The song has a HOT beat and is reminiscent to Kylie's Can't Get You Out Of My Head. This track describes the intensity of a relationship so hot that they don't even need to touch, just breathe. This is my Favourite track on the album and one of my favourite songs of all time. I can automatically see this song go #1 if it is released. 10/10  <br /> <br />Early Mornin - The second this track commences you will automatically know that it is Moby produced. This track is very sexy and has a trance feel to it. The song is very vibey and is about the next morning after a big night out. 7/10  <br /> <br />Toxic - This is the second single from the album which is produced by Bloodshy & Avant. The song is HOT and fits Britney perfectly. The track is a hard hitting dance track which could easily be used as the theme song to Alias or the next bond movie. Critics are describing it the best song Britney has released since I'm A Slave For You. I love this track so much because of its uniqueness. 10/10  <br /> <br />Outrageous - This is a typical R&B penned track. The second the song commences you will automatically realise it is R Kelly produced. This song is again perfect for the clubs and has an Indian vibe to it. The chorus is very catchy. 9.5/10  <br /> <br />Touch Of My Hard -This is the most sensual song on the album. This song is a beautiful dance ballad reminiscent to Madonna's The Power Of Goodbye. This song is an ode to self-love. Although this song is not dirty at all, it is Britney's most mature song to date and has a sexy vibe to it. This is definitely a stand out track on the album. 10/10.  <br /> <br />The Hook-Up - Redzone, the famous team behind the Britney/Madonna duet, produced this track. This song has an R&B reggae feel to it and is fairly uptempo. This track takes some getting used to but when your hooked your definelty hooked. 9/10  <br /> <br />Shadow - This track is a beautiful ballad produced by The Matrix. This is very reminiscent to Avril's I'm With You. This track shows Britney's vocals at its best. 9/10  <br /> <br />Brave New Girl - reminds me of her earlier stuff, Lucky in particular 10/10  <br /> <br />Every Time - This track is absolutely stunning. Britney shines in this tale of heartbreak. This is definitely one of the most beautiful ballads ever written by not only Britney herself but of all time. The simple harmony makes you feel the words and the pain Britney has felt. This is a Guy Sigsworth produced ballad. 10/10  <br /> <br />Me Against The Music (Remix) - This is remix to the First Single. The song was remixed by Peter Rishi and an Indian vibe has been added to it. The song is still very clubby and is probably one of the best remixes I have ever heard. 10/10  <br /> <br />ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS CD AND I DON'T THINK IT COULD HAVE GOTTEN ANY BETTER. THIS ALBUM IS VERY UNQIUE AND IS BRITNEY'S BEST ALBUM SO FAR. OVERALL I GIVE IT A 10/10  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005MNP7|5.0|Eat To The Beat often gets compared to the Blondie masterpiece Parellel Lines, and to be fair, the latter is a near perfect album that is hard to, well, beat. What Beat loses in sheer enjoyment, it more than makes up for in musical evolution and variety. Die Young, Stay Pretty and Atomic are wonderful precursors to The Tide Is High and Rapture, respectively, and Slow Motion is a joyful Motown tune on par with Denis and In The Flesh. And if you're looking for classic punk/pop Blondie, look no further than the excellent title track,Dreaming, Union City Blues,The Hardest Part(who else would write a song about an armored car heist than Debbie Harry?),Living In The Real World, and the positively creepy Victor. Only the lullaby Sound-A-Sleep which tries to be a latter day Fade Away and Radiate falls a bit short, and that's only because it meanders on for 5 minutes or so. If you're looking to start a Blondie collection, start with Lines, but Eat or their debut album should follow right after.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I liked Daredevil.  But there were story points that were lagging IMHO.  I read the graphic novel of the film and the Director's Cut, if it follows the novelization (and I assume it does) is a far superior story.  The largest omission was that of the character of Dante Jackson (Coolio in the movie).  He is a murder suspect who's case nobody will touch but Matt Murdock.  Ironically, it's this \\"small fish\\" that leads to the fall of the Kingpin!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Before i even saw this movie, i owned it. I am a big Pacino fan, but you can't fathom how good this movie is if you haven't seen it, no matter what you have heard.  <br />    Even if you don't like gangster or rags-to-riches type movies, Scarface would still be an excellent movie thanks in part to Pacino's acting which is amazing. He convinces you that he is Tony Montana, the cuban with a scar on his face. Al Pacino's best movie. <br />
B000002A3T|5.0|Since its initial release in April of 1994, Pink Floyd's \\"The Division Bell\\" has become somewhat of a closet classic in a sense. While the album has been consistantly bashed by critics for not being \\"Son of Dark Side of The Moon\\" or \\"The Wall Part 2\\", \\"The Division Bell\\" has found its place among the very finest of Pink Floyd's work. Roger Waters was long out of the picture by the time this album was released and David Gilmour was fully in charge of steering the band (as he was on 1987's \\"Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\", Floyd's first post-Waters project).<br /><br />Musically, the album continues the band's tradition of combining strong rock musicality with atmospheric instrumentals, Musique Concrete sound effects and an overall conceptual theme. The concept for \\"The Division Bell\\" has to do with communication or a lack of it. Tracks such as \\"What Do You Want From Me\\", \\"A Great Day For Freedom\\", and \\"Coming Back To Life\\" are filled with passionate yet wrenching vocals alongside what is arguably David Gilmour's best guitar work to date. \\"Poles Apart\\" is an adventerous track with many twists and turns beginning as a solid acoustic tune with a slight Country feel to it. The track then shifts to a collage of fairground noises and an odd keyboard melody before switching back to a beefier rock-oriented variation of its main opening theme. \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" is classic Floyd with its pondering moody theme and affectionate dark vocals from keyboardist Richard Wright who also offers some synth leads reminiscent of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\". \\"Take It Back\\" is a simple pop-rock piece that sounds like it could've been lifted from a U2 album while the album's closing track \\"High Hopes\\" is an emotion-filled piece with many references to Pink Floyd's past embedded in the lyrics. The two instrumentals \\"Cluster One\\" and \\"Marooned\\" are both atmospheric in style. The former being more piano-based while the latter features more guitar dominance.<br /><br />These are just some of the musical highlights of \\"The Division Bell\\". Indeed, after several listens, the album can certainly grow on you. While the album is not on par with the band's best known work, \\"The Division Bell\\" is still one of Pink Floyd's finest albums. Time has gone on to show that this was also the band's final studio album. Considering the time and effort and flawless musicianship displayed on this album, \\"The Division Bell\\" proves that Pink Floyd left us not with a sniffle or a whimper, but a triumphant Bang.<br /><br />Thanks for the memories!!!highlights of \\"The Division Bell\\".

B00005JN2X|5.0|After seeing Micheal Mann's Heat i first saw the preview for this movie and thought, with Tom Cruise in it the movie it could be even better than Heat. I would have to say that Collateral was better than Heat, mostly because of the 1-hour difference in movie time.  <br /> <br />I'm not going to go into what happened in the movie because i am sure someone else's review will. If you've never seen a Micheal Mann film, he is very good at using a combination of script and filming to get the viewer to associate themselves with the characters as well as develop them to a point where you don't want to see them die, and when they do it's unexpected and really twists your insides if you allow yourself to be serious about watching the movie. <br /> <br />Everyone is talking about Tom Cruise playing a bad guy, which he did an excellent job doing. His character, Vincent, is a kind of guy that doesn't take crap from anyone and feels no emotion or pity on people he kills, he plays the perfect psychopathic killer with a twist, a comical twist. Just the cab scenes are better then any reality tv show, and all the while the conversations seem realistic. <br /> <br />Jamie Foxx steals the show though. He plays a kind of quiet, shy cab driver who is mentally T-boned by Cruise's character. Foxx seemed to have his life planned out, but it wasn't going anywhere, and Vincent opened his eyes that he wasn't going anywhere fast and his dream of a limo line was not going to happen. Vincent changes Foxx's characters life in both a positive way for his future and a negative way in the present. If you didnt understand that last line, then watch the movie and you'd understand. <br /> <br />This movie was good up till the very end, not the events leading up to the last scene. The best part about the ending is that it is ironic since the irony came out of Cruise's mouth. It was kind of similar to Heat's ending where Pacino is chasing De Niro and they are talking all the way to the end. The end in Collateral is similar, but more intense. <br /> <br />This is easily the best movie of the summer, and Number 1 on my list of movies to own. If you've seen this movie I highly recommend Heat, and vis versa.
B0002DB52M|1.0|What a boring movie!!! Very slow paced.  if you turn the subtitles on you can watch the entire thing in 2X without missing a thing.  This was low budget boring film.  I would not waste my time.
B0000AM6JI|5.0|Both Pacino and De Palma make another masterpiece. Reuniting after Scarface pays off for the actor-director combination.  <br /> <br />Its about an ex-drug dealer, or at least thats how Carlito sees himself. After getting out of jail the drug dealer decides that he wants to change his life and become clean. However he can't leave behind his old druggie friends and stays in the buisness looped in a catch-22. He can't get away from drugs and killing, no matter how hard he tries. It seems that everyone else around him are what he is trying to escape from, but either he can't see or doesn't want to leave it, and soon the cops believe his is involved in drug deals and murder. As he flees from people trying to kill him, he tries to escape the city with his woman, only to come to a gut-retching end that really comes out of nowhere. <br /> <br />The ending left me pissed off, if you've seen this movie than you know why. I would definately suggest this movie to anyone who enjoys a good movie. Pacino does it again by convincing you that he is Carlito, and solidifies his position as one of the best actors of all time.
B000002GGU|5.0|Cuts like a Knife had a couple of songs that showed Adams's songwriting was improving, but I'm kind of shocked how great of an album Reckless is because Cuts Like a Knife was just so-so. The album opens with One Night Love Affair, and ends with Ain't Gonna Cry, and everything in between those two cuts is excellent. You'll probably find yourself singing along with most of the songs on the album. Reckless is just one of those feel good albums that you really get into while it's playing and it will leave a lasting impression. Reckless is one of those most have albums.
B0000024K1|5.0|This IS the quentesential rap album.  No other Rap album even comes close (O.K. the Chronic is up there).  Talk about production..these are all samples/breakbeats/noises and it all sounds like a band playing it in the studio.  The bomb squad outdid themselves.  There is no comparison to this.  Chuck is the regular joe thats tired of all the bull***t that's going on.  His counterpart is Flava Flav the one that doen't let s**t get too serious.  Terminator X keeps the beats going and \\"On the edge of Panic\\" Proffesor Griff is the social conscious in the background.  Few albums can capture the esscence of a genre, this one does.  I have music from Tony Bennet to AC/DC and Miles Davis to Comptons Most Wanted.  This IS the Ultimate Rap Album period point blank.
B0000025C0|4.0|Boston's second album Don't Look Back isn't as good as the first album, but is still good. The title track is a classic as well as Feelin' Satisfied, and A Man I'll Never Be. I'll just say if you liked the first album you'll enjoy this one their both pretty simuliar in sound.
1565123875|5.0|Finally a contemporary Nigeria writer has emerge as I could relate to every single character in this great literary piece I can even name each character match within the soci-political arena of modern day Nigeria. <br /> <br />It very typical of the pretense of the post colonial Nigerian in the character of Eugene and yet so innocent in Kambili's character which made it all the more touching <br /> <br /> <br />a trully wonderful book
B000002572|5.0|Boston's first album simply titled Boston has to be one of the greatest debut albums of all-time. All most every song on the album is a classic rock radio staple and people of all ages love this album, it has a timeless appeal to it. With great guitar work outs like More than a Feeling and Foreplay/Long Time it's hard to resist such a great album like this one. Every single song on here is a classic. This is perhaps one of the greatest albums of all-time.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Where to start? It's difficult to write a review for a band I have such admiration and respect for. I've been a huge rock/metal fan for many years now, i've listened to the majority of bands that are out there on the shelves to buy, and have come to expect a familiar sort of sound from each new album i try out. What I mean is, any new album I seem to try, I can instantly compare it to another previous album thats come before it. In my opinion there isn't enough experimental/alternative music being made, alot of heavier bands seem to try and be different, but never quite suceed in doing so. An example is korn, while they have their own unique sound that you can instantly reconize, they still arn't a million miles away from other such metal bands.  <br /> <br />Now we come to Mars Volta, while they can be compared to At the Drive-in, they still manage to be completly unique in their approach and their overall style of music. When I first tried this album notthing could prepare me for just how incredible they really are. I've had expectations of many albums before, and usually them expectations arn't met, not because they are too high, but because bands seem to stay on the same path and don't try to be too different in their approach to a new album. That can be ok if you're a big fan of the band, but i'd prefer more bands to venture out into the unknown and be adventurous in their work, to experiment more with sounds and styles, riff's and the drumming. Mars Volta shows that it can really pay off to try something different. <br /> <br />I think its safe to say that many people may not like this band from the very beginning, but I think its also safe to say that if you give them a chance, and keep listening, you will grow to not just like them, but love them. To me the whole album takes you on a journey, from start to finish it takes you through a while story. The album is fairly long, it starts with a sort of mysterious intro, leading you into the absolutly fantastic spine tingling Inertiatic Esp. The album slowly starts to take you away, you can't help but be drawn in and keep listening, you won't want to skip a single cord. By the time you're at the end, you'll know what I mean when I say it' like a journey in music, one that you will want to re-live over and over again, each time enjoying it that little bit more. <br /> <br />On closing comments, all thats left to say is The Mars Volta are an extremly refreshing band that will take you away from anything you've ever listened to before. It will show you that music can be so much more. This is one of those exceptionaly rare albums that you will absolutly love and listen to for years to come. It will be at the top of your favourite music collection and you'll never want to let any friend borrow it. Everyone who isn't a hardcore Britney spears fan with no open mind should try this album, everyone who loves rock MUST try this album.
B000002KHH|5.0|Black Sabbath's Paranoid is one of heavy metal's all-time classics. Paranoid is Ozzy and company's finest hour. Songs such as War Pigs, Paranoid,Iron Man, and Fairies Wear Boots highlight the album. Many of the tracks are played on classic rock radio these days. When you hear an album like Paranoid it's easy to hear why it's so influential to this day. Every metal fan should own this album, cause folks Sabbath is one of the groups that created heavy metal, if it weren't for these guys Metallica, Slipknot, your favorite metal band, etc would not exist. So don't be afraid and check out the CD that helped the genre get off the ground. You must own Black Sabbath's Paranoid!
B00006RINF|5.0|A few months ago, I think it was May, my friend invited me to go see Blindside and P.O.D. with him. I can't stand christian rock, but despite this I agreed to go. When I got their I learned that there were going to be a couple of opening bands, Lacuna Coil and Hazin Street(which sucked ass so i wont even talk about them). At the time I had no idea who Lacuna Coil was, but I was expecting them to be some not very well known christian band. I was so wrong. Before the Coil played their set they played a recording of a song(This is Halloween) from The Nightmare Before Christmas which was one of my favorite movies as a child. I instantly knew these guys were different. After the recording finished, 6 very scary looking people came onto the stage. (...) I remember those words well. Anyways they kicked off their set with Swamped. Cristina chose not to sing the intro(When your taught through feelings) and instead all 5 members standing members of Lacuna Coil were banging their heads to the metal chords. It looked amazing. Andrea started singing the verse. I was taken aback by how good he sounded. His voice is very haunting and it sounded perfect. At the time I didn't even know that Cristina was a girl, because she was banging her head the whole time, (...). But she raised her head and started belting the chorus. I almost passed out. Imagine an Amy Lee who has no range limits and is able to hit every note when she sings live. That is Cristina. All of the songs after swamped were amazing and I was disappointed that their set was so short. Needless to say the christian bands sucked. Anyways, I didn't end up buying Lacuna's CD because my christian friend was perturbed. And for some reason I forgot about Lacuna Coil until I heard they were going to be on the Ozzfest line-up a couple months later. I was pumped. Anyways, their set at Ozzfest was only slightly longer then their set at the christian show, much to my disappointment. But this time I was able to meet Lacuna Coil and get their autographs which was very cool. I also figured after seeing them play live twice and thoroughly enjoying it each time, it was time to get their cd. I did so and It is everything their live shows are. Every song is perfect or near-perfect. Here is a breakdown of the Highlights.    Swamped: 10/10 A perfect track to open the CD.  Heaven's a Lie: 9/10 Amazing verse and nice harmonies on the chorus.  Daylight Dancer: 10/10 One of my favorite tracks on the CD. Very evil sounding and great singing from both Andrea and Cristina.  Tight Rope: 9/10 Some very awesome double kick rhythms on the chorus and great lyrics and singing harmonies.  The Ghost Woman and the Hunter: 10/10 A track I never ended up hearing played live. Cristina sings the whole thing with no help from Andrea and does it perfectly.  Entwined: 10/10 Christina sings most of this haunting song, but Andrea pitches in some on the chorus for some very awesome sounding vocals.  The Prophet Said: 9/10 Andrea sings two verses and Cristina sings the rest of this rather long song. Very excellent guitarwork, drums, and vocals.  Comalies: 11/10 The longest song on the album. The verses are sung in Italian and it sounds spectacular, especially the second one. The rest features amazing guitarwork and the chorus is absolutely moving. Cristina has an unmatchable voice. This is my favorite song on the album, the first time I heard it, I was moved to tears. It's an amazing experience everytime you hear it. trust me.    Just because I skipped a track here and there doesnt mean they are bad. It just means that they are worth 7-8/10 not one song on this album is worth less then a 7.    Heres the inevitable evanescence comparison: I personally was never that big of a fan of evanescence. I have heard every song off fallen and am not wowed at all. The only one of their songs that I think is up to par with LC is Tournequette. But the rest just aren't as good because    1. Amy Lee just doesn't have as good of a voice as Cristina Scabbia. I have seen both band's live and Amy struggles to hold a key live while Cristina does it effortlessly.    2. Evanescence has no male singer to add complexity.    3. While some may say the vocals on Comalies sound washed out by the guitars, I think that was the original intent of the band. Evanescences vocals drown out the guitarwork making their guitars boring on Fallen, but you can tell the guitarists in LC have skill because you can actually hear them.    4. The drumming is better.    Buy this if you are a fan of heavy metal or evanescence.
B000002O51|4.0|It took Tom Scholtz 8 years to finish Boston's Third album Third Stage. By the time of it's release Scholtz and Brad Delp were the only members left from the original line up.Third Stage starts off with the ballad Amanda, and from that point it just rocks on. Third Stage doesn't really have the same sound as 1976's Boston or 78's Don't Look Back, but I think most Boston fans would enjoy Third Stage just as well.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|This latest \\"The Best Of The Talking Heads\\" is a good collection for the casual fan, but for a better retrospective of the band the two cd collection \\"Sand In The Vaseline\\" (also remastered) is a better choice. This single disc collection does lack the hit \\"I Zimbra\\" which definately should have been included. The Talking Heads most popular hits (less \\"I Zimbra\\") such as \\"Psycho Killer\\", \\"Life During Wartime\\", \\"Take Me To The River\\", \\"Burning Down The House\\" and \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" are all included as well as \\"Love Building On Fire\\", \\"Uh-Oh, Love Comes To Town\\", \\"Found A Job\\" plus ten more tracks. The remastering is excellent with increased bass, midrange and extended output. If you enjoy seventies new wave such as Blondie, The Ramones, The Damned to name a few then you'll enjoy this collection.
B00005J73X|3.0|On the spine it says Bon Jovi One Wild Night Live 1985-2001, what a rip! Runaway and In and out of love are the only songs on the album recorded at a concert from the 80's, the rest was recorded in 1995 and 2000. You'd think Bon Jovi would use material from the Slippery When Wet and New Jersey tours since during those two tours Bon Jovi was at their peak in popularity, but instead were given tracks from the Keep the Faith and Crush tours. While most the album is good, Jon's voice is weaker then it used to be just play the first 4 albums and you'll hear what I mean. Besides many of Bon Jovi's biggest hits missing there are a couple of covers we could have done without, and songs like Someday I'll be Saturday and Just older aren't in the same league as their classics and where is Bed of Roses. I'm sure a Bon Jovi concert is a lot better than this album. They should have made a two cd set, so they could include the more essential tunes.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Ok now I am a big Star Wars fan. I understand how all the fan boys thinks George Lucas is ruining Star Wars, but That's not true. I mean he's not striping the whole movie and re doing it with new real people.It still has the great story but, it  is now beatiful to the eye. I hope you fan boys change your mind and give it a chance.
B00008WT5C|3.0|1977 Ac/dc released their album Let There Be Rock. Let there be Rock featured the great guitar boogie of Whole Lotta Rosie and Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be.Also included is Problem Child,Bad Boy Boogie, and Let There Be Rock.Let There Be Rock is a good early effort for Ac/dc, it ranks way above most of the Brian Johnson era albums, but at this point Ac/Dc didn't quite perfect their songwriting skills.
B0002DB52M|3.0|I just want to say here and now that \\"Dogville\\" is the first(and so far only) Lars Von Trier film I've seen, and the first time I'd even heard of the man. That said, I won't be comparing this film to any of his previous ones, since I haven't seen them. <br /> <br />\\"Dogville\\" is not for the easily offended. It is also not for the easily bored. It is a fascinating, frustrating, beautifully made intellectual film that's really good if you have patience with it. I know lots of reviewers have described the film in such a way that it might be a turnoff to some viewers, but allow me to explain. <br /> <br />First of all, the film is shot entirely on a soundstage, and performed in the style of \\"Our Town\\". Those who haven't seen \\"Our Town\\" might be a little confused when they see invisible doors being opened and closed, but after a while, the viewer gets used to, even apriciates, the simplicity of the set. There are quite a few camera shots that are beautiful to watch, even if the scene itself is almost unbearable, and, surprsingly, there's a lot of opportunity for symbolism on the director's innovative set, especially at the end. <br /> <br />Secondly, just about every reviewer has said that the film is blatantly anti-american. I saw none of that here. It is simply about human nature, and how corruptible we all can be. That said, it's probably best at this point if I explain the plot. <br /> <br />The story centers around a mysterious young fugitive named Grace(Nicole Kidman) who arrives in the tiny mountain town of Dogville. She is immediately taken in by Tom(Paul Bettany), a young philosopher who decides to use Grace as a lesson in trying to teach tolerance to his fellow townspeople. Grace helps the citizens of Dogville and attempts to befriend them. The townspeople accept Grace, first reluctantly, then seemingly wholeheartedly. But after a wanted poster featuring the town's newest resident is posted, the townspeople gradually turn on grace, first raping her, then enslaving her, then chaining her up and turning her in to the gangsters she was running from at the start of the film. Even Tom, who eventually falls in love with Grace shows his true colors and sides with the townspeople on the issue after trying to force himself on her.  <br /> <br />The film ends in a rather odd way that, though unexpected, doesn't really seem right, and is never truly explained. Indeed, even when I listened to the director's commentary for an explanation as to the film's ending, it seemed that Von Trier himself didn't really have an explanation for it, other than \\"it was just the way the story had to end\\".  <br /> <br />So that brings us back to film's constant criticism of being very anti-American. First, keep in mind that Von Trier himself is not American, so therefore has every right to make an anti-American film if he so wishes. Also, as I said before, I really didn't say any parts that I thought showed the United States as a whole in a really unfavorable light. It seems that simply because the characters and setting are in the United States, people tend to assume that the film must therefore be anti-American. Again, I'll refer back to the director's commentary. What I took away from that was that Von Trier was not trying to poke sadistic fun at Americans, but that he had made each part of the plot and the film simply because he thought it was artistic. <br /> <br />The film ends with David Bowie's \\"Young Americans\\" with a montage of pictures of poverty-stricken people, which Von Trier says were part of the research that went into the film. I'm not quite sure what to think of this montage, other than that it was really odd, and probably so intellectual and artistic that I wouldn't get it. <br /> <br />But my last problem with the film(and the real reason, other than the ending that I gave it three stars) is that the message it gives is that in life there is no hope, only pain and revenge. \\"Dogville\\" is, at it's heart, a cold, painful movie, thoughthere are happy parts. But these few moments of joy are so rare and so short that I thought Von Trier just shoved them in there to keep people from walking out of the theater so that he could move on the more pain and evil and suffering. <br /> <br />Anyway, \\"Dogville\\" should be seen with at least one other person, if not a group, because it makes for some very interesting conversation afterwards. Are humans really the greedy, conniving creatures that Von Trier makes them out to be? Is there a limit to how many times a person can bring themselves to forgive somebody else? If so, where is the line drawn? Just how nasty were all those rape scenes?  <br /> <br />So, though it's not exactly a film to be watched solely for entertainment, I do highly reccomend \\"Dogville\\" to those people who enjoy movies that make them think.
B000002B7O|5.0|With Diary of a Madman, Ozzy released a second masterpiece in 1981. Sadly this would be the last studio album for Rhandy Roads who was killed in a plane crash during the 1982 tour. Diary of a Madman opens with the sonic assualt of Over the Mountain. Then Flying High Again,You Can't Kill Rock and Roll etc. Diary of a Madman offers up a serving of great songs. How many people can have a whole album that is this good all the way through. Diary of a Madman is quite an accomplishment condsidering it and the Blizzard of Ozz were released in the same year. This is essential hard rock/metal for everyone. Beware the 2002 had rerecorded bass and drum parts, and it is noticeable, stick with the 80's release or the 1995 remasters.
0393035158|5.0|This book is one of the most rational, disturbing, and ultimately inspiring documents I have ever read.  Harris goes head-on against religious dogmatism and political correctness to deliver a shattering blow to our collective stupidity.  It is long past time someone wrote a book like this.  Who knows if there are any people of faith with the guts to read it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|When my girlfriend handed me this DVD, she told me nothing about it.  Based on the title, I figured it would be nothing more than some drama based on some lackluster dreams; and I was right and wrong at the same time.  What I did see was dreams being accomplished and smashed into pieces in the same moment.  Requiem for a Dream is a film you must see. <br />    I started watching this film not expecting much of a masterpiece, but I was soon to discover that I was viewing one of the most brutally honest and disturbing films ever to be created, and I do not say that lightly. <br />Now, I am well aware that my previous statement has been said many; many times in just about every one of the seven hundred some reviews on this site.  What more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?  The musical score is incredible, the editing is something that can't be matched in any other film, and the acting is top notch on every level.  I sat on my couch while the credits rolled in awe, almost drawn to tears; with a blank look on my face.  I wasn't able to sleep the night I saw this film.  I was thinking long into the night about random things; trying to process the things I had just seen; and I continued to do so late into the next day. <br />     Now, I must note that I had watched this film right after I got done watching Pi.  I suggest anyone who likes either film should see the other.  They are both from the same director and they are both mind-blowingly good. <br /> <br />Be warned, this is one film you have to see twice to fully understand every little thing, but I can almost guarantee you that you will want to put it away and never see it again after the magnificent ending.
B00009QG73|5.0|Responding to someone's earlier review mentioning having the <br />sound fade in/out during playback, I had the same issue and <br />realized, playing it on my new PC with DVD drive, that since <br />I didn't have a 5.1 or 6.1 setup as yet, just a good pair of  <br />Altec Lansing pc speakers, I had to go into the DVD <br />menu and set the sound for Dolby stereo 2.0 instead of the  <br />5.1 mixes included herein.  Then the sound suddenly became spectacular and stopped fading out. Those with surround systems will probably want to set the sound for the proper surround mix, or you might get similar fade problems.  The credits mention that the great Rhett Davies (who was worked with Roxy Music many times before as producer and engineer) designed the sound mix for this DVD, and he definitely knows what he's doing because in the proper mix, this DVD sounds unbelievable--it has few or none of the problems inherent (normally) in live concerts recorded for video or DVD.  A few times Bryan's vocal mike could've been mixed a bit louder, but otherwise, it's spot-on dynamic. Paul Thompson's drums in particular sound larger-than-life, as if you're sitting right next to his drum kit! <br />I can only imagine what the 5.1 mixes sound like, I hope  <br />I get to find out soon though. <br />   As for the DVD itself, I watched this again the other night <br />in its entirety, and I caught both the 2001 and 2003 NYC <br />shows on the tour, at Radio City and the MSG Garden Theatre, <br />and this DVD brings me right back to both of those shows, <br />as if I'm there again in the audience.  Easily one of the  <br />greatest live concert DVDs or videos I've ever seen. <br />Most of them suck, but this one delivers the goods and then <br />goes beyond it to become a truly moving experience. <br />A band at the top of their form and captured on a dazzling  <br />DVD.  This a must-own if you're any kind of Roxy Music fan. <br />The DVD also includes some great extras, a mini-pre-tour  <br />warmup documentary with backstage footage and interviews, <br />and even full lyrics you can set to play on/off during each <br />song or the entire concert.  Outro/credits music is even <br />great, utilizing the instrumental song \\"India\\" from the great Roxy Avalon album (1982).
B0000TLA9G|2.0|To make a greatest hits cd and put it on one disc was a HUGE mistake.  Guns n Roses has so many great and essential songs that a greatest hits album would have to be at least to discs worth of music.  Even then it wouldn't cover all of their essential tracks.  Guns n Roses only came out with three albums of origional material and i wouldn't count on Chinese Democracy.  Axl may still controll the name but GnR isnt GnR without Slash Duff and Izzy.  My suggestion would be to buy a copy of Appetite For Destruction.  You will leave that in your sterio for at least 2 months, i'll gaurentee it.  Every track on that album is worthy of a greatest hits cd.  Then if you like Guns n Roses buy the Use Your Illusion's.  Those albums have a ton of great songs on them too. Then they Live albums are great.

B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This is a great cd!! With catchy songs & great lyrics, it always makes me sing along while at the same time make me think. <br /> <br />Well... i never can understand how you can rate a cd wholistically (?spell?) so here's a track-by-track review... <br /> <br />1-Jacqueline-(10/10)- After the accoustic intro (which is pretty good after you have listened to the song a few times) it goes into a melody without vocals. & you think to yourself... well this is gonna stink... b/c when the vocals come in it's gonna ruin everything because it certainly can't get any better... but then it blows your mind away because it gets even better!! GREGOR WAS DOWN AGAIN SAID COME ON KICK ME AGAIN... <br /> <br />2-Tell Her Tonight-(1/10)- well... after something as good as jacqueline you expect something better and way less annoying. This song is nauseating to me because i think they were drunk maybe when they wrote this and decided that you don't have to actually sing with a good voice to make a good song. I really don't like it. <br /> <br />3-Take Me Out-(9/10)- This is the song that i bought the cd for. The only reason i didn't give it a 10/10 is because it gets kind of repetitive towards the end... but it is still a great song! <br /> <br />4-The Dark Of The Matinee-(10/10)- I really like this song... it's kind of different than the rest of the songs on this cd & it's really good. I really like it when they switch from 4/4 time to 6/8 time in the last verse. (okay, okay, i know im a band dork.... most of y'all won't get that time signature thing but maybe some of you will) <br /> <br />5-Auf Auchse-(8/10)- This is a great song... but that's really all there is to say about it. It's not really anything great or special, but it is really good. <br /> <br />6-Cheating On You-(7/10)- I really like the beginning... but then when the vocals come in it's very repetitive. I just don't like how it's so repetitive. Yeah, it is really repetitive. It just kind of repeats itself over & over again. It doesn't do anything new but just the same stuff. (yeah that's how repetitive it is) <br /> <br />7-This Fire-(10/10)- This is a great song... it sounds like it would be from like the 70's or something... it's really really good! <br /> <br />8-Darts Of Pleasure-(10/10)- This song is great! It changes a lot but doesn't really... listen to it & you'll understand. The best part is when they switch to german at the end! ICH HEISSE SUPER FANTASTICHE! ICH TRINKE CHAMPERS MIT LACHSFICHSE! <br /> <br />9-Micheal-(8/10)- This song is great musically but then you look up the lyrics & it's like... oh. This song is about like a gay strip club & stuff. it's.... interesting. <br /> <br />10-Come On Home-(10/10)- I love this song!! The lyrics are exactly how i felt when my girlfriend & i broke up a week ago... it's scary - - i think that song was written for me. lol. <br /> <br />11-40'-(8/10)- A great song but again, it doesn't stand out. <br /> <br /> <br />So that's my opinion. But the verdict is... go out & buy this cd if you like good music... & really... whatever kind of music you like i think you'll like this cd!!
0316776963|5.0|The title story of this collection never fails to send me into fits of laughter, and I am not one to laugh easily. If you have not heard David Sedaris on the radio, then you really must try to see him at one of his readings or book signings. His stories are best heard out loud, and no one tells them better than Sedaris himself. That being said, the written stories are excellent and this collection in particular must be owned.<br /><br />The standard Sedaris fare is here as he mercilessly picks on the members of his own family (as well as on himself) for humor's sake. My favorite stories, however, all concern his misadventures in France among the French as well as among the Americans he meets abroad. His sadistic French teacher (of several stories including the title story) and the American couple on the subway who assume he is French and speak openly about him in English are just classic foils for Sedaris's misanthropic character. Humor writing doesn't get any better than this.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt
B0002I831S|4.0|Never having shelled out the money for the previously released tapes or DVDs, I was thrilled when Paramount announced the release of boxed sets from ST:TOS and I preordered all three. <br /> <br />I was a little disappointed. The episodes are *not* remastered. It looks as if they may have cleaned up the opening title sequence and closing credits but that's about it. <br /> <br />A little personal nit-pik for me is they have ordered the episodes in their original air date sequence, not the order in which they were shot. I can understand why they would do that but I would have rather seen them in the order they were shot to better see the evolution of the series as it progressed. <br /> <br />Lastly, the packaging is pretty flimsy and most likely won't last long under constant use. <br /> <br />Overall, I'm glad I bought this set but it could have been *so* much better. <br />

B0002IU988|4.0|Yeah, i get it, Scott Staff loved his wife and kids and all that and it was really lovely....to bad he shelled out miserably whiny ballads that were hard to stomach.  After ditching Scott, the remaing members of Creed formed a new band with a new singer and a definatively new sound.  \\"One Day Remains\\" is lightyears ahead of anything Creed ever released.  The guitars are more complex and intense and Myles Kennedy is much less whiny than Staff, a huge upgrade as far as i'm concerned.  Even the sappy ballads have a harder feel to them.  Tremonti really shines on the album as a top-tier guitarist and Kennedy does a nice job ripping off guys like Eddie Vedder and Chris Cornell.  All in all, its a great album that anyone looking for a solid rock album should consider.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Just leave Muse alone! They're a fantastic band, and they aren't just Radiohead copycats. Absolution is a beautifully put together album, and there is one thing about this CD that is amazing: EVERY SINGLE SONG IS FANTASTIC. And that is a a very rare thing to find in a CD. With most of my CD's, I like them, but I don't LOVE every single song. With this album, it's different. Every song is outstanding. After origin of symmetry, I asked myself \\"How do you beat this?!\\" With Absolution, that's how. Just listen to it, and let Matt Bellamy take you away to a magical fantasy land where there are no irritating people comparing Muse to Radiohead...Bliss.

078324228X|5.0|Rubin Carter was wrongfully imprisoned before I was even born, and I'm sure I am one of many who first learned of his shocking case through the telling words of Bob Dylan's song \\"Hurricane.\\"  Dylan was one of many who believed in Carter's innocence and helped raise awareness of the gross injustice he suffered at the hands of the justice system in New Jersey.  I do not know all of the facts in the actual case, but I am aware of the fact that this film does not follow the history of events exactly - it's no secret, as a disclaimer of such appears at the beginning of the movie.  This is not a documentary; it's a moving tale of prejudice, corruption, and hatred ultimately defeated by love, truth, and honor; as such, it captures the heart and spirit of Carter's tragic story in the most powerful of ways.<br /><br />You could call what happened to Rubin Carter a travesty of justice, yet even this term barely begins to explain Carter's plight.  He was tried and convicted of the murder of three individuals in a New Jersey bar in 1967 for two reasons: he was black and he was successful.  He and a fan were heading home in a white car when they were pulled over, hauled over to a murder scene they knew nothing about and then to the hospital to see if anyone could identify them as the murderers - which no one did.  This did not stop the lead detective from arresting and trying them for murder - by suppressing evidence and forging documents, not to mention engineering the false testimony of quite impeachable witnesses, the police and prosecutors got their conviction.  Rubin Carter's boxing career was over, and this man - who could have been the middle-weight champion of the world - found himself looking at three life sentences for a crime he did not commit.<br /><br />Much of this film examines Carter's response to the crushing weight of prison and the repeated denials of his appeals over two decades (somewhat strangely, it mentions but does not dramatize the second trial he managed to get - and lose).  Along the way, we flash back to the important events of Carter's childhood and early adulthood - including some of his overpowering victories in the ring.  Another story converges with Carter's as the movie progresses, though.  A young man from Brooklyn, who has been taken under the wing of three working partners in Toronto - who teach him to read and help him prepare for the college education he longs to have - buys Carter's autobiography at a used book sale - it's the first book he has ever bought.  Reading Carter's story, young Lesra Martin feels a close connection to the man and decides to write him a letter.  A friendship emerges between Carter and Martin, and eventually Martin's Toronto friends and teachers all risk their careers if not their very lives to help Carter win his release from prison.  Even though you know how the story turns out, the final scenes are wondrous moments of cinematic art full of raw emotional power.<br /><br />This movie does run a little long, coming in at just under two and a half hours, but you'll be so absorbed by the story you won't even realize how much time passes.  Denzel Washington does a remarkable job as Ruben Carter, and the supporting cast is stellar as well.  Hurricane affects you across the whole range of emotions: hatred for the crooked cops and prosecutors, disgust with those who not only feel racism but use it as a weapon to subvert justice and ruin a man, growing admiration for Carter as he deals with year upon year of incarceration, deep respect for those who risk their own livelihoods in order to open the eyes of Lady Justice, and the moving joy of hope fulfilled and the eventual triumph of good over evil.  The film may not be historically accurate in all its details, but Hurricane is about as real as it gets.  This is just an extraordinary motion picture.he managed to get - and lose).

0062502182|3.0|The Alchemist was a nice parable about persuing your dreams. I liked the characters, and the story flow was fitting. I liked many of the points the story made about life. I would suggest this book for people who are still questing for what their life journey is. <br /> <br />I only gave this book three stars because of certain features. The book reminded me a lot of The Little Prince by Antoine DeSaint Exupery. While the point of the two books differ sleightly, the tone and feel is very simular. However, The Little Prince has a charm that The Alchemist lacks. Plus, The Alchemist is good for one read, but a re-read is quite unnessisary. With The Little Prince you want to go back time after time to read. <br /> <br />The Alchemist is good if it was a gift or you are giving a gift. Otherwise just pick it up at the library or used for a few cents.
B00005JNEI|4.0|Michael Moore always has a witty way to approach things such as his ice cream truck stunt (where he reads the PATRIOT act to congress through an ice cream truck's speakers because they didnt read it). It really get's you thinkin' which is good today because it seems that there is so much dribble on TV and in the movies, but his fight is very one-sided.  <br />I suggest that anyone, be you Republican, Democrat or Green, that see's this movie also read what the Republican-Conservative enemy has to say as well. Slander-By Ann Coulter is a pretty fierce Conservative book that combats many of the things people like Al Franken and Michael Moore say. Just do your own research as well as watch this movie and develop you own opinion to the topics it brings up.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Everwood... It is my favorite show on television.  Being in high school it is a show that i can really relate to.  I always watch it with my mom and sister, it is a really good show to watch with family members, especially pre-teens and teens.  WB Monday's at 9 eastern... watch it! :-)
B0001D0FTW|5.0|Edguy's sixth record, Hellfire Club (2004) is their best record yet. Why? Because it shows that Tobi knows when a band has to evolve. Being a pretty big power metal fan, I do know of power metal bands who seem to run out of original ideas. On this record, Tobi, Dirk, Jens, \\"Eggi,\\" and Felix have emerged with a sound that is fresh compared to the stuff portrayed on, say, Mandrake (2001), but not a RADICALLY altered sound, which is what ruins many great bands like Queensryche, Metallica, and Dio (though he quickly returned to his roots.) But anyway, the album is among my favorite albums from this year so far, maybe not quite as good as, say, Exodus's Tempo Of The Damned, but still very good.<br /><br />And now, the key part of all my music reviews: the three highlights of the album. Track 2, \\"The Piper Never Dies,\\" is an excellent haunting epic (10 minutes, 5 seconds.) Overall, opening track \\"Mysteria\\" just doesn't have the razor-edged finesse of \\"Piper Never Dies.\\" Track 5, \\"King Of Fools,\\" was the song that introduced me to Edguy after streaming it on the Nuclear Blast website, though not a frantic speed metal tune, it's still a great song, I even learned to play it on bass! And track 8, \\"Lavatory Love Machine,\\" almost has a glam metal feel to it, it's also a hilarious video, I saw it on the Nuclear Blast Europe website. Overall, highly recommended for fans of Edguys's past releases, Kingdom Of Madness, Vain Glory Opera, Theater Of Salvation, Savage Poetry, and Mandrake. Also recommended for fans of Tobi's Avantasia project (god knows I love 'em!) as well as other German power metal bands, like Helloween, Gamma Ray, and Blind Guardian. Later fellow headbangers!
B0000214F2|5.0|Having read quite a few reviews on this movie, I realize that many of the people who have watched and reviewed this movie were just out looking for a good story, or wanted to see Robin Williams in his wonderful, comedic role.  Not that they are wrong, for this movie does provide a good measure of both. <br /> <br />Having viewed this movie numerous times, and having seen quite a few Robin Williams movies, I have to add here, that there is a hidden dimension to this and other Robin Williams movies. <br /> <br />I think that most of Robin Williams's movies contain within them a cutting, critical, social comment that can often be overlooked due to the off-beat humor and story lines.  In this particular movie, the theme is set up early on in the scene in the mental institution where he encounters the gentleman who asks him how many fingers he is holding up.  The answer to that question is the heart of the social commentary in this film, and is carried out, amplified, and experimented with through out the remainder of the scenes and subplots.  To fail to fully comprehend the social commentary in this film is to lose at least 90 percent of its meaning, leaving the viewer with nothing but a somewhat predictible, stereotyped movie with a bit of fun humor. <br /> <br />As a minister, this movie reminded me at a critical time, what it was that I was all about.  I have since used it to teach, and have found my students to be similarly moved when examining the intricasies of the theme. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this to everyone who ever will have anything to do with people care.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Don't believe everything you see.  Michael Moore is very one sided and has one goal.  Do your own research and make an informed decision not one based on crap you see in a movie.    Fahrenheit 9/11 begins on election night 2000. We are first shown Al Gore rocking on stage with famous musicians and a high-spirited crowd. The conspicuous sign on stage reads \\"Florida Victory.\\" Moore creates the impression that Gore was celebrating his victory in Florida. Moore's voiceover claims, \\"And little Stevie Wonder, he seemed so happy, like a miracle had taken place.\\" The verb tense of past perfect (\\"had taken\\") furthers the impression that the election has been completed.    Actually, the rally took place in the early hours of election day, before polls had even opened. Gore did campaign in Florida on election day, but went home to Tennessee to await the results. The \\"Florida Victory\\" sign reflected Gore's hopes, not any actual election results. (\\"Gore Campaigns Into Election Day,\\" Associated Press, Nov. 7, 2000.)  The film shows CBS and CNN calling Florida for Al Gore. According to the narrator, \\"Then something called the Fox News Channel called the election in favor of the other guy....All of a sudden the other networks said, 'Hey, if Fox said it, it must be true.'\\"    We then see NBC anchor Tom Brokaw stating, \\"All of us networks made a mistake and projected Florida in the Al Gore column. It was our mistake.\\"  Moore thus creates the false impression that the networks withdrew their claim about Gore winning Florida when they heard that Fox said that Bush won Florida.     In fact, the networks which called Florida for Gore did so early in the evening-before polls had even closed in the Florida panhandle, which is part of the Central Time Zone. NBC called Florida for Gore at 7:49:40 p.m., Eastern Time. This was 10 minutes before polls closed in the Florida panhandle. Thirty seconds later, CBS called Florida for Gore. And at 7:52 p.m., Fox called Florida for Gore. Moore never lets the audience know that Fox was among the networks which made the error of calling Florida for Gore prematurely. Then at 8:02 p.m., ABC called Florida for Gore. Only ABC had waited until the Florida polls were closed.   About an hour before the polls closed in panhandle Florida, the networks called the U.S. Senate race in favor of the Democratic candidate. The networks seriously compounded the problem because from 6-7 Central Time, they repeatedly announced that polls had closed in Florida--even though polls were open in the panhandle. (See also Joan Konner, James Risser & Ben Wattenberg, Television's Performance on Election Night 2000: A Report for CNN, Jan. 29, 2001.)  The false announcements that the polls were closed, as well as the premature calls (the Presidential race ten minutes early; the Senate race an hour early), may have cost Bush thousands of votes from the conservative panhandle, as discouraged last-minute voters heard that their state had already been decided; some last-minute voters on their way to the polling place turned around and went home. Other voters who were waiting in line left the polling place. In Florida, as elsewhere, voters who have arrived at the polling place before closing time often end up voting after closing time, because of long lines. The conventional wisdom of politics is that supporters of the losing candidate are most likely to give up on voting when they hear that their side has already lost. Thus, on election night 1980, when incumbent President Jimmy Carter gave a concession speech while polls were still open on the west coast, the early concession was blamed for costing the Democrats several Congressional seats in the West, such as that of 20-year incumbent James Corman. The fact that all the networks had declared Reagan a landslide winner while west coast voting was still in progress was also blamed for Democratic losses in the West; Congress even held hearings about prohibiting the disclosure of exit polls before voting had ended in the any of the 48 contiguous states.     Even if the premature television calls affected all potential voters equally, the effect was to reduce Republican votes significantly, because the Florida panhandle is a Republican stronghold. Most of Central Time Zone Florida is in the 1st Congressional District, which is known as the \\"Redneck Riviera.\\" In that district, Bob Dole beat Bill Clinton by 69,000 votes in 1996, even though Clinton won the state by 300,000 votes. So depress overall turnout in the panhandle, and you will necessarily depress more Republican than Democratic votes. A 2001 study by John Lott suggested that the early calls cost Bush at least 7,500 votes, and perhaps many more. Another study reported that the networks reduced panhandle turn-out by about 19,000 votes, costing Bush about 12,000 votes and Gore about 7,000 votes.    At 10:00 p.m., which networks took the lead in retracting the premature Florida win for Gore? They were CNN and CBS, not Fox. (The two networks were using a shared Decision Team.) See Linda Mason, Kathleen Francovic & Kathleen Hall Jamieson, \\"CBS News Coverage of Election Night 2000: Investigation, Analysis, Recommendations\\" (CBS News, Jan. 2001), pp. 12-25.)     In fact, Fox did not retract its claim that Gore had won Florida until 2 a.m.--four hours after other networks had withdrawn the call.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This tour de force is quirky, brilliant, baroque and yet readily accessible.  Rufus Wainwright is one of a kind, and his music defies labeling.  \\"Want One\\" is a masterpiece of composition, performance and production.  The centerpiece, \\"I Don't Know What It Is,\\" is flavored with influences as diverse as classical opera and The Beatles circa Sgt. Pepper.  Wainwright's genius is in embracing his eclectic tastes and blending them into a finished product that is unique and immensely enjoyable.
0060930187|4.0|The Bell Jar is a powerful coming of age story about the fictitious Esther Greenwood, whom author Sylvia Plath vicariously wrote as; and her struggle with societal expectations.  As an outcast, Esther moves to New York City in the 1950's to work for a magazine.  She deals with many life struggles causing her depression to worsen.  Her depressive characteristics; obsession with fetuses and the Rosenburgs, sexual experimentation, attempted suicide, and disregard for society's norms, land her in an institution.   <br /> Depression is a main theme of the novel along with personal growth (coming of age), society's restrictions on women, ethics of psychiatry, and cultural expectations. Esther is an anachronism, tied down by the prudish view on how women should be.  She is a modern thinker, and sadly, not accepted for that.   <br /> Sylvia Plath's cries from hell were evident in this eerily realistic novel.  She wrote to the depressives and to those who can understand what she was dealing with.  Presenting the never-ending conflict of Esther vs. society and convention, Plath made it  very easy to fall into character and feel trapped under the very same \\"bell jar\\" of madness.  <br /> I enjoyed reading The Bell Jar because it was so real and easy to relate to.  Although it was a bit depressing at times, it wasn't whiny or pretentious.  I highly recommend The Bell Jar for those who enjoy sociology, psychology, or just a good read. This compelling novel shouldn't be missed.

So here is the down side the price, but if you are like me <br />bought all the dolls (mego) from the 70s had the toy Phaser had the fold up enterprise and know <br />Kirk's middle initial stands for, the price is just an afterthought.    LIVE LONG AND PROSPER
B00005JLSE|4.0|I deliberately waited this long to watch this movie.  Many of my friends went to watch this movie in the cinemas and they told me it's good.  Then, \\"Chicago\\" won six Oscars.  Still, I relented.  To me, a good movie would be that it's still watchable and enjoyable years after it's released.  The decision was a good one.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was simply spectacular in her role as Velma.  Her background in musical showed through.  Her experience and her confidence oozed through & thus, her personality suited Velma to the dots and tees.  Renee was also brilliant in her role as Roxie but one couldn't help noticing her cautiousness in doing the numbers.  However, her presence was so relevant to the twenties.  Richard Gere, Reilly, Queen Latifah were all excellent in their roles.  What made their performances even more admirable was that all of them sang and danced through \\"Chicago\\" and they were all amateurs before this.  The additional features let us have a better appreciation of the casts in their roles by tireless and countless rehearsals.  Whilst the razzle dazzle was impressive, the movie had a serious undertone, the analysis of the change of America's society.  We were brought to the attention of women's enpowerment, the power and people's vanity towards media's exploitation, greed, indiscretion.  \\"Chicago\\" was every bit a show-stopper and it's a DVD collection worth having at home.  Highly recommended.
B00008OLYN|4.0|Never saw this one coming, though in retrospect it was almost impossible to miss. Opeth have always been heavily influenced by strange, 70's music so it shouldn't have been a surprise when they released an album emulating it. Pretty good mellow music, nice to listen to when your hung over. There is nothing heavy about this cd so people who only like the harder aspects of Opeth should stay away. If you like the softer parts of Opeth than you'll love this cd. Steve Wilson, from Porcupine Tree (an obvious influence for this album) produced the disc and does a bit of singing on it. Sounds nice, if you like this album I would recommend checking out Porcupine Tree since their entire catalog is music similar to this. Overall, Damnation is a nice change that hopefully won't be permanent.
0790740443|4.0|Kurt Russell plays Sgt. Todd, #3465, among the first genetically engineered soldiers born and raised to fight.  After many years, decades even, of loyal and effective service, a new generation of soldier has been developed.  The new generation is stronger with faster reflexes.  Of course, in the world of movies there must be a drawback.  The drawback is that the new generation has too much arrogance, too little experience, and perhaps way too little common sense.<br /><br />After a demonstration between the new soldiers, one which has little to do with fighting in the real world, Sgt. Todd is apparently dead and is dropped onto an uninhabited trash world; a huge open-air landfill for civilizations across the inhabited space of mankind.  However, Sgt. Todd quickly discovers that the trash world is not uninhabited.<br /><br />A group of pioneers crashlanded on the planet on the way to another planet, and no one knows they are there.  Sgt. Todd has no reason to behave as a soldier towards these people; they do not threaten him and in fact welcome him to their homes.  Eventually they come to distrust his soldierly mein and boot him out of their settlement.<br /><br />By a complete and bizarre coincidence, the new generation of genetically engineered soldiers has been sent to the trash planet to eradicate the squatters, who are somehow now armed and dangerous, at least so far as the soldiers have been told.  Of course, even though Sgt. Todd has been booted out of the settlement, he cares for these people and returns to defend them, showing that in actual combat experience and creativity will outweigh sheer strength as long as the odds are somewhat reasonable.<br /><br />Kurt's character is a perfect blend of Spock and any action hero you care to name.  He kills only when necessary, and he has an incredible code of honor.  His code of honor extends only to those who act honorably, as we discover in the movie.<br /><br />The movie is uncharacteristic in that is relies more on the development of Sgt. Todd's character than on special effects and action.  The suspense near the end is a bit overly dramatic in places, with more than a little hokum, but in the end the movie is effective and enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are looking for another variation on the theme of \\"Mad Max\\" and \\"The Road Warrior,\\" with a character who is nearly unemotional, then this movie may fit the bill.elies more on the development of Sgt.

B00008BXJG|5.0|I   am   a   real   big   fan   of   AC/DC, especially   of   the   Bon  Scott  era, and   I   gotta   say   that   this   is   easily   Bon's   best   album.  To   tell  you   why, I'm  gonna   describe  every   song   on   here   and   rate   them   from   my   personal   favorite  to   my   least   favorite. <br /> <br />Highway  to  Hell- Bon's  best  song  ever!!!  Rudd's   drumming   on  this   song   is   at   its   peak   and   so   are   Angus  and  Malcom's  riffs.  This  is   one   of   AC/DC's  most   recognizable  tunes.  DON'T   WORRY!!  THIS   SONG  ISN'T  TALKING  ABOUT   ACTUALLY  GOING  TO  HELL!!!!!! <br /> <br />Girl's  Got  Rhythem-  The  two  best  songs  on  here  are  delivered  back  to   back.  This  song  has  another   real  great  beat.  Bon  delivers  great  lyrics  on  here  along  with  Angus  delivering   a  real  catchy  tune. <br /> <br />Touch  Too  Much- Your  typical  Bon  song, and  I  don't  mean  that  in  a  negative  way.  This   song  not  only  has  a  great  beat, but  it  is  also   quite  funny, as  are  many  of  Bon's  songs.  Terrific  lyrics  and  wit  on  this  song. <br /> <br />Shot  Down  In  Flames- Another  fast  paced  and  hilarious  song.  This  song  is  talking  about  getting  rejected  and  yet  keeps  a  real  upbeat  kinda  tune.  Once  again, Bon  and  Angus  are  what  really  give  this  song  its  energy. <br /> <br />Walk  All  Over  You-  Surprisingly, it's   Malcom  who  really  stands  out  on  this  song.  Malcom's  rhythemic  guitar  gives  a  kind  of  manic  tempo  to  this  song.  Bon's  clever  ending  is  particularly   good  here. <br /> <br />Beating  Around  The  Bush-  This  song  to  me  is  a   more  heavy  metal  version  of  Led  Zeppelin's  \\"Black  Dog\\".  As  usual  Bon   delivers  very  seductive  lyrics. <br /> <br />Night  Prowler- One  of  the  eeriest   AC/DC  songs.  A  real  great  ending  to  the  album.  By  the  way, THIS  SONG  IS  NOT  TALKING  ABOUT  MURDERINGSOMEONE  OKAY!!!! <br /> <br />If  You  Want  Blood- A  real  hard  rocker.  A  love  the  beat  and  chorus  on  this  song.  The  only  bad  thing  about  this  song  is  it  is  a  little  freaky. <br /> <br />Love  Hungry  Man-  Another  of  Bon's  \\"seduction\\"  songs.  This  song  has  a  great  tempo   and  great  lyrics.  The  only  thing  I  don't  like  about  it  is  it's  a  little  too  repeatitive. <br /> <br />Get  It  Hot-  This  is  the  worst  song  on  here, but  it  is  still  a  great  song.  It  is  a  topnotch  song  to  dance  to.  It  just  doesn't  appeal  to  me  quite  as  much  as  the  other  songs  on  here  do. <br /> <br />There  is  not  a  truly  bad  song  on  here.  Bon's  career  could  not  have  ended  on  a  higher  note. We  still  love  you, Bon!!!  I  only  wish  that  he  had  gotten  to  see  how  popular  his  band  would  get  under  Brian  Johnson.   <br /> <br />I  also  recommend  the  following  AC/DC  albums: <br /> <br />Back  In  Black- Brian  Johnson's  best. <br /> <br />High  Voltage- Another  great  Bon  cd. <br /> <br />The  Razor's  Edge- Angus  is  at  his  best  on  this  later  AC/DC  album. <br /> <br />Live ( The  Collector's  Edition)- Brian  takes  on  the  role  of  performing  all  of  the  band's  best  songs  in  this  live  greatest  hits  cd.
B00005JLKN|4.0|I had already entered 1986's \\"Manhunter\\" into my personal cult film pantheon, and was worried that a remake would just screw up that fine movie.  I was pleasantly surprised that the producers of \\"Red Dragon\\" did the right thing and didn't attempt to take Manhunter on head-to-head, but instead to provide additional context to the Harris book.  Yes the ending was a cliche, but I think the writers' reasoning was that those who had already seen Manhunter needed to be surprised too.  I can respect that, and I think the ending was well done.<br /><br />Comparisons are inevitable, so here goes.  Brian Cox vs. Anthony Hopkins: very favorable, I think because the writers and producers had Sir Anthony on a much tighter leash than in Hannibal.  The role called for restraint and Hopkins delivers.  I particularly liked the first scene, where Graham realizes that Hannibal is a cannibalizing murderer.  Fans of the earlier movie may recall that Graham's realization is slightly different (in Manhunter, Graham glances at a book on war wounds, and realizes that Hannibal is the killer) but aesthetically the opening scene makes perfect logic in its own right.<br /><br />William Peterson vs. Edward Norton: both fine actors, with somewhat similar styles.  Mr. Norton is excellent in the role in the remake.  Mr. Peterson was more melodramatic (think: wiping hand on thigh while watching the Jacobi's home movie) but I believe that's more a function of writing as opposed to acting.<br /><br />Tom Noonon vs. Ralph Fiennes: both were excellent and believable in their roles as the psychopathic Francis Dollarhyde.  I suppose Noonon was a little bit higher octane, but that's again a function of writing as opposed to acting.<br /><br />Dennis Farina vs. Harvey Keital: I'm a *huge* fan of \\"Midnight Run\\" so I'm biased in favor of Dennis Farina.  I liked Dennis Farina better in the original.  He had a lot more energy than Mr. Keitel.<br /><br />Overall, the film is very enjoyable for both fans of Manhunter and those who have not seen the original.  I recommend it for all.  Like the Amazon.com review says, this film could have fallen into any of several pitfalls and it didn't.s of Manhunter and those who have not seen the original.  I recommend it for all.

B00008BXJJ|5.0|In   1992   in   Dunigton   Stadium,  AC/DC   produced   the   closest   thing   they   had   to   a   greatest   hits   album.  This   CD, in  my  opinion,  is   better   than  AC/DC's   earlier  attempt   at   a  greatest   hits   album, If  You  Want  Blood.  The  sound   is   unbelievably   rich   and   the   song   selections   are   almost   as   good   as  they   can   get, for   a   two  disc  album.  Every   song   on   here  is   great, with  the   exception   of   \\"The  Jack\\".  However,  there   are   several   flaws   in   this   album.  For   one   thing, it   is   live   so   therefore   their   music   sounds   a   little   different.  Another   thing   is   the   unbelievably    long   guitar   solos   get   annoying   after   awhile.  Last, I'm   sorry   Brian, but  you   just   can't   sing    like   you   used   to   man.  Even  though   there   are   several   flaws   in   this   album,  I  can't   help   but   give   a   cd   that   has   \\"Jailbreak\\", \\"Highway  to  Hell\\", \\"TNT\\", \\"Thunderstruck\\", \\"Hell's   Bells\\", and   \\"Money  Talks\\"  on  it  five  stars.  Some  songs  from   the  Bon  era  are  missing, but  other   than   that   this   is   the   most   thorough   AC/DC   greatest   hits   album   out   there.  Bon   would   have   been   real   proud   to   see   how   far   his   band   had   come. <br /> <br />I  also   recommend: <br /> <br />Back  In  Black-  Brian's   best   cd   by   far. <br /> <br />Highway   to   Hell-  Bon's  best  and  final  album. <br /> <br />The  Razor's  Edge-  The  last   of  the  great  AC/DC  cds. <br /> <br />High  Voltage-  One  of  AC/DC's  first  albums   and   Bon's   second   best  album. <br />

B00000DGRX|5.0|This is the best sounding remix I've ever heard. Roger Glover, the bass player on this session of what is considered the classic DP line up, has done a great job on the remix and has changed things up a bit by leaving in studio chatter, tune ups and not fading some of the songs as they were on the original version.  But you get the original version too with this package, so no complaints mate.  The remix breathes a huge amount of life into this classic album.  The drums and bass are big and punchy, the guitar is more powerful as is the organ. Most notable though is the way the band sounds together, there's space around the instruments and power, everything is clear and fits perfectly together.  It sounds like you're in the studio with the band playing right in front of you.  And its a visceral experience.  If you don't have this album, get it.  Its one of the '70s hard rock classics (Smoke on the Water, nuff said) and this package containing the original mix and the new punchier remix is well worth the price.  Space Truckin' just kicks major ass on this remix.
B000063JDE|5.0|This movie is truly genious. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that there were so many less than 5 star reviews, so i decided i had to contribute. From the first montages to  the last scene when the robins return this movie is brilliant all the way through. Kyle MacLaughlin gives a great performance as the college boy returned home to find that his father has suffered a heartattack. Later on he finds a key to a world he didn't know existed. This key opens to a world of extortion, mystery and of course blue velvet.<br /><br />  I'm not going to give you an outline of the plot like way too many people do on this site I'm just going to give two good reasons why you should watch this film and try to enjoy it. First off, in the future people are going to look at lynch like we look at dali today. Why? Because he's a brilliant brilliant man and he just won't get recognized for how brilliant he is in his time. Second, I think that this movie has some of the best performances that have ever been given. Dennis Hopper IS Frank Booth in this movie. He plays him so well, that its hard for me to imagine anyone else playing him. If those aren't reason enough than I'm not going to waste anymore effort on you.<br /><br /> And if this is your first time watching a lynch film, don't expect to enjoy it the first time through. Give it time and eventually you'll say to yourself one day damn that film was better than i gave it credit for. And thats when you'll know you're a lynch fanaddict
B000003TA4|5.0|i just like to start by saying that this is one of the bset albums i have ever heard,and to all the people who bad mouth this album and nirvana i just like to say to all of you , to get a life , this was one of the most popular albums of all time , so no matter how much you say nirvana suck or this album suck , well ever change that so get over it. now on that stupid retard mastershake not only do you need to get a life but you also need to get your facts straight too , how can you say nirvana rip off pom when pom was not even around , so either your not with the times or your just ****ing stupid, you pick one. back to nirvana , this is one of my favorite albums all the songs are good and i wish they were still around today, cause the music world today is a joke all it is , is band that rely on image and not talent , you want proof watch the vma's and you'll see that about 90% of it is no talent lip-singing. so this is what were stuck with until a another band like nirvana comes along. but back to nevermind this is a must have to any REAL music fan
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is an absolutely spellbinding Broadway album. I've yet to see the production, but this CD is truly wonderful.<br /><br />Idina Menzel is a goddess of the stage. Her Maureen in Rent was perfect, and in Wicked her Elphaba (from what I can gather from he album, at least) is every bit as good, if not better! Kristin Chenoweth also shines here: her beautiful voice can shift from operatic to pop-like and sound great in either way. Their duets are goose-bump inducing!<br /><br />There are so many great songs on this album (My favorites are \\"What is this Feeling\\", \\"Dancing Through Life\\", \\"Popular\\", \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" [the prettiest song on here, and maybe the most beautiful since Phantom of the Opera's \\"Music of the Night\\"], \\"Defying Gravity\\", \\"As Long as You're Mine\\", \\"No Good Deed\\", and \\"Because I knew You\\"): it's one of the best musical purchases I've made in years.<br /><br />There are a few tracks that I tend to skip, but I wouldn't call them \\"bad\\" and they certainly aren't enough to take away from the brilliance of the show's best songs. For me, those \\"lesser\\" tracks are \\"A Sentimental Man\\", \\"Wonderful\\", and \\"Thank Goodness\\".<br /><br />If you're a fan of Broadway, by all means pick this up. Even if you aren't, Wicked may just instigate a musical addiction for you. It's a great entry point as the music can be appreciated by theatre-lovers and theatre-novices alike. I've lent my CD to about half a dozen friends who've seen no more than one or two musicals in their lives, and all of them fell in love with it and bought copies of their own soon after.<br /><br />Check it out!!
B000002O1Q|5.0|Saturday Night Fever was a double, Grease was a double (albeit it was the 70's and double albums/soundtracks were aplenty).Also, those films were blockbusters which ,unfortunately, Streets of Fire was not (luke warm reviews , moderate ticket summer sales and so-so public viewing interest/acceptance at best). If BladeRunner from 1982, two years prior, had been a musical-sci-fi flick, Streets is what it would have been...Streets of Fire could have easily contained more tracks by other artists or the same ones. I have always felt that the soundtrack is so awesome but too short in length...After a year of hearing fantastic soundtracks like Flashdance and being bombarded by the break dance craze (Breakin', Beat Street, etc.), Streets of Fire offered something fresh (part retro and part future).     The music was phenomenal! It's one of my favorite soundtracks of all time due to it's great range of different styles and time periods of various genres that work incredibly well together(musical cohesiveness?). You have the Broadway-esque Steinem production of Nowhere Fast and Tonight Is What It Means To Be Young.The country pop-rock flavored ballad tune It'll Never Be You.The late Dan Hartman's sadly enough ONLY huge pop/R&B/Motown-like hit I Can Dream About You. The track Sorcerer by Marilyn Martin has Stevie Nicks' unmistakeable trademark style of lyrics and sound all over it since Nicks wrote the song---you can actually hear Nicks on background vocals, though she's not credited on the album (it has a bit of a Tom Petty edge).The Blasters and Ry Cooder also contribute some 50's sock hop rockin' tunes.A doo-wop number by Greg Phillinganes called Countdown To Love buddies up nicely with Hartman's I Can Dream About You.Aside from the smooth-crooning tracks you have The Fixx's rockin' futuristic sound of Deeper And Deeper. A previous reviewer mentioned that this track \\"feels out of place\\". It doesn't. Remember the film's time period is never clear (it's a \\"fable\\").It can be the past, the present, or future (even in a galaxy far, far...you get the picture)!When hearing the music in visual context with the film, it's as though (visually)it's Grease meets BladeRunner.There's a 50's futuristic/40's noirish atmospheric look and feel to the film itself...Streets of Fire (soundtrack) seems to have established itself over the years as more of a cult-status level as opposed to what other soundtracks had become in the sound track blockbuster arena of the 80's. It is 20 years and Streets of Fire has aged incredibly well with it's many styles and different range of music and talent ! If only MCA would re-release a re-mastered version containing more material that would include alternate takes, and possibly tunes that were meant for the film but ended up getting shelved---throw in some extended versions and re-mixes as well...    Another soundtrack that I will highly recommend is from the film Absolute Beginners(1986)---If you can get a hold of the import version on cd which contains 18 outstanding tracks by various artists (David Bowie, Sade, Style Council)the music contains everything from late 50's early 60's hip-swing,jazz-like infectious grooves!The American soundtrack version release only had 10 tracks and an alternate album/tape art cover;The European import contains many more tracks on one cd. A couple of tracks might have a contemporary sound but nevertheless it's an awesome cd to get a hold of (and rare, also)!...
0393035158|5.0|I read the review of this book in the New York Times Book Review and was very intrigued.  I'm now on page 80.  Don't listen to Publisher's Weekly or to the fanatics who have given this book 1 or 2 stars.  This is an incredibly serious and engaging book.  I haven't gotten to the part on torture yet (the only part the New York Times didn't like), but I can't recommend this book highly enough.
006019250X|5.0|I chose the illustrated alchemist over the paperback one. It certainly was a good choice. The story kept pounding the message over and over again, to follow your dreams; and never give up. Very inspirational, and true to what we all have to do if we want to achieve anything in life. Also, the beautiful illustrations kept me flipping the pages quickly. <br />I would recommend going on to other books by Paulo Coelho, which are just as easy to read, yet meaningful.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This has to be one of the slowest most boring movies I've ever had to suffer through.

B00005RFQ5|5.0|I admit that I purchase every Prince album in hopes of being reminded of past glory, the feeling that I felt in the 80's like Purple Rain and Sign of the Times, but as Prince grew, I didn't. I wanted him to remain the same, but just as my musical interests grew from pop to jazz, and from rap to r&b, I have to thank Prince for growing as well. <br /> <br />Previous reviews trash this album because it doesn't sound like the older ones, but why should it? How bored would be with Prince if he didn't continue to reinvent himself and create different types of music. <br /> <br />I thank Prince for continuing to challenge me to keep me growing in the same place. And for those who can't keep up, you have 25 years of history in your Prince cd collection to keep you...how many other artists have blessed us with so much material?  <br /> <br />So many artsits are afraid to do something different with thier music that is in thier heart and they end up doing the same type of music because of the industry and end up with two albums and no one is interested anymore.  <br /> <br />By the way, the musicianship is awesome... <br /> <br /> <br />

0060977493|1.0|I found this to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time, and I am an avid book reader.  I truly cannot comprehend how this nonsense could have won the Booker Prize.  The writing style is awful, at best and the main characters horrible, little children.  Someody once told me that the Booker Prize was all political and not necessarily based on the ability of the writer.  After reading this I believe it!  Really don't waste your time buying this.  I hope with the money she earned from this, politically active Ms Roy will take writing classes!

B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is probably Radiohead's most underrated album, and I personally find it superior to the more critically acclaimed Kid A, which I always thought was lacking an \\"edge.\\"   <br /> <br />Tinny drums and synths open up the album on \\"pack'd...\\", and Thom sings \\"I'm a reasonable man, get off my case...\\" repeatedly.  'Pyramid Song' is a haunting tune that truly mesmerizes, and 'You and Whose Army' is a sarcastic taunt that builds to an amazing crescendo.   <br /> <br />Radiohead is not afraid to experiment, and they do it wonderfully on this album.  Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors will likely get skipped on the first 100 listens of this album, but once it finally registers, you realize that it is just Radiohead being themselves (though I do think this song exists so Thom can say \\"and there are trap doors, that you can't come back from.\\")  Like Spinning Plates is another sonic experiment that is far more accessible than Pull/Pulk, and the crowning glory of the Album and the Kid A/Amnesiac sessions is \\"Life in a Glass House,\\" with its attempt at a big band sound, though with a serious dose of drunkeness thrown in.  Radiohead, of course, pulls it off perfectly.  <br /> <br />The middle of the album is occupied by their more standard fare 'I Might be Wrong,' 'Knives out,' and 'Morning Bell/Amnesiac.'  The first two are both great songs, though the inclusion of 'Morning Bell' on this album as well was disappointing--I didn't like it on Kid A, and it is the weakest point of this album as well.   <br /> <br />Overall, this album is great, though it is not for the unitiated listener.  And like much of Radiohead's work, it takes a few listens before it sinks in.
B00028HBL6|5.0|Although this is only a movie, it was a pretty good representation of our Savior's death on the Cross.

0671027387|3.0|This was the 3rd Dan Brown thriller that I read.  It was no Angels and Demons or DaVinci Code, which were awesome reads.  Really the only thing to keep me going in this one is Dan Brown's ability to leave you with a cliffhanger at the end of nearly every chapter.<br /><br />The topic of this book is smart and exciting, the way it was delivered was way over the top.<br /><br />Rachel is either the smartest or the luckiest person in the world.  It's amazing how many near death experiences she encounters only to live on to face her next obstacle.  She is also much smarter than the scientists as she solves many questions that they couldn't.<br /><br />Yeah, I know it's just a work of fiction and I like an action packed read as much as anyone, but there is a point when the author needs to realize enough is enough.<br /><br />I can't wait for Dan Brown's next novel, which is going to pick up where The DaVinci Code ended.  I think  Mr. Brown has found his niche with the arts/religion thrillers.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|I must admit, I'm a bit dismayed by all the terrible reviews of this film.  It especially angers me when I hear film critics refer to this film as \\"reviled by Trek fans and others alike.\\"  I have been, and continue to be, a Star Trek fan, and I consider ST 5 by far the best of the Star Trek films (including the Next Generation films).  The commonly beloved ST films, including ST 2 and the inane ST 4, suffered from cheekiness.  For some, that's alright, because all Star Trek ever was to them was an assortment of jokes and action scenes in space.  Star Trek V managed to elevate above space shootouts and wisecracks (although it had those too), and deliver a thought-provoking and satisfying philosophical journey.  Star Trek, at its best, dealt with difficult questions, with speculations about humankind, the future, and our place in the universe.  At it's worst, it resorted to jokes and immediate dangers, with plots that can be summed up with \\"oh no, how do we save ourselves and the world from getting destroyed!\\" or cheap laughs (Trouble with Tribbles, ST IV).  Star Trek V, although not a perfect film, gave us lasting questions--what is the nature of the divine, and how far will humans go to discover it?  Are we deceived by the very thought that there is such a thing?   <br />The characters are at their boldest and most exciting in ST V, with Kirk delivering classic performances, such as his insistance that he needs his pain, for it makes him what he is.  Before ST V, I didn't really even like Captain Kirk, but I after it, he became one of my favorites (almost as great as Jean-Luc Picard).  I suppose I'll never understand the shunning of this film by ST fans, who gobbled up some of the more nonsensical Trek projects.   <br />But, lest it go completely battered and bruised, let me defend once more this spectacular film.   <br />Please, film writers, don't claim that ST V is universally hated.   This is coming from a hardcore Trek fan: at least one of us thinks that ST V is the greatest of the Trek films.  I'm not embarrassed to admit it.
B00005JMJG|4.0|Eternal Sunshine is totally unconventional in every way, especially the way the story is told and that should be no surprise to anyone that is familiar with Charlie Kaufman's work. I absolutely loved the movie and found it to be heartbreaking and handled it's characters and their relationships in a way not seen in most movies. <br /> <br />What was surprising to me was the emotional impact of the movie. Eternal Sunshine reveals its characters through their flaws making them real and human. This is an honest love story. It doesn't stick in flat uninteresting, good looking teen actors, and have them go through the motions of a standard love story. Instead the movie reveals its love story in layers through moments, both good and bad, but important. <br /> <br />The performances by Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey are nothing short of brilliant. There is not one moment of Jim Carrey's comic shtick, so those fans wanting to see the Jim Carrey of Bruce Almighty, Ace Ventura or Liar Liar will be very disappointed. Kate Winslet was able to pull of a very tough role, and I couldn't imagine anyone else that could have pulled it off so convincingly.  <br /> <br />The way that the film handled its material was effective and interesting. The special effects employed here work within the story and give it a definitive and different look.  <br /> <br />I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone. Even if you don't like the movie you have to admit that you haven't seen anything like it before which puts it ahead of most of the junk that Hollywood releases.  <br /> <br />
0385659806|5.0|What a fantastic  book!  It was the most realistic look at autism that I have ever seen in a novel.  I cannot believe what amazing insight  Mark Haddon has.  The writing is simple and sounds exactly like a boy with Autism/Asperger's  would sound like.  It is a very easy read, since it is written in such a straightforward, literal voice.  Very enjoyable!
B000044U4B|5.0|This is a must have for any Metal or Metallica Fan Awesome Sound this is rock history just listen it blows you away
B00005JMUA|5.0|I really enjoyed vol 1 and this I may have liked even more.  Much thicker plot, more dialogue than action, but you need vol 1 to complete the film.  I haven't had more fun watching movies than Kill Bill (1&2) in a long time.  Good suspense, excellent plot, no billion dollar effects, no sci-fi, no melodramatic moping.  And David Carradine rocks.
B00000JCRH|5.0|Since I own Every Metallica CD known to man this takes the cake. Really Good Sound just like on the originial LP. Totally Awesome Must have for any fan
B000002HMH|5.0|I think this is a completely underrated masterpeice.  This album still has a little bit of everything that makes Metallica Metallica.  You get all the cool riffs, solos, lyrics, memorable songs, etc.  Plus you get some extra experimental stuff.  Is it just me, or do some of these riffs have a southern feel to them?  This album is jam packed with some of Metallica's greatest riffs.  Also, check out the solo in House Jack Built, Kirk is going through an awesome talk effect.  Hero Of The Day is one of my favorate Metallica songs of all time.  I think that anything after the Black album has a little more accessible feel to it when compared to earlier releases.  That doesn't mean that these aren't great songs.  I think this is an excellent five star album.
0060512806|5.0|Set both in WW2 and the modern day, it deals with three young code-breakers, a Marine, a Japanese soldier, and a priest (and their descendants). This delightful fiction springs from history, inserting its characters among real figures like Alan Turing and General Douglas MacArthur.<br /><br />The story begins with three young math students at Princeton before the war, one American, one British and one German; and from there follows the triumphs brought by codebreaking and the bizarre lengths the Allies went to hide the fact that they broke the Enigma and the Japanese codes. In the modern day, the story follows Avi and Randall, two bright geeks building a startup company whose product will be secure data storage- doesn't sound interesting, but Stephenson's satirical take on the modern tech world is sharp and accurate. He also takes shots at academics, puts one character through a P.G. Wodehouse-style farce on an unpronouncable British isle, and reminded me of Catch-22 with the hoops the heroic Marine, Bobby Shaftoe, has to go through.<br /><br />The writing may be tedious for some, as it jumps from character to character, but I found it quite humorous. It's a long read but worth the trip. If one storyline drags, you're quickly shifted to another one, and while you can predict how they will converge, it stays compelling.
B00001ODGR|5.0|Having seen many concerts live and on tape ,(boy I wish I was at this one!!!) I have to say this is one of the best. From the opening curtain to the close.  I was singing along and wished it was longer. Dennis Deyoung is a master showman with a beautiful God given voice,Tommy's acoustic guitar work will give you goosebumps as will his clear vocals and JY's guitar work and backup's are awesome and the drummer was great too. This is the real STYX Dennis,Tommy and JY. Buy this one and you'll have a great concert to see over and over and over again. MJB
0679745653|4.0|The first story \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is wonderful and worth the entire book! I dont need to go further, read the book- and you will know why Holly GoLightly is well known!
B000062YAZ|5.0|people like gregg dilmore and bernard thomas don't know hwat real music is. they think black sabbath and led zeppelin suck and they think metallica's st. anger is the best album ever. and benard thomas freakin wrote that avril lavigne is real punk music. he also likes new kids on the block, just read his reviews.    SLAYER RULES! SLAYER! SLAYER! SLAYER!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|i first heard of gavin degraw when one tree hill premiered on the wb.  that same night i looked up his website, heard more of his songs, and became a fan.  he is just so talented.  his cd is awsome and brilliant.  he is also extraordinary in concert.
0393035158|2.0|This book holds religion responsible for strife, terror and war. This is a highly simplistic view.  <br /> <br />The author cites many examples of hatred and bigotry attribited to religion. In this, he does not give a pass to any religion. All- Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and Muslim - are all taken to task for misbehaving from time to time. <br /> <br />Many scientists who are known for rationality and resoning have reconciled faith/religion and scientific reasoning. Scientific method and belief in God can be reconciled and are not mutually exclusive. <br /> <br />The book is very one sided beacuse it does not bother to state good things that have come out of various religions over the history of mankind. <br /> <br />All religions have good and bad people who act in the name of religion to do good and bad things.  <br /> <br />Religion is like a knife. It can hurt someone or help someone. It depends on how people to choose to use religious teachings which are generally noble principles. <br />
B000002UDB|5.0|This album is often referred to as a bunch of hit singles but I disagree. It starts with an intro song practically copying the Sgt. Pepper beginning. Instead of the album being a show, it's a tour or trip(Paul was on an acid trip when he got the idea for the album. Surprise, surprise.) The body is simply fantastic. Song after song is brilliant. \\"Hello, Goodbye\\", \\"Strawberry Fields, Forever,\\" \\"Penny Lane\\" etc. It's nicely concluded with the Beatles timeless, despite being in the hippie era, saying \\"All You Need is Love.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Blue Jay Way\\" and \\"Flying\\" are mediocre, not bad but mediocre. All the rest are five star songs. One of the few albums that can boast this for me. As good as Revolver or Pepper.
B00005221M|4.0|This film accomplishes what few have been able to do well... mesh a classical romance with a compelling story line.  Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe seem to be a perfect match of classical forbidden love.<br /><br />This film is beautiful to see with eye, enchanting to listen to with the ears and satisfying to grasp with the heart.  Michael Mann does a yeoman's job with James Fenimore Cooper's novel. In addition to raising the temperatures of the female viewers, Daniel Day-Lewis actually turns a credible effort in his portrayal of Hawkeye, an American settler raised by the Mohicans.<br /><br />Long time American Indian activist Russell Means is compelling as Chingachgook Hawkeye's adoptive Indian father. Wes Studi is chilling as the renegade leader Magua.<br /><br />The Last of the Mohicans is one of those movies you will want to purchase and watch from time to time as a reminder of honorable things to live for.
B000002UAR|5.0|Incredible. The instrumentation is impeccable as well as the songwriting throughout the whole album. It's hard to believe they went from having pretty much only drums, bass, acoustic, and electric guitars on every song just a few years before. Revolver has a new instrument on almost every track. Rarely does so much experimenting turn into a masterpiece such as Revolver. I wish this album was far more than 35 minutes.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I just got this CD yesterday for my 20th birthday and listened to it immediately and was blown away.  Every song on there is great.  The only thing from making this album immaculate is a duet with Travis Tritt on \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" (which they did on CMT Crossroads).
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I'm a man with simple tastes, and someone who knows what he likes.  But I do have some very definite and strong opinions.  So strong, in fact, that my friends have nicknames for me, like \\"Music Maestro\\", \\"Master of Music\\", \\"Music Master\\", and \\"He Who Always Seems to be Right in the Ways of Music\\".  They tease me and encourage me to enter the reviewing field, but I'm content to be an Amazon wizard! <br /> <br />I'm sure you're wondering why I went to that much trouble to explain myself - well, it's just to say that I know what I like, and I like the good stuff.  And when I'm looking for the best of the best, I turn to Phil. <br /> <br />Phil has been rocking my world for almost thirty years now, and I have to say I'm constantly surprised and challenged by what he's doing.  This hits collection shows the best of his best, and it's simply one \\"wow\\" track after another.  \\"Ssssudio\\"?  Perfection.  \\"One More Night\\"?  Could go on for 40 more nights, as far as I'm concerned.  \\"Two Hearts\\"?  A masterpiece.  \\"In the Air Tonight?\\"  I don't really care for this song. <br /> <br />All I have to say is if you like hard rock, this is the place to start.  You'll be hooked from the start, much like I am today.  I only wish the collection's compilers had seen fit to include \\"One Night In Bangkok\\", one of Phil's biggest hits.   <br /> <br />But why argue with perfection?
0679745653|4.0|Taking place in a New York City apartment building Truman Capote the author of Breakfast at Tiffany's places two characters in a very realistic setting. Holy Golightly is the attraction of the narrator who she comes to befriend and nickname \\"Fred\\". Holly and the narrator live in the same apartment building and begin to develop a strong relationship. It all starts when one night Holly knocks on the narrator's door to try to escape a man that is trying to bite her, which she has let in her room. After this point in the story the two characters, Holly and Fred begin to develop a relationship that teaches many valuable lessons both good and bad throughout the story.<br /><br /> Holly's conflict throughout the book deals with her relationship between men. Through this conflict the reader gets to experience the theme of the book by taking a look at the building of relationships. Almost every night Holly brings a new man home and almost instantly there seams to be a problem. Fred gets more information about Holly when on day her husband comes to get her back. Fred learns that she was married at the age of 14 and ran away. As the story progresses it is obvious that Holly Golightly likes the company of a male figure in her life, but also likes to be an independent woman, which would explain the relationship between her and Fred. She liked having him there but things always turned sour when she felt that Fred was getting too close.<br /><br /> It is obvious to see why Breakfast at Tiffany's is a classic. This book has been around for years and years and the story of Holly Golightly and Fred and the lessons learned are still relevant issues in society today.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I really enjoyed this tear-jerker.  I am not familiar with Aboriginal history and had no idea that what was portrayed in this true story actually took place in a so-called civilized nation.  I would advice all persons interested in history and how inhumane we can be to each other because of supposed racial superiority to watch this film.  Since there was no cursing or violence, children should be encouraged to watch with their parents. <br /> <br />This film deserves much more than 5 stars.
B00005JNEI|1.0|What a wonderful example of poorly made propaganda!  At least Leni Riefenstahl had the talent to make Triumph of the Will kind of Artsy Fartsy!  This mess is so obviously raked with falsehoods and 1/4 truths that it should be a terrible embarrassment to anyone with an IQ over 6.  But, I suppose if you yell it loud enough, long enough, and be outrageous enough, someone will believe it somewhere!  Not to mention the very important UFO enthusiasts and other pseudo-psychos running around!  Sad Michael, it's not a documentary, documentaries require a certain amount of historical reality.  This is a poorly done piece of propaganda only.  Hitler would have been very unhappy with the quality!
B00008EQRQ|5.0|This is an intriguing, unusual, beautifully directed, highly atmospheric film that successfully crosses any number of genre: film noir, thriller, mystery, and horror. The plot is simple. In the mid nineteen fifties, a mysterious and slightly sinister business man, Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro), hires Brooklyn gumshoe, Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), for a missing person case.  Angel's investigation, for which he is being paid a princely sum for the time, takes him from Harlem to New Orleans, as he looks for a former crooner named Johnny Favorite, who sometime during the early nineteen forties apparently welched on a business deal with Louis Cypher and hasn't been heard from since.<br /><br />What happens when Angel gets to New Orleans will be infused with voodoo rites, ritual murders and taboo sex. The Big Easy is hardly that for our erstwhile detective, as he becomes susceptible to a series of initially puzzling flashbacks. Moreover, it seems that everyone with whom he meets, who had a connection to our missing crooner, ends up being savagely murdered. When he meets with a tarot card reader (Charlotte Rampling), it is just the beginning of the end for our increasingly disheveled gumshoe. His introduction to the gorgeous Epiphany (Lisa Bonet), a seventeen year old voodoo queen, later leads to a coupling that is played with singularly wild abandon.  Both of these women have a  connection to our mysterious missing person, Johnny Favorite, who, it turns out, may have given the Devil a run for his money in the evil department.<br /><br />Robert De Niro is sensational in the highly stylized,  role of Louis Cypher. He imbues the role with just the right amount of sardonic humor and restrained menace so as to make the character memorable. De Niro leaves an indelible imprint on every scene in which he is in.  Mickey Rourke, who is in nearly every scene in this film, shows that he has the ability to carry a movie, as he is simply terrific as the private detective who is slowly unraveling. As the film progresses, the toll that the investigation is taking on the tormented Angel is evident on his face. Angst ridden, bleary eyed, and disheveled, Angel is definitely involved in the biggest case of his life. As he gets closer to the truth of what happened to Johnny Favorite, the more his life seems to be spinning out of control. Rourke manages to convey all this, no easy task. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent and adds to the flavor of this delicious gumbo of a film, which is reminiscent of Goethe's Faust. Undoubtedly, this film is one of  Alan Parker's best directorial efforts.  Bravo!unraveling.

B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore is a hero to me, and to many other college students who are already cynical about American politics. He is truly a patriot. I would not disagree with anyone who called this film propoganda, but it's incredibly high-quality, thought-provoking propoganda. Moore's objective is obviously to paint the most unflattering portrait of Bush possible. For example, by using numerous clips of Bush lounging at his ranch, sipping beer, always looking unpresidential. But Moore does shed light on the truth in many ways and continues to amaze his fans with his boldness and his willingness to explore the most unsettling aspects of our country.  <br />     Seeing Moore at the Republican National Convention made me so happy! This is proof that he Moore is a true journalist; he can get anywhere. He will do anything to expose the lies of the Republican party and to fight on behalf of average Americans. <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|This movie is just as good as the first and more slow and easy going than the first. More dialogue and has more depth. The ending was perfect...i even figured it out before by the middle of the movie. The old man in the movie is funny as hell! He's a mix of Yoda, Gandalf and the general in Heavy metal jacket. Damn hilarous scenes, and one gruesome scene with a lady with a patched eye. Great story...Great dialogue...wonderful cast..
B00006L7XQ|5.0|The last ten years or so of Cash's 50 year career were his best and his last album, The Man Comes Around, is the best of the best. Make sure you get the edition with the DVD of the \\"Hurt\\" video. It doesn't cost any more than the CD without the DVD.    Just about every song he did for the American label is awesome but this is the best album by far. If you don't own this album you're a loser.
B00005JMEW|5.0|It has the humor...the gore...the strange dialogue...and a great story by tarantino. i rented it and i thought, \\"Wow what a story!\\" Uma Therman deserves Best Actress at the Academy Awards! The sword fighting scenes are cool and gory as hell! YEA GORY! BLOOD! BLOODD! LIMBS BEING SLICED!!!HEADS CUT!! GUYS BEING BUTCHERED BY UMA IS GREAT!!!!!!! What and ending and i loved it!!!Watch it!!!!! Its worth buying!!!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|First off, I was a kid when Star Wars came out in 1977 and have loved all three movies ever since.  However, some people are so fanatical about them that any slight additions or improvements to them is sacrilege.  Folks, this is the best scifi fantasy film of all time, but it's still just a movie.  The best thing about these movies is the improved picture and sound.  I tried viewing my old VHS tapes and they looked terrible after watching the rerelease back in 1997.  The new scenes  between all three movies probably clocks in at under thirty minutes so it's not really messing with the pacing and feel.  Be a Star Wars fan not a fanatic purist.
B00000G3Q4|4.0|Okay for all mental patience out there who think all horror movies are suppose to be scary, well your wrong! I thought the movie did sound stupid at first but then i watched it and laughed so hard. I loved it and i think the movie was good being a low budget. Well The story is simple: A Bunch of teens in a cabin for the week and they encounter demons and people become posessed. This movie was just like what we thought was scary when we were kids, \\"Cabins, Woods, and in the middle of Nowhere!\\" Sam just like to be a kid! And so does all directors! AND THATS COOL!!!!!!
B0000DD7LC|2.0|I loved \\"Songs In A Minor\\"...though there were a few so-so songs, they were more than made-up for by some absolutely amazing songs filled with moving, wonderful moments... <br /> <br />While the \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" has no truly crappy music (I find all the songs enjoyable enough to listen to), there are none of the highs or beautiful moments from before...can't help but feel disappointed by this. It's very pop, more commercial, much less soulful, and the piano doesn't feature in the gorgeous way it did before. <br /> <br />It seems a lot like the Tracy Chapman Syndrome to me...first great album by a down-to-earth, struggling, for-real artist expressing raw emotion, desires and needs...followed by average second album by a well-off, comfortable person who no longer has much to say... <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001611DI|5.0|Gore...zombies...cops...swat teams....a mall...corpse...funny music...'What more can you ask from a cult horror film of the 70s?\\" If anyone is to think, \\"What a bad movie becuase zombies are silly and stupid\\" WELL THEY'RE WRONG! The movie is a cult movie and it has inspired many video game makers who made Resident EVIL!!! If you are to say it is a stupid movie, then you deserve to be a zombie! i love it when they blow one of the guy's heads to pieces..hehehehe
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Any Dream Theater fan should know from the following information that this is going to be an awesome release: <br /> <br />\\"This 2-DVD set features a concert taped on April 26, 2004, at the famed Budokan in Tokyo, Japan. Disc One is the complete live concert. Disc two is packed with special features including a Japanese tour documentary, guitar/keyboard/drum solos, the tour opening video and a multiangle version of \\"Instrumedley.\\"\\" <br /> <br />Also, the setlist: <br /> <br />    * As I am <br />    * This Dying Soul <br />    * Beyond This Life <br />    * Hollow Years <br />    * War Inside My Head <br />    * The Test that Stumped Them All <br />    * Endless Sacrifice <br />    * Instrumedly <br />    * Trial of Tears <br />    * New Millennium <br />    * Keyboard Solo <br />    * Only a Matter of Time <br />    * Goodnight Kiss <br />    * Solitary Shell <br />    * Stream of Conciousness <br />    * Disappear <br />    * Pull Me Under <br />    * In the Name of God <br /> <br />Which is also great. I obviously have not seen this yet, as it is only being released on October 5th, but this is going to be a must for any modern Dream Theater fan. A whole second disc of Bonus material is bound to be a lot of fun, too. Unfortunately, I don't believe there is any band commentary. Alas, I'm sure that is this 2DVD set's only downside.

1592400876|5.0|Even the hudreds of reviews have not done justice to this little Gem! Of those perused, only Stephen Haines of Canada did mostly  Justice! Of course he has super experience in reading one dozen books in August...writing more reviews than anyone else I know! Now if I can paraphrase his \\"Apostrophe Aberrations and Comma Confusions,\\" this runaway #I British Best Seller even overshoots it's goal of setting us all straight on Punctuation!   <br /> <br />\\"Veriy I say unto Thee this day, thou shalt be with me in Paradise.\\" (Promise of Purgatory?) \\"Comfort ye, or cheer-up you lot!\\"...\\"Now I must go and get on my Lover!\\"...The Convict said the Judge is MAD!\\"    <br /> <br />Thus and so, \\"The use of commas cannot be learned by rule!\\" The fun of commas is of course, the semantic havoc they can create when wrongly inserted... \\"What is this thing called, Love?\\" Or carelessly omitted, \\"He shot himself as a child.\\" Or the role of Duncan in MacBeth, who listened with pity & concern to accounts of wounded soldier in battle of Act I: \\"Go get him, surgeons.\\"  Rather than: \\"Go, get him surgeons.\\"  <br /> <br />My Profit and Fun as a Writer was from varied timing of commas, semi-colons, colons, and full-stops. Of course, I was unfamiliar with the term, Upside-down comma as an apostrophe! I remembered the patient professors who so leniently graded my papers, tests, dissertations, reflections and verbatim.  May God bless us all!
0393035158|5.0|It is a measure of a good book that it generates so much controversy.  I suppose it is also the measure of a good book that its detractors are generally imbeciles.  To read the negative reviews of The End of Faith is to see its thesis confirmed, over and over again.  You have the relgious nuts who can't deal with Harris' argument at all; you have the athiest nuts who can't deal with his very reasonable endorsement of spiritual experience; and then you just have the people who can't read, who raise challenges which Harris deals with very effectively in his book.  If there is fault to find with The End of Faith, it is probably that Harris has given his readers too much credit.  There is too little hand-holding and too much truth.
1400032717|5.0|This is a touching story of an emotionally immature boy named christopher, who tries to reason everything in life including the relationship with his father. <br /> one excerpt that best describes this is \\"I never tell lies. Mother says because i am a good person. But, that is not true. Because, at any given time and a given place, only one event can happen. But, if you start thinking about things that didn't happen, there are infinite possibilities.\\"  <br /> <br /> One side of him is, he is very good at maths, science, reasoning and general knowledge and has a very good memory of things.  <br /> Other side is, he has many behavioral problems dealing with people. some of them are like, <br />  1. sometimes he don't talk to people for several days <br />  2. he don't like people touching or hugging him including his own father and mother. He will scream or will hit, if somebody tries to touch him <br />  3. he don't like being in crowds <br />  4. sometimes he don't recognize when people are angry with him <br /> <br /> One of his favorite dreams is, \\"most of the people in the world are dead somehow.

0321200683|5.0|This is the third pattern book in my collection (the other two are Analysis Patterns by Martin Fowler and the definitive Design Patterns by the Gang of Four) and IMHO this is the best example yet of where patterns can really improve the development process. This is the first book I've seen to address the area of enterprise development where the real heavy lifting takes place. Applications don't miraculously integrate with one another; it takes talented, knowledgeable IT personnel to wire everything together. If you're one of those people, Enterprise Integration Patterns is an important addition to your toolkit. <br /> <br />Chapter 2 takes the reader through the integration efforts of a fictional enterprise to demonstrate some of the patterns in action. The descriptions of the problems and their possible solutions... just make sense. You can really see the benefit that these patterns provide to simplifying, organizing and clarifying the situation.
B0002DB52M|5.0|I will open my review of 'Dogville' with a quote from play writer and director Bertolt Brecht:    \\"Estrangement (verfremdung) means to historicize, that is, consider people and incidents as historically conditioned and transitory... The spectator will no longer see the characters on stage as unalterable, uninfluencable, helplessly delivered over to their fate. He will see that his man is such and such, because circumstances are such. And circumstances are such, because man is such. But he in turn is conceivable not only as he is now, but also as he might be-- that is, otherwise-- and the same holds true for circumstances. Hence, the spectator obtains a new attitude in the theatre... He will be received in the theatre as the great 'transformer,' who can intervene in the natural processes and the social processes, and who no longer accepts the world but masters it.\\"    Director Lars von Trier's masterful, however incendiary human drama is reflective of Brecht's theory of verfremdung, or estrangement. Many have complained not only of its striking parallels to the United States of America, but also of its lack of upfront emotion, emphasized by John Hurt's perfect narration. But it is meant to be this way, since von Trier barrows from Brecht's theory, and I think it not only strengthens the film's emotional involvement, but also cancels out any complaints of some sort of lowly attack on Americans, because it becomes far more universal.    Even the subtitle is eerily personal: \\"In a town not far from here...\\" I believe this is meant to establish that the town in the film may be set in Colorado, but is really meant to be psychologically placed by the viewer to wherever he or she feels it is applicable (hence Brecht's theory, once again, since it leaves the connection and action to the viewer who may alter his or her perception of the characters, setting and situation to however he or she wants). The film is also divided up into nine segments beginning with a prologue, eachcomplete in its own right.    What is incredible is that this reflection of \\"verfremdung\\" extends through every aspect the film, from its writing, to its performances, and most importantly to its sets. They are sparse, contrasting with von Trier's earlier films, leaving the walls off of the houses, the dogs off of the streets, and resorting items like these to mere chalk marks so that we may fill in the details as the story unfolds in our minds.    Essentially, the story of 'Dogville' concerns a woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who is running from the mob for reasons unknown to the citizens of Dogville, Colorado. They agree to keep her as a result of Tom Edison, Jr.'s (Paul Bettany) persuasion. Progressively, Grace's trust is gained and then lost, despite her efforts, and as the police swing by again and again, they then chain her to a large rusted piece of metal and she is prostituted by the men of the town, all the while working through the day for the villagers, who are frightened, projecting this fear through vilifying Grace's very humanity. This all ends chaotically, and we are meant to decide for ourselves what this film means, how and if it applies to us, what von Trier's objectives were, and finally, how we should react.    This explains why there is such a divide among critics and viewers. It is so easily crafted to your own psyche that your view will immediately reflect your opinions of the current state of this world, which the film is so obviously about in addition to human goodness, only further explaining why so many believe it is a direct attack on Americans only, though it is far more than just that (however, I never said that wasn't a part of its message).    The performances are virtuoso in that they flawlessly comply with the combination of Brecht's theory and von Trier's emotional rawness. They are at times real and toned down, so that we can also absorb them into our minds and complete them ourselves.    The standout is Nicole Kidman, who should receive an Acadamy Award nomination for her work, but probably won't considering how challenging 'Dogville' is as a whole, and the fact that it was released so early in the year. You feel for her interpretation of Grace, even though she is held at such a distance. Her eyes allow us to travel into her mind and assimilate her pains and her desire to somehow requite the misery her company has so willingly inflicted upon her. I began to feel the horror, as well as the towns malignancy within her inner being. It is probably Kidman's best performance to date. She has always been able to bring nuance to a wide variety of vulnerable characters, and this is when I've seen her give the most complete version of that particular persona.    Also notable were Paul Bettany and Patricia Clarkson, who both add an astounding array of dimensions to two characters who have more prominence in the film than the rest of the supporting cast. They allow us to understand them, as well, no matter their actions.    Ultimately, von Trier has achieved his goal with 'Dogville.' It is his strongest work to date, and has left me contemplating whether or not it is a masterpiece, because it is one of the few films in recent years that attempts to capitalize and reflect the fears, needs and opinions of our time. Further more, it is a most visionary piece, not only visually but emotionally. It allows us to discuss and think about it for weeks, and offers interesting insight into a European view of our world. Though I feel most may immediately reject the film as sick propaganda, take the time to consider the layers von Trier has so masterfully embedded into it. If you do so, I can't guarantee you will still admire the film, but you will have gained much more out of it. In fact, I think it may be impossible to avoid its visceral qualities. In other words, give it a chance. It is all about who you are. Referring back to Brecht's theory, you are allowed to influence and alter, making this film your own.
6305903182|3.0|This is the \\"Final Cut\\" the final movie in the trilogy. Though not as good as the second in my opinion, its by far better than the first. There are only three things that hold this movie back from being a A+ movie, #1 film editing, though the film looked great in some areas it lost all its lushure. #2 better soundtrack, all the music in the movie is purely forgettable. #3 better acting, Neve Campbel, Dave Arcwet, and Cortiny Cox, are the only good actors in the movie every one else needs to find a new perfeshon than being an actor. <br />These here are the reasons that this movie is not a A+, movie these are not the reasons not to watch it. Because watch it its a good popcorn movie that many will enjoy, seris fans may not like the ending but they will enjoy the overall \\"Final Cut\\" of the Scream Trilogy.
B0002DB50E|5.0|Because it's on and is certainly more entertaining than The Beachcombers, Magnum P.E.I. or any other Canadian television programming circa 1982. Riding on the wave of his previous box-office success, Videodrome (1982) marks the first time that Cronenberg creates a story revolving around a single character. Like Donleavy's Singular Man (1964), introduction to conflict appears in the first person, point of view narrative acting as the catalyst within which Max Renn (James Woods) is to exist. There is a distinct break between what is supposed to be reality and that of hallucination (revisited later in Naked Lunch [1991]), the point to which is open for debate, a trajectory to which the film never resurfaces from. Certainly, the audience sees what Woods perceives, first person.<br />  Establishing Max Renn as head of Channel 83, the opportunist runs a Toronto-based television station geared at projecting the sensational. After picking up a renegade channel from the otherness of the third world, Max becomes the product of McLuhanesque experimentation, pulses from television signals controlling his thought processes and subsequent actions. The character of Max Renn, it is said, was modeled on Moses Znaimer, head of CITY TV, Toronto's equivalent to Channel 83: Brian Oblivion's monologues a la Speakers Corner.<br />  Our hero's artillery consists of a phallic-like extension housed in a vaginal opening. Nikki Brand (Deborah Harry) represents the desirable introduction to a product that he himself markets, perhaps an obviation that until this point was unattainable? Max's transgressive tendencies are projected through the videodrome, liberating him from the stigmatic purveyor of physical explicitness. <br />  In a sense, Cronenberg has created his notion of Videodrome both as way of weeding out and destroying cells aroused by such activity, and as a way of gauging public sentiment toward this subject matter. The film itself was exposed to the judgmental ardor: its text encompassed, picketed by female members of parliament and removed from public screening, the subtext of subtext. Cut into three versions, the television cut is laughable; the VHS version appears as mise en scène in Atom Egoyan's Speaking Parts (1989), and the old DVD contains an original theatrical trailer that is a fitting pre-curser to this masterpiece.    <br />The Criterion Collections DVD has the following extra features:<br />-Two audio commentaries: David Cronenberg and director of photography Mark Irwin, and actors James Woods and Deborah Harry <br />-Camera (2000), a short film starring Videodromes Les Carlson, written and directed by Cronenberg <br />-Forging the New Flesh, a new half-hour documentary featurette by filmmaker Michael Lennick about the creation of Videodromes video and prosthetic makeup effects <br />-Effects Men, a new audio interview with special makeup effects creator Baker and video effects supervisor Lennick <br />-Bootleg Video: the complete footage of Samurai Dreams and seven minutes of transmissions from Videodrome, presented in their original, unedited form with filmmaker commentary <br />-Fear on Film, a 26-minute roundtable discussion from 1982 between filmmakers Cronenberg, John Carpenter, John Landis, and Mick Garris <br />-Original theatrical trailers and promotional featurette <br />-Stills galleries featuring hundreds of rare behind-the-scenes production photos, special effects makeup tests, and publicity photos English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired <br />-Optimal image quality: RSDL dual-layer edition
B00005JNEI|1.0|I urge people to read this review on the movie, Farenheit 9/11. [...] -- titled the lies of Michael Moore. This was a MSN.com article (obviously). <br /> <br />Bush has over a 55% approval rating in the country for a reason -- he is a great commander-in-chief in my opinion. The way Moore depicts Iraq as nothing but peaceful to the world and it's citizens truly does sicken me. <br /> <br />The way he also says the election would've been won if recounted again no matter what for Gore in the beginning of the movie was completely false... along with how he accuses of Bush going to war just to please his former business associates. <br /> <br />55% of the American people trust Bush and approve of what he's done, and I'm one of them. I saw this movie on opening weekend -- and it is simply false. The only good documentary Michael Moore ever did was Roger & Me... other than that he seems to like to lie a lot to promote his socialist agenda.
B00005K3NY|5.0|The notion of the money shot is malleable. Scanners (1980) includes one that actually works to demarcate subtext. Here, the mind actually leaves the body, violently. Scanners' ...transitional edits serve as direct, amplifying links where the last moment of the first scene builds a question or expectation that is immediately answered or fulfilled in the next shot  Filmplan International financed the production, budgeting more than $4 million toward the project. Originally called The Sensitives and then Telepathy 2000, Scanners had been in revision since the early 1970s, trumped by the personal vigor behind both Fast Company and The Brood. Like Crimes of the Future, Cronenberg institutionalizes the Cartesian, Consec housing the balance. The opening sequence, whereby a Scanner is hunted down, is guerilla filmmaking urban mall style, and is a reprise of Michael Anderson's Logan's Run (1976). The final shootout sequence whereby Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside) and Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) scan themselves to death happens to be the first film since Crimes of the Future to have a distinct notion of closure, the means to an end, culminating with an optimistic destruction of a character. Scanners is an attempt to make thought visible, the ramifications of which are stronger than the external. Our money shot, a proverbial augmentation: mind out of matter. Subsequence solidified Scanners as Cronenberg's first film to top the Variety box-office chart.
0393035158|5.0|As America slouches toward theocracy, Harris's book powerfully demonstrates on virtually every page Voltaire's \\"the truths of religion are never so well understood as by those who have lost the power of reasoning.\\" Which is to say that religion, at least mainstream Western, confounds Isaiah's \\"Come now and let us reason together.\\" Talk about ironies! <br />     \\"A man without reason,\\" the proverb teaches,\\"is a beast in season.\\" A beast, because without reason ignorance, passion, and prejudice rule. The same applies to a nation, examples of which we're quick to spot abroad, where we see, as in the light of day, the beastliness of governance by religion's unholy trinity of ignorance, passion, and prejudice. At home is another matter. Here we're like Plato's cave dwellers, confusing opinion with truth;stubbornly refusing to analyze cherished beliefs; literally preferring to die(or kill someone) than examine our religious assumptions.  <br />     Regarding religion, Harris, in short, effectively challenges our commitment to Socrates's famous aphorism: \\"The unexamined life is not worth living.\\" Religion says it is. We can't have it both ways. Which will it be? That question deserves a public airing in this presidential season. It won't get it, of couse, for a reason uttered by another immortal sage, Pogo:  \\"We has met the enemy, and it is us.\\" Those with any lingering doubts need to read this book. <br /> <br />      <br />      <br /> <br />       <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|3.0|Sure Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ is probobly the best movie of the year. But,the Dvd is the worst because it is so wrong if you have a very good movie but no special features
0792164903|4.0|\\"Sleepy Hollow\\" is fun.  Tim Burton outdid himself on this one.  I've always enjoyed Burton's work, but I felt that he might have gone a little overboard with the second \\"Batman\\" flick.  In the case of the Headless Horseman, though, the liberties taken make the story that much more captivating.  As usual, Burton crams as much atmosphere as he can into this film.  You actually feel like you've been transported to the creepiest part of 1799.  Johnny Depp is perfectly cast as Ichabod Crane.  He's a chicken, yet a brilliant mind lies under that facade.  Christina Ricci, as Katrina Van Tassel, is also perfectly cast, since she combines beauty, brains, and \\"goth\\" all into one.  Miranda Richardson is another standout as Katrina's wicked stepmother.  Jeffrey Jones, underrated since the dawn of time, has a smaller role in this flick, but his acting skills make his character shine.<br /><br />The special effects were excellent.  Christopher Walken, though all of his lines were grunts, grumbles, and one whispery, \\"Shhh!\\" was an excellent choice for the Horseman.  He was a walking, riding, head-whacking special effect all on his own.<br /><br />The story was great.  As stated before, Burton did take a few liberties with the story, but they made the film that much better.<br /><br />If you're looking for a little Halloween fun, or just want to get a little spooked any time of year, watch \\"Sleepy Hollow.\\"  It has just enough scares in it to mess with the younger kids(though anyone under thirteen should probably steer clear of this one), just enough fight sequences for the action fan, and great acting coupled with a plotline that'll keep even the toughest critic at attention.
B00007ELEL|5.0|This is my favorite Coen brothers film ever.  In fact, it may be the best comedy I've ever seen.  I have rented this movie some 20 or more times and finally bought it.  If you're looking for a movie to make you laugh like never before, watch this film!!  However, if rough language offends your delicate ears then don't see this.   <br />The Dude definitely abides!!
B0000024JN|5.0|Whether you're listening to this CD in year 1986, 2004, or 2104, this CD is always extremely enjoyable.  This album, along with \\"Raising Hell\\" are the albums that literally made hip-hop what it is today.  Three MCs - Adrock, MCA, and Mike D were just there to have fun and make great music while doing so, exchanging hilarious and sometimes ridiculous rhymes between the three of them.  Rick Rubin, the genius producer behind the album, used a variety of samples, along with some blaring guitar riffs to make songs such as the classic, \\"Fight For Your Right (To Party)\\" which has held up very well over time.<br /><br />The Beasties drop some great storytelling rhymes on \\"She's Crafty\\" and \\"Paul Revere\\" and some ridiculous and funny rhymes on \\"Girls\\" and \\"Brass Monkey.\\"  Forty-four and a half minutes of timeless rhymes.  This should be in any rap/hip-hop fan's collection, and anyone who enjoyed this should check out any of the other Beastie Boys albums.  It was \\"The New Style\\" back in '86, and it still has style in 2004.
B0001WTUH6|4.0|I've overlooked Underworld for awhile, mainly because I thought it was gonna be yet another Matrix and/or Blade redux. But I recently viewed the \\"unrated extended cut\\", and I gotta admit...all nitpicking aside, it drew me in & grabbed my attention. For 2+ hours, I bought into the idea of the \\"Underworld\\". I didn't get Shakespeare, nor was I expecting it...I enjoyed it for what it was, and I'll definitely be checking it out again (as well as the Underworld sequel, whenever it's released).     Even if our opinions differ about the storyline, acting, etc., I'd still recommend checking this version out just for the visuals alone. The storyline IS kinda foggy, but it kinda reminded me of waking up from a visually intense dream & struggling to grasp what exactly it was about. When basking in the surreal visuals of Underworld, maybe a little ambiguity in the storyline is necessary for the whole idea to work. And if you're still on the fence, I have four words for you: Kate Beckinsale in leather. If THAT doesn't entice you to check out Underworld, then God bless ya...
B00003CXCT|1.0|I remember the first time I watched the special edtition star wars movies. I didn't really see anything that made them better. Then I got to the return of the jedi. When that fuzzball thing started singing and dancing across the screen, I wanted to throw up. If George Lucas wants to turn the original star wars trilogy into musicals for children I have no problem with that. He created the movies, he has every right to do so. But for him to say, I'm ruining the star wars movies, and I'm going to force everyone to watch these abominations, is outrageous. This basically means he made it so everyone who doesn't enjoy watching pure crap, won't every buy his movies again. It's sad but, whatever, I'm sure there will be plenty of science fiction movies out there that aren't directed towards 5 year olds. I would suggest looking into those instead of this mockery of a good trilogy.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Finally a new album of my hero of modern music times. A Valid Path is a brilliant album. Not everybody will probably like it, but I do. You will find some songs on the album, that are more or less in the old Alan Parsons Project style. One of them is 'We Play The Game' (featuring The Crystal Method; lead vocal: Alan Parsons himself). This should be the single in my opinion. I think it is a much better song than 'More Lost Without You': also good, but not special. Furthermore it is great to hear David Pack back on one of the best songs of the album 'You Can Run'.  <br />Furtermore the album contains 3 make overs of earlier songs: 'Return To Tungaska', with David Gilmour on guitar, is a make over of 'Antarctica' (of the Out Of Order-soundtrack); 'Mammagamma' (of the Eye In The Sky Album) is restyled; 'A Recurring Dream Within A Dream' (of the magical Tales Of Mystery And Imagination) is a modern composite of two works 'A Dream Within A Dream' and 'The Raven'. Alan Parsons has also written with many others great instrumentals such as 'L'Arc en Ciel' and 'Chomolunga'.  <br />Even if you do not recognize the Parsons or APP sounds immediately, try to listen to it several times and then you will come to the conclusion, that it is still the fascinating composer and producer, Alan Parsons. The only difference is, he has now composed and produced music of the 21st century. Hopefully a 5.1 surround sound version will be released as soon as possible! Then I will like the album even more...
B0002I831S|4.0|I give this collection only 4 stars because the same issues seem to be on every Star Trek seasonal release on DVD -- Next Generation, Deep Space Nine.  I want Paramount to fix the following for future releases: <br /> <br />1) Each disk should have the option to play all episodes, uninterrupted by clumsy interfaces. <br /> <br />2) The second chapter on the disk should begin just after the ending of the opening credits.  I'm sick of hearing the opening, and even more sick of skipping it to find myself deep into the episode, forced to rewind to the beginning.  I want to be able to sit down and enjoy the show, not manually fast forward through redundant opening credits. <br /> <br />I love the content of the DVD's; I just hate the interface/chapter placement.
B00004VVNB|3.0|As I recall, this film won an Oscar for its Special Effects (I could be wrong about this).  Yet the effects today seem rather amateurish, making extensive use of miniatures that don't come close to looking realistic.  <br /> <br />The story concept is interesting but not unique--an original series Star Trek episode called \\"For The World Is Hollow And I Have Touched The Sky\\" employs a similar plot device.  It also has elements of another original series Star Trek episode entitled, \\"Return of the Archons.\\" <br /> <br />The story is very simplistic...members of a post-apocolyptic society, unbeknownst to them, live out their lives beneath a dome where no one is permitted to live beyond the age of 30.  Those who chose to avoid \\"renewal\\" (a lavish state-sponsored murder rite) and flee are given the title of \\"runner.\\"  Enter Logan 5, played by Michael York, a \\"Sandman\\" whose sole responsibility it is to terminate \\"runners.\\"  In an effort to infiltrate the sect that harbors and aids runners, Logan 5 assumes the role of runner himself.  He is assisted by Jessica 6 (nobody seems to have a surname in the movie), played by the lovely--and very young--Jenny Agutter.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately for Logan, none of the other Sandmen have been informed of his covert mission--making him real-world target for elimination.  Their flight from termination leads them to a new world, a world outside the dome.  Their awed reaction to the first thing they see, the sun...  Jessica:  \\"What is it?\\"   Logan:  \\"I don't know, but it's warm.\\" ...is almost inspiring.  They eventually learn the truth about everything that has been going on and eventually try to set things right, even if it means destroying the society that so many of their fellow citizens have come to totally depend upon. <br /> <br />The movie is also noteworthy for a few other portrayals:  Farrah-Fawcett, in her first movie role, as a beautician (what else!), of sorts; Roscoe Lee Browne, in a rather humorous portrayal of a demented, murderous Tin Man straight out of the Wizard of Oz (I love that aluminum foil costume!); and, believe it or not, Oscas-winning actor Peter Ustinov, as an old hermit living in an abandoned Washington D.C. with his legion of cats. <br /> <br />An enjoyable time killer for a rainy day but nothing more.
B00000DQSV|4.0|This isn't an album that grabbed me immediately upon original release. In fact I wrote it off in whole because I couldn't stand the opening title track. While I have warmed to it somewhat, the lyrics still grate ( \\"don't monkey with my business\\" in particular is cringe inducing ). The few tracks I did like ( \\"American Science\\" \\"Skin Trade\\" and \\"Winter Marches On\\" ) didn't make up for the remainder, what I saw as studied and quite clumsy attempts at white funk. But time has been kind to \\"Notorious.\\" As a long time DD fan I now see it as the Chic/Sex Pistols hybrid they themselves said they set out to create when they first formed. No mistake, this is miles away from the dance/pop sound of their first three albums. It is produced and engineered to sound nothing at all like them. The drums are quite loud and brass arrangements feature prominately on most all the cuts. The guitars are also cranked up higher than ever - power chords galore being the obvious influence of the Power Station album the Taylors made the year before. \\"Skin Trade\\" still thrills. The chorus is a grabber, and its failure on the pop charts is still a bewilderment to me - I think it's one of their finest moments. \\"Vertigo\\" is sly and slinky, and quite groovy for a mid-tempo cut. \\"Hold Me\\" has one of those choruses that can only be called \\"soaring\\" and it's a very passionate performance - another highlight. The only song I don't care for is \\"So Misled\\" - it just doesn't get me there - but it is redeamed by the three closing cuts. Honestly, for years, I slagged this album off. But after dusting it off and giving it a listen with fresh ears, I find it more mature and more accomplished than \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" in particular, which was a terribly disappointing follow-up to the grand \\"Rio.\\"  Ignore the fact that this album wasn't commercially as big as earlier efforts ( Duran mania was by 1987 a distant memory for most people ) and let it stand on its own merit.
B00005QCVY|4.0|Ok...obviously there are stereotypes from the 1950s- male/female...that still exist today! (the all-American family) :\  But I liked it overall. I found myself laughing a lot...and there was one really romantic scene. I recommend it!
B00005M1CO|4.0|Elvenking takes some of the best things from folk metal and some of the best things from power metal and combines it into an eclectic masterpiece of epic proportions. The album starts off very folky and then gets into a serious power metal song with typical folk metal themes. The occasional fiddle graces us with her delightful visits in many of the songs, giving the listener a very folky feel, but one very different from the violin used by Rhapsody to create classical sounds. The band members' Italian accents are not heard at all making it very different from bands like Hammerfall who don't really try to hide their Scandinavian accents. Midway through the album the mood changes a little bit with some intense growling but soon becomes subdues and the happy folk/power metal continues. <br />The only real qualm that I have with this album is that it becomes somewhat monotonous as oh so many metal albums do. However even though most of the songs sound the same, it doesn't mean that they don't sound good: really good. If you like metal, elves, or fiddles I suggest you press the buy it now button.

This song is very romantic. I love every song on this CD. I would recommend it to anyone. Their music is so meaningfull. The lyrics to every song are great. Coldplay is awesome. If you love music that is meaningfull, touching, and beautiful then buy this album.
B000286RKW|5.0|Martin Scorsese's masterpiece Goodfellas has finally arrived on Special Edition DVD and boy is it about time.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a simple enough story to follow. Henry Hil(Liotta) has always wanted to be a gangster. He has since he can ever remember and he gets his start at a young age.<br /><br />Henry starts as a teenager doing erands for all the local wise guys. He works for Pauly(Sorvino) who is the bigshot of the guys in town. He likes Henry and loves that the kid loves his work. Also in the business are the smooth Jimmy Conway(De Niro) and the ruthless Tommy DeVito(Pesci) who go along with Henry on this lifelong journey through the mob.<br /><br />We get to see the highs of Henry like when he marries Karen(Bracco) and starts his family. To the lows of the late 1970's where he finally gets busted big for his involement in drugs.<br /><br />This movie is incredible. Like Coppola did with The Godfather Scorsese pays attention to all the details in this movie. The cast is absolutely flawless. The script is perfect. The sets are all real and authenic as are the costumes. This movie is just incredible.<br /><br />Ray Liotta gives the performance of his carear. He was a perfect cast for Henry Hill. He plays the tragic character to perfection from his happy high points to his cocaine filled sad points. Liotta not getting at least a nomination by the academy for this role is a shame.<br /><br />Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro are awesome in their supporting roles. Pesci won the Oscar for his role as Tommy Devito. He cracked me up in this movie playing the stero typical ultra violent wise guy. It really shows his depth and talent as an actor that he go do a character like Tommy and follow it up with a more family friendly charcter Harry in Home Alone.<br /><br />De Niro does his thing as Jimmy Conway. This guy is great with any charcter that he plays, but when he gets to be a violent mobster that just adds an exclamation point to it. I love his smooth talking and Jimmy is believable. Lorraine Bracco is also good as Karen and she did receive a best actress nomination for the role. All the performances are great in Goodfellas and props should go to everybody. This is one of the few movies that I've seen that has a perfect cast from the stars to extras.<br /><br />This is Martin Scorese's best movie. Like Coppola was born to do The Godfather and Spielberg was born to do Schindlers List this is Scorses's film. Nobody else could have pulled this off. The music the details it's all here. He should have gotten the Oscar for Best Director. Maybe he will finally get one for THe Aviator which is due later this year.<br /><br />You have to own Goodfellas. The DVD specials with documentaries are great. I loved the commentary from Scorese and Henry Hill. No serious DVD collection or movie collection is complete without this. Deep down inside like Hill I think we've all wanted to be gangsters at one point. I'll never be one, but I can experience the mob everytime I watch this. Go get Goodfellas now. You wont regret it.talking and Jimmy is believable. Lorraine Bracco is also good as Karen and she did receive a best actress nomination for the role.

B000006TRV|5.0|Pink Floyd is one of the greatest bands in the world. This relaxing album will allow you to think clearly. Although the music is different from mainstream music today, people must pay attention to the classic music that lead musicians to what they are today. In my opinion, all classic music was better, especially in the area of Rock.  I mean, The Who, Led Zepplin, Peter Frampton, Van Halen, Rush, Motley Crue, Iron Maiden. Listen to there music and you'll hear talent.  Nowadays music is just power chordes and yelling lyrics.  <br /> <br />     All i'm getting across is that the past is to be appreciated and especially a unique band like Pink Floyd. I recommend this album to anyone with the knowledge of good music. I am 14 years old and have sometimes more knowledge of rock bands that 50 year old guys.
B000000WG4|5.0|The fact is, I'm not really rating the record, but the music itself. The record is, to say, crude. Okay, agree or not, it REALLY sounds crude at times. Read the bio of Mike Oldfield and you will understand that Mike, at the time of recording TB, had unprofessional studio equipment, and was still lacking experience as a professional. But the music that he had made up is really a timeless masterpiece. The 1973 record, even remastered, TODAY doesn't really allow you to appreciate it. Take the Exposed Tubular Bells for instance. (live) It really blows me away. The Orchestral Tubular Bells are really enjoyable, and the recent remake (re-recording) the Tubular Bells 2003 is what I've been looking for. It's like Beethoven's symphony played by a more qualified orchestra. It makes the difference. Although, I enjoy listening to the original record because of the feeling it gives you. A huge part of history of classical rock music, that had frenzied half of the world at that time and made a quiet boy a star.  <br />If you are a stereo geek, or are very paranoid about quality, don't buy this record. Buy Tubular Bells 2003.
0061015725|3.0|The book has some interesting details. Everytime the lead character Jack is about to have an insight to save the day or the minute!, Mr. Crichton tells us some thing interesting about Warrior Ants or Serengeti Lions or some symbiotic relationship between ants and aphids or even about the cholera virus. <br /> <br />Notwithstanding Mr. Crichton's caveat in the prologue that technology can mature more quickly than we can predict with unexpected or disastrous consequences, I still felt some of the \\"evolutionary\\" advances of the \\"swarms of nano particles\\" are too over the top. Only because I have invested time to finish about 300 pages (of the 500 pages - paperback edition), I continued to read forward.Also, the ending is pretty mundane. <br /> <br />Not a good thing to happen to a guy like me who is trying to get back into a habit of reading novels/books instead of watching movie versions. <br /> <br />Ofcourse, Mr. Crichton is definitely one of the best authors out there. So, hopefully his next one is better. Personally, I thought it's pretty impressive he can go into a great deal of technical detail whether it's actually technical or fictitiously \\"technical\\". <br /> <br />It'd be much better to watch this on video (if there is going to be a movie version). Atleast it won't be as demanding as reading 500 pages, esp. in the eventual case that you don't like it very much.
0786852550|1.0|After having read a vast array of fantasy, ranging from masterworks like George R. R. Martin's saga \\"A song of fire and ice\\" to the classic R.A. Salvatore \\"Drizzt\\" dribble, and having enjoyed it all in its own way, I must say this book is completely lacking.  Stacked on a shelf next to most other fantasy books that I have encountered, it would definitely be in the company of its betters.  In fact, the only writing that I've enjoyed LESS than this is the work of David Eddings, which is repulsive in the extreme, simply for his poor writing ability (story notwithstanding). <br /> <br />WHY was it so bad? <br /> <br />The characterization, for one, left me completely nonplussed.  The story (the \\"action\\" as it were) starts off immediately, which is fine, but the author completely fails to make me care about his characters at all.  The boy Nathaniel feels like a stranger, I do not know him well enough to sympathize with his plight, and so am left uncaring about his quest for vengeance.  the sophmoric djinni that he summons is certainly amusing for a chapter or two, but over exaggerated boasting can only be considered funny to a point.  Over all I'd say I was thoroughly non-plussed with the two main characters.  Additionally, the way the author switches points of view is ridiculous.  If the book had been written from the point of view of the demon, that would be one thing.  Had it been third person, it would have been another.  The fact that it switches between third person and first person depending on which character the author is following, makes this reviewer feel aggitated and annoyed.  Christopher is so annoyed in fact that he may not read the last five pages of this book.  He may simply throw it to the ground and trod upon it!  In his vindictive wrath, I might even burn it.  You get the gist here, I hope. <br /> <br />Is that all?  Characters I don't Care about, and who annoy me.  A writing style that is painful, wit that lacks wittiness, a plot that runs on lucky events more than actual, well laid story, and motivations that are ridiculous.  Can I ever adequately express my frustration with this book?  I doubt it.  If you want a good fantasy about a boy and his pet, read Christopher Paolini's \\"Eragon\\".  Fantastic read.  Also, the Harry Potter series stands apart.  George R. R. Martin's \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" shouldn't be missed, nor should the Stephen Donaldson books about Thomas Covenant.  But WHATEVER you do, PLEASE, don't pay cash money or credit for this book.  you'll regret it. <br /> <br />Oh, also, the people who compare this to harry potter, let me bend your ear.  It is outrageous, insulting, and irreverant to compare this dribble to the work of J.K. Rowling, who is at once engaging, artful, and practical in her characterization and writing.  To say that this comes close to, or is better than the harry potter series is ludicrous, those who have said such are showing exactly what caliber their tastes are.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Being a fan of this movie for so many years I must say that this is the best of George A Romeros work...4 discs tons of content just makes it sweeter...to the kids who gave bad reviews...go buy a tellatubby dvd and be content!!5 stars!!PERIOD!!!
B000031WBV|5.0|This music is indescribably lovely - maybe I am more susceptible to its charms than most, as this is me, my soul, played out to music. How could anybody dislike this or dismiss it as background music. I am an avowed atheist but only when listening to this music am I able to question this belief. Oh, my memories, my emotions, this is quite honestly better than sex, the 'opposite of sex' but better! <br /> <br />Pursue these recordings on vinyl - all music is usually better on vinyl, but with top-division music like this, possessing it on vinyl means that instead of having just gorgeous music on your hands you have, almost literally, heaven.
0671578278|5.0|Here in the past month Bujold hooked me into the Vorkosigan saga (how have I managed to miss it for so many years?) and I'd thought I'd seen every twist there was. Now she gives us a Sci Fi Regency! And a great one! Certainly this is one of the most fun books of the series: hilarious, touching, imaginative, and all written in LMB's exquisite style. Even the dialogue tags made me laugh! Thank you, LMB, for a wonderful reading experience. I hope many more Miles books are coming. (PS: Please do something to help poor \\"idiot\\" Ivan!)
B000002GWN|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Joni Mitchell -- few in the history of recorded music have approached her prodigious talents as both a singer and a songwriter. That said, \\"Miles of Aisles\\" -- both the LP and the concert tour, was a disappointment. Her collaboration with Tom Scott and the LA Express worked poorly, despite the great sound of Scott's band. I actually attended the concert -- at Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass., about 500 years ago, and I remember feeling the same way back then.

B000002UB3|5.0|Please disregard all the bad reviews, some people lack taste in music. <br /> <br />Such a great album, nearly every song is pure gold.   <br /> <br />Come Together- I don't much care for it, I tend to shy away from the mainstream stuff.  Not a bad song, I just don't listen to it regularly. <br />Something- Classic.  One of Harrison's best pieces. <br />Maxwell's Silver Hammer- Somewhat childish, yes, but still kind of a 'cute' song.  Something you can sway back and forth to if you know what I mean. <br />Oh! Darling- One of my favourite songs, period.  You can't help but love Paul here especially when he's belting out the lyrics on the top of his lungs.  Pure beauty. <br />Octopus's Garden- Some don't like Ringo, I like this song.  Another childish one; however, it makes you smile and is fun to sing to. <br />I Want You- Bluesy song, I suppose.  I like it, I especially love the organ work after \\"she's so...\\". One of the better songs, I love them all pretty much so there is a high standard. <br />Here comes the sun- Another Harrison classic.  If you play guitar like me it's a great acoustic song for any occasion. <br />Because- Not one of the better songs, but still good. <br />You never give me your Money- One of the better tracks, funky piano during the \\"out of college\\" part. <br />Mean Mr. Mustard- Another fun song. <br />Polythene Pam- I don't care for it too much but it's not bad, of course. <br />She came in through the bathroom window- Yet another fun song..  As far as fun music goes nobody even comes close to being called close to close to close to close to close to (you get my point) the Beatles. <br />Golden Slumbers- I love this song, it is truly chilling.  The piano is great and the lyrics are absolutely beautiful.  The part where he really belts them out (Golden Slumbers...  rise) is a moment I'd like to live in the rest of my life.  Words cannot express how emotional and beautiful this song is. <br />Carry that weight- Not much capacity to it, a good song however. <br />The End- Gotta love the end of it. <br />Her Majesty- I just wish this song was longer, but on the other hand it's an interesting touch that is pure Beatles to have a 20-30 second song at the end.  I love it.   <br /> <br />This was the album that innitially got me into the Beatles so I would definately recommend it to anyone who wants to start. <br />
B0000029GA|5.0|I have been a large Nas fan since this album, and this is where it all begins.  Nas is one of the best rappers on the market, and many rap heads sleep on Nas.  He is more than just a rapper, he is a street poet, a MC.  A d*mned good one too, may I add.  I have ALL Nas albums, and I will rate them all with 5 stars!
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris asks and answers crucial questions about this post-9/11 world, but whether anyone cares to listen will determine our fate.  When an administration rife with religious fundamentalists in effect declares war on religious fundamentalists, or supports Israel primarily because its existence is required for a happy apocalyptic conclusion (except, of course, for Jews and other non-Christians), then we must ask ourselves whether leaps of faith are not in fact leaps into fire.  A humble ability to answer questions about god and the afterlife with the statement, \\"I don't know,\\" would surely serve us better than making the hallucinations of desert prophets come true.  This book is a step in the right direction.  It should be required high school reading, if only to serve notice that not everyone believes faith will save us.  Some of us believe quite the opposite, and the evidence is on our side.
0452281881|5.0|Comprised entirely of e-mails sent between coworkers (and the occasional friend & business associate), this novel was a refreshingly different take on the typical \\"office worker\\" novel. The action takes place at an English advertising firm, but the setting could just as easily be in the US. Powerplays, squabbling, and backstabbing abound - and as for the lost knickers? Well, that would be telling, wouldn't it?     The US edition has been slightly \\"American-ized\\", but it still captures the wit of the original version.
B000267JQK|5.0|\\"Disclaimer II\\" is a bit shameful. It is obvious this re-release of Seether's 2002 debut was put out not only to cash in on the buzz surrounding the re-make/collaboration of \\"Broken\\" (featuring new vocals and string arrangements by Amy Lee of Evanescence & frontman Shaun Morgan's girlfriend) that has been floating around the airwaves all spring/summer, but also to fill in the space where the band should be releasing a second album (of which, there are still no plans officially in place). Nevertheless, their label, Wind-Up, has put together an awesome deluxe package for us all to eat up at a reasonable price. In addition to the eight non-album tracks tacked on, we are treated to a bonus DVD which is the host of all of Seether's music videos (\\"Gasoline,\\" \\"Fine Again,\\" \\"Driven Under,\\" \\"Broken\\"), a short \\"Making-Of\\" featurette for the \\"Broken\\" video, and a 30-minute concert that plays out Seether's best material. The original album (on here, the first 12 songs) are also re-mixed by Bob Marlette (Saliva, Ill Nino) and have a few noticeable differences from the original mixes -- especially on \\"Driven Under,\\" which benefits from some beefier guitar tones in the chorus. The b-sides are a nice addition. You'll remember a few of them from soundtracks: The heavier \\"Out Of My Way\\" and \\"Hang On\\" appeared on the \\"Freddy Vs. Jason\\" and \\"Daredevil\\" soundtracks, respectively. The uncut version of \\"Sold Me\\" (from \\"The Punisher\\" soundtrack) is a nice touch, and it's kinda of cool to compare the two versions of \\"Broken\\" on the same disc (a lot of fans are split down the middle, I think they're both great). The rest of the songs are either completely new or just re-workings of old demos from when the band went by the name of Saron Gas, the highlights of this series being \\"Love Her\\" and \\"Cigarettes.\\" As for the original album, it's got a nice mix of slower songs (\\"Fine Again,\\" \\"Broken\\"), anthems (\\"Sympathetic,\\" \\"69 Tea\\") and grinding hard-rockers (\\"Needles,\\" \\"Pig\\"). If you liked the original, you should pick up this package that basically expands on the experience (even if it may be just a cheap cash-in). Plus, I get the feeling it's still gonna be a while before we hear new material from these guys...inal, you should pick up this package that basically expands on the experience (even if it may be just a cheap cash-in).

B0002IQNAG|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Night of the Living Dead, it's my fave movie of all time. I looked forward to seeing the sequel Dawn of the Dead and when I finally did I was horrified at how bad it was. It turned a frightening atmospheric and tense situation into a cheesy, laughable almost unwatchable film. The story is paper thin, the relationships between the characters that was the heart and soul of the NOTLD are gone in this one to make room for sequences that run on too long or have no reason for being. The zombies in the apartment scene are the only ones that convey any tension, once you enter the mall everything is lost and comical. The music and look of the film reminds me of some public service film I would watch on an old reel in school only having to do with funny looking zombies. With all its flaws though I was able to stay with the film up until the biker gang broke into the mall. This was completely out of left field and made no sense at all to the plot. It was like they had used up all their ideas so they came up with a biker gang. Pointless and useless and it is this very plot turn that sinks any hope of salvation for this movie. After this you know that no ending could save it. The exact same thing was done with 28 Days Later but instead of a biker gang it was some army guys. It sunk that movie too. With Dawn being so bad on its own I have no idea why someone would want a set with 3 versions of this movie, each differing by only slight edits or having a different soundtrack, or being a bit longer. It's still the same terrible movie and ultimately one of the worst ever. Therefore, I have no choice but to label this the worst DVD set ever. Terrible movie x 3 = terrible set.
0393035158|5.0|A must read.  In a time when terrorism dominates all discussion and religion plays a major role in shaping U.S and world policy, \\"The End of Faith\\" could not have been published at a more appropriate time.  I can say, without hesitation, that no matter where you stand politically or religiously, you will be enlightened by this book.
B0002IU988|3.0|Lets face it everyone Creed was some of the lamest formulaic pop-rock anyone has ever heard. Alter Bridge has thankfully not just written a bunch of Creed songs with different vocals. Bear in mind there are obvious similarities which can be expected from a somewhat one dimensional songwriter like Mark Tremonti but there are enough moves in the right direction that this cd is a good buy. If you're a Creed fan you're obviously gonna buy this if you hated Creed like I always have give this cd a shot its not what you'd expect. Pleasantly surprising is the best way to describe this album.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|This movie is by turns thought-provoking, disturbing, beautiful, and scary. This film reminds me in many ways of \\"Donnie Darko\\"- which is itself an only slightly more obfuscated love story. I watched the director's cut of \\"Butterfly Effect\\" before the theatrical release (Both are included on the DVD). I'm not sure which order would have been better. As it was the alternate ending in the director's cut left me slackjawed and a wee bit depressed. I do not count this as a bad thing; I like for movies to have an emotional impact. For those reviewers and critics that can't get past the fact that Ashton Kutcher is playing a serious role (and very well I might add) I say: GET OVER YOURSELVES! If you can't get past the fact that he was in \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" then you aren't doing your job as moviewatchers.
B00005JMX6|5.0|Grade: A+ <br /> <br />I was expecting this movie to be more of a slapstick humor American Pie type.  And was absolutely surprised.  This movie has become one of my favorites.  Like it says on the case this movie \\"it's Risky Business meets American Pie.\\"  But with a lot more sensitivty than either films.  The characters are attractive and likeable.   <br /> <br />Emile Hirsch plays Matthew, an ambitious overachiever, but a kid who is still confused and unsatisfied with his highschool experience even towards the end of his senior year.   Emile provides a vulnerability to his role that really hit home with me.  I felt a connection with him.  Elisha Cuthbert plays Danielle, a former porn star who wants to break away from her past but is having trouble adjusting to different environment.  You may think Elisha Cuthbert was put in this movie just to attract a teenage male audience, but she is exceptional and absolutely shines, it would not have been the same movie with either actors.  She brings confidence and emotion to all of her scenes, which makes her character even more attractive and believeable.  There is a definite chemistry between the two on screen, and you get to see how Danielle helps Matthew find a love, passion and excitement that he didnt know he could have. <br /> <br />The score is also excellent, including some great songs by the Who and David Grey (they even featured the main song from Risky Business, Love on a Real Train).  However it is a shame some of these were missing on the Soundtrack.   <br /> <br />This movie is often compared to Risky Business (the similarities are obvious), but there is a genuine sincerity and sweetness to this movie that is not in Risky Business.  Risky Business is more about coming of age in the form of lust and fantasy rather than romance.  The character Danielle is given much more depth than Rebbecca DeMornay's character in Risky Business.  However, it is wrong to compare the two movies because though there are many parallels between them, the overall messages in the two films are very different.  Even though I like Risky Business, I actually found this movie a lot more heartwarming.   <br />

B0002234LS|4.0|I don't know what it was about the movie \\"Secret Window\\" that didn't get me to like it as much as I had anticipated. I mean they followed the book so accurately except for a few switches like the location being New York instead of Maine, and the acting was superb, but why did I not like it? Maybe it could be the fact that I read the book then saw it, or the fact that I knew what was going to happen (which I didn't. The ending was changed too) or maybe it's just me, but it was good for a one time veiwing. It was good enough to follow the book but you'll understand if you see it. I still give it four stars.    Mort Rainey (played by the fabulous Johnny Depp) is still wallowing in self-pity after the recent divorce of his wife Amy, after finding out she had had an affair. With his elderly dog Chico, the two are spending what seems a long time up at Morts getaway cabin. But things begin to go wrong once a strange redneck from Mississippi drives up and says to Mort, \\"You stole my story\\". After numerous tries to tell the Mr. \\"John Shooter\\" that the story he claims Mort stole was published two years before, all hell breaks loose as it is for sure Mr. Shooter isn't going to take this lying down. It's an authors worst nightmare come true.    No way is the acting bad. It seems a little off, but it is still good especially by the impeccable Johnny Depp. The woman who played his wife did a very good job herself too, and of course the guy who played the infamous John Shooter was perfect for the part, you have to admit that. They got all the characters right which I was happy about.    As for storywise, the ending was maybe even better than the books ending, I'm not really sure but I know it's only one of those movies that only good once and if you see it again, it's just not as good. Maybe it wasn't even good at all, I don't know. I'd give it three stars except for the fact that they followed alot of things super close to the book so you can't beat that.    I'd recommend the book over the movie even though the movie had a lot of the good tension that crawls into your skin a lot of the time. The thing about the book is that you have to imagine it, and it's not being put upon a screen and being imagined for you. When you think about it though, sometimes things like this can happen. Maybe it's not all horror stories. Authors are put under a lot of stress, and you never know if Stephen King sometimes draws his stories from experience thus resulting in his short story Secret Window, Secret Garden. Oh well. Keep it up Johnny with the great performances.
B00005A46U|5.0|I believe that this is one of the best canterbury prog rock (as this type of music is often called) albums of all times. I also beleive this is one of the best english rock records ever because of it's rock roots. Something magic happened during these sessions and Caravan never made another one quite like this (my humble opinion). If you are listening to a lot of Neo-prog (uhhhgg!) or find that you are searching for adventurous-yet-melodic music but not finding it, i suggest you check the work of some of the creators of the genre and stop wasting valuable time. Along with Yes, Mothers of Invention, Genesis, Hatfield & the North, Gentle Giant, Gilgamesh, Soft Machine, Robert Wyatt, Camel, ELP,  Van Der Graff, King Crimson, Matching Mole, Albert Marcoeur, Magma, Henry Cow, Gong, National Health and others too many to mention, these guys are on top of the list as one of the best 'early' bands to inject some  thinking into their 'rock' music. And this one in particular is a great introduction to the band and to the canterbury style.
B0000399WI|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption has a couple of violent parts in it, and a little bit of rough language, BUT - if that's not an instant disqualifier for you it is also one of the best movies you'll ever see.  I don't agree with those who voted it on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.COM) the #2 film of all time - ahead of Casablanca and everything but \\"The Godfather\\", but it's still a dang good thing to watch.<br /><br />Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne is that rarity of a prison inmate - he actually HAS been unjustly sent up river.  To make matters worse, the warden at his prison (Bob Gunten's Warden Samuel Norton) is a sadistic troll of a man.  But Andy has intelligence and patience, and much of the film is about how Andy comes to gain the respect of his fellow inmates as well as the Warden.  Andy is a financial wiz and he makes the Shawshank Prison a money-making enterprise for the Warden.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is wonderful as Red, a prison \\"Lifer\\" who carries the weariness of his life matter-of-factly and befriends Andy.  I'd love to tell you the story, but that would detract from the pleasure of discovering it yourself.  You know that feeling that you get when you're sitting down to a favorite meal - you just KNOW it's going to be good.  If you haven't seen \\"Shawshank\\" before and you like movies, that's the way you should feel.  At the end of the movie I have that same satisfied, \\"I'm Full\\" feeling that I'd have after a nice Lobster dinner topped off with a slice of Cheesecake.  This movie sticks to my ribs.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Coming out of \\"The Green Mile\\" my sister-in-law remarked \\"Boy, that was a good story!\\"  My brother, knowing it unlikely that she would know who wrote the original story, decided to have a little fun with her.<br /><br />\\"Did you know that the same guy who wrote this story wrote 'The Shawshank Redemption'?\\" (Shawshank is a favorite among everyone I know who has seen it.)<br /><br />\\"Wow\\", Sis replied.  \\"That guy should write some more!\\"<br /><br />The last time I checked Stephen King had written something like 100 books and about 65 of them had been turned into movies.lied.  \\"That guy should write some more!\\" <br /> <br />The last time I checked Stephen King had written something like 100 books and about 65 of them had been turned into movies.

B000002BMD|5.0|I wont write about the story that surround the making of this album (lots of people took care of that already), I just wanted to tell you that trhis is probably the best album the manics ever recorded (along with the darker and angrier \\"holy bible\\"), but this is another story. Here in EMG the band displays some of their better constructed songs, the epic sound of: design for life, the girl who wantde to be god, everything must go (kind of a spector - clash sound), the guitar anthem \\"australia\\", the moving and powerful rocker \\"enola/alone\\" the great closer \\"no surface all feelngs\\", although the second part of the album seems a bit weaker (but you have to consider that the first half is no less than brilliant) this is a very solid affair and a recommended purchase, guaranteed.
B00004XPPB|3.0|<br />This film portrays a realistic look at the inner-workings of the Mafia, where respect is earned and rats are burned.  I would argue that it is good that it lacks the romanticism of the Godfather, b/c that film was a fairy tale.   <br /> <br />I was refreshed by the multidimensional role of lefty (played by Pacino).  You see the hard-nosed street-toughened gangster and then you see a more vulnerable side to his character. <br />

B0002234LS|3.0|Secret Window is classic Stephen King, not in the sense that it will ever be immortalized as a masterpiece of cinema or revered by movie fans for its pace and direction. No this movie (based on the King story) is classic in the sense that so many of the elements of this story have already appeared in other works from the horror maestro. Throughout the movie shades from both `The Shining' and `The Dark Half' abound and ultimately detract from the presentation with a distinct sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and `they did it better in...' pervading the movie.<br /><br />The story centers around a washed up writer Mort Rainey (played by Johnny Depp) consumed in alcohol and depression over a failed marriage and writers block who is shocked by the arrival of a stranger who accuses him of stealing his story (the `Secret Window' of the title). Things get worse for Mort as Shooter becomes increasingly violent and Rainey slips deeper into paranoia and insanity before a shocking climax. Depp does his best with the material he is given and this movie at times comes close to creating some real chilling scenes. John Turturro also turns in a memorable performance as John Shooter and Maria Bello elicits a great deal of sympathy as Morts (soon-to-be) ex-wife Amy, a character wracked with uncertainty about stepping out after the shelter of married life.<br /><br />Supporting performances by Timothy Hutton and Charles Dutton are both admirable, if both the characters they portray are slim on actual characterization and Len Cariou turns in a surprisingly good performance as Sheriff Newsome.<br /><br />Good for fans of the genre and people looking to be mildly entertained, just don't go in expecting to be particularly surprised by anything.

6302054982|5.0|The simple fact of the matter is that the guys in la cosa nostra are just regular guys like us.  Henry Hill (played by Liotta) always wanted to be a gangster, who makes his way to the upper echelons of the Lucchese crime-family working on large jobs and managing risks.  Jimmy Conaway (played by De Niro) is his partner in crime and very much a sociopath. <br /> <br />This film portrays a realistic look at the guys, who are not \\"made-men\\" <br />
B00003CXCT|2.0|I can't resist - I must add my two cents: <br /> <br />Like many others, I grew up in the seventies, and my life was changed when I saw Star Wars in the theaters (many times).  I haven't decided yet if I'm going to buy the new release, I probably will, but it's extremely irksome to me (if not downright painful), to watch a masterpiece get defiled this way. <br /> <br />I guess I don't have a problem with them cleaning up the picture and subtly enhancing some of the effects that are ALREADY THERE.  In fact, I don't have much problem with anything except the Mos Eisley scene, where the most radical alterations can be found.  In the original version, the city had a kind of appealing desolation about it that made it feel like a kind of Tombstone Texas in space.  Now, with the new version, it is populated - in fact SWARMING with CGI creatures.  The problem with CGI is that no matter how \\"realistic\\" it is, it still looks like CGI.  So instead of everything on screen being real, now we are sitting there thinking \\"Wow, look at all the cool CGI creatures\\".  Not for a moment is it believable - not for one moment are we convinced that what we are watching is real.  Instead of immersing us in the story, CGI jerks us back to reality and reminds us that we are watching a movie.  I believe that some day, maybe 10 years from now, we are going to look back at all the CGI and say \\"what were we thinking!\\"  It's going to become as out-of-style as 70's pointy-collared polyester shirts. <br /> <br />But I can point to the exact moment in the new version when it fell apart completely.  As our heroes are making their way through the streets, we see a Jawa riding on the back of some big lizard thing.  The lizard thing rears up, the Jawa slips off its back and as the Jawa is swinging from the reigns, it yells \\"Wheeee!\\"   \\"Wheeee\\" ?!?!?!?!????????   My God, George, what made you think that was a good idea.  First of all, there was always something sinister and a little creepy about the Jawas.In the original they were never used for comic relief.  Jawas are smelly, greedy, mysterious, even dangerous little creatures - and they don't say \\"Wheee\\"!  By inserting that one little cute exclamation, the entire movie falls from being believable to being UN-believable - it's like a pop-up ad that reminds us \\"YOU ARE ONLY WATCHING A MOVIE - LOOK, HUMOR!\\"  It is so blatant, tactless, contrived, un-subtle, obnoxious and out-of-place that if I didn't know better, I'd think someone was INTENTIONALLY trying to yank us out of the movie experience. <br /> <br />The reason Return of the Jedi doesn't work, is that, for some reason, George Lucas became cute and slapstick.  Over time he began inserting more and more cuteness and slapstick into his movies.  But the original Star Wars, episode IV, had very little of that - and what it did have was believable in the context of the story.  And that is what makes a difference between a masterpiece and just a movie.  Every film masterpiece has one thing in common:  all aspects are believable and realistic within the context of the story.   <br /> <br />What George Lucas has done is add UN-realistic details to his one and only masterpiece.  Now, we can't watch the movie without being rudely reminded that we are watching a movie.  NOW, Mr. Lucas, you no longer have a masterpiece.  All you have is a pretty good movie.  And it's incredibly sad.
0815411839|4.0|I have read many Marilyn bios, and this is the only one that finally gets the details right, not only about her life, but also the sad truth about her death. Thank you for giving her the justice of piecing together what really happened.
0743243315|4.0|I'm not yet through reading this book - I'm keeping the last chapters for tomorrow after I devoured two thirds of the book in a few hours. I walk around the house with the feelings described by the author pasted to my skin. <br />Monica Ali's writing is simple as are simple the characters of the book - gathering Dostoyevsky's challenge for writers to bring simple people to the fore of their literary art: the world is not made of exceptions but of rules, not of geniuses but of common men and women. <br />The main character's view of the world is restricted by culture, religion and lack of education to little more than a keyhole. She spies life and does not live it. She feels it, but cannot analyze it. It passes by as she waits, she suffers, she questions and censors her own questions. <br />Yes, there are contradictions, there are passages that have a limp logic, but only inasmuch as the character is limp in her thinking, for her ignorance, for her fear. Compare the forceful letters of the sister, who faces life head up - a totally different style, respectful of the character's psychology. <br />All the other characters are equally well portrayed and since two days ago have given bright colors to the images of my dreams, almost too much... <br />Finally, what is a good book? One that makes you want to rush to the end, but also to sip it slowly, to enjoy unwrapping it. One that uses a rich vocabulary with no pretense if not the pleasure of writing - or reading. One that helps you untangle the complexity of the world, allowing you to know it and to love it just a little bit more. <br />A great first novel. <br />
B00003CX5P|5.0|Nice addition to the series, loved the podrace. Acting was all right, and the plot filled in with the original trilogy nicely. We can only hope EIII will be as good as this ands II.
076790592X|4.0|I liked this book, I really did. I don't quite think it really merits its EXTRAORDINARY success, but I definitely do think it deserves many, many accolades. I also read Albom's novel, \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven,\\" and also rate that four stars.     Albom has an engaging writing style. You will not be wasting your time with either of these books, trust me.    I want to express here my gratitude to Mr. Albom. I was very upset when Mad Mel came out with his virulently anti-Semitic, disgustingly violent \\"The Passion of the Christ.\\" I would never see it, but I was upset by all that I read about it. I will always remember reading about a mother who took her two kids to see the movie (I think they were ages eight and nine), and the usher at the movie politely suggested that the movie might not be appropriate for the kids. According to the story, she practically cursed out the usher, incensed that he was questioning her judgement. After I read that story, I happened to come across Albom's scathing review of this movie on the Internet. Everything he said I agreed with 100%. Like I said in my title, Albom is one of the good guys.

B00013F35I|3.0|I have been reading the other reviews and there are some really accurate ones out there, yes Bruce looks like hes tired, he looks old, hey, if you jumped around the stage for 30 years straight, put on 4 hour concert for 25 years you would look old too. Give the guy a break, I was dissapointed in the sound on this one, Bruce should do indoor shows, he sounds so much better. I went to the Hartford show on this tour and it was in a football stadium, I couldnt believe how far away he sounded. I thought he was in another county, thought the setlist was much better for this tour, I was glad to hear more material off Born in the USA this time around, Dancing in the Dark was nice to hear, I could see Bruce was just so thrilled about doing that song again live(NOT) just for the fans. \\"Born in the USA\\" the album version was great to hear, he did a great job with this tune. The rest of the songs are standards from the last tour. Hope hes in better shape for the \\"Vote For Change Tour\\" I think \\"Born in the USA\\" should be dedicated to John Kerry....sorry for the political view. (yikes) <br />Anyways, decent show from Spain but not his best.  <br />
0393035158|4.0|I thank the author for having the courage to write this book.  Sadly, he will probably receive death threats from many \\"believers.\\"  This book should be on the required reading list of every college worldwide.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I am one of the many people that never gave Slipknot a second thought in the past. Always put off by the whole scary masks gimmick, I just wrote them off as another metal band...until now. This is a great album. Never ever hearing their past albums (I just might pick up the other two to compare), this album is just top notch in terms of metal. Whether it was their time to mature or the influence of Rick Rubin on this album, in terms of song structure, melody and musicianship, I am very impressed and play this CD over and over, much to my neighbors' dismay.<br /><br />If your are like me and love heavy metal, but thought Slipknot was crap, give this album a chance and you won't be disappointed.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|for the person who was asking about the song when uma breaks her way out of the casket.......the name of the song is L'Arena by Ennio Morricone, a composer who did the music for most of the spaghetti western movies.  and does anybody know THE SONG FROM KILL BILL VOLUME 1 WHEN UMA IS STANDING BEHIND SOPHIE AND SHE CALLS LUCY LIU OUT, BEFORE SHE CUTS SOPHIES ARM OFF? I HAVE BOTH SOUNDTRACKS AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM HAS THAT SONG, THE SONG IS CHANTING ALMOST LIKE A GROUP OF JAPANESE INDIANS (WEIRD EXAMPLE) IF ANYONE KNOWS THE NAME OF THE SONG OR IF IT IS ON THE SOUNDTRACKS AND IM MISSING IT PLEASE TELL ME. IF U CANT REMEMBER WATCH KILL BILL VOL 1 AND GO TO THE PART RIGHT BEFORE UMA CUTS SOPHIES ARM OFF.
B00004TJKB|5.0|Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful, movie. Everything is perfect -- the story, the writing, the acting, the scenery, just everything.    I rented this movie for the first time about two months ago, and since then, I have seen it at least 25 times.    If you don't like movies that are sweet, charming, DECENT, funny, genteel, life-affirming, heartwarming and feel-good, then this is not for you. Not to fret -- most contemporary movies are the antithesis of this gem, so you have plenty to choose from.    I'm gonna buy this movie, and watch it many, many more times. BRAVO to all involved!!
B00005JMAH|5.0|This review assumes that you've already either seen the movie or read the book.  I won't go into the plot here.   <br /> <br />I'll say upfront that this movie was brilliantly done.  Alfonso Cuarn truly captured the darker, more complex mood that J.K. Rowling gave to the third installment of the series.  The cinematography and visual effects were excellent.  I also thought that the soundtrack was absolutely perfect (if interested, please see my separate review for the soundtrack).  <br /> <br />The kids are beginning to really mature in this film.  Their acting, which is evidently becoming more natural and fluid, has improved a hundred times over since Chamber of Secrets.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione become closer in this story, and their friendships are even more important than before.  I get the sense that Daniel, Rupert, and Emma are also becoming great friends, as their friendships on the screen seem so natural.  The three have a great chemistry.  Some complain that the kids are growing too fast, but I just don't see it.  Kids their age simply grow at an exponential rate.  I assume this also holds true in the wizarding world.  They seem about the right age to me. <br /> <br />The casting for the new characters is pretty good.  David Thewils is a fantastic Professor Lupin, and Emma Thompson is a perfectly clumsy and mystical Profesor Trelawney.  I did not, however, warm up so well to Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore.  But I think (hope) that will change with time.  Gambon is obviously a good actor, and I think that if I hadn't already gotten used to Richard Harris, I would have said that his portrayal of Dumbledore was convincing.  Hopefully, Gambon will grow on me in Goblet of Fire. <br /> <br />Now for the \\"qualified\\" portion of my review. . . . I give this movie five stars from the perspective of someone who had read the book first.  I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed the fast-paced movie as much if I had not already known what was going on.  I did not, however, give this factor too much weight in my assessment because, given the time constraints of the movie, it probably had to be geared toward people who had already read the book.  Of course there were many missing details -- the background about Sirius and Lupin could have used more explanation, and the secondary characters did not get much face time -- but deciding what to cut and what to keep is incredibly difficult when you adapt a 435-page book (each page packed with information) to a 140-minute movie.  I believe that given the complexity of the story and the time constraints of the movie, the crew did a fantastic job with making those decisions; and that is why I give the movie five stars.  Remember, the perfect Harry Potter movie would be about 8 hours long.  That's just not possible.  (Although, if it were, I would certainly sit through it!) <br /> <br />Now for my favorite parts of the movie. . . . (1) I think my favorite part of the movie was the time-turner sequence.  This was brilliantly done.  I even looked for flaws the second and third times I watched the film, and I found none.  Emma Watson was brilliant in this scene!  (2) Aunt Marge's \\"blow up\\" sequence was absolutely hilarious.  (3) The Hogsmeade scene with the snowball fight was fun, and Daniel Radcliff did an excellent job with the scene where he \\"overhears\\" that Sirius is his godfather. <br /> <br />Long story short, this DVD is a must-have for Harry Potter movie fans.  I think this movie is even better than the first two, and the DVD will be a good supplement for when you don't have time to re-read the book!
B00005JN2X|5.0|Jamie Foxx is astonishing as a taxi driver who seems to have it all together at first and who, after a difficult evening out with hired killer Tom Cruise, discovers that he hasn't been as well adjusted as he's thought.  He's delayed opening his own business with the excuse that he needs more time to conceptualize it until it's \\"perfect.\\"  And he's lonely too, and hasn't had a date in quite a while because he lives in his mind.  Under the most horrifying of circumstances, Foxx's character, Max Durocher, has his whole world collapse around him, and he finds out to his surprise, that it isn't 100% negative thing.  I kept thinking maybe the writers called him \\"Durocher\\" to remind us of the old time ballplayer Leo Durocher and his famous saying that \\"Nice guys finish last.\\"<br /><br />Cruise is very good, although he isn't asked to give the acting workout that Jamie Foxx undergoes.  And Jada Pinkett Smith, short as she is, makes interesting acting choices in what could have been a nothing role as the US attorney, Annie, who becomes Max's love interest.  And there are other great actors let loose in this wildly entertaining film, everyone from Irma Hall to Javier Bardem to Mark Ruffalo, who seems to make every other film that's released nowadays but who won't find another one soon with as much topnotch quality and mass appeal.
B0000541AM|5.0|\\"Can...you..dig it?!'...\\"Warriors...come out and play-aaaa!\\"...\\"Can you count, suckas!\\"...and my personal favorite: \\"The Lizzies are packing!\\" <br /> <br />This is the ultimate cult classic: Walter Hill's controversial \\"The Warriors\\" is insanely addictive in repeated viewings, thanks to its compelling plot and creative characters. <br /> <br />A gang-the Warriors, natch-are framed for murdering a rival top gang leader, putting a price on each gang member's head in the process. The gang must make way to their Coney Island sanctuary before dawn least they get popped. Like Homer's \\"Odyssey\\", they meet a varied assortment of quirky people and bloodthirsty gangs along the journey, barely escaping peril along the way. If that doesn't interest you, you're cleary not an action movie fan. <br /> <br />Such a great flick deserves a special edition dvd; unfortunately, Paramount merely released a bare-bones dvd with a ho-hum packaging (if they ever do a special edition set, they just have to have the original cool \\"They're out to get the Warriors\\" poster to serve as the cover). Only the sleek theatrical trailer is included as an extra. Even the menu screen stinks. Paramount, please, give \\"the Warriors\\" fans the true special edition dvd they deserve! You will make $$$! <br />  <br />That said, I sure hate to see this movie being remade today; they'd probably make it all \\"bling-bling\\" and have Ja Rule play Swan or something. So catch this movie before McG gets his ruddy paws on it. <br /> <br />Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to strut on the beach while Joe Walsh's \\"In the City\\" is played in the background.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I had the pleasure of witnessing an hour performance at largest International jazz festival, in Montreal, If any one thinks the CD is great, wait for the live performance and it will further blow you away, she is spellbinding commanding the stage captivating the audience, her innocence makes it so real and personal, and what impress me the most is that she spend almost an hour after the performance with members of the audience one on one until everyone was gone. The trumpet solos where incredible, the band was perfect, it was by far the big band style that was unique to the festival, how they fit all of them on the small stage was a miracle, the horn section that where adopted the very same day from visiting artists show the nature of an amazing festival, in the program they listed her 20 years of age and a cross of Ella - Patsy Cline - Billy Holiday all in one, wow. I guess they could not believe the age so they wrote 20! All I can say that she set the stage on fire. The performance puts the amazing CD to shame, I cannot wait for a north American tour, I am sure she will sell out, look out for the Grammy, if Norah can pull it off, she can raise the bar.

Paulo Coelho cites an example of a young shepherd who dreams about a hidden treasure and his determination to fulfill the same. The author takes us beautifully through the vast journey of this boy in pursuit of his dream describing the various setbacks, struggles, omens leaving a message for the readers at each step, the most important of them is to believe in our self and in our dreams. <br />The book though translated, the language is lucid and words leave a lasting impression,wanting us to take the journey again. <br />This book is an enriching experience, a must read for all. <br />
0393035158|5.0|I just spent the weekend reading The End of Faith.  I am so impressed that someone has finally put it right out there -- we live with myths ruling our lives and never bother to question them.  There is no arguing with Mr. Harris.  He makes a solid case and, may I add, a very sympathetic, although disturbing one.  Unless we start to talk about what Mr.Harris has so boldly put on paper, we face a terrible future.  Are we still of such flat earth mentalities that we will continue to live in fantasy and destroy each other. Congratulations to the author for writing what so many are afraid to say and writing it with such grace.
0156027321|2.0|Although the author says he will make you believe in God, he never follows that up with anything persuasive.  There were points when I cringed because it was so cheesy.  I don't know how this book won the Booker Prize.  At most, this is a cute story.  There are many other survival stories that are better.
B000092ZYX|5.0|First off, Radiohead is a band that you either like or don't. People that say I like a few songs are lying. Second, please stop comparing this album to a bit of something from each of the albums. This album sounds like HTTT and nothing else. Take it for what it is. This album could sound better than OK Computer to you if you just didn't try to compare it to it. This albm is amazing. Stop complaining about it and think could you even come close to writing a song nearly as amazing as Wolf at the Door. I was glued to every song. Not one is dull. Each one has its own texture and identity. From the great electonica of Backdrifts or to the grooving A Punch-up at a Wedding to the simnple straight forward rock of Go To Sleep. This album has everything. I think it is the easiest Radiohead album to get into other than the Bends. These guys are the best band on earth. Give them a break and some respect for a change.

B00009RDG9|4.0|Other reviewers have already commented on action, plot, etc., so I would like to take this into realms psychological.<br /><br />First of all, this film is a wonderful demonstration of a thesis basic to depth psychology:  those mythic stories we fail to take account of when they address us get lived out unconsciously.  \\"Mythic\\" in the sense of a primordial tale, not an archaic explanation.  The primordial tale addressing these two men is that of Abraham and his son Isaac.  The narrative voice at the start of the film lets us know that:  \\"And God said, Abraham, kill me a son.\\"  This, then, is the given, the symbolic framework in which the older tracker/weapons master and the young soldier must operate.<br /><br />Then comes the personal.  L. T. (Tommy Lee Jones) learned how to track, hunt, survive, and kill from his own father.  He taught those skills to Aaron, but they were not enough.  Overloaded with the stresses of war's insanity, Aaron writes to L. T. for help, but the older man does not know what to do, how to help (perhaps because his own father did not).<br /><br />There are many traditions and myths describing how the older men initiate the younger ones into adulthood.  This film depicts a failed initiation:  the dilemma of an elder who ought to be a mentor but, never having been mentored himself, cannot give the male blessing to the younger man who needs it so badly.  Because of this, both have little choice but to live out the story of Abraham and Isaac in its most destructive implications.
B00003CX9W|4.0|Walt had a dream once: to have a marriage of music and images played at once, or in other words, to show you what you might be seeing in your mind if you were listening to the music. Theatres were outfitted with the 1940's equivalent of surround sound, which they called Fantasound. However, it was a costly affair, and some theatres didn't want to be outfitted with Fantasound. Critics were dumbfounded as they was no heros, heroines, monsters(well there is in a way) and typical Disney songs. Re-released quite a bit, it recently started to develop steam as the film is a good example of being ahead of it's time, but that doesn't mean the film is flawless either.    Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor: Starts off with just the silhouettes of the players and conductors until it shows a sky with many violins syncopated to the music. Sets the tone for what's coming. 9/10    Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite: Rather than follow the traditional story, Disney followed a different approach by animating the four seasons in the form of ballet. With mushrooms, birds and these weird little angels skating on ice, it's a classic case of Disney showcasing it's talent in animation...by hand, nonetheless. 10/10    Dukas's The Sorceror's Apprentice: A newly designed(at the time) Mickey Mouse snatches his masters hat and makes a broom do his chores. Only he falls asleep and the broom overflows the room. Mickey tries to break it but the broom multiplies until the master sets things right. Classic scene. 10/10    Stravinsky's Rite of Spring: As Stravinsky said \\"to show primitive life\\", Disney animated the life and death of the dinosaurs. One thing that I wouldn't have mind seeing is the meteor theory, but they use the heatwave theory. When the continents seperate though, it's awesome, it just feels long. 8/10    Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony: Beethoven's lively music set to mythical creatures. I'm sure someone's already mentioned the edit on here so I won't go through it but it's far from offensive. 9/10    Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours: Dancing hippos and crocodiles(or are they alligators?). Anyway, it's a nice fun scene. 8/10    Moussorgsky's A Night on Bald Mountain: if you've ever played Kingdom Hearts right to the end, chances are he seems familiar. This is where he came from. Parent groups wanted this scene out of the re-release but I'm glad it's still in. By the way, according to Kingdom Hearts, his name is Chernabog. 10/10    Schubert's Ave Maria: a beautiful song and odd but hopeful images. It's basically these things with lightbulb heads walking somewhere until the end when we start from inside a mountain till we get outside to a nice sunrise. This was done with Disney's Multi-plane camera, which allowed for one continuous shot. It's a nice scene and a great end to the film. 9/10    Now you notice each scene got 8 or higher. But I suggest you don't watch them all at once. The movie really feels its length or maybe I'm just tired but the movie felt longer than normal. But it's still something that has to be seen.
B0000TB014|5.0|This compilation is very much like 1995's HISTORY. The only original tracks are ONE MORE CHANCE(not to be confused with the Jacksons' recording from their 1984 VICTORY album),and a live version of BEN,Michael Jackson's solo debut hit from '72. Some of the tracks have been slightly edited from their original album versions. One of them was DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH from 1979's OFF THE WALL. The intro is not heard on this album(MJ briefly speaks). This album has four different cover concepts. The photos were taken,respectively,in 1979,1987,the early 90's and sometime this decade. A must for all MJ fans.
B0000022WA|5.0|This is one of my FAVORITE Maureen O'Hara movies. I laugh every time I watch it. This movie stars Hayley Mills and co-stars Maureen O'Hara, Brian Keith, and Joanna Barnes. This movie is all about twin sisters Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers and how they meet up in camp. They decide to switch places. Susan would go live with her mother (Maureen O'Hara) and Sharon would go live with her father (Brian Keith) with the hopes that their parents would figure them out, switch them back, and fall in love again. Sounds like a lot for two thirteen year old girls! But the pull it off. Susan finally tells her mother who she really is, and they go out to California to switch back. But the plans of Sharon and Susan are crushed because their father is getting married to Vickie Robinson (Joanna Barnes). Sharon and Susan try to rekindle the romance between their parents by recreating their first date. It doesn't exactly work, however, and Sharon and Mrs. McKendrick plan to leave the next day. The twins trick their parents yet again and dress exactly the same. They say if their parents can tell them apart, then they'll go. If not, then they all have to go on a camping trip together. So, they go on the camping trip. But when Vickie gets upset because Mr. Evers is going with his ex-wife, Mrs. Mckendrick steps out of the picture and lets Vickie go in her place. So the twins sabotage the trip by making it impossible for Vickie to stand it. The wedding is off, and... do I have to say anymore? This is a classic and I urge you to see it!!

We watch this tape just about every day and still enjoy watching it from beginning to end. My husband is even asking me when the Riverdance show is coming to town so we can order tickets! So order it and enjoy! You won't be disappointed :)
B000002G60|5.0|In Nine Objects of Desire Suzanne Vega is a songwriter on the very top of her game.  Intelligent songwriting is a quantity in very short supply these days and Vega makes it look easy, with each song telling a different story.  One would think that the music might suffer when so much attention has been paid to the lyrics, but this is not the case, musically each song is very well crafted.  Many of the songs have a haunting or spooky quality to them, perhaps most exemplified by \\"Headshots,\\" which probably got the most radio airplay, but they are all very evocative.  \\"Nine Objects...\\" is what every album should be like, no clinkers among the bunch.
B00000F0KC|5.0|This is one of the funniest, if not THE funniest Wayne/O'Hara movies ever! You never stop laughing - AT ALL!!!!!!!!!  <br />  Summary: G.W. McLintock (John Wayne) owns more than half of the land in the territory. He is visited by his wife, Kahtarine (Maureen o'Hara), who says she wants a divorce. But McLintock won't give it to her. Then she says that their daughter, Rebecca (Stefanie Powers) is coming home from school. Kahtarine wants to take her to live with her at the capital. but he says no yet again. She becomes infuriated with him and he leaves. G.W. then hires a settler, Devlin Warren (Patrick Wayne), to work for him. He also hires his mother (Yvonne De Carlo) to cook for him. So all is well - until Mrs. McLintock takes charge!!! She moves back in with G.W. and takes over the house. The next day, they find out that one of the settler's daughters was kidnapped by the Indians - so they thought. I turns out, that her and one of the other settlers went for a moonlit ride and \\"the horse ran away\\". They all got into a big fight which ended up with everyone falling into the huge mudpit at the bottom of the hill. Even Mrs. McLintock!
B000286S8S|5.0|This is a perfect CD for anyone; the casual Van Halen listener, the EVH understudy, the hard-core fan... it's all here for you! Eddie's hottest licks, the greatest songs, all bundled up into a great looking package!<br /><br />I've been into Van Halen for a while, but never actually bought one of their albums for myself. I usually grab my brother's CDs and take them along with me on a car ride or whatever, and when they're playing, I'd usually skip to my favorite songs first.<br /><br />Not anymore! The great thing about compilation albums is that you get the \\"best\\" of their albums all packed on to one disk. I saw some \\"The Best Of\\" CDs of Van Halen, but they lacked content (and I was somewhat disappointed). But now you get 2 CDs that are PACKED TIGHT with great Van Halen tunes that spans their entire career. I love it!

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|What a kick! What an absolute joy! Warning, many more superlatives to follow. To be perfectly honest ( something I'm prone to do from time to time! ) I had purchased this disc last night while visiting a local bookseller ( who shall remain nameless ) simply due to the untimely passing of Mr. Charles. Up to this point my music library lacking anything by this extroadinary keyboardist/singer I felt it would be my way of paying homage to this gentle mans not so small creativity and improving my music collections apparent shortcoming in the way of having on hand some fine Soul/R&B. Two birds with one stone wouldn't you know. <br /> <br />From the first strands of \\" Here We Go Again \\" with the increasingly popular Norah Jones I was absolutely hooked with what I was hearing and found myself turning up the volume so as to not miss a beat of what was going on. Fortunately things only seem to improve from there and while I could go on ad naseum about how spectacular the disc really is I won't bother. Highlights for me though, and there are many, will be stated though with no small amount of enthusiasm. Lets see, Michael McDonalds fine take on the Stylistics classic \\" Oh Girl \\" a truly lovely rendition to be found here. Rays duet with the impeccable Diana Krall on \\" You Don't Know Me \\" really delicious and of course the showstopper \\" Crazy Love \\" with no other then Van Morrison himself! There are obviously other remarkable tunes to be found therein but why spoil it for anyone. Pick up your very own copy, let these remarkable tunes wash over you, and wonder at the genius that will always be Ray Charles. And while other reviewers have commented on Rays voice not being what it once was ( and whose is, I may add! ) that is certainly no reason to pass on this gem. As a matter of fact while Rays voice is not as strong as once upon a time his voice still carries a certain magic and heartbreaking true emotion that many singers can only dream about. Then again don't listen to my meanderings. Pick up your copy, pour a glass of wine and give a toast to a singer who deserves so much more then we could ever give. Genius indeed!
B00003CXCT|4.0|I am one of the many who DID give the special editions of the Star Wars Triliogy a chance. I purchased the original Star Wars Special Edition pack in VHS form several years ago. I had skipped going to the theatre to see them, so I was taking a chance by making the purchase. I was hoping I wouldn't feel let down by the changes Mr. Lucas made to his films. I didn't mind the visual enhancements, but some of the added scenes messed up these classics. The pacing in the movies was pretty clean and crisp before they were turned into \\"Special Editions\\", now the movies seem to drag a bit. <br /> <br />Special Editions are fine, but I'd love to own the originals in Widescreen DVD format. Coke came back as Coke Classic and New Coke was allowed to continue until New Coke died due to a lack of sales. Why can't we have a Star Wars Classic DVD pack being sold in edition to the Special Edition pack? I say let the fans decide which one they want. I'm sure alot of die hard fans would buy both as well and George Lucas could take home even more money. We'd all be winners if Mr. Lucas would allow the Classic vs. Special Edition battle to be waged in the market place instead of the realm of public opinions.

B00003CXCT|1.0|First of all I gave this one star because there is actually no such DVD yet - so people who are complaining are literally complaining about nothing (pun intended). <br /> <br />Secondly if you really don't want the additional scenes, special effects, etc, and you still have a copy of the original VHS version, then this is for you. <br /> <br />Add a video capture card and a DVD or CD burner to a PC or MAC, (any computer built in the last 6 years is fine), capture the tape to the hard disk and burn it to either a DVD or Video CD. <br /> <br />Make sure your DVD player is capable of playing CDRs, or DVD + or - Rs, most major electronics brands have this compatibility, but if yours doesn't then a new $100 Sony DVD player will definitely play your own, fully digital version of Star Wars.  I only suggest this make because I already know it works, and while I'm sure that most Panasonic, Pioneer, JVC, etc brands will work just as well, my experience is with Sony, so that's my recommendation. <br /> <br />Obviously the more expensive the video capture card, and the more powerful the computer then the better the quality of your creation, and obviously you'll need a decent VCR (preferably one that can output component video and dolby 5.1 audio) in order to get the highest quality playback for the capturing process. <br /> <br />So okay, this will set you back between $100 - $1000 depending on what you already own, but if you can't just press forward to get past the scenes you don't want to see then I suppose it'll be worth it to you. <br /> <br />So there you go - if they don't have the original versions of these movies on the DVDs, then why not make your own.  You do have the right to make a backup of your original tapes, and as long as you're not circumventing any form of copy protection, this is perfectly legal under your DMCA fair use rights.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So you're a network executive at Fox.  You've got your hands on Joss Whedon, a man whose first 2 series spawned a large and fiercely loyal fanbase (not to mention bouying an entire network through it's infancy).  He's making a show for you that screams \\"cult hit with crossover potential.\\"  What do you do? <br /> <br />In the unfortunate world that we are stuck in, you hide this show in your Friday night line-up, against JAG (which pretty well wrapped up the sitting at home at 8 on a friday night demographic), and give it a whopping 6 or 7 episode run before you cancel it.  They could offer up the excuse that it was too expensive to produce, but that just highlights the fact that they weren't even watching the show.  (The show is visually stunning at times, and every dollar spent on production cost is justified by the outcome). <br /> <br />Sorry to rant, but Fox blew it on this one.  Taking into account the current landscape of network television (which I refer to as \\"all reality crap, all the time\\") Firefly could be running strong as the best written/produced/acted show on TV.  All it would have taken from Fox was a little faith, a little time, and a little more advertising push.  This show had the potential to completely raise the bar for network programming. <br /> <br />I can't praise this show any better than any of the reviews posted here.  For my money, it's the best show to grace TV in the last few years.  Get your hands on this collection.  Buy it, Netflix it, however you like, and then watch all 14 episodes.  Then try to think of the last time television, basic cable, a movie, or anything else felt that solid, and left that much of an impression on you.  Finally, think about this.  Fans of Joss Whedon know that it takes a season or two for him to fully develop his characters and get everything moving in stride.  Think how great this show could have been if Fox had had a little more faith.   <br /> <br />As for me, I can't wait for the movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Moore's movie is a punch in the stomach for those who still think that America has gone at war in Iraq to protect freedom. <br />Some scenes are a punch in the stomach for everyone. <br />However, no member of the Bush Administration has so far been able to factually deny any of the detailed charges. Maybe they simply can't and they pretend they don't care.  <br /> <br />A part of America is frozen on a well-exploited terror wave and has given up some civil right inside and many human rights outside. But hope is not all gone yet. America is still the democracy that has allowed Moore to make such a great act of love for his Country and a deep act of respect for the young Americans who are giving their lives for..... Well... whatever your opinion is, just watch this movie, and think.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Brave New World thier 12 album <br /> <br />Brave New World is one of my favorite Maiden albums.  While I not dare rate it above the classics such as Number of the Beast, Piece of Mind and Powerslave I think it is in a comfortable position right behind those three.  The first seven songs on this album are amazing.  Track eight, Nomad, is good but not great and the final two are decent.  Whenever I hear Blood Brothers it sends chills down my spine.  I think it is great that this band has been around so long and can still make something like this.   <br />Hightlights Include; Wickerman, Ghost of the Navigator, Blood Brothers, and Dream of Mirrors
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I believe that Ray Charles' final album will be a major hit this year.  The duets he did here with some major artists are fabulous!  Brother Ray can still feel the rhythms of the songs here.  Norah Jones balances so very well with Ray's rasp in the opening song.  The duets with Natalie Cole, James Taylor, Gladys Knight, Willie Nelson, Johnny Mathis, Bonnie Raitt and others are all fabulous.  And I love Hey Girl with Michael McDonald. I disagree that Ray's voice may have lost its focus in some reviews.  Ray still sounded strong at 72 and 73 when he recorded this album!  I admire his willingness to continue to record because music was obviously his first love.  This is one of Brother Ray's best albums and will be just as much a classic years from now.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|\\"Genius Loves Company\\" is a masterpiece, the fitting capstone of a fifty year recording career by the master of international pop music. Ray Charles was a true genius, an artist of epic stature who devoted his life to weaving a tapestry of sound from every thread of American music. He was a painter with sound on plastic as Rembrandt was a painter with oil on canvas, and his dozens of albums will long be treasured, as Rembrandt's canvases are, for the depth of their insight into the human soul. <br />Ray made \\"Genius Loves Company\\" racing against the clock of his illness, and every note is imbued with his indomitable courage. Many of the songs, like \\"You Don't Know Me\\" and \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" date back deep into his career. The soulful presence of many of  Ray's singer friends and younger singers adds to the feeling that, in listening to \\"Genius Loves Company,\\" we are hearing a great patriarch of pop music. This album, a must for any Ray Charls fan, finishes, gloriously, a recording career that began in 1948. Three cheers for Ray Charles!!! <br /> <br />Michael Lydon is the author of \\"Ray Charles: Man and Music,\\" the definitive biography of the Genius, just republished in an updated edition by Routledge.
B000268QB2|4.0|Just a quick question...how old are these people doing the reviews for Amazon...12???  For those of us who happen to be over the age of changing voices and our first armpit hair, Keane's keyboards and melodies have a direct relationship to a relatively well known person of the 70's.  That person would happen to be Todd Rundgren. <br /> <br />I would have to say this album is the most pleasant surprise to come along in many years, and all I can say is it's about time.
B000002HMH|1.0|Load thier sixth album    Coming off thier most successful album Self titled Metallica, they released Load.  To put it plainly, its just not good.  To anyone that will try to tell me im not a 'real' fan because I don't like Load has no idea how many hours i've spent listening to this great band.  Im not using the whole 'selling out' thing as an excuse not to like this album either.  I have listened to Load many times trying to give it a chance; I wanted to like this, but it just wasn't there.  Aint (...) is the only reason that I even still have Load, and even then I only end up putting it in every once in a long while.
B000286S8S|1.0|The only people who will like this are the people that did not buy the 'Best of' Album.  The people that already own the 'Best of' Album can only wonder why Van Halen have released this.  I therefore find this album totally unnecassary and disappointing.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is truly one of the best CDs I've heard in  years.  Buy it and appreciate it as a great work from a great band and don't try to compare it to other bands.
B00005NVDF|5.0|Adapted from the play of the same name, done by Woody Allen (which also starred Diane Keaton), this is the movie version. <br /> <br />This was Keaton's first of many movies with Woody Allen, and it's a great one. <br /> <br />Woody Allen's character, named Allen, has just broken up with his girlfriend, now two of his friends (who are married) are trying to find Allen a date. <br /> <br />With true nervous Woody Allen style, going on dates and trying to find a new girlfriend is torture for him.   <br /> <br />Some great scenes include Woody Allen getting prepared before a date in the bathroom;  Woody describing what happened to him last night (when he had got in a fight at a bar) <br /> <br />There's one more thing I should mention about this movie:  Allen is a huge fan of Humphrey Bogart, especially in Casablanca.  And wouldn't you know it that Allen has hallucionations of Bogart talking to him.  Poor Woody
0679745653|4.0|Through the narrations of a young man, we learn about the life of a wildly popular socialite named Holly Golighty in Truman Capote's story, Breakfast at Tiffany's.  He tells us of Holly's trouble with life and encounters with past husbands and sneaky drug lords.  While on the streets of New York City, we become captivated by the realistic sense of the whole book, which pulls us in further to keep on reading and leaves us wanting more at the end.<br /><br />Holly Golighty isn't just another shallow playgirl.  She is well created, another great aspect of this book, and is well evolved.  She begins her life as Lulumae, a young, hillbilly girl found rummaging through an older man's garbage, who later becomes her dearly beloved.  She learns that she doesn't want a country lifestyle and moves on, to New York City, and becomes very popular.  While in the city, she also learns that she doesn't like to hang around when things begin to dull or if there is a pause in the action.  A major theme I found in Breakfast at Tiffany's is how Holly's character changes.  Starting as Lulumae, she progresses to become Holly, and then moves out of the country, to begin a new life as a new person.  Although Holly was a great character, I didn't like how she would leave her problems behind her, without trying to fix them first.  For instance, once she was falsely accused of helping a drug lord communicate instructions from jail, she decided to leave the country instead of proving her innocence and telling the truth.  I found this to be childish but it does add to the character, so it didn't bother me too much.<br /><br />Because Breakfast at Tiffany's is an easy read, I found it to be even more enjoyable than it already is.  I thoroughly liked reading this book.
B00024BHTC|2.0|The musicianship is different, but I just cannot get into this at all.  Sometimes these bands can just go to far with the Opera influence and the music starts to sound fascicle.  I prefer listening to classic garage rock like 'the Darkness'.

But a confrontation with the locals on Endor, furry creatures called Ewoks, is ineffidible. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, feeling he's jeopardizing the mission, Luke confronts Vader, and is taken abourd the Death Star, where the Emporer awaits. <br /> <br />\\"Soon the rebellion will be crushed, and young Skywalker will be one of us\\" <br /> <br />The long-awaited Star Wars Trilogy is finally making it's way on DVD, it should have happened a long time ago.  Oh well. <br /> <br />And yes, these will be the 'Special Edition' copies of the films, and there's nothing we can do about it.  I'm okay with it, but many others are not. <br /> <br />We can only hope that the fourth disc with the special features will be cool.  Sure to have information on Episode III, but I won't be checking that out until after I see that movie next year.  I already have enough assumptions in my head about what will happen in that movie, I want to be surprised. <br /> <br />This DVD set will probably be one of the most best-selling DVDs around, that and probably Episode III:  Revenge of the Sith.
B0002IQHY8|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the worst cds ever made - and from an artist who is usually one of my favorites! This cd is just plain embarrassing from start to finish. I actually winced in pain during the worst parts of it. Just thinking about it makes me mad. The title is ironic because Alan Parsons WAS just recently on A VALID PATH with the creation of On Air & The Time Machine, but not anymore. This new cd is just electroGARBAGE aimed at the Moby/Chemical Brothers/Crystal Method crowd...my sister likes that stuff, I HATE that stuff! Worse than the electronica stuff is the 2 pathetic attempts at alternative rock. MORE LOST WITHOUT YOU sounds like the kind of lame alt song that would play over the end of a chessy teen romance flick staring Hillary Duff. YOU CAN RUN is even worse, with Parsons trying to sound tough with a horrible Limp Bizkit meets Nine Inch Nails riff. I want to make three predictions 1) This cd will totally bomb with its intended younger audience. 2) It will end up in the bargain bins at the local K-Mart within a year. 3) The next Alan Parsons cd will attempt to jump on the garage rock bandwagon of the White Stripes, the Hives, and the Strokes. Once a great musician sells out there is nothing they won't do for a hit.
B000005IU2|5.0|two chords, three chords, 4/4, 3/4, who cares!  There have been moments listening to rock music that I will alway remember.  Putting led zeppelin 4 on my dad's turn table when i was younger and being blown away by that.  The First time i heard \\"My War\\" and or Black Flag in 1985 at my friends and finally hearing The Stooges Fun House album.  Anybody that tells you that Raw Power or the first album is better should be shot for treason, or is just a moron.  It's not even close.  I love the other two albums, but combinded they don't even touch the fun house album.  This is rock n' roll after rock n roll started to die.  How it should be done.  All killer, no filler.  The only thing that sucks is that it only has seven songs.  This is the sexiest album ever made.  If the bass at the begining of the song \\"Fun House\\" doesn't make you want to get up and strust like jagger in his prime, or put on some denim or a leather coat then you aren't human and you don't like music.  It's a real dirty gritty album.  Even the Stones couldn't touch this in their most herion drenched days.  Primal balls to the wall rock n roll.  All I can say is stop reading what the glossy magazines say when they do their lists of best iggy pop/stooges albums.  The best stooges record and iggy pop record is fun house.  And if you don't agree it's cause you suck and don't lik real rock n roll.  yeah!
B00005JMX6|3.0|This was an okay movie, i guess.  The sex appeal is obviously what drives it.   <br /> <br />The story of an ex-porn star who moves next door to some nerd.   <br /> <br />This guy's infacuation over her is the heart of the story, and so is his lack of experience.  His two friends (who are even more geekier than him) are quite pathetic.  But that one who watches the pornos is headed in the right direction. <br /> <br />There's no kidding that the girl from next door is hot, and it was enough to make me buy the movie (especially calling it the 'unrated' edition).  But, it's not a movie I would watch over and over again, maybe just certain scenes. <br /> <br />
B000002HAJ|5.0|The Cure - Wish (1992)<br /><br />WISH brings the eclecticism of KISS ME, KISS ME, KISS ME but pushes the emotions to radical extremes. Robert Smith's lyrics are more straightforward than ever before, using a style which will eventually burden some of his later work (IMHO). But it serves him well on WISH and the songs cut deeply. Some (\\"Open,\\" \\"End,\\" \\"Cut,\\" \\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\") are easily among the heaviest songs in the Cure catalogue. Probably the best line-up of Cures ever (and they were great live on this tour - Washington D.C.,'94). Like many of my favorite albums, WISH tells a story from beginning to end - your imagination permitting!).<br /><br />The breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Open\\" - a nightmarish account of what could be a typical weekend night for a typical anti-social angst-ridden Cure fan. Sounds like an acid trip that becomes painfully introspective. Powerful stuff. *****<br /><br />\\"High\\" - This exuberant slice of heaven is a radical departure from the previous track. One of the happiest songs from the Cure or anyone else. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Apart\\" - plunging once again into the depths of despair, this morose song chronicles the singer's disillusionment as the feelings about his relationship unravel. A beauty, the rhythm section is superb and Smith delivers one of his best guitar solos ever. *****<br /><br />\\"From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea\\" - The star-crossed lovers of \\"Apart\\" take doses. The music is swirling and churning, the lyrics are surreal and the singing full of despair. Smith explores one of his major recurring themes, the futility of quenching desires. It's about longing for an eternal love that can't exist. They pine for the impossible: to live in a moment forever. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Wendy Time\\" - Smith rejects another girl and further explores his feelings of detachment. Conversely, the tune is upbeat and playful. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Doing the Unstuck\\" - This song represents a fantastic triumph over the drudgery of life. I find it truly inspiring. *****<br /><br />\\"Friday I'm in Love\\" - is an irresistible pop masterpiece even though it tritely recites the days of the week.

B00028HBL6|1.0|I read the book first, and hated it.  The movie was even worse.
B0001906O0|4.0|That's right, I contend that the slow homoginization of the Cure sound which became somewhat of a formula is on display over the course of these 4 disks. Obviously a must for Cure fans, JOIN THE DOTS still boasts many fantastic, unusual songs that will surely win over new listeners as well.<br /><br />I got turned on to the Cure way back when THE HEAD ON THE DOOR came out and I gotta say their 80's material on Disk 1 still sounds fresh to me while the songs on disks 3 and 4 reveal the Cure becoming a bit more transparent and less surprising. I think their last truly great album was WISH, although that's when this intangible sort of change (or \\"sameness\\") began to creep in.<br /><br />Some will call me crazy as there is still a fair amount of diversity on the last 3 Cure albums as well as disks 3 and 4 of JOIN THE DOTS. So maybe I'm just saying the Cure have gotten a bit more predictable in later years. I'm tempted to rate this collection 5 stars on the strength of Disk 1 which contains some of the most unusual and entertaining Cure songs ever, but I'm trying to remain objective here.<br /><br />I could go on and on about these songs and the memories they invoke, especially the ones on disks 1 and 2, so I'll refrain from doing so. I'm sure many Cure fans would list a number of songs they think should have been added to this set. I'll just say that I would've omitted \\"How Beautiful You Are\\" from disk 2 since it's practically identical to the album version. In its place I would've added the \\"Primary (Red Mix)\\" alongside the \\"Just Like Heaven (Dizzy Mix).\\" I think \\"Primary\\" is one of the Cure's weaker singles, but this remix is tripped-out and totally hot.<br /><br />I don't want to indicate disks 3 and 4 are lame by any means - I can't say I love all of these songs, but there is still much to like here. The \\"Purple Haze\\" covers are way cool and, contrary to the opinion of some goofy reviewer here, the \\"A Forest\\" remix with Earl Slick is powerful and super tripped out - it totally KILLS (ignore trendy critics who get hung up on the \\"dated\\" drum&bass sound). And I love the beautiful orchestral version of \\"This is a Lie\\" - the lyrics are so poignant and express something so true about how people believe in false religions and other misguided ways of life just because they were brought up that way.<br /><br />The best songs in this collection (more than half) demonstrate the Cure's ability to paint a vivid musical picture that perfectly compliments any given feeling or subject matter in a song. That is characteristic of the music I love the most.dy critics who get hung up on the \\"dated\\" drum&bass sound).

B000002HPV|5.0|Understated/overstated beats rhythems and voices transend all music, as Bjork takes on her Homogenic Journey. I have had this CD since it first came out and was always obsessed with Joga. I remember listening to the album from its start to its final beat without ever losing touch with my emotions. She moves me with every scream and every synthetic beat. What an amazing CD. She will always be the most creative musical force of her time. The anti-pop princess reigns.
B000003BZ4|4.0|From the opening track, with Warren's eerie vocals, until the closing note, with Mule's full assault, you'll again know that 3 men can make such powerful music with little to no overdubs, the way the Who, Cream and Jimi used to do it.  The playing is tight and the bass is a revelation, cutting through the passive style that is too common in contemporary music.  The album rambles at times, but just when you think it's getting dull, the next track grabs you and doesn't let go.  These guys can flat out play and they don't care if ever have a video on MTV.  Music for the sake of music...You've gotta love it.

Steven, right now, tonight, your young again, your just breezing through time, choose the things youll be proud of, the things that last. When Steven Spielberg wishes upon a mirror vision star, if you believe, then I believe, when you wish upon a mirror vision star, makes no difference who you are, any mirror vision that you dream, will come to drew, if you heart is in your mirror vision, no request is too extreme, anything you heart desires, will come to drew, like a bolt out of the blue, mirror vision steps in and sees you thru, timeline-Monday, Sept. 6th, 2004, presented at 8:30 to 10:30 p.m., Garry and Steven were here, and watched Pinocchio in mirror vision for the first time in history, history was made, and little stevens wish came true, goodnight steven my friend, love garry hixon and hello to drew barrymore
B0002O06N0|5.0|What if Queens of the Stone Age ditched the bombast? What if White Stripes ever discovered that long missing testosterone hormone? Neither would have made a better record the Black Keys' Rubber Factory, hands down the rock album of the year. Yup it's two of them and they're a black to Jack's White and both bands love the blues, but there the similarites end. Not content with impressive pastiche like the Stripes, or cheekiness like the Blues Explosion, the Keys head past the blues for blistering riff-rock. Like the new garage rockers, the sound is vital and sharp. Unlike the garage rockers, it has buckets of soul, sin and sex. It helps that singer Dan Auerbach has the best voice in rock. It also helps that drummer Patrick Carney has been studying his Wu-tang records instead Led Zeppelin's. Even more remarkable, the Black Keys may have made the first garage rock record relevant to their own generation. In the past, sloppy production blunted their attack, but here the crispness sharpens their sound and fury. This is what rock and roll's beating heart sounds like.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Needs no sell.  Greatest cultural event of the 80's - nay, the latter part of the 20th century.  Great cause, historic musical meeting of the minds, bodies, and souls, and a derring-do, history-making flight itinerary flown by none other than Mr. Phil Collins!!  I hope Band-Aid is included; it would be a crime to leave it out absent a release of its own seperate DVD.

Look, the message basically boils down to \\"follow your dreams to find who you are.\\"  That's a fortune from a cookie, not a novel!  You get that free after your $4.95 lunch special!  I realize that I sound churlish, but let's be specific: the characters (such as they are) have no clear personality, the prose is repetitive and there is basically no plot.  Save your time and order in Chinese Food.

B0002IQHZM|5.0|Donovan really delivers on the promise of a \\"smoky\\" Beatnick Cafe atmosphere on ALL tracks.  There are no typical Beatnick cliches, just super kewl stand-up bass/drums matching his hipster guitar and vocal style, with splashes of vibes and keyboard.  In my opinion, Donovan finally got it right: an entire CD of well-written and performed songs.  Fire up your \\"incense,\\" turn your lights down low and let this artful CD transport you to the Universal Beat Cafe. <br />
B00006M183|4.0|This album is a gem! <br />Pearl Jam have once again proved that they are still at their best. THis album matches that of Vitalogy and if I could, I would give it 4.5 stars. The best song on this album is 'Love boat Captain' by far. <br /> <br />If you are a Pearl jam fan you won't be disapointed. If you are new to Pearl Jam you should get 'Ten' or 'Vs.'
0393035158|4.0|The End of Faith is, in most respects, a masterful performance.  Anyone who wants to understand the dangers of unjustified belief should read this book.   Harris reveals how preposterous our current situation in the world is--while religious lunatics fly planes into our buildings and plot further atrocities, we waste our resources on faith-based projects like the drug war and a gay-marriage ammendment.  The one issue I take with the book (and the reason why I gave it only four stars) is that the author doesn't spend nearly enough time discussing the way fundamentalist Christian concerns about biblical prophecy have influenced our policy with respect to Israel and pose a current danger to the world.  Harris talks about this in passing, but if you really want to understand this issue you have to read The End of Days by G. Gorenberg (which Harris cites).  Still, The End of Faith is must reading on Islam, on the nature of belief itself, and on the rational alternatives to religious faith.
B00004T8RK|3.0|This album isn't a patch on any other Pearl Jam album.Pearl Jam can do better.I'd reccomend any other Pearl Jam album instead of this.

They have a similar sound but are 10 times better. <br />Yield is the better of the two.

B000002JNJ|5.0|Cowboys From Hell(1990). Pantera's breakthrough album (though not the official debut because they had several glam albums in the 80s that the band completely disregards).    Back in the 1980s, Pantera was a completely unknown and different band than the one we know now. They started off as a glam metal act along the likes of Poison and Motley Crue, and released four albums which earned them no success and are now out of print. At the time, only drummer Vinnie Paul, bassist Rex Rocker, and guitarist Diamond \\"Dimebag\\" Darrel were in the band. It wasn't until their fourth album that current vocalist Phil Anselmo joined. After making the four glam metal albums without gaining any sort of fame, Pantera decided to pull all the stops and make a complete 180 degree turn on the band's sound and image. Gone were the happy songs about partying and the big hair, and in came the dirty, heavy thrash mayhem that measures up to the likes of older Metallica and Testament. And in 1990, the band pressed forth with their fifth album, Cowboys From Hell and never looked back. This ended up being their riskiest yet smartest move and Pantera instantly met with great success. The band now regards CFH as their first album and refuses to admit that they were once a fully-fledged hair metal band. I've even heard of cases where fans would bring that subject to their attention and the band would attack their fans for even mentioning their past! Yikes.    Nevertheless, CFH is an astounding thrash metal assault and as it stands, a masterpiece. I first picked it up last year when I had the choice of purchasing either this album and Testament's New Order or the then-new St. Anger album by Metallica. Needless to say, I'm EXTREMELY glad I went with the former choice. Phil's singing is at his best on this album, seeing that he was able to hit some blazing high notes before his voice started having problems between this album and the next. \\"Dimebag\\" proves right away that he is an absolutely amazing shredder on here in both the rhythm sections and the solos. While CFH is clearly a thrash metal album, you can definitely see how this band was once a glam metal act, especially in some of the song structures. However, it's all done with some of the heaviest guitar distortions, so the songs on here can best be described as \\"brutally heavy, but fun\\". In a way it acts as Pantera's transitional album from the older glammy style to the intensely powerful all-out thrash of Vulgar Display Of Power(1992). Other songs are clearly influenced by 80s thrash metal and prove that the band has quite a bit of versatility between the songs. To this day I find CFH to be their best album and future releases would demonstrate to be gradually lesser in quality as time went on.    Onto the songs... The title track sets the pace for the album and kicks things off perfectly, introducing you to the band's in-your-face brand of heavy metal. That, 'Psycho Holiday', and 'Clash With Reality' have the stand-out anthemic party quality that the band might have previously done in the 80s. Then you've got some real shredding scorchers such as the brief machine gun totting 'Primal Concrete Sludge', the Metallica-esque 'Heresey' and 'Domination', and the Judas Priest-on-steroids 'Shattered'. The best track on the disc though has to be the mega-epic thrash ballad and my favorite Pantera song 'Cemetary Gates'. This one doom/gloom ballad is done incredibly well and easily compares to the likes of Metallica's 'Fade To Black', 'Welcome Home Sanitarium' and 'One'. It shows that Phil can do a great job singing in a low-key melodic tone. Other tracks include the pulse-pounding 'Art Of Shredding', the melodic and haunting 'Medicine Man', and the gloomy rocker 'Message In Blood'. The only track that doesn't stand out as much is 'Sleep', which is not bad at all, just forgettable.    Highlights: 'Cowboys From Hell', 'Psycho Holiday', 'Cemetary Gates', and 'Medicine Man'    Overall, CFH is an album that all thrash metal lovers need to own. With as many great songs and skilled musicianship that it has, it's no wonder I'm giving the album 5 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL METAL FANS.    Other similar albums:  -'Vulgar Display Of Power' by Pantera  -'Master Of Puppets' by Metallica  -'Legacy' by Testament  -'Dead Heart In A Dead World' by Nevermore
B00005JMAH|4.0|The books are getting so big now the movies have all the necessary scenes squashed together. Not everything was given the amount of time that it so desperately needed to get the magical atmosphere the first two movies had. The first two books were great, and not that I am complaining about the amount of pages the last two books had, but the movies are going to have to be a two part movie if they want everything in it.  <br /> <br />The good things about this movie is of course the special effects and scenery. The castle is still its good old self of magic and mystery, lots of hall scenes and moving staircases are shown in this one. And even Hagrids hut is shown, but have you seen its new location? Theres all these rocks in front of it and the hill looks like it will kill you if you took a wrong step. <br /> <br />The acting is good and Hermoine is a lot better than what she was in the last two movies. [The entire crowd exploded in applause when whe punched Malfoy.]Ron and Harry are good, but Professor Lupin was the real big surprise in this one. His face wasn't what I saw when I read the books, but I got over it after several minutes.  <br /> <br />The bad things are that there is no scenes with professor McGonnagal. Oh sure we see her for about two minutes, but that is not enough if you ask me. You can agree or disagree. And what has happened with all these scene changings? Half of the most important scenes are all twisted and shaped into these confusing and sort of dumb new ideas.  <br /> <br />And what really ticked me off was there was no Quidditch matches AT ALL. There is about thirty seconds of scene when Harry fell off his broom, but other than that nothing. Come on! I also didn't like the rushed scene at the shrieking shack when Harry learns the truth about Sirius. And the fact that the big scene with the Patronus is just a big flash of light sucked also. Not nearly as good as it could have been. <br /> <br />All in all, the director should be given his dues, this is a really hard movie to direct and I enjoyed most of what he did. But if the next one is still just one movie wrapped up in three or four hours, then I'll wait to rent it when it comes out on DVD.
B0002DB52M|1.0|...it would take it out and play wif it. After quickly discovering that this movie isn't a movie at all, I removed it from my dvd player and placed it back in it's case. I then stuck my finger down my throat and up-chucked directly on the disc itself. Afterwards I closed the case and stuck it in my shed. I can only hope that the acids from my own vomit will melt down the plastic so that it's made unwatchable, because it's unwatchable regardless. DOGVILLE isn't for your everyday movie fan, it's for those who like to call the everyday movie fan like me close minded... Gosh I wish I was as smart as you so I could enjoy movies of such a high caliber.
6304711891|5.0|The Rock is a great masterpeice that takes place on Alcatraz Island, next to San Francisco. A number of ex marines, led by Frank Hummel, played by Ed Harris, have taken control of 80 plus hostages on Alcatraz Island and threaten to launch guided missles armed with poison gas. Not only does the homeland security want to save as many hostages as possible, but each rocket can kill up to 75,000 people each.  <br /> <br />Since all the wardens and guards have been dead for some time now the only person the good guys can turn to is the only man who secretly escaped Alcatraz years ago. That man would be John Mason, played by the great Sean Connery, who was locked away to be forgotten after learning all the white house's dirty little secrets of the past half century. <br /> <br />After several detours, an escape and a car chase, Mason agrees to work with the fake promise of freedom. He teams up with a nerdy chemical weapons specialist, played by Nicholas Cage, and a group of Navy Seals. Once inside the rock everything goes wrong and in the end only Mason and Goodspeed [Cage] are left alive to try and save San Francisco.  <br /> <br />This movie is off the page from beginning to end, which is really hard to do nowadays, and the music is just awesome. Connery, Cage, and Ed Harris [who plays the marine general] all shine in their own moments throughout the entire movie. The action scenes are great, lots of deaf-defying maneuvers, which occur on the top of a lighthouse, and below the island itself on an abandoned coal mining track.  <br /> <br />The marines even turn on each other at the end which leads to the shocking conclusion at the very end, if you haven't seen it yet I wont ruin it. Connery is the one who really shines and proves it in an absolutely breathtaking scene when he rolls under a buring furnace to unlock a door from the other side.  <br /> <br />This is truly a masterpeice to suspension and action. Lots of other small characters help out to support the main actors and the ending is truly great. This is a must have for any fan of great action and great acting.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I have no problem with Lucas making changes and adding footage, but he knows there are purists out there that want the original.  I would like the originals remastered WITHOUT adding the crap in.  We don't need dancing Ewoks!   <br /> <br />Spielberg made changes to ET, but included the original remastered in the set.  Lucas could have done the same.   <br /> <br />Star Wars is a cultural phenomenom.  Lucas knows the fanatics out there are salivating over the DVD set.  He could have made everybody happy by remastering the originals without the crap, but he didn't. <br /> <br />Scumbag move.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|Wow. What else can you say? Unearth rips back into the metalcore scene with this display that shows how metal should be. They fixed their crappy production, which definitly brought the strings of conscience down, and they started a new style for themselves, which obviously paid off big. I think this album is the true beggining to what will be an exellent band for many more cds to come. I also think that this cd is comparable to the pure incredibleness of KsE's Alive or just breathing. There are only two others that can take best metal album of the year, Lamb of God's Ashes of the wake and shadows fall's cd that will be released on september 21. So in conclusion, check this one out, I promise you will not be dissapointed, because no metal-head should not own this album.
B0002IQHY8|4.0|Alan Parsons gone techno, well not quite. Alot of the tracks, if not all of them feature dance/techno elements to them, but I think they still retain the signature Alan Parsons sound. I've read alot of reviews here really slating the album, but I think people forget that Prog Rock is meant to be different and progressive, frankly I would have been dissapointed with another On Air or Time Machine. Not that I don't like those albums, I think they are great, but he's been there and done all that stuff. Why stand still and not take a risk trying something new. I don't think you can call that selling out! Ok I know not everyone likes the techno dance scene, but not everyone can be pleased. <br /> <br />It does take a few listens to get into the album, at first I wasn't too sure, but on repeated listens, I found the album had more and more to offer. <br /> <br />One gripe I do have is the reworks of Mammagamma and A Dream within a Dream/The Raven. I really don't see the point, the new versions add nothing to the originals and much prefer them in their own context. <br /> <br />I think this album is really good so give it ago, you might like it.
B0000CFW87|5.0|josh grobans second cd - closer is even better than the first (and thats saying A LOT). his voice has improved and matured since the last cd, and the songs have more depth and feeling.  my favourite track is mi mancherai, it has beautiful violin and his voice is PERFECT. if you ever have the chance to see him live i strongly recommend it, hes ten times better in concert and puts on a WONDERFUL show.
0393035158|5.0|Those that oppose Mr. Harris' book, \\"The End of Faith,\\" as religion-bashing are unwittingly conceding his point -- the so-called \\"good\\" religionists have to depart from scripture in order to participate as rational beings within the human race. <br /> <br />If only these beneficent, free-thinking readers of scripture had any influence among the other members of their respective faiths. That is because nowhere in the Koran or Bible does it say \\"Well, some of these verses are the word of God, and some aren't...\\" <br /> <br />Harris' point is that those who believe in enjoying a truly spiritual life have to rise up against those whose blind obsession with a perceived afterlife vitiates any consideration or understanding of those who want to make life in the present better and less dangerous. <br /> <br />The author is calling a spade a spade. When people of faith have modern weapons, it's open season on us all. You can neither trust, or reason with, the Muslim who dreams of martyrdom and the company of virgins in the afterlife than you can trust or reason with Christian who looks forward to the Rapture. <br /> <br />The forces of unreason are like matter and antimatter. They are eventually going to collide and extinguish the planet.
B00028HBKC|5.0|have we seen a movie with such detail about what our Lord went through so that we may have the opportunity to be saved. The movie itself from what I can tell is for the most part based on three sources; The Bible, The Dolorous Passion, and Mel Gibson's creative side. I highly ask you to purchase the guide with the movie if you aren't familiar with the life of Jesus, stations of the Cross, etc.
B00004TL21|5.0|After the 1997 masterpiece, \\"Around the Fur\\", the Deftones continued to incorporate heavy layers of mood and atmosphere into their music, inspired by bands such as The Cure. The result was \\"White Pony\\", which was hailed by critics as one of the best albums of the year upon its release in June of 2000.  <br /> <br />\\"Feiticeira\\" opens the album on a heavy note. The song is fast paced and unpredictable, containing numerous tempo changes as lead singer Chino Moreno puts himself in a fictitious kidnapping scenario. <br /> <br />\\"Digital Bath\\" is another tune in which Chino creates an eerie scenario for the song (electrocuting a woman in a bathtub), but the morbid lyrics are masked by his amazing vocal delivery. The seductive, ethereal verses are the perfect lead in for the soaring, spine-tingling chorus.  <br /> <br />\\"Elite\\" is probably the heaviest Deftones song ever; a brutal onslaught of unrelenting neo-industrial/metal guitar riffs and insane vocals from Chino - he literally screams his way through the whole thing. It'll seem un-listenable at first, but give it time to grow. I couldn't stand it at first, but now it's one of my favorites (I even quoted a part of it in my title). <br /> <br />On the opposite side of the spectrum is \\"Teenager\\", the most intimate, beautiful Deftones song ever. The electronica/trip-hop beat is the perfect backdrop for Chino's gorgeous vocals.  <br /> <br />Speaking of amazing vocal performances, check out Rodleen in the background of \\"Knife Prty\\". Think Claire Tory from Pink Floyd's \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", but scary. It's amazing that someone can *shriek* high notes like that. The song itself is great too, one of the most haunting, mysterious tunes on an album full of haunting, mysterious tunes.  <br /> <br />The heavy, carnal \\"Korea\\" is probably my favorite song on the album - a wonderful blend of crunching guitar riffs, enigmatic lyrics, and an awe-inspiring bridge that soars majestically amongst its power and aggression. <br /> <br />\\"Passenger\\", in which Chino trades off vocals with Tool/A Perfect Circle front man Maynard James Keenan is another awe-inspiring song that layers metal-like guitars over an atmospheric backdrop. <br /> <br />\\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\" is easily the most accessible song on here, and its video even earned the Deftones a slot on MTV's TRL for a few days. It fits the mood of the album perfectly though - slow creeping, spooky verses lead into the heavy-but-catchy chorus, and an even catchier bridge. <br /> <br />\\"Pink Maggit\\" closes the album in a perfect way. An 8 minute epic that goes from minimalistic and eerie to upbeat and anthematic. The latter part of the song was heavily reprised in \\"Back To School (Mini Maggit)\\", the second single which was tacked onto the beginning of a re-release. It's a decent nu-metal style song, but this is the true version of the album.  <br /> <br />Other standouts include the hypnotic, sexy groove of \\"Rx Queen\\" and the straightforward, catchy \\"Street Carp\\".  <br /> <br />Although I slightly prefer \\"Around the Fur\\" and their most recent self-titled album, \\"White Pony\\" is definitely the Deftones' best effort in terms of incorporating mood into their music. Everything on here is haunting, mysterious, etc., whether it be the music, lyrics, or in many cases, both. It's also the most accessible Deftones album overall, as it contains a bunch of really strong hooks amongst all the experimenting.  <br /> <br />Highest Recommendation. <br /> <br />Best Songs: Korea, Elite, Teenager, Pink Maggit, Passenger, Digital Bath. <br />
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris has written an extraordinary book giving voice to the idea that what confronts us in the \\"war on terror\\" and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are the dangers brought on by the proponents of absolutist dogma and faith. Harris argues that we must become aware of the dangers of religion breeding conflict in a nuclear world. The book traces the historical record of human suffering, genocide, wars and abuses brought on, not only by religious extremists fighting in the name of God, but by religious moderates who tolerate such thinking. The terrorist's battlefield is not based in Iraq, Afghanistan or the Middle East but in the cloistered worldview of individuals who threaten the modern world with today's terrible array of weapons in the guise of serving God.  <br />Mr. Harris's book should be seen as an opening salvo in the battle of reason over faith. We must begin a dialogue that questions whether religious faith is the problem not the solution to ridding ourselves of the scourge of terror. The separation of church and state is being eroded as organized religions influence modern world politics in hotspots all over the globe. This book is a must read for everyone who wants to fight the war on terror not with slogans and ideology but with tolerance, reason and open inquiry.  <br />Many people will decry this book as an assault against morality and ethics but it is only by replacing religious dogma with rational inquiry that we can embrace human diversity and promote tolerance in culture and ideas. As long as we place \\"reason in exile\\" and pit one God against another, we may expect the war on terror and human suffering to grow exponentially. <br />
B00004Z400|5.0|In October of 2000, \\"White Pony\\" was re-released with an extra track, that being the second single, \\"Back to School (Mini Maggit)\\". The song was record company dictated, and while it's not bad by any means, I prefer the original version without it. The nu-metal style rapping feels out of place on here..and the chorus is just taken from the far superior \\"Pink Maggit\\".  <br /> <br />There's certainly no harm in buying this version though..after all, you might really like the song. And even if you don't, you can always skip over it and go directly to the intended opening song, \\"Feiticeria\\" - a heavy, fast-paced song with numerous tempo changes. <br /> <br />\\"Digital Bath\\" is one of many tunes in which Chino creates a ficticious, eerie scenario for the lyrics (in this case, electrocuting a woman in a bathtub). The morbid lyrics are masked by his amazing vocal delivery. The seductive, ethereal verses are the perfect lead in for the soaring, spine-tingling chorus.  <br /> <br />\\"Elite\\" is probably the heaviest Deftones song ever; a brutal onslaught of unrelenting neo-industrial/metal guitar riffs and insane vocals from Chino - he literally screams his way through the whole thing. It'll seem un-listenable at first, but give it time to grow. I couldn't stand it at first, but now it's one of my favorites. <br /> <br />On the opposite side of the spectrum is \\"Teenager\\", the most intimate, beautiful Deftones song ever. The electronica/trip-hop beat is the perfect backdrop for Chino's gorgeous vocals.  <br /> <br />Speaking of amazing vocal performances, check out Rodleen in the background of \\"Knife Prty\\". Think Claire Tory from Pink Floyd's \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", but scary. It's amazing that someone can *shriek* high notes like that. The song itself is great too, one of the most haunting, mysterious tunes on an album full of haunting, mysterious tunes.  <br /> <br />The heavy, carnal \\"Korea\\" is probably my favorite song on the album - a wonderful blend of crunching guitarriffs, enigmatic lyrics, and an awe-inspiring bridge that soars majestically amongst its power and aggression. <br /> <br />\\"Passenger\\", in which Chino trades off vocals with Tool/A Perfect Circle front man Maynard James Keenan is another awe-inspiring song that layers metal-like guitars over an atmospheric backdrop. <br /> <br />\\"Change (In the House of Flies)\\" is easily the most accessible song on here, and its video even earned the Deftones a slot on MTV's TRL for a few days. It fits the mood of the album perfectly though - slow creeping, spooky verses lead into the heavy-but-catchy chorus, and an even catchier bridge. <br /> <br />\\"Pink Maggit\\" closes the album in a perfect way. An 8 minute epic that goes from minimalistic and eerie to upbeat and anthematic. The latter part will feel like a reprise of \\"Back to School\\", as this is where that song spawned from.  <br /> <br />Other standouts include the hypnotic, sexy groove of \\"Rx Queen\\" and the straightforward, catchy \\"Street Carp\\".  <br /> <br />Although I slightly prefer \\"Around the Fur\\" and their most recent self-titled album, \\"White Pony\\" is definitely the Deftones' best effort in terms of incorporating mood into their music. Everything on here is haunting, mysterious, etc., whether it be the music, lyrics, or in many cases, both. It's also the most accessible Deftones album overall, as it contains a bunch of really strong hooks amongst all the experimenting.  <br /> <br />Highest Recommendation. <br /> <br />Best Songs: Korea, Elite, Teenager, Pink Maggit, Passenger, Digital Bath. <br />
0790737302|5.0|The City of Angels movie makes you think, and wonder, and rejoice, and believe that if so many people in the world believe in religion, in an afterlife - if the concept is so pervasive, that maybe there is some truth to it.  <br />This movie came out right after my grandfather died, and as an over-thirty, experienced person who had watched him suffer through this wasted time brought on by age, I expected to be happy he was released when he died, but I was not.  <br />Maybe it was the fact that the nurse gave this 85 year old man who had not had solid food in a year a huge Potassium pill and left after he said that no, he didn't want any water, just to watch him code four minutes later. Maybe I just wasn't ready for him to be gone less than 12 hours after I'd taken him to the hospital. Maybe I just wasn't ready to be done loving him and changing his diapers and fighting with Grandma to not treat him like he had a choice. Maybe it was just that he was the most important man I've ever known. But I wasn't ready then, not at all, and this movie helped.  <br />It made me remember why we're here, to love, even when we know it will end in hurt.  <br />It made me allow myself to hope I'll see him again one day. <br />It made me accept that quality of life is not something that I should take for granted.  <br />But most of all, this movie let me think Gramps might still be around, looking over my shoulder, encouraging me to watch the traffic go by, appreciate my daughters teen years, get past Grandma's senile dementia, because he loved her even for all that she is.  <br />See the movie if you haven't, buy it for when you need to see it if you have. You won't regret it - everyone hits that point/realization about life, and death.  <br />As for comparing it to any other movie - don't bother.
B000002UE1|5.0|\\"Closer to Home\\", a 3rd album of this hard-rocking power trio from Michigan, marked a welcome change in their sound. I felt, its predecessor, known as The Red album, tried to be somewhat \\"progressive\\", while the band clearly had little idea of how to proper develop a long composition. This album shows Grand Funk doing what they do best, play loud and heavy straight in-your-face hard-rock with a strong blues-rock influence. Most of the songs are about 5 minutes or shorter, and the band keeps them dynamic and interesting. As usual, Mel Schacher's bass is superb, and Mark Farner's singing is top-notch, showing some traces of soul-music. The band shows its all during the 45 minutes of this recording. They play both loud and mellow, Farner provides good riffing and inserts some special guitar licks, drummer Don Brewer sings along with Mark or they exchange vocal lines on \\"Hooked on Love\\", while \\"Get It Together\\" features a female chorus backing vocals. Often the band turns solo parts into almost uncontrolled energetic studio jam, which sounds very good. <br /> <br />I'm glad that Mark, Don and Mel realized their strengths, stopped trying to write long developing compositions (they couldn't do it properly anyway), and instead put out strong hard rock songs, varying from the famous ballad \\"Mean Mistreater\\" to a faster \\"Nothing is the Same\\". This album is great to listen to. The only gripe I have concerns the closing 2 songs which both feature a 2-minute fade-out chorus repeat, which, to my mind, adds no value and could very well be cut out to maintain the dynamics. <br /> <br />Obviously, if you need only one CD by Grand Funk Railroad, this is the one.
0385493622|5.0|I read this book since I was so entertained by Singh's `Code Book'. <br /> <br />Fermat's Enigma is another excellent book of his.  Singh is a great writer and is one of the few that can take dry scientific subject and make them interesting. <br />
0345350499|5.0|Read it and find out for yourself. This book is about the wonderful womyn behind the once and future king's throne. I look to it's pages and find myself in a world of enchantment and magic. Let Vivianne, high priestess of Avalon and Morgaine touch your heart as they have touched mine. Incidently, though the film based on this book was lacking in many areas it is still a wonderfull and exciting journey.
0385495323|5.0|I was just on a 8-hour flight that turned into a 13-hour flight with delays. <br /> <br />I was able to read the Code Book in it entirely.  This is the only time I did not mind the delays, since it is such a interesting and captivating book. <br />
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Wow this CD is truly the Best recording of \\"duets\\" I have ever heard<br /><br />Ray Charges with Elton John is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in years. It is so moving , beyond discription<br /><br />Johnny Mathis & Ray Charles  excellant  ,  excellant<br /><br />& Ray Charles with Diane Kroll  Wow  Wow<br /><br />If this isn't Album of the year then I know these award shows are rigged.  I loved this CD indeed Ray Charles was a genious<br /><br />now he sings with the angels  How lucky can the HEAVENS Be !!!!<br /><br />Much Love
0393035158|5.0|One can not understate how important this book is.   <br />It is extremely well written and direly  <br />needed. I have wondered many a time, why this subject is never spoken of  <br />more openly.  Dogma and its power over the masses is really a frightening  <br />thing. One can only hope that others will have the courage to act at all levels of society and their institutions to encourage the   <br /> human race to evolve past this crippling  <br />state of affairs.  I enjoyed this book from cover to cover and cannot recommend it enough.  <br />  <br />
B0000057C5|5.0|I've been in German for 3 years now and I know enough that the \\"Du hast mich gefragt\\" isn't something you translate word for word, remember? the verb goes at the end but that isn't where it goes when it's translated it's really \\"You have asked me,\\" and \\"Und ich hab nichts gesagt\\" means \\"and I have said nothing.\\" Go back and review your sentence structures.  and the album is very kickass and the songs are even better live. I recommend buying the Live Aus Berlin DVD/VHS with this.  Oh, and btw, the R's are rolled because that's how they speak over there. Everybody rolls their R's in german.  You'll really love this album, it's definitely a must-buy if you're a fan of Rammstein.  The songs have a better complexion to them and though they still have that intoxicating rhythm to them that makes you just want to move to the music.  These guys are my favorite German band. You may want to consider buying some Knorkator CDs too, if I like them, you should like them, they are very comparable to a mix between Metallica and Rammstein, with the best aspects from both bands.  Enjoy!
0393035158|5.0|This book is an excellent analysis of how blind faith, based on irrational claims made by ignorant men thousands of years ago, is the core problem of our world, and indeed represents a real threat to the very future of civilization.  Fanatic true believers are focussed on death, martyrdom, and afterlife, and couldn't care less for this world, this time, this place.  And the unwillingness of so-called \\"tolerant, moderate\\" religious groups, let alone public discourse, to confront the direct link between blind faith and terrorism may be all of our downfall.  Harris shows persuasively that while religious moderates may imagine that respecting the unjustified and irrational beliefs of others is desirable and admirable, this very tolerance, minus critical and rational discussion, \\"is one of the principal forces driving us toward the abyss.\\"  A very provocative book, which I read with a feeling of relief that someone was finally talking sense!
0792844602|5.0|A unique anti-war film which satirizes the warrior class of nineteenth century England.  Harry wants to know why defending natives in far-off Africa is more important than taking care of the estate that was neglected because of his family's preoccupation with the glory of war.  He is not a coward, even though at times he seems to think that he is.  He surreptitiously saves the lives of those of his friends who marked him as a coward, and is, indeed, a hero when it is necessary to be a hero.  He differentiates between true heroics and the heroics worn only on the sleeve of much lesser men.  This is a good movie for today's political climate . . . it has as much to say about the arrogance of mindless warfare today as of the mindless warfare of over 100 years ago.
B00028HBKM|5.0|When watching this movie I had to ask myself, \\"Do I really have any problems?\\" Watching what Jesus went through makes my issues so small. The things we complain about in everyday life could not compare to the Cross that Jesus had to bear. <br /> <br />I am a Catholic and had no issues with Mel Gibson and this movie. It is a story that needed to be told from a different point of view, a view that was more reallstic. The Passion of the Christ was very graphic and that's what made it a superb movie. The movie touched me so that I have not watched it again since the first time I viewed it, because it made me take a hard look at myself. What I need to do more to be a peace with God and myself, not to say that I don't want to, it just seems like its so much work to do. I need to take heed to this movie and be more forgiving because what has been done to me is nothing like what has been done to Jesus. <br /> <br />While wrong was being done to him, he repeatedly asked his Father to forgive them because they know not what they do. That is deep, so deep because we are so quick to seek revenge on out enemies. <br /> <br />Please forget about the hype that is surrounding this movie, look past that and learn a valuable lesson. <br /> <br />Later....
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles gives us more reasons to hear why he's The Master in wondrous duets with Norah Jones, James Taylor and Van Morrison. His rendition, with Elton John, of \\"Sorry Seems to be The Hardest Word\\" is one of the best tracks. A must-have for ANY music lover....thanks for taking us along for a wonderful ride, Ray
1400034779|5.0|Surprise, Surprise. This is not a thriller as I expected but a book about life and human nature, filled with love for Africa and the African people. It seems that lately Africa has lost its \\"charm\\" in the western eyes and is now mostly related to AIDS, hunger and war. This book seems to give Africa its lost glory.  <br />Mma Ramotswe is a fat black African lady who decides, after her father's death, to open a detective agency. Mma Ramotswe is a unique lady. On the one hand she fits the description of the lonely detective operating by himself, relying on her wit (and her car's engine) only, but on the other hand she is a woman who loves human beings, gossip and secrets. Mma Ramotswe likes to summarize to herself the truth she learns about life. She enjoys little pleasures of life, such as drinking bush tea or watching cattle. She is, so I see her, a symbol of Africa herself. Precious Ramotswe had her share of grief but she is a person who grew up being loved and is thus ready to give something to the world.  <br />The book was a real pleasure. I felt it was literature of the \\"old fashioned kind\\" in the sense that this is the kind of book that takes you and teaches you of other places. You learn to see Africa through the eyes of Precious Ramotswe. You learn that not all Africans are the same (\\"Ghanaians were Mma Ramotswe's favourite people; they had a wonderful sense of humor and were almost inevitably in a good mood\\"). You see the landscape, the food, but most of all you learn about people, how they think and what they deem important. There are human traits that are similar everywhere; Mma Ramotswe has to deal with problems of cheating husbands, non-believing women and greed of many kinds. But she also has to deal with problems unique to this part of the world, such as witch craft and its dangers. Through the story of Mma Ramotswe life and the cases she needs to solve we learn not only of Africa today and its problems but also of the character of the African people.The cases are not the real essence of the story. They are merely a vehicle to tell us about life.  This is not the regular mystery story where one case is solved throughout the book. There are many small cases which are only the glue holding this lovely tale. <br /> <br />
0783225733|5.0|Hi there, <br /> <br />Just pointing out that Apollo 13 was actually shot using the Super 35 process, which utilises the FULL film frame (4:3 ratio) and the CROPS it to 1:2.35 for the cinema film print. This way the filmlmakers do not have to worry about their films being panned and scanned later on and sides of the image being lost. When watching the TV 4:3 version of Apollo 13 you are in fact seeing the entire film as it was shot.  <br />The cinematic release, still valid by the film makers (as they shoot with a 1:2.35 mask on the viewfinder so as to capture all the intended action in frame), is in fact a cropped version on the top and bottom; hence the widescreen DVD of this film is still exactly what you saw in the theatres, so don't worry - you have not been ripped off. All is well.
B0000025DT|5.0|This album probably deserves something around 11 stars. On a scale from 1 to 5. It's that good. It is ELO's best, in my opinion, by a hair over Face the Music and Out of the Blue. The album is just hit after hit after hit, each song a masterpiece on their own. It's amazing how 9 of the best songs by Jeff Lynne could be placed on 1 album.  <br /> <br />This was the first album I discovered by ELO. The first time I listened to Tightrope, it blew me away. It's worth for the money for that one song, but you also get the other 8, and your money is well spent on any single song on this album. <br /> <br />1) Tightrope: Enough said already. Starts with great string work, then moves into one of the best beats ever. <br /> <br />2) Telephone Line: Listen 1- Ok good song, Listen 2- Pretty good!, Listen 3- Oh my, this song is remarkable. Listen 4- Arguably one of the best songs ever. <br /> <br />3) Rockaria!: A mixture of rock and, well, an aria. Great mixture of rock and opera on this song. Who knew that opera singing could be used on an album like this? <br /> <br />4) Mission (A World Record): Outstanding. Can't say any more. <br /> <br />5) So Fine: I'm running out of things to say about there songs. I can't stress how much every song is AMAZING.  <br /> <br />6) Livin' Thing: Right about now on the album, you'll wonder how much better it can get. This song does not disappoint. Livin' Thing is one of the best on the album. <br /> <br />7) Above the Clouds: Probably the most overlooked song here. Only 2:16, but still great by itself, which I realized on my third listen to it.  <br /> <br />8) Do Ya: It is the best song ever in some respects. Every song here is. <br /> <br />9) Shangri-La: The album goes out with a bang. A most remarkable song. That's all I can say. <br /> <br />Buy this album. You need to.

B00007KWHP|5.0|Fragile, Yes's fourth album, is one of their best installments. It is the second album of guitarist Steve Howe, and the first of Rick Wakeman, their great keyboardist. Both of these unbelievable musicians, along with Jon Anderson's vocals, Chris Squire's bass, and Bill Bruford's drums, produce a great mixture of prog rock on this one album.  <br /> <br />Every song is great, from Roundabout to Heart of the Sunrise, from Cans and Brahms to Long Distance Runaround, from South Side of the Sky to Mood for a Day. A must own for every progressive rock fan. It is truly amazing.
B00001NFCY|5.0|After getting this CD a few years ago, it has remained one of my all time favorites. It has some of the old sounding Creed for the first few years and a taste of what was to come in Weathered. Here is a song by song review <br />1.Are You Ready(4/5)-A good start to the cd, but not the best. <br />2.What If?(5/5)-Tied for the hardest rocking song on the album, very cool  <br />3.Beautiful(3/5)-An OK song, a good chorus and ending. <br />4.Say I(4/5)-Kind of haunting, talks about a destroyed world or somthing. <br />5.Wrong Way(3/5)-This song never really caught my interest,OK <br />6.Faceless Man(5/5)-A very good song, I like how the drums come in and the ending is basically like all good Creed endings <br />7.Never Die(5/5)-Great <br />8.With Arms Wide Open(4/5)-The harder rock version of the song,the strings version is the radio one <br />9.Higher(5/5)-Creed will probably be remembered for this and With Arms Wide Open, great opening, great chorus, and overall great. <br />10.Wash Away Those Years(5/5)- My personal favorite on the album, it starts off slow then gets lounder until the climax where Scott's vocals really soar, listen you'll see what I mean. <br />11.Inside Us All(5/5)-A good closing for the regular cd, the chorus is really good and Mark singing in the back ground is great. <br />12.With Arms Wide Open[strings version](5/5)-The megahit, a very moving song with great everything and a symphony in the background. <br />So with that in mind, know Creed is definately one of the best bands out there if not the best, and that this is considered by many to be their best album. <br />
B0000033P2|5.0|Trilogy, the fourth album of Emerson, Lake and Palmer, is one of their best works. It even contains my favorite song of all time. With each listen, it gets better and better, and mind you, I've listened to it thousands of times. Here's how it goes:    1) The Endless Enigma, Part 1: You won;t like it at first. It's okay second time through. Third time, pretty good. After that, truly amazing.    2) Fugue, just a little Emerson ditty separating the previous song from...    3) The Endless Enigma, Part 2: A much shorter version of Part 1, but still great nonetheless.    4) From the Beginning: Greg Lake put out plenty of acoustic songs in ELP, and many were quite good. This is one. I had skipped over it for a long time, but then I had put it on, and I remember thinking 'Wow, this is pretty good!' And it is.    5) The Sheriff: Reminiscent of Jeremy Bender. Great, great song. I can't listen to it enough.    6) Hoedown: Taken from Rodeo, by Aaron Copland. A great rendition of the song you know from everywhere.    7) Trilogy: My favorite song of all time. It starts with piano and Lake, but moves into driving guitar, along with the Moog. It's the best.    8) Living Sin: An underrated song. The more you listen, the more it becomes a great little song.    9) Abaddon's Bolero: The longest song on the album, and the one many view as the worst. It may be, but I think it's great.    Buy this album if you appreciate Progressive Rock. It's money well spent.
B000066NW0|5.0|I say this album isn't as good as Under My Skin, but I still think she put out the best album she was able to do back then. <br />1. Losing Grip-This song is really cool, I love it. Great opening song. 10/10 <br />2.Complicated-The radio played this too much but it's still a good song. 9/10 <br />3.Sk8er Boi- I used to love this song, now it's still ok, but not my favorite. 9/10 <br />4.I'm With You- Such a great song. It's a heart-touching ballad. 10/10 <br />5.Mobile- Probably my least favorite track.8/10 <br />6.Unwanted- Avril's faovrite track. It's so cool. 10/10 <br />7.Tomorrow- LOVE IT! 10/10 <br />8.Anything But Ordinary-Yes, that's what you are Avril. 9/10 <br />9. Thing's I'll Never Say- This is an awesome song. 10/10 <br />10. My World- This is a great song to sing if you live in a small town. 9/10 <br />11.Nobody's Fool- I'm surprised, if Avril had wanted to, she would've been a pretty good rapper. 10/10 <br />12. Too Much To Ask- One of my favorites. 10/10 <br />13. Naked- Good closing to good album. 10/10 <br /> <br />126/130=5 stars <br /> <br />
B000002GQK|5.0|As the sixth installment in the Moody Blues repertoire, you'd think that they would have faded slightly in their creativity. On the contrary, many say that they peaked here. Although it holds only 9 songs, it is enough to be regarded as one of the best ever. I was hooked from the first note of Story in Your Eyes.    1) Procession: Just an intro. Possibly a little bit too long.    2) Story in Your Eyes: One of the best rock songs ever. Period.    3) Our Guessing Game: After a few listens, one will realize that this song is also a masterpiece. It truly is.    4) Emily's Song: Possibly the worst song on the album, but still great anyway.    5) After You Came: Another unbelievable song on this album. Great guitar work on this song.    6) One More Time to Live: Amazing. It brings back parts from procession, mixed into an outstanding song, which starts slow, and progressively gets faster.    7) Nice to be Here: One of those mock cowboys western songs, but I love it. It's the most interesting song on the album, but great anyway.    8) You Can Never Go Home: The best song on the album, along with the Story in Your Eyes. This becomes evident after the third listen.    9) My Song: A truly haunting and amazing tune. The middle section is so amazing that one wonders how it was done.    This album is a must for prog-rock fans, and for Moody blues fans everywhere.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is NOT a CD... this is THE CD. I have a slightly extensive CD collection of 36 CD's and this is my number one. This is what I think. <br />1) Stripped Part 1 - 5/5 - Sorry, but you can't define her. <br />2) Can't Hold Us Down - 5/5 - Great beat, great voices, great duet,great message. <br /> <br />3) Walk Away - 5/5 - Very emotional. We do NOT want to be in that situation, male or female. <br /> <br />4) Fighter - 5/5 - Sorry Aguilera haters, but this FIGHTER has won! You'll NEVER have as much money as she does or acquire the RICHES she's acquired. Have you ever had a $4.5 million mansion? That's the $4.5 million question. Only COVETOUSNESS can drive a person to PUT DOWN such a WONDERFUL singer like that. You're putting her down because you want her voice and her riches. LOL. <br /> <br />5) Primer Amor - 5/5 - But should've been recited in English for ALL listeners to understand. <br /> <br />6) Infatuation 5/5 - I was infatuated with Christina's voice but now I wish she made another CD to have the fresh feeling of it once again. <br /> <br />7) Loving Embrace - 5/5- Beautiful. <br /> <br />8) Loving me 4 me - 5/5 - Preciosa canci?n. Me encanta. <br /> <br />9) Impossible - 5/5 - Impossible not to love. <br /> <br />10) Underappreciated - 5/5 - I'm sorry that you're irrefutable talent is underappreciated, Xtina. <br /> <br />11) Beautiful 5/5 - Loved the song but hated the gay scenes in the video. It was definitely not a video for little kids to watch. <br /> <br />12) Make Over - 4/5 - We get it, Xtina, \\"You don't need nobody tryin' to make you over\\" but you're too angry. Try to calm down and most importantly, not to curse. Just kidding. lol <br /> <br />13) Cruz - 4.5/5 - Loved the message but slightly hated the composition. <br /> <br />14) Soar - 5/5 - The song I listen to when I'm having a bad day. It teaches us how to love ourselves just the way we are and not to try to change just to please others.  <br /> <br />15) Get Mine, Get Yours 5/5 - I don't know. It just sounds cool. <br /> <br />16) Dirrty - 5/5 - Great song; great video -- but not a great video for North America. <br /> <br />17) Stripped Pt 2 - 5/5 Christina openly and fearlessly lets us know, \\"She's not a virgin(...).\\" Nice move. You resolved my doubts. <br /> <br />18) The Voice Within - 10/5 - Want to know what to do when things don't go your way? \\"Trust the voice within\\". <br /> <br />19) I'm Ok - 5/5 - Glad to know you're ok, Christina. <br /> <br />20) Singin' my song 5/5 - You better never stop. <br /> <br />That's it. Like it? Great! (...) <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000033TE|5.0|This album is the best thing since sliced bread. It was my first exposure to ELP, and it sticks in my head to this day. It contains their magnum opus, Karn Evil 9. I do not own the version of this album with the track nine bonus track, but it is unneeded. The album is great enough as it is. <br /> <br />1) Jerusalem: The album begins with, in my opinion, an underrated song. I think its quite good, with Keith's original keyboard work. It seems that others don't agree. <br /> <br />2) Toccata: Another underrated song. Many dismiss it as just noise, but it is not. It's Keith's adaptation of Ginastera's first piano concerto, fourth movement. It doesn't sound like a piano concerto, but Toccata is great after you listen to it multiple times. First time through, weird. <br /> <br />3) Still, You turn Me On: One of Greg Lake's great acoustic songs. Great little short ditty. <br /> <br />4) Benny the Bouncer: Plenty of people see this song as filler, but it's great on its own. It has the feeling of a bar setting, what with the bar fight in the middle of the song. It tells a weird story, but it's great just the same. <br /> <br />5) Karn Evil 9, 1st Impression Part 1: Ah, here we are. In my opinion, Karn Evil 9 as a whole is the second best piece of music in the world, behind only Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick. The first part of Impression 1 is over 8 minutes long, and has two unique phases. Both are wonderful, capturing your imagination and transporting you to another world. <br /> <br />6) Karn Evil 9, 1st Impression Part 2: Is a shorter version of its predecessor, but with its own little twists. A continuation, but a different song. <br /> <br />7) Karn Evil 9, 2nd Impression: Keith on the piano and Carl on the drums. A little of Lake in the middle, but no vocals. Over 7 minutes of great piano jamming. Many don't like this section, and it is admittedly the worst section of Karn Evil 9, but that does mean in the least that it is bad. It is amazing. It just takes a while toget used to it. <br /> <br />8) Karn Evil 9, 3rd Impression: The longest song on the album, at 9:05. Truly amazing. Astounding. Outstanding. It bears no resemblance in music styles to the first impression, but it is the perfect conclusion to Karn Evil 9. <br /> <br />This is ELP's fifth album, and it shows that time does not always wear a band down. Creativity at its best.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I liked the album, it's different from \\"Let go\\". Great Lyrics, great sound.  <br /> <br />Take me away: Good, it's depressing but it's true! \\"Is there inside all I do is hide...\\" I think she talks about herself, it's deep and meaningful. Great rock elements on the chorus. 10/10  <br /> <br />Together: It's a great song. I feel so identified with it. The best part is: \\"My thoughts are choking on you my dear\\". I liked the guitar. 10/10  <br /> <br />Don't tell me: It's a popish song, but I liked. Good Message: Don't give it to the boys who only wants your sex. hehe.  <br /> <br />He wasn't: I liked! It reminds me a little about \\"Sk8er Boi\\", the music. It's not great lyrically, but aceptable. It's quite funny, is about the guy that you like doesn't give you a call. \\"He never make me feel Like I was special, cuz I was special, cuz I'm special...\\" Bit weird! But I liked! 8/10  <br /> <br />How Does it feel: I liked the lyrics, but I don't like much the song. But it's good. 7/10  <br /> <br />My Happy Ending: I understand perfectly why Avril could write a song like this. I really like it, it's a good song, quite sad but good. 9/10  <br /> <br />Nobody's Home: Quite soft, but one of my favorites. Great chorus, great lyrics!!! Next single, good choice as a single.   <br /> <br />Forgotten: My favorite song of the album. Strong, sad, dark and angry. That's what I like!!! 11/10. The piano it's great, the voice of Avril with her \\"ah, ah\\" it's amazing, cool!  <br /> <br />Who Knows: I don't like it much. But I like the lyrics. 7/10  <br /> <br />Fall To pieces: Interesting, it shows an Avril who is in love with a guy. \\"I just wanna cry in front of you\\", I feel identified. whoa! I really liked!! Great Ballad. 10/10  <br /> <br />Freak Out: It's a great song about standing up for yourself. Optimistic! I like the guitars and the bass! 9/10  <br /> <br />Slipped Away: Good song, but quite sad and slow. I liked it, but it is not my favortite. 8/10 <br /> <br />By the way...All the Avril haters can kiss my a**!!!!! <br />
B0000033P0|5.0|Wow. <br />This was the second album I came to know by ELP, after Brain Salad Surgery. It is one of the most amazing albums I know. Side 1 consists of one song, Tarkus, coming in at over 20 minutes long. Side two has 6 other songs, each one a gem. Here is my analysis: <br /> <br />1. Tarkus: Truly amazing. A work of art. Here it is, broken up: <br /> <br />a) Eruption: Amazing. Beginning in five beats per measure, one can only wonder how it was done. Marvelous. <br /> <br />b) Stones of Years: Great mellow section of the song, especially with the keyboard solo in the middle. Greg Lake at his best with his vocals. <br /> <br />c) Iconoclast: Something of a continuation of Eruption, but with a mind of its own. Amazing yet again. <br /> <br />d) Mass: Another vocal part, with yet another keyboard solo. Great, great, great. <br /> <br />e) Manticore: The third instrumental section of the song. Brings a new mood to the song, but fits in with the rest. <br /> <br />f) Battlefield: The one section of Tarkus written by Greg Lake, not Keith Emerson. Battlefield brings out more of Lake's guitar, but it doesn't compromise the keyboards too much. Astounding section of Tarkus. <br /> <br />g) Aquatarkus: The last section, and the last instrumental part. It begins with the Battlefield theme, only redone, then lunges back into Eruption. I love it. <br /> <br />2) Jeremy Bender: Although it's only 1 minute and 50 seconds long, it does not disappoint. It is simply a piano song, with one of the best beats I know. <br /> <br />3) Bitches Crystal: Could be my favorite song on side 2 of this album. Fast-paced and wonderful. <br /> <br />4) The Only Way (Hymn): Wonderful organ and piano here, mixed with Greg's great vocals. It leads right into... <br /> <br />5) Infinite Space (Conclusion): No singing, just piano. Another great part, although it might not seem that way on first listen. <br /> <br />6) A Time and A Place: Geez, I love this song. Fast keyboards, great drum combinations, and, of course, Greg's voice. Great stuff. <br /> <br />7) Are you Ready Eddy?: Great jazz song. It was originally written for the man who engineered the album, Eddy Offord, who also did many Yes albums.  <br /> <br />Overall, an astounding piece of work. It may take a few listens, but, after that, you shall realize that it is truly outstanding.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I didn&#60;t want to see it at first because of the violence. I cried through the whole thing. to think that Jesus did this for you & me! This is Love. Forever grateful
B000003S09|5.0|This album invented progressive rock. Many believe that Yes invented the genre, but Yes didn't turn progressive until The Yes Album, Yes's third album, which came out in 1971, a full 2 years after In the Court of the Crimson King. Robert Fripp is the ultimate band ringleader, along with the great guitarist/vocalist Greg Lake, although he was only present for the first Crimson album, after which he was recruited by Keith Emerson for ELP.  <br /> <br />But the Crimso debut is most probably their best album. It never ceases to amaze. I can't say enough about the album to convey what it is like, but here goes: <br /> <br />1) 21st Century Schizoid Man: The only upbeat, driving rock song on the album. From the first note that I heard of it, I was hooked. It goes from that hard rock to jazz-styled rock, with the mixing of guitars and horns. It folds back into the first rock section, and it is one of the best songs ever. <br /> <br />2) I Talk to the Wind: On first listen, one cannot fathom this song. It is the shortest song on the album, but that makes no difference. It is one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Period. <br /> <br />3) Epitaph: I don't know what to say. You need to hear it mulitples times to believe it. <br /> <br />4) Moonchild: Well, the first couples minutes is great, but then it enters into 10 minutes of musical noise, which sounds like random things being played on all the different instruments. Oh well. <br /> <br />5) The Court of the Crimson King: The most haunting tune in the world. The mellotron is used to the best extent its ever been used, and the tune sticks in your head for a long time after your first listen.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for the album that started it all, this is where to go.
B00005JNEI|5.0|'Nuff said. Buy it. Show it to as many potential voters as you can. Anybody who sees this film can't POSSIBLY say, \\"Well...I think Bush is okay anyway.\\" DOY! Bush is a buffoon. Most of us know it. Let's thank Michael Moore for giving us a tool to prove it to those who have their heads in the sand. The man deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.
B00028HBKM|5.0|AT FIRST I DID NOT WANT TO SEE THIS MOVIE   IT WAS NOT IN ENGLISH AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BORING  WHEN I SAW THIS MOVIE IT DID NO ONLY TEACH ME ALOT BUT OPEN MY EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS.  THE MOVIE IS ABOUT THE LAST DAYS OF CHRIST   CHRIST IS PUT THREW SOME HORRIBLE THINGS THAT NO MAN ON EARTH   COULD STAND UP TO  NOT ONLY DID HE GO THREW THESE THINGS HE PRAYED FOR THE MEN THAT WAS DOING THEM TO HIM.   WHILE I WAS WATCHING THIS MOVIE I DID NOT FEEL LIKE I WAS   WATCHING A MOVIE IN SUB TITLES IT FELT LIKE I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING WITHOUT READING THE SUB TITLES.     FOR EVERY ONE THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ALL
B0002IU988|3.0|No, it's not creed but it's not horrible.  I would much rather have Scott Snapp but Kennedy actually does a pretty good job considering he's not the best singer out there.  Creed has always been a great band to me so when Scott left I was shocked but Alter Bridge is a fresh, new \\"take-off\\" on creed.  The album really isn't that great, only a few real stand-out tracks.  The lyrics are probably the worst part about the album, no real meaning behind them at all.  Mark sounds great on guitar and so does the rest of creed but in the back of our minds we all want Scott back.  Since that probably won't happen I think we should just give Alter Bridge the time to mature, they'll come around after a few CD's. Until then enjoy this album for what it's worth, not what it could be.
B00005JMXX|3.0|THIS MOVIE WAS NOT BAD AT ALL   THE MOVIE IS ABOUT A MODERN DAY ICE AGE  THIS MOVIE SHOWS THE END OF OUR DAYS DUE   TO MOTHER NATURE. IF YOU LIKE THE CORE  AND ALL OF THOSE END OF THE WORLD MOVIES   THEN THIS WOULD BE A GOOD  RENT MOVIE  NOT A MUST OWN BUT A MUST RENT MOVIE
B000002KFJ|4.0|Sabotage is an improvement over it's weaker proceeder Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Maybe not one of Sabbath's best selling albums, but certainly not a bad album at all. Songs like Hole in the Sky, and Symptom of the Universe(a killer song with a great riff, the highlight of the album for me), and Am I Going Insane. There's not much else to say, if you liked the other Sabbath albums you'll like this one as well.
B00005JN2F|4.0|Not many sequels are better than the movies they follow, the Bourne Identity in this case. Fewer are better than a very good original. Even fewer are lots better. This is one.<br /><br />This movie stands well by itself, but also follows seamlessly from the first. Our hero, Bourne, has escaped a career as a government assassin. He is living a small, happy life in a remote village, with the woman he loves. Then she is killed in an attempt on his life. Bourne has just declared war on the CIA, and the CIA had better defend itself.<br /><br />After that, the movie is pretty much one long chase scene. Saying almost anything more would give away one of the movie's surprises, and the movie is full of surprises. I can tell you that the big car chase is a great sample of its kind, with lots of banging around in narrow, crowded streets. I'd certainly put my money on Bourne in any demolition derby.<br /><br />A few characters from the first movie have roles here, creating a strong continuity across the two. Watch for changes in the characters' roles, though - there always seems to be one more surprise ahead, right to the last seconds of the movie.<br /><br />This is a very good spy/action flick. The characters are all larger than life, without crossing over into distortion. The action starts at a run, the pace just picks up until the very end, and insistently pulls the viewer along. If you like action movies, this will grab you.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000002KDO|5.0|Master of Reality is pretty much equal in quality to the two albums that proceeded it. On their third album Black Sabbath is still able to write classic songs. Sweat Leaf totally rocks, a great song to start the album with. Another great song from the album is Children of the Grave with Tony Iommi's great guitar playing, one of the best riffs in the history of metal.
B000089RV6|5.0|great cd!!! <br /> <br />Hells Bells - best song on cd, great opener. AC/DC's anthem 5/5 <br /> <br />Shoot To Thrill - Another great song... 4/5 <br /> <br />What Do You Do For Money Honey - A great rock track 4/5 <br /> <br />Given The Dog The Bone - Awesome!! 4/5 <br /> <br />Let Me Put My Love Into You - OK.. 4/5 <br /> <br />Back In Black - Title song.. real good. 5/5 <br /> <br />You Shook Me All Night Long - Tied with Back In Black for the second best 5/5 <br /> <br />Have A Drink On Me - Good 4/5 <br /> <br />Shake A Leg - Not to bad 4/5 <br /> <br />Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution - Third best 5/5
B000002KB8|5.0|Sabbath is the ultimate metal band. I got to see them at Ozzfest 2004, they rocked, but it all started in 1970 with the release of their self titled first album. At the time of it's release there really wasn't anything else like it. No one sounded so dommy or glummy before. Black Sabbath opens the album with sounds of rain, thunder, and church bells so right off the bat we get into the dark subject matter. Second track is the bluesy The Wizard. Perhaps the coolest tune on the album is N.I.B. Black Sabbath is still a classic 34 years after it came about, and the band is still extremely popular after all these years, headling Ozzfest 2004 along side Judas Priest. This album is the beginning of heavy metal!
B000063DFS|5.0|Ozzy has had more successful comebacks than anyone else in the music business. After being fired from Black Sabbath, he released \\"Blizzard of Ozz,\\" one of the most influencial albums of all time. He then plunged into depression after his guitarist and best friend Randy Rhoads died in a plane crash, but came back with the decent \\"Bark at the Moon.\\" He then released the terrible \\"Original Sin\\" and although it was an improvement over the previous album, \\"No Rest for the Wicked\\" was pretty weak too. \\"No More Tears\\" brought Ozzy back into the mainstream, and it was one of his best albums of all time. <br />1. Mr. Tinkertrain 10/10- The perfect song to let everyone know that Ozzy was back, and a great opening song. Great riffs and vocals, as well an amazing solo by Wylde make this outstanding. <br />2. I Don't Wanna Change the World 9/10- Great riff and solo make this song worthwhile. Check out the live version, it's even better (and it got Ozzy a Grammy!). <br />3. Mama, I'm Coming Home 10/10- Ozzy biggest hit is very well written and has great lyrics. My favorite part is the chorus with \\"Mama.... I'm coming hooooome;\\" Ozzy and the backing vocalists sound great. <br />4. Desire 5/10- One of the singles, is forgettable at best. Nothing really special about it, not even the solo. <br />5. No More Tears 10/10- Ozzy's best song of all time and one of my personal favorites. Haunting bass and keyboards start this out and show up again in the middle right before it gives way to Wylde's best solo ever. If you have only heard the edited radio version you are missing out on alot. <br />6. S.I.N. 10/10- I still can't figure out what it stands for, but is a good song anyway. Possibly Ozzy's darkest song, but has another great solo by Wylde. <br />7. Hellraiser 7/10- Has a great chorus but the verses suck as does Ozzy's voice in the verses. Decent intermission and solo. <br />8. Time After Time 9/10- A decent song that is overplayed on radio stations. Somewhat sappy, I like still like it but can't figure out why it was such a great hit. <br />9. Zombie Stomp 7/10- One of my favorite intros ever is wasted on a mediocre song and Ozzy's vocals suck. <br />10. A.V.H. 10/10- Can't figure out what this stands for either but it is possibly the best Ozzy song that no one's heard of. Zakk Wylde has another remarkable solo, but would have been a good song even without it. <br />11. Road to Nowhere 10/10- At first I thought it was stupid until I really listened to it. The lyrics avoid being sappy and has a great guitar riff and solo by Wylde. <br />12. Don't Blame Me 6/10- I can see why the didn't put this on the original album, the riff isn't that likeable and the same with the solo. <br />13. Party with the Animals 3/10- Thank goodness for the skip button. The only noteable thing about this song is that it was on the \\"Buffy\\" (the movie) soundtrack. <br />Ozzy is a genius because even though he isn't that good of a singer (even though I like him) he is always smart enough to make it up by writing great songs and surrounding himself with amazing musicians. Zakk Wylde is one of my favorite guitarists of all time and the bass line in \\"No More Tears\\" by Mike Inez is unforgettable, he would later become famous in Alice in Chains;  Randy Castillo is decent too. Although \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" is Ozzy's most influencial album, \\"No More Tears\\" is definitely his best and I would recommend it for any rock fans.
B000002KET|2.0|The title track Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath is one of my personal favorites, but professionally the album Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath is one of Sabbath's weaker efforts. The album is pleasant, far from awful, but not as good as we'd expect. The title track is the only real standout, some of the others tracks like Killing Yourself to Live are ok, but don't really count as classics. The Best stuff on this one can be found on We Sold Our Soul For Rock n Roll.
B000002AS3|5.0|my ten year love affair with Oasis (and Noel Gallagher)!  All girlieness aside, I love this album as much as the first time I heard it.  I'll never forget the first time I ever heard \\"Supersonic\\". I was driving in my car, listening to the radio; thinking about how bad the music scene really was, and this song came on.  Immediately, I knew I was listening to something really special and damn near cracked my car up in the process!! Now, that's the sign of a great tune in my well-paid opinion............    This album was and still remains the fastest-selling debut album of all time in the UK. There's a reason for that. \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is everything a great album should be.  Great melodies, solid lyrics, stuff that stays in your brain for EONS........throw in Liam's snarl and Noel's guitar; a whole lot of arrogance and attitude, and you have \\"Definitely Maybe\\".  The whole album rocks, but the standout tracks are:    Columbia (I still play this one all the time)  Rock N' Roll Star  Live Forever  Shakermaker  Supersonic  Cigarettes and Alcohol    Slide Away (one of Liam's finest vocals, and the passion that comes out of Noel on \\"Take me there, take me there, all I know is that you can take me there\\" still blows me away).    Married With Children (A deceptive little ditty. It sounds like a quiet little acoustic number; but if you listen closely to the lyrics, it's a brilliant put-down of someone).    This album renewed my faith in rock music.  I grew up on the great British rock of the 60's and 70's just like Noel did, and I never thought music was ever going to be that great again.  Thank God I was wrong on that one!  I still think the American music scene is lacking (as an American, I'm ashamed to say that). I listen to mainly Brit bands (John Mayer is about the only exeception to the rule for me). Noel understands what a melody is and uses it to it's fullest extent.     Oasis is still underrated here in the States.  A pity really. Maybe someday people will come around to the band, with the release today of the \\"Definitely Maybe\\" DVD (which I ordered of course!), maybe a new generation will discover Oasis.  I hope so, at least I can say I saw it all from the beginning (I've seen them several times live, managed to get down front at a small venue in R.I. in 1995, and they blew the roof off the place too!). Rock music will live as long Oasis is around.  \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is proof of that, go get this album NOW.  You don't know what the hell you're missing.....
B00008WT5E|3.0|AcDC's third American album Powerage is not as strong as their debut High Voltage, but it does include a couple of ACDC's classics. Sin City maybe the best known song on the album, I know it's included on the 2 disc version of ACDC live. Gone Shootin is another highlight, some people may know it from Beavis and Butthead Do America. The other songs on the album aren't as memorable as these two songs, but Powerage on the whole maybe the weakest Bon Scott era album.
B0002TSZK6|5.0|I think that this movie transcends so called left or right thinking. Mainly it is about political, militairy and economical manipulation and about the cynical and macabre way this game is played. Offcourse it is aimed at the Bush administration and US policy in general. I think Michael Moore does a terrific and courages job in showing the machinations behind the Bush election and his war efforts. It mercilessy gives us a look at a stolen presidency (with the shocking footage of a hammering Al Gore in the Senate while us representatives try to oppose the outcome of the elctions) and the range of lies, crinimal intentions and acts by the Bush administration. For me, it confirmed things I already was worried about. For instance, the support Bush senior gave to Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. Also the war on Iraq was a deliberate attempt to attack this nation, for reasons which had nothing to do with arms of mass destruction.  <br />Moore does not go as far as accusing Bush for ignoring or 'staging' the 9/11 WTC attacks, but he clearly points out the (hidden)plane flights for the Bin Laden family after the attacks, and the way (public and private) investigations to the causes of the attacks were blocked. The question remains: what did Bush c.s. know or deliberatly did't WANT to know in relation to the WTC attacks? just look at the benefits for the administraion (patriot laws, wars on taliban and hussein, oil reserves in iraq, profits for us business, safety of israel) and one day, as every US politican or priest always claims, the truth will set us free. I only hope we are able to bear it.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|High Voltage is a great debut album. It's a Long Way to the Top opens the album. Then we are introduced to such classics as The Jack and T.N.T. With the remainder of the album, AC/DC gives us some good rock n roll. From start to finish High Voltage is an excellent album, and it is one of Ac/dc's finest albums.
B000002OMN|3.0|BAT OUT OF HELL is one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  This is because it captures the true spirit of rock and roll in a way very few can.  Vocalist Meat Loaf, writer Jim Steinmann and producer Todd Rudgren threw caution and tradition to the wind and broke every \\"rule\\" and convention of rock music and created something otherworldly and surreal, as well as some damn fine rock music.<br /><br />BAT OUT OF HELL II could have been titled BAT OUT OF HELL x2, as it is twice as excessive and twice as overblown as the original album, though, unfortunately, it has half the soul.<br /><br />Steinmann, after surviving on royalties from brain dead hits he wrote for Bonnie Tyler and Air Supply offers up largely trite and banal songs which manage to also be outrageous and pretentious, often at the same time.<br /><br />There's some good stuff here, though.  The opening number (\\"I'd Do Anything for Love\\") is an underrated masterpiece, as well as being the only song on the album that should go on as long as it does.  The very next song is a terrific rocker, but goes on for nearly twice as long as it should.<br /><br />Most of the album is fun and enjoyable camp, but Steinmann really needs to know when to put on the brakes.  Meat Loaf's follow up, WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD, is a far better album, which showcases his voice more effectively with songs that have more meaningful and interesting lyrics, and stripped down, less overblown arrangements.  It would be great to see Meat Loaf's vocal chords turned loose on songwriting along the lines of Pete Townshend or Robbie Robertson.<br /><br />BAT OUT OF HELL II is a fine album, don't get me wrong.  But it is beneath what both Steinmann and Meat Loaf are obviously capable of creating.  Perhaps someday the unlikely pairing will produce something more like the original masterpiece, but, considering Meat Loaf's failing health in recent years, it doesn't look promising.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Passion of the Christ is a must have DVD (or video)<br /><br />It is horrifying, graphic, detailed and yet enlightening.<br /><br />I cried through the entire movie. That's how much impact this movie had on me.<br /><br />Though sub-titled, it is easily followed. And since I just finished reading the Bible again, the scenes you can recall from the KJV Bible.<br /><br />Christ endured so much torture and agony for us to take away our sins. And this is not fiction. It is the TRUTH!<br /><br />Even if you don't believe fully in God and Jesus Christ, watch this movie. It just may change your mind on how His life was and what He went through for all of us.<br /><br />I love Mel Gibson as an actor. \\"Maverick\\", \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series, etc. But as a director, I saw a true artist. This was his vision of how he saw what Christ endured. And he followed the Bible closely. Pure talent. Exceptional movie.<br /><br />A collectors item, definitely!
B000026C3T|5.0|Zeppelin is Zeppelin, 4 guys together and each one of them , the best at that time with their respective instrument , there wasno drummer like Bonham then, neither Guitar player like Page, nobody had the voice that Plant had, and nobody played bass like Paul Jones , and they meet in a common place, Led Zeppelin just a very few times in history , destiny is so kind with the humanity, last time was with the Beatles and this is the reason: other bands have being capable of keep on working by replacing the drummer or the vocalist or the bass player and still be themselves but bands like Zeppelin the same as the Beatles , without any of the members is not the same anymore, is like a unique formula, a unique nomenclature, we cannot change any of the components otherwise we would never obtain the same, and here it is, the best of this great nomenclature Zeppelin are exciting , awesome , I definitelly think that after the Beatles and the Stones Zeppelin is the 3rd best rock group in history <br />HM
B000002Q7Y|5.0|This in my opinion is the best of the 80's releases for Kansas. As noted on my review of Freaks, Kansas is best when their song writers are collaborating rather than saturating us with songs by one member (my often mentioned Somewhere to Elsewhere, which suffered from too much Livgren). Walsh is paired with Morse on several songs and the collaboration more times than not works well. This should be a note to the band the next time they do a new studio album. Don't let Livgren completely write everything, allow he and Steve to combine efforts and a real return to Kansas will be heard.   <br /> <br />This is when Steve's voice started its change. His voice is more mature on this album and I prefer his vocal range here rather than on the 70's releases. I know that may sound crazy, but I think his voice is much better mature than the squeeky high pitch he had through the 70's releases.  <br /> <br />All in all, this album in my opinion should stand as their best effort of the 80's and should have more songs played live.  <br /> <br />
0385335482|5.0|This book is one of my favorite Chic-Lit books!!!! Entertaining until the end. I can identify, and relate with the characters. A must have.
1594200106|5.0|Let me be up front about this novel: it's one of the best books I have read in years, and considering the number of books I have read, that's a high compliment indeed! It's a beautifully written story, with mystery, suspense, romance, and wonderful descriptive sentences abounding throughout. It's also a great compliment to the translator, whose competence makes one feel as if this book were actually written in English. The characters seem so real, and the background so factual, that it seems to be non-fiction rather than fiction. I don't want to give away any of the plot, but this is a book tha centers around books, reading and authors, and the worlds that are created and lived in by them. I think that this is the author's first novel, and I really hope that it will not be his last!
0743243153|2.0|I've read all of Alice Miller's books (Drama of the Gifted Child, For Your Own Good, etc) and found that Peck recognizes many similar observations, so I hoped I was on firm ground. That ground dissolved as I got further into the book and Scott departed from \\"the truth of facts\\" as Miller puts it, and into \\"Grace,\\" interweaving religious-based assertions with his prior good sense.     Peck states at the beginning that \\"Life is suffering\\" and mentions Carl Jung's quote that \\"neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering.\\" Alice Miller states that this suffering arises from one of two circumstances: either the \\"legitimate suffering\\" that comes from facing and feeling the truth of our repressed, damaged childhood history without denial or delusion (since no one parents perfectly, we've all been damaged to some degree) - or the \\"neurotic suffering\\" we feel from either Depression or Grandiosity,  two coping mechanisms adopted when one is forced to deny (repress) the truth of one's damaged childhood history, and the tragedy of not knowing how to let go of that shield - even fiercely defending it through excusing/idealizing the parents who did the damage once one is an \\"adult.\\"    Peck's departure nearer the end of the book into the religious idea of \\"Grace\\" obscures this choice behind the second defense of neurotic suffering: religious Grandiosity. In Peck's entire book, he gives the concept of Alice Miller's \\"Helping or Enlightened Witness\\" only a single line - yet, this concept is a key path out of the hell of human misery. By confronting our own past, assisted by another human being who unreservedly champions the child we were, we recover our ability to empathize with the defenseless child in ourselves rather than identifying with our former `god-like' parental abusers and so heal our damaged personality, able at last to give ourselves and others the love our original caretakers couldn't because of their own unresolved childhood trauma. By doing this with another compassionate human being (an equal) rather than a god-figure (superior/subordiant), we accomplish two crucial things: we uncover and let go of the illusion many of us carry of a Perfect Childhood that never existed -- and so can also end our addiction to a belief in a Perfect Authority Figure first symbolized by our parents that, as adults, we all too often continue to dangerously project onto other all too human leaders -- resulting in the glorious discovery that at last, we have the right to think for ourselves.    While the first part of this book is very clear and concise, I feel that the author did a \\"bait and switch\\" at the end, beginning with straight psychology and detouring into religion, like starting off on a well-lit highway and ending up on a dark, bumpy backroad. If you want to read books that stick with \\"the truth of facts\\" from cover to cover, look up the most recent editions of any of Alice Miller's work and you'll find an author who won't gloss over the difficult and rewarding journey of healing childhood trauma with a magic candy-coating.
B00028HBKM|1.0|It should be called 'The Beating of the Christ.' The whole movie revolved around torture, some flash backs, and Anti-Semitism.    It was horribly translated and you are left to figure out what going on by visual ques.It is not a foreign film (as given an award for)and pure visual effects!!!     Garabage. One star is already too generous.I do agree its better than that William Dafoe Jesus movie, lol!     I would rather see Gladiator to tell you the truth.   The Best Jesus movie is Jesus Christ Superstar!!!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|Those of us who grew up on the Classic Star Wars Trilogy are more than a little disappointed at George Lucas' failure to \\"dance with the one that brung him.\\" <br /> <br />By failing to offer the release of the untampered with versions of his Star Wars films, he is in fact slapping the very faces of the legions of fans who embraced his vision. <br /> <br />I shall never purchase this revisionist nonsense.  It's not even worth the bandwidth it would take to download.  George Lucas is a very rich man because of the joy and entertainment he brought to millions of us during the late seventies and early eighties.  He's so rich in fact that he can foist the \\"New Coke\\" of Star Wars films on us, indifferent to the fact that it will make many of us Pepsi drinkers, so to speak. <br /> <br />Do the right thing George - bring back the Classic Trilogy.  Let the customer choose.  Isn't freedom of choice what America is all about?  Be George Skywalker, not Darth Lucas. <br /> <br />Here endith the lesson...
0393035158|5.0|I remember when my grandmother took me to a Buddhist temple when I was about 7 or 8 years old. I didnt like the smell of strange incense burning and all that animated scary icons painted in and around the temple in bright red, orange and tar black. I also tagged along with my friends to a local church on Easter just to get on the Easter egg hunt. I was just interested in eggs but inside the church, I remember seeing a symbol on the wall. It was a man on cross just being terribly traumatized. It was disturbing to see that kind of cruelty displayed on public view, I thought. Anyway, both occasions marked my first encounter of religion and just were a plain weird experience for a boy growing up in Korea.  <br /> <br />I think it was about that time when I first gave my thought to what really happens after death. But whenever I sought to have some Q and A sessions about God/religion with people I knew, I was surprised by their rigidity and unquestioning allegiance to their religion, which was on most part Christianity.  <br /> <br />I read this book after I read its excerpts in LA Times. It was very exciting to read since it covers almost all of stuff that I always had in mind about religion and its fusty antics but quite couldnt articulate it myself. I couldnt put down the book. Mr. Harris hit it right on the nail! I am so relieved to hear someone calling us to join the process of making rational decisions in religion and faith just as we are in selecting cars, homes and schools.  <br /> <br />I would just like to say that you owe it to yourself over many unsettling moments and thoughts youve had on those issues if youd just read chapter 1 Reason in Exile of the book alone. It woke me up ever more clearly.
B00028HBKM|5.0|A film by Mel Gibson<br /><br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" focuses on the last hours of the life of Jesus of Nazareth (Jim Caviezel).  The film begins in the Garden of Getheseme where Jesus is betrayed by Judas for thirty pieces of silver.  It ends with the crucifixion at Calvary.  The bulk of the film is what happens in between Getheseme and Calvary and it focuses on Jesus' suffering.  This is what sets \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" apart from every other film made about the life of Jesus.  Many deal with the life of Christ, and others with his teaching.  \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" deals with one very short, and particular, period in his life: those last hours, the Passion.  The American Heritage Dictionary includes as one of the definitions of \\"passion\\" as \\"The sufferings of Jesus in the period following the Last Supper and including the Crucifixion, as related in the New Testament\\", and that is exactly what this film is about.  This is Mel Gibson showing us what Jesus went through and at times I could almost hear Gibson saying \\"This.  He went through this for us.\\"<br /><br />While \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a very brutal movie, and perhaps half of the film features in some way the beating that Jesus took on the way to Calvary, it isn't the violence that has stuck with me after the movie ended.  What I found particularly memorable were some of the smaller moments: the flashbacks that showed Jesus with his mother (Maia Morgenstern), Jesus teaching, Jesus with the apostles.  Just as memorable, though, were the moments of betrayal: the look between Peter (Francesco De Vito) and Jesus after Peter denied Jesus for the third time, Mary (the mother) and Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) together weeping at the torture Jesus is suffering, and any time we saw Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) moving through the crowd, or tempting Jesus.  Lastly, Mel Gibson's handling of the Resurrection was particularly moving.  It is a mix between beautiful and simply powerful moments that allow this movie to rise far above what could otherwise be called (and has been) nothing more than two hours of Jesus being beaten.<br /><br />What makes reviewing this movie a challenge is that it is very difficult to separate the story from the filmmaking.  As a Christian, the story is one that is very familiar to me and is also one that I personally believe in.  As a reviewer, I have questions about Mel Gibson's storytelling.  If I knew nothing about Jesus of Nazareth and was not familiar with the story of Easter Week, would I understand what is happening in \\"The Passion of the Christ\\"?  The film lets us know that this is a man named Jesus who is being persecuted, that it is the Jewish Pharisees of Jerusalem which have brought charges against Jesus to the Romans, and they feel that he is blaspheming God.  For this they wish Jesus to be put to death.  What the film does not go into is why.  Are these Jewish leaders just blood thirsty?  Are they threatened by Jesus' teaching?  Is there a serious law that he has, in fact, broken?  Why are they pushing so hard for his death?  \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" does not answer these questions.  Someone who does not know the story of Jesus may not know why he is being brutalized to this extent and what promises Jesus' life and death, and resurrection bring.<br /><br />Viewing the film from my perspective, the lack of that detail being in the film did not affect what I think of it.  \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a bold, moving, powerful film and the fact that the subject of the film is so central to what I believe only makes it more so.  I cannot speak to what a non-Christian would feel about \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" because an emotional response is so personal and subjective, and that emotional response is exactly what \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" taps in to.  The combination of how skillfully Mel Gibson has crafted his film (excepting that little issue with exposition) and the emotional response that it encourages, this isarguably one of the best films of the year so far and may very well be a contender for Best Picture come Oscar Season.<br /><br />The one criticism that I would like to address here is the charge, of some, of anti-Semitism.  It is one that I do not understand.  At the beginning of the film, when Satan is tempting Jesus, Satan mentions that carrying the full burden of sin is too much for one man.  The suggestion is that Jesus (and therefore God) is choosing to do this, and that Jesus knows what is coming.  In fact, Jesus says as much in the flashbacks throughout the movie.  Moreover, while it is true that it is the Jews who turn Jesus over to the Romans, there were some Jews who spoke up against their leadership saying this was wrong.  It was also only in the power of the Romans to condemn Jesus to be crucified and the film shows Pilate symbolically \\"wash his hands\\" of the whole affair, which was a cop-out.  Pilate made the decision.  It is also the Romans who are brutally whipping Jesus as punishment before he is to take up his cross.  The implication here is not that the Jews nor the Romans who are specifically guilty, but rather: All are guilty.  All.  With Gibson's hand being the one that drives the nail into Jesus, he includes himself in the \\"all.\\"<br /><br />-Joe Sherryrages, this is arguably one of the best films of the year so far and may very well be a contender for Best Picture come Oscar Season. <br /> <br />The one criticism that I would like to address here is the charge, of some, of anti-Semitism.

B0001UL7RY|3.0|I liked her first cd more than this one.  The first was pure quality pop.  The new one has some good work, but does not measure up to the first. Avril has potential, but her less than mature lyrics don't work with the hard sound of her second cd.<br /><br />I hope she softens up her next effort.
B0001XAPX8|3.0|\\"The Human Stain\\" is very watchable. It does have flaws however. <br />Not the least of which is the miscasting of Anthony Hopkins.  The story is interesting, and holds one's interest for the most part.  The acting however is extraordinary.  You must see this film for the outstanding, right on the mark performance of Ed Harris. His intensity as an actor never fails to amaze me. Equally brilliant is Anna Devere Smith as the mother. Her subtle and underplayed role is nothing short of heartbreaking.  Rent or buy this film if you're interested in seeing great actors at the top of their game.  I haven't mentioned Nicole Kidman because I am still not sure she was right for her role.  Nevertheless she does a commendable job with a difficult part.  It was obvious that turning the book into a film was a challenge.  It almost makes it.  If only they had found someone other than Hopkins for the lead.  He's a fantastic actor, but is never believable for a moment in this role.
B0002I831S|5.0|I started getting the VHS version of Star Trek and soon stopped because of the price.  Yes, the Star Trek sets are mostly higher than other series, and yes, over the years, the sets will probably get the *Star* treatment, and yes, they will probably be less expensive in years to come.<br /><br />But I am watching mine now, and they look great, not perfect, but I will enjoy mine while you wait for perfection.  It has been 10 years since the VHS version.  Do you really want to wait until the 50th anniversary edition to finally enjoy the show again?<br /><br />Not me
B00005JMAH|5.0|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the three movies yet because of the darker tone of the movie perfectly captured the essence the book.  Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's interpretation on the book gave it the depth it deserved by showing us(the moviegoer) that the story need not be the same static state that the book is in.  The addittion of the pendulum clocktower was to give emphasis to the story's subplot of time but unfortunately many seemed to have missed that.  Also the scene with Harry and Buckbeak was to show Harry's continuing \\"freedom\\" from the bounds of childhood (and possible refference to book 5?).<br /><br />The only fault I found with this movie was the time.  I have heard that parents may be happy that they don't have to sit through an extra 30 minutes of movie but in my opinion this movie would not be suitable for those of the  younger crowd that would need parental supervision at the showing of a movie.  I hope the movie of Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire takes this to heart and makes it a two-part movie.

B000002J03|5.0|I'm doing some serious rethinking on Led Zeppelin. You see I actually hear the album versions because my neighbors play this while they're always outside, and I thought Led Zeppelin and Led Zeppelin IV were some of the weakest music I ever heard. Then one day while at a friend's house this afternoon Led Zeppelin II is playing, and it sounds great! I used to think Led Zeppelin was overated, but it's just some of their albums are overated. I still don't think they're the best band in the world, but why do they only play a Whole Lotta Love on the radio and not some of the other great rock classics on this album? This is one of the most underated albums ever, why does everybody ignore this album, it sounds way better than Led Zeppelin IV!!! I understand that Zeppelin were not as well known when this was first released, but come on! These songs get the least amount of air play and the music is actually good!! I change my mind, it's great, and Greg Dillson, whatever your name is, I suggest you try this one too, you will be as surprised as I was! You know just yesterday I thought Led Zeppelin was majorly overated, but it's just some of their albums get no recognition at all while the ones that are crap get all the credit! Expect to see an edited version of my review of Led Zeppelin IV.

B000001ELB|2.0|I was told Kiss was one of the definitive heavy metal bands, and that is true. But word to the wise, don't start off your Kiss collection with this album, it full of remixes that sound too discolike, too soft. The reason I bought this album was because it looked too cool, I mean who wouldn't buy and album with a completely platinum design. The first thing I thought when I bought this was, is this Kiss, one of the heaviest bands in history? If my friend didn't suggest I buy Alive, I would've never knew what true Kiss sounds like. Alot of people actually suggested this album, but a person should start with the normal version of a song, then listen to the remix. If you want to start a Kiss collection, buy Alive, not this.

B000002H2H|5.0|If you already read my Master of Puppets review, you probably have an idea of what this review is going to look like. Like all of my reviews I usually start with a description of the album, so I'll start with Ride the Lightning. Definite creative direction growth from the first album, which is almost nothing like all the others. This shows Metallica's change from a mainly speed metal direction and into speed metal with thrash. This combination is what made Metallica the greatest metal band in history(yes even better than Black Sabbath.) This album is also known as the first album where Kirk wrote his first original music (he used to play guitar riffs writen by Dave Mustaine and later used by Kirk for production of first album and some of the songs on this album). Here's my review of the songs: <br /> <br />1.Fight Fire with Fire:Great way to start off a Metallica album with the acoustic number than explode into full metal guitar assault. Awesome use of vocals, guitars, and especially Cliff's bass playing.  15/5 <br /> <br />2.Ride the Lightning:One of the greatest guitar playing in history. In this track Kirk & James prove why they are the best metal guitar duo in the history of metal(according to guitar magazine only Tony Iommi is better)! Simply put, one of Metallica's all out nuclear electric guitar barrages.  25/5 <br /> <br />3.For Whom the Bell Tolls:Awesome intro, this is also the same style as The Thing That Should Not Be except for Kirk's guitar playing near the end that totally sets up the stage for Fade to Black.  15/5 <br /> <br />4.Fade to Black:Meant to be depressing. When I listen to this, I actually feel real happy. When I get sad, I just listen to how much more this guys life sucks, and I feel happy for him. Overall, a great masterpiece.  actually Fade to Black has 10/5 <br /> <br />5.Trapped Under Ice:Before they were Disposable Heroes they were Trapped Under Ice! So is the music style of Trapped Under Ice. I'd say this is the biggest resemblence between RtL and MoP. The part that stands out the most is the intro and the ice crashing in the background.  10/5 <br /> <br />6.Escape:One of Metallicas least known songs, Escape is probably the softest Metallica from the first three albums. Well thought-thru lyrics.  8/5 <br /> <br />7.Creeping Death:Thought-out metal assault. The lyrics are intriguing(the other i day i was listening to this and I decided to read Exodus5-12),the guitar work go along with the lyrics to help create the image of slaves and the slaughter of firstborn. Watch out though because this one turns into an all out metal assault on MoP:Damage,Inc. 15/5 Damage with alot of thought put into it. <br /> <br />8.The Call of Ktulu:I have mentioned that the best tracks are instrumentals, and Call of Ktulu does not fall short of that rule. As usual the thing that stands out most in this instrumental is Cliff Burton's legendary bass playing, he is the Jimi Hendrix of bass guitarists. Only Orion is better.  30/5 <br /> <br />A great album overall, Ride the Lightning shows Metallica's musical growth since Kill 'em All. Gone are all the speed-punk like guitar and in are the speed-thrash direction. The most noticable thing about this album is the similarity between it and Master of Puppets, they both have the same song styles. What we see in Ride the Lightning is the beginning of Metallicas music evolution. Here are the tracks they evolve into: <br /> <br />1.Fight Fire with Fire:Battery <br />2.Ride the Lightning:Master of Puppets <br />3.For Whom the Bell Tolls:The Thing That Should Not Be <br />4.Fade to Black:Welcome Home(Sanitarium) <br />5.Trapped Under Ice:Disposable Heroes <br />6.Escape:Leper Messiah <br />7.Creeping Death:Damage,Inc. <br />8.The Call of Ktulu:Orion <br /> <br />As you can see there is a stage of evolution from Ride the Lightning to Master of Puppets. Ride the Lightning is the Beginning of Metallicas music evolution which is mainly due to Kirk writing his first music in this album.I hold onto this theory because the guitar in this one is way different than the first. The rest, is history.
B000002NIW|5.0|This album is perfect in every way and so are Deftones!!! BUY THIS NOW, it will be the best decision you ever made, then go out and see them live, which will be the most amazing experience of your life.  Listen to Mascara on this album, it is one of the most beautiful and haunting songs I've ever heard. Deftones always get 5 stars in my ratings and it is well deserved!
B000002H33|5.0|There's no disputing that, how can anything else come even close to the thrash perfection that is Master of Puppets. No other thrash album comes even close, even Slayer's Reign in Blood(sorry guys, but the bay city bashers are the only ones better than you thrash gods). Metallica's Master of Puppets gets the nod on:    1.Battery:Great opener, I especially like the acoustic opening, because it goes from a soft pleasent breeze and suddenly it explodes into flown blown guitar battle!  10/5    2.Master of Puppets:Like some of Metallicas greatest songs, this song is over 8 minutes(hey that is 1/4 of a Van Halen album right there!) but is still awesome. The greatest part in Metallica history happens in the middle of this song with the awesome instrumental part where the bay city thrasher just let out their creative instrument play. easily 20/5    3.The Thing That Should Not Be:Its really fun how the other day I saw this one guy review St. Anger with the title \\"The Thing that should have never been\\". This song is has that haunting bass introduction early Metallica is well known for, and then it shifts into guitar attack mode, I love the way they used the lyrics in this song. 10/5    4.Welcome Home(Sanitarium):Really great song, the best part of this is probably Kirk Hammetts famous 'riffs fit the misery' guitar playing. As great as Fade to Black is, this is only that much better. 10/5, hey Fade to Black was 5/5    5.Disposable Heroes:Sounds like a title for a Misfit song, this song is an example of Tallicas Sabbath influenced lyrics when singing about war. This track is the perfect example of the concept of this album, manipulation and control. 10/5    6.Leper Messiah:One of Metallicas most underated songs, Leper Messiah shows where Metallicas music direction is growing. Half of the tracks on And Justice for All have the same playing style. 10/5    7.Orion(instrumental):Why do alot of people think instrumentals are a waste of time? Metallicas best tracks are instrumentals,because they make full use of the bass. I mean Cliff Burton is perhaps the best damn bass guitar player ever, even better than Thin Lizzy's or Primus. Here Cliff shows just how damn good that is. 50/5    8.Damage, inc.:Probably my least favorite song on the whole album. This song is great because it has that all out metal guitar assault metallica is known for. You hear some of metallicas trademark stuff like James \\"ohm!\\" or \\"f%&k it all with f$%&ing no regrets.\\" On St.Anger they totally screw up the latter. The lesser strength of this track is the lyrics, Damage, Inc. just sounds like a weird title. but this still gets 10/5    Notice how all of these song reviews are 10/5 or higher, thats because they are all at least twice as good as the best. This album has all the song types Ride the Lightning had:    1.Battery=Fight Fire with Fire  2.Master of Puppets=Ride the Lightning  3.The Thing That Should Not Be=For Whom the Bell Tolls  4.Welcome Home (Sanitarium)=Fade to Black  5.Disposable Heroes=Trapped Under Ice  6.Leper Messiah=Escape  7.Orion=The Call of Ktulu  8.Damage,Inc.=Creeping Death    As you can see Master of Puppets is a continuation of Ride the Lightning, there are songs on both that have the same music style. The Thing That Should Not Be and For Whom the Bell Tolls both have dark, disturbing music and lyrics, while Welcome Home(Sanitarium) and Fade to Black both have music of the mind if you will. The pattern is they're the same songs except they evolve lyrically, instrumentally, and in direction.    P.S.: You will see a similar note in my Ride the Lightning review, except it will be describing going to Master of Puppets and not going from Ride the Lightning. Oh and sorry Greg, but you are seriously misled, first I thought you were a real music fan, but dude: Back in Black, Master of Puppets, and Sgt. Peppers lonely hearts club, and I called you a genious?!! I love you man but you need some meds.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT is an oddly controversial film.  Marketed as a star turn for Ashton Kutcher, it is more a film that, despite its big budget and excessive special effects, should have played the small art theaters.  Well, now, in the solitude of the home, the film can be watched for what it really is - an interesting concept based on the Chaos Theory: one tiny event can have cosmic end effects. The title references this theory: the flutter of a butterfly wing can result in a chain of events that may end in a huge, destructive windstorm.  The writers and directors of this film use a rather sophisticated example of a young man haunted by past events he recorded in journals only to find he is able to 'relive' those series of bad events, change one thing, and alter the outcome of the initial deed.  It just happens that his blackouts/memory lapses/time travels don't always make things better and it is only a final act of change/contrition that he is able to put the bad histories to rest. Yes, it is a bit sci-fi in technique, but it also elicits participation from the viewer who must concentrate to walk the maze created by the victim/perpetrator/madman/savior. The cast is well chosen and Kutcher for the most part is able to overcome his history of pretty boy, inane previous roles to make Evan (the history-altering proponent of the Chaos Theory) credible - and that says a lot.  The others in the cast do well with some occasional rather dreary dreadful roles inherent in the story, and while one wishes the cinematography/special effects could have been more sophisticated, the mood of the film remains unbroken until the rather surprising ending (Director's Cut version).  In other words, what on the surface may seem a glitzy, silly movie is actually a thinking person's film.  Give it a chance.
B000002J09|1.0|Why does everybody treat this album like the best invention since Hindenburg? Honestly, I can not express how pure annoyance it is to hear all of the songs from this album played like a gazillon-bajillion times a day. This album took alot of credit away from other great bands of that era, and gave the mindset to rock fans that all Led Zeppelin music was fast-paced blues. This album made me think that all Led Zeppelin albums sounded this crappy, but they are sooooo much better. I hate this album because it makes Zeppelins other albums look like nothing and Led Zeppelin IV gets all the credit!!! If I didn't hear Led Zeppelin II, I would still be hating Led Zeppelin. This is definately the sellout album.    P.S.:I know I originally wrote a review slandering Led Zeppelin as a band and all their other albums, but after hearing Led Zeppelin again and Led Zeppelin II, I've had a change of heart, so listen to this review and not the last one.
B00028HBKM|5.0|The complexity of the last hours of Christ's life has haunted spiritualists, theologins, Christians, Jews and Muslims for centuries. It is the mystery upon which the Christian religeon is founded. Christ was divine but simultaneously, human. So he was 'the way' but he also knew what was in store for him. The references to 'the new covenant' at the Last Supper . . . if you don't know about the prior covenants at Mount Sinai, or the Davidic Covenant (\\"From your loins shall spring Kings\\") of thousands of years earlier, you can't see the forest for the trees that Christ and the Old Testament come together as one story.<br /><br />So what is the mystery is that he was Divine, knew what was going to happen, and as a human, really wanted to avoid it. And, even more difficult to grasp, he was there to die for our sins. Our present sins. Our past sins. Our future sins. This is not an aberrant thought. It had been going on since the time of the the captivity in Egypt. Jesus says to the High Priest in the first interrogation in response to the question 'who are you?' he says I AM. This is what he tells Moses thousands of years earlier. I AM.<br /><br />So what Gibson is doing is to show people that Christ knew he was going to suffer, and that his suffering was human and extraordinarily agonizing.<br /><br />It's hard to rate in the conventional sense. Is it a great movie? Perhaps the greatest. Will you want to see it again? Probably not. Should Gibson be given accolades? Most certainly. But I would rather shake his hand as a man of faith then of a movie director. Somehow I feel he would agree. Larry Scantlebury
B000063DGC|5.0|I thought Eddie Van Halen was great, until I heard this, and like the Ozz says:\\"I'm a Believer.\\" Let me say first that I am a true metalhead, I listened to Ozzy before he sold his soul to mtv, so don't assume I just picked this up because of the tv series. Anyway back to the album, all the songs are great and there's not a song on here without one of Randy's legendary guitar solos. Since I usually rate by song and not albumwise, here's how it looks: <br /> <br />1.I Don't Know:Awesome opener for any live Ozzy, with insane riffs that make Priest sound soft, and the Ozzman's usual 'what is wrong with the world today'voice. 8/5 <br /> <br />2.Crazy Train:ALOT better than the studio version thanks to them cutting out the \\"all aboard!\\" and putting in Ozzy saying \\"Crazy Train! We're going to go WILD tonite!\\" Randy's guitar riffs are also insanely better here than on Blizzard. 8/5 <br /> <br />3.Believer:This one really surprised me, it just sounds more awesome live than the studio version. Ozzy's voice is the most definite improvement in this version. 6/5 <br /> <br />4.Mr. Crowley:The best version ever! Oh my god! Randy Rhoads solos are way more insane than in Blizzard, and Ozzy just lets out on the mike in this version. 10/5 <br /> <br />5.Flying High Again:I can bang for hours to this song! The only real difference between this version and the Diary version is that in the intro Ozzy says:\\"We're going to do Flying High, for all you people smoking those joints!\\" easily 7/5 <br /> <br />6.Revelaion (Mother Earth):The only real difference is that Randy jams in one of the solos. 5/5 <br /> <br />7.Steal Away (The Night)(w/drum solo):Ever noticed how The Night is in parenthesis when you can hear Steal Away the Night in the song. I would've rated it higher but that drum solo took waaayyy too long. 4/5, still not bad <br /> <br />8.Suicide Solution(w/greatest friggin guitar solo I've ever heard): OOOOOOHHHHHHHHH MY GOD! THIS VERSION IS UTTERLY INSANE! IF THERE WAS ANYTHING CLOSE TO PERFECTION, THIS AND A JELLY-FILLED DONUT WOULD BE IT! RANDY 3 MIN GUITAR SOLO IS THE KIND OF STUFF THAT COULD KILL YOUR GRANDPARENTS IF THEY LIVED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, ITS JUST PURE AWESOMENESS! EDDIE VAN HALENS ERUPTION SOLO IS A CAT PURRING NEXT TO RANDY RHOADS SOLO WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A FRIGGIN NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST! <br />INFINITY/5, THE GUITAR WORK OF AN IMMORTAL! <br /> <br />9.Iron Man:Ozzy and co. do good work on their version of Sabbath's music milestone, but this version is too damn short. <br />4/5 <br /> <br />10.Children of the Grave:It's one thing for Ozzy to create his own music for once, but if he does a cover of one of Black Sabbath's best hits and it eclipses the original version, then that just says something else. This song shows what might have been had Randy not tragically died, Ozzy Osbourne being raised to metal godhood. 12/5 <br /> <br />11.Paranoid:Same as Children of the Grave. 12/5 <br /> <br />12.Goodbye to Romance:This song is special because it is one of the Ozzman's powerballad standard songs. Most of the Ozz's powerballads in the later years get there root from this song(there's way too many powerballads on No More Tears, you can almost hear all of them on the radio!) 5/5 <br /> <br />13.No Bone Movies:This song is not bad, but this proves that Ozzy should never go speed metal. You can't even understand what he is saying because he is yelling way to loud and fast. <br />4/5 <br /> <br />14.Dee(Randy Rhoads Studio Outtakes):If you heard the Blizzard version, this track would be out of place. But on this album, it shows more than Randy's accoustic skill, you can actually hear him talk, and he sounds like a total metalhead! It also shows the depth of his need for musical perfection. 6/5 <br /> <br /> <br />Albumwise, all the songs are great and seeing how Sharon & Co. haven't destroyed this album by remastering it, I don't see how anyone could give this anything less than a five. This is the greatest live album ever,even better than Jimi Hendrix Band of Gypsys! <br /> <br />P.S.:Don't buy the remastered versions of Blizzard of Ozz or Diary of a Madman and don't try any of the compilation albums because the bass and drums have been dubbed over by different musicicians. If you're like me and like to hear a song the way it was meant to be heard or want to hear an album sound original, for ex.: a 1983 album sounding like it was from the same 1983 album, not some fake 2003 album, then don't buy the remastered versions. If you don't care, are a new ozzy listener, or own the original version and have enough money so that it won't really be a waste so you can compare the original with the remastered, then go ahead. Robert Truijulito and Mike Bordin are by no means bad musicians, in fact they're pretty good(Mike came from Alice In Chains and Rob is now in Metallica so that makes him pretty damn good) but its not the original members.
0393035158|4.0|At last, someone has pointed out that we are all driving into the future by the rear view mirror of the past. If we have any hope of survival as a species, we need to think about the truths that Sam Harris has spotlighted in his highly intelligent book. <br /> <br />Though it is scholarly and not always an easy read, it is worth every moment, every page. It takes a comprehensive, brilliant mind like this to open the minds of others locked up by centuries of now-pointless tradition. And to allow the enduring wisdom of the heart to come forth. <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|4.0|I've got a very bad feeling about this... <br /> <br />Almost 1000 reviews and the DVDs haven't been released yet. Seems that old Georgie has really stirred up a controversy here with his mods. Hmm. I'm an old boy, comparatively speaking, and here's my spew: I saw the original first run of the film in the theater as a kid way back when and I still have a beloved dog-eared copy of the book. See, back then in my day, there were no VCRs (let alone CDs, DVDs or the Internet) so the only way to re-live a great film was with a book and your imagination. I even remember a radio broadcast of the complete movie which I recorded on a cassette tape (remember those?) which I replayed many times and practically memorized. I won't mention the music sound track on 8-track. <br /> <br />Star Wars paradoxically became a universally personal experience for many people. And with great expectation and some trepidation, we anticipated the subsequent chapters which all built on the previous films' magic and did not disappoint. <br /> <br />Perhaps Lucas was too close to it, and then perhaps too far from it, for too long; the recent prequels do not measure up. They miss the magic by a wide mark (did we really need an explanation for the Force?) but granted, kids today might like them as much as my generation liked the first ones - so be it.  <br /> <br />As for tinkering with a classic, it might seem only its creator would be capable of pulling it off, but here, even Lucas has not quite succeeded. What he does not realize is that the affect the original films had on the viewer is itself part of what created the story's mythology; the audience is itself a part of the films' history. It would be like visiting the Louvre to discover DaVinci had returned to add acrylic highlights to the hair of 'Mona Lisa' and added Botox to her lips. Or gave her a nose ring.  <br /> <br />For Lucas, not having the technology in the `70s to complete his vision was unwittingly a good thing. A sort of forced editing that streamlined the story and left more to the imagination. The giant skeleton as a backdrop to 3P0 and R2 after landing in the desert has greater impact and is more suggestive than a CG dino running around Mos Eisley. And no Jabba until `Jedi' builds tension over all three films. <br /> <br />In the end, I suppose I don't begrudge him his effort. There was, after all, a chance the tweaking might have been more enjoyable. And I'm sure a new generation of fans have themselves only seen the enhanced release on VHS and have come to enjoy it as much as we did the original. If I knew the originals were coming, I would hold out for them. But if never to be seen again (like the theatrical release of `Blade Runner,' but that's another story...) then I will probably pick these up, throw some Jiffy-Pop on the stove, and crank up the surround sound. I guess it beats dusting off that old book and digging out that tape - even if I had something to play it on. And may the Force be...oh never mind.

0393035158|5.0|Over the past three years (not to mention the last few blood-soaked millennia) it has become blatantly clear that the greatest source of evil in history lies in the blind pursuit of organized, religious faith.   Any time a specific group is told \\"You are the chosen people,\\" this may provide comfort for the \\"chosen\\" group, but it will invariably cause problems for people who are deemed \\"unchosen\\".  Sam Harris' book points out that not only is the world teeming with people for whom their faith is an absolute, unquestionable truth, but that nearly every single one of these religious orders deems it necessary to either eradicate or convert non-believers to affirm their allegience to that faith.  Mr. Harris points out that, at the core of these popular faiths, there is no allowance for discussion, reason, dissention or even metaphorical interpretation.  Does it come as a surprise to anyone that people are recularly being destroyed in horrific ways to further these fantastical beliefs?  As the book also astutley points out, there is a built-in societal abhorrance to even discuss an individual's personal religious faith, let alone question their right to beleive, even if that belief is leading the world into horrific tragedy.  This must be addressed.  It is time for a new age of enlightened reason.  There is no more important issue facing us today:  Will we rise to challenge the warped precepts set forth by the ancient and uninformed peoples of an ancient world, or will we continue to allow many thousands of innocents  to be killed in mass numbers by those that feel they are doing \\"God's work\\"?  <br /> <br />Until Sam Harris' book, I have never seen this case put forward so clearly and reasonably. I urge everyone to pick up this book and truly think about its implications.  And as you think about the situation, think about the bravery it takes to face religious zealotry in all its forms, and send Mr. Harris a note of thanks for his fine work. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|1.0|This film is the biggest pack of lies I have ever seen. Anyone who bashes a standing president this way should be ashame. I sleep better every night knowing Mr. Bush is in the white house, as everyday Amercians we are going to have to pull together and make hollywood stick with movies and stay out of politics. People like moore don't relize that they are going to get the people mad that would not vote and get them to the election and Bush will win. Everyone needs to think too what if Al Gore were in the white house  on 9/11 Its a scary thought. May God bless Amercia.
038572179X|5.0|It could be the sudden death of a charismatic figure in a circle of friends; the murder of the love-object of an obsessed middle-aged couple; a gruesome and disturbing accident in an English park on a sunny afternoon; or the impulsive act of a jealous and creative little sister.  In either case, a story evolves out of a freakish event, itself rooted in some inexplicable (but obliquely recognizable) human drive, and it makes for a fine read.  Depending on which novel, the initiating event of the story might get told in the beginning or later the story, but McEwan tells it with just the right pacing, from various angles or points in time, or points of view.  In Atonement the telling happens with a rhythm so perfect and patient and the depictions of character are so on target it's spooky...you follow with half trust half dread.  This is McEwan's trademark, but his signature is nowhere developed so fully as in his novel Atonement.<br /><br /> The central \\"incident\\" in Atonement is a quick succession of actions on the part of 13-year-old Briony, which damages the lives of several characters, including that of her adored older sister, Cecilia.  But the baffling question of what compelled her is more subtle than jealousy of Robbie's love for Cecilia.  That would have been believable enough and sufficient to drive the events of the story, yet McEwan doesn't stop there, instead goes on to excavate more carefully with feather-brush, for a more subtle and eloquent truth.  Which is, I think, jealousy for Cecilia's own departure from childhood as it concerned Robbie, leaving Briony behind, as it were.<br /><br /> You recognize the authorial voice when the adult Briony, now a writer, muses that \\"A modern novelist could no more write characters and plots than a modern composer could a Mozart symphony.\\"  But the story really IS symphonic, and McEwan is rare in being a strong character author who can work a plot.  Some of the best writing in the book belongs to the middle section that is set during WWII, following Robbie in combat during the retreat from Dunkirk, and the war hospitals where Briony starts on her journey toward redemption.  But especially, in Atonement you can feel the author's nostalgia for the 19th century English gothic.  In Cecilia and Robbie are reflections of Cathy and Heathcliff.  Like the characters in Wuthering Heights, Cecilia and Robbie too were childhood friends, Robbie being the outsider taken in and educated on the philanthropy of the father.  And their years-long love story is based on a foundation of unconsummated abstracted idealism.  Other gothic elements include the events that take place on the dark and scary grounds of the estate house, and the absent (or ineffectual) mother.  But most of all in the way the character of Briony reflects one of the most enigmatic gothic heroines of all time, Henry James' governess in The Turn of the Screw, another young girl whose enormous imaginative precocity, constrained by chronological childhood, leads to unfathomable behavior.et during WWII, following Robbie in combat during the retreat from Dunkirk, and the war hospitals where Briony starts on her journey toward redemption.

0553565915|4.0|I don't know what to title this.  I read the book because my mother told me about it.  She sounds so much like a Mormon it isn't funny.  That's the way I see it now after having read other NDE accounts from various religious backgrounds.  There is no way to verify NDE's aside from finding things that coincide with one another.  So, as a story it is helpful in overcoming grief, affirming Jesus as a loving being, Heaven as a wonderful place.  I give it four stars because I find it well written.  However, I find it nothing more than a spiritual pipe dream.  The fact that everything is decided upon and agreed upon in Heaven is the kind of fuzzy feeling yarn that I was weaned on.  But in sad reality, life is just life and can be entirely confusing.  I do have a strong conviction in spirituality, though.<br /><br />Betty Eadie I believe is in her best efforts to write this book.  I don't think the intent is to make a buck.  But, I don't think any of us can give a definite answer to the afterlife if there is one.
B00005JN2X|5.0|I really enjoyed this film, despite the idea of a hitman taking a cab to his assignments.  I thought Tom Cruise was excellent as Vincent the hitman and thought it was a nice departure from his usual roles.  My daughters thought he was creepy (they are 16 and 13).  I didnt know very much about Jamie Fox but was impressed by his acting and will be willing to see him in Ray(the Ray Charles movie coming out later this year).  The cinemaphotography reminded me of the old miami vice series and I thought it worked well with the story.  The story moved quickly and had humor and seriousness interlaced through it. <br /> <br />I would recommend it strongly

B00004BZ16|1.0|Listen, I love The Clash being that they blazed a path for other new punk bands such as Rancid. But This CD is heinous and you would have to be a REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY big fan if you actually want to purchase this. I've heard better sounding music on MTV for Christ's sake. If you want to buy good clash albums, get their first one, give 'em enough rope, london  calling, super black market clash, or their live album. The Clash rock hardcore, but call Sandista \\"the only album that doesn't matter.\\" (Unless you're tone deaf or you're a poser and buying it because it's \\"THE CLASH\\") The only reason I gave it 1 star is because it's The Clash.
B0000CFW87|4.0|Josh Groban, the young American singing sensation has followed up his first release with a bold new step: of 13 selections on the disk, just over half are in a foreign language.  It's a nice touch to a great disk. <br /> <br />Not that there is nothing to improve on for next time, however.  I teach voice and choral singing at the college level, and while I'd take Josh Groban into my program in a heartbeat, he would have to change some aspects of his vocal production in order to successfully get out.  ;-) He's got quite a bit of vocal tension on his higher notes, and his Italian and French diction and pronunciation are surprisingly poor.  That said, this is a great disk, and a welcome change from the usual stuff we hear on the radio (my comments above notwithstanding, Josh still sings better than just about anyone else you might here out there).  The songs are well-orchestrated and well-arranged, and Josh is able to evoke a lot of emotional expression out of each one, able to be sentimental without being overwrought.  It would be nice, however, if the texts for the 6 Italian songs and the one French song included a translation for those who aren't already trilingual...  <br /> <br />I'd recommend this disk for those seeking a change of pace, something different in their usual listening... and especially for those who want nothing more than to light a candle or two and put their feet up for a relaxing evening at home. <br />
0062502182|3.0|This is a very simple story, beautifully written though and covering, in my edition, 177 pages. Though it's large print and very short lines across so you read it in a 4/5 hours. It's really a short story or a 'novella'. It reminds me a little of Of Mice and Men in that it's seemingly short and simple but it catches you. I have to say though, some of the praise seems a bit over the top: Life-changing? What the hell are those guys ON?  Whatever it is, I want some! The only thing that spoiled it for me was the Alchemists 'wisdom' dominating late on instead of a story. Loved the ending. Ideal book for a flight or train journey.
055321263X|4.0|I give this book 4 stars due to its extraordinary characters and great ideas.  However, it is not the 'greatest' mystery ever, I think there are so many other books in this genre that are even better.  Wilkie Collins was a bit long-winded, as many mystery writers are apt to be, but he excelled in creating an unforgettable, haunting story.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I am conservative when it comes to my movies.  I don't like remakes, sequels (usually), or re-releases with new and improved graphics.  However, I was not disappointed at all with the improved graphics of E.T.  He didn't look cheesy, out of natural synch, fake (I'm describing Jar-Jar Binks [shudder]).  I did not feel that the added scenes in any way detracted from the sequence of the film.  I appreciate greatly that he included both versions in a two disc set.  I would hate to buy the new disc, hate it and then have to buy the original seperately. <br /> <br />And thank the gods, Spielberg, that you had no intent to potentially draw out and ruin a good feature by making a sequel, prequel, or complete remake.  Thank you!
B00000AFHM|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums of the mid 2 late 90's. Magnolia's review is pretty good. The album starts real slow but then the rollercoaster begins. It's deceptive only how they can be. What earlier seems dreadfully out of place and having the consistency of a hurricane turns out to be sweet music at its purest.
B00003CX5P|3.0|It was a great film.  But I didn't like Jar-Jar, wanted more Maul, didn't understand the battle with the Trade Federation.  And I wanted more from Anakin.  To me he didn't seem very deep.  He just seemed like a dumb kid along for the ride.  Kind of like whiny little Luke in episode four.  I had the feel of the original trilogy that it was like an actual event.  I was watching the history of some other universe.  It's kinda hard to explain.  That was its appeal with me.  I don't get that same kind of connection with this movie.
B00003CXCT|4.0|While Mr. \\"Rolling Thunder\\" makes some valid points below about Lucas' technical updating of this influential trilogy, he misses a valuable concept - that films are more than flashy entertainment, they are actual historical documents that will tell future generations about the world they were made in and the people who enjoyed them.  The very fact that some of the special effects look out-dated some 25 years later becomes an important guide as to what contemporary society was like at the time.  Just as we now watch films like the original King Kong or Frankenstein with bemusment, it's important to know that audiences at the time found these images terrifying. By making the kinds of upgrades Lucas is doing here, and then denying the original versions existence, Lucas is in essence trying to re-write history, something that is very, very unfortunate.  It also seems to say about Lucas that he is more interested in the special effects than the artistic value of his creations. Will he continue to go back every few years and make more alterations until there is nothing left of the original films but the titles? At the very least, Lucas should have offered both versions, as Speilberg did for the ET DVD.
0061015725|4.0|I liked the evolutionary ideas presented in Prey because I also had a lot of time to reflect on them as I read the book while camping.  The theories and evolutionary discussions were far more interesting to me than the plot or the characters, I'm afraid.  The climactic scene of the final destruction of the mutant strain, while not the end of the book, is reminiscent of the take down of the raptor nest in Jurassic Park. <br /> <br />Crichton, keep writing and I'll keep reading.  You're very good, but can't win 'em all.  One book that really interested me by the same author was Eaters of the Dead.  I really enjoyed that.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Kubrick's killer film was based on the book \\"The Short-Timers\\" by Gustav Hasford. It is dense with gritty language and imagery that could never be depicted on the big screen, at least not in this country. Unusual and brilliant writing style, and a quick and easy read, 154 pages. This book is haunting me still! Highly recommended. It may be hard to find now. I tracked it down at my local public library.
B00000JBCP|3.0|Arena rock anthems open up this CD.   No Ha Parado de Llover, La Muelle de San Blas, and Vivir Sin Aire are big songs, sung powerfully by Fher and probably would sound even better with the band all plugged in.  Another review likens Fher to Bono, not a bad comparison, but Mana is no U2 when it comes to political/social songs.  Even though U2 could not pronounce Victor Jara's surname, One Tree Hill and Mothers of the Disappeared combine pop and politics in a way Mana can only dream about.  Of the four songs they try on Unplugged, three --Desapariciones, Falta Amor and Ana -- are very weak.  And what's with this instrumental Coladito?  Didn't Mana get the memo that extended drum solos went out with the 80's?   <br /> <br />So after those low points, what gets Unplugged nearly to four stars?  Simple.  In the last four cuts adding horns, wind instruments, and a battery of percussion to their guitars and voice, Mana brings the rhythms of Mexico and -- especially -- the Caribbean, salsa, cumbia, and meringue infused, to their set.  It makes for some terrific listening, ending this worthwhile CD with on a spirited and extended high. <br /> <br />P.S. The Spanish challenged need not worry; the liner booklet included adequate English translations of all lyrics.
0694007099|1.0|Agree w/ a prior reviewer - this book was VERY disappointing.  I was horrified to hear it read, for the first time, by a 'teacher' (who obligingly filled in the dialogue for the non-mouse animals, to say to the mouse: \\"No I don't want to be your friend. . .  your too little (or whatever).\\"   <br />I think it can be read w/ a more positive spin, e.g., \\"I'd love to be your friend, but I can't play right now. . . \\"  But the illustrations really convey a negative message to kids, and on its face is about being friends w/ your own kind, since it's only the mouse at the end who says \\"Yes.\\"  Not what I want to teach to my children.  This book apparently was written in the 70's.  It's way out of date, and I wouldn't buy it.  Other Carle books have the same type of animal illustrations, so it's nothing special in that regard either.
B000228WRY|4.0|Good album.  I like it better than R.Water's next solo project, but it is not as memorable as some of the early Floyd albums.  The imagery of the lyrics is good, and invokes several of the themes from The Wall. <br /> <br />I'm curious if this particular Import is in the replica LP format or not.  Can someone please confirm.  thanks.
0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris is a brave man. I praise him for his clear enunciation of the problem that blind faith now presents us with. I agree with everything in his book and am happy someone has finally put it out there. Religious fanatics of any ilk with modern weapons are definitely a different kettle of fish.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|Genius Loves Company has Ray Charles sounding as if someone had a fistful of his liver, which wasn't far from the case when these songs were recorded.  Terminally ill with degenerative liver disease, Ray was in no condition to record an album.  Sadly, the people around him and several of his musical cronies advised him differently.   <br /> <br />It is impossible to reconcile the Ray Charles on Genius Loves Company with Ray Charles in his prime.  The songs on this disc are a sad sendoff to one of America's few true musical geniuses.  In most cases the material here sounds as if it was cut and pasted together - Ray doing duets with another artist's voice tracks.  The result is insipid to the point of tragedy.   <br /> <br />If you love Ray Charles or you think that you may, do yourself a favor and pop for Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, at least on that album and many, many others, the genius still lives.
0375422889|5.0|Almost a generation after Art Spiegelman's Maus showed comic books can pack more punch than words alone. Persepolis is the closest thing from you'll ever see from Maus. Both are amazing literary works portraying extraordinary real lives witnessing history unfold. Both done by chain-smokers. <br /> <br />At the end of the first Persepolis I cried. I can't remember a regular book that gave me such emotion before, if ever (I also cried at Maus). <br /> <br />As an immigrant, I identify with Sartrapi more than with any author I've ever read. Maybe because her experiences with loneliness, heartbreak and xenophobia are so vivid they just jump out of the pages.  <br /> <br />One thing that's very evident in every page of the book is her immense patriotism. Her country is as part of what she is as much as her family. Thank God for that, because now there's a point of view of Iran little known to Westerners. And it's available in your bookstore. As a comic. <br /> <br />My highest recommendation. Run to get a copy. I hope publishers now realize this art form is here to stay.
0393035158|5.0|I grew up in Texas in the 1940s-1950s. I often say I am from Texas--as far from Texas as I can get. Much of this sentiment results from my exposure to very sincere, very intrusive, eager Christians who felt sincerely that my life, my actions, my thoughts and especially my intimate personal behavior was not only their business, but their duty to observe, criticize and correct.  <br /> <br />And yet, these guys were pussycats compared to the Islamic Fundamentalists who currently threaten us around the world. None of my old adversaries would think of blowing himself up with a bomb just to eliminate my percieved sinfulness, as apparently many muslims would today.  <br /> <br />Sam Harris has written a fascinating book putting the whole phenomenon of organized religion into an interesting perspective. Surely my fellow parishioners at Calvary United Methodist Church will be shocked. But I hope they will read the book anyway, to hear a person very definitely on the other side of the question put his arguments very concisely and convincingly. Religion, Harris believes, is perhaps the greatest threat to world peace and order. He may well be right. <br /> <br />It's well worth thinking about. Those of us who persist in following an organized religion need to think about Harris's arguments and respond with more than condemnation. What do we offer as counter-arguments to demonstrated the value of religion to us and to the world? And where should this dialogue go from here?  <br /> <br />Sam Harris, please let us have another book. Tell us where your thoughts should lead. What should we do next in practical terms, to achieve the revolution you advocate? And what would replace the valuable work done by churchmen in today's world?
B00003CXCT|1.0|I find it odd that people are complaining about the purists, and how they really really want classic movies updated with new scenes and CGI.  There is soooo much material published post return of the jedi in the \\"star Wars Universe\\" to make a hundred NEW movies. YOU DONT ADD NEW TECHNOLOGY AND RE-SHOOT SCENES TO 30 YEAR OLD FILMS! Remember colorizing! Old stories are \\"updated\\" (usually very unsuccessfully) by a new generation makeing thier movie i.e. Sabrina, Ocean's 11, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, Planet of the Apes etc. etc. Show off cartoony CGI with new projects!!! like the awful new Star Wars movies! Now if only Jerry Bruckheimer would redo Citizen Cain.  That would be awesome!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I read a few of the reviews, and I saw that a lot of people are angry that George Lucas changed certain scenes nad even added some in certain parts.  I only have to say, who cares?  The Star Wars movies are still great, and I'm sorry that a scene that lasts less than a minute is enough to make you get all angry and say \\"But Han should have shot first!\\"  First off, it is a movie, and therefore it should be treated as such.  Secondly, do you think George Lucas is doing this to please his fans?  It's his universe so I think he can do what he wants with it.  He always wanted Greedo to shoot first, so then when the SE's came out, he made him shoot first. <br /> <br />Now, I haven't seen these movies yet (Of course, none of us SHOULD HAVE) but I'm still writing a review ahead of time because the movies will always be great.  It is still the classic epics from the past and will remain to be classic epics in the future.
078681859X|4.0|I teach high school, so I read youth literature all the time. I enjoyed this piece.  It has a unique fantasy perspective, and yet a bunch of adults could sit down and debate the political society that Stroud creates.  My students are already fighting over my copy, and I just had it sitting on my desk.
B000089CJI|5.0|This cd is great and you should buy it, its rock and electronic music fused properly with just a hint of emoness. The best song on the CD is number 6, Clark Gable, people tend to over look this song because the beginning of it is kind of annoying but if you get past that you will really enjoy it, i promise. Maybe the only better song is 4 i'm not sure depends on what you like more. but you gotta buy it. I never heard music like this before
0393035158|5.0|The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read and the timing couldn't be better. Everyone needs to read this book. Sam Harris nails it.
B00004BZ0V|3.0|If you asked me a year ago what The Clash was, I couldn't tell you jack****. That's how little I knew of classic punk rock. I'm the young type with the misfortune of being in the MTV generation. *ugh* But recently, I browsed the web and heard nothing but good things about this band, so I went ahead and bought this CD. I began listening to it from the beginning. What can I say? It was fanstastic. I was skeptical at first, but it really is good stuff. But then something happened... I think it happened somewhere around \\"London Calling.\\" The songs stopped sounding so punk and started sounded like bad 80's pop, and I mean BAD 80's pop. WTF? I still listen to the first 8 tracks with the utmost respect for The Clash, but most of the rest of the album I can do without. It pains me when people talk about how punk \\"Rock the Casbah\\" is. I give the album 3 stars just because the first half of the album is just that good, and I expected some crappy songs anyway. However, there must be better The Clash albums out there. IMO, the best tracks are 1-4, 7, and 8. Oh, and for some reason I also like \\"Radio Clash.\\"
0765310015|3.0|Erikson avoids the slow introductory phase in most fantasy by omitting it completely.  \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" begins in the middle of the war, with little hint of why the war started.  Mages hurl bolts of energy with no explanation of the magic system save the power sources called \\"Warrens,\\" dimensional rifts that cleverly take the characteristics of each type of power.  The pace thankfully quickens once the action moves to Darujhistan, then slows with divine meddling outside the city.  The endgame occurs in the deliciously subtle setting of a masquerade party, but the conclusion resolves only one plot thread.    \\"Gardens\\" moves through several dozen point-of-view characters, but this scope leaves some major ones ignored.  Whiskeyjack is absent for a hundred pages after the first sections.  After being featured in the first chapters, Paran is absent for two hundred pages in the middle.  With demigods scheming and gods walking in a mortal's dreams, the human characters feel insignificant.  Their actions don't hold much weight when demigods wield soul-stealing swords and dead human characters are brought back to life by sorcery or divine will.      Most of these myriad characters are vividly drawn, especially the jester Kruppe.  Only a few have interesting motivations, such Whiskeyjack's angst about the war and Rake's concern for his people.  Except for Paran's conclusion and a thief who falls in love, no character develops through the novel.  They scheme and react, they fight, they die and come back from the dead, but they never grow.    The Malazan saga invites comparison with the current master of epic fantasy, George R. R. Martin, especially since Erikson's publisher Tor compares them in their own press release.  Although equally epic and detailed as Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire,\\" Gardens falls far short of Martin's work in believability and characterization.  Martin's characters are all realistically drawn; they grow and change.  In the absence of meddling gods,their actions have consequences and their deaths are final.  Erikson's characters are flat and the humans' actions ring hollow.      Despite this, \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" still outpaces almost all other current fantasy.
0765301598|1.0|Although the earlier books showed promise, this book lacked any real content.    It seemed as if the authors had tired of this series, and just wanted to finish it.    The plot was predictable and the characters very uni-dimensional with little if any growth from the previous novels.   Reading this was a sad conclusion to my DUNE series (father and son) reading journey.   For those who have read the other DUNE  books, you will probably need to read this one...    However don't rush to buy it and I would wait for the paperback version or better yet, borrow a friend's copy...
B000001FS3|5.0|As far as U2's studio albums go, if you're just starting to get into them, this is the album to begin with. <br />Why? <br />Because it's their most popular, and rightly so. <br />It contains the classic U2 songs: Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, With Or Without You, Where The Streets Have No Name and live favourite Bullet The Blue Sky. <br />Bono's vocals are at their peak on this album - yearning and powerful. <br />The Edges trademark 'jangling' guitar rifts are at their most prominent, particularly on such tracks as 'Streets', 'With or Without You', 'In God's Country' and 'One Tree Hill'. <br />The song's lyrics are also very touching, and metaphorical - arguably Bono's best songwriting's on The Joshua Tree. <br /> <br />Even if you're not a massive U2 fan this album is definitely one worth having in your collection - undoubtedly a classic.
0393035158|4.0|Generally an entertaining, insightful and provocative reading experience.  Neither Christians nor Muslims would likely be pleased with its treatment of the tenets of their faith, but the book for the most part avoids gratuitous sarcasm or dismissive reprovals of the faithful.  There are a few points that need correction (which the author has acknowledged), including a misinterpretation of the Immaculate Conception, and a reluctance to take a stand on so-called paranormal phenomena, as if there had ever been any proof supporting nonsense like remote viewing or talking to the dead.  Islam comes off particularly poorly, perhaps not surprising in view of their consistently bad press over the last 50 years, but I do not necessarily share Harris' pessimism over the fate of the Muslim world merely because the Koran is so stridently hostile to nonbelievers (the same argument could be made about the Old Testament).  The book forms a well-defined basis for reasoned discussion of hard realities, even cruelties, the world must face when confronted by the illogic of blind faith.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Well, lets just say that the changes might be for the better, but I think its more or less that Lucas has to fill the holes in the storyline that didnt work at all. I cant wait to the Ultra Extended Editions to come out of Lord of the Rings in the next 40 years
B0001CNPLI|4.0|Unlike what some of the other reviews have stated, this is not spliced together episodes from a Japanese tv show. Actually, it is spliced from the first two (there are six in the series) Lone Wolf and Cub movies: Sword of Vengeance and Baby Cart at the River Styx. It is also not a kung fu film because for one thing, kung fu is a martial art form from China and this movie is from Japan and is involving samurai (who don't practice kung fu).  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, taking two movies and cutting them down to one movie half as long hurts the story of the films. In the original films, the Shogun didn't just up and decide that he was threatened by Ogami Itto and decide to kill his family. The story is more involved and the viewer has a much stronger emotional connection with the characters of the story when watching the original versions of the film in two separate parts.  <br />Also, the Lone Wolf and Cub series has seen a recent release onto DVD by AnimEigo and the picture and sound quality on these new DVD transfers is astounding when compared to this film. It literally looks as if it is a recent release instead of a film from the 70s. Additionally, these DVD releases contain the original Japanese audio tracks (matched with the AnimEigo's superb subtitles) not a horrible English dubbing as contained in Shogun Assassin. <br /> <br />All this combined, it is impossible for me to recommend this film over the originals to anyone. Granted, they both still contain ridiculous blood spurting and great swordplay and you'll still have a good time watching either Shogun Assassin or the original Lone Wolf and Cub movies but Shogun Assassin is just inferior. However, if (and only if) you really hate subtitles in your movies, then Shogun Assassin might be the way to go. <br /> <br />The Lone Wolf and Cub films themselves are based off of a classic manga; partly released by the same name in the US by Action Comics. More recently, Dark Horse Comics released it in its entirety in a28 vol. (8,000+ pages) series. The story is more fleshed out and much more involved in the manga and the artwork is incredible. Anyone who enjoys the Lone Wolf and Cub films would be doing themselves a favor by checking them out. It should be noted to anyone who has seen the movie series to its \\"conclusion\\", that the manga does has an appropriate ending unlike that of the film series and its conclusion is more than satisfying.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Many of those already familiar with Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" (1889) have also seen the 1979 version of this film which is based on Conrad's novella. What we have here is an expanded version released in 2001 which includes 53 minutes which had been cut from its predecessor. Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) is given a delicate and potentially dangerous assignment: To proceed to Cambodia, locate Colonel Kurtz (Marlow Brando), and then eliminate him. Why? In the view of his superiors, Kurtz is a renegade officer who has become more than an embarrassment; as a highly decorated military hero, Kurtz poses a serious contingent PR liability. Frankly, I think Brando is (at best) listless, drifting along to earn an exorbitant fee for only a few minutes on screen, just as Orson Welles so often did toward the end of his acting career. The film's weak ending is in large measure the result of Brando's apparent indifference to Coppola's objectives. Sheen is fine. The supporting cast is also strong, notably Robert Duvall (Lt. Colonel Kilgore) who received an Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Frederic Forrest (Chef), Albert Hall (Chief), Samuel Bottoms (Lance), Laurence Fishburne (Clean), Dennis Hopper (photo-journalist), and G.D. Spradlin (General). Director Francis Ford Coppola was also involved with composing the music score (with Carmine Coppola) and the screenplay (with John Milius). Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is stunning, earning him an Academy Award for it. Were this film more cohesive and had its conclusion had greater dramatic impact, I would have rated it higher.
0345440900|5.0|It has been many months since I read this book and actually was reading the reviews because I am going to buy this for a co-worker who is expecting. My son is now 1yr old, sleeps wonderful thru the night, goes to sleep for both naps and night-time 98% of the time with no fuss, always in his crib, and honestly it is all due to reading this book.  I didn't read this book before my son was born and in the first few weeks found that life as a new mother was not easy.  After reading this book and using the EASY system after several weeks my son got into a great routine.  The main concept of this book it to teach you some universal similarities for most babies and to Use common sense. This book was a lifesaver to me and I plan on buying it for anyone and everyone I know who is expecting.   <br /> <br />I read one review that said that this book was not the best in breastfeeding and that might be true, but I don't think it was meant to be the guide for all the techniques for breastfeeding. Take classes and speak to a local lactation consultant for breastfeeding 101 pointers. Use this book as a guide to read your babies signals and get some kind of routine to be able to get a good nights sleep. <br /> <br />Every mother should read this book!!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have both the original and CGI special additions and I love them both.What im looking for in this DVD released version are few but important aspects . <br />1st. Im waiting to play and pause and then play,and then rewind and then pause with the Crisp digital play that comes with the dvd age. <br />2nd. I cant wait to feast my eyes and time on the Documentary with behind the scenes cuts from all three titles.what else can you ask for at a time like this? <br />Emotionally I am not so flicked by Lucas 's visions on and upgrade.I will not whine and complain about anything he does with his creations,even if its becoming gay with glee for adults and lame for hardcore fans ( mostly self proclaimeded fans ) either ways of looking at it ..5 stars to the whiners for the Originals and 5 stars for the untamed CGI fans.keep in mind that we didn't do the work that originated this Great Sci-fi ! <br />untill someone goes out there and makes a great Sci-movie thats gonna blow lucas mind away.I'm gonner look at all the spoiled fans with contempt! <br />Star wars fan since 1977,bruce lee fan since 1975 <br />-V.V
B0002KVUKM|5.0|What on earth are all of your problems with this movie? Some of you say its boring?? Well, struth, you must be one hell of a hard person to keep interested. If you thought this movie was boring, then i think no other action movie will ever keep you interested. <br /> What is this crap about the story was so hard to follow? I am guessing that the people criticising the story, are the people with pathetic concentration spands. Maybe if the director had known you like simpler stories, and not complex ones, he would have made it more easy for you.  <br /> Special effects did not over take this movie. It made it great. I cannot understand the critics of this movie. When i saw these reviews, i hadnt watched it, and didnt want to. But when i eventually did watch it, at a friends house, i couldnt bellieve that these critics were talking about this movie.  <br /> For me, this is a great movie. You critics need to stop knocking a movie that isnt bad at all!
B00028HBKC|5.0|The Passion Of The Christ was a great film by Mel Gibson! I was so excited about sending my mom out to pick me up a copy the day it was released! When my family put it in for us to watch, I was excited and antisapating what the movie would be like. I do not want to spoil anything for anyone so I'm going to try and limit what I say. A lot of the movie was very graphic it was like you could almost feel what Jesus went through. Weather you are Religious or not you need to see this movie. This is how good that movie is! I flinched a couple of times during the really graphic parts of the movie but, I expected that to happen.  <br /> <br />I really think Mel did a wonderful job on this film. I really enjoyed seeing this film because it made me think. By the end of the movie my mom, my two sisters and I were crying like babies. I would not change a single thing about that film.
B00008WT5E|5.0|If you're `ready for a good time' then you better put in one of my favorite CDs, AC/DC's The Razors Edge. This CD may be from the 20th Century, but it is still an album that rocks the 21st Century.  AC/DC, in my opinion, compiled one of the greatest lists of songs and recorded them  all onto one of the greatest CDs I have ever heard. When comparing them to all other genres of music of today, I vote AC/DC hands down. I'm not sure how you can go wrong by listening to this AC/DC CD.  In my opinion, AC/DC sure knew what they were doing when they made this CD. I mean with songs like Thunderstruck and Money Talks, how can you not like it? The lyrics to these songs are easy to understand and relate to. They get my heart racing and my head banging.  From Got You By the Balls to The Razors Edge, AC/DC's CD has everything.  Every time a DJ throws on an AC/DC song, the average, laid back crowd seems to want to sing along. It's like it fills the room with an instant energizer. The bass comes coursing thought the crowd zigging and zagging seeming to fill them with a new found energy like when a river bursts through a dam and looks alive again. This music seems to have the same affect on the crowd, waking them and bringing them to their feet. This CD was one of my all time favorites to listen to while warming up for either a wrestling match or football game. It seemed to help me get my mind set on the match or game mainly keeping me focused. So if you're looking for a CD to get you ready for the game or to just give you a little energy boost, this CD, in my opinion, should do the trick.  <br /> <br />                                              Pleier
0440180295|5.0|This is Kurt Vonnegut's finest book in my opinion. The writing is just perfect. Slaughter House Five was Vonnegut's way of dealing with the bombing of Dresden, which he was present at. He takes the complicated, but excellent aproach of telling the story in fragments, broken up over the course of history. We follow Billy Pilgrim, who is \\"unstuck in time\\" as he relives the events of his life. Billy is a passive protagonist and is not meant to be liked by the reader. We do not know whether what he is experiencing is real or not, but Billy always leaves a difficult situation to one of more comfort, rather than dealing with it, the opposite of what Vonnegut does while writing this book. Lastly, this book is anti-war. The question put forth is, even during World War II, did the people of Dresden deserve to be incinerated? Is destruction like this, no matter what the reason ever justified? Vonnegut leaves that for the reader to decide. There is a reason why this book is considered to be one of the greatest American novels of all time.
B0000048V8|5.0|This movie succeeds on several levels simultaneously: Musically, artistically, and expositionally.  The only drawback is the physical product itself: My VHS is wearing poorly and almost from the start has had tracking problems.  Others who have this movie have noted similar problems, so the videotape seems to be of poor quality.<br /><br />That said, the movie itself is wonderful.  Taken from the book of the same name, there is no talking in the movie.  Colored pencil images are the source of the animation.  They are understated, but beautiful.<br /><br />The music is excellent and the entire score is noteworthy and enchanting.<br /><br />Lastly the story is timeless and Christmas oriented.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for children from 1 to 99.  If you're looking for violent action or insipid humor, this is not the movie for you.
0393035158|5.0|The time of fairy tales must come to a close. \\"The End Of Faith\\" is a bold, brave, and sobering look at the consequences of our continued \\"belief\\" in the ancient religious fables in our modern world. It is no longer reasonable to maintain political correctness and 'respect' the religious beliefs of others when those beliefs by definition preclude any semblence of reason. Sam Harris points out that throughout history our differences of 'faith' have been the main cause of human suffering, death, persecution, torture, and war. The problem we now face is that in the past, it took armies of thousands to inflict heavy casualties, but now just a few of the \\"faithful\\" can murder not only thousands (9/11), but millions of people in mere seconds. The very existence of mankind is at stake here. This book is that important. <br /> <br />I think this book is superb and provacative reading. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in exploring religion in general, seekers of reason, truth, and indeed anyone who hopes humanity will progress to the 22nd century. 500 years from now, if we make it that far, and humanity is colonizing distant planets, will we have Islamic colonists? Jewish colonists? Mormon colonists? One rocket ship for each? Will we export religious bickering to other worlds? Sam Harris thinks our descendants will regard our current beliefs about 'faith' as we regard previous 'beliefs' about alchemy and human sacrifice. <br /> <br />\\"The End Of Faith\\" is a clarion call to all people of reason. We cannot tolerate our religious differences forever, the consequences are now unimaginable.
B000268QB2|5.0|A truly lovely and enduring album - that serves up a fresh melodic feast worthy of all the praise. The vocals are infectious; and the fact that such beautiful music can be created with these core essentials (drums, keys, vocals) should prove inspiring to many other bands.<br /><br />I think the magic of this album exists in the combination of heartfelt lyrics, passionate singing and song structures that stir the soul.<br /><br />So many bands really sound horrible when they play their late night talk show gigs; it is refreshing to see an exception to the rule. The passion this band displays in a live format does the recording much justice.<br /><br />This one and Edie Brickell's warrant my votes for two of the best albums released in 04.
B00000IPAX|1.0|... it sure cleaned my pockets out. I used to like Blink, i had the first two poser albums, and this killed the band for me, it is so bad i tore up the cover, and set my tape of it on fire. Do not buy this! Even when i listened to this poppy stuff, i hated this.
0452282152|4.0|This book was very good, and it is a very fast read (it took me two evenings).  A friend recommended it to me, knowing my interest in art; and at first I was a bit apprehensive because the book is more description than plot.  However, it was wonderful; and even though the book was very descriptive, Chevalier doesn't get too lost in her own words.  The book is told in the first person, which I think was a wise decision on the author's part.  It is the thoughts of the main character that make the story worth reading, watching her take in the world around her and respond to it.  The only thing I was disappointed in was that the conflict in the book was a bit anticlimatic -- I think that the description on the back of the book makes it seem that there is more going on in the story than there actually is.  But, beyond that (and my disappointment was really just the result of my own expectations), the book was wonderful.  I highly recommend it.
068484267X|5.0|If there ever was a book that caused you an emotional dilemma where you don't know if you should cry for the pain and suffering Frank McCourt and his brothers and mother experienced or if you should be happy that they survived it and are now better from it.  Nonetheless, this is an excellent book.  Frank McCourt has a very distinct style of writing that's sure to grab your interests and never let go.   <br /> <br />Frank McCourt never had it easy.  First off he was an illegitimate child and it's really heartbreaking when he finds this out and that he was condemned from birth according to the Catholic faith.  The fact that he looked and acted like his father who was from the North and not as respected, didn't help him in any way either.  He witnessed first hand his father's careless behavior and when he got his first job he remembered how his father was and vowed not to be like that, he even witnessed the death of his only sister, twin brothers and another one of his brothers who was just a baby.  While just a young teen he was the sole bread winner and went on to work in America remembering his mother and brothers back home who he had to support.   <br /> <br />Frank McCourt is in my eyes a hero and anyone reading this book will no sooner agree. <br />
0345409671|4.0|...but still a brilliant book. I read it during my breaks at the Scope Charity shop and it enthralled me right away. An absolutely thrilling storyline, the plot immediately draws the reader in, whereas the end is so sad I nearly wept. If you're a Lestat fan, or a Chronicles fan, you'll love this book - I recommend you pick it up today.
0553277472|5.0|It has been decades since Robert Pirsig's \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" became a best seller, but you can still find a copy in the philosophy section of any chain book store, which would strongly suggest it has achieved the status of a modern day classic in this age of ephemeral phenomena and the eminently forgettable.  In a number of ways, it is an exceptional and unusual book.<br /><br />After one has sorted out the different elements, however, separating the personal from the more objective and the entertaining story from the philosophical ideas, Pirsig's solutions seem somewhat weak and one-sided.  Because he is never really able to let go of rationality-- except when he carried it to extremes and became mentally ill-- he never finds spirituality.  Instead, he finds a concept which lies between the two, and which unites them and combines them to a certain degree, and he grabs on to this concept and builds his philosophy around it, making it the centerpiece of the ideas which he offers up to the reader.  This concept is the idea of Quality-- Quality being a combination of right mindfulness and knowledge, of attitude and technique, of values and tools.<br /><br />When a philosopher capitalizes a word, both the reader and the philosopher himself should be wary. Quality is a Platonic-like Idea and Pirsig is something of an Idealist who believes that a motorcycle is \\"primarily a mental phenomenon\\".  But as far as connecting Zen and motorcycle maintenance, or transcending spiritual consciousness and technical rationality, the concept of Quality does not pass inspection, make the grade, or win the blue ribbon.  Pirsig failed to find the synthesis he was looking for, because he didn't really understand spirituality.  His book talks a great deal about motorcycles and very little about Zen.  His Phaedrus studied Eastern philosophy in India for a number of years, but never meditated because \\"it made no sense to him\\".  After gaining a disappointing intellectual acquaintance with Buddhism, something he could have just as well have obtained from a book, he returned to the U.S., not much the wiser for his experience.  Philosophical Phaedrus may have had zenophobia.  Then he turned himself into a sado-maso-sophist, asking and answering questions under the hot lights, tightening the mental thumbscrews on his head, and slowly racking his mind on a torturous metaphysical system until he broke, he confessed, he spilled the secret to himself, which was that he didn't really know all those things he thought he knew.lectual acquaintance with Buddhism, something he could have just as well have obtained from a book, he returned to the U.S., not much the wiser for his experience.

B0002DB52M|2.0|A pretentious, tedious, overwritten, self-conscious, artsy film, horribly scripted, ... yet raises some interesting questions.<br /><br />A mysterious woman (Nicole Kidman) seeks refuge in the small town of Dogville. Its inhabitants welcome her at first, then become increasingly ... demanding. You see the ending coming a mile off. The questions?<br /><br />Can a town be so horrible that it should be wiped off the face of the earth? Dogville answers that question somewhat. In retrospect, Kidman's character seems to be a Christ-figure, an idealist trying to forgive. But in the end, we conclude, nay, we demand that Dogville be destroyed, and all that dwell within - even its children. We want her to choose vengeance. We know that it would be justified.<br /><br />And suddenly we understand why Sodom and Gomorrah were judged for \\"inhospitality.\\" And more importantly, we can understand why they could be judged in that manner, how mere people can warrant such a terrible fate.<br /><br />Too bad the script is a pig's breakfast. As I said, preternaturally self-conscious, trying so hard to be profound, yet it moves so slowly and predictably and ... pedestrian(-ally?). The acting ... well, the actors do their best with the disaster they were given to work with, but it comes off as mostly unnatural, untrue-to-life. The cadence is Mamet-wannabe. I don't understand the other reviews that address anti-Americanism, as this movie doesn't have anything to do with it. Unless Americanism demands some level of subtlety, polish,  entertainment, and excellence, that is.<br /><br />So, mostly muck. But, strangely, if you've sat through it, the message is worthwhile pondering.
0790740443|5.0|Good storyline.<br /><br />Good acting (a bit stilted) but I like it.  Kurt Russell PLAYS the part of an emotionally empty soldier dumped into a society.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />---------------------------<br /><br />&#62; Feels low budget.  The storyline is good but could have had a better and been a bit less bleak.  I don't mind dark but the visual feel of the movie was &#34;B movie&#34;<br /><br />If you are looking for amazing dialog look elsewhere, if you are looking for Kurt representing caged emotion you will find it.<br /><br />If you are looking for cool special effects look to Star Wars or I Robot or any other recent movie.  If you want a good story with plausible (albeit flat effects) you will find it here.<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />That said I bought it because of the action, and story.<br /><br />In some ways this is a clich&eacute; film, it has the \\"one guy against overwhelming odds\\" storyline.  I like the interaction and the &#34;healing process&#34; which includes him dealing with everyone else as &#34;sir&#34; and finally figuring out some don't deserve the title. I just love the concept of a conditioned &#34;pure&#34; soldier dropped out of his controlled environment, and gravitating to what is truly &#34;right&#34; (protecting innocents).<br /><br />Plus a good ending is a prerequisite for a 5 star from me.<br /><br />As I said 5 stars:  Action, good story, and good acting (mostly) + my gratuitous happy ending.
0783227019|5.0|This is a great movie, and Pacino is rivetting as Carlito Brigante, a Puerto Rican drug dealer who spent 5 years in prison and trying to reform his old ways. From the start Brigante is surrounded by former associates and 'friends' who try to pull him back to his pre-prison lifestyle. With a keen, streetwise perception, Brigante manages to stay out of harms reach, and ultimately out of the reach of the law who would like nothing better than to put him back in prison.<br /><br />So far he's been able to beat the rap with the help of his cokehead lawyer-friend David Kleinfeld (played brilliantly by Sean Penn), who looks appropriately sleazy.<br /><br />Ultimately this movie is about misplaced loyalty and the consequences of living by a code of ethics that doesn't question it's own rules.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Once upon a time, there was a metal band whose goal was to commit the most brutal songs ever heard. And one day, the result of that aim would be called 'Reign in blood'. Just a masterpiece from masters at the peak of their career. In ten (so intense) songs, Slayer released the definitive testimony of the speed/thrash-metal music style. No less. The rest is just history...
0694519928|4.0|When this book came out, I convinced myself that \\"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus\\" was just another empty-headed, catchily-titled, self-help franchise. \\"Mars/Venus\\" certainly has become a franchise, but here I am wishing I had read it years ago!<br /><br />In \\"Mars/Venus,\\" John Gray shares fascinating insights into the disparate emotional lives of men and women. In some ways, the books seems to confirm ancient stereotypes about the sexes, which makes me a bit wary. Men occasionally need to retreat to their \\"caves.\\" Women's moods oscillate for no particular reason, putting them in a \\"well.\\" Whatever the truth to these assertions, Gray's main message is that when a man understands how utterly different the female emotional experience is from his own, he might stop expecting her to react as he would, giving her the kind of love and support she *really* needs. And vice versa.<br /><br />The strength of the book lies in the strong visual images it uses to hammer home its points: the Rubber Band, the Cave, the Tornado, the Well. The section detailing the way men and women score love \\"points\\" was hilarious and eye-opening. Save the diamond necklaces fellas. You'll get as much appreciation if you take her to the movies! The book's self-help techniques were also impressive. The Love Letter, described in Chapter 11, gives women and men a safe way to express anger, sadness, fear, regret and love, and to imagine how their partner would ideally respond. The partner can be spouse, parent (past or present), self (past or present) or even the deity.<br /><br />The book's weakness is its length, repetitiveness and perhaps its lack of originality. This was especially evident in the audio version, in which charts (which might have been scanned visually in the book) had to be read in their entirety. Entire sections in the middle chapters seem to echo material from earlier in the book. Perhaps this was done deliberately to help readers grasp points by dint of sheer repetition. But there were sections in the 8-CD unabridged version that I skipped without loss of information. I'm also concerned somewhat about contentions that Gray borrowed his materials from others. But whether all ideas originate with him, I congratulate him for packaging them in a way that is understandable and helpful.<br /><br />\\"Mars/Venus\\" will expose mens' dirty little secret that we are fragile and emotional creatures. Men are fearful of many things, in Gray's on-target opinion, not least of which is rejection or lack of admiration by the woman they love. Gray also shows the logic behind the male-confounding \\"emotional\\" responses of women. Gray not only exposes the differing perspectives that men and women bring to relationships, but advises them on how to navigate the stormy seas of love. By changing the way they respond to each other, Gray hopes that men and women can get the emotional support they both crave.<br /><br />Note: At 8 CDs, the unabridged version is too long. But the abridged version is only two CDs shorter! In any case, the reader was wonderful.tion. But there were sections in the 8-CD unabridged version that I skipped without loss of information.

6305313687|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews on here for many various movies and tv adaptations here, and I think some opinions get a bit wasted.  I'll explain in a minute, first let's give a small summary. <br /> <br />Edward Norton plays Derek Vinyard, basically a co-leader of a growing and violent white supremacy group, until he lands in jail for manslaughter, and comes out a changed man.  Meanwhile, his little brother, Danny Vinyard, played excellently by Edward Furlong, is adapting his brother's ways since held him on a pedestal, and is moving down the same path.  Enriched by black and white flashbacks, and incredible emotion and superior acting by the main characters, and its supporting cast (Fairuza Balk, Ethan Suplee, Beverly D'Angelo, and Elliott Gould), AHX is a movie I'll always remember and love. <br /> <br />The acting in this movie surely makes it great.  All the characters are quite believable in their roles, and they make those roles come alive.  Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek is one of the best performances I've ever seen.  But the whole movie is about deception, power, anger, and redemption, all four on high.  Furlong, Balk, and Suplee give performances of a lifetime as well.   <br /> <br />I don't recommend this to anyone under 13, basically for its graphic violence, but I consider it necessary for a teenager to watch and learn from.  There are a lot of lessons embedded within this film, and despite the very strong language and very mature situations, I recommend this to parents and teenagers over the age of 13.  Watch this and be mesmerized by memorable performances, and highly emotional scenes.  There is a certain graphic realism, and it shouldn't be overlooked.  Enjoy!
B0000048V8|5.0|Wonderful, wonderful movie.  Watch it with someone you love.  I watch it with my mom at least once every Christmas.
B000002JPA|5.0|DT is my favorite band of all time, and their talent is simply mesmerizing.  Let's look at the cast: <br /> <br />James LaBrie - Lead Vocals, tambourine <br />John Petrucci - Lead Guitar, Rhythm Guitar <br />John Myung - Bass Guitar <br />Mike Portnoy - Drums <br />Kevin Moore - Keyboard <br /> <br />Dream Theater has a unique blend of Pink Floyd, Metallica, and Yes installed into their musical blending pot.  All the songs are truly a pleasure to listen to, but any newbies, please open your minds! <br /> <br />1.  Pull Me Under:  9/10 - A great start, and one of their more popular tunes.  The track is pretty long, and it drags a bit towards the end, but it's upbeat and very 80s ish, with their unique progressive blend thrown in. <br /> <br />2.  Another Day:  9/10 - The first ballad on the CD.  It's very radio-friendly, and very slow tempo.  Again, very 80s sounding, typical type of 80s ballad.  It's pretty straightforward and easy to listen to, especially those of you new to Dream Theater <br /> <br />3.  Take the Time:  9.5/10 - This was an interesting song, because everybody wrote their own parts to it, lyrically and musicaly, and it was all fused and mixed together here.  This is an outstanding track, in my opinion.  Great job and great lyrics. <br /> <br />4.  Surrounded:  10/10 - A great ballad, and very sweet, and serene.  Again very easy to listen to, with a nice keyboard sound and beat to it. <br /> <br />5.  Metropolis Pt. 1:  The Miracle and the Sleeper:  100/10 - One of Dream Theater's best songs ever.  The solo extravaganza around the 4 minute point, lasting until the 8 minute point is riveting, and really displays how much talent these guys have.  There are dozens of time changes, tempo changes, and instrument changes throughout.  A truly awesome track. <br /> <br />6.  Under a Glass Moon:  9.5/10 - Contains the best solo and drum exploits.  This song isn't anything special, it's just plain good.   <br /> <br />7.  Wait FOr Sleep:  8/10 - This is an ethereal sounding piano ditty.  It's short and sweet, but the words are incredible.  You'll see more and more of these type songs as you delve more and more into the Dream Theater world. <br /> <br />8.  Learning to Live:  11/10 - Ahh, the epic.  The only song on this album written solely by John Myung.  This song is very keyboard friendly, and again drags at the end, but the musical and lyrical genius cannot be ignored.  Although it drags it's an incredible song, with Kevin Moore really showing us his skillz with the boardz.   <br /> <br />Overall, a great album, and I recommend it to anyone looking to try to get into something non-mainstream and new.

0395925037|3.0|Hitler is usually described on TV as some sort of madman.  There  are currently attempts to paint him as a sexual pervert or having Parkenson's disease.  He was not a madman.  His ideas were part of the currency of the time.  In his \\"History of The World\\" H.G. Wells discusses the atttempt to bring the world under a \\"firm Jewish heel\\".  It is interesting that Wells takes this as an obvious fact, not out-of-the-blue speculation.  Hitler came to the same conclusion.  His initial hatred for Jews  was not theoretical, but based on his observations or taking as fact that Jews ran brothels in Vienna where the sexual favors of German girls were sold to all interested.  His reaction apppears similar to what a traditionalist White Southerner might think on seeing Howard Stern on TV today.  It is unclear if Hitler was aware of Oswald Spengler's view that the German loss of WW I was the first great step in the downfall of Western Civilization to the \\"colored world\\" (Spengler's words)  and that the \\"next war\\" would determine if Western Civilization survied or died.  Hitler's views are far from insane; they in many ways seem the product of a logic machine.  \\"X\\" is happening; \\"Y\\" is promoting \\"X\\"; \\"X\\" is not desired, therefore  eliminate \\"Y\\".  Exactly the same logic exists today, but \\"X\\" is the destruction of European man and \\"Y\\" is the forces   creating \\"X\\" and \\"X\\" is desired, therefore \\"Y\\" is promoted.      It is evident that Hitler's hatred for Jews was not based upon any sort of theology, but upon their more-or-less generally perceived negative impact upon the Western World in general and upon Germany in particular. If the Jews had been any other peoples having the same perceived impact, Hitler would have felt the same about them.  This is evident by his dislike for France, based upon his perception, stated in Mein Kampf, that that country would be a Negro state in several hundred years and that France had put Negros on the Rhine. Perhaps the greatest difference between Hitlerand conventional politicians is that Hitler though more of the future than the immediate, as he said in the context of the 1938 pact with Stalin.  Hitler appears to have had a fair knowledge of Judaism.  He once said that Judaism is not a religion, but a philosophy.  Einstein said almost the same thing.  Interestingly, Herman Cohen said that to be a religion a system had to be true, in the scientific sense, not \\"I know\\" when \\"I believe strongly\\" is meant,  As any casual student of TANACH and Talmud knows, Jewish ethics are based upon the notion that whatever is in the long term interest of the Jewish people, as centuries go by, is a positive good and sin is anything which acts against this end.  The reversal of values in America is an astounding exhibit of the power of tightly controlled propaganda.  As a whole the European population of the US has become convinced that caring about the future is a positive evil and not caring is a positive good.  Judge Learned Hand (the 12th member of the Supreme Court) wrote many years ago that control over the great newspapers and magazines constitutes the real government of the United States.  Today TV and motion pictures would be in first place as influence.  The anti-European programming on TV has become standard.  An interesting directly political case showing this control is the now dead \\"Fairness Doctrin\\" of the FCC about 30 years ago.  The doctrin was that TV stations having ads for political candidates had to accept ads of all political candidates.  The controllers of TV at the time went to the federal courts, where the Supreme Court ruled the doctrin constitutional.  So the controllers had the heart of the doctrin cut out by the FCC itself.  The objection was, of course, that it partially created a free press in the US.  Now the term \\"right wing\\" means harmless radio and TV opinion programs where serious discussion is never found.  The European population of the US (and of much of Western Europe) has with exceptions ofcourse been induced to give up their self-respect. The US government has been influenced by this same mentality of low self-respect.  It should be obvious that a people who lack self-respect will find themselves attacked externally.  Judaism to some degree defines itself in terms of enemies.  This seems obvious- to be Chosen necessitates that the \\"other\\" is non-chosen and inferior, \\"the evil ones\\" as RAMBAM calls them.   The introduction of Kantian ethics into modern commentaries on TANACH appears to be a conscious attempt to reduce the notion that the non-chosen are valueless to God.  This is a moving away from Rabbi Akiba's argument that God cared only for Jews, because Jews are circumcised, which is to God as a uniform is to the king, and as the king loves his own soldiers and recognizes them by their uniforms, so God knows and loves his chosen and not the non-chosen.      When you read Mein Kampf remember that it is a political argument trying to attract and maintain support, not a scientific analysis.  We are today fully familiar with half truths and statements quoted out of context and similar devices   used by American political figures to attract support for themselves or this or that program.  Hitler did much the same thing.  In one almost universal practice of national governments  Hitler's book is a bit stupid; it is a stupidity widely shared.  In addition to being a statement of his views, Mein Kampf is also a policy statement, though it was written long before he had governmental authority.  National governments have a great bias for establishing and then following policy without due re-examination.  Hitler did just that.  He established policy and he followed it somewhat blindly with little regard to the flux of circumstance.  In many ways it may be said that he had little understanding of the impacts policy, once established, carried out would have upon Germany.  He was making policy beyond his understanding; a common fault at the national governmentlevel, where policy makers seldom really understand the varient effects of policy carried out.  He put what he perceived as the national good above the welfare or even survival of the individual.  That is a common mindset of political and other leaders.  Maimonides in M-Torah says that   a person should let himself die rather than be treated by an apostate physician, clearly a bias for the long-term good of the people over the survival of the individual.  It seems pretty clear that Hitler judged the accomplishment of his aims  to be limited by personal leadership with institutionalized continuation rather than by a rule-following institution, thus he saw the realization of the principal aims as having to be accomplished by him individually.  This limitation was his great weakness.      As far as reading is concerned, Mein Kampf is of interest only because it is by Hitler.  Obviously, a student of the period should read it.      There was an overwhelming change in World history produced by the destruction of Germany by the US, UK and Russia that is far greater than any historical event in thousands of years.  It does not mean a change of colors on a map; it means fundamental, permanent change in the nature of man at the biological level.  Most past European wars had meant little more than which prince peasants would pay taxes to or perhaps whether they would have some sort of representation at most.  Hitler's book should be read with the understanding of what he saw at stake: The fundamental nature of European man for all time.  He was willing to do anything to protect it.     It is of some interest that Hitler does not mean by the word \\"race\\" the classifications used by physical anthropologists such as Carlton Coon, who put man into five biologic divisions, with mixed persons not fitting into any of the five. (Caucazoid, Mongoloid, Congoid, Capoid and Australioid)  Hitler uses the term to mean any of very many groups, thus he says that the only surviving pure race will be the \\"Jewish race\\".  The translation given a German newspaper of the Hitler period is \\"Racial Observer\\".  The German is \\"Volklisher Beobacer\\" which does not mean racial observer, but something more akin to \\"Popular Observer\\" or more loosly \\"National Observer\\".
6301969588|5.0|A group of sideshow people plan out their revenge on a woman who seduced and got one of the midgets in the show to marry her, only to go after his fortune. One of the only films that really truly frightened me, this film is both a sad and scary motion picture; a lost classic if you ask not only me, but almost every other reviewer. Banned in the UK because of the thematic subject matter involving the sideshow \\"freaks,\\" FREAKS is a perfect horror film. It's a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Perfect. HIGHLY recommended!!!
6305078564|5.0|The movie Pride and Prejudice is a remarkable and wonderful film that opens your eyes to the late 18th Century's societal values.  The film stays true to the book and wins the viewers through a stunning actress, Jennifer Ehle and an incredibly handsome actor, Colin Firth.  You can not hope that the two enemies reconcile their differences and open themselves to the possibility of love and friendship in one another.
