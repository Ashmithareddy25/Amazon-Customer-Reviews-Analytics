B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Although very different from the book as Fanny actually exposing her personality at times and the story of the slaves being abused by Sir Thomas not happening at all in the book, the movie is an enjoyable experience (so good, actually, I've seen it several times). I love how aunt Norris, Fanny, lady Bertram and Edmund are played. Maybe I'm not very judgemental, but for those not expecting a masterpiece, but a good past time, very worth having a copy.
B001P9KR94|4.0|I love this movie from the first time I saw it.  The look and sound of the disc are amazingly great on this Blu-Ray.
B00689J512|3.0|This album was different by far from her previous body of work, which doesn't necessarily bother me. What did bother me was the length of many of the songs: several could have benefited from an additional verse- they were so short and seemed rushed. That being said, there are lots of fun club-style songs in this album and it's just fun. I prefer deeper songs but this one does explore interesting issues.
1451627289|5.0|With the JFK assassination serving as the center point of this novel, King crafts a meticulously plotted story of love, society, and history, that is so beautiful the nearly 900 pages fly by and leave you wanting even more. While the ending of his last lengthy novel, Under The Dome, came under some scrutiny (and I'll admit, as a long time King fan, it wasn't his best), the ending of 11/22/63 can only be described as perfect. This book grabs you instantly and never lets you go. A masterpiece of fiction.
B000641Z90|5.0|Some great bands are a big disappointment live, others are a wonderful surprise. This Phil Collins is one of the happy surprises, what an amazing live performer he is, this concert is spectacular. No complaints about picture or sound quality, and all the hits are here. This was a gift for my husband, it is his favorite concert DVD.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|I'm not French, so I am sure that some of the comedic nuances may have been lost on me.  Such is the case when one watches foreign films, sometimes.  Nevertheless, this movie was subtle and clever:  qualities the American version was completely devoid of.  It's worth watching just for some of the facial expressions alone.  Of course, as in all films, you've got to suspend your disbelief a little.  And it helps to know a bit about the French, I suppose.  But even without that, it's a pretty straight-forward story, cleverly shot and written.  A good French farce.  Don't let the subtitles scare you away.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I received a wonderful tip from my sister that Amazon had this DVD on sale. Since I loved the movie after seeing it a few years back with my son around the Holidays, I was sure it would be prefect to get for him to start a wonderful Holiday tradition of watching this together.  It is such great story and who doesn't love Tom Hanks?!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I loved this movie, and am sitting down to watch it again, right now.  I urge all people who this movie is \\"for\\" (- and that is not everyone) to Google and read the passage of \\"Job 38\\" before viewing, or a repeated viewing.  It's a beautiful passage, no matter your religious beliefs, and really explicates the \\"Cosmos\\" scenes in this Masterpiece of a film.  I know I will be viewing this film for years, as its impact - like \\"Wild Strawberries\\" is apt to change as \\"we\\" age.  The film hasn't changed.    We have....
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|I really like Lady A.  I am not a big fan of country music but their music is a combination of both rock and country.  As I get older I like music that is a little laid back but not sleeping and this is not.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Like all the other Transformer movies just great, one you can play over  and over and never get sick of seeing it.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I bought Part 1 of this movie a year ago with digital copy so I could add it to my digital library for the kids iPods and iPads and stream it over my home network.  I didn't think twice about buying Part 2 with digital copy.  Now I wish I'd paid more attention.  Ultraviolet doesn't let you 'own' a copy of the movie, rather you're allowed to stream it, if your devices support that.  After I've already put in apple TV's throughout my house that's not an option.  What a waste of money.  I guess I won't be buying anymore 3d blu rays with digital copy.  From here on out I'll just make my buys straight from the ITunes store and not worry about the 3d/Blu-ray/DVD copies.  We only needed the DVD copy for the kids to watch on the go, and only bought 3D thinking we might upgrade the players at some point, but that's not going to happen now.  Oh well, life goes on I guess.
0307891402|2.0|The fantastic detail and comprehensiveness is perfect for OCD D&D enthusiasts, as noted by other reviewers.  The most popular 5 star review declares this is a book \\"built to last\\".  Regrettably, mine arrived with such poor production that opening it caused thin, fragile pages which were glued together to tear like cobwebs.    Some of the game informational material is cryptic, such as notes and information given with asterisks, daggers, etc., with no obvious footnote location.  Perhaps these marks mean something else in that section, but I was unable to find and answer in the chapter intro, end, section, or the first place I looked: the bottom of the page.  The table of contents and index were also checked.  Because of the non-linear nature of the pages and extremely small text such searching is non-trivial.  Another example: What do bracketed numbers such as \\"[5/15]\\" or \\"[28/3]\\" mean, and how do I locate the legend?  While the standard version typeface could have been clear and easily read, this potential is destroyed by marginal paper stock which bleeds too much from the other side, poorly contrasting (presumably cheap) ink, use of textured gray backgrounds, and the incomprehensible selection of very small size for condensed lettering combines to make reading frustratingly difficult.  The cover of my book had multiple glue streaks on the back, photos of some of the defects, including endpaper & glue disasters with the binding are posted.  Other owners have complained of tens of missing pages, although this does not appear to be the case with mine.  Prima should speak with the printer, and perhaps customers as well.  I hope the publisher puts up a web version, although merely a searchable PDF would be a big help, especially for figuring out cryptic stats and footnote marks.  I would love to be able to just search for the first use of \\"[\\".  Update: My opinion of the usefulness of the book is declining.  I made the mistake of maxing out Stealth by sneaking against arock near some giants, making my character look (on average) to the system much as a much stronger adventurer.  After brutally long cycles of: Sneak Attack, Run-Run-Run out of enemy range, (Atronoch decoys were dying with 1 or 2 hits), and repeating by creeping up for another sneak attack, I decided an enchanted bow was going to be a necessity.  In the index, I went to look for help obtaining enchanted items.  There is nothing actionable in any of the three relevant entries, entitled: \\"Enchanting, Enchantments, or Enchantment Modifiers\\".  Not a word in these actually seems of use in helping the adventurer obtain a specific enchantment ability above and beyond what is in the game.  Its nice to know the numerical value of percentage coefficients to be multiplied for a mathematical comparison of enchantments, but it doesn't really help a user avoid spending nearly an hour  6 or 7 tries at running for my life from a Dwarven Sphere Master who outclasses me by so much.  Yes: I know maxing stealth was an error - but this does not exonerate a game guide from providing, well, game guidance; This is especially true when so much space is devoted to useless content like 120 different illustrations of random characters, just in Section I: Training, Part II: Racial Advantages.    Hoping to get help back at Winterhold College enchanting a bow, I triggered an attack on Winterhold.  I'm now getting slaughtered by magical \\"creatures infesting Winterhold\\", and I'm drained of magicka in the battle.  My next attempt to get help is to learn how to activate my Altmer power to recharge.  Unfortunately, there is no entry for \\"Power Use\\" or \\"Power\\" in the index.  \\"Altmer\\" is referenced in 3 places: p.7: a description of high elves, p.199: a list of fence characters for stolen goods, and p.229: a walkthrough of a minor side-quest called Summerset Shadows.  \\"Racial Powers\\" (p.5-6) have chatty discussions of differences between races, with spreadsheets, but no help there.  Nothing under the \\"High Elf\\" description in this section is helpful for using the Altmer's Power, except perhaps the cruelly ironic: \\"this Power is a mage's lifeline\\".  Ha!  Apparently, I'm just going to die now...since accessing this lifeline is more trouble to find than slogging on...and bumping my review down to 2 stars. Checking the keyboard controls in the game shows Z activates the Power as well as Shouts.   In the \\"Containment\\" mini-quest above, I was being attacked by \\"Magic Anomalies\\", neither of which appear in the index.  After defeating them (with no help from the Guide) I thought perhaps my expectations were too high, but in the advertising, we read: \\"Every type of combat is tactically analyzed, so you can better any foe in battle.\\" Perhaps these are buried in the 600 pages of spreadsheets and screenshots of randomly generated adventurers. Update: Eventually, I did find this quest under the \\"College of Winterhold\\" section.  When I defeated the final anomaly and went to speak with Mirabelle, she informed me that I was expelled from the College, and refused to speak with me.  There is no mention of this possibility in the walkthrough, and the journal will not update.    Honestly, if I wanted to get expelled, seem radioactive to women, and pay lots of money for an inability to get a straight answer even with gigantic texts, I'd enroll as an undergrad in the real world...
B0068TJLSY|1.0|Save Your $3.99.  There is a reason that there is a Facebook page called \\"Super 8 Is The Worst Movie Ever.  I rented this thinking it was a Steven King movie.  Instead I got Stand By Me, Meets ET and District 9.  Totally predictable and uninteresting.
B005V20JKI|5.0|I was skeptical a game with a d-pad on a touch screen could play this well. Kudos to the developers! You pulled itoff in spades.  Also, if you like Super Crate Box pick this up. You won't be upset.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|It is almost embarrassing to herald how much of a genius Kate Bush is, these days. Because it seems to be so much of a shared trend, almost an obligation. So would there be any consensual facile blindness there? Or do we just have to surrender to the evidence of a case of a musician whose talent is so unquestionable that every single soul has to admit that yes, Kate Bush is a genius? Well, that being said as a preamble, yes, a billion times yes, we'll have to get used to being embarrassed, because once again, these Fifty Words For Snow are exceptionally grandiose, and yes, they do confirm Mrs. Bush's genius.  In this new delivery, Bush is baffling, creative and appealing, mysterious and slow, and this record, while remaining highly (and fortunately), some \\"instantly pure Kate Bush\\", is somewhat different to her previous album in terms of its intentions, slowly unfolding its hidden seductions in convoluted and elongated compositions, such as the winter light that never ceases to die beyond the skyline laced with skeletons of black trees. Some will probably esteem that this philosophy of lengthy and elongated compositions represent, in fact, the problem here :  \\"Far too stretched\\" ... They would be wrong, \\"Fifty Words for Snow\\" is anything but padding.  Bush will mischievously disorient more than one, primarily, with her \\"Snowflake\\" introduction track. The listener, discovering the new Kate Bush album, expects to be taken by the bewitching voice of the Magician from the Land of the LionHeart, but in place it is Kate's offspring in the person of Bertie who opens the disc (Albert MacIntosh was already acting as a somewhat \\"computerized\\" voice in Bush's previous album \\"Director's Cut\\", so the use of her son's voice here is not a whim or a fad, but a true policy, and a continuation). Unprepared and unaware though as he might be, the listener will wonder at first, imagining a mutation, or a cold snap on Bush's throat? But the chorus of the mother, with discreet punctuations binding and growing throughout the song, come quickly reassuring: yes, we shall be buried under meters of snow as well as of the musical talent of Mrs. Bush.  Those who still long for the return of a more baroque Kate Bush, experimental and weird in her gestures and mannerisms or research of sounds for the mere sake of being weird and \\"different\\" (of course, Kate Bush never was \\"weird\\" for the sake of being so -in contrast to the musical strategy and attitudes of some Icelandic avatar whose name we shall not mention here, by charity-, even though it happened in the past that Bush was accused of that, namely in the French Press, and obviously not by those who favoured in this art of hers its most expressionist facets, and no matter what, did not like her enough to measure, beyond the seductions of breaking glass sounds and atmospheric screams, the serenity and the depth of a unique composer's talent that time has magnified), thus those who still hope for an hysterical Kate Bush because they see there a synonymous with creativity should better jump aboard the next snowplow and go elsewhere, because there is nothing extravagant by calculation or by posture in this white symphony exploring the fifty Eskimo words to name snow.  Nor is there anything here which radios could rush on (except, perhaps, the fourth track, \\"Wild Man\\", chosen as the spokesman for this record as its potential \\"single\\", a track that some compassionate souls have already criticized for sounding like \\"Experiment IV\\", meaning:  ...Yes, yes, Kate Bush has nothing left to say, the proof is that she repeats herself. Hum hum. Not really. Or then, long live the stuttering if it has to prove so inspired and wonderful!... In fact, if one were to engage in the hunt of similarities between this and that, it is not \\"Wild Man\\" that should be addressed. And it is elsewhere than into Kate Bush's work that one should pick to go, as there is undoubtedly some coincidental convergence between the introductory notesof \\"Misty\\" and those of 1989 Sinéad O'Connor's \\"You Cause So Much Sorrow \\", although both compositions quickly branch off in opposite directions.  This being said, it does not prevent \\"Misty\\" to easily win the title of best track on the album, because of its density and the complexity and splendour of music there, but also for the many meanings behind the narrative theme, alternately tender, poetic, oniric, allusive, melancholic -or provokingly double-meaning: the romance of a woman with a snowman makes Bush whispers, in a breath where erotic greed vies with nostalgia, that she can \\"feel him melting in her hand\\", at the end of their carnal frolics in soaking sheets...  The \\"Fifty Words for Snow\\" album lasts more than an hour of listening, however, it is only composed of six long chants (I exclude from this accounting the incantatory \\"Wild Man\\" already quoted, which is the seventh wonder of the disk, for the reason of its structure, which is somewhat apart from the rest). Praise of languor, praise of Time that snows and absorbs you, a general mood that shows the wonderful consistency of a complete artist and an exceptional performer, through seven pieces around which the voice of Bush, intact in its nuances and absolutely beautiful in its newest lower registers, spirals and charms our ears and heart.  But let's be no mistaking.  \\"Fifty Words for Snow\\" is not a languid or sluggish effort, it does not cause drowsiness, the rhythms of the title track of the album are there to confirm it is a work that shakes and surprises ; each listening brings its own new set of findings, and the disorienting duet with Elton John (sorry, Sir Elton John) is no exception to this rule, a quite moving piece in more ways than one, because of its theme on one hand, but also because it shows us that Kate Bush remembers who she is.  That is, an author who (in deference, by reference, for the sake of love, for a sense of wonder still intact, and because she belongs to a generation still gifted with memory and devoid of this frivolous bulimia of consumption that is our contemporary fate, with, as a result, most people burning what they adored five minutes earlier), thus an author who has decided to pay tribute to the one whose compositions and unique talent used to drive her \\"mad with ecstasy but also jealousy\\", as she once declared she felt about Elton John at the beginning of the decade 70's, where music was going to make her become, all of a sudden in 1978, the incomparable Kate Bush of  \\"The Kick Inside\\".   She would notably mention, when interviewed and mentioning her thoughts about the author of \\"Your Song\\", \\"Empty Garden\\" and \\"Ticking\\" (between other gems !...), one of the English musician and composer's most indisputable masterpieces, the unsurpassable \\" Madman Across the Water \\".  It therefore became logical that The Mad Woman Across The Snow, in this \\"duet\\" on \\"Snowed in at Wheeler Street\\", called in the star that shone in the firmament of the epoch when she was born.  And even if, today, Cathy does not gesticulate anymore in videos/happenings/phenomena, the Sorcerer with red shoes and Sir Elton John, knighted by the Queen -with him in the role of some Heathcliff whom Time would have gifted with the deep voice that suits to despair-, move us to tears when they both confess to each other that \\"I never want to lose you -again\\".  The theme of this piece is particularly poignant:  A story of love reincarnated over thousands of years where the lovers embrace each other until death separates them ; a love that falls and breaks with Rome and then stumble under the ruins of the World Trade Center. The Eternal Return, a theme tailored for Bush par excellence. A theme that haunts, of course, Tony Scott's \\"The Hunger\\", but above all and especially Mankiewicz's wonderful masterpiece \\"The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,\\" a film in which the role played then by Gene Tierney could  have been written especially for Kate Bush, a story of a reclusive, daydreaming and rebellious woman in love with a sailor deceased, both losing and losing and losing each other, before finally meeting for good in the eternal life, beyond Death that here plays a friendly role that units and does not separate ; and finally Mervyn Le Roy's \\"Waterloo Bridge\\", where Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor love each other only for being better torn apart and losing each other again, and again - another masterpiece of the cinema before the war, where London disappears in the mist, rain and snow, in a frame and atmospheres so synergistic with this duet of impossible love between two immense artists, singers, writers and composers such as  Bush and John, both proudly claiming to be son and daughter of Albion, and both so passionately British in their taste for exacerbated romance. A key notion if one wishes to understand the raison d'être of this composition, and why Kate Bush asked Sir Elton John to accompany her in this story of a lost love.  The last track, \\"Among Angels\\", is certainly the one that will delight all those who fell madly in love with \\"Aerial\\" -and particularly its jewel, \\"A Coral Room\\". If only for this piece, these fifty variations on a snowflake, condensed into seven snowdrops falling where none would expect them -Kate Bush unpredictable creativity at its best-, is worth the trip.  \\"Fifty Words for Snow\\" is a work that needs to be tamed. It will not unfold its secrets at first listening -but, anyway, did any of Kate Bush's previous efforts ever did so?  No matter what, it truly is an amazing album.  Of compositions.  Not of songs.  Personally, I know now that this album, after many listening, is as beautiful and magical as \\"Arial\\" proved to be, as hypnotic as any of its predecessors, among the most prestigious and creative ones.  In short, it is undoubtedly some \\"top Kate Bush\\" (sorry for my English, this is the way we would say it in French)... And finally, it may be quite sufficient as a comment!   Well, it probably could, but who could resist the temptation to say how fascinating Kate Bush's work is! One only wishes others to be in turn swept away by this avalanche of talent and inspiration, swallowed by Mrs. Bush's snowfalls, falls that will provide the full range of emotions of a meteoric rise -and will leave you there, dazzled and bewildered, at the top of the world.  Where, undoubtedly, Kate Bush will be waiting for you, in the snowy company of some local Wild Man.  For this is where legends live.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|this was a good movie you should watch it !!! i bought it at a good price.hope they make another movie like this
B000BWNW34|4.0|I am an avid reader so I was happy and amazed that an Easton Press book was up for a cheap price. It was in perfect condition, and came early. It now proudly sits in my bookshelf and amazes my friends and family when they see it. Thank you.

0451232577|5.0|Follett writes a novel that surveys four cultures before, during, and after World War I.  As a history buff, World War I has never caught my attention, but Follett presents the US, British, German, and Russian societies with both the elites and the common people, and shows the effect of the coming war on each one, with all of the interlacing that exists.  His presentation of the anti-war arguments of each country clears up any misconceptions that the citizens of the other countries solidly supported the war while America was dithering.  There is a political slant to Fall of Giants, but people with knowledge of history can detect and account for it.  All three of the European countries are dramatically changed by 1924, and the US has its own dramatic change, from an observer of world affairs, to a world power.
030788743X|4.0|Ernest Cline's story of a massive online world is reminiscent of such ideas as Tron, where there is an entire world in the circuits. He provides a great storyline with funny and nostalgic references from the beginnings of video games and geeks. However, the story can lack substance at some parts, where it becomes hard to imagine the things being described and at times the writing is just a bit amateur. However, imagining the things being described could be hard due to the fact that most of the things are from the pure imagination of Cline. The book also felt like it was on the verge of being more young adult. I found myself imagining it as a kids movie, and then I would read the occasional bad word and rememeber that it was written for adults. Overall, the book is a wonderful ride for any geek or pop culture fanatic of the early geek days. The writing style can get amateur at times, but the overall epicness and fun of the story will keep you going to the end.
0061537969|5.0|Through all the heartbreak, Enzo gives the story the viewpoint most of us never think about.  Now I know what my beloved eleven-year old Aussie must be thinking!

0321127420|4.0|I found this book really complete about the issues an enterprise application may encounter. It describes problems and solutions very clearly. The only thing I regret is not to find creation-oriented patterns that may also be usefull in enterprise architecture management. (such as Singleton, Abstract Factory and so on).  You'll need some development-oriented vocabulary if you're not used to reading such books, but it's quite well written for people that doesn't read and understand english fluently.

B001UU75WK|5.0|The pilot episode of Fringe is one of the best pilots of any show I've ever seen. I had seen it before, but I had to buy it to have whenever I want. It's so creative and exciting, the acting is top-notch, and it makes you think. The characters are actually intelligent. You don't feel the need to yell at them not to be so stupid like you do with most TV shows. It's one of the best!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|At the original price of $39.99, this case is definitely on the expensive side. However, at the new price of $29.99, it is more reasonable. The case is of a high quality, made from high quality plastics with a rubberised texture on the back, The Kindle Fire snaps easily onto place and stays there securely, and is also easily removed.  Despite what other reviews say, the front cover is definitely not made of cardboard, it is a decent piece of (very thin) plastic covered by a rubberised material on the front, and a felt-lkke material on the back.  The stand function does work, however, the surface must be a flat and hard one, otherwise chances are that it will fall over.   Overall, this is a great case for the Kindle Fire and oozes of quality, however, I am only giving it 4 stars due to the price. if it were priced in the region on $20-$25, I would gave no hesitation recommending this high quality case to anyone.
B00005YJMX|5.0|The original Nosferatu has to be the best vampire movie ever made. When I purchased this, I was disappointed that I wasn't getting the original but decided to take the chance. I was delighted with this remake. It stuck to the script exactly as the original & the only difference was that there was speaking in it. They made the characters up to look like the original characters. It was in color (the original was black & white) but that didn't deter from the creepiness of the movie. The color was in a blue hue so everything was darker. This was a great Halloween movie that didn't disappoint at all. Actually, it was the first remake I ever liked!
1451648537|5.0|This was a thoroughly fascinating book. Isaacson clearly understood Steve Jobs. He presented the facts in an unbiased fashion. He allowed the reader to form his own opinion. I think it is important to know about Steve Jobs...his impact on our world was huge.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. This entire series was really good and I couldn't finish one without having the next ready to read.
1451648537|5.0|The book is amazing!  I like the book because there is no fluff.  Steve Jobs was a \\"tell it like it is\\"   kind of man.  Even though most of us don't run a company like Apple, I think everyone will find the book (the life of Jobs) somewhat relatable.  I sure did!  Steve Jobs IS the Ralph Lauren of electronics.  A very inspiring book!
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|Cinematography was superb. Exactly the quality you expect from Spielberg and Abrams. It reminded me of Cloverfield, E.T., and The Goonies all rolled into one. The kids were excellent actors.  However, once you reach the end of the film you feel as though you missed something somewhere, as though this film was part 2 of a 2-part film. Something was greatly lacking in the story. In E.T. for example, the alien and the boy slowly build a relationship so that you feel for them in their emotional parting. But in the case of Super8, the alien and boy are total strangers but behave as though they had built some wonderful relationship between them. The boy seemed to have discovered something endearing about the alien that the audience is not privy to and is unrealistically brave and devoid of fear when put face to face with a nightmarish creature that hardened military men feared. As the alien sailed away in his spaceship, all I could think was, \\"Farewell... who ever you were...\\".
B003Y5H57E|1.0|I liked the movie, but can't support this version until they include a true digital copy.  Ultraviolet is not the digital copy we've all been expecting.
0385535139|1.0|IMO the book didn't really make sense.  It bordered on trying to be cute and then it went serious, back to cute and then just plain silly.  Way below his usual standards.  If this were the first book I had read by him, I would not buy another one.

B0060V1WJ6|3.0|I don't mind when movies are loud.  But that doesn't mean I don't get stressed out when I have to watch obnoxiously loud movies with people (women) who don't like loud movies.  This movie needs to be watched on TV speakers... if you dare watch it on a stereo system, you will be unexpectedly bombasted with thumping unbalanced uncompressed club music in which every 2nd goddamned scene in this movie's first act takes place in.  It's like when you watch TV and then the commercial breaks are illegally 5x as loud.  This isn't an action movie, so why is the audio mixed like one?  P.S.  The movie is semi-decent and is oriented towards bored women and their docile husbands/boyfriends who can tolerate the material.

B002NEFL8W|5.0|Great grip that completes my Canon 7D.  I have always used grip on my 39D and 40D and found that the extra weight it gives the camera does nothing but enhance the photo expericnce.  Having twice the battery power and having the ability to use vertically are a plus.  The 7D and other great Canon cameras all fit my hand, but, with the grip it fits better, it gives me a more secure feel, all that enhance my ability to take great photos.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Sound quality isn´t that good. I´ve expected a little more.  Wireless is the better part of it, and battery is really good.  I think is OK for the price
B004LUS390|5.0|First off.. I have sketchbook on my pc, my galaxy s 4g, and now on my iconia tablet, and im very impressed with all of them. I havent done art in over 10 yrs and these programs have given me brand new inspiration. Now the thing I notice about the bad reviews is they are all tablets. Sketchbook mobile is not formatted for tablets. Thats why it has bugs. What you have to get for tablets is \\"sketchbook pro\\" which is a little more than the mobile version at 5 bucks. plus they just released an update for it this week ( bout time ). So if your firmiliar with the ipad version it has all the brushes and features the ipad has. With that said autodesk has made the best app hands down in any category, its the reason I bought a tablet....Best Barber Alive.... Out!

Powerful reading for anyone who has suffered adversity. but especially those who have suffered abuse.  I particularly appreciated her honesty about her ongoing recovery.  Her survival is a triumph of uncommon resiliance and bravery.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved this book and can't wait for the next volume. Set at the end of the nineteenth century and taking the reader forward to the late days of WWI, it follows several families and characters in different countries through the dying days of imperialistic Europe. Class ideology. feminism, militarism and emerging politics clash and merge in new ways. I enjoyed it tremendously.
B00275EGWY|1.0|The one thing I really have an annoyance over with this film, which caused me to audibly groan as it happened - was the depiction of British SAS or Spec Forces as incompetent, irresponsible and reckless cowboys. Let me set the scene, which rang so untrue as to ruin the entire movie for me.  The 3 member bomb team just stumble across a stranded SAS team in the desert, the SAS team have two prisoners and have a flat tire. Apparently, the SAS team are stranded because they need to change a tire and have \\"used up their wrench.\\"   1 - A British person would never use the word wrench for tire iron.  The British SAS fella then says they used it up because the bloke changing the tire \\"threw it at somebody!\\" GIVE ME A BREAK! Does anybody believe for a minute that a professional crew of SAS with 2 important prisoners, would recklessly throw a tire iron at another member of the crew and thus make their situation worse by losing it that way? NO, NO, NO, NO!  This depiction of the SAS/Mercs at this early stage is not only beyond moronic, it is patronizing and utterly unbelievable. Whoever the technical advisers were on this movie require being left in a room with a member of the REAL SAS for a few hours. Guess what happens next?  So next, there appears a sniper on the scene and the two groups come under fire. The leader of the SAS team calls for the Barret sniper rifle, but his handling of it and his placement deliberately serve to show his total incompetence and lack of field craft with this weapon. Not only does he fail to have a spotter but he also places himself clearly in view of the enemy sniper ... and guess what folks ... as you would expect from someone doing this, he is shot and killed!  But then ... guess who slides in to save the day? The 3 man Marine crew .... and they take up the same stupid position the SAS guy took up, but this time the enemy sniper decided he won't fire on the Marines until they have spotted him and can kill him. So what this scene is tellingthe audience is that stock standard Marines are smarter than British Spec Forces and better soldiers. HILARIOUS!  What the scene tells me is that the director and producer of this film are complete IDIOTS! No SAS crew would do what this film depicts and these film makers clearly have no idea who the SAS are and what they are about. This film is moronic at best. This is Military DISNEY!

0446563048|3.0|After having read 3/5 of the book, the only takeaway I learned is that Hsieh values customer service and believes that the workplace should be your second home.  The book is literally strewn with the words \\"culture\\" and \\"community,\\" which was obviously important to the growth of the Zappos company, but Hsieh overstates his point and irritates his reader.  There is one part of the book where he talks about Zappo's start-up phase and how he hired a company called eLogistics to handle his warehouse orders, but he learned that he needed to commandeer the important aspects of the company (shipping the shoes).  In short, I really felt like Hsieh robbed my time.  The first 1/3 of the book is all you need to read to understand what Hsieh is trying to say.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|This DVD was long, but a well written saga of conflicts seen from both sides.  The extra DVDs gave a wonderful explanation of the development of the movie.  This gave great insights as to the how and why of the movie.  I will enjoy viewing it again later.

I own the DVD and Blu-ray, and the first thing I noticed with the blu-ray version is that the deleted scenes were... well, deleted. Maybe I missed it in some menu somewhere, but once you know the deleted scenes, its quite annoying when they aren't there. The picture quality is ok and doesn't seem that much better than the upconverted DVD.
1582701709|4.0|It has been known by a select few since ancient times, they were the ones in power and they wanted to stay in power. So they kept the secret to themselves. Through out the ages various people like Leonardo DaVinci, Henry Ford, Abraham Lincoln and Einstein have all known about the secret. Yet they kept it to themselves.<br /><br />Rhonda Byrne was facing some life changing difficulties and thing were falling apart until she discovered the secret. The Secret is called the \\"Law of Attraction\\" kn own by a select few sionce ancient times. I have difficulty with that statement because I remember reading a booked called \\" Creative Visualization\\" by Shakti Gawain back when I was in high school. So the secret was out even back then. There was also the Silva Mind control method even then which basically said the same thing.<br />Aleister Crowley the famous occultist said this much himself \\"thought are things\\" Every time you think is a magical action. Crowley also taught that we are gods in the making. We are stars.<br /><br />The law of attraction states that what you think or hold in your mind comes to fruition in your life. Think about success and you will achieve success. Think about finding 100 dollars lying on the floor you will find it. This in reality is true especially if you believe in the \\"Law of Attraction\\" The Law of Attraction is no secret and the concept has been taught or available to the masses for a while now. Yet \\"Creative Visualizion\\" came out years ago and people need to have their memory refreshed especially the  younger generation that has never hear of the \\"Law of Attraction\\" They need this book.<br /><br />To the experience metaphysician or spiritualist this may seem a shallow treatment that lacks depth. Yet my wife who has never heard of the \\"Law of Attraction\\" was sold on it. The infection spread and so I advise reading it. The book has input from some great people like John Assaraf, a multi millinaire tycoon, Beckwith and other great authors also have input. The book is filled with stories and anecdotes of people using the \\"Law of Attraction\\" and achieving success. There is great input and great resources for further learning. This has started a journey.<br /><br />Now some of us are into our own religions, some are into Magick and want to achieve results. This book while it is not an end all, will jump start your process.

B004G6009U|3.0|This was a good movie, but some parts were a bit annoying.   1. The horse (an animal) played a HUGE role in a movie that quite frankly, wasn't suppose to be about animals.   2. Her memory is a little too good for a baby.   3. Her \\"powers\\" are so biased.  Anyway, its an animated movie with a lot of \\"unbelievable\\" things so go figure. Its a good movie, just not a memorable one. I tend to enjoy and collect great animated movies, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, etc. Sadly, this was a good movie to watch, but not worthy of collecting.
0465043577|4.0|Mandlebrot shows just how ludicrous some of the over-simplified assumptions from statistics and probability are  and how they can lead to very wrong strategies and results.  I became so obsessed, I had to get out my statistics/probability text-book from so many years ago, I hate to  quantify it, and actually calculate the kurtosis and skew of my personal portfolios based on return of each  position. The most complicated had 127 positions.  For the 127 position portfolio, I had a Kurtosis of 10.36 and a Skew of 3.00. Since the Skew is NOT even close to zero, I can't model with either a Normal or Student-T or even a Cauchy. Only thing, I can figure with a severely upward skewed and fat tailed distribution as mine, is to try the Gumbel, Fréchet and Weibull families of distributions.   From Mandlebrot and Taleb, it is clear that you only need to find one instance where the models are inapplicable  and break down to show the weakness and brittleness of the assumptions, and why there still needs to be so much  more work done in the models we have to truly represent the results possible in the real world.  My 127 position portfolio is one such instance. Mandlebrot's cotton prices are another, and I'm sure there are  still many more.  The only really critical thing I have to say about the text, is that I would have liked more explanation of how fractals is(are) the way to go to get the more refined tools we need. All I really got from the Fractals part of it, is that one can use a fractal algorithm to create a simulated price time series of some security that is so good, that an expert, or a computer program for that matter, could NOT tell the difference between simulated and real price time series.   It would be really interesting to take one of these fractal algorithm machines and map all the possible outcomes  to all possible models(ie. their m1(mean), m2(variance), m3(skew), m4(kurtosis)) moments to see how tweaking the  parameters of the fractal engine could representthe common models that everyone is supposed to assume always work, as well as the more extremely skewed and fat-tailed distributions that all to frequently occur and lead  to ruin and havoc when they are inappropriately modeled as N(0,1), Student-T or something else.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|Fantastically well done horror movie. Horror genre meets the Oscars. It's anything but your typical slasher flick and infinitely better than all the torture horror that seems to be 95% of all they make these days. This film is clearly destined to go down as one of the greatest horror films of all times.  very well directed, acted, shot, moody and artistic  In the end, I would say it is every bit as good as the original Swedish Let The Right One In. Each does a few things slightly better than the other. You sort of need to view each one twice in a row to appreciate each one fully otherwise which ever one you watch second you end up thinking it worse since you spend too much time comparing them in your head and not getting into the second one in the proper way. Watch the second one again and then you'll see it's as good as the other.

0553328255|5.0|Let me guess, you want to get into Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes works - but you do not know where to start?<br /><br />You recognize \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" the most but realize it was written after a number of Holmes stories.... You do not want to start at the beginning because there are other more well-known Holmes stories you would like to get acquainted with first.... You have heard about the large number of Sherlock Holmes short stories and do not know which one to start with....<br /><br />Elementary, my dear reader - there is a simple solution to your dilemma: The Complete Sherlock Holmes: All 4 Novels and 56 Short Stories.<br /><br />You honestly cannot find a better deal than this: all 4 novels and 56 short stories featuring Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes in 2 chronological volumes for around $10.00. It is unbelievable - astounding, even!<br /><br />Arthur Conan Doyle is one of my favorite authors - and his Sherlock Holmes character (although Doyle himself would bore of the character and long for an end to writing about him) is one of my personal favorite characters of literature. Doyle's stories are suspenseful, funny, all-out entertaining and, of course, phenomenally written - the character of Sherlock Holmes is one of the most complex and fun to follow protagonists in the history of known literature.<br /><br />Unless you are a collector, there is no reason to try to assemble the works of Arthur Conan Doyle individually, piece by piece, when The Complete Sherlock Holmes offers you every story in two volumes for such a low price.

B005FT9XTK|2.0|I loved the book - it's quite gripping for a book in which not a great deal happens. It's no wonder that Orwell is considered one of the great writers of the 20th century.  However, this specific Kindle version of the book was terrible. There are spelling mistakes the whole way through it. Capital letters are used for words instead of italics. There are full stops missing. I don't know how this version was created, or who actually has the right to sell it, but I was very disappointed and surprised.   I recommend you buy the Penguin copy, which although is more expensive, will not have the spelling mistakes and other problems that this version sees.

B005IZLPMY|4.0|I rented the Blu-Ray edition of Captain America through RedBox.  The following week, I rented it again.  That was ridiculous, but that fairly expresses my opinion of the movie: don't waste $1.59 (twice), buy it for $20.  CAPTAIN AMERICA isn't a flawless movie: it's 4-stars, not 5-stars.  To add some rants and address some reviews:  1. The film is pro-American  Absolutely.  It's unabashedly so.  It's [expletive] Captain America!  Compare to actual WW II propaganda (c.f., Signal Corps museum at Fort Gordon) - shocking in the Age of Apology.  2. \\"Cheese to the rescue\\"  This is SHANE not PALE RIDER.  Captain America precedes the modern convention of the anti-hero, and the movie reflects that.  3. Some actors are under-utilized  The \\"cow\\" one-liner was rather painful (my drink went up and out my nose), and I foresee extensive usage of the \\"YOU ARE FAILING!!!\\" clip in graduate schools across the world.  Unfortunately, that's the extent of the highlights from Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Jim Cavezil saids it all.  To coin a famous phrase from one of his other movies, The Count of Monte Cristo, \\"it's complicated\\".  This movie provides an interesting diversion for Cavezil in the realm of Norse mythology and alien invasion.  It is an interesting adventure which combines action sequences and historical adaptation.  All in all, it is worth seeing. The film provides the right storyline elements. Plot exposition is well done and the characters are firmly rooted in tradition and character.

0517548232|5.0|Purportedly, the brilliant jazz saxophonist, John Coltrane, practiced scales four or five hours a day. Why? \\"Basics man, basics\\" was the great man's reply. If like Coltrane, you are a believer in the merits of the basics, this is the book for you. It's not new. It's got no hip new acronyms such as QE2, M2, or KEP, but it does demonstrate that one man's government benefit is another man's tax. The same with protective tariffs. Sure, a tariff that protects your domestic industry may help you, but what about the rest of us consumers who have to pay more for your product and now have less to spend on other things. Does this mean all government action is wasteful? Absolutely not. Government should act to improve the common good. Okay, I know this is where we can disagree on the details. Do we need a Department of Energy and so on? This sort of disagreement is healthy. What is not healthy is obfuscation. Don't tell me that a party funded with borrowed money does not end with a hangover. Don't tell me that your entitlements are not paid for with my taxes. Basics man, basics.

B0002EXH4A|4.0|This album rocks.  It is classic early Megadeth and I don't think it gets the attention of the others of the early period (Killing is My Business, Peace Sells, Rust in Peace) for whatever reason.  I've heard it's \\"technically\\" not as good as the other albums, yada, yada yada.  Whatever.  No, I don't rate it a 5 star, but it's still a fantastic album, imo.  Yeah, Anarchy in the UK is a bit lame, but it's still fun to listen to.  Besides, 'Into the Lungs of Hell', 'Set the World Afire', 'In my Darkest Hour'...that's good stuff!  I wouldn't necessarily call this \\"must have\\" for all metal fans, but I would call it \\"must have\\" for all Megadeth fans.

B005LJK3AC|5.0|First off, if you dislike previous work from Charlie Day, Jason Sudekis, or the last 10 years of Jason Bateman, chances are you are going to dislike this movie. If you love these guys, you will like the way they play off each other and give subtle cues, looks, and gestures towards one another throughout. Admittedly, they are not character actors, they are almost the exact same people in interviews and other roles as they are in this movie.  This movie delivered solid enjoyment with a significant amount of replay value. There are many funny scenes that will stick in your mind that every few months you might want to pop in the disc to watch. For me, these scenes include the individual workplaces, when they break in to houses, and many of the bar scenes.  In addition to the lead actors, the addition of great supporting characters from Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Aniston, and especially Colin Farrell, really add to the entertainment of this movie.   While the overall plot of the movie is weak, and the scenes at times feel disjointed in order to create funny, albeit unrealistic moments, the cast is extraordinary and bring a level of humor that makes this one of the best comedies of the year.

B0009VPFSW|5.0|We bought a few of these a couple of years ago and were able to save about 75% of the cost that we would have spent at retail stores.  We didn't know this brand at the time, but I can tell you that these have lasted several times each and have never failed us.  You'll want to be careful when buying this type of product to buy the type of flash drive (here is is a type 1) that your camera can use.  Many of the older digital cameras from the early to mid 2000's period cannot use the high density type 4,5, and 6 flash disks that you find on retail shelves.  So, if you're like me, you'll find some of the older type 1,2,and 3 media being phased out and hard to get at retail stores.  Transcend seems to produce a lot of the type of media people will need for their older and slightly older cameras.  Based on my experience, I would also try them for my newer camera.

Wonderful movie that brings me wonderful memories.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|This film is an obvious homage to the early films of Steven Spielberg, with JJ Abrams particular take: think E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind meets Cloverfield. Unfortunately, in working so hard in trying to recreate what was so engaging about those early films, Super 8 ends up being a film that is an accumulation of scenes reminiscent, if not outright borrowed, from those early Spielberg gems, minus the emotional connection that made those Spielberg films so memorable and thus enduring.  I have admiration for JJ Abrams, as it is clear from the type of projects he chooses that we probably grew up watching alot of the same tv shows and movies that nurtured a generation of children from the 1970's thru the 1980's, and who are now adults in their 40's. It is clear that Abrams admires Spielberg and clearly was impacted as a filmmaker by his work. But this film somehow fails to capture the sense of wonder that was so appealing in films like E.T. and Close Encounters. I know some reading this might think that someone my age (40 on the nose) has lost some of their sense of wonder by this point, but this is simply not the case. I still marvel at and feel a sense of wonder towards creative projects that truly strike an emotional cord. In this case, Super 8 just didn't do this for me.  The film has a rather lackluster story line with weak and predictable dialogue that is more cliche' than original; the alien has no personality or likeability (it looks like a rejected creature design from Cloverfield); the special effects dazzle without adding any substance or reality (a train wreck scene that should have annihilated the entire cast of young actors even before the story begins to unfold); and adult actors whose performances are as flat as...well, as flat as a one dimensional piece of cardboard.  The real highlight of the film are the performances of the young actors playing the adolescent characters, but their performances get lost in cliche' dialogue far too similar to Spielberg's early scripts, and scenes that are staged as if they were literally shot during a film class entitled: Spielberg Film Techniques 101.  In general, I like Spielberg and I like JJ Abrams. However, overall, I did not like Super 8. If you want to see films that actually hit the marks that this movie is trying to hit then watch E.T. or Close Encounters. They still hold up extremely well as far as I'm concerned.   Super 8? More like Mediocre 8.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Despite having read the negative reviews on this case, I decided to give it a try.<br />I have only been using the case for about 24 hours now, but it is exactly what I was looking for. The appearance is nothing fancy. It's a simple flat color (in my case, black) that has a little bit of a sporty look to it. No bells and whistles.<br />The case is very lightweight, which is great, being that the Kindle itself is so heavy. The back side of the case provides a sturdy frame for the body of the Kindle to rest in, while the front side is a flap that folds over to protect the screen. The flap itself looks similar to the Ipad 2 smart cover, without being magnetized. It has a heavy crease down the middle, which folds in and tucks into a ridge that is built into the back of the case. It appears that this wouldn't function very well as a sturdy stand, but with the weight of the Kindle, it works great. So far I have tried it on both a desk, and on my lap. I trust that with more use, it will fit better and feel a little more sturdy.<br />Also, you shouldn't expect this case to provide much protection in the trauma department. I don't trust that it would completely protect the Kindle if it were dropped. It will, however, protect it from scrapes and scuffs from normal use.<br />Overall, I am very satisfied with the case. If you are looking for a lightweight case with a slim profile that provides cosmetic protection for your Kindle, this is perfect.

Over 35 years later it is still not only listenable, but interesting, unpredictable and fresh sounding and still musically challenging. What other rock-opera/concept album can you say that of? (only Zappa's, [[ASIN:B008B37C8Q We're Only In It For The Money]] from almost a decade earlier).<br /><br />THE LAMB is an album/concept/achievement of mythic proportions. For how dysfunctional the recording process was supposed to have been, the result is an amazingly successful synthesis of 5 musical talents at their peak. And what they produced, while directly connected to their earlier sound (traced through the progressively improving TRESPASS, NURSERY CRYME, FOXTROT & SELLING ENGLAND BY THE POUND), was also different by a quantum leap. How could Genesis continue as a band after such an achievement? They didn't. Gabriel went on to explore his 'Electric Shaman' persona in an even more down to earth, less introverted way, and the rest of the band turned to churning out increasingly superficial (and successful) pretty pop hits.<br /><br />In '74 when this was first released my local FM station played the whole double album in it's entirety. I was an aspiring young Genesis fan then and when I stayed up late to record it, I wasn't sure how to digest the new sound or concepts. I didn't understand it all. It was clearly going to be an acquired taste, something I had to grow into. Years later after it was burned into my mind it became in some weird way my first religion - before I found something more substantial. And yet THE LAMB is still clearly a valid, grand, mythic morality play, incorporating sounds that both root us to Earth and Cosmos..., with words and concepts that unite Greek myth, English romantic literature, psychic archetypes and psychedelic music. It is in essence a story of, and guide to, adolescent male rite-of-passage initiation ritual. You could say The Who's [[ASIN:B000VG9PZ4 Tommy]] did this first, but being more complex, poetic and complete, THE LAMB has endured better.<br /><br />What resulted was the band's swansong, but each individual was distinct and unique and vital. Peter Gabriel was clearly inspired for this production, taking a lead creative role. His voice is strong, confident and flexible and his lyrics a string of inventive, sometimes profound and often witty one-liners. Phil Collins gives solid powerfully nimble drumming, as well as excellent backing vocals (a role he was always best suited for). Michael Rutherford's bass is a force of nature, crunching and churning along like the inexorable shift of tectonic plates (augmented by that deep and simple bass pedal). Tony Banks is all over the place tying it together with sustaining keyboards played with supreme, dexterous confidence. And then there is Steve Hackett, with a guitar sound and understated vibe that comes and goes like the plaintive song of a humpback whale in the deep, never flashy, always tasteful. And this is the rare accomplishment of this recording - a psychedelic classic that takes you on a trip (in whatever condition you begin in), to expand and challenge and reunite but in an accessible, never creepy or harsh way (like The Grateful Dead, or Pink Floyd could do). From the opening alienated Broadway street scene to the exalted final resolution of It, the album flows in one continuous blended series of sounds (made of a variety of catchy 4-5 minute songs tied together by the those incredible segues...)<br /><br />Like many of these reviews, this one is long on words and high onpraise. For many years I thought I'd put this album with it's adolescent associations and apparent pretensions behind me. But listening to it now as an 'old fart', I see how formative (and transformative) it was. I'm glad to have met and absorbed and been changed by it, and to have moved on, out of the depths and into the ongoing vastness of It. This sounds like a lot to expect from a rock band and album, but it's true.praise. For many years I thought I'd put this album with it's adolescent associations and apparent pretensions behind me.

0761944524|5.0|This book is incredibly helpful! Planning to credit Andy Field in the acknowledgements of my dissertation. His explanations and examples are carefully selected and go into just enough depth that you manage to really grasp each concept without getting bogged down in details or calculations. His writing style is so clear and cheerful it's not intimidating to dive into a completely new concept--just start the chapter from the beginning and let him walk you through it from start to finish. I especially like his little cheat-sheets for reporting results of different tests, where he tells you exactly what to include.

B001CC7PKS|5.0|Where to begin? Well, first of all, as many others have already stated: Yes, the director's cut of Daredevil really is a vast improvement over the theatrical cut! I personally didn't hate the theatrical cut, but I did find it to be kind of mediocre. But that's not what we're here for, is it? The following review is for the Director's Cut blu-ray of the film:<br /><br />VIDEO<br />I found the video quality to be absolutely stunning. I was especially surprised by this as it was only encoded at a bitrate of 20 Mbps. Whoever authored this disc did an excellent job. It's worth noting that while much of this film takes place at night, every scene in this movie still looks very crisp and clear. It's a 50 GB dual layer disc, and it's been used to its full advantage to deliver excellent video quality.<br /><br />AUDIO<br />The audio options for this disc are: English DTS HD 5.1 Master Lossless Audio and English, Spanish and French 5.1 Dolby Surround. It sounds great to me, even though I don't own a fantastic sound system to play it on. I have no doubt this will sound amazing on a high quality sound system, but I will update this review if I ever find out otherwise.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br />This disc contains plenty to keep you occupied, mostly behind-the-scenes documentaries and other supplements of that nature. I haven't gone through all of them myself, but here is the Special Features list, as it appears on the box:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Steven Johnson and Producer Avi Arad<br />- Enhanced Viewing Mode - Takes You Behind the Scenes as You Watch the Film<br />- \\"Beyond Hell's Kitchen: Making Daredevil\\" Documentary<br />- \\"Men Without Fear: Creating Daredevil\\" Documentary<br />- \\"Daredevil: HBO First Look\\" TV Special<br />- Jennifer Garner Screen Tests<br />- \\"Featured Villain: Kingpin\\" Featurette<br />- \\"Moving Through Space: A Day With Tom Sullivan\\" Featurette<br />- \\"Giving the Devil His Due\\" Featurette<br />- 3 Music Videos, 5 Photo Galleries and More!<br /><br />If I'm not mistaken, this release lacks some feature(s) that the Theatrical cut DVD has. That shouldn't deter you from this version though, because here you are still getting a pretty good amount of features with an arguably better version of the movie. I definitely see the special features as a huge plus for this blu-ray.<br /><br />MISCELLANEOUS<br />- Subtitle options include English, Spanish, Cantonese and Mandarin.<br />- Closed-captioning is available, if needed.<br />- This is a minor detail, but it bugs me: On the back of the box, the year of release is incorrectly listed as 2002. The movie was actually released in February of 2003. This is honestly the only con I can think of for the entire disc.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />This is a great release! Feel free to leave a comment whether you agree with me or disagree with me, or (especially) if there is something I have missed in this review.o Galleries and More!<br /><br />If I'm not mistaken, this release lacks some feature(s) that the Theatrical cut DVD has.

If you have a Blu-ray player and appropriate TV, you will love the sharp detail that this disc will bring to you. I'm glad that we waited for the Blu-ray edition.

0307595579|5.0|The Millennium Trilogy was the most compelling series of books I've read in years.  Salander should not be as sympathetic a protaganist as she is, but you end up rooting for her from nearly the beginning of the first book.  Her victory at the end of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is completely satisfying.
B00005UWMX|1.0|The video was evidently recorded in an European format that is not compatible with most US DVD/BLURAY players so I haven't been able to view th movie yet but I have researched the problem & think I may be able to reset my BLURAY player to accept all formats - just haven't gotten around to trying it yet.  Would have been good to have a warning on the selling site that the DVD wasn't compatible with US players.
B005IS565S|5.0|I had to pre-order this album many months in advance because of how much a fan I am of 5FDP music. Their first two albums left me in awe, I had trouble believing that a band could put together so many hard-packed hard-hitting songs without any lapses. So when I heard that 5Fdp was putting out a new album I had very, very high expectations. I was not disappointed.  American Capitalist is absolutely everything I could have wanted as a fan and more. I can't say there is very much 'new' sound here. The eleven songs composed of the formula 5FDP has been using since their debut album will remind you of what they've done before. I absolutely love everything they've done before though so you could say I have no complaints.  If I had to choose a favorite song off of this album I don't think I could do it. I love them all.  Of their 40+ released songs, there is only one I did not love, and it was a bonus track on the UK release of one of their first two albums. With American Capitalist, 5FDP is my all-time favorite band. Wherever they go from here, I will follow, because I know they will continue to deliver. If you have all three albums and you are looking for some more, you can check out Ivan Moody's previous bands, Motograter and Ghost Machine.  May the music be with you~
B002NEFL8W|5.0|This unit is needed if you need your batteries to max and you cannot take the time switching them out while missing important opportunities to film. The AA battery magazine is really useful in a real pitch for power but not recommended all the time as they go by fast and AAs are expensive. Sure, the camera is heavy now but I am not rating it down because of the weight as you are knowing what you are getting into. The side buttons are a HUGE plus and I love how you can disable them as I found out accidentally I was taking pictures when I didn't want to. Overall, if you are getting paid to film or take pictures, you need it.
B002KGKH5A|5.0|Quality movie about the white stripes and there tour through Canada.  It also include interviews that give you some insight into the band and concert footage
B000RZIGVS|3.0|As a huge fan for TNG, it's a great pleasure to have a complete series.   Also I got this for pretty nice price. DVD itself is satisfactory.   It has a very compact packaging, so you can save some spaces..  However, it's very uncomfortable to pull out DVDs from case...  Also, it looks cheap. If you a serious fan for TNG, consider buying other box set...
B0052GACNM|5.0|Love, love, love Tony!  I really like the diverse group of people he sings with on this album.  It was a nice surprise to hear such a variety of voices.  When you gather a group that includes icons such as Aretha Franklin and Willie Nelson, it has to be good.  Having Amy Winehouse as one duet was bittersweet.  It is a great album, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys classic hits sung by contemporary artists.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Received the time movie in a very timely manner and it played just fine. Granddaughter and I have throughly enjoyed it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This biography is among the best I've ever read. Many times I had to set my Kindle aside and wipe a few tears away. Other times I broke out in chuckles or laughter.<br /><br />Did you ever wonder about the Simpson's writer named Appel? Or about Homer's mother named Mona? These little nuggets are not central to the book or to Steve Jobs, but these details are intriguing nonetheless.<br /><br />I recall the first time I sat at a Mac. \\"What a joke,\\" said I. \\"The mouse is useless.\\"<br /><br />Then, during the next 90 minutes, I wrote a calibration procedure, 10 pages long. \\"Hmm, this screen and this design makes it easy for me to write.\\"<br /><br />I still was not won over to the Mac until months later when I started publishing a magazine that went on to national notoriety and acclaim, but I was certainly appreciative of this new creation.<br /><br />Isaacson's book is a bit like Steve Jobs. It is solid investigative journalism that should set the standard for biographies. At some points I found myself exasperated at Jobs for his idiosyncracies. At others, I was cheering Jobs' brilliance.<br /><br />Perhaos the Apple-Jobs phenomenon can be encapsulated in a cute one-liner or a cool sketch. Perhaps, but me thinks not.<br /><br />Nor can Bill Gates be accurately portrayed in such fashion.<br /><br />Each man did a great deal to advance humanity. Each led us towards the ideal we all seek. Neither extreme is complete without the other.<br /><br />Still, I would bet Apple will outlast Microsoft because of its one great philophy - build the greatest possible product and the money will come.<br /><br />I hope Isaacson does a similar biography of Bill Gates - C. William Anderson.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|i bought this in game-stop last year around the time when black ops came out. as soon as i plugged it in i heard a very annoying buzzing noise. that never went away. i had to put some pieces of paper on the insides of the cuffs to stop the buzzing. the earpiece also broke in two months of gentle use. i had to tape it together so i can still use it. in 10 mouths of use the speakers stopped working and then a week later i got frustrated and broke the other side of the ear piece off. do not recommend it for the price when it comes to hardware. the company also has terrible customer support.
B005WQ42JC|1.0|Only movie we could agree to watch at my Thanksgiving gathering.  Don't expect more than Cameron Diaz as a narcissistic, an overly made up gold digger in search of bigger boobs.  There seems to be several scenes missing that would help to explain the ending.

B004YJMQCS|5.0|Returned this purchase because it was not Final Destination V. Have this version, #IV in 3D with the green/red glasses.  Why spend the money if you can get 3D (with the green/red glasses) for 5 times less?  Final Destination V, after much investigating, will be available in Blu-Ray 3D only from BestBuy.  Why BestBuy is getting the exclusive makes no sense to me.  BestBuy has the exclusive on Harry Potter Deadly Hallows 1 & 2 in 3D Blu-Ray.
0143038419|4.0|First I watched the movie, and frankly, though I could have watched forever the Italy part of it, I could not get it; what all her anguish was all about? The movie simply did not deliver it. So I got the book hoping to find out more. It shed some light but definitely not the projector quality of light that needed to show what all this anguish was all about?  Ok, you did no love the man anymore and found out that you did not want the kids either, you jumped into an affair with an emotionally unavailable man, whom you were cutting into the love of your life mold, instead of seeing for whom he was, a transitional man. But is it really enough to justify the world expedition and eating yourself out silly?  But except of the above, the book is charming and unpretentious, and gives a glimpse of escape so many of us dream about. I am glad that it worked out for her and as I mentioned before, I would have watched the movie again and again just for the Italian experience alone...

006097625X|5.0|Reading a comic book is easy enough; children and adults of all ages manage to do so almost instinctively. To understand comics, though, is a more challenging endeavor; luckily comics theorist Scott McCloud has done a great deal of research and thinking on the subject and in this book lays out his theories and ideas about what he and Will Eisner term \\"sequential art.\\" In turns humorous, surprising, and informative, his easygoing and well-paced prose pairs with his varied but unassuming linework to form an accessible whole, a comic book about comic books which takes the reader from the common notion of comics well into the depths of sequential art. For the educator interested in using sequential art in the classroom, Understanding Comics would serve as invaluable guide to the form.

006082543X|5.0|Between the publication of the young adult novel by Neil Gaiman and its debut on the big screen, Coraline appeared in graphic novel form, adapted and illustrated by P. Craig Russell. Relating the tale of a self-styled girl explorer who is bored to tears by her busy parents and weird neighbors before discovering her too-good-to-be-true Other Mother just down a magical hallway, Russell renders his version Gaiman's yarn in a lush yet realistic style that is all the more disturbing when things take a turn for the horrific. Of particular interest graphically is the dynamic between the familiar world and the Other World and the look of the corresponding characters in each. While at first the differences are confined to the substitution of black buttons for eyes, as the story proceeds the two diverge in increasingly unsettling ways until even Coraline wonders how she could have ever mistaken the malevolent force she encounters for her real mom. As a narrative of an adventurer who navigates hazards primarily by wits and who comes to appreciate a home almost lost, Coraline could be used as an introduction to the themes of [[ASIN:B000JQU9VA The Odyssey]].
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Amazing vocals!! Every song is good quality enough to be released as a single. Best album she has out to date.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|OK. Understand this. I have been a Conan fan since the early '70s. Started on the L. Sprague De Camp reprints of his original Robert E. Howard stories and the \\"Savage Sword of Conan\\" stories from Marvel Comics. I like this movie. It is imperfect, but closer to the actual character of Conan than the previous Arnold movies. They were good movies, but they weren't about Conan. Love the detail to the Hyborian Age, very accurate. And this story wasn't what I hoped, but it is what I can settle for. Fun, violent, sexy, hard-core. Enjoy

B004SBQAL0|5.0|This movie was a very good action movie. It was annoying by design to draw the viewer in. The movie made you want to look for a sequel.
1416955070|5.0|first discovered The Mortal Instruments series right around the time when the second book came out.  I immediately fell in love with the books and characters and it quickly worked its way up two my second favorite book series of all time.  So for those of you haven't read the series yet I'm going to tell you about City of Bones, the first books in the series, by Cassandra Clare and show you what you've been missing out on.  Clary Fray is fed up with her mother's over bearing nature.  If she's so much as a few minutes late because well frankly that happens when you have to haul a cab in New York City, she's basically grounded and doesn't hear the end of it.  But when her mother tries to force her to give up her summer taking art classes at the infamous Tisch simply because \\"she needs to get out of the city\\" she's gone too far.  Little did Clary know that when she storms out of that apartment life as she knows it will be changed forever.  After storming out of her apartment with her best friend Simon in toll, she happens sees the invisible murdering hoodlum, Jace, she saw the night before.  But while she's confronting him she gets a frantic call from her mom saying not to come home and someone's found her.  When she gets to her apartment she finds that her mother is gone, and her only chance at finding her is Jace and his family.  City of Bones is an exciting YA thriller with evil, romance, friendship, battles, vampires, werewolves and much more.   I love that Cassandra Clare created this whole new mythological race that is absolutely refreshing in comparison to all the vampires and werewolf stories that are out now.  Something else that's great is that she isn't afraid to go to extremes with her plot twist to make the readers beg for more.  City of Bones is told just from Clary's point of view but as you get further into the series although she's still the main character you get a glimpse into the other characters minds as well.
B004HO6HWK|5.0|This was an excellent movie. It had the elements of sense of duty, betrayal, revenge, and deception. This is an easy movie to recommend to a friend.
031617615X|2.0|Bella Swan is marrying Edward Cullen, the [not so] man of her dreams.  She will soon become a vampire and leave the life and people that she loves behind her to spend an eternity with him.  The wedding, although a little outrageous for her taste and Jacob having wolf rages, was perfect.  The honeymoon was equally fabulous, she finally did the deed for the first time with someone that she loves and was going to be with forever.  She and Edward on a secluded Island with tons of things to do, but what Bella really wants to do is have sex with Edward, who refuses, again.  Other than that their honey moon is perfect as well.  That is until the impossible happens.  Bella misses her period and starts having strange cravings.  But that's impossible, Edward is a vampire, and vampires do not reproduce that way.  Edward and Bella's lives are about to be turned upside down and the forever that they thought that they would have together might be caught sort by a disaster.  [Spoiler Alert for those who haven't read the book.]  When Breaking Dawn, the fourth and final installment of the Twilight series came out I was so excited I went to Walmart to get it at midnight.  Although it started out really good, it was my least favorite of the series.  I'm not really sure how I would have went about doing to story myself if I was Stephenie but I feel like a happy ending for everyone was way too forced with Bella ending up with the best of both worlds.  Although I myself usually enjoy books with weird aspects, this one was a little too weird for me.  But then again that's what's so great about the supernatural genre: anything goes.    I did like how the book starts and ends with Bella's perspective but in the middle it's Jaocb's point of view.  I also liked how all of the character's finally come together and there are no more secrets which is the way I feel books are supposed to end.

B001U65X64|5.0|This review is specifically for vinyl lovers...  Is it worth finding and paying for Porcupine Tree on LP?  If you love vinyl, the answer is an emphatic YES!  The warmth of vinyl suits the incredible production of their records like a musical hand in glove.  I am loathe to identify a 'best' Porcupine Tree because their body of work is SO amazing, so I will not.  What I will admit to is that 'Deadwing' is my favorite PT LP.  And \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" is my favorite PT song, as good as the best song of ANY 70's Prog band - be it King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Yes, Genesis,...etc.    In fact, if Steven Wilson were transported back to the 70's, he would have a reputation equal to anyone in any of the aforementioned bands.  However, Prog type music in the late 90's and now into the second decade of the 21st Century is not an easy sell.  But those of us in the know appreciate what a musical genius the man is.  In fact, he is still making incredible music, check out his most recent solo release \\"Grace for Drowning\\" - also wonderful on vinyl and easier to find if you do it NOW!  PT is very difficult to find on LP and often expensive, so whether it is worth it is a big individual decision.  However, if the opportunity is there at a price you can afford, there is no question that you will be sonically delighted by this and any PT album I have heard. Steven Wilson's production IS THAT GOOD!
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Wow!  I thought that Lou Reed's last effort, The Raven, was horribly tedious.  This takes the pretention and horrible vocals to a whole new level of embarrassing!  An all time low for Lou Reed and Metallica.  It's not smart, it's not hip, it's not fun, and it's not innovative.  There's not much more to say about this album, but it is worth skipping through it at least once just to hear for yourself just how horrible it is.  Don't waste your money on it, though.  Find someone that was suckered into downloading this crap.

1451648537|5.0|Quite long but it had many valuable lessons. Steve Jobs is definitely not a saint.  If you can separate his \\"mess\\" as his wife said from his accomplishments then you will have learned something about perfection and focus and a lot of other stuff.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|When this came out I supported it. I even watched the 2 longer cuts. I thought that the director really loved Watchmen and this was his way of showing that love. I guess he does love it but the bottom line is that Zack Snyder is an idiot who makes crummy movies. I don't think his \\"appreciation\\" of Watchmen ever went beyond, \\"Omigod! It's a superhero comic with violence and sex and curse words!\\"<br /><br />Comics don't make good movies. They are their own special medium. Hollywood preys upon a certain segment of \\"fandom\\" who need to have their tastes validated by popular acceptance. They crank out adaptations of comics, video games, and old \\"cult\\" movies to make fast money, knowing that \\"fan loyalty\\" transcends good judgment. That's the only reason the long gestated Watchmen movie was ever greenlit. It's all nonsense. There is no need for a Watchmen movie, especially one as bad as this.<br /><br />Just read the comic, it's brilliant.<br /><br />I guess I've just had it with Hollywood pillaging (and ruining) comics. I've especially had it with this shallow, crummy director. He is not worthy of this material.
B005NFVZTM|1.0|Save your money and watch the clips on you tube. Absolutely a waste of money and time. Horrible plot, costumes and character development. Could have been a Saturday morning live action series easily. Almost like it was made for Riff Trax.
B005IZLPME|5.0|The effect used to make Chris Evans smaller deserves an Oscar. Performances and story rise above most other summer movies of this nature. This was my second favorite after Xmen First Class.
B004L0NGEC|3.0|Got this last night and it worked great.then today it stopped loading albums giving me an /Internet error. I uninstalled it and was told I could Np longer use the app on my device. They changed the compatibility and now I paid for an app that doesn't work. It worked GREAT last night so I am guessing this is an amazon thing because their Icon isn't hires? Get this fixed!
B005HSG3TC|2.0|looks ok but very uncomfortable when trying to read a book  would not recommend purchasing this cover, particularly for the price
1609611543|5.0|This is a very informative,interesting, common sense read. I decided to cut out most of wheat products for at lease a week. I can't believe the results! My sluggish feelings practically disappeared!..but best of all...my bloated stomach shrunk! I discovered that wheat bread was my biggest culprit. I still eat some wheat products. I just limit how much I eat now.
1442346949|4.0|This is a gripping read and certainly informative.  The book however, felt like there was so much more to tell about Steve Job's life, and too much was told about Apple's life. It felt a bit like an Apple infomercial. Maybe Steve Job's wife will take care of the rest in her autobiography.
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|First i have to say, i like this movie very much and i was so glad to hear it comes in the blu ray format.  saying shortly, its horrible, catastrophal,just terrible.  Picture its like an old vhs tape twenty years old and whats totaly wrong is  they wrote the sound is dts hd master 2.0.Forget it its a simple stereo no nothing Hd Master Audio.  the movie itself earns a 4 star but this blu ray just a half star.
B0068TJLSY|3.0|I didn't know much about Super 8 going in - other than it was directed by JJ Abrams. It was a fun film, and there were great performances by the child actors. Def. worth a watch.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This book is very good indeed. Alex is like a young James Bond and he has to stop a man from sending a worldwide disease and has lots of gadgets. i love the details and the plot. However, this book can be scary for kids younger than ten.
1400052181|5.0|This was a great story - even tho' I'm usually not into medical information for \\"casual\\" reading, this was so informative about many facets of the medical industry and how we have changed over the years.  It challenges the reader's medical opinions and how one feels about experiments and resarch for the good of new medicine.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|The ability to protect a note, which is not in this application (you have to pay a recurring fee in order to protect your notes), is a deal breaker. Too bad as I liked it. Went with AK Notepad instead which allows for protection of notes without having to pay for the privilege.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies and had to have it on Blu Ray. I like having both choices of formats.  I watched it with my three year old the other day and for the most part, it held her attention, although a few times, she wanted to do flashcards in the middle of the movie.  Even after that, she asked me the next day, if we could watch it again.  We have a projector, so it was like seeing it in the theater again.  I even enjoyed the unexpected bloopers at the end.
0756603749|4.0|This is not an encyclopedic reference.  It covers most of the commonly used knots with explanations that are, for the most part very clear and beautifully presented.  If you are going to buy just one book on knots you can't go wrong with this one.  Overall the explanations, the beautiful  photographs and the choice of colors all make it easy to follow and a pleasure to look at the instructions for tying the knots.  There are often a few well chosen comments on the advantages of the particular knot.  The book is attractive and a pleasure to read.  If you are just starting to learn knots, you may have difficulty following  knot tying diagrams.  It does take some practice but this book will help a lot.  Weaknesses:  There are some strange omissions.  As one reviewer commented, where is the Taughtline and the Trucker's hitch?  These are two of the most useful knots to know  and quite simple to tie.  Strangely the index gives a page number for the Adjustable hitch, which is an alternative to the Taughtline, but it's not found. I know everyone has his own personal selection of 'must know knots'  but these or some equivalents really are essential to one's basic toolkit.  Instead we get two pages devoted to the Turquoise Turtle, which is pretty  but not an important knot.  Furthermore,  the TT is a simple variation on the Surgeon's knot and could have been covered in a side note. Alternatively do we really need six versions of the  Bowline in a basic selection of knots?    Modern knot tying books with their lovely glossy photos  seem be forced into using two opposing pages per knot, regardless of the complexity.  Some knots need more space for a clear explanation and some don't need even one whole page.  (The Sheetbend is a very important knot  but it can be well explained with two diagrams).  The result is that the presentation of the complex knots is sometimes unclear.  If this is going to be the only knot book you buy, it's great choice, but I urge you to google the Trucker's hitch, the Taughtline hitch  and or the Adjustable hitch.  You will knot be sorry you learned to tie those.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I'm not a big enough Harry Potter fan to want all the extras.  I just want a collection of each film period.  So this box set works for me.  It only contains one disc for each film and no behind the scenes anything so very serious Harry Potter fans will be disappointed this.  This box set is for the rest of the public just looking for the movies alone.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This is one of the best comedy DVD's on the market, well worth the purchase price (probably more) and will be watching it many more times
B005SV9X22|3.0|Hardcore obsessive fans will like this, but the rest of you may be bored.  I had never seen a Lady Gaga show before and I had always thought of her as a talented artist and assumed that she was a fantastic performer with never-ending energy.  After watching this I discovered that she can't dance.  She's got a great voice.  She's a talented musician with some pretty far out costumes, however this show was on the dull side.  I guess I'm not as big of a Lady Gaga fan as I thought.  I know that the hard cord fans will be upset as they look up to her as if she were gospel and tend to be touchy if you discover you don't care for her.  They get very emotional and hormonal.  She's preachy in this show about being who you are which is fantastic, but I don't need to be coached up.  She shouts at the top of her lunges when she's speaking and its like nails on a chalkboard.  The music live was blander than the studio versions played on the radio and I watched this with a killer sound system.  I realized after watching this that she's successful because she's got a legion of followers that have low self esteem and need her to prop them up.  I get that, but I found her show to be mildly entertaining.  This isn't bad, but I expected something extraordinary from someone that is put on such a high pedestal.  Those same people will turn against her in the end as she ages.  The show is overrated.  Buy her album instead if you haven't already, but pick up the \\"The Fame\\" as the \\"Born This Way\\" album only has a few standout great tracks.  The rest is noise.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Reading the other reviews helped I must admit, but I had no problems at all loading and using the app on the fire.  Nice app.
1400069181|4.0|Let me set the record straight.  If your looking for all the legalities or ways to fund an upstart or not-for-profit then this isn't the book for you.  If your looking for a good read with all sorts of useful tips and comforting stories  to refer to in your quest for entrepreneurial success then this IS the book for you.   Mycoskie shows that no matter how big or how small a business is, it can turn a profit, retain talented employees  and make the world a better place by incorporating giving into its business model.  Had this book covered all the legal issues (incorporation, trademarks, patents, contracts etc.) involved with the business it would have received 5 stars.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|A great gift idea for any age group. Helps with being patient! Just like a game of solitaire, as you begin play, someone will surely show up and look over your shoulder, giving suggestions! A rather addictive game that provides lots of fun on a rainy day :)

I fit a 7D with a 70-200 2.8 ISL, 17-35 2.8L, 50 1.4, canon 580exII and Nikon SB-28 flash, a stroboframe flash bracket, cybersync wireless triggers , ETTL cord, AA/AAA charger camera battery charger, gels, and a bunch of cables, and a laptop. and I still have room for probably 3 more lenses. The nice thing also is if I want I can leave the 70-200 on the camera.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Coldplay have long established themselves as being cut above entertainment. This latest album is no disappointment. From the first note to the last Mylo Xyloto weaves a musical journey that only Coldplay could route. Another winner!
B004EPYZTE|2.0|I watched this movie for the first time last night and it had to be one of THE WORST movies I have ever seen.  I am a huge fan of the original Conan franchise and Arnold.  The blood and gore was just way to fake and unrealistic.
B005KMX866|5.0|For all Chris Isaak lovers, this cd set is tops. Chris's mellow tones on these wonderful oldies will take you back in time to Elvis and Johnny Cash and others of that era at their best. So put on the cd's, turn down the lights and be taken on a journey back in time.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Excellent blu-ray; I could   not believe how much better the picture and sound improved. I hope all conversion to blu-ray are as good.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|I purchased this warm, understated Christmas album last year, and it plays well enough on it's own as a stand alone holiday album, not even needing the crutch of Carey's now classic original Christmas album to soar; it wisely does not compete, but rather compliments.    Her vocal performances, while a touch understated in comparison to her 90's peak, were truly a welcome, and generous, step forward over recent offerings from her. And I do believe her song writing has only improved with time, as the new songs truly are very well structured and written, feeling like classic tunes from the first play on.   Standouts:  Christmas Time is in the Air: This is Mariah Carey, circa 1945. Lush orchestration, relaxed vocals, and a truly timeless melody. It is hard to grasp that this is not a cover of an older yuletide classic.  When Christmas Comes: If you're familiar with Carey's Emancipation album, truly one of the stronger gems in her extensive, if spotty, catalogue, this cut would be perfectly at home on that album. Featuring raw, powerful vocals, and a soulful 70's throwback feel, this is a must listen.  Charlie Brown Christmas: Few songs capture the Christmas spirit as well as \\"Christmas Time is Here\\", and Carey does a sublime, understated job on this oft covered tune. I dare you not to grin ear to ear at the song's opening, which captures sound of the Peanuts theme song as it would sound at a rousing Christmas party.   O Come All Ye Faithful/Hallelujah Chorus: The only negative I can say about this powerhouse cut is that it ends well too soon. Everything here is top notch, from the arrangement, the warm, rich vocals of Carey's opera singing mother, and a rousing finale from Mariah that easily rivals any vocal she laid down during her peak.   One Child: A moving ode to the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, this original tune is destined to find it's way into plenty of churches across the world. This is a spiritual experience, and the lyric is so well formatted, and familiar, that again it seems impossible that this isn't an old spiritual hymn that Carey simply covers well.  The tunes visit every pace and tempo, jumping easily from fast, to slow, to everything in between. Both the secular, and the sacred, live side by side. There is truly a conscious effort here to provide a little something for everyone.   Keep in mind that while the track listing stands at a seemingly robust 13 tracks, two are only slightly different variations of material from the original Christmas album, and one is a short intro.  The bottom line, this works, is truly a worthy addition to any Christmas playlist for this, and many more, seasons to come.  Merry Christmas to all!
1451648537|5.0|I'm hooked! Great balanced writing from Isaacson.  It's good that this book was started when Jobs was still alive.  I will read Isaacson's other books!
0780626494|5.0|This was a surprise gem I caught on a cable channel and had to buy.  The acting is very believable and the cast is perfectly blended.  It is funny, sentimental, pure delightful nostalgia that spans three decades of U.S. culture.
B005UG542S|1.0|I stream from other sites as well.. This stream was such poor quality. Movie is worth the watch. Streaming quality took so much away from movie.
B005TQAI6G|1.0|Throughout the show Britney keeps doing the hand-dance if you know what I mean, the choreography is the same with everysong (the X-cross hand, the butterfly-ear hand, the inviting hand, etc.) I can barely hear what she is singing, all I can hear is the beat and the bass. So basically, every song performance is same same and it makes me fall asleep. She is gorgeous and fit and I have so much respect for her but this is too painful to watch. And did I even mention some of the remixes are terrible.  I think Britney should have another choreographer and another Record Title, I mean whoever recorded and designed and released this DVD is so bad, the cover itself looks cheap and seems like they must have rushed to release it.

B004RFYEEC|4.0|There's no point in reviewing any further the importance of this long 44 years dream in the history of the Beach Boys and popular music for it could have been the first conceptual album ever, even predating  what the Beatles had in mind originally in the Sargeant Pepper. My only complain is that the whole packaging could have been better given the product we're dealing with.  The cardboard of the LP's is to thin as well as the inner sleeves, the paper fells like onion skin But the worst of all is the 45 singles that have vinyl remainings on the center hole and label and not the perfect product as it should be. No doubt this was assembled in Mexico as the sticker says, a true american  product will never come with these defects.  for the other part, this a must for any true Beach Boys fan.  Manuel Solera
B005HWUBUK|5.0|do yourself a favor and buy this album.   vinyl comes with a free download of the album as well, so you have no excuse!  ps - amazons new packaging for vinyl is brilliant! i've had vinyl sent to aus before, and it turns up warped - not a worry with the new packaging
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I returned this and I am SO happy I did after receiving my new Splash signature leather cover for my new Kindle Fire.  The Splash product is less expensive (its still on sale so grab one before they're gone.)  Don't waste your money on this when you can get a better quality product from Splash.
1451627289|4.0|This book just didn't do it for me, but it should have. Imagine Stephen King taking on the the Kennedy assassination with a time traveling protagonist who wishes to stop it. Also,imagine an 849 page book meticulously researched and vividly written to make the magical era of the late 1950's to early 1960's spookily come to life again for every baby boomer with an imagination. And if that's not enough, toss in the enchanting idea that when someone goes back to tinker with the past, they could create strings of disruption (the 'butterfly effect') that might cause history to unfold in a far worse fashion than what fate had in mind.  This could have been a powerhouse book. However, its last 100 or so pages just seemed to fall flat, and did not convey an ending to the story that was particularly original or powerful. Instead, it was a boring litany of events that happened as a consequence of the protagonist's effort to change history.   While I will not reveal the exact ending here, it was a typical Stephen King and had all the stark 'hell in a handbasket' imagery of The Stand, The Mist, etc. etc. etc.. And the true tragedy of Dealey Plaza (as far as this book is concerned) is that Stephen King's creative muse never survived it, and we end up with the tired themes and imagery used in several other Stephen King novels.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|Very unhappy with this cover which I ended up returning. It is not made of anything that would protect your Kindle Fire and has a terrible chemical odor which lingered on my Kindle when I removed it from this case. The price is outrageous when you can get a beautiful Splash signature leather cover with stand for less than this cover. Avoid this unless you're looking for a basically useless and expensive pouch that literally stinks.
B00005214X|5.0|This album is a masterpiece for George. In it he allows his admmirerers to grow spiritually and intellectually. His words are so heartfelt, and you can hear the sincerity in his voice as he sings them.  Going solo was the best thing that George could do....  he was such a diamond hidden inside the Beatles! I miss you George!!!!!
0060229357|5.0|I'm sure you remember Harold growing up and how cool it was that he could just draw whatever he wanted or needed to keep his story going.<br /><br />I love reading the Harold stories to my kids and seeing them from the adult perspective.<br /><br />Harold is an imaginative little boy, in one-piece foot pajamas that does a lot of great exploring at night. He often has the moon following him on his journeys and uses his purple crayon (a seemingly magical one that never gets smaller) to draw his surroundings and continue on his journey.<br /><br />He is often faced with a dilemma that he has to solve using his crayon and he does a great job, always escaping danger like dragons and aliens. I think all the Harold books are great but this one sets the standard.<br /><br />Kids are fascinated and adults have a good time reading and revisiting what was probably part of their own childhood.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|What an amazing voice on this woman, great vocals and a nice mix of tunes on this cd from pop to lite rock, a little R&B; something for everyone.  Buy it, you won't regret it
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I ordered this CD for my husband's birthday...as a way to let him know we were going to see Garth Brooks live in Vegas as his gift. I didn't realize that this CD set also included a DVD of videos too! That was an unexpected bonus. So, not only does this include Garths \\"Ultimate Hits\\", but the video portion is a lot of fun too! This is a perfect gift for anyone who loves Garth Brooks.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I see lots of complaints about this case.  I guess people didn't understand what they were getting.  For me, it fits the bill perfectly.  I don't like device cases that make the device significantly larger.  This one fits snugly on the back, and has the flip cover that can easily be folded backward and out of the way.  It props up nicely when needed, and barely adds any weight to the Kindle Fire.  I've removed one star for the price.  I would like to see it priced about $10 less a $20.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|Set the World on Fire builds on their previous album, with way more production, soaring guitar solos and a nod to the 80's power ballad, all without losing the hard-edged sincerity of their lyrics and a really addictive hook in all of their songs. Andy Sixx has a voice like velvet chocolate that draws you in and then draws blood! Like many bands with roots in the hard rock/screamo genre, BVB are evolving into into a true rock powerhouse, without sacrificing any of their fan appeal. Great guitar hooks from Ashley Purdy. Fantastic guitar and bass hooks and rock-solid drumming that is truly addictive. Rebel Love Song is a classic! A must for any fan of bands like Skid Row, GnR, Motley Crue, Soundgarden, The Damned and AFI.
B005TZFZJC|1.0|This record is something orwell imagined in his head as he was dreaming up the world of 1984. It's music designed to prey on weak minds.  Rihanna is one of the most cutting edge singers of her time, because not since Madonna have we been witness to someone with the balls she has. This woman will use any sort of angle to her advantage if it means her album will sell and she'll get attention.  This album is not only bad but also at times audiciously cheap and lewd. Take the song \\"cockiness\\" for example. I can not even repeat the lyrics due to the crude nature...my word! What young lady in her right mind would sing the lyrics to this song for all the world to hear? But I guess after she gyrated on a pentagram (rockstar 101) tried to make war look chic (hard) and tried to pervert young minds (SnM), what does one expect?  But beneath that dirty girl exterior that rihanna tries to project, there is a sense of vulnerability and hurt. Could it be the fact she knows she is being exploited, or is she simply playing up that role? Time will tell, but next time rihanna keep it a little classier, ok?
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Battlestar Galactica is one of the Best Sci Fi Series in the Sci Fi genre there is. It's great to have the whole thing on DVD That way I can watch any Episode I want any time I want. I have all the individual DVD series boxes (about 4 or 5 of these boxes) and decided I wanted the entire series box collection.<br />If you love Sci Fi and haven't seen BSG you gotta get this.
1926778103|4.0|I was a little hesitant about ordering this artbook due to some stories/reviews I've read about the binding being absolute garbage- but eventually caved because I loved the art style of the Darksiders game so much. Upon receiving the book I was blown away by how thick it was, and it's not just thick paper; there's a TON of pages, crammed full of various types of the games art, incredibly interesting to go through. The binding is a bit on the 'iffy' side, but at least with my copy as long as it's not treated roughly it seems like it will hold up just fine. The paper quality is excellent as is the printing, however I wish there were a little more text either talking about the art or the lore of the Darksiders world. If you enjoy artbooks or even just loved the style of the game I'd definitely have to recommend it.
B003UESJFG|5.0|This film is fantastic, hilarious, pure fun. The sound and picture quality are between the niciest you´ll ever see. A must-have imho!
B003TT2X72|3.0|The movie worked as expected; however, the case it came in was broken.  Not too big of a deal, but I have to buy a new case.  I will say that the shipping box was strong and well sealed.  Thus the Blu Ray case was broken prior to it shipping.    Shipping time was exceptional and packaging was great.  Only disappointing thing was the broken Blu Ray case.
B000CNE092|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid so I bought it for my young niece who now also enjoys it. It's a movie about the Russian princess Anatasia and her journey to discovering who she is after the Russian palace is attacked by the evil Rasputin. It's not meant to be historically accurate but it's so fun to watch and sing along.
B0001JXQDI|5.0|I own an Acura with an ELS surround sound system.  Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, there are few surround sound DVDs available, and even fewer that are reasonably priced.  This is one of the few.  And it is a very good Steely Dan selection, and the sound mixing is very good.  I wish there were more surround sound DVDs at this price.
B005OGYH90|4.0|This is a great live album! Slash's guitar playing is very smooth & flawless. There are 2 reasons why i'm giving this album 4 stars in stead of 5. I would say that i would give this 4 & a half stars total. Miles kenedy does a fantasic job for singing songs that are not his.There are about 2 GNR song's where he couldn't hit Axls note but let face it not many people can. Now i agree this should of came with a full dvd but for the people that gave this 3 stars and less that's there own fault because i even knew before i bought it that it only came with a 5 song dvd. All they had to do was look at the track listing or like i do when a cd is coming out go to the artists web page in case there is a bonus package if you buy it from them.If you like GNR & if you like Slashs solo stuff you are going to like this album. And for a final thought it's SLASH NUFF SAID.
B002BWP49C|4.0|I saw the first movie I through it was okay then when I saw Taylor Lautner took off his shirt I was hook on it for sure now I'm really a fan of twilight I'm never going to get bored of it ever!!!
B005M2OIB8|5.0|100% Pure Awesome!! This was one of the best comic book movies to date. It arrived when it was supposed to and was brand new.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|We never once find out what those weird white cubes are, even though this whole sci-fi film is based on that mystery. The finale goes rather unexplained, as well, when the typical space monster somehow manages to morph a bunch of earthly metal junk into a space ship in a matter of seconds. Say what? Prior to those letdowns, this modern-day Speilberg production features his usual band of cute kids getting into trouble, but avoiding anything really bad happening to them because of their wide-eyed innocence. If you enjoy that formula, you will like this otherwise high quality production. Just don't expect any logic.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|I had high hopes for this since I like Simon Pegg so much, but this was a complete waste of time. Biggest joke was about a female alien with three .... - and that joke was repeated throughout the movie. Horrible script. Rogen's character was crude and unentertaining. I can't even recommend anyone rent it. Definintely NOT in league with SpaceBalls - certainly cannot compare to Mel Brooks' dialogue. My opinion of Simon Pegg dropped a LOT after seeing this.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Believe the hype, the Twilight Saga is Amazing! The movie came in excellent condition, even though it was slightly used.  The product came in good timing.  The movie was epic, and worth more money than sold to me by amazon, although no complaints for the cheap price.
0307577589|5.0|Recommended as an audiobook for long drives totaling about 18 hours, to relieve the tedium of the trip, and keep you fully awake. A riveting tale, with an abundance of clever subterfuge, vivid description, entertaining circumstances, alarming incidents and suspense.  I wish the English translation from Swedish had been improved, with some appropriate editing, and that the narrator had enunciated some of the personal and place names slightly more clearly.  The chosen title is not fully appropriate because it pertains to only one of several major threads.  Reverting to the value of this book for roadtrips, aside from preventing drowsiness it furthermore encourages you to drink more coffee, by the power of suggestion, because the various characters sip many hundreds, maybe thousands of cups of coffee.  With such an overload of diuretics, strangely nobody in the story ever needs to pee, and the caffeine doesn't seem to interfere with anyone's sleep.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|Think of \\"50 Words For Snow\\" as a collection of short stories with a soundtrack.  The layers maybe slow to reveal themselves, but once they do, you're lost in a snowstorm of romance.  If you haven't listened to this album a hand-full of times with the lyrics in-hand, DO IT NOW!  A subtle and poetic stunner!

B0058YPGSY|5.0|I love this show.  I have all the seasons that are available and will continue to purchase any of the future ones.
B004LROUW2|5.0|to me this was a page turner.  I have read every one of Murakami's books, and this was right up there with the best if not my favorite.  Some reviewers complained about the book being too long.  It probably could have been shortened, but I viewed any extraneous info as just more of a good thing, since the writing was so excellent.  Kind of like David Foster Wallace.  It had the same feel in a way.  Don't believe the negative reviews.  Buy this and you will love it if you have enjoyed the author's previous work.
B002ZG97RY|5.0|This is the best movie ever created on the subject of modern warfare. I watched Hurt Locker after I saw this, and I was shocked at how bad it was (Hurt Locker, that is). It was unrealistic, melodramatic and critics were too eager to heap praise upon it by the bucketful because it was one of the first movies of its kind.<br /><br />Green Zone feels more like a documentary than a fictional movie; it feels more like a movie that wants to deliver truth than melodrama, and that's where it succeeds as a film. The action sequences are still great, and Matt Damon is certainly someone I highly respect as a physically-trained thespian, but the real magic comes in the script and the screenplay.<br /><br />Green Zone is deserving of the highest praise and should only be ignored by Republican clodpates.
B005POK858|4.0|This is a very fun Retro RPG game that is similair to the old Final Fantasy or Phantasy Star games. The game plays very well and anyone that enjoyed the old FF and PS star games will love it.   I only have 2 small gripes. First, the buying/selling/equiping system is a bit of a pain. You can't see what is best to equip without leaving the store menu and you can't sell items until you un-equip it. It's a bit tedious at times  Second gripe is that if you play it on a Droid X like I do, prepare to play without sound. When you first load the game the sound effects and music play fine, but within a few minutes both go silent. Not a huge thing, but still takes a bit away from the gaming experience.  I have no serious complaints otherwise. I got the game for free so I got more than my money's worth.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />\\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" was a pretty groundbreaking film that mixed stop motion animation with music and some good old fashioned creepiness. \\"Coraline\\" continues this trend though to me is fairly darker than \\"Nightmare\\". A young girl named Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) moves to a small town with her parents and she's not happy about it, she finds her life here boring and she doesn't care for her parents inability to pay attention to her.<br /><br />One night she finds a blocked door which leads to a familiar world, but her parents are nicer, everything is happier and brighter and Coraline of course likes this world and would like to stay but her other \\"mother\\" (Teri Hatcher) wants her to sew buttons onto her eyes. This alarms Coraline and the rest of the film involves her trying to figure out the mystery of this other world.<br /><br />The visuals are top notch, the voice acting fits very well, the story is pretty detailed and there's some good elements of creepiness that make this film not really for younger kids. I personally enjoyed this film as everything just came together and made for a well rounded film. ***1/2 out of 4 stars.
0812973992|4.0|The tie that binds the characters in Let the Great World Spin is a daring (and illegal) stunt in which a man walked on a tightrope strung between the Twin Towers in 1974.  The book has a wide-range of characters including two Irish brothers living in a rough Bronx neighborhood, a wealthy woman who lost her son in Vietnam, and a prostitute who is a grandmother to two despite only being in her 30s.  The chapters focus on different characters but they do connect up to each other so it feels more liked linked vignettes than short stories.  I'm landing back on my 3.5 star rating here, rounding up to 4.  I enjoyed the book.  I think it is natural in this type of novel to find some characters more compelling than others and I did sometimes regret not spending more time with some of them.  This isn't a happy read, although there are some inspiring moments.  I'd call it gritty realism with a hint of hope.  At times, I felt like it dragged but there were parts where I definitely looked forward to the next time I could pick it up.  Mixed feelings but still worth the read and I rounded up because I do think the author shows skill and took on an ambitious project that is not just the standard fare.

B001CGJ3QS|5.0|It was nearly 40 years ago when I listened some Beethoven Piano Sonatas by Wilhelm Kempff.  At that time, as for Beethoven, works of Backhaus and Horowitz were appreciated as \\"special two\\" in our country, and those of Kempff was recognized \\"not bad but not special,\\" by most of people.  I must confess that I myself had the same impression, and the motive of my purchasing the series of CDs this time was just nostalgies.  But, in spite of these memories and preconceptions, after enjoing all the CDs over I find myself very deeply touched and be so happy.  Not touched to cry, but simply happy.    Kempff's magical touch is heavenly soft and convincing.  Not light, nor the kind of making the great substance of Beethoven cheap, of course.  Thanks to the great effort of digital re-mastering, sounds of every touch become clear and bright, the softness becomes more impressive and characteristic.  Those makes us easier to accept and enjoy Kempff's greatness, and of course, Beethoven's greatness.  Now I am sure that these Kempff's woks are the best Beethoven Piano Sonatas I've ever experienced.  I strongly recommend the CDs to especially mid-age classic fans!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|There are books that are 5 stars good and then there are books that seem to be in a league all their own. Night Circus is the best book I have read in awhile. So glad I picked this up. Ms. Morgenstern's writing ability is one to watch. Yes, sometimes this book was slow but the writing is so beautiful that it didn't matter. The story was beautiful, the writing was beautiful, the circus was beautiful. Such an entertaining book. I would recommend this book to anyone. I was staying up late at night to read because I couldn't put it down. Grab this one, you won't regret it. I can't wait to see what book she comes out with next, I'll definitely read it.

B00005JOA0|5.0|Every ounce the creative literary genius that her sisters were, Anne Bronte is too often the unsung Bronte sister. `Agnes Grey' is certainly a solidly written work of Anne's, full of many interesting details to enjoy; but since I first found and read `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' a number of years ago (in my search for all writings Bronte), I couldn't understand why that story of the mystery tenant wasn't every ounce the classic hit that `Jane Eyre' and `Wuthering Heights' had become. I don't mean to diminish the stellar writing styles and heights of either Charlotte or Emily Bronte, it's just that I simply cannot understand why Anne's equally marvelous writing has been so very overlooked, over time.<br /><br />I realize that some of the `other' (what some might call lesser) Bronte works don't quite have the romantic punch of `Jane Eyre' and `Wuthering Heights', but `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' surely does. (And a little tweaking by a good movie maker could make most Bronte works, work as romance dramas anyway.) Anne's `Tenant' tale is along the same lines as `Eyre' and `Wuthering', though perhaps not quite as melodramatic as those two classic stars by Charlotte and Emily. One thing that I find so compelling about `Tenant' is the realistic look at a substance-addicted selfish cheating abuser, and Anne writes that scenario as if she lived it closely and personally. (yes, her brother lived something like that kind of self-indulgent life and surely she drew from his sad example, and she did work around other people whom she might have drawn bad or good examples from, but she was a spinster who died young) Beyond the `gritty for those times' part of the story, there is enough of the romantic in `Tenant' to make any romantically inclined woman swoon. The `Tenant' has the romantic goods: the lady, her hero, and their true love story. `Tenant' has quickly become one of my top favorite novels, alongside `Eyre' (which has been a cherished favorite of mine for more than forty years) and several Jane Austen novels that are favorites to many women.<br /><br />There is such amazing writing in most (if not all, as far as I can recall) the Bronte Novels: many sentences that I must stop to read at least twice because they are so perfectly done. Even though I'm much more wired to be focused on the character-driven details rather than anything that remotely approaches purple prose or flowery fiction; the Bronte sisters' descriptives that paint scenes with skillful choices of words, make me stop and repeat for at least the second read through. But then again, I reread many of the Bronte sisters sentences. I am often thoroughly amazed at their skill with the English language. And then there is French and German in some of their prose as well (perhaps only Charlotte and Emily's). Yes, beyond their innate creative genius, they were definitely well educated (primed for the higher class governess trade, or to teach in better schools). I can confidently say that all three of the Bronte sisters win my utmost admiration for their highest levels of literature, and Anne Bronte stands as a true equal to her sisters in her winning effort of `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'.<br /><br />This movie of `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' with Toby Stevens and Tara Fitzgerald is a great introduction to Anne Bronte's amazing story and I hope it will point many people to her original masterpiece. (Make sure you get an unabridged copy, because my first read-through of the book was mistakenly an abridged version and that one felt quite disjointed and unfinished in a slightly distracting way. Something was missing, and I knew it. I've learned to always look for the `unabridged' stamp because in the case of these kinds of classics, there is nothing like the original.),  If you've read `The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' novel or  listened to the audio-book once, twice or thrice, you will know how compressed this story is in the movie. Yes, of course the story had to be compressed to fit into the movie timeframe, though it is not a short movie for certain. One thing that stood out to me about the movie relative to the book is that certain aspects of the nasty husband are intensified: more harsh than the book, I would say. While the movie might not be exactly ideal for some younger ladies (such as young teens), the book is tamer and cleaner in that regard. Still, this movie helps tell the cautionary tale to teen girls and young women of some good reasons why not to marry such a `fixer-upper'. Toby Stevens does as excellent job as the hero and Tara Fitzgerald is equally superb as the heroine. I suppose Rupert Graves deserved kudos for his part, because he did make me hate him, and the abusive husband is definitely a hateful character, though perhaps not quite so thoroughly horrid and devilish in the book. After repeated viewings (and readings and listenings), I do find that I want to skip over the mid-section of the story, because I find it depressing and I want to jump towards the happy ending. All in all, I do highly recommend this movie, though I recommend the book and the Alex Jennings audio-book version all the more., though it is not a short movie for certain.

B000005ALP|5.0|My husband and I wore this album out 12 years ago when we were dating.  Now we can still listen to it, track to track, and enjoy every single song.  In an age when you can craft your mp3s around what you want to listen to it when you listen to it, that achievement on the part of any band becomes more stark.  Of course now the lyrics might seem a bit emo, but this album was written before that movement took off, when bands like Eels and Wheezer were pioneering the skill of articulating a volatile blue mood.  One of my top 10 albums and probably the only one on the list that was written in the past 20 years

B00005N7Z1|4.0|Possibly one of the best comic book adaptations of the 1980s wasn't even based on a comic property. Although he didn't get involved with the franchise until the second and third installments, comic legend Frank Miller's influence is smeared all over the first Robocop. Borrowing a heavy handed anti-establishment vibe, nacho cheesy looked-better-on-paper dialog, enough gratuitous violence to make a Troma flick turn away and stereotypical corporate bigwigs around every corner, I wouldn't be surprised to learn Miller had more than a passing investment in Paul Verhoeven's futurist nightmare. Of course, it could also be that Miller's influence on the comic medium as a whole was responsible for many of these parallels. Either way, it's a dream come true for fans of the dark, gritty graphic novels that made their mark in this era. It's also far from the most expertly crafted picture, with a carefree, cavalier attitude that seeps into the acting, cinematography, special effects and storyline. Arms are blown off just for the fun of it. Speeding automobiles barrel over evildoers in lieu of a more coherent way to write them out. Strongholds erupt into geysers of fire. As with Rambo before it, the lesson of the day is wanton brutality and the titular hero is your celebrated instructor. Despite its immeasurable shortcomings as a motion picture, that blunt approach to both villain and viewer alike makes it tough to turn off. A night with Robocop is like eating an entire bag of candies in one sitting; there's more nourishing, appetizing stuff out there and we know it's wrong... but sometimes it's impossible to fight that compulsion.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|Matt Smith's best season (of the two)    I've had in issue where the bottom third of the screen has been distorted in select scenes in several episodes and on different discs.  Has anyone else had the same issue?
B003Y5H542|3.0|A perfectly fine little family adventure that won't compete with any Pixar or Dreamworks masterpieces, but doesn't presume to in the first place. Johnny Depp brings what he does to every picture these days - an inimitable lust for life and boatloads of free-wheeling character - but the film doesn't make much effort to move beyond its status as a playground for his zealous voice work. Rango's plot is very by-the-books, and despite several amusing nods and winks to other pictures along the way, is never quite able to shake that burr loose from the heel of its boot. For a PG kids' picture, it also pushes the envelope in several spots with an armful of violence and a dozen jokes that will sail right over a younger audience's head. Didn't really bother me, personally, but it's not something I'll be pulling out for the rugrats until they're a bit older. It's good enough, with a genuinely excellent guest appearance at its climax, but never really approaches greatness.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I purchased this to use as a macro keypad for Cinema 4D. It has worked out. However, here are some remarks on my experience:<br /><br />a) Unless you know how to configure the joystick by way of writing your own script, don't plan on using it to pan around. You can, however, use it as four additional shortcuts. I use front and back to zoom in and out, and side to side for render and render window.<br /><br />b) Logitech has not created a version of their gaming software for the Mac. It does need this as it does have a shortcut creator from them, but just now the gaming software they also have for crappy windows.<br /><br />It is a good idea to use this instead of the keyboard as it saves much time. I just purchased a 3D mouse from 3DConnexion which should take everything over the edge . . . I hope. Good luck with yours.
1451648537|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews I have only a couple of things to add:<br />Issacson may not be a techy but he is a writer and has proven credentials on other works. It seems Jobs sensed that the completed work would be one that will stand the test of time. Right now, Jobs' generation may feel the book lacks in both expounding the techy details, and exposing the peronality quirks.<br />But in a decade or so, it will stand alone as the \\"approved\\" biography of a man who--almost inadvertently--changed the world.<br />I had read the Paul Allen autobiography just before this book and it was interesting to compare similar occurrences from both the Microsoft and Apple perspectives. Indeed, Jobs was more driven and achieved more from a consumer perspective but even his peers (Gates included) blame this on a chemical imbalance, rather than an inherent desire to improve society.<br />I felt like I was listening to Steve as the book progressed, and appreciated that approach. The man was often put on a pedestal but, in reality, a lot of what happened was due to his physical and mental maladies. And it is important for future readers to understand that, I think. He was a genious, but at a cost. In fact, as Issacson clearly indicates, that cost was an early demise. Issacson's dedication to depicting other people's viewpoints on Steve's actions and words is necessary in order for the reader to get the right message from the tale.

1451627289|5.0|My father always told me to be a leader, not a follower, and if I couldn't be a leader then I should simply keep my own council.<br /><br />I was thinking of this advice early this morning as I made my way through the last few hundred pages of Stephen King's 11/22/63. I was thinking of the advice in relation to a personal blog entry I'd made on November 24th, where I had written that I thought King could best Richard Matheson or Ward Moore, if only he could break free of the blandness and implausibility that I'd seen all the way up to page 500 or so of 11/22/63.<br /><br />To be honest, I came to this rather acerbic statement by way of re-reading S.T. Joshi's The Modern Weird Tale, in which Joshi rips King for being deficient in just about everything but a \\"remarkable sense of identification with adolescence, particularly with teenage boys.\\"<br /><br />I'll stop there because I have to admit to something. What I did on the 24th was grab Joshi's valid criticisms of Firestarter, Christine, Pet Sematary, Carrie, and several other early King works and bring them forward to 11/22/63. Decades forward, I should say. And I shouldn't have done that. Comparing King's earlier works (with the exception of the fine Bachman Books that Joshi cites in The Modern Weird Tale) to King's later works, most notably Full Dark, No Stars, Just After Sunset, and now the truly remarkable 11/22/63, is unfair with a capital \\"U.\\" Sure those early works held my attention when I was much younger and much less critical. Sure the plots of those stories were often  diffuse and implausible, just as Joshi noted. Sure they were easy, like the literary equivalents of a Big Mac and fries (as King once remarked about his own early works). But that was then and this is now.<br /><br />See, I like Joshi, I really do. I think he's a fine writer and critic. But here I needed to be extra careful with his criticism. I needed to not to multiply him beyond necessity, to not make Joshi's opinions of what was into what is.  Moreover, I needed to ignore all the reviews of 11/22/63 that I'd seen elsewhere. Really all I needed to do was just read the book and then judge it by my own terms--to keep my own council, as it were.<br /><br />So I read the book, all 849 pages of it. And you know what? I loved it! I said I made my way through the book. I should say I blasted through it, especially the last several hundred pages. And you know what?  I was in tears at least four times before the end. I bet I can count on one hand the number of times an author has been able to reach so deeply into me. As rare as hen's teeth that is, and just as memorable.<br /><br />11/22/63 is an incredibly touching love story that's on par with some of the best romantic tales ever. The novel may not belong in the same literary room as other time travel/romance novels such as Matheson's Bid Time Return; but seriously, what novels do? In any case, none of that matters greatly. King's novel can stand well enough on its own.<br /><br />Read 11/22/63. Along the way you may find yourself falling into the words, as I did. You may even discover the same thing Jake Epping and Sadie discover--that blood really does call to blood, that minds call to minds, and hearts to hearts.l the reviews of 11/22/63 that I'd seen elsewhere.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|Bladerunner fans are divided in 2 camps: those who love Deckard's voice-over and those who hate it.  This fantastic set should satisfy everyone. The first disc is the 2007 'Final Cut' that seems to be a beefed-up version of the 1992 'Director's Cut', made for this DVD set. Great picture.  Great sound.  Definitely watch this one with the headphones on.  The soundtrack is as layered as the visuals are.  This version also has 3 different commentaries, including the 2 writers, Ridley and Doug Trumbull (special effects genius behind 2001 and Silent Running).<br />  The 3rd disc is the archival one with 3 versions of Bladerunner: the U.S. Theatrical release, the International Theatrical release and the 1992 Director's cut (no commentaries).  For voice-over lovers, watch the International one.  It's 10 seconds longer than the U.S. one because of the extended violence... Roy Batty gouging out the eyes of his maker and pushing a nail through his hand.  Apparently, Americans can't handle watching this kind of thing, so these scenes are shortened in the U.S. version.  The director's cuts, of course, have no happy ending, the inclusion of the unicorn scene (which somehow proves that Deckard's a replicant) and no voice-over.<br />  The 4th disc is a grab-bag of everything else.  More info about Philip K. Dick. The best thing on this disc is the tribute to Bladerunner's amazing D.O.P., Jordan Cronenweth, the Rembrandt of film-making. Jordan paints with light from a base of darkness.  People and shapes emerge beautifully from the murky blackness. There's some original 1982 featurettes, a walk through the set with Syn Mead, mini-docs on costume design, deleted scenes and the final word on the 'is Deckard a Nexus 12 or what?' question.  Personally, I think, since it's almost always pure luck that saves Deckard's hide all the way through the movie, I'd say that if he's a Replicant he definitely came from the Reject pile over at Tyrell Corp.<br />  My favorite disc is number 2 which is one long documentary of the making of Bladerunner, from Dick's novel through to this DVD set.  Excellent.<br />  I chose this set over the 5-disc set which costs twice as much because, as far as I could tell the only difference is the inclusion of one more version... the 1982 work print.  I figure I have enough here without it and I definitely didn't need the origami unicorn, the model flying cop car or Deckard's briefcase that it all comes in.  I figure, that's what you're paying the extra money for... the toys.<br />  The packaging of the 4-disc set is beautiful, subtle and elegant, designed for a true collector.  These qualities match the way I think of Ridley Scott's directing style, especially this movie... subtle and elegant.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|THIS VERSION OF KING KONG IS DIGITALLY REMASTERED  FROM THE ORIGINAL 1933 VERSION. WE GOT IT BECAUSE IT WAS MY HUSBAND'S PARENT'S VERY FIRST DATE.

B0012YYZYK|5.0|This is the review of the Blu-Ray version of the movie that i saw for the first time in theater a long time ago. There is a improvement of the picture quality compare to the DVD version, but nothing as good as a Blu-Ray of today. What is so interesting about this movie is that it's not only a music concert, it's a lot more. There is some fiction images throughout the movie along with behind the scenes and real day life action footage with each members of the band. The musicians played a role by illustrating the story of the songs like characters in a movie.  The movie starts with the arrival of the crew and the band in Manhattan by car. The city where the show has taken place has a important meaning to the movie. There is some entertaining behind the scenes footage, that had took place during the show. It's a real treat to see the manager takes on his crew members who had let circulate some pirates posters of the band. There goes down the drain the merchandising profits! And not only that, but we learned that the show's profits have disappear in what looks like a robbery!  Now for the actual live footage! To have footage of the legendary band is a rare historical moment and i have never been disappointed by the quality of the footage, a little dark with no visuals, because the music was so appealing to me. The idea of illustrating the show with a story is not a bad idea, but at times, i was missing the joy of seeing the band play their instrument, it's the case, especially during the song \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", who is one of the best Led Zeppelin songs, along with \\"No Quarter\\", simply because for me that's the songs that are the closest to Progressive rock with their nice atmosphere. Another highlight of the show is the 15 minutes drum solo of John Bonham, who is captured nicely by cameras.  The extras contains more songs, and more footage of the conference press talking about the robbery that i was talking earlier in my review. After 38 years, it's easy for me to give this a 5 stars, because it's still a great music to hear today despite some flaws on the quality of the footage, but put in the context of the 70's and restore on Blu-Ray, it's nice to watch. The 5.1 mix also add a new dimension to the whole experience.
B002436WFI|3.0|Having greatly enjoyed Hogfather, we were very disappointed by this. Way too much David Jason and Tim Curry playing themselves. Sean Astin was just mechanical. Most of the subtle/sly humour of the books is lost. As others have noted, comic timing was killed by weak direction and editing. The highlight of the movie was Conan.
B005OK721G|4.0|When this movie was in theater's, I saw this movie about four times.   It is not the greatest movie of all times, but it is very entertaining, and I do like the revenge flics, and Zoe Saldana did a very good job portraying the character, she had a good balance between revenge and her emotions over what she was doing, she was not the typical heartless killer. On par her character reminded me of Denzel Washington character from \\"Man on Fire\\", both characters balanced their revenge and their emotions with their revenge acts.  The movie could have been better, maybe more character development with the bad guys and her parents to fully understand the revenge, other than that she saw them killed in front of her.   I am hoping the unrated version will open up more story line to the film, if not, I will still enjoy the film.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to satisfy their revenge flic need, like Man on Fire, Man a Part, etc.
B0068TJLSY|2.0|I thought this was gonna be about the alien more then anything else. The alien actually took a back seat for most of the movie, while the rest of the movie goes into character development mode a little to indepth of that as far as I'm concerned. When a little alien action finally comes to play it seems a case of a to little to late to save the movie.<br />It also didn't help that the story revolves mostly aroung young teens. I wanted a frigging alien movie not Monster Squad (which I would say is better then this).<br />Renter at best, had I known what it was going to be like I'd never even bother renting it. (oh that's right I went ahead and saw it at the movies).
0230755062|5.0|I loved the Language of Flowers as did my book group. Wonderful story and I will never look at flowers the same way again .Truly well written and descriptions were fabulous.
B004EPYZT4|1.0|I can't understand as I read the reviews how ANYBODY could like this movie. I'm thirty four years old and have seen the originals although I only remember some of the key parts but I do remember liking them. I just read a review where the guy writes that Momoa was a better Conan then Arnold.  REALLY????? Look at Arnold in his hay day and tell me he doesn't look the badass warrior he is made out to portray, the guy's comments were ridiculous but opinions are opinions. I went to see this movie with my two sisters one is sixteen the other twenty and they loved the movie and that's all you need to know.  The same target audience as Twilight loved this movie. Enough said.
1451648537|5.0|A book I couldn't  put down. I worked in the silicon valley in the 80's and followed Apple news  (couldn't help it). To read tge background and inner workings of Jobs/Apple was fascinating. A rare insight to an industry leader. Although brief there were also unvarnished insights to Bill Gates. I hope Bill Gates allows the Walter Isaacson to write his story as well.
B005V20JKI|5.0|this game is very original and off the beaten track. it is made extremely well, and is very addicting. my favorite game on my kindle fire so far! great job guys!

B004W2UBYW|2.0|The book carefully describes the Jobs quest for perfection... a perfection this work itself does not achieve. Perhaps the author and publisher were in too much of a rush to catch the wave of interest following the death of the subject?
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Great monvie brought back memories when I had bought  comics   Did a good job sticking to original plot line in Marvel comics   Special effects awsome no matter what your age you will enjoythis movie
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are good buy at ten bucks. I've owned around ten pairs of these. They can endure quite a bit of punishment before they give up. They're a bit mid-range-y compared to entry-level earbuds, but they're plenty loud if you're crankin' it.   When you get these out of the box, get your duct tape and tape the cord to the speaker housing on each side. I've ended these with one serious yank (I think I dropped a barbell on the cord while wearing them), and duct tape saves them from that particular catastrophic fail.   They're finally making these with the longer cords now, a bit of a mixed blessing, but they're also putting in a little thingy you can wrap the excess cord around so it doesn't get caught on stuff like falling freeweights. I usually just use duct tape for that.   I should give these five stars because I've had a couple pairs of these last over a year--practically a miracle, in my book--but I like a little more bass in my sound. A tip if you get these and like bass, too: get a tight headband that presses them into your ears and tilt them back on your head a bit--then they kick butt in the bass department.
B004X75RCW|5.0|Great romantic comedy.  The characters and story line move along with some good comedic situations.  Also has a great appearance by Betty White who really adds to the movie.  Good movie for evening with the wife or girl friend.

B005P89F1C|5.0|Justin Bieber steped up his game with this one, it is probably one of his best CD's. I've listened to it non stop since I got it. It really gets you in the mood for Christmas and I really enjoyed it. The DVD that came with it was really inspiring. It shows you how he works and how much he really puts into his music. It was a great addition to the album! I recommend everyone get this album!!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The movie came in a very fast timeframe and was exactly what I thought it would be.  The thing which makes it five stars is that the price was amazing, the delivery was fast, and who doesn't like the Dark Knight? :)
1439102732|2.0|I am not a bigot nor racist nor do I judge people by their sexual orientation -- but I did not like this book at all!!!  It took forever to get through it and I am a fast reader.  I'm really sorry I bought it and the CD was less than average.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a beautiful story for which you will likely need a box of tissues. I never thought it would fit into my list of all-time favorites. This should be mandatory for elementary and junior high school viewing. It would put many handicaps into better perspective.  Highly recommended! I'm gifting copies to close family and friends.
B005JS7W4K|5.0|Today I just ran across this listing in Amazon and ordered it within seconds.  So I cannot comment on the packaging or sound quality, but being issued by Warner Brothers UK, I am confident that both will be excellent.  What I can comment on is:  finally, to my ears, the single best Tim Buckley album \\"Blue Afternoon\\" is back in print after years of being unavailable.  \\"Blue Afternoon,\\" although comprised of so-called \\"leftovers\\" as far as Buckley was concerned, has always been my favorite Buckley album, which I purchased when it came out in 1969. Parts of it have been anthologized, but Buckley was always an \\"album-artist\\" and is always best appreciated hearing him in that context.  \\"Blue Afternoon\\" is full of highly melodic, moody and totally accessable tunes (perhaps partly explaining why Buckley himself dismissed it.)  In fact, his next album \\"Lorca,\\" also contained in this collection, is where Mr. Buckley lost a whole bunch of fans who had followed him through his thrilling musical growth, albums one through four.  \\"Lorca\\" is highly experimental and contains only some sonic similarities to his prior work, but melodic and accessable...forget about it.  But that was the artistic growth pattern that Buckley followed.<br /><br />  Quickly, his first album is spare, folky, somewhat naive but highly interesting in what it suggests for the future.  \\"Goodbye and Hello\\" has much more developed, inventive songs, showing a wonderful range of talent.  \\"Happy Sad\\" is probably his most popular album with the haunting \\"Dream Letter,\\" the gorgeous \\"Sing a Song for You\\" and the completely successful experimental suite \\"Love from Pacific Coast Highway.\\"  Then comes \\"Blue Afternoon.\\"  Just listen to the passion of \\"I Must Have Been Blind,\\" the smokey seduction of \\"Cafe\\".....if these are \\"leftovers,\\" I'll take another helping.  Having Buckley's first five albums in a complete package for a quite reasonable price is an absolute joy. This is how he should be heard.<br /><br />  Later:I received my cd from the UK, so I can add a couple updates.  Five separate discs are housed in cardboard exact reproductions of the original lp covers....except, \\"Goodbye and Hello\\" and \\"Blue Afternoon\\" were fold-out covers, and that is not reflected here.  One negative is the total lack of documentation as to anything but the song titles and producer's credits.  A single paper insert would have been most welcome.  The sound quality is excellent, and again, there are no credits for remastering, but this is a Rhino/Warner product, and they issued the outstanding \\"Tim Buckley Anthology\\" in 2001, with full remastering for all the songs contained there.  So, I will keep my copy of \\"Anthology\\" for its excellent annotation and post-\\"Lorca\\" tracks, and keep \\"The Original Album Series\\" so as to have all of Buckley's early work.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I discovered Dexter a few years after the series' original debut, but instantly fell in love!  Once I watched the very first episode of Dexter:  The First Season, I simply could NOT stop watching!  I may have even watched the entire first season in one day.  Watching Dexter struggle with his \\"Dark Passenger\\" and his serial killer tendencies is absolutely enthralling.  You never stop rooting for Dexter, even when he's cutting people into little pieces... after all, he's a hero, AND a serial killer!  An unlikely combination.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. This is quite useful. It is convenient and portable. You can use it anywhere as long as your mobile device supports it.
B005QBKXOQ|1.0|I swear, I can't tell one Daughtry song with another anymore.  Seems he's gotten lulled into a formula that tells the mantra of \\"loud music, loud singing, blah blah blah, rinse, repeat\\".  This guy doesn't have one ounce of originality of creativity in his body.  To me, it's all smoke and mirrors and promotion. Turns out he's not any better than the neighborhood bar singer. Pass on this album.
B000001ES9|5.0|Why couldnt they remain this way? I guess they had to compete with the Journey and Foriegner souding bands during the 80s.  I was and still partial to the harder bands.this is great.

B00001W9G0|5.0|Watched this movie so many times, I think I know most of the dialogue. Captures the eras perfectly. So romantic, fun, sad, all the emotions. Timeless movie. Redford never looked better - same for Streisand!
0062011847|5.0|This is an excellent study of prejudice without basis and the influence it can have. It is done with examples that are both touching and humorous.
0767827791|5.0|Made in the 50's. Acting a tad hokey by some. William Holden never looked better. Same for Kim Novak. Love the picnic scene when they danced on the dock. Worth the watch. Music beyond great.
B000V39KDO|5.0|This is an incredibly focused movie:  300 soldiers fighting for freedom(pretty strait forward).  But while it is simple, it is not shallow at all.  The backbone of the movie is the motivation and emotion of the spartan king. So, while it has tons of slick CG action, the characters carry the movie to a fantastic finale.  One of the best action movies ever!!!
B000BSO732|5.0|If you like Audrey Hepburn you will love this movie. Her clothes are fantastic. George Peppard is most easy on the eyes - so handsome. Great music for sure.
0393338827|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Michael Lewis following three firms as they made huge bets against Mortgage Backed Securities.  The cast of characters are colorful including a one eyed neurosurgeon who quit his medical training to become an investor.  While you can read the book without extensive knowledge of financial terminology it does help to know what a MBS, CDS, etc. are.  While the subject is important and intriguing it is sometimes disjointed and jumps between the three firms and keeping track of the cast of characters becomes a challenge.    In the end there is a moral ambiguity in what these three firms are doing.  They know that what they are doing is going to have an adverse and huge impact on America and the world at large.  While their actions are questionable the actions of Wall St. at large is unquestionably deplorable.  As long as there was money rolling in they ignored all the dangers.  Unfortunately nothing has been learned and derivatives (which was pointed out as a danger by Lowenstein in When Genius Failed) is still unregulated.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|This CD is absolutely amazing! This is honestly the hottest CD out right now the CD has a techno/dance RnB feel to it which is new for her. The CD is very well done.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Almost a mix between Keane, Coldplay, and the Postal Service, this album is one of those that you can press play and listen all the way through without skipping tracks.  There is very little filler, and I wouldn't be surprised if there were 4 to 5 singles off this album.
B00005JPLW|4.0|In creating the ultimate movie for sword-and-sandal blood-spatter fetishists, director Zack Snyder scores on the spectacle side - 300 looks amazing - but his mechanical story line and over-the-top melodramatics don't support the action.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I cannot believe you  think this could ever be worth more than 10.00.<br /> This is so  over priced.<br />[[ASIN:B005HSG3U6 Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Pink]]
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Very action packed movie based upon a real incident.  I am not a railroad engineer but I question when the throttle accidentally slips out of the neutral position, to initiate the runaway train, why it would go to notch 8 (full throttle).  Also, wouldn't it be possible to activate the train's brakes by rupturing the air hose line? Since it was based on a true incident there must have been reasons which were not explained, or I didn't pick up on the way the train operates. Still a great roller coaster ride of a movie.
B001R10BMS|5.0|No matter what critics, fans or naysayers state to me Sean Connery is the ultimate Bond. Suave, charismatic and completely sexy (even in his fifties when this movie was made) Connery has had many actors (most notably Daniel Craig) give him a run for his money acting as the super spy agent, but Sean Connery, who originated the role, will always be this character. So, in 1983 it was with great relief Connery was persuaded to reprise the role in \\"Never Say Never Again\\", the second Bond film released that year. However, this particular movie was not produced by the original Bond producers, but by an independent franchise and different studio. That is why you won't find this movie in other box sets that house other Bond films.<br /><br /> The title of this film is derived from a quote Connery gave way back in 1971 after he did \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\" when he said he would never play James Bond again. At 52 he looks even better than he did in previous Bond outings (if anything he is more handsome). In this version Bond investigates the theft of two nuclear weapons by SPECTRE.<br /><br /> Among the beautiful women in \\"Never Say Nevr Again\\" is Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera.<br /><br /> On a budget of $36,000,000 the film grossed an amazing $160,000,000 at the box office.

1594484805|4.0|Daniel Pink has written an important book about motivating workers in large and small organizations.  He starts with the science, talks to everyone who has studied motivation and rewards for the last 40 years. He puts down on paper what a lot of us thought and never really put into practice.  There is an intrinsic drive in nearly everyone that will make people do things for which they do not get paid, promoted, or recognized. The best example is the crushing defeat of the well-financed and managed Microsoft Encarta by a rag-tag start-up Wikipedia led by the eccentric holier-than-thou Jimmy Wales.  Pink's basic thesis is that motivation has evolved from a need to eat, to a need to avoid punishment, to wanting a bonus, to feeling the love from our compatriots. I think he is at his most insightful when he talks about when and how bonuses and rewards work and the undesirable side-effects we see from relying on them in the wrong situations (think Enron and MCI).  What is unique here is going back to scientific studies to support this approach, rather than arguing from some philosophical or vaguely experiential basis.   A lot of companies are using this book to evaluate motivation.  I was exposed to it in that way and had a good experience with the FedEx day concept at a recent Annual Sales meeting. This concept says that you can spend at least one day and sometimes up to 10-20% of your time working on new ideas, that were germinated from a lower level cross functional team, rather than handed down from on-high. If you get the right team and idea, it works well.    Unfortunately Pink is a terrible writer and most of the book is a complicated recitement and repeat of his excellent distillation of motivation theory.  The book is too short to be called a book.  He only gets to 250 pages by including extensive glossaries, footnotes, thank you's, summaries, shorter summaries, worksheets, and cocktail party sentence descriptions. Pink would have done better to write a six pagearticle for Forbes or WSJ but I doubt you can get $16 a pop for that.
1442346949|4.0|This biography does a lot to show the quirky, human, flawed part of Steve Jobs' personality, although it always comes from an admiring or forgiving point of view.  The CD Audio version kept me interested on my commute to work for a week or so. The one criticism I have of it, though, is the author tried to balance a discussion of Jobs' personal life and his impact on Apple with a larger view of how Apple's closed system compared with PCs more open system.  He picked a chapter much too close to the end of the book to get serious about this discussion. At that point in the book, I was way more interested in Steve's final few years than I was about the age old argument of whether PC got it right or Apple got it right.
0452289963|5.0|Tolle pens another book of groundbreaking calibre.  The reader need only read and parts of the self will begin to drop away.  An excellent intro as well as confirming for the serious path-less seeker.
B005HSG3U6|1.0|This case is made of incredibly cheap materials and would not stand up as pictured. The hinge would not go into the slot, and I never did figure out what the band was for.  My husband, who is incredibly handy, couldn't make the thing stand up either and said, \\"This is garbage.\\"  I am so grateful to Amazon for its return policy!  I can't fathom why others like this product or how they made it work.
B000001ELD|5.0|Even though a lot of the songs on the record weren't what you would call KISS worthy songs, Gene did a good job putting this together. I was impressed by the quality work and the effort he put into this album.
B005HPA2XI|3.0|It's not as strong as previous efforts. They're still great players and the songs are good for the most part. It is a departure from previous efforts as it sounds much \\"lighter\\". Most of this has been covered in the other reviews.  The dvd is quite disappointing. Blood Mountain had the best dvd which followed the making of that album. This is pretty lame with no behind the scenes stuff or real insight into making the cd. The dvd with Crack the Skye wasn't that interesting either but this one I would say this one is much worse.
B004GYY714|1.0|this comes up as an alternative to unearth radio, but the stations I want are all restricted. I don't get it.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|After reading another reviewer I decided to check the Amazon.co.uk site.  Better 8 disc box set plus 3 extra bonus material DVDs.  Total US Dollar price at checkout $48.16.  Pre-order to ship Dec 1st.  Can't wait.  Might have to pay a conversion fee on the credit card, but still works out cheaper than this price.  So it'll be about $6.25 for each BluRay disc!  Way cheap!!!!  Check it out for yourself before buying.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is divided into 3 different parts each with 9 chapters. The first few chapters are very good, but once the books hits Part 2... WOW. There was not a part where I got bored. There was a twist at every corner which made the book even more enjoyable. I am a loyal Harry Potter fan, but this series might be even better.  I can easily place this book as #1 in my favorite books list.
B0052VI2WA|4.0|This SACD import version of the 5.1 surround mix of \\"Fragile\\" is, for the most part, very satisfying. The sound quality is great, of course, and the surround mix is, at times, inspired. An example: The bridge of \\"South Side of the Sky\\" featuring the piano solo by Rick Wakeman. It opens in the rear speakers, and as it builds, there's a brief drum statement by Bill Bruford that you hear from the front speakers. It's a great moment; throughout its numerous lineup changes, Yes was always blessed with great musicians, and here are two of them, set off perfectly by the multichannel mix. As the song moves back to full band involvement, Wakeman's part shifts quite nicely and subtly to the front of the mix, making room for the surround effect to be applied to the \\"la la la la la la\\" vocal part.<br /><br />At other times, the mix can be a bit ham-fisted, especially when it comes to Steve Howe's guitar. There's too much emphasis on fiddling with his various parts. And I also think Bruford and bassist Chris Squire should have been mixed a bit higher -- this great rhythm section ends up sounding a bit sonically flat here and there, especially on what should have been Squire's showcase, \\"Long Distance Runaround/The Fish.\\"<br /><br />This is one of the few cases, in fact, where I actually prefer the DVD-Audio version to the SACD. Normally, I find the latter format to be warmer, more \\"ear friendly,\\" whereas DVD-A can be kind of aggressive on the high end. In the case of this release, the DVD-A provides that treble gloss, which highlights Jon Anderson's voice and Howe's electric parts.<br /><br />Either way, though, if you're a Yes fan, this is one of the cornerstone albums to own, and the experience is even more immersive in the 5.1 format. Enjoy!
0920668372|1.0|I understand what the author is attempting to say, but this book is not silly or cute about the way the mother can't let go of the infantilization of her son. Max Lucado's \\"In Case You Ever Wonder\\" does a far better job of talking about the cherished relationship between parent and child.

1423140591|5.0|This book is the second book in the series \\"the heros of olympus\\" and it was just as good as the first. A Great read, for all ages. To fully get the story and backround You should read \\"Percey Jackson and the Olympians\\" series all 5 books first then \\"the lost hero\\" which is the first of the \\"heros of olympus\\". There is another book comming out in the fall 2012 That I and my chidren can't wait to get our hands on. I couldn't be happier this this book. It answered so many questions and gave me some new ones! Can't wait to have them answered next! ENJOY.... I know we will!!!

0446691437|5.0|... from the blurb.<br /><br />It's more or less a good inspirational book.<br /><br />If you see the thesis of the book, reading it is postponing the writing, so it adds to resistance and so reading the book is self-defeating in a way (if that didn't make sense, read the book)...<br /><br />It has some useful tips and useful strategies -- including how to think of yourself when you approach writing. it was worth the money I spent on it.<br /><br />Worth it for graduate students getting ready to write theses, and would be writers who plan on one day coming sometime soon.<br /><br />And I would definitely own a copy rather than just check it out of the library.

B0043URV5U|4.0|To state that an album is the Ultimate Collection it should be just that. It should contain all the radio hits coupled with concert staples. Once again they are close. The hits are there,<br />the majority being the same as the album tracks in length. In order to say that it is the Ultimate Collection, one must include certain songs that have become associated with the artist.<br />Where is New Coat of Paint, Tomorrow, Sunspot, Manhatan, Chances Ar, In Your Time, C'Est La Vie, Understanding, and the classic Satisfied? For the newcomer to Bob Seger, this collection<br />will keep them happy. For the serious fan, I was hooked on Seger when I first heard  Ramblin' Gamblin' Man, it is not enough.  One CD clocks in<br />at 49 minutes while the other comes in at just over 59 minutes. The label had time for these left out songs. Shame on you. Th sound quality has been clened up and<br />finally you get a decent version of Old Time Rock and Roll. Bob Seger has a wealth of music that hopefully some day will be releaed in a box set. For now this is the best collection out there.<br />The sound quality throughout the CDs is excellent. The songs are great. Buy it.
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|I first heard about DieAntwoord from youtube.  I'm not a fan of rap music at all..but a huge fan of electronic and industrial music.

0141040343|5.0|When the book came in, it was in perfect condition. It was a gift for my girlfriend because she loves Pride and Prejudice as well as books with classic and artful bindings. It was a perfect gift and I plan on buying the collection.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Buble has never let us down yet and this CD proves it.  He has such a fantastic voice and he has chosen some really beautiful Christmas songs.  He sounds a lot like Bing Cosby with a modern swing.  Cheers you up and leaves you feeling good.

0060594896|5.0|I read many books but few of them are worth of reading them again. THE SUCCESS PRINCIPLES: HOW TO GET FROM WHERE YOU ARE TO WHERE YOU WANT TO BE falls into a different category. The truth in this book is worth repeated reading as a reminder of the lessons and teaching it contains. I found the book practical and engaging with a solid mixture of personal storytelling and ready to apply information. I've read the book and also heard the audio product of this book. I highly recommend it.

1451627289|5.0|I've read many Stephen King books over the years. I'm 29 now and I guess I started reading his books when I was 16 or so. I enjoy his writing style. I guess my favorite book of his up until now was The Shining or The Long Walk. I did feel some melancholy twangs while reading 11/22/63. My good old friend whose given me so many fun hours in the unlikeliest places, like an airport or a closet at my Wisconsin boarding school, is definitely getting older. Uncle King talks older in this book. He is getting to be a wise old owl. He's so full of tricks and charm. Would I be wrong to think of this book as one of his better ones? I read Duma Key and it was good, but I like this one better. I guess it is time to check out Under the Dome. I saw the plug for that book in this one and I'll be running out to get it soon, but not before I have time to devote to it. I read this one in the space of two days as well and thoroughly enjoyed myself. My wife's due to try it next. Some of the happiest times of my life have been spent reading Stephen King books.

B002ZG974M|5.0|Our 3 1/2 year old daughter hasn't seen much television or movies.  We deliberately kept her away from it for the first few years, and are now very selective about what she sees.  The surprising thing when we started to introduce her to it in the last few months was that she had no interest.  Cartoons & Pixar movies wouldn't hold her attention for more than a few minutes.  Sesame Street episodes, (thanks to Amazon Prime) didn't do much better.  Then my wife and I saw a preview for this movie, and we ordered the DVD - with our daughter in mind.  Mom, dad & daughter all sat down to watch it.  Our little girl watched it from beginning to end without without losing interest -- something she has done with no other movie.  We paused it a few times to talk about the movie, and she was enamored with the babies on screen as soon as it started playing again.    The movie itself follows four babies from distinctly different cultures (Japan, Namibia, San Francisco & Mongolia).  We see the babies go from birth to walking.  No narrator.  No major plot points (outside of this astoundingly complex process of developing human minds).  This isn't drama, Jon & Kate or (fake) reality -- this is real reality.    This is also something we'll put on again for our daughter.  There are a lot of lessons to be had in multiple viewings.  Lessons about how babies develop.  Lessons about what siblings do for us.  Lessons about how different cultures live.  Etc.  I particularly note the importance of understanding other cultures.  This is essential because it serves as a basis for compassion.  This is something that's essential for development, and not always an easy thing to teach.    Note, that the movie is by no means graphic.  The 'birth' scenes are vague enough that they tell 'just enough' of the story.  There is one shot where you see the attached umbilical cord and you see the babies feeding with their mothers regularly (something most parents will be completely desensitized to), but that's it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy was one of the best sets of books I have read. Very intense and plays on your emotions. It really got me attached. It did give me nightmares but I would attribute that to the attachment. I felt that the characters were real people somewhere.  I didn't even think I would like the books since there aren't my usual style (mystery/horror) but I gave it a shot and will never regret it. I spent over 2 months considering this trilogy and finally gave in. Wish I had bought it sooner.
B005KN5AES|4.0|New York rockers Riot have just released their latest album and it's special for a various number of reasons: it's the band's first album in five years and it also sees the Thundersteel era line-up back together. Riot may not sound familiar but the album, Immortal Soul, is their fourteenth studio album. Based on the songs and sound, Immortal Soul is a very strong release for Riot.   Riot formed around 1975 in New York. The band experienced many changes in their line-up but guitarist Mark Reale has been the only stable member of the band. From 1977 to 1981, the band cranked out three studio albums with original singer Guy Speranza (Rock City, Narita, and Fire Down Under). The third of them, Fire Down Under, is considered by many critics to be one of the most underrated hard rock albums of the time in 1981. Speranza left in 1981 and was replaced by Rhett Forrester. With Forrester, the band made another two albums (Restless Breed and Born in America) but the band had hit rock bottom financially in 1983. Also, a band called Quiet Riot was becoming popular and confusion happened often. The band either split or kept quiet until 1986 when Reale reformed the band with a new line-up. This new line-up included Reale, singer Tony Moore, bassist Don Van Stavern, and drummer Bobby Jarzombek. This incarnation of Riot released the power metal heavy Thundersteel, which achieved some commercial attention. When the band went on tour, guitarist Mike Flyntz joined. In 1990, the band released The Privilege of Power. It was the last album with Moore and/or Stavern on it as they left in 1992. Riot continued to release new music and tour, with Reale and Flyntz as stable members (Jarzombek was in and out). In 2008, the Thundersteel line-up of Reale, Moore, Stavern, Jarzombek and Flyntz reunited.   Immortal Soul opens up quite fittingly with a song called \\"Riot\\"...by a band named Riot. It's a very smart way to happen the album up: a very speed metal oriented sound and Moore screaming the lyrics, including the chorus \\"What's it gonna take to make you riot?\\" \\"Still Your Man\\" sounds very much like a song that could've been from Thundersteel. The lyrics seem to be a sequel of sorts to the song \\"Johnny's Back\\" from Thundersteel if you remember the lyrics to it (Don't look now cause Johnny's back again/I am your man!). In this song, we are reminded of Johnny: \\"Hey Johnny, brother take my hand/I remember, I am still your man!). According to sources, Johnny is the name of Riot's seal mascot that can be seen on their album covers. Songs like \\"Crawling\\" and \\"Fall Before Me\\" are very \\"sludge\\" sounding metal tracks, which is pretty cool to hear Riot do. It's different, that's for sure. If one of these songs had to be chosen as a single, \\"Wings Are For Angels\\" would be my pick. Much like \\"Still You Man\\", it sounds like something from Thundersteel. Also on this album is the biblical \\"Sins of the Father\\" and the Iron Maiden riddled self titled track. The latter is a really good song and one of my favorites off the album. \\"Whiskey Man\\" is another interesting track. Of all the songs off the album, I can sort of imagine Guy Speranza singing it (sadly, he wouldn't be able to: he died in 2003). The album ends with the guitar-oriented \\"Echoes\\".   Immortal Soul is a very good album and it's great to see this line-up of Riot back together again. Although I do prefer Fire Down Under and Thundersteel more, Immortal Soul is basically a kick-ass heavy metal album. Welcome back, Riot!  UPDATE 1/26/2012: Mark Reale, co-founding member and guitarist for Riot, passed away yesterday from his battle with Crohn's Disease. This review is dedicated to Mark Reale. Rest in peace, Mark!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|great flick.  purchase was as expected.  this was probably the best of all the fast follow up movies, it took no brains to watch and had the stunts expected.
145551389X|1.0|I was so excited about this book, pre-ordered it in August I believe, received it on Wednesday. Sending it back today most likely. The photos are nice, some are ok, some are great - just feels like Madonna already did this. I'm a huge fan of LG but this book did not blow me away at all. The worst part is that the book's spine is already cracked and open in 3 different spots, pages are lose, the whole thing is coming undone. No way am I keeping it because of how cheaply it is made. Sad but true. Don't waste your money.

0385535139|3.0|I was disappointed in The Litigators.  The story was not compelling and the characters were not that interesting either.  David Zinc pulled this case from an obvious dismissal at the very end of the trial which is totally unbeleiveable.  I have to say that this is Grisham's worst book, so far.
0312576463|3.0|This book made for some fairly compulsive reading. I can't deny that. However, the tv show Nip/Tuck made for some very compulsive viewing, and yet I did not feel it in the least edified or uplifted or moved me in any way. The same could be said for Freedom. It is basically a superbly written soap-opera, full of two-dimensional characters who I did not like or recognize as real. I can honestly say, I did not like one character in this whole book.  Even Lalitha, the moral compass of the book, is as obsessive, needy, and absurd as the others. I understand that it is the human condition to be imperfect: obsessive, needy, and absurd. But I have 3-dimensional friends and family for that comforting reminder. I read this book in only a few sittings, but I can't say I respected myself in the morning. Still, the man is unquestionably an exceptional and rare writer. Have you read The Corrections? The writing is as great, and there is much more heart in it. And much less preaching.
B005KMX866|3.0|Over all a pleasant CD. However rock-a-billy music should have more drive, more of a raw edge to it. The CD brings back some memories, but it just didn't have what it takes for real rock-a-billy music.

B005NF2UE6|3.0|In my opinion Nickelback needs:  1) To go back to basics started in The State and The Long Road  2) a virtuoso guitarist to fill in and connect songs together  A lead guitarist can make a good song great. Anyone miss songs like \\"Photograph\\"? I can identify with that song. Nickelback became famous and dropped everything. Who told them they had to lose where they came from?
0446573019|3.0|David  Baldacci must have had some weak help in writing this book.  I found the story to be not very compelling and, quite frankly, seemed to drag along for most the book.  Certainly not up to par with his Camel Club books.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|I live in Minnesota. Here we get plenty of snow. From the first snow here, assuming it's a typical late November snowfall, to just after the holidays the snow is beautiful and, if you grew up in a location where there is winter, it is essential. After January I can come up with 50 words for snow that would not be allowed on these pages.   As for Kate Bush's 50 Words for snow I have to say I like it a great deal. I accept that once the days start growing longer in mid to late February I will probably put this recording away for 9 months. I will definitely look forward to the following November when I can pull it out again. This is not a problem. I find this record to be beautiful. I do not find it dull or pretentious. It is not a Kate Bush recording ala The Dreaming or Hounds Of Love but it is something I appreciate for its concept in the same way I love her earlier recordings. Consider the subjects. The life of a snowflake told from it's short life-span point of view; a woman whose bed is invaded by a snowman only to find it gone in the morning with only wet sheets and twigs left as forensics; old lovers reminiscing while snowed in and so on. These are typical other-worldly Kate fantasies brought to life through her music. Although the album does not showcase a lot of musical accompaniment, the ambient nuances that run through each song are very moving for me. I also have no problem with Elton John's duet with Kate. He shows a side of his singing that is not common for him although I do have to admit that I imagined Roy Harper singing the role and it worked for me.
0321784421|5.0|I've been a web designer for 4 years now, and I can honestly tell everyone from experience, HTML5 just isn't there yet.<br />Great ideas behind HTML5, its too bad almost none of them work since no one is implementing them into their browsers. For instance, the \\"video\\" tag was compatible with ogg files in firefox 3.0 and 3.5, but the current version of firefox does not support the \\"video\\" tag. If you are looking to learn web design, then HTML5 is not the way to go. Its an idea, not an industry standard. Too make matters worse, it turns new web design learners into idiots since it tries to mimic standard names that be assign to classes and divs in their code. New learners will never understand that structure without learning this stuff! Simply put, HTML5 is \\"HTML for Dummies!\\" Besides the video tag, the rest is useless. Instead focus on xhtml 1.0, it requires clean, well written code (unlike earlier HTML formats that were allowed unacceptable errors), and its code bases are compatible across all major browsers. Working with HTML5 will be extremely frustrating for new learners since most of the code is not yet compatible with major browsers. You will be entering code and wondering why its not working since you typed it exactly as it was written. Well, its not you, its the code that's the problem!<br />We have standards for a reason. If you had to have a different size bulb for every light in your house, wouldn't that be a headache? Or what if every vehicle on the road required a different form of fuel? Not Good! HTML5 doesnt look like a winner to begin with. Its been 2 and 1/2 years since heavy talk of its beginning have emerged, and yet its gone no where. Anybook that claims to teach you HTML5 is a play too line the authors pockets with money. Theres no point in learning technology that cannot be implemented in the real world. Save your money or buy an XHTML book.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Do not waste your money on this, specifically because the \\"digital copy\\" is not a digital copy at all.  It's a wretched attempt at forcing consumers to use a terribly kludgy streaming service.  You have to sign up for multiple different accounts on different no-name websites just to access the video.  Once these different sites all have your personal info and email address, then you are presented with several options to stream or \\"download\\" the video.  I quote \\"download\\" because in order to get the movie onto your computer, you have to install a bunch of applications in order to watch the video, and once the video file is downloaded it's less than half the file size of what you would get from iTunes - translation: it's less than half the image quality.  Save your money, skip this version, buy the DVD instead, and create your own digital copy from your purchased disc using any of the many LEGAL applications that rip DVDs to video files on your computer.

B004EPZ03O|5.0|I was a HUGE Muppet fan when I was a child, to the point where I nearly wore out the tapes of the three original movies (especially The Muppets Take Manhattan -- that one was my favorite!). I've dutifully watched nearly all of the Muppet movies that have come out over the years (...although I think I've missed a TV special or two), and was initially thrilled to hear that there was going to be a new movie.  And then the trailers started to come out -- and they were funny, yes, but they also made me somewhat uneasy, because the scenes they showed, out of context, just weren't selling me on the movie at all.  Still. I am a Muppet fan, so my seeing this movie opening weekend was never in any doubt. Especially after the stellar reviews started coming in. And you know what? The reviewers were right.  So the basic story is: Gary, his girlfriend Mary, and his brother Walter (a puppet, who is the Muppet's biggest fan), take a trip to LA -- ostensibly for Gary and Mary's anniversary, but also so that Walter can see the Muppet Studios. While Walter is on the tour there, he learns that an evil businessman is going to buy Muppet Studios and tear it down and drill for oil. So, Walter and company set out to reunite the Muppets (who've been retired for years) so that they can put on one last show and save their old studio.  This is a fabulous piece of nostalgia. It is sweet (and occasionally bittersweet) and funny and it had me alternating between smiling and tearing up from moment one. This is everything that made the Muppets so wonderful years ago, and was, in this Muppet fan's opinion, pretty much perfect. As cliche as it sounds? It was everything I hadn't dared to hope that this movie would be.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|We ordered Crazy Stupid Love on Amazon instant video. My hubby and I really both liked this movie. There are some great scenes that are creative and you actually feel for the characters. The character development is great! We both were laughing and worried for Steve Carell.

B005TQACLC|2.0|this would be something only a hardcore Britney fanatic would enjoy. i am not one but was curious to see how the show compared to other artist's recent shows... needless to say this show was quite boring. yes, i understand the whole thing is lipped with pre-recorded vocals but whoever mixed the audio did a really bad job. on my 5.1 surround system i had to turn the center channel up all the way to match the blaring left and right channels pumping out the studio tracks and background vocals. on certain songs u can hear her pre-recorded \\"live\\" vocals thru the center channel speaker, but faintly. i found that odd. the mixing also lacks bass to the subwoofer. i thought hey even if the show sucks i can hear the older revamped songs in great 5.1, another let down.   over all the concert was lacking the old energetic \\"wow\\" factor she used to deliver with her dancing and choreography. the video interludes were creepy and lame. lip syncing expected but the sound still isnt that good. and it shouldve included the entire concert.

Just so you know, I also LOVED Deadwood and The Tutors!!

B005HSG3U6|2.0|The only reason this product is getting two stars is because it is lightweight and it does fit the Fire well. I don't find it to be too flimsy as others do...it is similar to other tablet covers I have seen before in sturdiness.  BUT because I have seen other tablet covers...I am so disappointed in this stupid case. I've been using it for a week now and have attempted to like it, but it just isn't happening. Why? Besides protecting my device, the main thing I want from a case is for it to stand up. This will stand up...on a flat, hard surface. Just be careful not to lift it even the slightest bit or the stupid flap comes out of the slit. Other cases I have seen have a little flap on the back with velcro under it that secures the front flap in place. You can move it all you want and the stand stays in place. I would like to be able to have my device on my lap and shift it without it falling down. I don't think that is too much to ask. Maybe if I hadn't seen cases that actually work I would have liked this product. And good luck trying to get it out of the case if you decide you don't like it! I felt like I was going to break the damn thing.  It is hard to believe Amazon recommended these cases for the Fire. I expect better from Amazon.
0394818237|5.0|I had this book as a child in the 80's and I *adored* it.  I would spend hours tracing my fingers along the page, imagining Mr. Fox or Mrs. Pig as they went about their day at home, at work.    Now I have a two and a half year old son who is VERY active - very rough and tumble and does not want to sit still for a minute.  Consequently, it has been difficult to get him in one spot long enough to read or enjoy any books with him.    Then I got him a copy of Richard Scarry's What Do People Do All Day.  We've had it for about a month now, and he still spends at least a half hour to an hour a day with this book.  He does the same things I used to do: tracing his fingers along the page and making up stories about what Mr. Fox or Mrs. Pig are doing today.  And he loves it when his dad or I sit and read it or make up stories with him.  If you have a toddler that is resistant to story time - get a Richard Scarry book, especially this one!
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I admit, I purchased this for my Fire because Amazon stuck it up there as a recommended purchase to go with my Fire.  Well it almost is what I need.    1) Yes, it fits the Fire pretty well. I appreciate the light weight and the form fitting nature of the case. That's a thumbs up.  2) Elastic? I like the idea that it has something to hold it closed, but elastic?  In my experience elastic does not last very long and will get stretched out.    3) The stand.  Uhm ok, I read the other reviews and I don't know what they're doing that I'm not doing.  I prop it up and a second later... *PLOP* back down it goes...  no good.  Do it again... PLOP.  grr.  Put that also into the fact that I prefer the reading direction in the sense of it being a Kindle in the upright position, not horizontal.  Maybe its wishful thinking but I'm not happy with it.    I do plan on returning this.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|To sum this collection up for any Jurassic Park fan would be AWESOME. All 3 movies on blu-ray, they sound and look great, it reminded me of seeing them for the first time in theaters on my 52 inch television. they just look and sound awesome, bottom line. You might even be using one of these blurays to show off your sound system, it sounds that good.   The content (other than the 6 part documentary) is all the same stuff you got with the DVD Trilogy that came out forever ago. The new content, while interesting for a JP fan, might not be the most interesting thing for a normal bluray consumer, as it's all stuff you've heard about the film before, with maybe a little more depth or story behind it. (Plus seeing all the cast members again looking back at making the first film is pretty cool)  Also, if your computer can handle it, there's a voucher for the first episode of the Jurassic Park The Game series (first of four episodes). I havnt used this yet as my computer is not that great, but i did buy the full four episodes on my PS3 and have to say, if you're a huge Jurassic Park fan, it's pretty cool and the story was better than i expected. Also are the vouchers for your Digital Copy of the film, but i wont go on about them, you guys know what they're all about.  Now, the bust of the T-Rex smashing through the park gates, is pretty well done. For someone who doesnt have any Jurassic Park swag, i was way excited to get my hands on this. It's not the greatest quality, more like plastic and whatnot, but it's not a toy, it's for throwing up on a shelf and admiring. and for that, it does it's job. It looks cool, the detail is pretty awesome, and finally getting something 'Jurassic Park' for my huge collection of this sort of movie junk, is pretty sweet.   All in all, if you're a Jurassic Park fan, (this is my favorite trilogy of all time, i LOVE these movies) this is def worth the purchase. If you're buying this for just one or two of the movies and dont care about the special features or the bust, just get the normal trilogy.  Hope this was helpful =]
0446547654|4.0|I really liked the book.  While I didn't think it was as good as some of his other books, it was very interesting & held my interest.  I can't wait for his next book to come out.
0061122416|5.0|The reason I purchased this book is because I heard the actor Will Smith mention it on the Oprah Show one day. It seemed to have been a great influence in his life. It peeked my curiosity. It is not the type book I would ordinarily read, but it took me out of my usual zone and I could glean some good things from it in spite of its overall story.

B0012GMUI6|5.0|This is the truly the best Roger Waters solo album. It suberbly gells and sustains its eerie mood throughout. The writing is as brilliant as he gets-arguably far better than anything he's written since. It's not a fun ride but as intense an album as you'll get.
1935670913|5.0|I was surprised at how generous John Locke was with this \\"insider tips\\" for marketing and selling many copies of a book on Kindle. Especially good were his ideas on how to get others to enthusiastically endorse you and tell their friends about your book - to increase exposure and sales!

B005KELQEU|3.0|This is great if you're looking for something low-cost, but you might prefer something you can actually keep your Kindle in while you read.

1439192812|5.0|Thank you Dr. Dawkins once more for the delightful visit with the language and thinking.  I still love my Saturday morning Vatican news, a true guilty pleasure.
B000ICXQF6|1.0|I am amazed at anyone who thought this was a good movie. It was shallow and boring. There was nothing of any intellectual or thought provoking nature. I am always amazed at how people can be so enamored with pure drivel and then be totally bored when an in depth movie comes along. I would give it zero stars if I could.

030726999X|4.0|The last of the 3 by Stieg Larsson !! I enjoyed each of them immensely!!<br />I must admit that it takes a little while to really get into this one, but then as usual, once you arrive at that point, hang on to your hat !!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|His Christmas songs are sung beautifully.  He reminds me a bit of Bing Cosby's style, but think Michael's voice is better.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I love that she went with a more old-school vibe. Very different from what I am use to hearing on the radio.
B000T45C32|5.0|I rated this movie very high for people who feel that society prejudges and under-estimates ones ability. Perseverance pays. And even as a testimony of how not to look a gift horse in the mouth when society over-estimates you. It is all about illusion. My only complaint is that a genetically inferior man would not overcome his genetics while drinking and smoking. He would have to hide a healthy diet and execercise regime since anyone who eats healthy in our society sticks out like a sore thumb. Struggling with putting up a facad by nibling on twinkies in public while eating collard greens at home would have been much more realistic.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I like this music even better than the \\"first\\" duet cd of Tony Bennett's.  This contains some great songs and amazing artists.  I have bought three of these to share with friends.
0316098329|3.0|One of those books I'm glad I read, but will not pick up again. I thought for the most part the author succeeded with the voice of the 5-year-old throughout, but just like I would find it hard to carry on a 10-hour conversation with one, the book dragged in parts for me, especially in the beginning. I think the tedium is part of the experience of describing an existence lived in 13 x 13 ft quarters, but I didn't need the extra description for that sense of claustrophobia to come through.   Besides that, the rest of the book is almost a Hemmingway-like read in the sense that you get the 10% of what is happening and have to infer the rest, based on Jack's perceptions and conversations with adults. I sometimes don't find that very satisfying, and could have done with more fleshing out of the some of the characters in the 2nd half of the book. \\"Real Grandpa\\" for instance, is merely characterized by his repulsion to Jack--but we never really see if he gets over it or has any kind of normal relationship with his daughter and grandson.   All and all though, a fast read and one worth the time.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|This CD surprised me.  I was expecting another Amy Lee \\"adventure\\" like the Open Door.  Not that I didn't like the Open Door, but Ms Lee was trying to be more \\"artsy\\" than entertaining.  This new self-titled album is different.  It is catchy, heavier and closer to Fallen in style.  The choruses are great.  You will be humming and singing chorus lines for hours after listening because of the great hooks.  Also, the Deluxe version is well worth the extra $$.  You get four extra quality songs along with the videos and digipak.  Normally you get a real drop-off with \\"bonus\\" songs, but not in this case.  All-in-all this was a pleasant surprise.  Not as good as Fallen, but well worth the wait!

B006470HZ6|2.0|I agree with the comments that the second season is becoming a snooze fest.  The first episode of Season 2 was promising. But it went downhill from there.  I guess all the excitement left with Frank Darabont.
0307279189|5.0|It's strange how you sometimes love something so much and get great joy out of doing it but for reasons you can't remember or for maybe no reason at all you just stop doing it.      Back in the 80's(before barefoot running became popular as it is becoming today) I used to run barefoot with my older brother all the time. My other brother would come with us and hide rocks in the dirt for us to step on. Besides the pain of not paying attention and stepping on his little \\"booby-traps\\" I remember how great it felt to run barefoot.  To run with nothing between your feet and the earth. Feeling the grass, enjoying the whole experience. It's a very natural, freeing feeling. Somehow it really does connect you more with what's all around you: feeling the sunlight, hearing the birds chirping, feeling the breeze, experiencing it all directly, your senses fully engaged, without the noisy mind filtering and commenting on everything. Basically, it feels like being a kid again. Anyway, I ran like that for only a brief time. So...I wasn't even halfway through this book and I started remembering not just the joy of running but how it felt to run barefoot.      The book itself reads like a great work of fiction. It has colorful characters, a great story, and much more. McDougall really tells an adventure here. The writing is a little bit over the top but it works for me. I wouldn't exactly call this journalistic writing, and some of it may be hyperbole, but still, you can tell that he is really passionate about the subject. I couldn't stop reading it. And more importantly I was inspired by it(eek, I'm not crazy with the over-used word 'inspired' but what can you do?). Inspired enough to start running again. Yes, in my barefeet(slowly at first). How great this feels...again. If seeing someone running in their barefeet doesn't get people looking funny at me then I'm sure them seeing me grinning like an idiot from the sheer joy of running like this will.      A highly recommended book for for runners and non-runners alike and for anyone looking for that sense of bonding/community, an adventure tale, nutrition info, being passionate about something, hidden tribes(would have liked to learn more of the Tarahumara tribe), an exciting race, etc.

B002BWP49M|5.0|I loved the movie, have read all the books more than once. First time viewing I always have a problem comparing it to the book. 2nd time, I was able to enjoy the movie so much more. Most of it is very close to the book, just wished they didn't cut so much out of the movie, I would have paid to watch it for 2 hrs or more! I recommend it for all Twilight fans.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I purchased the Eclipse Movie on DVD from Amazon. I really enjoy the Twilight Saga and have read all the books. I felt like this movie followed the book and was very well directed. I really enjoyed the action and the drama. I know it is a pg-13 movie, but I feel like because of he nature of the storyline it is really for more for older more mature people.
B004R739LE|5.0|The Lowepro Orion DayPack is a high quality daypack that has enough room to hold your photography essentials plus a few other extra items such as your lunch, phone, and keys. There are plenty that I like about it, but it has a couple of minor drawbacks as well. First the positives:<br /><br />- Comfortable<br />It is very comfortable to carry around. Since aquiring it, I've used it on all my shoots. I've even used it on a few of my day hikes.<br /><br />- Roomy + Good Protection<br />The daypack consists of two compartments.<br /><br />o Bottom Compartment<br />The bottom compartment is for holding your lenses and other camera accessories. It has adjustible velcro partitions. This compartment is *very* well padded all around to protect your equipment from bumps, jostling, or even a fairly substantial drop. The interior space meatures 10.5\\" x 6 x 6 (L x W x H).<br /><br />It fits my Canon XSi (with a 17-55mm f2.8 attached) very nicely, but I have to turn my lens hood around. Because of the hassle of having to turn my lens hood around every time I put my camera back in the daypack, I prefer instead to keep my camera in the top compartment, which is a perfect fit for my camera configuration, including the lens hood.<br /><br />o Top Compartment<br />The top compartment isn't as well padded as the bottom compartment, but it offers some protection nonetheless. The internal dimensions measured at the widest points are roughly 10.5\\" x 6 x 7 (L x W x H).<br /><br />- Pockets Aplenty<br />There are two side pockets (where I keep my 77mm and 58mm B+W polarizers), two front pockets (where I put my GPS tagger and non-camera-related things such as gum and kleenex), and one big mesh pocket inside the upper compartment (where I store spare batteries, memory cards, etc.).<br /><br />- Handy Bottom Straps<br />I use the pair of straps on the bottom to strap my jacket. I don't use it to strap my tripod, however, because I find my tripod too obtrusive in the horizontal position.<br /><br />Now, I do have a couple of minor issues with the daypack. (1) It doesn't have straps for strapping the tripod vertically onto the daypack. (2) There isn't an external pocket large enough to hold a water bottle.<br /><br />---<br />Overall, the Lowepro Orion DayPack has exceeded my expectations. I love it and use it very frequently. If you're looking for a high quality camera bag, this one is well worth considering.<br />Now, I do have a couple of minor issues with the daypack.

B006ANJ4BW|1.0|This movie is not good, it is your generic, fast paced, action movie.   I find it very amusing that an Austrian body builder with little acting experience in 1982 was able to bring such vast depth to the character of Conan. The lead roles in this plot less version are shallow at best. Conan's whole quest was due to his father's murder, in John Milius's version Conan had a lot more to be mad about, his family and village destroyed and then he is put into slavery pushing a wooden wheel for twenty years. Then the antagonist kills Conan's Queen. The clown in this version was just not convincing, the only battle training Conan received was from his father. While in the original, Conan was sent to the oriental War Masters to learn to become a great warrior, he was also forced into reading and writing. Jason momoa or whatever his name is would surprise me if he actually knew how to read. Again in the original Conan was not a lone wolf, he had friends who would die for him and together they brought down Thulsa Doom. In this version the antagonist is not quite as frightening as James Earl Jones, not quite as potent. Stephen Lang looked like an overly adorned fool. There was no character development and the movie was very loud and looked more like 'The Mummy\\". They substituted acting and plot for special effects and noise. There was also almost no allusion to the original works of Robert E. Howard. Stick with Arnold, even Conan the Destroyer was a better film than this bore.

What these men had to go through amazes me and I watch these movies so I can get a better idea of what they had to go through.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|I am adding my voice to the masses.  People who are about to buy this product need to know what they are actually buying as I was duped by the words \\"digital copy\\".  It was a lie.

B005V20JKI|4.0|this is great fun, works awesome on my galaxy tab, graphics are good, characters are well made and animated.<br /><br />however, this game is a near perfect re-skinning of a indy game called &quot;super crate box&quot; which is identical in almost every way aside from the graphics and the names of things.<br /><br />they are both great games but if you like this one give super crate box a try on your PC, it's free. ;-)<br /><br />all in all i have to give it a 4 out of five because it honestly didnt add anything to the concept of super crate box, if they had taken the idea and run with it turned it into a little bit different game it would have been a solid 5. For just reskinning another game and not adding anything new? only gets a 4 sorry.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Classic Megadeth is how I would describe this album.<br />Public Enemy Number 1 is a great single and also contains a hilarious video clip that involves Monkeys... this goes to show that the man who was too maniacal for Metallica still has an awesome sense of humour.<br /><br />I would say that this album is definitely an improvement from \\"Endgame\\" and is a step in the right direction for Hard Rock / Heavy / Thrash Metal.<br />While other large \\"BIG 4\\" Thrash / Heavy Metal bands work on collaborations that fail horribly (I'm not even going to mention that pathetic album) or concept albums, Mustaine and Megadeth shine with a back to the Roots effort.<br /><br />The solo by Chris Broderick in \\"Public Enemy Number 1\\" is probably the best solo I've heard out of Megadeth since Friedman and \\"Tornado Of Souls\\"<br /><br />I hope Megadeth keep on churning out the good stuff while other bands seem stagnant or stuck, Megadeth continues to produce and deliver.<br /><br />Support Megadeth! Buy the album!

B00005RHGK|5.0|This is a very good movie. I loved how it took place. Two teenagers were driving in a desolace country road and come across an old abandon church with this creature living in it. Storing bodies of people in the basement of the church. The creature then follows the teenagers and attempts to kill them, and also attacks the police station and other residents around the area.  This is a pretty spooky movie. I've watched it many times. It never seems to get old for me.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|very good film. I was really surprised it would be this good. It is one of my favorite movies. \\"there are only two types of people, good or bad\\"....is a wonderful quote Khan's mother taught her disabled son. I wish more people would be this generous, loving and caring.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|I have purchased many dvds and blu rays from Amazon over the years with no issue.  I am completely appalled by the quality of the Harry Potter blu rays I received.  I purchased them as a gift for family members.  Half of the discs don't work, others skip throughout the movie.  I've tried countless other blu ray discs and other players.  I am confident that it is the discs.    Additionally, the discs don't have menus, scene selection, etc.  Which makes me seriously question the quality from which they came.  I was under the assumption that these were official Warner Bros Blu Ray discs, but the manner in which they appear makes me think otherwise.

0553801473|2.0|While I would often express my frustration at the author and the pace of the series (A Dance of Dragons taking over ten years to complete after the preceeding volume), I always thought I had the book to look forward to.  I hardly expected to be critical of the book, the author maybe, but not the book.  After all THIS was the follow up to a Storm of Swords!  One of the best fantasy books written in my opinion and which I highly reviewed for Amazon.<br /><br />So, no spoilers... if you have followed this series you should read this, ahm, book, that much is plain.  There are a couple of gems within in terms of individual scenes, and some surprises/answers to set questions from the earlier books.  But there is no over-riding interest factor, and two thirds of the way through the book it was clear that there was no reason to continue reading other than that I had read all the previous books in the series.<br /><br />At the rate Martin puts these things out, recently anyway, like one book every six years or so, I will probably not read the next one in the series, or I will wait till a day when I have the flu and it is in cheap paperback (or kindle).<br /><br />After ten years of waiting with a excitement, I no longer care a wit about the characters or the plots in this series.
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|On the one hand, I'm not a big fan of monster movies that keep the monster mostly out of sight or hard to see throughout the movie. But knowing that was the formula that JJ Abrams used for [[ASIN:B0018QCXGY Cloverfield]], my expectations were set for that...and my expectations where met. At least the Cloverfield hand held camera part of the formula was dropped for Super 8.<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm a big fan of a well written and well acted story. While Super 8 was full of moments that were simply not believable, the story flow and the amusing but accurate capture of how a group of middle schoolers interact with each other saved Super 8 from 2 star land.<br /><br />My kids loved Super 8. Although I'd hesitate to call it a great 'family' film simply based on some of the mature material and language. It's actually refreshing to see the MPAA take a more lax approach to language with a PG-13 instead of an R. I suppose having Steven Spielberg on board as producer may have had some pull.<br /><br />Basically a bunch of kids in a remote town are witness to a military train crash. Unfortunately one of the passengers on the train really wants to go home but that's not where the train was taking him...er...I mean...It. But when the train crashes this 'dark' passenger has a chance to escape and the kids do a better job of tracking down the escaped passenger than the most qualified government agency ever could. Now there's a formula that never seems to get old in Hollywood, right?...Smart civilians and kids outwit the dumb old police and military. Oy.<br /><br />So overall I was entertained by Super 8, but I walked away feeling like it was a kid's movie in PG-13 clothing.
B0054JELS4|5.0|Exactly what I would have purchased at any store selling DVD's except I saved 25%. Would recommend this purchase to anyone desiring the NCIS set.
B0058VW36U|5.0|please update the other app store has the updated version with 25 more levels. I wanna get 75 more stars.
B004EPYZQ2|1.0|Steven Spielberg has lost his touch for a long time now.  This is a terrible film.  The actors (kids) were very good.  This is one of those films that rarely shows you anything and use darkness to hide things instead of spending the money to show you.  I absolutely think this is one of the worst films of the year.  Please do not buy this.
B005OZE9SA|3.0|I use this little guy in connection with my DAW and digital piano.  I run the piano sounds through balanced cables into the line-in ports for recording, and I also run VST intruments on my DAW that I trigger via USB MIDI from the piano and use this device for digital/audio conversion.  I listen through Sennheser HD 595 headhphones plugged in to this and I also have some studio monitors attached using balanced cables.<br /><br />I purchased this to upgrade from my previous audio interface, the Behringer UF0202.  That device worked quite well for this purpose as well but lacked two things: a volume knob, and balanced in/outs.  The volume knob thing I could work around, but my current monitors seem susceptible to ground loops (even with a ground lift plug), so I needed to go with balanced cables.  I'm glad I did.  The balanced cables completely eliminated my noise problems.  This was a good purchase.  However, I would say to anyone who doesn't need balanced cables and is on a budget that they should consider the Behringer.  It's a tiny fraction of the price and it works pretty well.  Further, it's class complaint so you don't have to use Behringer's drivers.  It's plug-and-play.<br /><br />I have some good things to say about the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (all about the hardware) and some bad things (all about the software).  I've tried using the driver version 2.1, which came with the disk, and the udpated 2.2, which I downloaded from Focusrite's website.<br /><br />To let you know what I need in an interface:<br /><br />1. Balanced stereo in/out<br />2. High quality headphone amp<br />3. Volume knobs for headphone amp and for the main line<br />4. Good digital-to-analog conversion<br />5. Low output latency (input latency not important to me)<br /><br />I don't use the Mic preamps, which is one of the big selling points of this device.<br /><br />================ The Good ====================<br /><br />This box is simple and well-designed.  It does what you want, has very convenient controls, and has high build quality.  I'm pleased with the digital-to-analog conversion.  It has a great big volume knob and another for the headphone amp.  It has switches so each input can be a line-in or microphone pre-amp.  It has a switch for zero-latency monitoring (of whatever is coming in).<br /><br />* The headphone amp was of particular concern for me.  I use headphones a lot and a poor headphone amp can be quite a problem.  The Behringer headphone amp was only ok.  Specifically, it has an output impedance of 50 ohms.  The rule of thumb for good headphone/amp matching is that the output impedance should be 1/8 the impedance of the headphones--my hd 595's have 50 ohms of impedance.  Breaking this rule you get distortions of the frequency response.  In my case mostly this meant attenuation of the bass.  Most manufacturers don't list their output impedance, possibly because they are embarrassed.  Anyway, Focusrite does, which is one reason I trust them a little more.  The output impedance is less than 10 ohms--respectable but not amazing.  Still not as low as I would need in principle but I can notice an improvement in the bass response in my headphones.  There's plenty of extra voltage here too, so I could drive higher impedance cans if necessary.  Anyway, good headphone amp.  Check.<br /><br />* Balanced ins and outs work very well,  The ins accommodates a 1/4 TRS style in and XLR.  The light around them shows when something's actually coming in and shines red when it's in danger of clipping.  There's lots of gain available.  I have them turned all the way down almost.  The outs are TRS style (balanced or unbalanced) and are located on the back.<br /><br />* I like the look of the box, with a red metal case, and the front and back are sturdy and attractive as well.<br /><br />* The USB cable is just a type B port.  This means you can replace it if it gets damaged or whatever.  The Behringer, for example, was hard-wired to its cable...king ofannoying.<br /><br />* It's bus-powered.  I actually would have been fine with a wall-wart, but this is even more simple.<br /><br />I really have no complaints whatsoever about the hardware.<br /><br />===================== The Bad =========================<br /><br />The driver for this thing is horrible under Windows XP.  I have a clean installation with nothing installed except my DAW software, acrobat reader, and this driver.  I mean, my computer is really stripped down.  Performance using the Behringer was good.  The latency (time between playing a note and hearing it out the speakers) was 8 ms using the Behringer, which isn't really perceptible.<br /><br />Unfortunately the focusrite driver, though it's technically ASIO apparently, doesn't have anything like an acceptable latency.  The lowest latency I could set it at and get sound out instead of crackles and pops was 23 ms.  At that level the instrument begins to sound very sluggish and laggy.  It's very difficult, at least for me, to work with a large latency like that.<br /><br />I was ready to return this device when I decided as a last ditch effort to install ASIO4ALL.  That's sort of an ASIO driver to use if you absolutely cannot make the manufacturer's driver perform at a decent level.  I installed it and it worked.  The output latency was a tiny 4.3 ms (only .3 of which are actually output latency, so this is REALLY impressive).  I conclude that the hardware is very, very good in this machine, but the software is horrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you can't actually uninstall the focusrite driver because otherwise windows doesn't recognize the device and it never even turns on--it's not class compliant, unlike the Behringer.  So now I have two drivers for it installed, only one of which I use.<br /><br />The bad news is that this configuration is very buggy.  In general when I just turn the computer on and try and play my VST instrument, all I get is crackles and pops until I open the ASIO configuration panel and increase the buffer.  The funny thing is that it doesn't matter where the buffer starts out, I always have to increase it before I get any good sounds out.  I can start it out with a huge buffer--lots of latency--and it will crackle until I open it and increase the buffer yet more.  I have to do this every time I turn on the computer.  Also, sometimes if I leave it on for a while and come back, it will be crackly again until I increase it yet another step. We are talking about major bugs here.<br /><br />I decided to try ditching ASIO4ALL and trying to make the focusrite drivers work again--maybe there was a setting I was missing.  As I was trying to set the buffer size, I heard the sound of an explosion and then my computer rebooted.  When it came back I couldn't get good sounds out, even when I turned the buffer way up.  Tried rebooting a few more times, still didn't work.  So I uninstalled and re-installed the focusrite software.  At first it didn't work.  I had to install ASIO4ALL as well, and now I can sort of get sounds out of it, half the time.<br /><br />I hope you are getting the idea.  These drivers are terrible.  Awful.  A monkey could have written a better driver.  I would give it 1 star if it wasn't for the fact that the device works very, very well when all the stars align and the driver recognizes the drive and allows it to play.  I guess I'm willing to sacrifice convenience and stability for nice hardware when it works.  I would never use this in a live situation or when time is critical.<br /><br />The good thing about drivers is that they can update and fix them.  I'm hoping for that.  They have already revised the driver once, which is amazing because even the 2.2 driver is seriously an abomination, just like the 2.1.<br /><br />================ Closing Thoughts =======================<br /><br />Unfortunately, there really isn't a USB interface that has a good driver.  The Behringer driver always worked, but if you moved the interface from one USB port to the other, it was no longer recognized and you had to reinstall the driver.  However, you didn't have to use the Behringer driver and ASIO4ALL would give you 11 ms and perform without any complications.  That's about as trouble free as I've seen in this type of device.<br /><br />If you read about the Presonus Audiobox USB and the M-Audio Fast Track Pro (probably the two closest competitors to this focusrite), what you get is a bunch of comments just like this one...horrible, horrible drivers that never get fixed. Actually Mackie makes a competitor as well, the Onyx Blackjack--but the reviews of that show that the driver is possibly even worse than this one. Unfortunately none of the pro music manufacturers cares about their drivers, so we have to live with unstable systems that only work half the time.  Maybe it's better under mac.  I don't know.<br /><br />Interestingly, this is really the only USB 2.0 device in this range.  That's quite shocking considering how long the USB 2.0 standard has been around.  The only real implication of this is that the USB 1.1 devices like the M-Audio and Presonus can only do two channel 24/96 audio in OR out, not both at the same time.  There's not enough throughput in USB 1.1.<br /><br />So in light of the competition, the Focusrite looks kind of ok.  Unfortunately all audio interface manufacturers--at least in this range of device--think there's no need for good hardware and (especially) good software.  At least the hardware in this one is up to spec.  We can cross our fingers for improved drivers in the future.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a fantastic, 5-star device...if you can make the software work consistently.<br /><br />If you are on a tight budget or don't care about balanced in/out, I'd recommend you go with the Behringer UCA202 or UFO2020.  They are tons cheaper, class complaint, and have better drivers.  If you use a high impedance headphone with it, even the headphone amp is pretty good on that one.<br /><br />================ Update May 2012 ==============<br /><br />A new version of the driver, 2.3, came out since the writing of the above.  The new driver actually works.  I have stopped using ASIO4ALL and I get decent latency.  Once in a while--not too often--it will inexplicably require me to edit the settings and increase the buffer, and some percentage of the time when I do that it will reboot my computer.  If I don't change anything, most of the time, it works ok.  I would never use this in a mission-critical setting (i.e., gigging or pro work), but for my home use, it's good enough now.  If you have issues with the driver, definitely update.tion panel and increase the buffer.

0385339682|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author developed the characters splendidly and interestingly.  The major characters were there and the minor characters moved thru the story with ease.  The major plots were well woven and the sub plots popped up when we least expected them.    The story is well told from a first person narrative,  in a time when many of us came of age.  The mid sixties and early seventies were turbulent times with the Vietnam War and segregation, especially in the South.  But this is where the story lives and grows and blooms.    I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get in a quiet place with a glass of ice tea and  let themselves drift away to another time - not so far away.
0553382152|5.0|GREAT book!! Warms the heart, lifts the spirit, good for EVERYONE. I bought a copy to share, and one to keep (after not getting the first copy back when I loaned it out). My copy is for me to underline and highlight the things I want to remember the most.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This is a great game! It takes about a minute to get used to and then it is very difficult to put down! There are some flaws, like it crashes occasionally and sucks up battery life, but it is WORTH it. Love the upgrades, don't understand the raging bull benefit so much. Still figuring it out after hours of play, but that's okay :)
B0034G4P7Q|1.0|why would anyone want to make this movie? Because Facebook is a success? Why not make a movie about the inception of Yahoo or Google, then? or even that Oracle guy for that matter! Because it'd have been dull. Well, this movie is dull and just blah, blah, blah of intellectual debates and conversations! completely pointless!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The timing of Ms. Collin's trilogy couldn't be better with the Occupy movement inflaming long suppressed feelings in the US about class distinctions and inequality.  As a work of social and political fiction, it has ignited my interest more than anything I have read in recent years. And Ms.Collins manages the political content without ever appearing to get on a soap box.  I am currently on the third book, \\"Mockingjay\\" which starts a little slow compared to the first two.  Ms. Collin's heroin, Katniss, is one of the most interesting woman characters I have encountered, rivaling Ayla in Jean Auel's \\"Cave Bear\\" series.  She is a reluctant participant in events much bigger than her personal world.  She also displays the 'woods smart' savvy and focus forced on her by her circumstances (e.g. feeding her family) while retaining some of the emotional issues of a teenage girl.  Ms. Collins also does a fine job balancing the front stories of the political and social events with the back stories of Katniss's family and friends.   I predict that when the movie comes out next year, it will get a lot of media attention due to its political implications.  When I wrote the preceeding part of this review, I was about 1/3 way through the third book. The third book starts out slowly and Katniss seems to have become a little flakey as a character.  I wondered if Ms. Collins had run out of plot and ideas.  Then things pick up and Mockingjay adds the most complex themes of all three novels.  For example that sometimes it is difficult to know if you are doing right or wrong or to know for sure what the truth is. Not wanting to leave spoilers, I will just say that the ending was satisfying to me and all the major plot threads are resolved. The point is graphically made that the only real legacy that violence leaves is more violence.
B004FQX59I|4.0|It looks back on a disturbing moment in my personal history (I was only four years old) and the countries history with some feeling of the times.

B004EPZ07U|5.0|Is Green Lantern going to be included in a list of the greatest movies of all time?  No.  Is it a bad movie? Far from it.  Green Lantern did a respectable job of telling the origin story of the character and maintained a pretty good flow for an action film.  I think there are lessons to be learned for when (hopefully) WB makes the sequel, but this is a must have film for any fans of Comic Films, Sci Fi, or Action movies.
B000002I2I|5.0|\\"Morrison Hotel\\" #4 (1970).  After the m.o.r. performance on \\"The Soft Parade\\", they switched gears to a tougher bluesier sound.  Everyone knows the anthem \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" #50, still a favorite.  \\"Waiting For The Sun\\", classic Doors, Krieger's guitar is smoking.  \\"You Make Me Real\\", Morrison shines here, good rocking' track.  \\"Peace Frog\\", the keyboards by Manzarek, Krieger's guitar  and Morrison's hip poetry are the highs.  The nice lovely ballad \\"Blue Sunday\\", the bouncy \\"Ship Of Fools\\" and the fun loving \\"Land Ho!\\".  \\"Queen Of The Highway\\" and \\"Indian Summer\\" are special deep album cuts.  \\"Maggie M'Gill\\", is blues rock the Doors way.  They released a live album in late '70, before coming out with \\"L.A.  Woman\\" in '71.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I rely on color note for my \\"list of lists\\". I set notes up for different categories of things. can cross off as I go along without losing the original list, & can reactivate any item if I need to. Would be helpful if the last save date did not completely overwrite the original creation date.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't think I would like this, as I am  more a fan of his scary books like IT and the Stand. I was blown away at how good it was though and how the book had me engaged. I have to say, not only is this one of my favorite Stephen King novels, it may be one of my favorite. It is like a historical fantasy/science fiction book all in one. And since IT is one of my favorite books as well, I loved the reference to it.
B000V6BE6M|3.0|Well, I'm not gonna go into detail about every track. The music is great... but it's not worth the price of admission. This is what I will talk about in this review.  Let's compare this soundtrack with another magnificent sublime soundtrack: \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (Collector's Edition 2004). Both soundtracks are great and unique, I will not say there is one better than the other... for me and most soundtrack lover's, they're equally great.  Although \\"Empire\\" is not a COMPLETE music release, nothing musically important is missing. It has 2 CD's, a poster and a total running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes approx. The cost? 16 dollars.  Now... let's turn to \\"Return of the King\\" (Complete Recordings). The first thing that really blows you away is the amount of songs on this album, then there is the DVD and the booklet with the development of the leitmotifs from each character/place, etc. Really neat. It has 4 CD's and a total running time of 3 hours and 30 minutes approx.; 1 hour and 15 minutes more music than \\"Empire\\" approx. The cost? It started at 75 dollars. Now it's at 60.  Still, it's not worth that much for me. The DVD has the same music than the CD's and I know I will not be playing it frequently. It just offers a 5.1 surround sound experience, that's the only difference. The booklet can be nice to look at and read it once, or twice... then it's just destined to gather dust and become a nice souvenir from the soundtrack.  Let's face it, if you are buying a soundtrack what you really care for is the music that blows you away (the same music you'll be playing over and over again).  Talking about costs in music, compared to \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\", for 1 hour and 15 minutes (the length of one CD) they're charging you 44 dollars at the end of 2011. I think they're just being cruel with all the LOTR fans out there. If they want to have the entire trilogy, they would need to invest 180 dollars today, compared to the 48 dollars needed to own the entire Star Wars Trilogy 2004 Collector's Edition.  And of course, not all 53 songs on \\"Return of the King\\" blow you away... personally, I like about 20 songs on this album (which amounts like 1h:45min of a sublime listening experience):  1. The Grace of Undomiel  2. The Lighting of the Beacons  3. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields  4. Osgiliath Invaded  5. Return to Edoras  6. Flight from Edoras  7. The Eagles  8. The Sacrifice of Faramir  9. The Houses of Healing  10. The Fellowship Reunited  11. For Frodo  12. Master Meriadoc, Swordthain  13. The Crack of Doom  14. Elanor  15. Eowyn's Dream  16. Journey to the Grey Heaven's  17. Bilbo's Song  18. The Passing of Theoden  19. A Far Green Country  20. Dernhelm in Battle  So, in summary, these pieces of music on this album are amazing (five stars) and sum up almost 2CD's of incredible music. There are many other songs in here that just help fill the 4CD's to make this a COMPLETE RECORDINGS... is it necessary? I think not. Must they charge more for the additional music, the booklet and the DVD with the same music? Of course. But should they charge so much for it? NO!!  I would give it 5 stars if they charged a more fair price to it (around 40-45 dollars), but right now I think they're just abusing the loyalty of LOTR fans out there. I mean, just take another example: Paul McCartney's concert \\"Good Evening New York City\\" has 2DVD's (REAL DVD's with images also, not just sound) + 2CD's... it costs 15 dollars. This only demonstrates just how much money guys from LOTR's must be making... they're taking advantage of all soundtrack and LOTR's aficionados. Like another reviewer stated, they know they'll equally sell it. And this is the problem. If we continue to buy this at such unfair price, they'll never charge us what's fair.
B000002I27|4.0|\\"Strange Days\\" #3  (1967).  \\"Strange Days\\", released late 1967, is not quite as good as their debut, but it has some good stuff none the less.  You get one of my personal favorites \\"Strange Days\\", love the Manzarek keyboards in this song.  The 11:00 epic \\"When The Music's Over\\", the frantic \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\", the #12 hit \\"People Are Strange\\", \\"Moonlight Drive\\", is a masterpiece.  The #25 hit in \\"Love Me Two Times\\" and the spooky \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\", which reminds me a lot of an early Twilight Zone episode.  Album number 3 comes out in 8 months.
1933633867|1.0|First off, the author is an anthropologist, not an economist or someone else with more than a passing familiarity with financial products or even theory.  This book is not a \\"history\\" of the treatment of debt or credit, it is a long-winded, twisting theory about how capitalism enslaves us.<br /><br />Just to set the mood for the entire book, the author starts it with a charming anecdote from 2000 about how he had to educate a clueless young lass on the basis for his noble activism urging the urging the IMF to \\"forgive\\" third world dictatorships' loans.  You may recall that pleasant movement's marches in the streets in 2000 and early 2001, where they displayed such catchy slogans as \\"Workers Unite\\" and \\"Smash Captalism.\\"  Yes, within 5 pages, the author will remind you of every 19 year old Sociology major you ever met, except that he never grew up, and every page of this book will remind you of that fact.  It's never a good sign when the introduction of a book causes one to think of feminine-hygiene products.<br /><br />Instead of an actual analysis of various cultures' treatment of credit and debt, the author jumps from place to place in every other sentence, treating you to his brilliant theories of everything from how capitalism was really just a tool to impose slavery to how money was only created to make people work to pay taxes.  Yes, I am simplifying a bit, but sadly, not that much.  The book never goes more than a paragraph or two in depth for each society, and the breadth of societies the author chooses are fairly narrow.  Think \\"Africa\\" and \\"Debt-Enslaved Indigenous Peoples.\\"  There's no relation to modern society, other then the author's ham-handed attempt to equate capitalism with slavery, so there's really no good reason to even read the book.<br /><br />Save your money, it isn't worth your time.  If, for some reason, you're still curious on this author's theories, go down to a college coffee shop.  Sit next to the pretty young thing with the Che shirt on and ask her how she feels about New York banks.  You will most likely hear the same theories, and you won't have to pay anything for it (only a fascist would offer to pay for a young lady's drinks).  You will most likely enjoy the company more, as well.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I guess the author didn't appreciate being compared to feminine hygiene products, so Mr. Graeber dropped in to the comments on the review to point out that I am a \\"complete fool\\" and a \\"brainless right wing idiot,\\" because the WSJ and Financial Times liked it (or asked him to write an op/ed), and if they liked it (or asked him to write an op/ed), then it must be conservative approved.  I guess that clears up my misconceptions about his masterpiece.<br /><br />But seriously, check out Graeber's comments if you have any doubts that the author's intent in writing this book.  Graeber actually said he \\"set up\\" Occupy Wall Street, as a more \\"democratic, horizontal\\" group.  Yes, that's pretty much the academic double-speak you can expect in Debt: The First 5,000 Years.  To prove he wasn't involved with one specific socialist group, the author makes a laughable claim to have \\"set up\\" another socialist group, and doesn't even realize he's telling his readers that the group he claims to have \\"set up\\" basically consists of irresponsible kids dedicated to trying to get out of their own debt.  As crazy as that sounds, there is a certain logic to Graeber's assertion.  Debt: The First 5,000 Years was written based on the muddled thesis that our capitalistic society was somehow constructed to keep people in perpetual servitude, tied up in chains of debt.  Pretty standard fare in most \\"academic\\" institutions, but your view of that theory probably depends in large part on whether you happen to be a man-child with six figures of student loan debt or an underwater mortgage you bought in 2006 thinking you'd get rich.  If you're one of them, and Occupy Wall Street is your cup of tea, then does Mr. Graeber have the book for you!  (See the comments to hear how strongly some folks personally identify with Graeber's thesis.)<br /><br />Just in case you're curious as to the author's comments, but not curious enough to read through two pages of rants from his academic fans, here's what the author had to say in his own words:<br /><br />Yes, I haven't really been following the Amazon conversations lately, snowed as I am, but this review is so amusing I can't really help myself. The reviewer doesn't seem to be aware he's making a complete fool of himself. I especially like the way he whisks an imaginary friendly audience into existence by saying anyone who reads a couple pages will surely agree with him, and therefore, the fact that the overwhelming majority of web reviewers and commentators, whether here or on other venues (e.g., Goodreads) actually come to the exact opposite conclusion as his must be some sort of statistical anomaly. I.e., the way there seem to be 55 crazed left-wing extremists to every 11 \\"average people\\" who browse Amazon pages, judging by reaction to his own \\"review.\\" I guess normal people just have trouble, somehow, hitting that helpful/unhelpful button.<br /><br />The accusation of being involved in \\"ANSWER-type groups\\" is especially funny. In fact my most widely known political intervention was to join with fellow anarchists to _fight_ ANSWER (or the crazy Stalinist group that founded ANSWER, anyway), so as to be able to set up the nascent Occupy Wall Street movement on a democratic, horizontal basis instead.<br /><br />Finally, just to show that there is a difference between an intelligent conservative open to ideas and a brainless right-wing idiot, I might note that the book has inspired positive reviews, or requests for the writing of op-ed columns, or both, from the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Business Week, and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Funny that none of them noticed the book was obvious Marxist garbage. Good thing we have this anonymous poster on Amazon to show them all the error of their ways.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I was looking for a case for my long awaited upgrade from my crappy old sprint phone to the my new iPhone 4S.   Pros  + Surprisingly Great Protection  + Classy Color/Look/Design  + Great Value  + Free Screen Protector  + Works Great With iPhone 4S  Cons  - Attracts Fingerprints After A While (Screen Protector/Case)  For the price I paid for it, this case does much better than I could ever hope for. My iPhone is protected and looks good. My iPhone is white and the color of the case alters the look, but lets the whiteness of the phone shine through so it looks classy. As careful as I've been, I've still managed to drop my phone a few times and once from a ridiculously scary situation onto the sidewalk, screen facing down. The contour of the case along with the plastic absorbed the hit and since the case comes out a little around the screen, kept the screen from ever touching the ground. There are a few cons though. The case, after a while, attracts fingerprints. The inside of the case has a matte finish, while the outside is smooth plastic. I would've preferred flipping that so the outside was matte and the fingerprints wouldn't be a problem at all. Also, the screen protector is a major fingerprint attractor after a few weeks. I'd recommend buying a different screen protector along with this case.  I'd recommend this strongly, unless you have a special preference to having an expensive case. For the value it is at, it is worth triple or quadruple its price.

Krieger on \\"Spanish Caravan\\", is classic.  \\"Five To One\\", is one tough rocker.  Just to much filler overall, which they did again a year later on \\"The Soft Parade\\".
034552554X|5.0|I belong to an informal book club of 5 friends.  We choose our books based on our interests at the time, not on recommendations from a book store.  So, we have read some bummers.  We hit the jackpot this time.  The story in The Language of Flowers is fresh for someone like me who has only a sketchy idea of the foster care system.  But the real enjoyment came from the way it is written and the way flowers are used by the main characters to communicate.  The author keeps you wondering the secret each person holds which made this a compelling, need to know, won't be happy until I know the end kind of book.  Thank you to Vanessa Diffengaugh!

0920668372|5.0|This book is one of the best childrens book EVER! If you have a tolddler... any child really, this is a must have heartwarming book. My daughter, 3, loves this book, it is her favorite. I had it when my oldest, 13, was a baby and she still reads it. My other two children 6, and 8, also enjoy reading it and it being read to them. I am very delighted with this book.
B000002I2M|5.0|\\"L.A. Woman\\"  #9  (1971).  Who would of known this would be Jim Morrison's last album with The Doors.  As it turns out we get more top notch Doors tunes in,  the hit \\"Love Her Madly\\" #11,  the crushing \\"The Changeling\\", the blues of \\"Been Down So Long\\", the shuffler \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\",  the 8 minute epic title track, the spacey \\"L'America\\", Manzarek's keyboards are spooky good.  \\"Hyacinth House\\", is solid but the weakest track on the album,  \\"Crawling King Snake\\", is the John Lee Hooker remake, Morrison made it his own.  \\"The Wasp (Texas Radio And The Big Beat)\\", is pure Doors, good rocker and they close out the Morrison era with the classic jazz/rock fusion of \\"Riders On The Storm\\" #14, what a song.  Great final album by the original group.

B003M30T9Y|5.0|I may not be Janelle Monae's typical audience for listening to or buying her albums (I rarely listen to modern music--particularly R&B) but I know great music when I hear it.  The incredible energy exhibited in this exhilarating album combines multiple musical genres that place this artist well beyond the easy confines of modern-day R&B.  Instead, Archandroid features a wide diversity of music with references to Claude Debussy, James Brown and Michael Jackson.  Despite such divergent musical stylings from one track to the next, the album works.  While some could argue that the final track of BaBobBaYa, a symphonic work, is somewhat indulgent, or that a listener may not like a certain track or two due to personal taste, on the whole this is a fantastic album.  Further, knowing that Janelle can dance like James Brown on Letterman or perform in a formal setting at Emory University (both clips on YouTube) goes to show that Janelle is not a one-album wonder.  This artist is a treasure with great opportunities for future masterworks.  Just buy the album already and join those who appreciate and reveal at great music.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was just one of those books you did not want to end, it was that good.  The characters were so well developed and the story was so gripping that I just didn't want to put this one down at all-but yet I wanted to savor it becasue I didn't want it to end.  I think this may well be one of Stephen's best books ever--although very different from his \\"horror\\" stories.  I also loved the ending--I could just picture Jake and Sophie dancing and the years between them didn't matter.  I don't want to ruin this review with spoilers, all I can say is, if you are looking for an absoutely fantastic book--search no further.<br />Congrats on the new grandbaby Stephen!

0385344325|4.0|It is March 1997, six months before the beginning of Killing Floor (Child's first novel), and Reacher, still a Major in the military police, is sent undercover to Carter Crossing, Mississippi after a woman has her throat cut behind a bar, just down the road from a large Army base that may be home to some secretive Special Forces squads. The local county sheriff, an attractive woman and former US marine, is getting nowhere with her investigation; is the Pentagon stonewalling her? Or is she not that keen to find the killer herself? Reacher is stuck in the middle, questioning everything, and unsure who to trust.<br /><br />The Affair is a return to form from Child, after the underwhelming Worth Dying For. It's fascinating to get some insight into the enigmatic Reacher's back-story, particularly his Army days. Plenty of action and thrills, some intriguing characters; it's a very good read.
1451648537|5.0|This is a balanced, well written and comprehensive review of the life of Steve Jobs. I especially liked the fact that it was not sugar coated. Those of us who worked in the Silicon Valley in the '80's recognized Mr. Jobs as a tough task master, fanatic about details, a genius for anticipating the future direction of technology, having discriminating taste, but not always a \\"nice person\\".  Walter Isaacson does a great job of presenting Job's role in the exciting burst of creativity that was taking place at the time, and the intriguing stories of the relationships among Apple, NeXT, Pixar and Disney. I also enjoyed reading about how the various power struggles and changes in power positions between Jobs and Sculley, Amelio, Eisner, et al took place.

0451232577|5.0|Depsite the many crybabies who trashed the book because of the outrageous e-price, this book deserves a better review than that.  A lot of research and work was put into this novel and Follett delivers strong characters moving through an excellent story of life before, during and after WWI.  Can't wait for the next in the series.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|This DVD for the Femme Fatale tour by Britney Spears is a great idea for the fans and people whom were waiting a DVD since her last tour back in 2009 and is a great moment for having such a cool DVD cause the Album is amazing and the set list is quite well thinking and the tour set list even more.   She's definitely one of the best artist in the world and a great performer. If you like Britney, you will love this concert.  We all know how was the preparation for this but if you have any negative comment about the details, we all have too but we just step that aside and continue enjoying the show.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|SUPER 8 is writer/director J.J. Abrams' paen to Spielberg and even a gentle nod to King's STAND BY ME.  In essence, the coming-of-age theme overshadows the sci-fi elements and provide the film's heart.<br />Set in 1979, the story follows the misadventures of a group of teens bonded by friendship and their attempt to make their own zombie movie for a contest.  Things heat up when a train crash results in the release of an extraterrestrial creature.<br />The young actors are superb, especially Elle Fanning and Josh Courtney.  Fanning has an uncanny maturity and lovely innocence that prophesizes a great future in films.  Just savor her marvelous \\"transformation\\" to a zombie--it's priceless.  And marvel at Courtney when he stands up in hurt defiance at his stern father.  You feel his anguish.  Kyle Chandler (Friday Night Lights) and Ron Eldard (Blind Justice) are outstanding in non-cliche roles as the fathers.<br />The special fx are good but I would have liked to see more of the creature to add terror impact.  Abrams' script and direction capture the period nicely.  However, the movie confuses us as to whether the alien is to be feared or sympathized with.  After all, Alice states \\"It's just hungry and wants to go home.\\"---the same creature who has been wiping out the town's citizens and dogs.  And is the strange device that moves around in Joe's room alive?<br />SUPER 8 is certainly enjoyable but may frighten younger children.  Adults may enjoy its nostalgia and gentle depiction of friendship and love.
B004LP15LI|5.0|Much like those astronauts who walked on the Moon - \\"what comes next in life?\\" - it's arguable that everything that Karajan undertook after this miraculous 1955 recording was an afterglow, his celestial Bruckner notwithstanding. It is the most translucent Cosi Fan Tutte in existence. It is flawlessly sung and characterised - and how well do the soloists listen to one another! The fact that it is in mono does not even register, such be the wizardry of Walter Legge.<br /><br />Do not deprive yourself of this wonder. Take this ticket to Cythera.

B002XUBDZ6|4.0|[[ASIN:B002XUBDZ6 The Running Man [Blu-ray]]] played exactly as advertised.  This is a crisp HD transfer of one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1980s action films.<br /><br />The Running Man is a story of a society run amok with power - a simplified Orwellian nightmare on a b-movie scale, one with fascist controls over the population, plenty of propaganda, fabrication and manipulation of news, and a #1 TV show where convicts are publicly forced to combat gladiators for a chance at freedom.<br /><br />Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards, a former government agent turned convict who ends up on \\"The Running Man,\\" TV show, fighting for his life against his would-be executioners.  The acting is clearly b-movie grade, but beyond watching Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime, the secondary highlight is watching Richard Dawson play Killian, the host of the show.  Dawson lends his experience from over 25 years of game shows and talk shows to provide a slightly darker side of himself, a character that has no problem with making sport of man's life.<br /><br />The film itself is presented in 7.1 DTS-HD, and this blu-ray version looks and sounds better than anything I've ever previously experienced.  Included in audio options are 2 different commentaries.  One features director Paul Michael Glaser and producer Tim Zinnemann.  The other is by the film's executive producer, Rob Cohen.<br /><br />In the Special Features section, this blu-ray contains the theatrical trailer and 2 documentaries.<br /><br />One is a documentary short titled \\"Lockdown on Main Street: Civil Liberties Post 9/11.\\"  It's a somewhat biased look at the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.  The documentary is concerned with just how far the US government could go with PATRIOT, based on the loose scope and resulting broad power contained within that law.<br /><br />The other documentary is \\"Game Theory: An Examination of Reality TV.\\"  This documentary examines the intricacies of reality television and how the shows manipulate thereality they purport to portray.  It also addresses the growing amount of surveillance cameras in daily life, and in a slightly-biased point of view, they play up the concern for peoples' liberty associated with these new potential intrusions.<br /><br />Comparatively, this is a no-frills blu-ray release.  The audio commentaries are nice, but the special features section is sparse when stacked up against your average popular film's blu-ray release.  There are no deleted scenes, nor is there a still gallery with lobby cards and other memorabilia.  2 mediocre documentaries and a theatrical trailer is all you get for extras.<br /><br />Anyone who is a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger films, however, should be completely satisfied with this product.

B005SV9W4Q|5.0|As a Little Monster, I love Lady Gaga and am willing to collecting as much Gaga merchandise as I can.  Also, I am a sucker for remix albums and tend to collect the remixes and remix albums of my favorite artists.  \\"Born This Way: The Remix\\" is a fairly good remix album.  It didn't blow me away like I expected, but I believe the main culprit in that was my high expectations.  To get myself pumped for the release, I listen to the \\"Born This Way\\" album many times, and I love that album so much.  The bar was pretty high.  Plus, the remix albums I love from Britney Spears and Puffy AmiYumi made the bar higher still.  So when I listened to this remix album, I was ready to get knocked back out of my sandals and see stars for the next two hours.  Unfortunately, it didn't happen quite like that.  However, I was pleased.  One thing this album did with its songs was make me feel feelings of nostalgia.  There are a lot of good dance tunes that are sure to get you to move and will give a kick-start to any workout.  They also really help my imagination get going and no doubt will help me when I write.  These songs are given a unique twist from the eerie vibe of the Goldfrapp remix of \\"Judas\\" to the spy-thriller remix of \\"Scheiße\\".  I do recommend this album to any Little Monster.

But still, I recommend it because I am obviously in a minority!

0307891402|2.0|I buy and use the game guides for most games I purchase, particularly RPGs.  I like to have the reference available without opening the computer while I'm at the PS3.  The rave reviews this guide is receiving are not deserved.  No doubt Prima put a lot of time into the guide, and there is detailed information available here, but frankly that is the minimum expected for an Elder Scrolls game.  The Brady game guide for Oblivion was better laid out and easier to read.  (Just to be clear, I did not love that guide either.)  The small print in this guide is an issue.  There are mistakes in the guide; other reviews have mentioned the typos but there are also outright errors (such as in the alchemy tables).  The biggest problem is the huge amount of spoilers.  There is NO reason for a game that revolves around the world story to have such extensive spoilers in the guide.  Piggyback has done a fantastic job making minimal spoiler guides that include all the great reference material one could hope for with Assassin's Creed II and Brotherhood (I have not looked at the Revelations guide yet).  It is a trend I hope to see take hold in the game industry, but no such luck with the Skyrim guide.  There have been moments in Skyrim when I just wanted enough information about a particular NPC (such as if I should reload after my spectacular dragon fight randomly kills an NPC), and upon looking that NPC up in the guide had a major quest point spoiled right up front.  I say these things recognizing that it is difficult to write a guide for an open world RPG spoiler free.  I would not mind so much if I thought that Prima cared about such things.  I have the strong impression that they do not.  Here's hoping Bethesda finds someone who does for the next Elder Scrolls guide.  Edited to add:  I see now that the Oblivion guide was also a Prima guide; could have sworn it was Brady games.  That said, now it's really unclear to me why the formatting is so different for the Skyrim guide.  They would have been better off staying with the less confusing layout.  Also, the guide I have is the collector's edition, but I have not had a chance to compare it to the regular guide.  If there are features outside of the interactive online map that are different for the collector's edition and worthy of comment, I will update later.

1597801585|4.0|Very exciting and original novel. Pacing was great. It starts out slow for the first hundred or so pages, but then it starts to accellerate and the narrative momentum just builds and builds.  The cast of characters was slightly one-dimensional, but each managed to be interesting in some way. The most memorable for me was poor Hock Seng, who seemed perpetually tormented by a safe future just out of reach. Anderson was also intriguing. His story arc was almost literary in the way he manages to outwit his numerous enemies while still putting the noose around his own neck.  Downsides were that toward the end there are an amazing number of plot turns. Each is well foreshadowed but eventually you start to expect that every plot resolution will be undone within the next 2 pages. At the end of the novel, nothing is really resolved and the fates of almost every character remain open. Yet the ending is still satisfying. Sequel please!  The underlying theme touches on the nature of humanity and what it means to be \\"real.\\" The novel doesn't really add anything new or insightful to this discussion, but it does integrate the topic very well into the storyline, managing to avoid being overbearing.  Great read.

B005HSG3TC|2.0|The case is solid, offers protection and is very light. I really wanted to like this case, I've used it for about a week now and functionally it works as promised. The problem is that that bottom of the case is very hard and sharp and when holding the Fire by the bottom (the way I typically do for reading) it pokes into my skin and just feels uncomfortable. I am returning the case today and will be looking for a better option (maybe leather, like my Kindle 3 case).
B001OSIV62|5.0|After seeing so many films of the trade centers collapsing, I found this very interesting to see the building of these towers along with the master plan to string a wire between them for a walk. You see how Phillipe walked between the Notre Dame Cathedral towers, his practicing in a field and his master plan to attempt what seems impossible. You meet the others who helping in the planning and execution of this feat. Some of this is French with English subtitles so be sure your screen is big enough to read them when they come up. Fascinating, riveting and keeps you interested. I am very glad I watched this film.<br /><br />This guy did what nobody in the world has ever done!
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This is a nice lightweight case for the Kindle Fire. I got it in pink and it is a nice shade of pink. There is nothing fancy about this case, just provides protection for KF and a stand when you want one.   If you are just holding it in hand, you can flip the cover portion completely to back and hold in place with elastic band. That way you can hold KF in portrait or landscape mode.

B005V20JKI|1.0|It just was not entertaining for an adult. 5 year old...perfect! I had to figure out on my own how to play cause there were no directions. Hate learning as you go &amp; you don't know what you did to advance.
159420229X|4.0|This would not have been a book I would have picked up to read. Having met Ed Cooke, and witnessed first hand him recounting 75 numbers, there was no question in my mind. Very good read. I liked the story, backround info and general narative of this book. I would pick it up if you would like to improve your memory now, if your over 50...get it.
B001NERPHS|3.0|This is not totally Bob Dylan.  However, that's OK because (future)The Band does a great job.  The recording quality is clearly not \\"studio,\\" but that kinda adds to the charm.  Sadly, disc 1 is defective, so I'll return it for an exchange.
1577311523|1.0|tolle uses the power of now to brag about how he invented/discovered present-time awareness and has reached enlightenment faster than the buddha himself. after 1/3 of his book, i am unconvinced that tolle will be able to free me from pain and suffering. i will take refuge in the three jewels, four noble truths, and eight fold path, while continuing my mediation practice... thank you very much... instead of listening to this park bench prophet for profit.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is exactly what I'm looking for my children. It's also great for adults. The app is very responsive and fun.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie quite alot because it has action, it's funny and has a little romance too. This is the 1st movie I have seen with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp together and I enjoyed the easy way they interacted with each other in this movie. They were a perfect fit for the stars.
B0058RCVYS|5.0|This movie is quite a gem. Not the usual American fare, very refreshing and well told story. I gave it five stars because I couldn't give it six!
B00004RFFI|5.0|Item as described. The price was right for one of my favorite movies.  Arrived in a timely manner. Thanks for a friendly transaction!
B005DMNS4A|1.0|All I can say is that for all the other new remasters, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, etc., the original tapes seem to have been just fine to do the remasters.  If the original tapes for the vinyl weren't good enough for John Astley (who isn't Pete Townsend who did announce the originals would be used), why didn't he use the Half-Speed Master Gold Disc and polish that up.  I'm willing to bet that would have been \\"sonically acceptable\\" as well as true to the LP version, which obviously the overwhelming majority prefers.  I am also glad I did not buy the ridiculously more expensive box set.  That's a lame excuse to sell an inferior product, Mr. Astley.  The LP must have been 'good enough' to be as treasured by fans of truly great music, so use the best available \\"sonically acceptable\\" version.  I'm sure Pete has a spare copy or two of the Gold Disc he'd have let your borrow.  Quadrophenia is one of my all-time favorites and the 1996 re-mix is sad and this is even sadder.  Thank goodness my original CDs are still in fine shape and I can hear the real deal vs. a pale impression of the original.  Shame on you Mr. Astley, and you too Pete.  If it was truly great back way then, it's still truly great.  You've lost my trust.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love this game! It works awesome on my new Kindle fire. Love the graphics. sooooo addicting! It's. hard to put down.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I love this application! The widget is very customizable and there are no such things as too much information (especially when you need to see details on bad weather). My phone came with Accuweather pre-installed, but information download on it was very slow and to see more detailed information and maps you need to go to internet page. With this application you can see forecast downloaded to your phone. This application is worth of your money!
0439023521|4.0|Pretty much an American remake of Japanese book \\"Battle Royale.\\" Is interesting and engaging in its own way, but cannot outshine the visions of brutality and humanity of its predecessor.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|If you have never heard musical theatre, this particular CD will entice you. The voices of the two primary characters, Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Borgess are outstanding. I cannot wait to hear the Phantom of the Opero 25th anniversary CD and see the DVD...
B004LROMSO|5.0|this was an excellent production of a much loved saga.  the actors were terrific and each episode was exciting and full of interest.
1439192812|5.0|This is a very intuitive book which explains how things came to be, at about a middle school level.  In other word, it is not so verbose and technical as most Dawkins books. That is the great thing about this book, in that more people will keep reading and not get turned off by technical details in the other books by this author.  That said, the reader still needs to think about the concepts in the bookwhich are so well-presented.  This book should help to dispel some of the myth and superstition which keeps circulating in our society.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|....And turned this off after 20 minutes. But I didn't. I watched the complete movie, hoping it would come together and make sense. It never did. This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a while. I really like Sean Penn and Brad Pitt, but this movie is disappointing.  Turn on the Discovery Planet Earth series. Turn on some loud opera/piano music. Have someone stand behind you as you watch/listen and whisper things in your ear like, \\"Are you watching me?\\" or \\"I wanted to believe you were there.\\" Then turn on two minutes of Jurassic Park with some dinosaur footage.  That sums up the movie. Awful.
159420229X|5.0|When I picked up this book in the \\"New Books\\" section of the local library, I had rather low expectations for its content. So, I was surprised to find an entertaining, well-written and well-researched book on human memory. I suspect that practically any armchair philosopher or cognitive scientist would find this a good read. Enjoy!
1933633867|5.0|Well written and engaging.<br /><br />My executive summary:<br /><br />Until recently, we had economies working on credit, not currencies. Currencies only become popular under militaristic empires. When these empires collapse together with their gigantic armies, we go back to a credit system. Credit systems are decentralized and support trust-based trading. Currencies are the basis for what we call \\"markets\\" today, that is, anonymous state-supported trade systems. The move to a fiat currency in the 1970s, according to Graeber, is actually a natural evolution... it is a prelude to the collapse of the currencies and of the American military empire. If you follow his model, we are headed straight for a decentralized credit-based system with small armies, modest governments.
B005J4TLQG|4.0|When I first saw this trailer I was on the fence about watching it, now I am glad I did! Its a nice lil action flick that keeps ya entertained. I will buy this movie!
B003UMW68Y|5.0|We bought this movie to have a nice Fall celebration day, carve pumpkins, have cider and popcorn, and watch a movie.  My 3-year old loves this movie so much that we have seen it pretty much every other day since the middle of October!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Moore is funny, intensely smart, and presents the truth he has discovered in a way every American can understand. The truth he has dug up for this Documentary is an eye-opener.
1451648537|3.0|I read the book immediately upon release and while it was enjoyable in the end I have to conclude that the definitive Jobs biography has not yet been written. This book is likely best considered as source material for whomever will eventually write the definitive work. While the author obviously had great access to Jobs in the creation of this book it is not clear that he was capable of using this to obtain great insight into the man. What you will learn from this book is that Jobs was indeed as rude, crude, and mean as you undoubtedly already knew (more so, actually) but what you will not learn is why he was this way. Most disappointedly, you will not learn why we consider him to be a great man and to have accomplished great things and will be left wondering only why.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I had a very hard time getting through the first few chapters of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Once I got into the story, I couldn't put it down, but I felt that there was not enough action in the early chapters to make me want to read more.  I would not have read it except that a friend loaned it to me and then asked what I thought about it.<br />I loved the character of Lisbeth.  I appreciated her eccentricity and the way she was confident about herself in spite of her oddities.  People often feel such a need to conform to others' standards -- it was nice to see an oddball character who could embrace her own uniqueness.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|Definitely worth the rental... I always enjoy these nostalgia adventures, and it seems their appeal continues to hold strong.  Director Abrams understands the power of heightened adolescent experience and Super 8 will be added to the likes of Stand By Me, It, Dreamcatcher, ET, Goonies, The Explorers, and so on.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|This album is absolutely BRILLIANT!!!! I hope their new album is as good. Well done Chad and group.I love NickelBack they are the best thing to come out of Canada in a long time. I hope they come to Perth W/A soon
0061854549|3.0|In this book Dan discusses intersting and very applicable aspects of human decision making process and provides the examples of experiences to support his points.

0307001466|5.0|This book is a timeless classic, gorgeously illustrated by the amazing Mary Blair. When I ordered the book from a used book seller I was hoping that I would get one of the copies printed in the 60s or 70s (because I wanted to see it with the original graphic design and without the \\"Classic Golden Book\\" stuff written on the front and back covers), but alas it was a used copy of the new reprint. Oh well! It's still a beautiful book!

1451627289|5.0|Wow.  This is the kind of King story I love because George/Jake and Sadie will remain with me even though the story has ended.  I've heard complaints about the ending but I left completely satisfied, maybe even more so than most of Kings books.  I can't help but compare this to 'Bag Of Bones' the story telling is very similar and I have to believe that if you love one you'll love the other.    My only complaint is that I finished this one night earlier than I'd planned-- I just couldn't stop!
B004EPZ0BQ|5.0|The chemistry between those two is so fun to watch! How come a signer is a so good actor! And the girl is funny and vivacious!
0345529057|5.0|Like many others, I was first introduced to the Game of Thrones series by the HBO miniseries aired in summer 2011. I loved the series and decided to the purchase the books. I was disappointed to find out how expensive they were on the Kindle, so I purchased this box set, which was much cheaper. So far, I've only finished the first two books, but they are both excellent. I couldn't put them down. I can't wait to read the next two.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|If you want to watch a good movie, this one is not for you. But I love to watch Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake play and sometime a good simple laugh is most welcome! In a movie library you need to possess films that one to forget that life can be difficult and complicated! And I don't think that I would like my kids and real teachers to watch it! She is a real bad teacher!
B005P78VK4|5.0|\\"Immortal\\" is immaculate!    As in FINALLY after all of these decades a deserving remix l.p. (of sorts; to be exact a hybrid compilation of remixes and mash-ups) has been done for Michael Jackson's adult solo recordings!  (It does include songs by both The Jackson 5 and The Jacksons which have been selected and done very well too.)  This is MINDBLOWINGLY WELL DONE!  Like the critics in the media said this is the first time that this has ever been done for Michael Jackson in terms of a remix l.p.    \\"Blood On The Dance Floor - HIStory In The Mix\\" was released mid 1997 (the first and only Michael Jackson remix l.p. of any adult solo recordings up to this release) and became the world's best selling remix album (with four million copies sold worldwide at the time of promotion) which remains as so to this day.  (Current sales shortly before he died were at eight million copies sold worldwide.)  The cover on it was amongst M.J.'s best and \\"Is It Scary\\" was one of the five new tracks on it and one of his best ever.  (The cover for \\"Immortal\\" is outstanding as well!  As well as the artwork, photographs, and liner notes inside and out.)  The other four songs were good (on \\"B.O.T.D.F.\\") too but the eight remixes on it were horrible.  Honestly from what I can tell remixes in general with popular music tended to be horrible until the late 1990's often using generic terrible repetetive drum playing from beginning to end of the song.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE!  FINALLY Michael Jackson has receieved the treatment he deserves!  This thing is SO EXCITING!!!    From what I can tell at this time Michael only had SOME good remixes on his single releases in the 1990's onwards.  At that point many in America had stopped listening to him.  MTV and the media (e.g.: CNN) like a boa around his neck had started to squeeze the life out of him by demonizing him to no end so many people have not heard good remixes by Michael at this point in any way.  (Especially here in the U.S. of A.)  To clarify what this is it is a hybrid compilation of remixes and mash-ups.  (And the studio soundtrack to the show of the same name.)  It is done very well for a first type of release for Michael Jackson like this including the selection of songs to the creativity using all of the sounds (and songs) sampled from the world of Michael Jackson brought to life like never before!!!  Remember Michael Jackson was not just a singer, songwriter, producer, actor, and live entertainer!  He was a recording artist and as so examples of this are evident throughout this release in both music and testiment by the man himself!  This release has every right to outsell worldwide sales of \\"Blood On The Dance Floor - HIStory In The Mix\\" and become the world's new best selling remix album!    Get this NOW!!!    \\"Immortal\\" is immaculate!  P.S.: Just to clarify for those saying this is not something M.J. would authorize I would say that we have no idea and I feel VERY confident he would have.  He allowed (as far as I know at this point) remixes on his singles.  I would imagine that the idea of a remix album not happening like this at this point was for strategic commercial reasons...which is fine.  If anything from what I understand it was the remixes on \\"Blood On The Dance Floor - HIStory In The Mix\\" that he did not want released.  Supposedly he came up with his own remixes but Sony did not want those released which was the beginning of when they started to sabatoge him creatively, artistically, commercially, and personally.

1451627289|1.0|every other word is right-wing this, right-wing that. It gets really boring after a while, Stephen. King is extremely left-wing so of course he paints everyone on the right as a nut.  King also has the gaul to create a fictional universe and say that Republicans filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 64! In reality, the LARGE majority of Republicans supported it. The Democrats barely managed to get half of the House and Senate to support it. The bill was filibustered though, that really did happen. It was done by racist Democrats, not Republicans. Mr. King wants so badly to whitewash history that he needed to delve into fantasy land to make himself feel better about his beloved Democratic Party.  JFK's assassin was a far-left communist, yet King makes Conservatives out to be the villains.

0670022705|3.0|Books like this one help the reader to reflect on how we reconstruct history from objects that come down to us from the past.  Inevitably, historical objects are interpreted in the context of our times and cultural narratives.  Sometimes the historian sees what he wants to see and makes an object fit into a preconceived narrative of the past.<br /><br />Some of the objects described in this book seem to me to have been over-interpreted in this way.  This can be a danger when trying to understand historical objects from indigenous peoples now trying to assert their identity and place in history.<br /><br />Occasionally, one favoured interpretation is presented as the likely truth, whereas there are a number of other equally plausible explanations.  The fact is that we often have no way of knowing what the truth is - if, indeed, there is only one truth.<br /><br />This is however a minor blemish on an excellent book.  In fact it may not even be a blemish at all, in that it causes the reader to think about broader matters of historiography.

The music has aged well, but you can file this under \\"Great albums with absolutely horrific lyrics.\\"  Even songs I thought were profound years ago, like \\"Through Her Eyes,\\" make me cringe now.
B005IZLPMY|1.0|We rented this for a dollar.  What a terrible movie, acting and story.  I think they are beating a dead horse with the wave of  movies geared towards past comic book heros.  Save yourself some money, wait until this is on HBO if you still want to watch it.  Horrible movie.
B0013FBS20|4.0|I am Legend could have been a great movie. The setting, the actor, and the story generally make it all possible. Unfortunately, it starts off wonderfully, but slowly loses steam. There is no clear wrap up at the end, leaving viewers to wonder as to the fate of mankind. Also, I found the CGI on the \\"psycho people\\" to be distracting. They don't move like humans, and that makes them seem less threatening... distended jaws, leaps that defy gravity, etc. It wasn't necessary. Will Smith is very good in it, although it is unclear how the world was lucky enough to have the lone expert in the virus immune to it. Some explanation should have been offered. Overall, a good movie.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Absolutely stunning performance from Jeff Beck and the entire band which is absolutely awesome.  Incredibly tight and energetic.  Great video.

B00005JPD0|5.0|I honestly don't remember enjoying this movie very much the first time I watched it -- I think I was too young and wasn't able to follow it well enough. After watching it again recently however, I can now say that it's one of my favorite movies. Denzel Washington is an extremely skilled actor and that along with a gripping and unique storyline makes for a really great movie. Jim Caviezel does an amazing job as the villain, a role very different from anything I've ever seen him in.   If you've got a good imagination and you're ready to have your mind blown, this movie is for you!
B004RFYEEC|5.0|To semi quote the late Dennis Wilson there. Now I could go into this long winded review about why SMiLE is a five star classic, quite frankly I do not have the credentials to do that. I was not around in 1967 when it was abandoned, nor did I collect bootlegs back in the day. In fact, my introduction to SMiLE was Brian Wilson's solo version which he did with his touring band back in 2004. I bought that version on a whim and loved it. Only problem is it wasn't The Beach Boys on it. Believe me this makes a world of difference. I seem to be getting ahead of myself here. I will finish my short review by saying this. The SMiLE Sessions lives up to the immense hype and then some. Everything from the packaging to the sound quality, to the songs it contains are absolutely stunning. The fact that it surpasses the hype makes it even more special. Just check out some of the other reviews on here. There have been people who have waited 45 years for this to come out. I can not think of anything in music that comes close to the magnitude of this release.  This is a true work of art, deserving of all the praise it gets

B005V20JKI|4.0|I keep coming back to it because it's just so addictive. I dislike raging every time I have an unfair death, yet I keep playing!<br /><br />Now, some improvements: make us able to choose perks. Also, fix description of the perks. Tell us that we can't jump on angry enemies. Tell us that slow down time sucks (rather, don't tell us they're sitting ducks when they're still fast).<br /><br />Overall, fun game, but could use some minor tweaks. A fun addition would be being able to pick up smart bombs, and clearing the screen in a jiffy. Yes that makes Mr Rainbow redundant, but it's a lot better than accidentally firing his rainbow and being defenseless (and also not being able to jump on enemies because they're angry)<br /><br />On that note as well, keeping the tiered perks would be fine as long as we can use all the ones we've unlocked. Otherwise it makes no sense for it to be tiered. If we could choose which perk we want then using only one perk would make sense, but it doesn't make sense that we have to essentially waste points.

B0055OK2T0|3.0|First Impressions:  The movie was not bad, but did not resonate with me at all.  David Norris is a politician on his way up.  But on the night of the election he is losing badly due to an unflattering photo appearing in the New York Post (yeah, it happens).  He meets a girl in the mens' room who is running from security as she crashed a wedding (how, why or when is never explained).<br /><br />After a five minute conversation they kiss passionately right there in the mens' room.  Yeah, like that would happen, but it's Hollywood.<br /><br />There is an organization which runs behind the lines controlling Man to some ultimate destiny.  It was explained that when Man was not guided, the Dark Ages and being on the brink of nuclear destruction with the Cuban Missile Crisis followed.<br /><br />Despite these clear explanations, David Norris still wants the girl even though it would ruin his career and hers.  He abandons her at first and then changes his mind.  He wears his magic hat and runs through doors which act as portals to different areas of the city.  We get to see a freaked-out girl and the sewers of New York, both of which are not pretty to see.<br /><br />Ending:  No spoiler, but I was not impressed.  The ending was predictable.  I would have preferred Norris making president and looking back at that and chuckle, or God having the last laugh.  Rental!
1451627289|5.0|The Kennedy assassination has always fascinated me.  For me, as a kid, it was a time of great fun as well as fear, with that ever present reminder of danger with the presence of a nuclear attack siren outside my apartment window.  I will never forget that fateful day being told over the loudspeaker that classes were canceled and we were all to go home.  Even as an 11 year old, I felt like my world was coming apart.    I have always loved to read all the books written as well as all the conspiracy theories as one could never fathom that Oswald could have done this.  By no means do I support any conspiracy and in fact, from my perch, there is no doubt that Oswald, given the ineptitude of the Secret Service and Dallas Police as well as just having this nut in the right place at the right time allowed the stars to align for his fateful act to be committed.  With that prelude, I always wondered myself, if something just something interfered with this chance encounter, what would have been.  I think King does an incredible job intertwining the \\"butterfly effect\\", time travel and unintended consequences into a fascinating novel exploring these topics.  I couldn't put the book down.    While King may to some have gone overboard in character development, there was a method to his madness. Not only was he setting up \\"future\\" encounters in following chapters but what seemed to be a waste of the written word, actually had the strange effect of keeping me engaged in order to force me to the next chapter that always had a twist wanting me to continue to read even further.    These are just the kind of books I love.    From my perspective, there was only one aspect of the book that could and should have been left out.  How the \\"butterfly effect\\" of time travel effected physical factors of our world made no sense and eliminating this would have led to a much more effective and \\"believable\\" ending.  Otherwise a great book about and great topic.

B000W91RUG|5.0|When this show first came out, I paid only casual attention to it.  I wasn't hooked until I saw the episode in which Sheldon and Leslie Winkle (Leonard's girlfriend at the moment) engage in an argument over the relative merits of String Theory and Quantum Gravity.  I had been involved in a discussion with one of my fellow scientists regarding this very same topic only days before viewing this episode--and the points that we addressed were almost the same as those articulated by the characters.  I had never seen a TV show where the characters actually talked about the same things that we real scientists do--and actually in an intelligent manner!  That said, not all statements voiced by the characters regarding physics are sensible or realistic.<br /><br />Of course, this is a TV comedy--not a documentary!  Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and the rest of the crew, Physicists and other Ph.D.-bearing scientists and engineers who reside in the real world have little interest in comic books and superheroes.  In fact, of the thousands of scientists who I have known, only one ever expressed a great interest in comic books or superheroes.  Although people with such graduate degrees have generally seen movies and TV shows featuring such staples as Star Trek, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings, I am not sure that they view them more often than the general public.  Most scientists I know are more interested in the sports teams of their hometowns, music (both popular and classical), politics, and literature.  It is probably true, however, that scientists read more science fiction novels than the general public.<br /><br />Like Leonard, most scientists would indeed count themselves lucky to have a charming girlfriend like his lovely neighbor Penny played by Kaley Cuoco--and her often insightful character provides an important counterpoint to the book-smart but socially awkward scientists across the hall.  Her character is also admirable for her many clever and humorous remarks.  She is even able to eventually appreciate the somewhat obscure in-jokes of her scientist neighbors!  I should also observe that some scientists and engineers do have to ability to surround themselves with attractive women--and it is such smooth operators who become department heads at universities or government research labs!<br /><br />It has also come to my attention that this TV show was nearly the biggest topic of conversation for physicists attending the 2012 March Meeting of the American Physical Society!  Apparently many of the attendees had all of the episodes memorized, and spent much of their time at the APS meeting debating the significance and theme of each episode!en able to eventually appreciate the somewhat obscure in-jokes of her scientist neighbors!

B000JQUMPI|5.0|I loved this book.  I found a lot of life lessons in it.  I had such an easy time reading it on my Kindle, especially during my sleepless nights before having my baby.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|The Lion King has always been one of my favorite animated movies of all time, and the Diamond Edition just shows how far we have come with respect to remastering older movies. The outlines of the characters are more sharper than ever, and the sound is amazing! I only wish I had a 3D TV so I can watch the blu-ray 3D edition of it.
0307891372|4.0|A work of art doesn't need to have a mandatory relation with function, or at least, with functionality. But we're not talking about art here, this is a game guide, and a product such as this one needs to address function, since its main goal is to enhance the full enjoyment of another product: a game. That being said, taste, with all its subjective variables, still remains a factor as to how good this guide really is. This review won't address taste, or awesomeness, but simply whether the function of this guide is met or not.  The short answer is a resonating yes.  However, bear in mind that this review does not attempt to be an impartial one. This premisse is important, because this guide also made a choice when it comes to handling (and offering) wealth of information, and that is debatable in terms of being a pro (the position of this review) or a con (a position held by other types of players/reviewers, with the same ammount of logic, validity and legitimacy to it). It can only be hoped that sincerity and detailed insights can be achieved together to help you make an informed buying decision.  MAIN PROS:  - Enhances playability to an amazing degree of detail and depth. Every possible Quest (with all of its possibilities), NPCs, Guilds, Skill Books, Lore Books, Dungeons and Random Encounters are present, coupled with detailed maps and multiple ways to cross-reference the info so you can approach it on any way you desire. Playing Skyrim with this guide satiates the neurotic in all of us: you -will- feel complete in terms of exploring every nook-and-cranny the game has to offer. The wealth of 'things-to-do' and 'replay value' are a trademark of The Elder Scroll series, and this guide lives up to the game it describes.  - Enhances the enjoyment of the game, the two go -very- well together. This guide will entice, increase and maintain your appetite to play Skyrim.  MAIN CONS:  - Two cons intrinsically linked (1. The beatiful layout of the guide is a double-edged sword; 2.Fails to organize its wealth of information taking the 'specifics of a game' in mind) producing an undesirable result: it reveals too much with ineffective warnings. The problem is not so much of 'how' the categories are organized - it does a good job in that respect, given the size of the game and the premisse of covering everything it has to offer - but 'how much' is given on each of those categories. Not only that, but the way the prose is written - and the way the many in-game screenshots are arranged - leaves you with a feeling that the guide is competing with the game itself for your attention, and in a bad way. Often times you'll find yourself like a child on a theme park: \\"Ooohhh! Look at that over here! Ohhhh! Look at that over there! Shiny!\\". The problem is that you'll stumble upon information that, on a first playthrough, can severely spoil the experience. It doesn't happen on an excessive level, but sometimes it does things like presenting an essential NPC picture with subtitles for the sake of beauty and layout, when they really shouldn't dispell the veil of mistery around him/her. Even though it places 'Spoiler Tags' all over the guide, the way that it's done (how the info is organized bellow the tags) seems almost cynical, like saying \\"I'm terribly sorry, but I'm gonna be terribly disrespectful towards your family\\".  SECONDARY PROS:  - If you're not on a first playthrough, then this guide will rise to its true greatness, unlocking every little detail you missed. It was an amazing pleasure to have it as a trustworthy companion, revising things I wish I'd done some other way and discovering nuances about themes I've only scratched the surface.  SECONDARY CONS:  - Lacks a section about the console codes. I was surprised to find out that the guide doesn't even mention this. TES games are known for an open, built-in console mode that allows you much more than mere cheating (which, in and of itself, should be included in a trully thorough guide): it'sextremely useful as a workaround for bugs (its main strength) and underised situations (accidental NPC deaths for example). The lack of such a section cripples the amazing quality and standard of this product.  MISCELLANEOUS PROS:  - The material of the pages responds well to pen and pencil and, most important, erasers. Just be sure to have an above-average eraser (no more than US$2,50 a piece), so as not to damage the pages.  - Check-Lists that will help you keep track of progress (something that is increased in its value, due to a poor Quest User Interface of the vanilla version of Skyrim).  - An extremely thorough Index at the end (dungeons, NPCs, quests, unique items, spells, books etc.). On a practical level this is -the- most useful feature. You'll find yourself referencing to it very often, to go directly where the desired information is.  MISCELLANEOUS CONS:  - Lack of detachable Index pages. Another feature surprisingly absent. When in the middle of the game, sometimes the mood is broken by having to flip back to Index in order to find what you want then flipping all the way to the desired page. In -a lot- of situations you'll also want to find two pieces of information at the same time, described in different sections, making it even more of a pain to do it. Additional detachable Index pages would facilitate the issue tremendously, and this is something already present in other mainstream guides (even Prima ones). Precisely because of its size, the lack of this feature is sorely missed.  CONCLUSION  This is a worthy purchase, no doubt about that. It receives a glaring 4 star, even though it can't receive 5 from the standpoint of this review. The cons,  when put together, hurt the overall function of the guide to the point of lowering its final performance(as mentioned earlier, function is what really matters as far as this review is concerned).  Oh, and by the way: its cons, ironically enough, mirror the reception of the game itself. Skyrim (along with its guide) stands as a very sucessful and worthy product, even tough - for catering to a much wider, less focused and less hardcore-gamer audience - sometimes leave features behind that are missed by some historical fans.  But, in the end, we love it either way.
0439023513|3.0|*SPOILERS*  Alright, I loved all three books in the series but the third was completely different. I find it ironic that it is geared towards a middle school audience but the themes present in the series go deeper than war and government. While I loved this book, I felt incomplete at the ending. It lead me to read others' comments on the book where I figured it out: flat. The characters I grew to love in the first and second books fall flat and never regain the charm or appeal that they presented in the first two. Peeta, my favorite, goes off the deep end and is never the Peeta I read and loved so much. I agree (SPOILER) that Prim's death was not necessary and at that point I was too emotionally drained to feel any emotional attachment to her. And yes while this is not a book where Katniss directly debates how she must choose between Gale and Peeta, I feel like her choice is ultimately a settlement because she never opens herself up to loving Gale since she cannot figure out if it was his bomb idea that killed her sister. Even at the end where Peeta asks Katniss if she loves him, real or not real, her response is how she \\"tells\\" him real. That word did not sit right with me, the word tell involves no emotional attachment. After all Peeta and her have been through I should have felt happy for them to have finally ended up together, right? But instead, I felt nothing. I cannot stop thinking about the books though and I must say that there will never be another series like them. I enjoyed every minute of reading the trilogy though and entering into Katniss' world.

0142429112|1.0|I loved the book then, I needed to reread it eight months later to lead a discussion for our book club, I purchased the audio CDs for a refresher.  The reader was putting me to sleep with her  voice as Diana, the lead female character, but when she started trying to sound like the tall, virile, male vampire with a terrible English accent (isn't this character French?) and failing altogether, I just ejected the disc.  At least when I read the book I could see and hear the characters in my mind.  Putting this miscast voice and failed accents to them just ruined the whole thing.  I've only  written three or four reviews in my life (and all of those happy ones), but I just felt I had to write one more and caution possible listeners that their $42 would be wasted.  I wish someone had warned me.

The work is full of the wit and adventure that we have come to expect from Rick Riordan, and I can't wait to read the third installment. I drive a long way to and from work, so I purchased the audio CD version, which I would highly recommend. The narrarator is truly skilled and I really enjoyed it.

B0057567P0|1.0|I was anxious to add USB 3.0 capability to my MacBook Pro when I read about this device. However, the description did not say it only improves your speed with certain devices. I have a 3.0 SD Card reader/write and a two 3.0 external hard drives. Both hard drives required a power chord (sold separately). My goal was to help speed up the writes we are doing to many, many SD Cards. This device made no difference. Writing approximately 2 gig to an SD Card using my 2.0 ports was only slightly slower than the 3.0 ports this card gave me (e.g 45 minutes vs. 40 minutes on average). I guess you have to buy Sonnet devices gain the real speed of this express card. Maybe! Very disappointing.

0446547654|2.0|This book was typical Sparks. I only read it because one of my book club members selected it. It did pull on the heart strings but the whole \\"high school only love\\" was a bit on the sappy side. Of course, as is typical of Sparks, characters started dying at the end. The whole heart transplant scene was completely not believable. If you want some sadness with a shot of non-reality, then read away.
067003830X|5.0|This book is worth its weight in gold to me.  The author, Dr. Norman Doidge, is the first person I have ever read to make the connection between Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EMH) and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder (OCD).  He wrote in the chapter on OCD:  \\"Typical obsessions are fears of contracting a terminal illness, being contaminated by germs, being poisoned by chemicals, being threatened by electromagnetic radiation, or even being betrayed by one's own genes.\\"  In the same chapter he outlines a very effective treatment for OCD, developed by Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz of UCLA.      I suffered miserably from MCS for almost a year until I discovered this book.  My MCS started when I suffered a chemical injury to my sense of smell that healed after 3 weeks, but during that time I started worrying whether my sense of smell would ever return.  That worrying was enough to adversely affect my plastic brain (brain plasticity does have a dark side, as Dr. Doidge points out) and  started me \\"tumbling down the rabbit hole\\" of OCD. Within two months, plastics, dyes, inks, detergents, and glues all smelled toxic and I felt they were all poisoning me.  This situation completely ruined my life until recently when I started Dr. Schwartz's treatment to change my plastic brain back toward the way it used to be.  Oh, and did I mention that this book is worth its weight in gold to me?

1451648537|5.0|This is an extremely well written book about a fascinating man.  Steve Jobs was a unique blend of creativity and technology with an inherent sense of what people would want.  Never using any market research, he changed the home computing industry, the music industry, the mobile phone industry, the animated film industry and the publishing industry.  He was arguably the best innovator of his generation, and the author presents him with all his flaws as well as his genius.  The book is a great character study and an enjoyable read for anyone from teenager on.

B0050PYNO4|4.0|Paul is a movie about two English geeks who is visiting USA to go to Comic con and taking a road trip to America's UFO hot spots, soon however to fun little vacation turn rather bizarre as the geeks meet Paul, an escaped alien on the run from the government, the two Englishmen decides to help Paul get to the place where he will be picked up by his mother ship and so start a chaotic and hilarious romp of a movie which spew pop culture references left and right. In a way Paul is very similar to another geeks on the road movie, Fanboys, and as a geek myself I almost laughed myself to death watching this movie.<br /><br />I also have to hand it to the creators of this movie, they manage to take a story where you after a while have allot of different groups involved and create ordered and very entertaining chaos while still keeping the story on track. The characters are great and I found myself caring for them, the actors all do a great job and the music and visuals are just perfect. Paul himself is amazing, the animators did a great job with him and they added personality and soul to this CG character which I would compare in quality to Gollum from the Lord of the Rings movies.<br /><br />One aspect of the movie that some might react negatively to is that it makes rather harsh fun of Baptist Christians, Paul makes fun of other groups as well but then much more light hearted. To me I am fine with this but I just wanted to mention it as this is a aspect of the movie that some might be insulted by.<br /><br />My only real complaint about Paul is that at times the jokes do not work, most of the time the movie is very funny, however at time the fart, sex and butt jokes can become a little bit grating, this cost the movie one star from me, but Paul is still a very good movie, the effects are great, the story is great I think anyone would enjoy this movie and I warmly recommend it. If I was going to summon up Paul briefly it would be ET, if he swore, smoked and had the language of a drunk sailor and the kid where replaced with two grown science fiction enthusiasts and a crazy Baptist woman, if that concept sounds like something you might enjoy then Paul is for you.d where replaced with two grown science fiction enthusiasts and a crazy Baptist woman, if that concept sounds like something you might enjoy then Paul is for you.

B005TTEFRG|3.0|Conan the Barbarian is about sort of the start of Conan's legend. Our hero is born on the battlefield after his mother receives a fatal blow and he is raised by his father. Later when Conan is a young boy an evil warlord and his witch daughter come to his village, everyone but Conan get killed and the whole movie is a quest for revenge. Yes there is a rather flimsy story in there about ancient artifacts and a necromantic mask and even a maiden in distress but plot wise this movie is lacking. I sat watching the entire movie expecting some plot twist, some depth, anything, but no there is nothing there is just fight, fight, fight, kill the bad guy and stop his evil plot, get the girl, ride off into the sunset, and that is all there is. The plot of Conan the Barbarian is sourly missing.<br /><br />Now I do not think this is a bad movie, the visuals are fantastic, the fight scenes are exiting and very creative and the actors all do a good job. Jason Momoa is perfect as Conan, Rachel Nichols do a good job with our main heroine, though the character herself is rather bland, Rose McGowan is ravishing as the evil witch Marique, my favorite character of the whole movie, Stephen Lang manages to get the very stereotypical bad guy Khalar Zym interesting. The supporting cast to do a great job. The music of Conan the Barbarian is forgettable but do frame the movie well.<br /><br />As eye candy this movie work well, it is entertaining, however I wonder a bit where the producer is going with this, even the short stories in the Conan comic books have more depth than this story, none of the characters are more than cardboard cut outs and they never develop during the course of the movie, and then there are the plot holes like how come Tamara who is a monk in a secluded monastery do not bat an eyelash at killing people? I am not saying she have to be innocent, but give some explanation for when I see a cleric in white robes I am not thinking cold blooded murderer, fighting skills yes, sure she can have learned those at the monastery, but why is she so used to killing people?<br /><br />I did enjoy myself when I watched this movie, it is a good popcorn flick but I had hoped for something more, some betrayals, some story twists, anything but oh I am going to kill the man who killed my father, what do you know I found him, let me just plow through his henchmen and then get him. For the entertainment value and the great visuals I give Conan the Barbarian 3 stars, the movie do really capture the look of the books and the comics, but I can not give it more due to the flat storyline no matter how much i really want to like it.<br /><br />I recommend Conan the Barbarian as a mindless action flick, a way to spend two hours if you are bored and just want to stare at a screen and be entertained by swords, magic, guts and boobs, a few good one liners which will make you smile, and a basic revenge plot, if however you want anything more than that then this movie is not for you.earned those at the monastery, but why is she so used to killing people?

B005DMNS4A|5.0|Quadrophenia was in some ways a better rock opera than Tommy.  Less repetitive, but then, revisiting themes is what an opera does.  Plus, there's the idea of the Who turning into Rock Opera Specialist.  Thankfully, that did not happen.  The remastered version of this CD is FANTASTIC!  You can actually hear all the nuances that Townshend put into the opening track: the ping pong effect of the vocals, the sound of the ocean waves, and the masterful playing of the Who.  Things that were lost in translation are suddenly clearer.  That alone is reason enough to pick up this edition.<br /><br />The handful of demos that come with this set show some flashes of completeness in themselves: others show you haw Daltry, Entwhistle and Moon enhanced Pete's original ideas.  And Townshend gives credit.  I've listened to Scoops (volumes 1-3) and I can only take a side on vinyl, or 4-6 songs when you start getting the urge for the Who versions.  All in All, a good outcome.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This Blu-ray DVD set does not disappoint. The quality of the picture is amazing. I didn't know Mr. Spock had so many pock marks on his face :) The enhanced special effects are great, but you can watch the DVD with only the original special effects. The sound is pure 7.1 surround sound and adds great depth to the listening as the Starship Enterprise goes wooshing by! All in all a great purchase providing many hours of great entertainment.

0062011847|5.0|This is Terry Pratchett's latest satirical novel about one of his creation's named Sam Vimes. You don't have to have read any of Pratchett's previous novels about Vimes, but the novel \\"Thud\\" by Terry Pratchett does help understand some things in this book, as well as the other 20+ Discworld novels that Mr. Pratchett's has written.  That being said, for those of us who have been reading Discworld books over the years, this book is a must read as it honestly feels as though Mr. Pratchett is saying good-bye to Vimes in many ways. The novel is simple in its plot, like most murders are, but as always there is more to this novel than initially meets the eye.   You have been reading Pratchett over the years you will like this novel. If you have never read Mr. Pratchett before then you probably won't care about this book until you read the other books.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|A movie as carefully, deliberately, and finely crafted as the rifle George Clooney exquisitely creates during the movie. The film doesn't rush and jump but rather has the courage to hold a shot until it ends, to not bury the soundscape with noise, and to trust the audience to notice detail and make connections. No doubt many will be bored or disconcerted by a movie that doesn't force excitement through choppy editing or indicate appropriate emotional reactions with cliched musical prompts, but for those who can attend to the entertainment before them for and entire hour and three quarters, The American offers depth and tension and beauty.

0307454894|4.0|I think the word I would have to use for this book is shocking. More than once I was shocked reading it and actually gasped at one point. The story starts with a young 15 year old boy being helped by an older lady when he is sick, upon returning to thank her for her help they embark upon a physical relationship. This in itself is quite shocking as she is around twice his age but the relationship is very turbulent and bizarre not counting the age issue.  The book jumps on in years and Michael finds himself once again with Hanna in his life when he least expects it and a huge secret about her past. Does this explain why she was the way she was with him or is there something else she is keeping hidden?  The book is written in very short chapters so makes for a quick read and the writing and story itself is very easy to follow. The end takes a turn that I was not expecting (as it had done at the beginning despite knowing a relationship was on the cards).  The book has riled a few feathers with some readers as they feel the author trys to evoke sympathy for Hanna despite what she has done, some have slated the actual writing and felt the content was poor. I for the most part enjoyed the book and as I said it took a few turns I did not expect, it kept my interest and was for the most part easy reading. I think it is fair to say we have another marmite book, I am on the side of liking it and for me it is a 4/5.
B002ZG98C8|4.0|A heartfelt and entertaining contribution to the immigration debate. Also a freakin' awesome modern Grindhouse-style movie with the budget to make it look good and a bunch of stars pretty obviously enjoying the liberation the material affords them to chew the scenery.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|While this game isn't terrible there isn't much to keep me entertained either.  Try the free version before you purchase it.
B0040QYROA|4.0|A visual masterpiece. Absolutely stunning sets and cinematography. The story is much more comprehensible with the lost footage restored. Still heavy handed with outrageous overacting but, since Lang sought to use minimal intertitles, the film is essentially a pantomime and some overacting is necessary and appropriate. This is especially true for Brigitte Helm who must play two identical and identically clothed characters and make them instantly recognizable as different characters without a voice. She accomplishes by imbuing both of her very strong characters with distinct physical vocabularies. Besides the sets and cinematography, the movie is worth a second viewing to appreciate Helm's performances, intense physicality and the surprising strength and independence of her characters which comes as quite a surprise given what we expect of womens' rolls in films of the Silent Era.
0060245867|5.0|I was quite surprised when this book arrived. The book is like brand new and arrived in a timely manner.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|Good flick. Nice character development, not rushed, reasonably credible, very good performances. The training sequences reference both the original Karate Kid and the sort of training sequences found in classic Hong Kong \\"Kung Fu Flicks\\". Pretty much the only things that bothered me were the aspects of the film obviously geared toward promoting and sanitizing China like:   - The training travelogue to tourist destinations   - The outdoor locations in the city which all looked like they'd just been hosed down and scrubbed   - The lack of a single cigarette (even in the background) in a country where 25% of the population smokes and where smoking was not even prohibited in Elementary Schools until after the movie was released [...]
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Great album! I don't know what's with all the low reviews. I like their current style. Plus it would be boring if artists never changed their style. Why would you expect Coldplay 2011 to be the same as Coldplay 2001?  Anyways I'm glad I didn't let the negative reviews deter me from buying MX and miss out on such beautiful music!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|One of the best American action films in quite a while. The action is fast and gritty. The stunts seldom blow past the limits of near-credibility into the realm of CGI cartoon as so many films do these days. The action careens along at such a clip and the plot is just twisty enough that you can't always see what's coming. Man, I wish Jolie weren't too big a name and too expensive to have joined the Avengers ensemble as Black Widow. She would have been spot-on perfect.
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|I was somewhat underwhelmed by \\"Moneyball\\".  Perhaps my expectations were simply too high.  The film is based on a book by Michael Lewis.  I had previously read \\"Liar's Poker\\" and thought it to be a great piece of modern literature.  The film also had a top quality cast including Brad Pitt in the lead role.  What could have gone wrong?  I'm not really sure but the whole package didn't gel.<br /><br />In brief, \\"Moneyball\\" covers a season in the life of the Oakland A's, an American major league baseball team.  The franchise is not rich as it is based in a comparatively small and not particularly wealthy region.  In fact, the team has only a third to spend in comparison with the New York Yankees.  On this basis alone, the team will always lose in the long run.<br /><br />However, within this difficult environment, the viewer is introduced to Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is the manager of the team.  Billy understands his situation and knows he cannot compete on the basis of money alone.  He has to be creative.  He is assisted in this task by the chance discovery of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who is a nerdy baseball statistics geek.  It is Peter who convinces Billy to look deeper into the numbers to locate unwanted and, therefore, cheap, playing talent.<br /><br />Although the film is based on a true baseball story, it fails to please.  Something is missing.  To baseball aficionados, my word may seem sacrilegious.  However, the fact remains that the film is based on a weak thread and the quality of the cast is unable to overcome this handicap.
B00275EHJG|5.0|A magnificent conclusion! Exciting, romantic, funny, touching, wise. Pretty much everything a movie can be. Bring tissues. Seriously. You can skip the 3D, though. Doesn't really add anything.
B005WTR4ZI|1.0|The authors are oblivious to the actual causes of the current global economic mega-bust, which is a different subject altogether (fiat money, central banking, Austrian Business Cycle Theory).   Technology and innovation have always existed, their rate of advancement has always been faster than before, and they have always IMPROVED the human condition by increasing productivity -- which is why today's \\"poor\\" can enjoy luxuries (plumbing, TV, fridge, AC, etc.) that not even kings from 200 years ago could imagine. There is absolutely nothing different about today's technological advancements compared to the ones in the past.   If \\"jobs\\" were the ultimate human end, then let's outlaw the usage of trains and trucks, and force everyone to pay the unemployed to carry cargo from NY to Chicago on foot. Unemployment problem solved, no?  Can \\"we\\", please, bury the Luddite fallacy once and for all? Can \\"we\\" please stop burying ourselves ever deeper by using policy/government \\"solutions\\" to solve problems that are, without exception, created by similarly misguided such \\"solutions\\" from the past? Can \\"we\\", please, leave the market (mutually beneficial, voluntary exchange) well enough alone to make us ALL infinitely more rich and productive than busybody bureaucrats (and their enablers such as the authors of books like these) could ever do? Can \\"we\\" please stop forcing \\"ourselves\\" into doing things \\"we\\" MUST do for \\"our own good\\"?
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Astonishingly good film. A mystery/odyssey which looks uncompromisingly yet respectfully at a subculture filled with despair and danger where even the closest relationships involve caution and suspicion with great care taken to never give up an advantage or reveal anything which could ever possibly be used against you. One of the most genuinely human films I have seen.
0345410025|5.0|Worthwhile to help overcome the loss of memory that comes with aging in most of us. Compact but detailed enough.
B002ZG999U|2.0|Disappointingly lackluster. It has it's moments; a few good action details (most nearly lost in editing), Mickey Rourke stays out of the action and gets to show his acting chops a little, Jason Statham gets the spotlight for a moment in probably the best action sequence in the movie along with a little bit of a character to work with. The other actors get nothin'. And the action is sapped of energy by sloppy quick cut editing. Jet Li, who can sustain an extended fight sequence without cuts gets the same poor close-in quick-cut treatment as the least competent fighter. It's like auto-tuning a singer with perfect pitch - just let the guy do what he's good at and let us see it. The mission which concludes the film is ill-defined and poorly executed. It has no geography. People and obstacles appear and disappear as needed as if by magic. In a good action film we know why people are risking their lives and we know where they are risking their lives. Tension and investment come from knowing what the obstacles are and what our heroes have to work with and a set up where we know success is a long-shot. Here we come to understand that reinforcements can jump out of the wood work (or stonework) so there's no perceived risk.
B005V20JKI|5.0|So fun and addicting, works great on Motorola ATRIX 4G! Can't wait for future updates.. seriously got hooked after the first play
B0041T52S6|4.0|A pop-culture smoothie blending old school video games, live action anime, and mumblecore cinema with a squeeze of the 60s [[ASIN:B000N54NGO Batman]] TV show. The proportions are just right to deliver a tasty treat. Michael Cera's stock Michael Cera character plugs perfectly into the story. I know he's making bank playing this character but, good god, I'd like to see him do something different. Even Schwarzenegger shows more range than this.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|A must see and/or own. Great movie that has been based on true events. Denzel and Chris do a very good job in this movie.
B000055Y0X|4.0|This is a case where the parts are greater than the whole. Taken altogether, Dr. Strangelove is a good movie that doesn't quite seem to come together. The parts, though; the distinct segments that make up the movie; the masterful cinematography that captures the characters and sets in ways that beautifully heighten their essences; the sexual underpinnings of the most powerful character motivations; the all around great performances including Peter Sellers' triple roles and, most impressive of all, George C. Scott's Buck Turgidson which is so animated, so expressive, and so thoroughly committed that, while it hovers just shy of Sellers' delightfully cartoonish Dr. Strangelove, it remains completely believable. These are what make the film a must see for anyone who loves comedy or good filmmaking, or great acting.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I expected more drama, resolution, not to mention DRAGONS, after spending a long time reading (and enjoying) the first four volumes.  Yes, Good Guys die unexpectedly, Bad Guys turn out to be decent, no one gets ahead for being Good or Bad, etc., and in the long run, the book ends with no message except the randomness of life.  Disappointing book and one that leaves many things open to yet more sequels.
B0045NXMJE|3.0|Quirky, funny, charming with tremendous visual style, but not much substance. It's all whipped topping - but really good whipped topping.
0140058893|4.0|A statue in New Orleans commemorates Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero (or anti-hero) of this novel. The statue is located on the former site of a department store outside which, in the opening pages, Ignatius waits for his mother.  The unfortunate Mrs Reilly is in the store buying generous supplies of cakes for Ignatius' greedy consumption. As he waits, Ignatius searches the passing crowd for \\"signs of bad taste\\". Before long, his gross size and eccentric dress attract the attention of a police patrolman, and after he treats the patrolman to some unrestrained remarks he is almost arrested. He manages to deflect the patrolman's attention to a similarly vociferous elderly man who is obsessed with \\"communiss\\", and in the end it is the man who is hauled off to the police precinct.<br /><br />The statue is fitting because John Kennedy Toole has in this book sculpted a fine memorial to New Orleans and its people as it and they were in the early 1960's. That was when Toole (born 1937) was himself about the same age as Ignatius. In as much as Ignatius is an exaggerated version of Toole as he saw himself (of Irish immigrant stock, educated but not very employable, a single man living with his mother, and with similar casual work experience to Ignatius), the statue can also be seen as a memorial to Toole, who committed suicide before the book was published.<br /><br />All the characters introduced in that first scene, including the police patrolman, are carried right through the book. When the patrolman and the elderly man reach the police precinct, Burma Jones is added to the cast list. Jones is a man of color in every sense of the word, a great spokesman - through Toole - for his race, and key to the developments that ultimately bring about the denouement of the book. If you find Ignatius' greed, sloth and personal habits hard to take, you may well prefer Jones - not that Jones is any kind of saint.<br /><br />All the characters and situations are finely described, and most certainly based on reality. In truth, though, they are caricatures. Elements of real people have been combined to produce characters that are larger than life, more naive, and produce a crisper and funnier dialogue than anything ever actually heard; and yet they have the ring of authenticity.<br /><br />On finishing A Confederacy of Dunces, you are likely to feel that you have got to know New Orleans much better - especially as it was before 2005, when hurricane Katrina drew a permanent line beneath the past. You will also have been much entertained, whilst at the same time being shown something rather sad both about the people portrayed and their creator.uth, though, they are caricatures.

B003Y5H4SO|3.0|A perfectly serviceable little horror flick. Great graphic for the posters and DVD covers though, with the red light through the elevator door creating an inverted cross image.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I had the same problem of it taking my location and then doing nothing.  I found that after entering location, if I hit the Fire &quot; back&quot; button,  the app then showed the blue weather bar at the bottom, and the &quot;refresh&quot; and GPS symbols on the app title line.  On pressing the refresh button, it loaded weather data!  It had lost my location, which I re-entered on the app's &quot;settings&quot; page, and it now works great.  I have always preferred this weather app over all others on my other platforms.  Hope this helps others in getting it running on Fire as well.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Impressive. To turn what could have been a dry, cerebral, dull autopsy of events into a gripping, witty, fast-paced, and still smart entertainment is quite an accomplishment. Kudos all around for the clever dialog, brisk direction and editing, first rate performances, and brilliant sound design.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Great app. in order to see all the messages in your inbox all you need to do is to browse the kindle in landscape position.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Well made and deliberately unspectacular (well, at least after the opening sequence). Thoughtful - well performed - human. It's not a homerun, but a lesser Clint Eastwood movie is still better than 90% of everything else in the theaters.
0812979702|4.0|The ideas presented in this book are very useful for golfers who are developing their golf swing and for those who already have a fully developed golf swing. Performing the mental exercises suggested in the book expands your prespective of what is involved in swinging a golf club. Combine the mental exercises with good mechnaics and the benefits magnify. This book is a worthwhile read and if you haven't read it, take the time to read it and try the exercises. A few thoughts from the author of [[ASIN:0981339204 The Golf Swing: It's All in the Hands]].

B002ZG975Q|5.0|I went into this movie with very low expectations actually, because i am just a big disney fan and yes i know it is a book before it was a disney classic but still i think of it as a disney movie and this as a human remake. But regarding my expectations this movie turned out to be really good movie with a really good story. The ending i thought was perfectly put together and i am no critic but i just thought the whole movie was just great. i would recommend this movie to a lot of people. it is a really good movie.
0439796636|5.0|Saw Al Roker talk about this book on the Today show.  I love horses and it sounded like such a great story, I had to have the book. It's a very short book and easy read.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great Blu-Ray set. Great picture quality and if you have a decent surround sound system you will love this. I wish they had included Empire of Dreams from the previous DVD release but otherwise the bonus features are good.
B004FOA84A|2.0|could be fun if it lasted longer and gave a little better clues. I wish I would have read reviews first. good graphics..wasn't much but wouldn't buy if I knew how long it was.
B004ZNARH4|4.0|First, a little about myself...been a Pink Floyd fan since the tender age of 14. Have all of the albums and CD's, indeed as of right now I have 14 different version of Dark Side Of the Moon on vinyl and CD (one of the most interesting is the Portuguese LP version \\"El Lada Obscuro de la Luna\\") I bought the 20th anniversary CD years ago, even have the promo poster for the unreleased 25th anniversary version (which was cancelled because somebody used their head and asked...why do we need another version?). I even have a slew of \\"unofficial\\" releases with live shows from the era and studio outtakes from the sessions. Fans have been clamoring for years for the band to put out the album plus outtakes, live versions, etc. Then this box set came out...  OK let's get this out of the way, only if you're a huge fan do you need this expansive (and some would say, expensive) box set. But if you do, what do you get for your hard-earned cash? Well let's take a look...  CD Disc #1 - Dark Side Of the Moon (2011 Remaster)  OK, just like the other \\"remasters\\" for the past 20 years, I really don't hear much of a difference. For my money, the MFSL gold disc is still the best version of this. However, that is long out of print and getting more expensive by the minute. And being this is supposed to be the definitive box set, I cannot fault the band for doing a new remaster and including it. After all, this is the whole reason for the box set.  CD Disc #2 - Dark Side Of the Moon (Live November 16, 1974 Wembley, UK)  Any Floyd collector worth their salt already has this on \\"unofficial\\" releases, but it's nice to see it has an official release here. And for the fan who hasn't heard this before, it's a treat.  DVD Disc #1 - AUDIO ONLY This includes the 5.1 surround mix as well as the Quad mix which was only available on LP when it first came out. For the hardcore, this is a nice inclusion as you can hear some differences in the mix vs the stereo version. Kudos for including it on here.  DVD Disc #2 - AUDIO AND VISUAL MATERIAL  Includes footage from 1972 which has not been available on DVD before. Unfortunately none of it is live Dark Side footage, supposedly there is no pro shot footage of that tour. Pity. However, all of the backdrop films from the 1974 & 1975 tours are here! This was one of the biggest reasons I picked up this box set! I checked them out and they are definitely interesting to watch, synced up with the live concert broadcast from 1974 Wembley. Two thumbs up for putting out that footage!  Blu Ray Disc - Comprises DVD Discs 1 & 2 on a Blu Ray Disc  CD Disc #3 - Studio outtakes and live tracks.  The main reason I picked up this box set. So what's on this disc? The original mix of Dark Side...it's interesting that that it's an early mix before all of the interview tracks were used...apart from that a lot of it is almost the same as the original album. I know I'm nitpicking here, but I'm kinda on the fence if this really needed to be released. Fortunately the rest of the disc is comprised of live tracks from the 1972 tour, a couple of demos, including \\"The Hard Way\\" from the unreleased follow up to the Dark Side record called \\"Household Objects\\" which was never released...thankfully!.  Also included: a Dark Side scarf, 3 marbles with prisms, a \\"Lichenstein\\" print of the album cover, \\"Questions for Assorted Lunatics\\", backstage pass and ticket from the 1973 tour, 4 collectors card (collect 'em all!), 2 booklets of text and photos, and and set of 9 drink coasters. And of course, a box to hold all of this ephemera.  So, does the box set merit the money? As a Floyd fan, I'd say yes, especially for the unreleased disc of outtakes, the live show and the screen films. However, if you're a bit less than a hardcore fan, you can pass on the immersion box set and stick with the other version that came out with the studio and live version of Dark Side, that should be more than enough.  Oh yeah, this makes version #15 for me then of DSOM...
0307891372|5.0|This Guide is really detailed with many added features such as the Skyrim map, Crafting, Inventory ,quests and map sections.

B004TYW2EA|4.0|Purchased this product 2 weeks ago from Amazon.com and requested delivery via USPS to Indonesia. The package arrived 5 days earlier than the expected period given, which is a plus point. Opened the box for the first time and i am impressed with the size and shape of the device. I think it is beautifully made. However Kokkia does not provide anything beside the device. A small pouch to store the device when not in use would be great. I connected the dongle to my ipod Nano 6th generation and linked it with my bluetooth stereo headphone (Creative WP-300). Connection was very easy as easy as plug and play. It reconnected automatically without having to link the two devices together again. The only setback is that the use of bluetooth dongle reduce the battery life of nano tremendously which I think it makes sense because the dongle use the ipod's power to run. There is no power button (on/off) available which mean you can't connect the device permanently to your ipod without draining your battery life. I think a power button would solve the problem rather than having to plug it and out each time you wanna use it.  In conclusion:  pro: beautifully made in terms of size and shape, easy connectivity.  cons: no power button, drain battery life.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|I have no experience with Ultraviolet, so I will just stick to the movie. Don't bother with this one. I really don't know what everyone saw in this movie. If I wanted to see Hangover, I would watch the original again, not a stale, copy placed in another country. Same settings and even lines as the first one, and they seemed to stretch scenes to help this piece of junk limp along. If youve seen the first one, you could anticipate the points of plot change in this one. Even same Kanye and Cash in the Soundtrack, really, they cant even change it up a little? I really like the first one, but I couldn't even finish this one, as I didn't care about it and I could pretty much guess how the last 30-40 min would play out. The jokes were to the point where I was looking at my girl wondering if I was missing something as there was silence between us(all of the funnier scenes were in the trailers, so if you saw that, don't go any further). No content, weak acting, humorless attempt; but just a horrible excuse to capitalize on a great first movie. Of course they would in this business, but I ended up leaving the room to finish my damn laundry...really! I borrowed this from a friend and I am so glad I didn't waste my time paying for this in the movies or on BR, cause I would certainly ask for my money back.  Show Hollywood that you expect more by avoiding this.
B005KMX866|4.0|My husband loves Chris Isaak, so when I saw he had a new album coming out I ordered it as a pre-order.  I didn't realize it was all covers, all of which were well done, but a little too old-time country for my husband's taste.  Personally, I like the album a lot, Chris does a great job of covering some classic country songs.  He really does the songs justice, without sounding like an impersonator.
B002NXSRVG|2.0|While many like myself remember the beloved 80's series fondly with the cast of Duke,Flint,Scarlet,Lady J,Cobra Commander,Destro,Baroness and tons more this sad pathetic live remake of that beloved series was just an insult that should never have been made like this.  The cast in itself wasn't the real problem but the poor and shallow storyline for the movie is, but that's kind of expected with once good director Stephen Sommers leading the way of this seemingly today version of the Mummy.  The small story is you have Destro with the help of a unknown scientist and the Baroness plotting to take over the world and it's up to the joint special forces unit of various countries called Joe to stop him and his nefarious plot.  We also get the introduction of Duke and Ripcord who after being ambushed by Cobra and rescued by G.I. Joe demand to join the shadow unit and help stop Destro,  of course you can't have this kind of cheesy movie without the romantic entanglement and angst between a couple of characters but one story between one of the couples is such a joke it tightropes on pathetic or predictably stupid your choice.  Considering the amount of money it took to make the movie you would think the effects would be a lot better,  sadly while not the worse I've ever seen it still was pretty sad to see these kinds of effects on such a big budgeted movie.  While the movie might be a guilty late night movie for people with nothing else to do I'd hardly call this a summer block buster or even a matinee movie.  So for fans of the 80's series if you want I'd say take a peek but keep any expectations far down about enjoying the movie to much...
B0057UA4FY|5.0|Probably the best show on television. You don't have to be a fan of the movies to enjoy the first season. Clone Wars has really made up for those god-awful prequels. Focusing on characters like yoda, Anakin and Obi-One have made this first season a must have.

Makes me want to jump on a plane right now and go. It's a sweet love story.  One you can watch over and over and still enjoy.  Well, at least I can.
1451627289|5.0|Don't expect to be horrified. The horror here is far more subtle than in the classics like Pet Cemetary and the Shining. I didn't have any nightmares or have to sleep with the lights blazing. What I did experience here was some great, detailed writing dealing with the nifty 50's, the concepts and problems of time travel, and some bonding time with a wonderful protagonist, Jake Epping, alias George Amberson when he travels in the 50's/60's. Now, I generally hate history, and you can't get the two of us in the same room without much cringing and crying. However, I didn't ever feel that I was being preached history to, or feel the need to throw the book into the corner and go outside to get some 2011 air. This is because I felt so connected to the characters in this book, and it stopped me from feeling that sense of being unmoored and unaquainted with the 60's. I learned plenty concerning the dynamics of the Kennedy assanation and Lee Harvey Oswald's history. And if half of its correct(I'm hoping Mr. King wasn't being too creative, I honestly wouldn't know) then I believe I'm ready to have a conspiracy theory session with the best of them. The best kind of learning is learning when you don't know it, all the rest is mostly misery.<br /><br />I also experienced moments of pulse pounding anticipation, especially in the homestretch of the last 100 or so pages. As far as this book being what some may deem \\"too long\\" I really don't think so. Actually, it felt just right despite being around 800 or so pages. This is because there were never any tangents to be got off on, and it wasn't packed with a gazillion characters. I enjoyed this book way more than Under The Dome, which was equally long and seemed to go in a thousand seperate lines. No fluffy bunnies for the chopping block in this book. I think this ties with Duma Key, which I absolutely loved because King gave us a solid character to care about, and his writing is detailed but never went over the edge where I wanted to skip sections. The plot moves forwards and it simmers, then finally begins to boil full force.<br /><br />As for the ending, I won't go into spoiling that at all, but I thought it was beautiful and perfect. If you don't get a lump in your throat, you might not be human. Strangely, I saw the end coming because I thought to myself that it was best way to tie everything up.<br />After finishing the book, I recommend listening to \\"The Scientist\\" by Coldplay, because I feel like the song and the time travel theme fit together in an awesome way.(Oh, take me back to the start!!) Which, after finishing the book, you'll likely want to do because you'll be sad the journey's over.<br />Highly recommended!tions.

Which, after finishing the book, you'll likely want to do because you'll be sad the journey's over.   Highly recommended!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was excellent, and one of Stephen King's better books. I would recommend this others whole heartedly.  Great premise, great writing, all around great.
B00006YXP0|5.0|Don't miss this wonderful DG box set (8 discs) of one of the greatest pianists and teachers the world has known.  In Bach, he has the feel of Glenn Gould; with Mozart, he would make Clara Haskil delighted, and his Debussy is nonpareil.  An incredibly gifted musician, almost flawless, who transposed his soul to the music.
B000244FDW|5.0|Elizabeth Garvie, as Elizabeth Bennett, is the quintessential \\"Lizzie.\\"  She embodies how I visualize the character.  This program is the closest to the book of any of the video adaptations.
B0034G4P94|5.0|In a summer overcrowded by superheroes movies, WARRIOR went largely overlooked.  Instead of high octane explosions and big-budget special effects, this was a movie with well fascinating real-world characters, drama, and some amazing fights.<br /><br />Lonely old Paddy Conlon, (played by hoarse-voiced Nick Nolte of 48 HOURS and CAPE FEAR fame) is a retired mill worker and reformed drunk whose abused wife and angry children have not spoken to him for years.  He finds himself drawn back into family life when his son, Tommy (Played by Tom Hardy--who should become a household name for playing Bane in the upcoming Batman movie), now in the Marine Corps, shows up on his doorstep with a bottle of booze.  Tommy has a chip on his shoulder that could fill the Grand Canyon.  By all appearances, his only reason for visiting his father is to express his hate exercise the hateful demons that vex his every thought.<br /><br />While visiting dear old dad, Tommy becomes a member of the local mixed martial arts gym.  As it turns out, he is a natural-born killer in the ring.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Paddy Conlon's other estranged son, a soft-spoken high school teacher named Brendan (played by Joel Edgerton--Anakin's step-brother in REVENGE OF THE SITH), re-enters mixed martial arts in the hope of stopping the bank from foreclosing on his home.<br /><br />Paddy has dreams of bringing his family back together, but his sons hate him and his wife is dead.  Instead of bringing his adult sons under his wing, he finds himself rebuffed by both of his boys as they  prepare to enter a high-stakes mixed martial arts tournament called \\"Spartan.\\"<br /><br />The twists and turns in this movie are sometimes predictable, but not unwelcomed.  The acting is generally amazing.  Hardy (who is British) and Edgerton (an Australian) are convincing as  martial artists and also as Philadelphians.  Nolte, an old pro, is sympathetic throughout.<br /><br />The fighting scenes are well done but it is the Cinderella story that really pulls you in.

B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|[[ASIN:B005WLQQ4Q Elevate]]I can't get enough of them, they're one of my favorite bands and has always been since they first came out. I think this CD is better than the first one, even though I love them both. Keep up the good job BTR.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|perfect!was exactly as described. had been looking for this title for yeas and finally found it, at a great price and it arrived very quickly
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This CD cuts to the bone and brings chills to your spine-especially if you've read the Heroin Diaries. Great group, great lyrics, deep songs. Hold onto your seats, it's a lovely, beautiful ride that is quite near the brink of insanity at the same time. I have a copy in every vehicle I own, every room in my house. YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!
B003AWRM9W|4.0|Clint's bounty hunter is obviously a parody character based on his other roles. The movie was interesting and a little bizarre, but I think he was having fun with the production, and with the audience. While Peters is not generally leading lady material there is something appealing and vulnerable about the woman she portrays, and it plays well to Eastwood's sentimental tough guy. If you're looking for humor and action but don't expect a lot of plot depth or original story line it's an entertaining flick.
B000MV9026|5.0|Excellent Movie and was very enjoyable-- glad to have purchased it, The whole Movie was interesting and kept your attention.  Animation for this one was outstanding.[[ASIN:B000MV9026 Happy Feet (Full Screen Edition)]]
0385535139|4.0|THIS BOOK STARTS VERY SLOW, BUT EXCITEMENT BUILDS AS THE PLOT THICKENS. GRISHAM DOES A NICE JOB OF BUILDING A STORY AND FINISHING STRONG.
B001GBUD4A|5.0|All songs in this album are awesome. Tony Kakko`s voice is amazing and the combination between guitars and keyboards are amazing ( not to mention the great drums work here).  Before I listened to Sonata, I was told it was a Stratovarius copycat but it's not true at all.   Sonata Arctica has its own trademark and is much more powerful than Strato (I like very much Stratovarius but I mean there's a noticeable difference between these two bands).  Don't doubt to have it in your metal collection, every time I listen to it I feel better and \\"energized\\".
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Great movie with a lot of classic one liners. Something I'll have playing in the background while doing house duty.
B0011Z5IVE|1.0|Stay away from this 'deal'. It is the original mastering from almost 20 years ago. The sound is terrible. No refunds either!
630469654X|5.0|A fantasy epic, lots of symbolism and humor.  Interesting and enjoyable, although the cinematic quality was lowq, story was interesting and fun.
B005YVTHT0|5.0|I've had a lot of fun playing with this little sucker today.  Frankly, I didn't think I'd like it very much.  I requested it before I realized what it was.  I thought it was a steering wheel with a steering column you attach to a desk, similar to my Logitech Driving Force steering wheel.  It's actually an accelerometer... and you hold the wheel, unattached to anything, and with no feedback, just rotate it.  The pedals are large paddles, and the gear shifters are smaller clicky paddles.  I've played Mario Kart with a wiimote, and thought it was a bit of a gimmick, so I expected this to be the same.  It's really much better, though.    For one, the accuracy is excellent.  Despite the lack of feedback, this is a precise way to steer.  I can adjust the sensitivity with a knob, so with a couple of adjustments, I was getting the car to do exactly what I want.  The way they designed the 'pedals' (paddles) makes for very accurate braking and throttle, so I can easily feather the throttle for drifting and oversteer control.  It really is excellent for what it sets out to do.  You can control a car with the same precision you'd expect from a more traditional game steering wheel.  No exaggeration.  I also found the controller to be built well.  For the price, I would expect the controller to be solid, with proper response from buttons and paddles and knobs.  It all feels very well built.  The gear shifters produce a satisfying click, the buttons produce a satisfying thump, and the knobs all are great.  The USB cable is probably the most sturdy data cable I've ever seen.  I could probably use this steering wheel as a grappling hook without breaking it.  When you picture steering around a corner, holding a detached wheel, turning your ABS up (you can select an aid with the center knob, and then adjust with the right knob), doesn't it sound like this will be awkward?  It actually is easy UNLESS you need to switch from braking to throttling mid adjustment, as either of the hands doing the adjustment is needed for either braking or throttling.  So I learned to adjust during accelerations out of the corners, where I'm very unlikely to need the brakes.  The buttons you need while racing all are in the radius of your two thumbs, so you can hit any of those at any time you like, and it's surprising how quickly you get used to them.  I found the LEDs, especially the blue ones (for when your car is over the rev limit) to be on the bright side, but they do look pretty impressive.  Also, I love being able to lounge on a couch while racing.  I have an awkward desk mounted setup for my very well made Logitech setup, with pedals, etc, and I won't be using it again because this SRW-S1 is simply a better way to control the car when playing games from the sofa.  Now for a couple of cons:  This lacks any sort of vibration or force feedback, which of course I miss.    Even though the website said it doesn't work on my PS3, I did play around in Gran Turismo 5 vainly hoping I could get it to do more than move around the menus.  This doesn't work on a PS3... it's for PC games.  I'd be very pleased to see a PS3 version come to the market.  It's also mainly for the Simraceway game.  A lot of the buttons and the rev lights do not work in other PC racers (though it works as a steering wheel on every PC racer I tried).  So I've been practicing Simraceway (a game I had never heard of) a bit.  You can download it for free and try it yourself and see if it's your kind of game.  It reminds me a lot of iracing, though doesn't have many users (I assume this is a new community).  The physics were great, but the graphics are nothing like Gran Turismo (perhaps because my graphics card is not meant for games).  I found Simraceway to be a competent driving simulator, and hopefully the community grows, but it's not for everyone.  As this is a new product, I suspect support for it will increase, and I'll update if I find that to be the case.  I also think this kind of wheel would be ideal if they released a wireless version, but the USB cable is pretty long.  Bottom line is that this is a product for a particular use: simulation racing on PCs.  It has surpassed my expectations for that use, and the build quality justifies the price tag.  EDIT: I've also added a photo with my Logitech gamepad and a mint for scale, so you can understand the size.  It's a little smaller than I thought it would be, just looking at the product photo on Amazon.  BTW, I am happy with the size.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Pros:  -The amplifier system is awesome and the dual channel setup letting you change game and chat volume separately is wonderful.  -Sound quality is good for the price and I had no real complaint in that department.  Wire from the USB jack to the amp is very durable and long, but almost too long.  -Works with both my PS3 and PC.  Cons:  -The Ear Pads will stain EVERYTHING black.  I was sitting there wondering what was causing these black ovals all over my clothes, hats, sofa, pillows, and blankets only to find out that the ear pads from this thing will stain any light colored cloth around.  -The Speakers started to die out after only a few months and it was most likely a result of how cheap the wire was once again making me wish i got a wireless headset instead.  -The wire from the amp to the speakers was very cheap and lost all its flexibility in a matter of months making the cord even more unbearable.  -Length of the cord is horrendously long and makes you wish you had just bought a wireless set instead.  -Plastic feels very cheap and the joints as a result feel poorly made.  My advice would be to find a good wireless set to avoid the speaker problems that occur from similar cord related issues.  This headset in particular was just a mess and only lasted 6 months before breaking and staining a bunch of stuff in my house.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Jaw-dropping documentary of the financial mess.  Insightful interviews were complete, including notes about how some of them personally benefited - at everyone's expense, worldwide.
B004ZNA5JO|4.0|I'm a big fan of PF. I do agree this is not their best album... Nevertheless, and despite the 80's sound on it (specially on the drums), the lyrics are great. Sorrow, for instance, is a masterpiece (though I like the PULSE version a little more). On The Turning Away has a great solo, very Gilmour-like. I would not say this is a bad album. It was a new start... which would be concluded later on with The Division Bell. I guess you only need some time to get used to it, if you're new to Pink Floyd.   For more experienced listeners, though, it is notable that the sound somehow went back a little. I think the Meddle sounds more 'alive' and 'Floydian'.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|Good music. Good dancing. Servicable plot. What's not to like? I enjoy the entertainment value of this movie. I like the  classic dancing story line of the movie. Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy hooks up with girl again.

B00288KNJU|5.0|A dark and creepy film about family relationships directed by Henry Selick of Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach fame, Coraline is based on the haunting book Coraline by Neil Gaiman. The first stop-motion feature shot in stereoscopic 3-D, Coraline features big-headed, stick-bodied animated characters with huge eyes and demonic grins set against menacing backgrounds and an undercurrent of spooky music. Coraline is a teenager who has just moved to an old house in the middle of nowhere with her writer parents and she is bored, bored, bored............

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am a recent convert to Adele's music, but she has made me a believer.  Her lyrics and her delivery absolutely transport you into her world.  In other words, I thoroughly enjoy her.
B00457X8BC|4.0|Henning Mankell, like PD James, is a serious novelist who works in the murder mystery format.  This is the second th Kurt Wallander books I have read, and both feature a thoughtful, analytical detective dealing with life, family, love, society and a murder case.     After two dead bodies in a life raft float assore on the Sweden's coastal village of Ystad, and are determined to be from Eastern Europe, Wallander is drawn into the corrupt police state of neighboring Latvia.  There he falls in love with the widow of his murdered Latvian doepplanger. We get a visceral sense of the desperate \\"no where to run\\" terror of living in a corrupt police state.     There are aspects of the plot that seem contrived. I'm still sure I understand why Wallender actually HAD to go to Latvia, other than to further the storyline. But I recommend the book highly as being several cuts above the run of the mill murder story.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|I do not understand the negative reviews for this movie, I found it highly enjoyable for adults and kids alike. Great movie!!!!
B005UKJX4E|5.0|This isn't a typical film.  It's not for some teenage date night.  It's not a mindless action romp meant to entertain every split second.  It's thought provoking and beautiful.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|A classic movie from my childhood, remastered, and clearer than I've ever seen it. They didn't add or change anything (unlike certain other childhood favorites), just cleaned it up so that it looks beautiful.

B005GP7F8Y|1.0|This supposed Blu-Ray disc of One-Eyed Jacks is nowhere near as good as my VHS version in EP. It is a joke. Amazon should remove this junk from its normal excellent selection. I'd prefer watching a full screen version on tv with commercials to this travesty.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read on self-publishing and book promotion, and I have read many for my final graduate school project. Sure other books mentioned some of what John Locke says, but he puts it all together in an awesome business plan and explains step-by-step how to implement it. He also clearly understands the epublishing business, today's publishing landscape, and book promotion via social media networks. This book is a must-read for any author who wants to self-publish and get away from chasing after publishers and agents.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I know Lars Ulrich tries hard to come across as an intellectual art lover and why not? But don't bother the METAL community with your experiments. You should have never put the name Metallica on the cd cover, because this whole experiment has totally failed on all fronts. It's like you're listening to 2 cd's at the same time, wow what an experiment! This should never have been released, period!  Greetz from a dutch Metallica fan since No life till leather!
B004QSQML8|1.0|Not sure why Amazon keeps asking me to review this DVD.  I never bought it.  When I did buy a movie, this one was shipped to me by mistake.  Amazon took it back and shipped me the correct one.<br />I am familiar with Legend anyway....sucks unless you are an eleven year old.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Great interpretation by Gregg Allman of songs written many years ago in his usual solo-style. Great collaberation by Guitar musician and Producer T Bone Burnett. Only one song was written was written by Gregg Allman but it fits so seamlessly within the other songs that you almost cannot tell the variance within the whole album. I am very pleased with the liner notes also. Thank you.

0446615625|5.0|This is the first in a series of good story telling. The camel club is a group of seemingly discordant individuals, all of whom have backgrounds that appear to comprise an eclectic that somehow completes the puzzle well. Be Forewarned, however, that once you begin the series, you will be reading all of the books.

B002VECMAO|1.0|This movie is terrible.  The only funny scenes are the ones that are in the trailer. Maybe if you were high, this movie would be better. It is pure nonsense and (another word to describe feces that begins with an \\"s\\" and end with a \\"t\\").
0439023513|1.0|Horrible and boring.  The first two books dragged a little in places and the writer's style is obnoxious and just plain bad.  This book makes very little sense and is really drawn out.  Impossible to read.

1451648537|5.0|This was a very well written and easy to read biography.  Non fiction is not my usual choice, but I was interested in learning more about Steve Jobs and this book was informative without being boring.  Jobs' had a very interesting life and did so much to change the way our world operates now.  This book gives the reader a glimpse into what went into the making of all Apple's products.  Anyone who loves Mac will enjoy this book.

B005JZBP8W|5.0|The best transfer ever of the film on a video medium.<br />Please read Bluray.com's review below:<br />'My Fair Lady's extravagant sets and costumes often sparkle on Blu-ray. Colors are quite gorgeous and stand out as the transfer's best asset. From the opening shot of well-dressed socialites leaving the opera forward, the transfer yields sparkling hues, generally well-balanced and harmonious, looking as exquisitely natural as ever. Even the bright white social circle scenes and the very warm interior of Higgins' office offer stability and evenness. Black levels are strong throughout, even as dark suits and black carriages bump up against shadowy backgrounds at film's open. Fine detail is strong, but not perfect. Faces and clothes, of course mainstays of Blu-ray visual efficiency, look quite good, but so too do everything from Eliza's wicker flower basket to brick façades, wooden textures, and even dirt on the ground, all of which are presented with a natural, almost tactile appearance. Clarity is strong, but the image does appear to drift into softness and edge murkiness every now and again. It's also dotted by occasional speckles, but the print appears to be in otherwise fine shape. This isn't the snazziest looking catalogue title on Blu-ray, but Paramount's 1080p release is solid all around and should please longtime fans looking to enjoy the boost in resolution and stability the format offers.'<br /><br />THIS PART IS MY REVIEW:<br />Cukor's `My Fair Lady' is not innovative or an example of where cinema would be headed at the time of its release. In a year of Kubrick's riveting `Dr. Strangelove' and Lester's creative `A Hard Day's Night', `My Fair Lady', is more like Hitchcock's masterpiece `Marnie' of the same year. These two latter films; are a testament of how well these two filmmakers understand the craft of filmmaking and the language of cinema. So why does `My Fair Lady' stand out as my personal best of the year? Because you could fill an arena full of directors from the beginning of cinema to present day and there would only be a handful, which project such talent and ease for this kind of material! Cukor's film is filled with wonderfully executed scenes, without the aid of extravagant sets and when he builds a large set of a race track, he does it with minimal means and only the camera and editing to give it the panache, it needs to succeed as a sequence. When directors were starting to lean on big, unusual sets as in `Dr. Strangelove' (which I love) or on modern day sensibilities and wild camera movements, as in `A Hard Day's Night' (which l also love), Cukor was proving, simplicity and style could make superb, intellectual entertainment! Therefore nineteen sixty-four's most original statement was `My Fair Lady'!
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I just have one thing to say about all these 1 star reviews, why? I mean you're reviewing a movie not a technology. The story was a fitting conclusion to the book series. Was it a perfect screenplay? No it was not, but neither was the LOTR. I can understand mentioning in a review that you are unhappy with a format, I can't understand how you can make it the most important part of a movie review.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Good seller, product and shipping.  Good storytelling, with the lessons of life weaving their way through the various characters in this film, especially if you've gone through/going through a death in your own family. It brings real meaning behind old traditions, most of which are lost along the way of 'progress' as new 'traditions' are manufactured for the new consumer age in which memory is lost and forgotten.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this unusual and unique book. You will too (my 70 y.o. mom -who only reads trashy romance novels- loved it!). Great story, characters, and settings! Made my top ten ever!!!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Good seller, product and shipping etc.  Good storyline given it's a family friendly film. The use of the Stuxnet virus developed by the DOD/CIA/Mossad intel agencies to target Iran and others was interesting, especially in that it was 'tested' on Japan, an assumed ally, but then that's how it is usually done if you know anything about past bio agent R&D programs.  Nice film.
B005AEQX0C|5.0|The Wanted is back with their follow up album titled \\"Battleground.\\" There are so many hit songs : Glad You Came, Gold Forever, Lightning and thier latest single Warzone. My favorite song off the album is \\"Rocket\\". It's a great album to listen. I suggest you check out some samples from the album. You certainly won't be disappointed.
007174889X|5.0|I've enjoyed Harrison's for years and this latest version is still a fabulous resource whether I need a quick reference or would like an in-depth treatment. Lots of helpful images, video clips, charts, and diagrams. The writing is formal but usually quite clear and to the point. I find it an essential resource for practicing medicine!
B003VANOFY|1.0|the g930 suck!  for the price they don't connect to PS3 of xbox.  sold as gamer hearphones are more like music ONLY hearphones...  if you are a gamer DO NOT BUY it...waste of money and time...!!!  Last LOGITECH crap I buy!
0440241901|5.0|A light read..that keeps you reading! Really loved it. Couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I thought it was kind of slow at first..then I read a review that said that but said to keep going! I did and am so glad I did!
B005JU5JTI|3.0|I was wanting to enjoy this movie.  Cameron Diaz was as good as ever but the writing just did not grab me.  If you are in to romantic comedies and enjoy looking at Cameron Diaz, you might give this a try.  If by chance you want to laugh out loud or expect quality in your movies, you might pass on this one.
B003NWS5AO|3.0|I first saw Robert Plant and the Band of Joy on Artists Den and absolutely loved the show!  So many of my favorite musicians and singers are in the band.  The mix was great, the songs were fun and the performance was just genius.  After seeing that, I was looking forward to buying any music from this group.  When I first saw this CD available to purchase, I immediately wanted to buy it.  While listening to the CD, I noticed that the mix was quite a bit different - too much of the electric guitar.  It overpowered the songs.  Instead of the collaboration of all the voices and instruments, combining to make great songs layered with the genius of multiple performers, I heard way too much of the electric guitar and this made the songs much blander.  The CD isn't a total failure, but the mix (and perhaps a lack of some acoustic instruments?  I hadn't read the liner notes yet) makes the songs less enjoyable.  I just now listened to one of the live songs online and was convinced that I wasn't just forgetting what the live songs sounded like.  The live show with its mix was much better.  This group CAN have some great (wonderful) songs and great performances, but it's got to be the entire collaboration and the right mix.  I don't think this CD got it quite right.
B003OF3R0S|5.0|The 5-man Huntington Beach, CA band, A7X, comes back with their 5th album, just short of 3 years since their last release (the longest time in between releases for them, since they dropped their first album [that I know of] back in early 2002).  I'm kind of new to them and listen to a lot more hip-hop music (probably around 85 % of my 1300 or so CD's I own), but I do listen to some other types, and I have to say I am a big fan of Avenged Sevenfold & seeing them live definitely helped make me like them more.  This is the 1st CD of theirs that I listened to, and have since bought 2 more.  Of the 11 songs on here, I'd have to say 3 are Classics, 1 is almost classic material, 4 I'd say are ok and the others are good or real good songs; and I have no problem listening to the album straight through, other than maybe repeating some songs.  They have do a very good job with the harder-type get you pumped up songs; as well as some of the softer more personal ones (especially the Classic tribute on here to their late drummer, \\"The Rev\\").  I'd definitely recommend picking this up and I will be getting more familiar with them & their past releases.  #1 - 10 (Classic, great song and 1 of the 2 that drew my attention to them)  #2 - 9.5 (another Great track)  #3 - 8.5  #4 - 10 (Another Classic that I'm glad is now getting a lot of radio play)  #5 - 8  #6 - 10 (CLASSIC - great deeper song dedicated to their drummer, Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan, who died right after X-Mas in '09)  #7 - 7.5 (harder metal-type sounding song, just misses its target slightly)  #8 - 7  #9 - 8  #10 - 6.5  #11 - 7.5  M.

030726999X|5.0|Excellent read...couldn't put it down until finished reading...almost!<br />Have read all three books in series...\\"The Girl Who....\\" and all are excellent, spellbinding tales!
0060920084|4.0|The first thing I'll remind the reader is that this look at smalltown America took place in the late 1980's.  So it is interesting to read what he Bryson sees changing in our country that actually came into being.  (Example - our culture lacks patience; we want everything right now.) (Example 2 - visit to the Ford museum finds mostly foreign cars in the parking lot)  I found the book well written and very witty.  There is an underlying sad tone to the book though.  Bryson is recreating some family trips following the death of his father.  So he is remembering past trips and missing his father.  Also, he is finding some parts of the country where Americans are not as friendly as he had hoped.  He remembers the warmth of people during his childhood trips.  I would recommend this book for those who enjoy books with a bite and a healthy dose of sarcasm.  Also, the comparisons are interesting, from Bryson's childhood to what he finds in the 80's to what you the reader see happening today.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I found this movie on netflix and just fell in love with it.  ITs is funny and silly and just great.  I love it
B005I0DLXK|5.0|A steal for $4.99. I don't have to tell you about most the songs on the album as they are played frequently on the radio. S&M is inappropriate for the kids but very catchy. If even you're not into S&M you'll find yourself singing this one.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love this show and the movie is the same quality as Firfly.  I highly recomend to all firefly fans
B004UXUUDA|4.0|This film is one of my 2011 favorites, by a wide margin. I won't add too much more to the many excellent reviews, except to comment on the Amazon featured review, in which the point is made of the historical part of the story being much better than the present day portion.   In the book, Julia had to work very hard to discover information about Sarah and her family. She was stonewalled by her husband's family for most of her search, and they only gave in when overwhelmed with her persistence and discoveries. She also had the issue of her husband's long-time and ongoing affair, which the director of the film chose to ignore. Her discoveries in America were only possible with the help of her sister in New York City.   True, the film has more richness in its' presentation of the history than the present, but that's a decision the director made. When I read the book I thought the richest part of the story was Julia's not Sarah's. So it's a valid criticism of the film, but for people like myself who read the book ahead of time, we knew that Julia's search was not the \\"everything drops right into place\\" scenario the director chose for us, but the result of hard work by a talented, dedicated and driven journalist and caring woman. Presenting the complete story of Julia, I feel, would have made Kristen Scott-Thomas a front runner candidate for the best actress Academy Award. As it is, her considerable talent has made the story of Julia better than the limited version of that part of the book the director chose to present. I think she'll still get some Oscar buzz, but if she had been given more to work with she would be getting more than buzz.
B005IGVYUG|4.0|He has been called 'America's best kept secret'.  The man, the myth, the legend; Tom Waits. Over the past two weeks, a lot of people have asked me how I like the new Tom Waits album- so I figured being such a fan- I should finally sit down and officially talk about it.<br /><br />Bad as Me, marks Waits' 23nd official studio album release, not counting one-off's he's done for films, compilations, benefits, and whatever else tickles his fancy. One can write an entire book (and people have!) on how this man has influenced the last 5 decades of music. People who haven't heard of him don't even realize they know him by way of his acting, or by the huge volume of his catalog that has been covered by artists such as Los Lobos, Bruce Springsteen, Rod Stewart, The Eagles, Primus, The Ramones, Diana Krall, Bon Jovi, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Charlie Musselwhite, Madeleine Peyroux and Scarlet Johansson, just to name a few.<br /><br />Those who do know him, annoyingly describe him as the man with the raspy, gravelly voice. But his fans know better; for a man who has such a low register, he can certainly alter his voice to make this his most important instrument, having the range to be able to sound like a modern day Howlin Wolf- to an amazing ghostly falsetto- and everything in between. As for style, Waits has done it all: blues, rock, country, R&B, hip hop, folk, ethnic- you name it, Waits has dabbled with it.<br /><br />All these influences, styles and experimentation are brought to  Bad as Me. With co-creator, co-writer, co-producer and wife of almost 30 years, Kathleen Brennan, they have constructed a slick, tight knit album, with most of the 12 songs (15 if you got the deluxe edition) no more than 3 and a half minutes in length. The variety of the song selection almost reads as a 'best of' for Waits, with each cut echoing a particular style he has inhabited over the years, while some even make the listener recollect a prior album. This may sound like a complaint, but it isn't; not one of the tracks is filler, and I will be as bold as to predict that every one of these songs will be covered in the future, from a huge canon of artists.<br />Speaking of artists, Waits has alot of his friends sitting in with him on this LP: Les Claypool, Flea, Marc Ribot, Keith Richards, Charlie Musselwhite, David Hidalgo and even his son, Casey, (who has been playing along side dad on percussion for almost a decade now) who all stop by to play on a tune or two- or three.<br /><br />The album starts out with the rocking tune called \\"Chicago\\", a 21st century blues and R&B floor stomping,  traveling song, about the migration of the African American community in the early to mid 40's from the South when the farming industry started to dry up, to the urban, industrial, factory bergs up north such as Detroit, Pittsburgh, or, Chicago. This is one of the songs motifs Waits is brilliant with, as if you are waiting on the corner and he speeds by in his '49 chopped-top Merc and without even stopping, grabs you by the arm and takes you along for the ride.  Much like \\"Hang on St. Christopher\\" from his 1987's Frank's Wild Years, are great examples of road songs where the audience is propelled into motion and before you know it, some part of your body is moving and keeping rhythm. The 2nd romp is \\"Raised Right Man\\", a 12 bar tune that sports the only other time I've heard the phrase \\" Heavens to murkatroid\\" used aside from the cartoon character Snagglepuss. This song introduces us to new characters in the Waits psyche, \\"Mackey Debiasi\\", \\"Gunplay Maxwell\\", Flat Nose George\\" and \\"Ice Pick Ed Newcomb\\", and gives us brilliant words of wisdom that fans have come to know for years: \\"There ain't enough raised right men; it takes a raised right man to keep a happy hen.\\"<br /><br />We get a slow melodic venture for our next cut, \\"Talking At the Sametime\\", with Waits employing his falsetto over the spooky journey into darkness. Waits comments on what's going on right now: \\"The wardrags on; We bailed out the millionaires; It's hard times for some and for others it's sweet\\" and he also reminds us to save our money because  remember, \\"umbrellas always cost more in the rain\\".<br /><br />Waits does a little rock-a-billy number called \\"Get Lost\\", a great tune about breaking away and escaping everything, getting away from it all and just getting lost. This is something you could hear Elvis doing in his prime with it's pace and beat. He even references this in the song, \\"Roll up all the windows, turn up the Wolfman Jack/Please, please love me tender, ain't nothing wrong with that...\\"Next up is another eerie travel song, \\"Face to the Highway\\", another example of Waits' use of word play that ends up being so much more thought provoking. \\"Ocean wants a sailor/Gun wants a hand/Devil wants a sinner/Table wants a dinner\\".<br /><br />\\"Pay Me\\", the next track on the album, is sung (in my opinion) closest to Waits' natural speaking voice. Very haunting, he sings about how they pay him not to come home and keep him stoned- here, he is a female entertainer who is stuck at the same flophouse or cabaret- saying \\"I'll kick my foot at the lights; All the roads lead to the end of the world, I sewed a little luck in the hem of my gown/ The only way down from the gallows is to swing.\\" The songs end with an absolutely haunting staccato piano part, which almost makes the educated listener think that this poor girl is stuck living upstairs in that B&B on the border that Marlene Dietrich runs in Touch of Evil. \\"Back in the Crowd\\" is a lovely mariachi number that almost seems like Roy Orbinson himself could have penned and sang. Asking a lover to reassure them of their love or to put them 'back in the crowd', as if to give them that sweet ultimatum.<br /><br />Then we get to the real bread and butter: the title track. This is one of the examples that show how much of a genius Waits and Brennan can be when writing lyrics. At first, the  little-off phases come off as nothing more than a play on words. But after some thought, they become amazing little vignettes- almost stills on flash cards being flipped through, for the listener to do want they want with them- to invent whatever story you will with these little 'starting points'. \\"I'm the hat on the bed, the coffee instead/the fish or cut bait, the detective of late/the blood on the floor, the thunder and the roar/the boat that won't sing, I just won't sleep a wink\\", -all trying to explain to a lover that \\"you are the same kind of Bad as Me\\". It really is a brilliant piece of writing and performance. This is a good place to highlight the fact that Waits varies the tone, pitch and delivery of his lyrics in every song. His delivery for this track is panicked, frantic, almost cracking at times. He also adds in the little \\"Huhh!\\" 's that James Brown famously invented for his songs to add emphasise in certain places.<br /><br />\\"Kiss Me\\" is a slow ballad which will undoubtedly become a jazz standard, a ghostly tune much like his \\"Blue Valentines\\" of three decades ago. It's sound is crackled and muffled, as if transferred off an old 78, and it tells the tale of the lover wanting their partner to \\"Kiss me like a stranger once again\\". He wants to feel like his loves a \\"mystery\\" or a \\"sin\\", it is a beautiful piece of songwriting. \\"Satisfied\\" is a foot stomping cut that seems to answer the Rolling Stone's statement, \\"I can't get no Satisfaction\\", stating boldly: \\"I will have satisfaction, I will be satisfied, before I'm gone.\\" Keith Richards guests on guitar as he rattles out the accompaniment, with Waits even calling out him and his bandmate: \\"Now Mr. Jagger, Mr. Richards, I will scratch what I've been itching\\".<br /><br />\\"Last Leaf\\" is a beautiful, tender ballad that Richards also guests on, but this time only for the purpose of backup vocals and harmony. It is told from the point of view of the last leaf on a tree, after autumn took the rest. Amazing, poetic and thoughtful, it speaks of aging and getting older, and still being able to stick it out no matter what is put against you.<br /><br />Now one of the highlights of  Bad as Me is the anti-war tour-de-force \\"Hell Broke Luce\\". An entire essay could be written on this cut alone, it really is the only track Waits lets himself loose on, making toward the loud, avante garde style that his hardcore fans (I included), absolutely love. Done in an army-style march, it tells the story heard countless times, in countless wars:  a soldier goes away, experiences the horrors of war, being almost unable to cope or comprehend it all, then is brought back home, wounded and maimed, and left with no job and no future and no guidance. Very disturbing, it also may be one of the only times I've heard Mr. Waits drop the F-bomb; not once but twice- but in his defense, it is completely warranted within the context of the song.<br /><br />The last cut on the regular album is \\"New Years Eve\\", a warm nostalgic tune about a family coping with the troubles of addiction and the like, while still trying to enjoy the holidays  for what they are, and the fond memories they bring. In it's conclusion, he seamlessly interjects \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", much like he did over 30 years earlier with \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" in \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\".  The deluxe edition gives you three extra songs packaged in a nice, small, hardcovered book, which is a real treat.<br /><br />This album flows effortlessly along without any speed bumps and before the listener realizes, it is over, leaving us wanting more.  Though it is not personally my favorite Waits album, it definitely proves a number of points: It definitely is the most accessible album in his catalog in years; there is no filler on here, every track is great, which is extremely rare nowadays; Mrs. Brennan was spot on with keeping the tracks around 3 minutes each for the sake of flow, it definitely helps the album keep moving (which is not at all a dig at his other albums which have longer tunes;I think this just works here with what they were working toward); and most importantly, Bad as Me solidifies the idea that Mr. Waits is still exploring new ground and evolving.<br /><br />At 61 years young, I dare everyone to cite a contemporary who increasingly breaks new ground with each new release, and still has the quality that his work holds. While people his age, tour huge arenas, playing 'best of' shows, Mr. Waits continues to challenge himself and the music community and defies logic by being able to produce such an amazing product, that evolves with the times. (Hell, he beat-boxes for Christ's sake on tunes and it works- Brilliantly at times!) Earlier this year Mr. Waits was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in his acceptice speech, he said: \\"They say I have no hits and that I'm difficult to work with- and they say it like that's a bad thing.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't agree more.  Tom Waits is an acquired taste; much like jazz, wine or bourbon and other fine things. Consider yourself part of the 'in' crowd - now you know America's best kept secret...
B002XTXG1G|2.0|Don't worry ! Even Refn, during an interview, confessed that he didn't understand Bronson's psychology and that he put a lot of himself, of his own dark side, in the portrayal of the hero. Moments of surreal poetry alternate with raw violence here. It's interesting but, in my opinion, Bronson can't compare with [[ASIN:B0041KT3P8 Valhalla Rising]], the director's masterpiece. Already forgotten, unfortunately.

B0045ZAQSM|3.0|As we all know it, food is federative. In American movies, like in Stanley Tucci's [[ASIN:0767802535 Big Night]] for instance, culinary delights serve more as a way to abolish social classes differences or to fulfill the ever vivacious American dream. But Fatih Akin is a German, of Turkish parentage, living in Europe so he uses this theme differently and emphasizes the power of food in the fight against racism or xenophobia. Isn't the Greek Zinos' backache finally cured by a Turkish (Greece and Turkey still have a big problem to solve) physical therapist ? Enjoyable.
B005AUWY90|5.0|My kids love Cars and I love my kids so, there you go.  The movie looks great and has been watched constantly since we got it.
B000ECX0QU|4.0|A movie I considered as minor 25 years ago then after having seen it again every 5 years or so, I feel now the Hitchcock touch in every frame of Topaz and certain scenes start to linger in my memory after each showing: John Vernon as a Cuban with big blue eyes and his blond bodyguard, Karin Dor's dress and death, three Russians in Copenhagen, the lunch at Pierre's with Stafford observing Noiret's behaviour, the alternate endings. Highly recommended.
0553381695|3.0|I read the entire series. Well written but tedious,overlong descriptions. I skimmed much of the series looking for action and plot. It kept my interest enough to slog through all five books hoping for a satisfying conclusion. It finally ended in a shaggy dog ending. The final epilog was no different from any previous chapter. I was very disappointed, romantic that I am; I wanted a happy ending. No such luck. It seemed that another book was waiting to be published to finish thing off. I kept feeling that with good research, the books could have been redeeming by being actual historical fiction.

0316098329|3.0|It must be difficult to write a book told by a precocious five year old who has been raised in highly unusual and undesirable circumstances. Author Emma Donoghue does just that in her highly praised bestseller ROOM. And for the first pages she succeeds admirably. Unfortunately the book's style soon begins to seem like a gimmick and some of the character's actions unlikely or simply unbelievable.<br /><br />ROOM tells the story of a young woman known only as Ma in the book who was kidnapped by a psychopath and kept as a slave in a one hundred and forty-four square foot shed for seven years. During this time she became pregnant twice by her captor and though the first child died at birth the second child Jack survives and becomes the narrator of the story. In the first half of the book Jack and Ma are imprisoned in ROOM until Ma devices a risky escape plan that somehow succeeds. In the second half the duo adjust to life in the outside world that Jack has never known.<br /><br />Jack's five year old voice soon becomes grating rather than charming and there are several aspects of the story that simply do not seem credible to me. I know ROOM has loyal fans and the book is not without merits but in my opinion even though this is a short book it soon became a chore for me to finish. ROOM simply does not live up to the hype and attention it has received.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|This movie was a lot of fun. From the period costumes and music I enjoyed every minute. It is my favorite Marvel movie yet.
1451629184|4.0|I recently checked out A Stolen Life from my local library.  I thought the book was excellent, but I understand why some may find it too graphic or painful to read.  To me, the story was compelling, and well-written, especially given the fact that her formal education only went until, I think, the fifth grade or so, and she had only been out of captivity for about a year when the book was published. It went into much greater, GRAPHIC detail than I was expecting.  It's hard, because, on the one hand, it would be more readable and accessible to people without the graphic imagery... I'd feel more comfortable recommending it for others, for instance.  But on the other hand, as appalling and upsetting as the experiences are for ADULTS to READ about, it must have been exponentially more appalling, upsetting, degrading, painful, humiliating, and torturous for an innocent little GIRL to LIVE through...  it IS a part of her story.  It is, perhaps, the ugliest side of human experience.  Personally, I have a great deal of admiration and respect for Jaycee.  Her spirit is unconquerable; how she managed to keep a positive attitude and optimism through everything she went through, I may never understand, but I do admire.  I wish her only the best in her future endeavors, and that she and her children will be able to live rich and full lives, seeking the opportunities that THEY choose.
B004RE29WW|2.0|Well judging from some of the reviews I see the nihilists are out in full force to try and defend this turkey, that sent the \\"Alien\\" franchise into a downward spiral.  The problems start right off the bat with this movie.  An alien egg is somehow on board the Sulaco military ship with no explanation as to how it got there.  All the surviving cast from \\"Aliens\\" accept Ripley are needlessly killed off in the first 10 minutes.  Making their struggles and heroics in the last film a total waste of time.  We also go back to 1 alien running around killing everyone, which we've already seen before.  Compounded by the fact that most of the characters are a bunch of bald criminals on a prison planet, so we really have no sympathy for them when the alien starts picking them off.  There are a few things I did like about this movie.  The sets have an amazing gothic look.  Some of the camera work is very artistic and I like the idea of the alien coming out of a animal host and taking on some of its characteristics.  However! A few undigested pieces of candy in a turd doesn't change the fact that their in a turd.  If your a fan of the first two \\"Alien\\" films do yourself a favor and stop there.
0545265355|5.0|This was a great trilogy. I can empathise with the character's plight. Not often do you have a female lead character in a post apocolyptic novel. For guys...she isn't your typical girl and I think you could identify as well. Definitely on my must read list.

B0058ZPNOK|5.0|I caught this one at the local art-house theater, and really loved it. The mixed reviews here don't surprise me that much, because it is a film that is hard to get a handle on.  A couple of warnings:  The greater portion of the film is a touching, if prosaic, indie film about grieving and loss. However, all prosaicness is blown to hell with the introduction of the character Hesher, who is as about as crude and chaotic as they come. So a suburban tragedy-and-renewal storyline is punctuated by vicious stabs of stoner comedy. The odd thing is that the director and actors make it work.  It is a fair trick, if you can wrap your head around it. Just be prepared to swing between extremes in a movie that defies any easy categorization.  The second warning is that the character Hesher is crude, foul-mouthed, and blatantly offensive. If you're readily offended by gratuitous swearing, dirty talk, or dirty jokes, this character will readily offend you.   What I liked about it:  I grew up with heshers. In Southern California it's the name of a certain kind of suburban heavy metal fan, typically a stoner who listened to the harder, more violent end of the metal spectrum like Metallica, Megadeth, and Motorhead. For me, naming the character \\"Hesher\\" was like naming the captain of the football team \\"Jock.\\" On the other hand, I know exactly the kind of person Hesher was modeled upon, and Gordon-Levitt nailed it. The speech, the body-language, the sense of humor, all perfectly rendered. It is a slice of life I never expected to be so lovingly and accurately depicted on film. Usually heshers are portrayed as buffoons, like the main characters of Wayne's World. Here, all the darkness and menace, as well as the humor and bonhomie, are included.  The film never looses its heart, despite callous and chaotic assaults of Hesher on the main storyline. Likewise, Hesher never looses his edge, despite the underlying sweetness of the film as a whole. From reading the other reviews, it seems thatthis might be too much of an internal contradiction for some. I found it a very compelling success.  The script is impressively tight and well written, and the acting is wonderfully natural. The setting is Sothern California stripped of all its glamor and pretense. It is aging tract homes and strip malls, congested boulevards and construction sites. It addresses a level of dingy suburban reality that rarely seems to make it onto film. Because this was the texture of my childhood, I loved it.  Just expect a different kind of cinema with this one, a true indie, art-house experience, and I think you'll get what this gem of a film has to offer.

They are two characters who are a lot more complex than they appear to be on the surface. Alex is swoon worthy, smart, and uber sexy. Brittany is sensative, sweet, and compassionate. The love they both feel for their own families is just one of the reasons they fall for each other. The ending is emotional and gives an unexpected twist. Overall, I just loved it!

B0059XTUB8|4.0|The real Marilyn Monroe was an inch and a half taller than Michelle Williams, a significant difference when one considers that there is no way Williams could have replicated the voluptuous physicality of Monroe's presence. Yet, the young actress does something quite unexpected in capturing the essence of Monroe's wounded psyche for all its frailties and doing a convincing job of conveying the public Marilyn for all her breathy sensuality in this modest 2011 showbiz tale. Directed by British TV veteran Simon Curtis and written by Adrian Hodges, the film depicts a minor piece of motion picture lore based on the memoirs of Colin Clark, who was a lowly \\"third assistant director\\" during the production of the Ruritanian romance, [[ASIN:B00005RRJY The Prince and the Showgirl]]. The mostly forgotten 1957 movie marked Monroe's attempt at being taken seriously as an actress in a well-publicized collaboration with Sir Laurence Olivier just after she married playwright Arthur Miller.<br /><br />The story really begins with Monroe's arrival in London to start filming. Fully devoted to Lee Strasberg's school of Method acting, she constantly searches for her character's motivation even within the context of a souffl&eacute;-light drawing room comedy. With sychophantic acting coach Paula Strasberg constantly by her side, she is chronically tardy on the set keeping her distinguished British company of thespians waiting for hours. Monroe's already renowned insecurities become heightened by Olivier's abrasive impatience as not only her co-star but her director. As a witness to her undeniable aura, the young Colin becomes smitten as he is assigned to be her protector when she begins to bond with him after Miller returns to New York. This leads to a getaway visiting Windsor Castle and Eton College before a comparatively more confident Monroe returns to the set. The film is bookended by Williams' fearlessly entertaining takes on the Monroe classics, Irving Berlin's \\"Heat Wave\\" and Harold Arlen's \\"That Old Black Magic\\" (although completely out of their original context).<br /><br />Williams tackles the impossible with her empathetic performance as Monroe, and she manages it with aplomb without resorting to outright impersonation. One deliberate exception is the enchanting little dance she does as her character in the movie within the movie - she mimics Monroe perfectly in those few moments. Eddie Redmayne plays the callow Colin to the best of the screenplay's workmanlike limitations since the only hint of complexity is breaking the heart of the young costumer played in a fetching manner by an underused Emma Watson. As Olivier, Kenneth Branagh captures the ego-driven bluster and measured speech cadence of the legendary actor, but he is also underserved by Hodges' script.

Williams tackles the impossible with her empathetic performance as Monroe, and she manages it with aplomb without resorting to outright impersonation. One deliberate exception is the enchanting little dance she does as her character in the movie within the movie - she mimics Monroe perfectly in those few moments. Eddie Redmayne plays the callow Colin to the best of the screenplay's workmanlike limitations since the only hint of complexity is breaking the heart of the young costumer played in a fetching manner by an underused Emma Watson. As Olivier, Kenneth Branagh captures the ego-driven bluster and measured speech cadence of the legendary actor, but he is also underserved by Hodges' script.

B005MYEQ4U|3.0|Woody Allen's 2011 contribution to cinema has been heralded as a return to form by many critics, and for a few shining moments at the outset, it looks like it might just that as well be that way. Through a lovely montage of Parisian images by cinematographer Darius Khondji, Allen evokes the city's unabashed romanticism set to Sidney Bechet's nocturnally soulful saxophone on his composition \\"Si Tu Vois Ma Mere\\" much the same way the filmmaker captured the cosmopolitan energy of Manhattan set to Gershwin's grandiose \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\" in his [[ASIN:0792846109 1979 masterwork]]. The camera finally lands on the lead characters as they visit Claude Monet's picture-perfect gardens at Giverny. From there, Allen treads familiar territory following the adventures of Gil Pender, Allen's alter-ego, a successful but unfulfilled Hollywood screenwriter on a trip to Paris with his fianc&eacute;e Inez along with her wealthy, xenophobic parents who are funding the trip with typical bourgeoisie disdain.<br /><br />Longing to join the literary ranks of his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway, Gil, we discover, is working on his first novel much to Inez's chagrin. Enamored with the way Paris was during the 1920's, Gil soon finds himself in an alternate universe after midnight where he is rubbing elbows over martinis at jazz clubs with not only Fitzgerald and Hemingway but also influential figures like Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter, and Salvador Dali. By the light of day, however, he faces the mundane reality of Inez and her family, who are completely indifferent to his flights of fancy. Matters get worse when Gil and Inez bump into Paul, an old college crush of hers, who has since become the type of intolerable pedant Allen skewered so well in the movie theater scene in [[ASIN:6304907729 Annie Hall]]. Gil - as he toggles between present-day Paris and his idealized vision of the city's past - will likely remind Allen's fans of the shenanigans that occurred in \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover. Allen obviously enjoys regaling in Jazz Age-era Paris and presumes his viewers will have more than a passing familiarity with the period.<br /><br />When I saw the Steins Collect at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art this past summer, I received an in-depth primer on some of these seminal figures. You can tell Allen is less interested in the contemporary scenes, which are not as arresting with these characters coming across more like stereotypes despite a game cast. As the hapless Gil, Owen Wilson is a bit improbable as a writer with high literary aspirations, but his sincerity in the role helps win us over. Back in [[ASIN:B0002IQJ8W Mean Girls]] mode, Rachel McAdams isn't given that much to do as Inez except to express constant frustration. Usually playing sincere historical figures like Tony Blair and David Frost, Michael Sheen has a field day as the entirely unlikeable Paul. There's a predictably no-nonsense turn by Kathy Bates as Stein and an over-the-top one by Adrian Brody as Dali. As Scott and Zelda, Tom Hiddleston (the malevolent Loki in [[ASIN:B0034G4P80 Thor]]) and especially Alison Pill play their archetypes quite well, but among the real-life figures, Corey Stoll stands out as the pugnacious Hemingway. As Adriana, Marion Cotillard makes the most of her fantasy figure role. All in all, this is solid work from Allen but still a fair distance from his most accomplished.f Cairo\\" down to the introduction of an out-of-sync love interest, this time a beautiful clothing designer named Adriana, who was Modigliani's mistress and has now become Picasso's embattled lover.

0307891372|4.0|I got the books for Morrowind and Oblivion when those came out, and this one takes the cake. At 650 pages it is exhaustive. The production quality is high and the illustration is rich and detailed. I haven't needed to use the fold-out map poster often, since the in-game map is excellent, but it's gorgeous.<br /><br />My only complaint, and this is true of these guides in general, is that there is almost no advice about actual gameplay. How do finishing moves work, especially the ones for dragons? You'll just have to figure it out yourself.
0060873027|5.0|Stung by the utter ease of it, you are carried away by the lard-stocking quest of an excellent mom...no, not your beloved parent figure, but a mad-parental endoparasitoid wasp whose mission gives new meaning to bringing home the bacon (You)...yes, you're grub for the good mother's fat, slimy grub who is just about to dig in when....I won't dribble on any further to spoil the fun! Extraordinary blend of tech, hex, and tex-mex (that's the grub-din-din part)with likeable, nerdy characters forging links you'll feel compelled to follow, even if they lead into some pretty deep feces.  A tautlimbed girlpowered heroine, an irascible snarky male protag,  and various other action heroes of sink or swim pluck trying their hand at potluck in an incomprehensibly minute periphery....Fast, furiously and fetidly into that good night of a swamp teeming with monstrous vividity looming over the half-inch heroes, the story comes stock with a conscience-free evil genius (an insectoid carnivore in his own right) towering (literally) over the action.  ABSORBING (like the spider sucking up his meal...oops!) storyline enlivens this tour de force pageturner not to be put down in any way.  Be careful what you step on, because it might be a friend.  With new insight into and respect for Mother Nature (who is more of a kick-butt, vicious mutha), I think I may open up a roach motel...never know who might wander in, on the run from the hunting bugs!

B005HJWWW8|5.0|After doing some basic research on headphone amps, I decided I wanted something modern, small, and with a great value-to-price ratio. Before this even had any reviews I knew the E6 looked like a great choice. Having never owned a headphone amp before, it took me a while to get used to it. It's really simple actually.<br /><br />There are volume controls one one side, and a switch on the other.<br />When you hold the switch for a few seconds, this turns the amp on. It should have a blue light on in the corner. There's another hole on the back that has a light as well. This shows you what equalizer is selected. I usually don't use the equalizer, but instead just use the flat default settings (no light). Hold the switch for a few seconds again to turn it off. A red light in the corner means the amp is charging.<br /><br />The E6 comes with 3 cables. Two 3.5mm cables (one being a right angle cable) and a usb charging cable.<br /><br />Do you need this amp? That depends on how much you value sound quality. If you don't mind 128kbps mp3s though your stock iPod earbuds you definitely wouldn't notice the difference. However, if you consider yourself somewhat of a \\"power-user\\" (As I consider myself) or even an audiophile, then I'd recommend picking up an amp...especially if you listen at loud volumes like me. (It's bad for your ears, I know)<br /><br />The build quality itself is great. This thing is super light. It feels like plastic, but isn't bendy or anything. The glossiness looks nice but attracts fingerprints. Battery life is great also, and seems to average around 7-10 hours for me.<br /><br />My only issue with the E6 is when plugged into certain power sources I get feedback while listening. This isn't normally a problem though, as I normally don't listen to music while charging. This might not even be the E6's fault. I'm not audio engineer, I'm just in it for the great sound quality.<br /><br />I use this bad boy with my pair of foam-modded Sennheiser HD 555s and now Sennheiser HD 280s. If you need headphone recommendations I'd recommend checking the head-fi forums. Those guys know much more then I ever will.

B00475BUVM|3.0|The first version of Clash of the Titans didn't register much on the films to remember meter other than the fine cast; Sir Lawrence Oliver and Sussanah York,  wasn't supported by much of a plot, and frankly this one didn't either; however it is better in the sense of better special effects and the the 3D was superb. I bought this 3D Blu Ray to simply check out my new LG 55 inch 3D TV. It didn't disappoint in that respect. This film also has a fine cast, Sam Worthington, Liam Neissen, and Ralph Fiennes. There were a few tweaks to the plot which did make this film better than the original. I will watch it again, though not right away.

B00368PSN2|4.0|Frankly, I was surprised that this film got an R rating, even though there was a lot of violence which is not unusual for this type of action film.  Jim Caveziel's blue eyes were the star of the show, most evident in the closeups; tearing up when he gets emotional. This role is quite a departure from his one as Jesus,  in Passion of the Christ from which he was being punished by the Hollywood left in denying him really good roles. This one was filmed in Eastern Europe. This film is two hours of entertainment and is indicative of the versatility of this fine, handsome and manyly  actor. He's also great in A Person of Interest on CBS.
B003UESJEW|3.0|This film tackles the current economic situation which in part has been caused by the \\"company men\\" we see portrayed in this film.  Usually the movies castigate the people who make the decisions (for the stockholders of course), but the people affected are the workers or the people well down the company hierarchy.  The reality is that many of the white collar workers are equally affected.  This movie addresses 3 men who are fired including one of the company's founders (Tommy Lee Jones).  Ben Affleck is Bobby Walker a 37 year old, $120K a year sales manager who struggles to find work in today's economy.  The third man is a 60 year old head of a division who started in the factory.  He is played by the great Chris Cooper.  The movie isn't groundbreaking but does a good job with the twist noted above.  I also can't understand how a $160K (all in) worker can live in an exclusive Boston neighborhood; including a wife (not working) and 2 kids, a Porsche and a Volvo and a golf club membership can survive.  A very good, not great film.
B0042U94UQ|2.0|Got the dvd for my girlfriend's birthday and it worked fine until 30 minutes into it and it started skipping from there all the way to the end of movie. It was very frustrating considering the product info stated that it was in great shape. Not buying from this sender again.
B005BDZN62|5.0|For me this is the best musical ever.  So let's get that out of the way.  I've seen it many times in both film and live versions.  My last film viewing was in 2007.  With the recent Blu ray release, I thought I'd give it another look.  My first reaction was to buy the disc, but several reviewers noted that the transfer to Blu ray wasn't very good so I rented it to give it a look.  As you might expect, there is a noticeable improvement to the clarity of the film.  It retains a somewhat grainy appearance as it should.  One of the risks of Blu ray transfers is that often the film trickery is less tricky.  For example, the sets appear to be sets not scenes shot on a street.  In one scene I swear I can see Tony (Richard Beymer) reading cue cards while he sings \\"Tonight\\" with Maria (Natalie Wood).  In the scene where Tony meets Maria for the first time at the dance, colorful snow-like lights drop from the ceiling.  In the standard DVD this appears to be mystical or magical.  In the Blu ray this looks, well fake.  The other thing that is very noticeable is the opening scene when the music and sketched city skyline dissolves into an overhead shot of NYC.  You can see the film shimmering and fluttering.  How much of this matters will depend on the viewer.  For me my DVD version still looks pretty good on an up-converted Blu ray player although the 5.1 surround is no match for uncompressed HD-DTS.<br /><br />Looking at an all time favorite movie with a more critical eye is hard for me to do sometimes but I tried.  Clearly the weakest component is Beymer's characterization of Tony.  Tony was once a leader of the Jets.  A tough guy, a hoodlum.  Beymer's version makes that hard to believe.  I guess Beymer was more concerned about his leading man persona than that of a tough guy who can also sing.  Russ Tamblyn as Riff and George Chakiris as Bernardo pull it off.  Natalie Wood is certainly acceptable as Maria in spite of her lack of Hispanic roots.  She comes across as sweet and innocent and is a fair dancer.  She of course doesn't do her own singing.  Rita Mareno is deserving of her Oscar as Anita, the rough on the surface girlfriend of Bernardo.  Check out her scene at Doc's when she is abused and nearly raped by the Jets.  All of this is of little importance because the overall structure of the Romeo and Juliet adaptation (save the ending), the Bernstein/Sondheim score and Jerome Robbins brilliant choreography overcome these quibbles.  \\"West Side Story\\" remains a cinematic masterpiece.innocent and is a fair dancer.

The timing of the release of the book made reading it a little sad, and it does give what I think is a honest look at Steve Jobs. It seems he often was a very unhappy and intense person.   Definitely worth reading. At over 500 pages, it seems to be a substantial and initially, though it was overdone, but it's a swift read, very insightful and  worthy of the length and detail.

B003QNXPUK|3.0|I bought two Zaggs for two iPhone 4S. Installation was not simple. First one, I finally got it on straight, but put in a couple of scratches just rubbing out the bubbles, but it was still usable and not too bad looking. On the second phone, no scratches, but could never get the Invisible Shield to stick completely at the edge, where the rubber case fit over it, so there was an unremovable narrow bubble along the edge.  Also, the InvisibleSHIELD is not really invisible. There is a definite texture to it when you're looking at the screen at an angle.  I wasn't happy with the ZAGG results, so ordered the Power Support Crystal Film set. It was much easier to install. There are good installation videos on their website. They even show you how to remove dirt specks from underneath if necessary, and I did have to do that. Bubbles were easy to remove. Once installed, you could hardly tell there was a film there. Beautiful on both iPhone 4S.

B00005JKLZ|5.0|This remake of the original 1960s version was a fantastic one!!!  Loved the many different people of varying backgrounds, the special effects, the script, the actors and actreses.  It refelcts more reality than the original which created an environment that \\"people of color\\" never existed.  This is not reality and regretfully Hollywood has done this since its existence.  Or, people of color were always shown in an extremely bad light; there was an unhealthy imbalance of good and evil.  There is a total disregard of the many essential contributions made by people of color.  You can and must not continually deny these contributions to this society and these old films consistently did that.  The 1960s Time Machine did not represent a true picture of the world.  In that version everyone came from one ethnic background and this is totally unfair to the many different peoples of the world.  Whenever there were important inventions, discoveries, etc. there was always people of color contributing but their contributions were removed or stolen. People, read your history not the edited versions!<br /><br />The (revised) Time Machine was and is a great movie along with 2012 (Director: Roland Emmerich; Writers: Roland Emmerich, Harald Kloser.  Stars: John Cusack, Thandie Newton and Chiwetel Ejiofor is extremely inclusive (and I must say a few other films) of all nationalities and this we should all be proud. Had to include additional information of the 2012 because there was another 2012 which was intentionally non inclusive and had only one ethnic group involved; again, removing all people of color.  I was so taken aback that I didn't watch the entire movie.  The acting was cheesy, unbelievable, and completely clumsy in its presentation as well.<br /><br />Castatrophic events of the world naturally involve all people of color in every aspect of life which include scientists, inventors, etc.  It has been proven over and over again and again that one ethnic group does not have all the answers but that when we work together we can accomplish what is needed.<br /><br />Attempts to hold other groups down prevent the dominant group from rising.  In all aspects of life the world would have been much farther along if the dominant group had not held people of color down.  WORK TOGETHER PEOPLE and we all rise together.
B005C7SXMS|3.0|Submarine is a witty, occasionally sardonic, film shot in a distinctly Wes Anderson-like style, about Oliver (Craig Roberts) a quirky young man coming of age as he deals with his first love and his parents' deteriorating marriage. The film, written and directed by Richard Ayoade and executive produced by Ben Stiller, follows Oliver as he navigates tricky emotional waters both at home and in school: His girlfriend's mother is dying and the sheer terror of it is often too much for him to handle, leaving him less responsive and supportive than his girlfriend would like. Simultaneously, Oliver tries to sabotage what he perceives as a burgeoning affair between his mother and a wildly narcissistic self-help guru next door (a hilarious supporting performance by Paddy Considine).<br /><br />It sounds like unbearably intense material, but the narrative style is a dry, deadpan one that keeps the tone light and occasionally makes one laugh out loud. I mentioned that the style is pure Wes Anderson and viewers of Anderson's work can probably guess what that means: strong, very graphic, visuals and compositions; prolonged set pieces set to popular music; deadpan delivery; offbeat humor; and heavy use of narration.<br /><br />As in Anderson's work, you see here a director very much in command of his material. The film is visually beautiful and expressive; it's at all times witty and entertaining, and occasionally very funny; and the performances are all excellent (Sally Hawkins plays Oliver's mother and is wonderful as usual). What it lacks, however, is a strong emotional core that leaves one truly moved as well as entertained. It is a weakness shared by Wes Anderson's lesser works, but overcome in his best (The Royal Tanenbaums). What I mean is that, to a remarkable degree given what the characters are going through, we don't care about them all that much: both central relationships (Oliver and his girlfriend, Oliver's parents) could rot and one doesn't get the sense that the characters would be worse off. There's a vulnerability that's missing in these characters to make them feel more relatable and human. It's the risk that comes with having a story that is so strongly stylized -- and no amount of wit and charm can mitigate it. What would have, I think, taken the film to another emotional level, would have been a sublime moment or two written into the script and delivered with heart: I'm thinking of the moment in The Royal Tanenbaums when the off-the-wall eccentric character played by Ben Stiller confesses to his father \\"it's been a very tough year dad\\" and suddenly all of his strangeness takes on a new dimension and we're seeing a scared, lonely human being in all his complexity. It's moments like that which reveal the heart beneath all the craziness and make a truly indelible story out of what could otherwise have been just an exercise in style.<br /><br />I wouldn't say Submarine is just an exercise in style - there is material here that resonates and the central metaphor (of which the title is a part) is a compelling one - but if there were moments that truly moved, they eluded me. Still, it is a very solid piece of filmmaking and a thoroughly entertaining way to spend an hour and a half.be worse off.

I think that is part of the scary charm of the show, you kind of have to love the bad guys, because they are just as angry and confused as any damsel in distress.   It's like a complex puzzle that just keeps getting more vague and also clearer with time.seems like a paradox, but when the line between life and death is so blurred that you cant tell a hawk from a handsaw, or a psychopath from your own darling husband, it doesnt seem so strange, does it?..can't wait for the next episode!
B0019N94X6|4.0|Story:  I just finished watching this on BD and I was shocked at what I had seen upon what must be my 500th viewing!  What Scarface first came out, I was about 11 years old.  In my mind I did not seem that young, but when I did the math I was.<br /><br />I saw the film on cable all those years ago and I enjoyed it.  I like the hard-core gritty feel of the film - yes, even at the age of 11!  When I saw it then, I knew it was about a Cuban immigrant who lied about who he was in order to get into the US.  I knew that he was looking for a come up and drug dealing was the way.  He gets into the drug scene and like any other narcissist, he thinks that he can do it better than anyone who is already doing and of course he wants all of the credit and all of the fame.  He wants his bosses money, respect, white woman, drugs, direct connection - everything!<br /><br />Once Tony Montana climbs the ladder, it is not enough for him to make it, he then shows (like every narcissist) that he cannot cooperate with people and he has a hard time recognizing that other people are above him.  After a while, he starts playing into the REAL field of drugs distribution.  He gives these people his word that he would never cross them and they take revenge.<br />Until I just finished watching it now, I used to think that this film was about drug dealing and the flashy lifestyle.  After watching I realized it was not really about that! This movie was really about exposing those who control the drug trade as a corporation.  They dropped hints like transporting the drugs up to Panama, but the US patrols that.  We all know what happened to Noriega!  There was also the bank money laundering and the bank manager's keen knowledge of playing the game of money laundering and shaking Montana down.<br /><br />Once Tony starts making tens of millions, he becomes a major player.  He then get's the attention of all of the power brokers who are controlled by the elite's (US government/bankers/corporations) enablers.  They ask him to knock off a big time critic of the international drug trade.  To persuade Montana into doing the hit, they first set him up with the money laundering scheme and tax evasion.  Once he is in the presence of the elite's enablers, Tony is introduced to a US representative who can make Tony's jail time go away - THAT is the tradeoff.<br /><br />Tony was being tested.  They wanted to see if he could be in with the REALLY big boys.  This is why they set him up and this is the only reason why they ask HIM to do the hit instead of any other group.  Once he would have finished the hit, he would have been admitted into a world of political shenanigans of the type that makes the news!  You know, \\"terrorism,\\" assassinations, ritual murders, child rape and the usual stuff that is controlled by the elites in the US and elsewhere that we think are just low-level, non-government people.<br /><br />Tony did not have an education, as was noted earlier in the film.  This is why he could not see what he was getting himself into.  Sosa and Frank warned him many times to be calm and calculating, not unpredictable.  If you noticed, Frank and Sosa were well dressed, well-spoken and uppity, while Tony came from the \\"gutter.\\"  They, especially Sosa were aware of the forces that make the drug trade possible.  These forces (the US) make it possible for drugs to be available from coast to coast.  Outside forces cannot do this.<br />Tony failed to carry out the hit so the powers that be had to replace Tony and build up another kingpin to be tested to see if he \\"fits in.\\"  One thing of note, Sosa made mention of the bomb underneath the car when Tony said that they could try again.  He said that they guy would have very tight security now.  It reminds me of the JFK assassination.  If JFK had not been killed that day but simply wounded, he would have had very tight security and someone would have to of been caught and exposed in that attempt.  This film is very telling.<br />So this film is not really about drug dealing but how the elites control and run the drug game. After watching Scarface, you should now know why drug dealers, no matter how deep in the game, are always expendable.<br /><br />Video: The video on this BD is top notch for this film.  This film always had a lot of grain so I was curious to find out how they would work it out.  They did a pretty good job.  It was very sharp but still grainy and there were more details than any previous version.  This may be as good as it gets until a medium that can hold more time at higher bit rates becomes available.  The bit rate on this hovered around 13 mbps.<br /><br />Audio: The audio was very good.  It had great surround effects as if it were just released.  It was clear, but the only problem was that the main dialog did not match the resolution of the effects.  I guess there was but so much they could do with it.  The rear surrounds were a lot louder that the other spears.  This could be due to the fact that the disc is 7.1 and my setup is 5.1.<br /><br />Package: The steel case was cool.  I really do not care for steel case or cards or any other accessories.  I just want the film in it's best presentation.  I can tolerate steel cases though.  I bought mine on sale, and then the next day it went down!  I then wanted the difference, and then as I looked into a little more, I realized that I was not supposed to get the steel case, but the plastic one!  I guess I lucked out!tes control and run the drug game. After watching Scarface, you should now know why drug dealers, no matter how deep in the game, are always expendable.

B005KELW26|3.0|Maybe as time goes by, better covers will be available for the Kindle Fire.  This one is thin and has no padding to speak of, so its protective qualities are limited, and it doesn't feel like real leather.  My old Kindle has a cover made by M Edge which is much nicer.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|This is an instant classic that won my heart in the first few minutes. In these modern times its rare to find a film that will appeal to both kids and parents but here it is. Loveable characters, good plot and keeps everyones interest through out. This will become part of our video library for sure!!!

B005HPY8LU|5.0|Excellent cd, powerful vocals, Kelly Clarkson rocks it as usual. The CD was well worth the preorder! The cd arrived on time, and I always listen to it with the kids. I so appreciate a singer that doesn't have to curse every third word, that has actual talent, and that loves what she does. It all shows in this cd.
0307454541|4.0|This book was interesting enough that it kept my attention but not so much plot driven that I finished it in one sitting.  I enjoyed savoring this novel and getting to know all the characters.  By the end I couldn't wait to read _The Girl Who Played With Fire_.

B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I purchased this application for the Kindle Fire based on the user documentation that stated the app could access files stored on Google Docs.

1451648537|4.0|I bought the Steve Jobs biography because I have been an apple user since I purchased the first apple II many years ago and when I moved recently I found a Lisa in my basement. The topic is interesting and brings back many memories. The book itself, although detailed and informative, sometimes is simply a bit too long, meandering between less important and completely irrelevant details. Possibly, others find highly interesting what I consider boring, though.  It's not a must read but it offers very interesting details into the reasoning and the strategy of apple.

When my son was in first grade he came home and told me his teacher read the nicest story to the class and it really made a strong impression on him. We bought the book and it has become a family tradition to gift-give this book to anyone starting a family. It is touching and heart warming and lifes lesson on what unconditional true family love is all about. Even though my children are now grown, I never fail to still tell them that I 'Love them forever\\"....
B000TQAKU0|5.0|This was the album that good old Uncle Frank recorded (along with its close sibling \\"Waka/Jawaka\\") while he was confined to a wheelchair after being thrown off stage by a crazed fan. The results were phenomenal. After shedding ex-Turtles members Flo and Eddie, Zappa wrote a wealth of music, most of which was in the more jazz vein. The opening cut doesn't tell us much about the new direction (that goofy, yet utterly brilliant number \\"For Calvin (And his next two hitch Hikers\\"), however, the rest of the record is big band jazz like only Zappa could do. Highly recommended for jazz fans or MOI fans who couldn't stomach the Flo and Eddie era.
B0052GACNM|4.0|Lady Gaga is perfectly cast as the \\"tramp\\" in the first number- very sassy and sexy! And again... Amy Winehouse was the perfect artist to interpret Billie Holiday's Body & Soul. She \\"channeled\\" Holiday's pain, angst and sound although, in hindsight, it was not much of a stretch. Winehouse was battling her own demons when this duet was recorded. Michael Buble' is the apple that didn't fall too far from the tree. He and Bennett are carbon copies of one another. Very \\"rat pack\\" of them. The duet with k.d. lang is a study in perfectly smooth harmonies. This is not surprising as these two have worked together in the past producing an album together. Great harmonies for the evening. I have always loved Sheryl Crow because of her ability to be all things to all people and maintain her distinctive sound. She crosses genres very gracefully. I've never been a big fan of Norah Jones. When I saw her live performance she seemed emotionally detached from the body of her music and very cold and aloof. Oddly, her performance on this CD is warm and inviting. I suspect some southern hospitality and charm. Her voice has that southern twang. Bennett is perfectly matched with Natalie Cole. Cole is another favorite of mine. She knows the entire jazz songbook by heart and it shows. Both of their impeccable jazz chops shine on this duet. Faith Hill's voice reminds me of the great Ella Fitzgerald's voice... perfect pitch! Bet this is the first time she's been compared to Ella! Faith has been on hiatus for six years but can still come back strong, singing anything she chooses. Josh Groban's appearance is misplaced. His voice is so huge that he overwhelms anyone he is partnered with. Bennett is not his equal nor is anyone else. He always sings as if he is making love with the listener. He always makes his audience feel special. Love Josh Groban. The duet with Bocelli was a little strained as I felt Andrea was holding back so Bennett could keep up. Bennett was certainly over powered by his beautiful and towering voice. Never heard of Alejandro Sanz. The Latin tinge was a nice twist to add a little \\"spice\\". The solo by the great Cuban trumpeter Arturo Sandoval was also a nice touch. The surprise on the album for me was Queen Latifah. Her voice is strong and she knows her jazz phrasing. I will definitely be checking out more of her music in the future. I would have liked to hear more Mariah Carey. She has a strong soulful gospel voice that I could listen to forever. There is one GREAT performance on this CD- Aretha Franklin brings perfect timing, phrasing and passion to every performance she has ever done. Her breath control is amazing in light of the fact that she is not in the best of health. She turns every performance into a soulful Gospel! As with Josh Groban's duet, she also overshadows Bennett and is rapturous. No surprise.  Now for the three duets that were less than successful. John Mayer just wasn't given enough \\"air time\\" on this duet. It felt like Bennett was pushing him throughout their number. Willie Nelson? Ugh! [no words can describe how awful] ...Although his guitar solo was refreshing. Carrie Underwood's  \\"little girl\\" demeanor and voice really turns me off. I'm not a fan. Skip these three numbers and enjoy the remainder of the CD.beautiful and towering voice. Never heard of Alejandro Sanz. The Latin tinge was a nice twist to add a little \\"spice\\".

B0019N8P2W|5.0|LOVE this show. Everyone else has already summed up the show and the makeup of the DVD package fine, but I just wanted to say that I haven't seen the show in a very long time, so I did not even notice that the music was different. The show is still great!
B005C9W9WQ|5.0|I didn't think that Kasabian could get any better. Their no nonsense music style is genius. This isn't pop rock that hits the charts as singles, but their success in the industry and per album tells you that they are doing things right. This album is no exception, as they simply continue to produce music that is true to the artists vision instead of trying to hit the Top 40. I specifically like the way that Kasabian uses the human voice as an instrument and not just for lyrics. Most songs have to be absobed by listening a couple of times to \\"get it\\", but after you do that, you will most likely listen to them hundreds of times afterwards. Music is very subjective of course, but I believe that there aren't any better acts in today's music scene than that of Kasabian.
B005V20JKI|2.0|The game looks fun but i tried it twice and twice it froze my Verizon Fascinate.  I had to pull the battery last time.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  It's rare to buy a CD and like every single song, but that is the case for me with this one.  There might be one or two songs that aren't as strong as the others, but it's still outstanding.  I've been listening to the entire thing on the train to and from work and it relaxes yet inspires me every time.  Florence's voice is strong and sure on every track, and almost haunting in some.  The background music is so beautiful in some of the songs that it makes me feel emotional.  Sometimes a song will start out slow and then suddenly there is Florence's powerful voice and so many different types of instruments being played in the background and you're just carried away by the beauty.  My favorites are \\"No Light No Light\\", \\"All This and Heaven Too\\", and \\"Strangeness and Charm.\\"  Simply an excellent album.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|This was well adapted from the Book.  Unfortunately JK Rowling's books are so long and beautifully conceived you could almost make it into 3 parts instead of 2.  Whoever adapted it, picked the essentials, with out lossing anything that was really important.  I can't wait to see the Deathly Hallows Part 2.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|GREAT MOVIE, AND SOUNDTRACK.  I NEVER REALLY LIKED GWENYTH PALTROU'S MOVIES.  SHE ALWAYS CAME ACROSS AS A MAMA'S GIRL.  THIS MOVIE AND SOUNDTRACT MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND.  LOVE HER VOICE.
B005PTQPU0|5.0|I loved Kate Bush when I was 10 years old when I saw her amazing video for \\"Cloudbusting\\". Then year after year I was getting deeper and deeper in Kate's world and I have become fan of her amazing creation.<br />We get now, 6 years after \\"Aerial\\", new album. Did I expect that? Did I hope for that kind of music? No and no. Because with Kate you never know what she will give you. Of course you can always find \\"typical\\" Kate sound but every album is unique. And every album builds different story.<br />In case of \\"50 Words For Snow\\" I loved it since a very first piano sounds. It's a very acoustic album. Basically most of the time it's just Kate and her piano. She has amazing voice that gives you shivers. Again, you can't really compare this album to any of her previous releases. Entire album is very original and its mood is very melancholic. Songs are very mellow but in good meaning of this word. Someone could have problem to imagine what can be interesting in 13 minutes song when you can only hear Kate Bush' voice and her piano but you just can't find words to describe and explain that it's pure beauty. All lyrics are very deep and personal. Especially \\"Snowed In At Wheeler Street\\"  that is one of the biggest surprises in my life. It brings Kate Bush in duet with Elton John. I was never fan of his work and voice but what I hear in \\"Snowed In At Wheeler Street\\" is one of the most beautiful and emotional songs I have ever heard in my life. It's a song about forever love, and two friends who are together and in love since ages and meet in each life since thousand years and they are scared to be separated again.<br />It's impossible to find weak song on \\"50 Words For Snow\\". I don't think there is one on this album. Definitely my favourites are: \\"Misty\\", \\"Snowed In At Wheeler Street\\" and \\"Among Angels\\" but entire album is like wonderful book when you just can't choose the best chapter as the whole story is a perfection. And it's like in case of wonderful book after very last words of last chapter you need to open it again and start to read that story again, here you start to listen \\"50 Words For Snow\\" again. Kate is back.f last chapter you need to open it again and start to read that story again, here you start to listen \\"50 Words For Snow\\" again. Kate is back.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Excellent game, very similar in style to Sid Meyer's Pirates except more text-based.  The learning curve is very steep.  If you are willing to put in the energy to learn the mechanics and maybe read the manual, this game will prove to be very rewarding with its level of depth and attention to detail.  Five stars.

It's fun and funny but dwells on the pointlessness of material wealth, religion, government, yes ... and love!!! A new religion in a banana republic, a scatterbrained scientist with a weird family, the world's most beautiful woman and some deadly science all mix together to make a ripping yarn. Busy Busy Busy ... I've read it a dozen times over the years and I'm still hooked and still a devout Bokononist. Thanks Kurt.[[ASIN:038533348X Cat's Cradle: A Novel]]
B000EQ47GS|5.0|A classic !! I'll admit it when it first came out I hated it ! It sounded way too polished with too many electronic toys supplementing it. Besides I was into ACDC , Scorpions etc and it just didnt fit. However after a short time period and being more or less forced to listen to it I had to acknowledge the fact that it was one hell of a album. This was one talented bunch of guys in every department. More Than A Feeling is my favorite and although I dont listen to the radio very often when I do and this song comes on it makes me happy for some reason maybe its the hand clapping. I dont know what happened with this band but this is the only album they did that I want in my collection. They just could never come up with anything else close to this one.

Now I can listen to this amazing concert just by turning on my cd player!  The music of Howard Shore, combined with the expertise of conductor Ludwig Wicki, and the 21st Century Symphony Orchestra, is heavenly music to my ears!
B005P78VK4|3.0|Immortal has many new, surprising elements to be sure.  Best thing is to keep in mind that it is not a  MJ production.  It may be considered a tribute. It could be an interpretation of MJ's work against a contemporary backdrop. Hear the entire Immortal on the NPR website (added this on 11/27/11).<br /><br />Working Day & Night sounds like the LIVE (In Concert) version.  Fast beat and lively for those of you (if any) who never saw this performed live.<br /><br />Immoral Introduction - just a musical time capsule that travels backward in time.<br /><br />Childhood - MJ's voice, taken from Heal The World, introduces the original version.<br />The song pauses and MJ speaks about creating music as an instrument of nature.<br /><br />Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' - This is a remake that takes highlights of the original version to create a contemporary sound.  I like the untouchable words to the original song, but this version is listenable.<br /><br />Dancing Machine/Blame It On The Boogie - Caution is advised:  this is a heavily edited version.<br />Was it created for the clubs?<br /><br />This Place Hotel - An unexpected addition with a part of Smooth Criminal tagged onto the end.  It's a creative attempt at something and somewhat awkward--I don't know whether MJ would've connected the two together.  But the next song is Smooth Criminal.<br /><br />Smooth Criminal - an edited version.  Takes the genius of the original song and the short film and works them together.<br /><br />Dangerous - blends Dangerous with words from In The Closet.  Is it a shallow attempt to tie these two ideas together?  I had to listen to it twice to adjust, but I guess it passes.<br /><br />The Jackson 5 Melody - Good job of sequencing Jackson 5 fan favorites, which is easy to do and probably not really new.<br /><br />Speechless/Human Nature - Reminds me of something in This Is It (DVD).  Human Nature, one of my favorite songs, is shortened.  That's disappointing when you like the words to a song and the way the singer sings a song.<br /><br />It's Scary/Threatened - This is a really good, seamless blend of similar subject matter.<br /><br />Thriller - A remake and quite good as the new intro picks up on the beat of Thriller.  Uses the good stuff--special effects and voice--from the original.  I could visualize MJ using this version in a performance other than a concert.<br /><br />You're Not Alone/Just Can't Stop Loving You - Seems like two different ideas but it sort of works if you keep in mind MJ did not create this.  Don't know the reason for the creators using parts of the Spanish version of the second song.  It's an odd decision to do so although it sounds okay.  Actually, the use of Remember The Time links three different ideas and further confuses.<br /><br />Beat It/State of Shock - I like the use of the Bad short film interjected into this blend.<br /><br />Jam - A new version.  I think the majority will like it.  The creators began with a good, solid song to begin with and that's MJ's genius.<br /><br />Planet Earth/Earth Song - This is a clever link to MJ's love for the only planet known to have life --our planet.  If we harm our planet, we have no where to go.  Earth Song was one of MJ's last (rehearsed) songs.  He seemed to care about this song and clearly took its message to heart.<br /><br />They Don't Care About Us - There are a number of versions of this song by MJ so I can't tell whether this is a MJ creation or one created posthumous.<br /><br />I'll Be There - Young MJ sings this one.  Sounds like a little boy angel saying he'll always be here . . . .<br /><br />Immortal Megamax - Can You Feel It/Can't Stop Till You Get Enough/Billie Jean/Black & White - This is very upbeat sequence.  I know MJ will be doing the moonwalk any minute.<br />Interestingly, the first and last songs have us thinking about brotherhood and equality.  And then the album ends with the ultimate message promoting change in humanity.<br /><br />Man In The Mirror  -This seems to be an original version.  This is another favorite MJ song of mine and one he will be well-remembered for by fans who know that MJ was the King of Hearts.
B004IFYN2Y|5.0|Based on actual events a true SPY thriller filled with deceit. The actors were good the photography was good. The story was gripping.  The Bush administration from the first days in office were looking for an excuse to go to war with Iraq. They pushed their lies to get the US into a war we had no reason to fight. Results it put the US deeper into debt. Cost thousands of American lives and millions of Iraqi lives.  The lesson needs to be learned because the neocons are beating the same drum of war for Iran now.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|I've always trusted Amazon to do the right choice for me. Not anymore. When choosing this movie, I could have selected the blu-ray only format, and that would have been ok. I chose the blu-ray + dvd + digital copy instead. Now I realize this digital copy is unusable for me, I won't be able to put in in my carefully built iTunes library, contrary to what I've done with all my previous purchases... Now I realize I'll have to be careful when choosing digital copies, as now there are more options that I don't really care about. Yes, I know I should be the one doing the research before buying, but it is a case of innocence lost. Stay away from this Ultraviolet digital version.
B002VRZEYM|2.0|Food, Inc. gets two starts because it was an entertaining yarn.  However, it presents a small fraction the information needed to give the viewer a complete picture of an enormous industry.  It doesn't even make any apologies for it.  Worse yet, what is presented as fact is most often opinion.<br /><br />I don't know when it became commonplace for documentaries to be so one-sided, but the trend has ruined the genre for me.  I assume it started with Michael Moore, but who really cares.  Not a single time in this show did the director have anyone present a dissenting opinion.<br /><br />Unless you are just looking for some material to support your opinion that the food industry is the embodiment of evil (with the exception of small organic farmers who are akin to saints), I would pass on this if I were you.
0553801473|5.0|These low ratings are ridiculous.  The book is a little slow in the beginning, but it picks up before half way and is just as good as the other books after that.  Book 1 was the same way, slow at first, then picking up.  People are just mad because the stories aren't resolved and the book took too long to come out.  But it is NOT a bad book.  I really enjoyed it and wasn't disappointed at all.  It may not be my favorite of the series, but it does belong in the series.  This is not like what happened with Robert Jordan's books, which became unreadable after a while.  Don't be afraid to buy this book - if you love this series, then you will enjoy it.
B005G4YEF2|5.0|I can add nothing to the superb reviews of the original CD transfer - other than to reiterate this is Sherill Milnes's finest hour - a dramatic baritone who can make all tenors jealous with his amazing high notes.  Warning: the libretto is NOT included but can be downloaded only by inserting the CD in your computer CD player (and probably disabling any auto-rip software - e.g. Windows Media Player) and going to the Decca web site
B005HV6Y84|2.0|I think you should be able to take the soundtracks from all of the films and play them all on shuffle and the should work together.  This soundtrack has made that impossible.  There were some odd Artist choices on the soundtrack.  The song called \\"Neighbors\\" was bad, \\"I didn't mean it\\" too, \\"Sister Rosetta\\" is lousy and what is Bruno Mars doing on here? \\"A Thousand Years\\" was so sappy. I feel it should be all alternative as the other soundtracks were.  What happened?  Most unfortunate. This wasn't woth buying the whole thing. It feels so disconnected from the film and story.
B005NA3B8U|5.0|This is a version that mimics the original as good as MAME only with enhanced controls. At first I did not think I would like the touch screen anywhere layout but found it easier than the thumbstick corner layout.  Well worth the few quarters it costs to buy.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Books are for dreaming a bigger dream and imagining the what ifs in life. This book tells of a love that stands the test of time and then beyond. It's mysterious weaving in and out of lives that are forever changed. I sat down and read this in one afternoon.  Nicholas has in no way lost his spark.
B005I64U34|5.0|Straightforward super hero genesis movie. Good effects that look great in HD. The boys and I have fun watching it. Your standard extras. No surprises. Great buy !
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Cute app, nice way to kill some time. My kids like it too. Don't expect to much, it is kinda like boom blocks for the Wii.
B000005ALP|5.0|Great album - not a bad song in the bunch. I'm not a mega fan of the group or the genre, it is a just a peaceful, melodic ride.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My kids and I love this game. My 10 yr old beat it. It was tough, the roof top was challenging. Worth the price. Free would be better. Really fun, after you beat the game you get to play the mini games all you want.
0316133930|3.0|I'm baffled as to why this is rated lower than Eclipse, which I hated. Breaking Dawn improves on all of Eclipses blinding faults. Sure, the writing still stinks, but to all those knocking the book because of it: what were you expecting?!<br /><br />Breaking Dawn has more of a plot than the rest, even if the ending was very anti-climatic. This book felt so much different than the others in the Twilight Saga, what with Bella being a vampire and all, but her change and exploration of powers was interesting. The werewolf section in the middle dragged on waaay too long with very little pay-off in the end.<br /><br />Repetition and whining was kept to a minimum--another plus to Bella's transformation. However, I don't think Esme or Alice is capable of just walking into a room. They FLIT everywhere. I'm not quite sure how to imagine that action without them spinning around and flapping their arms like hummingbirds or fairies. Ridiculous. Still, I enjoyed this one almost as much as New Moon.
B004L07KWQ|5.0|Very nice simple app, can't choose colors to draw in but kids don't seem to mind this. Cannot accidentally erase without hitting the ok button.
B0057OOQN6|4.0|Yes,this IS one the classic Tangerine Dream albums,...and it stands as one of their best.  The sound here is very good,but has some mysterious light \\"crackle\\" audible.  It makes me wonder about the masters and if they are somehow lost. Years ago one reissue had a GIANT drop-out during the first track here(the release was on the Jive-Electro label...just so you know),...then Castle Comunications (out of England) reissued this with fabulous sound(with no crackles and very warm bass responce!).  Now here comes another reissue,......and this is the most easily found now and it has yet more slight \\"mystery\\" to it's sound and mastering. For what I think is the best sound on this album search out the Castle reissue....  But the draw-back to grabbing that version is that you will miss-out on the live disc here.  It's a pretty cool concert from very early in TD's career,....and yet there are some (obvious) troubles with this \\"live\\" recording.  The main one is that during the show ,an audience member goes into \\"overdrive\\" whistling at what they must think are the \\"high-points\\" of the music.  While I can,most times, ignore the whistling ,....well,it does get pretty annoying.  So annoying that you get to hear other audience members start to threaten him ,especially if you listen on headphones(!).  So said \\"whistler\\" gets yelled at telling him to \\"Shut the F____ up!!\\"  after a few audience members yell just to \\"Sut up!!\\" a few times before that.....so it does get to be a heated exchange.  It's not so loud in the music mix that it would be heard by children,.....but in headphones you really feel for the guy doing the threatening because the \\"whistler\\" is really being a jerk,...especially when the \\"whistler\\" just goes into a tirade of whistling (tootling and tweeting away)after the \\"shut the F up...\\" yell!  So, while it didn't bother me listening in my car as I drove,.....it DID bother me a lot in a headphone listen,...so much so that I'd probably be trying to find that \\"whistler\\"to tape his mouth shut if I was at the concert!   Just so you know the whole deal here,....in summation I'd say that I wouldn't \\"get rid\\" of this just because of that one marring factor in the live disc,.....but then again I won't get rid of my Castle records copy either because of the slight crackling in the mastering on this version of ATEM.  I mean the live \\"bonus\\" is just that, a cool bonus for those of us who never saw or heard the band in their career high-point,.....but I still prefer the old mastering over this version.  I'd listen to ether version of the main album and be happy with hearing one of the best synth classics of all time.  But use your own judgement as to what is more important to you....perfect sound or a live bonus.        PS The booklet here is fabulous and the best I've seen for this albums release.  Good listening to you!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is a very fun game I got it for my brand new tablet and I can't stop playing it!
B004289ZW0|2.0|I purchased my GNS5870MFI from Amazon in February of 2011.  It will not run on battery now; all the lights go out and the signal disappears from my iPad when I unplug the charging cable.  It still works properly when plugged in, which is not always possible in my application.  While the unit has a 24 month warranty the battery is only warranted for 6 months.  I've submitted a support request to the manufacturer, GNS GmbH, and am awaiting word as to the cost of battery replacement or other options they may offer. (The unit is sealed and it appears the battery is not user-replaceable.  I also experienced the switch frustrations described by many other users.    I also had to reset the unit (paper clip through tiny hole) many times to get it to connect/reconnect to the iPad.  Sometimes it loses its connection to the iPad while in use. (they're never more than 3' apart)  All this combines to make reliability an issue.
B00005JM20|5.0|The response was quick and the delivery was also quick.  It was packaged carefully.I had no problems at all.  This was a movie that I had to purchase for my collection   of Mr.Bean.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|This album has a genuine blues feel about it.  Assembling a great band that includes Doyle Bramhall 11 and album producer T Bone Burnett, Gregg Allman delivers on what is probably his best solo effort to date.  His voice has acquired that gravelly tone that sits so well with the style of music on this album. Highlights include the opening track 'Floating Bridge' (compare this version to Clapton's on 'Another Ticket'), 'Just Another Rider' and 'Devil Got My Woman'. An excellent addition to any blues collection.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I loved this game but it was too short. if it had more levels it would be perfect and I would give it 5 stars.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|This show was great, now I come from a comics background and at first when I saw the name the Losers, I thought this would end up being a war movie, because DC comics original Losers were military in WWII but that shows how out of touch with the comic I have been.  So not having the background with the comic this is based off of, I can say this was an excellent film alongside the equally excellent movie that came out around the same time, the Expendables.  Both have comedy, action, great stars, all wrapped up in a fatastic story.  A military hero team like no other, definately worth watching, and especially nice on Blu-ray because even the special features are of the highest quality visual and audio.  I won't spoil it, you'll have to judge for yourself but if you don't see it and like action movies, you're at a loss.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
B005EF1EX8|5.0|Awesome! Great story, great acting. I will have a difficult time waiting in my locked cellar for the coming season 5. OK, maybe I'm not in that bad of shape but I am addicted never-the-less.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me, saying this is just my style of show, at first because of the language thing and the extreme resembalance to Blair Witch I wasn't sure, but after the trolls first appear the movie takes on a whole new tone, much like Peter Jackson's King Kong, sure it has a slow start but once the big Ape shows up, eveything was well worth it!  In much the same way this movie looking back at troll lore and the way this was performed it was well worth seeing.  I won't spoil anything about the tale, but it's worth at least taking a look at, thanks for reading and have a nice day.
B005VMSATA|5.0|Great Movie. No Driving To A Store And A Movie Box. Good Price For 2 Days And Instant Streaming Is The Way To Go. A+

1433502410|5.0|This ESV study Bible contributes immeasurably to my depth of understanding of the messages in the words and phrases in each verse. I only wish I had purchased a version of it years ago! It's better than taking a class because you study in your own timeframe. The maps and illustrations are nicely done and add to my knowledge of locations of the stories and layouts of the towns. My previous Bible - the New English Bible - did not include any maps or background information at all on any of the books. The English Standard Version of the Bible is definitely a large step up and the way to go!
B005K17RU0|5.0|you all need to give honest reviews.  half 5 star half 1 star?  it appears kindle fire is incompatible.  everyone else loves it.  personally it is better for me than weatherchannel.com by a long shot.  I'm in New England.
B004EPYZT4|2.0|Not every movie needs to be re-made.  Or stolen from.  The original \\"Arnooold\\" Conan tells a superior tale of woe and warrior than the update.  I really like Jason Momoa from Game of Thrones, love Stephen Taylor from Avatar and Terra Nova, and Ron Jeremy from Sons of Anarchy.  But, the story in this movie is just flat and boring.  And a rip-off.  Here's what you learn in the first 30 seconds. (mild spoiler alert, but this is right in the beginning) There was an ancient, magical face mask made from pieces of bone.  When all the bone pieces are together, the mask wearer can rule other kings.  The original evil mask owner was vanquished long ago in an epic battle, and the mask's bone pieces were separated and spread about the land.  But, a new evil ruler-to-be wants to reassemble the mask, and needs all the pieces so he can - wait for it - rule all the other kings.  Sound familiar?  All this movie needs is Frodo and a ring and the rip-off would be complete.  I found myself drifting off.  The update changes up the story from the original obviously, and starts off promising a decent updating of a classic movie despite the been-there, done-that plot, but then it just drifts off into the same generic revenge movie you have seen a million times.  The swordfights are so frequent, uninspiring, and by the numbers, that you will find yourself wondering why you can't hear the music that all these choreographed fighters/dancers are dancing to. We never cared about any of the characters because they are so one-dimensional that you know what they are going to say and do before they do it on screen.<br /><br />Love the actors (I hope Jason becomes a movie star - his role on Game of Thrones as Khal Drogo was truly epic) but his talents are just wasted here.  Move along, nothing to see here.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded this app last night and it works just fine to be free. The rules are a little different and I have yet to win a game though...
1593974744|5.0|My girlfriend picked this audiobook out for a road trip up the west coast of the US and we could not have had a better time.  This is instantly one of my favorite science fiction stories.    The voice acting was spectacular and compounded the excellent writing to give the characters real depth. I was completely convinced of the depth and duality that was Ender Wiggin: a boy so completely ruthless while retaining his love, understanding, and innocence. That is quite the feat in a genre that sometimes exceeds cheesiness. Honestly, I think this book was written to be read outloud.  I was completely immersed in the story always wanting to know what was the next test for this little genius. Battle school, game theory, 3 demensional imagery... I couldn't wait for the next sequence. The descriptive style is so straight forward that you forget about the narration and become engrossed in the plot. You are right along side Ender the whole way and it's a great ride.  Almost every important character in the book is a child but don't be fooled, there are some serious themes that need to be considered for people under 13. According to the author this is completely by design. The age of the characters has a real impact on how you feel about what happens in the end.  Would recommend this to anyone, even those who may not usually read science fiction.
B004LUS390|5.0|Layers, plus all the basic tools. I like how this app is designed for sketching, without photo editing features. Get a soft stylus to really make some good sketches.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody has the most beautiful voice! I keep on listening the CD over and over, in my car, in the morning when I'm getting ready for work, at work, in the gym... The lyrics are so intimate, and easy to relate to, and that is what makes this album all so much more beautiful. She is a young singer with the depth of her expression that some more mature singers cannot compare to. I am buying another CD as a gift to my best friend. Cannot wait to hear more of her songs in the future.
B006ANJ4BW|4.0|I saw the original some 30 years ago and I must say the new version was a lot better. The acting, the actors and the special effects are really great. The new Conan, Jason Momoa was perfect for the part and his acting was so much better than Arnold's. It was well worth the money and time to watch.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I love my DVD of Stevie Wonder: Live at Last! I played it while having a party at my house and everyone was up dancing just like we were at his show.  You cant believe how clear it is.  You will forget you are looking at a tv.  You just have to have the experiece for yourself.  If you love Stevie you will love seeing him almost in person. A must Have!
B000002AOD|5.0|Really great stretching out, in a manner that is very accessible to less sophisticated listeners.  It's something that can be used to introduce people to what stretching out (musically) is about.

B004WMKSH2|1.0|I will never again buy a movie download from Amazon - every one I have is \\"currently unavailable\\" and has been for months! So, even though I bought and PAID for them, I can't get them to play, nor will they give me my money back.<br /><br />RIP OFF.
B005V20JKI|5.0|The best game I've played on Kindle Fire and is probably in the same class as Plants vs Zombies and Angry Birds for me. The only minor knock against it is that sometimes the controls (switching between jump and fire) are not as accurate or do not register the way I intended coming from a physical button perspective. I wish that pressing jump and then sliding your finger over the fire button would have the same effect as a physical controller but you get used to that minor issue pretty quickly.
B005IGVYUG|3.0|I've been reading a number of the reviews stating that Tom is a genius, national treasure, tapped into the soul of America, etc. IMHO, all of these things are true, and I think his great works (Rain Dogs, Swordfishtrombones, Mule Variations) are absolute, must have, desert island classics. Sadly, I don't believe that \\"Bad as Me\\" ranks up there with any of these works, nor do I think the album deserves the deluge of 5-star ratings being thrown at it.   Undoubtedly a new Tom Waits album is an event, and as aways he manages to say things in his unique fashion. Ironically, however, my problem is that the album's \\"strengths\\" highlighted by most of the other reviewers are in fact it's weaknesses, when measured against Tom's previous outputs and his status as our favorite off-beat icon. I agree fully that the songs are tightly-knit - the backing band is packed with luminaries, melodies and arrangements are carefully constructed, and Tom displays just about all of his various vocal persona's through the album. All of this makes for an easily accessible album with catchy hooks, but this isn't what I'm looking for when I sit down to listen to Tom. I can't shake the feeling that we are being treated to something formulaic, with all of the elements we know and love - some quirky instruments, a well-placed howl or growl, the gamut of emotions from rage to despair - being in attendance, but somehow Tom is going through the motions, showing off his skills and smarts, but neither baring his soul nor showing any new insights or musical directions. In many ways, it sounds more like an end-of career retrospective than a new beginning or \\"return to form\\".  Maybe I expect too much, but I think some realism is required amongst the idolatry amongst these reviews- this is a solid and polished album, but it is not a great one. It may also be a good introduction for those who don't know Tom's music (could this be possible?), but it doesn't get anywhere near to exposing his real genius.
0688014291|5.0|A brief and interesting read about management. It is not overly technical so it would benefit anyone wanting to improve their time management skills.
B006DA1OIS|5.0|I'm into mostly comedy ... But the preview intrigued me ...I watched the 1st episode and have been hooked ever since ..I highly recommend this series !! Will buy as a boxed set when the first season comes out ...Would definitely watch all over .. Peace Susan

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I fell in love with this film & knew I must have it before it was even halfway finished.   I have not been a diehard Woody Allen fan for a long time & have never seen an Owen Wilson film that i was crazy about. This will be my all-time favorite Woody Allen film; I have never seen a film of his that I liked this much. I even enjoyed Owen Wilson & thought he did a great job. Midnight in Paris is witty, intelligent, beautiful, melodic, creative & inventive.  The costumes are stunning as is the photography & foggy obscure moodiness.  It is magical & unique, showing a side of Paris' golden age that is rarely seen. It made me wish I could retreat in time with Gil. His fiancee & her family are perfect foils for the beauty & gentleness of the characters from the past.   I have an art background & thought that the depictions of various historic artists & writers to be spot on from my knowledge of their appearance, personalities, etc. These people are played by Marion Cotillard, Kathy Bates (as Gertrude Stein) & Adrien Brody (as Salvador Dali) among others. This was the most fascinating part for me.   I highly recommend it; it will stir your emotions & give you great joy.
0451167716|5.0|I read this book in 1971 when it first came out. To this day it remains the most gripping read of my life. 446 pages and I was up all night as a 16 year old reading. I finished it in a day and a half and I was not then a speed reader. I could not put it down. So, I was not biased by the movie in any way. The Godfather is a phenominal book. If I could pick a # 2, it would be \\" The Stand \\" by Stephen King.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Like the rest, i feel there havent been any good shows worth watching in a very long time, and i too LOVE this show............it is full of twists and turns and surprises and still a bit scary.........it leaves you hanging so much that you HAVE to see the next episode, and i too cant wait for the DVD, the only thing that is greater than TV is NO COMMERCIALS!!! that part sucks, but worth it..............

0345444051|5.0|Just received a new Kindle Fire.  Wow!  What Science has wrought. Have loved sci-fi as a young reader, 60 or so years ago, still into it.  My kids (now 49 and under) love it too.  Thought it befitting to make the first book on my KF \\"Childhood's End\\" by Arthur C. Clarke and what a disappointment!  Not available as an e-book.  I've read tons of books in all genres and this book still stands out in my mind for the ideas it presented.  Sir Arthur wrote this early in his career and with his background as a real Scientist is deserving of being read and listened to.  The metaphysical tone of many of his science fiction works are inspiring as well as mesmorizing.  There have been attempts to make a movie of this work but seem to be half-hearted efforts or dropped (Spielberg too?). So here's hoping this will stimulate others to ask for this as an e-book- I'll just have to wait and start with something else I guess. So many books, so little time. Thanks guys.
B005F3XV62|3.0|Kevin James is a good comic actor, when the comedy is slapstick physical humor or one-line zingers. He has the emotional range of a bowl of porridge. So this movie is fun when he's doing pratfalls or exchanging quips with the animals. When he puts on his plaintive face and tries to be serious, it descends to mush. He's not helped by some of the most trite dialog ever written and a plot that is obvious within the first five minutes.  Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb do their best with caricatures rather than characters. I wish they'd been given something more meaty to work with- both could have played good comic roles if they'd been given the chance. However, the animals aren't expected to be serious so they get most of the best lines and the best action.  This is a light-hearted way to spend an evening when you don't want anything thought-provoking and you'll get some good laughs along the way. That can't be a bad thing.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|A real kick ass movie! I procrastinated watching it because I listened to somebody else opinion then one day thought \\"I loved the first one so the hell with it!! I'm watching it!\\" Freaking awesome movie! Makes you want to live in it and the co-star Olivia is a Doll Face! OK watch it already!! A real good sequel to the last and Jeff Bridges is great as usual. A must own on Blu-ray for the Sci-fi fan. It has a great story, effects, Action, Music, and some real Eye Candy! What else does one need...enjoy!!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|There's no denying the impact Michael Jackson has had on popular music over the course of forty years. From the Jackson 5's first No. 1 (\\"I want you back\\" when Michael was eleven) through his untimely death at the age of fifty.<br /><br />I was still in high school when Michael and his brothers released four consecutive No. 1s (something not even the Beatles did). Despite Michael's popularity, I remained essentially a casual fan. I didn't buy a Michael Jackson album until THRILLER--an album that spawned seven hit singles and has sold over 100 million copies to date.<br /><br />I eventually bought 1995's HIStory and later 2001's GREATEST HITS. But if you're looking for one collection to hit all the highlights of a brilliant career (I bought mine as a Black Friday deal), this is everything the casual fan needs:  solo hits starting with 1971's \\"Got To Be There\\" through 1999's \\"You Rock My World\\" along with a sprinkling of Jackson 5/Jacksons hits. [The only glaring omissions are the duets with his sister Janet (\\"Scream\\") and Paul McCartney (\\"Say Say Say\\")]<br /><br />Overall, this is two and a half hours of music that changed the landscape of popular music forever. This music belongs in any serious collector's library. ESSENTIAL  [Running time - Disc 1, 78:56; Disc 2, 78:50]
B004T6IBNY|5.0|I first downloaded the free version on to my Toshiba Thrive. Selecting stretch to fill the screen instead of zoom gave great results. The ads were unobtrusive. It only took about an hour of game play to know that seeing a couple more tables was worth the price of admission. This is the only game I've taken the time to comment on, just to say I highly recommend it.
B001THZAAI|2.0|I watched this film in the company of some friends who told me in advance what a treat I was in for, and then fell asleep before the opening credits finished rolling (the friends did, not me!). Grossly over-caricatured stereotypes, horribly overacted rôles, impenetrable Ch'timi accents all made for a yawn-generating experience. There wasn't even a decent bit of eye-candy of either sex.  My mother-in-law is Ch'ti (complete with usually impenetrable accent), and she is vastly more entertaining than this pathetic attempt at humour. Heck, it even makes Woody Allen look funny! I can take most of the shortcomings of French cinema - the atrocious self conscious introspection, the endings that resolve nothing, the art for art's sake camera work, the wooden acting and ponderous plots - but not in something that's supposed to be comedy, for heaven's sake! For the first time ever, I found myself nostalgic for an Australian attempt at humour.  Give this one a miss unless you are (a) an extreme masochist or (b) doing doctoral research on moribund French patois.
0887307280|5.0|As an owner of a small business, I relate to the struggles that Gerber describes in the book. In it, he explains and emphasizes the importance of creating a systematic way of running a business so that owners and principals can focus on building and leading the business instead of working so hard in them. He explains the struggles of owners with finding staff, delegating jobs, and how to design a business in a way that employees can be easily found to run the business. Even though I've been taught this message before, reading through the author's examples and explanation really made it clear for me on how important these things are.
B005V20JKI|4.0|Totally worth the 2.99 paid for it. it works great on the kindle fire, ive really enjoyed playing it. I'm so happy I bought it. the sounds and the rainbow pooping unicorn alone make it worth the cost!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this constantly on my kindle fire.  It is awesome.  No more pieces of paper, and multiple notebooks (oh, and do I have a pen - pencil?).  All that has been replaced by Kindle and Evermore.  Thank you.e
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I won't bother with a recap, because there should be one in the description section. But this movie is totally awesome. Granted, the reason we watched it in the first place was because is has Collin Farrell and David Tennant in it, but it was a lot better than I expected. The vampire Jerry (as played by Collin Farrell) is one of the creepiest vampires I've seen, Farrell does a really good job of playing the totally weird creepy man vibe. It's a great contrast to recent...er...more sparkly takes on the vampire legend. David Tennant as the vampire slayer is... Well I laughed my butt off for the most part.  I don't want to give too much away, but some of the really good parts of this movie are:  The dialogue. It was darkly comedic and highly entertaining.  The vampire. Because he was so awesomely creepy the way a vampire should be, and yet still managed to be sexy.  The action and special effects were really well done, I thought. Though I'm no connoisseur of such things. They entertained me without being too cheesy, which is how I judge them.  Comedic bits were dabbled in all over the place, and I spent half my time cringing (from the suspense bits, not from badness) and the other half laughing. I like a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but still tries to give you a little something extra with the thrills and scares.  So, pretty much, for me, this movie was total win. I really enjoyed it, and I think you will too.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Must See TV series! If you're into X-files type of shows.. this would be the one to see. I love this series!

140053271X|3.0|I ordered the Nook Simple Touch online and was happy when it arrived quicker than expected.  I quickly tore into the packaging like a ten year old at Christmas and plugged the device into my computer.  I then attempted to closely follow the \\"quick start\\" instruction, but accidentally brushed through step 7 more quickly than I could read step 2...  Super easy set up!  I did run into one little hiccup when the screen when completely blank for a while and I thought I had prematurely ended it's existence...  Turns out it just didn't want to display anything while it had a discussion with the internet and I've come to expect this occasionally when accessing the internet, but it is usually very quick and never affects my reading.    Next, it was time to download my first book.  I already had a book in mind so I went to the \\"shop\\" icon and typed the book's name into the search bar.  The book I was searching for appeared instantly atop of several other ridiculous options.  I selected the book and in a couple touches it was downloading.  It downloaded quickly, but when I went to open the book I ran into some trouble.  The Nook was asking for confirmation via my credit card number!  OK, so I put the card number in.  Rejected, try again (or something to that effect).  After about ten tries, I calmly put the Nook down and asked Google for help.  I was directed to a help forum where many people were having this problem and there were plenty of possible solutions.  I tried some of them and after about half an hour I was finally able to open my book.  I still have no idea what caused this problem or what I did to fix it if anything, but I haven't had this particular problem since.    The reading experience was everything I had hoped it would be!  The letters stood out even more clearly than in most printed books and I was easily able to increase the text size just a touch to fit my preferred reading distance.  I have no trouble reading for extended periods of time as I have had with backlit e-readers which hurt my eyes after a while.  The options to change the font and size make it easy to find my spot quickly if I get distracted.  After a couple of days I decided I wanted a break from my very long book and thought I'd try a magazine or newspaper.  I had trouble finding one that I really wanted to read.  The selection seems awfully short and does not seem to match up to the selection the website provides.  There is a nifty little 14 day free trial that I like a lot.  I chose a magazine that I had never heard of but sounded interesting.  It turned out to be Socialist-Extremist psycho babble.  After reading several articles I got to my Mac and cancelled my subscription.  I do not hold B&N accountable for the content of this magazine, but I rated it as 1 star and unsubscribed and they still recommend other like minded subscriptions to me even though I've gotten other magazines and newspapers that I actually like since.  I have determined that they do not do a very good job of making recommendations.  Also, if you want to read more about the publication or customer reviews, you must go online to do it - it can not be done from the Nook.  After canceling my subscription I decided to read the reviews of that magazine and would never have chosen it had I read them first.  Thank goodness for that 14 day free trial!  I also decided to subscribe to another magazine that I found in the \\"My Nook\\" online account that I could not find in through actual Nook.  That subscription is showing up in my online library, but not on the Nook itself.  After another half hour of research, it appears that the Nook accounts do not sync very well and tons of people are having this problem. Learning point: never order something online in the \\"My Nook - My Library\\" and expect to actually read it.    I also do not like the way that newspapers and magazines are presented.  It's very confusing how you have to go through the introduction to several articles before you can actually read any article.  I realize that this is much like seeing the cover of an actual printed publication, but I am not forced to read every intro before opening the cover of a magazine and when it changes sections it is easy to not realize that you are now back to a cover section and think you are going to get the entire article only to be cut off when you turn the page.  I have gotten used to this, but I still don't like it.  I also do not believe that this is Nook specific.  This appears to be the format for all e-readers, although I haven't tried it on all of them.  Regardless of my complaints, I am actually very happy with the Nook Simple Touch itself.  The process at Barnsandnoble.com needs some massive improvement and I could not review the Nook without addressing these concerns.
B005IGVYUG|2.0|well he never claimed to be a singer with a great voice but no one can say he does not have a very distinctive voice. If you are a fan you will love this cd.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|it's got all the battles for the guys and plenty of eye candy with a love story for the girls... not to mention the movie is just really well made and is something you can sink into without a moment of being bored. Great story, great acting, great effects...

0743527305|5.0|Peck has the gift of insight of self within the pages of this work.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and got one for my husband on CD for the car.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of Ryan Gosling, but I will say he did a nice job in this movie. I do love Steve Carell, though, and he exudes sincerity as he does so well in dramatic roles. This movie was engaging on many levels, because so many different stages of love are addressed. I typically groan at the sight of a romantic comedy and even though this is one in a way, it also has deeper themes. Well done.
1892005034|5.0|This book has proven invaluable for opening communication with my spouse.  Though it was recommended to us as a tool for anger management, I feel that this book is worth its weight in gold.  I have been recommending it to everyone I know and have even purchased a few copies as gifts for friends.  Wonderful work by Rosenberg!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I got in on the very end of it but the movie had me hooked and I needed to see it from the beginning. This is one of the best true story movies I have ever seen and would  recommend it to anyone that loves dogs. Be prepared with Kleenex in hand you will need it.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady A has done it again with a great album.This is an excellent buy.I have really enjoyed each and every song on this album.
B005V4FJC4|2.0|So I love Zooey but you and I could have cranked this album out in our basement and gotten better results. Massive reverb, very little instrumentation and uninspired vocalisation. I wouldn't pay to hear here sing and I don't think you will either. These reviewers that give albums like this 4 stars, that are also top reviewers should be ashamed of themselves for endorsing musical junk.
B005JZBP8W|2.0|I watched the BluRay last night on an OPTOMA DLP projector.  While it does look better than the DVD, it leaves A LOT to be desired.  First off, the film is at a 2:35:1 ratio, instead of 2.20:1, which is the correct aspect ratio for a movie shot on a 65mm negative/70mm printed format.  This leads me to believe that a 35mm source was used.  Second, AND BY FAR THE WORST, is the color shift from left to right in the WHOLE movie.  10% of the screen on the left and 10% on the right had different color density.  On my projector, the left had greenish tones, the 70-80% in the middle looked good, and the 10% on the right was pinkish.  During the night scenes, the pinkish on the right looked green, as if too much light was going through the film when it was projected.  This is completely unacceptable, especially for masterpiece!  Another thing I noticed is that jitter is noticeable during some scenes.  This also indicates that the transfer is not recent.  I would not be surprised if CBS used the exact same restoration, with no additional work, that was prepared for the 1994 laserdisc release.  The audio, while better than anything I have heard on home video, should also has been improved.  While there is a nice dynamic range, it still sound restrained, and there is a weird reverb added to the back speakers during musical numbers, as if this was an old Dolby ProLogic home theater effect that was kept.  After the movie is over, the closing credits are exactly the same as on the laserdisc box set, listing people who worked on the restoration with a 1994 copyright date.  When I bought the disc last weekend, the first thing that went through my mind when I picked up the packaging is that it looked like a bootleg.  So sad for such a distinguished movie!  Even though I had read the reviews, I bought it because it does look better than both the laserdisc and the DVD.  This is only because the bluray platform supports higher resolution, not because of work put into the film by CBS.  Oh well....maybe the rights will be transferred again and a more respectable studio will release it in the manner that \\"Sound of Music\\" was restored.
B005HNG1S0|1.0|The orchestra plays beautifully, however, Ms. Grimaud's piano part sounds more dull than dulcet with willful rubatos from the beginning to the end. The music has lost its nuance and gracefulness. Maestro Abbado is quite right to give up the recording with her, I guess the conductor is more concerned about the quality of palying than which cadenza to use. And it is shame for Grimaud and DG to bring the matter to public and try to make profit from it.
030788743X|5.0|Even though the pace seemed slow because it seemed that nothing was happening, it was still engaging. It's definitely unpredictable. When I just knew what was going to happen, I was totally surprised that something else happened instead. Even the description of the virtual reality game world was engaging and fun to read.  I felt a great connection with the main character, Wade, from the beginning and rooted for him throughout the book. The Sixers were great villains. I loved the descriptions of the vast multilayer universe that's the OASIS. This will be a book that I remember years down the road because it's really captivating. I want to read more books like it. There's a lot of imagination that went into this book and I liked that.   There was only one thing I had an issue with and it was the character's relationship with his aunt. I didn't believe that he hated his aunt that much that he didn't care about what had happened to her.  It was a really fun read. I stayed up all hours of the night every night reading this book and at weird, random times found myself unknowingly referring to the book as \\"a game.\\"  I'd like to see a sequel to this book if only to see how the character uses his new player powers.  Full disclosure - This is an ARC (advanced reader copy) I'm reviewing.
B004EPYZQ2|2.0|J.J. Abrams, \\"Super 8\\" unabashedly draws on Spielberg films such as \\"E.T\\", \\"Close Encounters of the the Third Kind\\" and even a little of his version of the \\"War of the Worlds.\\"  The story is pretty contrived and the ending very predictable.  It's obvious how it's going to turn out after about 45 minutes, especially with a bunch of kids leading the cast.  Given that the film is presumed to be set in the late 70s, I'm pretty sure the use of \\"totally\\" as an affirmative had not yet entered teen-speak by that time, at least in Ohio.  L.A., maybe --  Ohio, never.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|My son and I love silly movies from the 80's. This is a must for any collection. My 12 yo loves it.
B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|Hate that you can't \\"Play All\\" four episodes straight through on disk (Like my Burn Notices and White Collars can...) CBS, are you taking notes...???
B004EPYZU8|5.0|This has future cult favorite written all over it. Complex, awesome special effects, and a fun cast to boot. If you didn't enjoy it the first time, I definitely recommend watching it again. Zack Snyder really shows off his skills with this film and I can officially call myself a big fan of his work now. So enjoy and make sure to go in with an open mind.
0393064476|4.0|I have been visiting castles and historic sites in France and Jersey on weekends for a couple of months, and just spent a week vacationing in Barcelona touring museums, Montserrat, Segrada Familia, and Tarragona.  I was particularly impressed on my visit to Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya in Barcelona, which is an incredible monument to the totalitarian culture of Catholicism.  I don't know if it is an intended selection of representative pieces, but there is only one thought expressed artistically in the Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance, and Baroque collections, and that one thought of course is the founding myth of Christianity.   I read this book to add some perspective to how the feudal system built on the ruins of Roman culture by the Catholic church could partially replicate the enormous building projects of its predecessors.  I am pondering why it is that religious culture can undertake at enormous cost over centuries the planning and building of architectural marvels such as Mont St. Michael, Segrada Familia, Notre Dame,  and the thousands of lesser known basilicas and monasteries throughout the world.  There are no such artifices to reason and knowledge, only to myths.  At least until the Renaissance, these projects were always coupled to an oppressive totalitarian state that coerces the project from a subjugated population.    The Swerve does not provide encompassing answers to this dynamic, it is not intended as comprehensive history of the evolution of the modern state from the rotting tree of medieval feudalism.  But it does offer very entertaining glimpses into how an idea that was orders of magnitude more insightful and proven to be a much closer approximation to the nature of our existence than Christianity re-emerged after 1000 years of oppression.   As illustrated in the recounting of the execution of Jan Hus for articulating an idea, I can correlate the absolute power of the state to suppress non-conformity among the educated to the ability to coerce the illiterate and uninformed to give to the state at levels that surely degraded their lives, increased their hunger, and jeopardized their safety.  One can see that sacrifice in the incredible relics built in medieval times for the church, and in pre-400 AD for the Roman Empire.  The Swerve provided a lot of interesting sidebars to my tourism and understanding of the sites I have visited, as well as to my background readings on the history of Europe.  I agree with other reviewers that the poem by Lucretius is over-emphasized as a sort of holy grail of reason that exploded into the 16th century to create the Renaissance.  It is impossible to know how pervasive the ideas articulated by Lucretius were in this time period.  Clearly, it was hazardous to one's health to put forward ideas in a totalitarian police state that colored, confronted, or refuted the official mythology.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|works great on the amazon fire. I can view my picasa albums and photos. it has customisable settings and is easy to use
B00177Y9ZC|2.0|I thought this movie was weak because it had no real moral center.  It pits jumpers, who are people who can teleport, but never seem to do anything positive for society, against Paladins, who want to wipe out the jumpers.  The main jumper character is typical of why I didn't particularly like jumpers.  He robs banks, frames a young rival for his own bank robbery, and never, ever tells his girlfriend the truth.  Heroic behavior?  Hardly. The main Paladin, played by Samuel Jackson, seemed more like a good guy to me, although his methods were of course way too extreme (no trial, death penalty).  So for me, there was lots of great action, a little humor, and no good guys.  That detracts from the movie.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|If you are Pink Floyd fan but are only going to see this movie for the first time, do not let any negative reviews cause you to think twice about buying this film. This movie is Deep. You either understand it or you don't. Appreciate it for what it is and the statements that it makes. Remember that it was made 30 years ago. Enjoy
B006D9EJ3Q|5.0|This show just keeps delivering winning episodes. I don't even watch much on television, but I watch this show every week. The acting and writing are superb. This particular episode adds even more layers to the ongoing story line. The developments this week are quite intriguing. Watch it!!!!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book is a refreshing!  Filled with words of wisdom to remind us all why we need less, not more.  Well worth the little spent to purchase the kindle edition.  Thank you!!
0060775858|5.0|just buy it, don't bother reading the reviews, it's good, it's classic, kids love it, don't ask why, just get it.
B004HO6I4M|4.0|My kids are really into this movie and there's nothing too bad as far as content that will be over their head. (As with most movies these days with the adult humor.) Fun, entertaining, great for the animal lovers.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Movies are not art, I repeat movies are not art. I love real art, but movies are just entertainment, deal with it.
B005MHSELS|4.0|I like this show a lot, because the writers pay a lot of attention to details and spend useful time even on seemingly secondary scenes. This helps make a very solid narration, and helps the viewer stay close to then plot. For example, when Walt buys a gun illegally, we are treated to a long lecture by the seller, which makes us understand how deep Walt's motives are. Yet the seller is the most peripheral of characters in that episode.   I appreciate it when a show maintains that kind of quality for more than the very first two seasons.   The filming is also sensible, without the excess of extreme close-up shots on people's faces.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is a great useful app. The only reason I docked it a star is that the ads are literally below the small dismiss button. When waking, without my glasses, I have often inadvertently hit the ad instead of Dismiss, which then sets off the panic reaction of reversing back to the alarm in order to quiet the crescendo. Otherwise, very pleased, highly reliable. Recommend.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|So this isn't the kind of life-changing movie that makes a person consider the meaning of life or anything, but it's really sweet, funny, and well done. I've seen it twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. I recommend it for date night or girls' night in.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I love this series and hope they continue with it.  You won't be dissapointed with this original take on an old story.
0140074317|5.0|Never ordered from this book store before.  Book arrived promptly and I found the book to have never been read before.  Very minor nicks at the bottom corners.  Advertised as used but looked new.  As I read the book it becomes apparent the movie left out most of this terrific adventure for the mind.  A must read for everyone.  Thumbs up to Amazon and the book store, thank you.
B002PEP4SC|3.0|The book is not bad, but it's a little confusing when you expected a comment from castle and does not appear.   Could be perfectly any other characters, but the book has been written with the characters in the tv series leaving out the most important of them.  Only for fans.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Captain America is an American World War II superhero movie of a rejected U.S. Army recriut Steve Rodgers in 1943. It took him 5 tries until Dr. Abraham Urshkin gives him only a chance to be recriuted. Nobody believed Rodgers could enlist, because he was short, weak, whimpy, and contained health issues. The U.S. Army was working on a top secret scientific project that can turn a human being into a supersoldier. In boot camp, Steve Rodgers was tested to his ability determining his skills for combat and being picked to be transformed into a supersoldier and ended up  failing the tests. Colonel Phillips didn't want Urskin to make sure Rodgers was transformed in to a supersoldier due to his poor performance. Dr. Urshkin still again picks him, because he was looking for inner strength, which Rodgers had. The next morning, Steve Rodgers became Captain America and was transformed into a supersoldier with big muscles, super speed, strength, etc. He was sent overseas to fight HYDRA, the Nazi deep science division led by Johann Scmidt (Red Skull). Captain America was expected to return with full victory for America and defeat HYDRA. The movie Captain America demonstrates heroism, confidence, and determination to reach your goals.

1405758082|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3IM1K6MWY1VKX]]THE UK'S LEADING TAX HANDBOOK NOW IN ITS LATEST EDITION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This latest edition of `Tiley & Collison's' -- the 29th -- has now arrived from Tolley LexisNexis and it does not disappoint.  Not for nothing has it been referred to as `the leading UK tax handbook.'  Over nearly 3,000 pages, it covers all the principal taxes:  income tax; capital gains tax; corporation tax; inheritance tax; national insurance contributions; stamp taxes and value added tax.<br /><br />Meticulously footnoted, it is divided logically into ten parts, each dealing with a particular form of tax, although Part I deals the fundamentals of taxation, from tax administration to avoidance, allowances and reliefs.  Case law is thoroughly analysed throughout and, although the volume is self-contained, with any number of examples, there are extensive cross references to further information in LexisNexis looseleaf publications.<br /><br />Practitioners and specifically tax advisers should find the book reassuringly erudite, authoritative and, certainly, very well organized. This is, indeed, a comfort when dealing on behalf of clients with the HMRC.<br /><br />Joint editor Keith Gordon seems to have had experiences with the tax authorities which are alarmingly similar to the rest of us, prompting him to refer to comments from a certain judge who described, (for example) HMRC's dispute resolution methods as `\\"high handed\\" and their approach \\"illogical\\", \\"inexplicable\\", \\"unfair\\" and \\"falling very far below the standard of fair dealing and conscionable conduct to be expected of an organ of the State\\".<br /><br />`There is undoubtedly something rotten in the state of HMRC and a further cut in its already depleted resources will make the much-needed improvements even harder to come by,' Gordon adds.<br /><br />His commentary ends on an optimistic note, however, observing that at its core, `HMRC is staffed by individuals who are trying to do their best to deliver a professional service....'  On balance, Gordon's case for optimism is well founded, we believe, as the new `listening' government grapples with the many difficulties which continue to confound tax gatherers and tax payers alike.<br /><br />In this challenging and complex tax environment, it's good to know about Tiley and Collison's, especially this new edition which contains full consideration of all legislation enacted and all cases reported up to the end of August 2011.  There are almost 200 pages of cases and statutes at the back and a detailed 72 page index.  In offering this wealth of resources in one volume, this indispensable guide certainly deserves its status as the up-to-date tax practitioner's best friend.best to deliver a professional service....'

B005F96URI|5.0|Heard from a friend about this movie. We're into japanese music and already knew who Gackt was. I have heard him sing and seen him act finding that he can do both well. He starred alongside another popular japanese singer (Hyde) in Moon Child, and has been acting in a television series in japan.   Thanks to that I was already excited about this movie. It didn't disappoint me. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this movie is very much my style. Interesting story, characters, and some good actors help make this movie awesome. It mixes several different things together giving it an interesting feel. The pop-up like animation scenes are well done and one of my favorite things about the movie. Of course, I love the fighting as well.   (Spaghetti western & samurai mix) fun fact: the old Spaghetti westerns were actually re-adaptations of Japanese samurai shows. Remade as westerns to the T. So much so that the people looked alike and the lines were the exact same.  Sugoi desu yo!  I definitely recommend giving this a watch. Even if you don't like it it's an interesting experience.
0754540456|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2K3YJW3BPEH5J]]<br />PRACTICAL PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE OF YOUR PERSONAL AND FAMILY ESTATE<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />With this new work of reference from Tolley LexisNexis the authors Sharon McKie and Simon McKie have, produced a highly detailed and authoritative statement of the law relating to planning how to deal with those of your personal and family resources that constitute an estate.<br /><br />The authors point out that while this is a work on taxation, it's not exclusively so, for estate planning involves much more than just endeavouring to minimize exposure to tax.<br /><br />Just how complex this area of law is can be ascertained by a mere glance at the table of contents. Taking the practical approach needed to achieve the most desirable results at the lowest cost, the book contains chapters on trust law, settlements, offshore trusts, insurance, pensions, the family home, the family business, the family farm, woodlands, charitable donations, and heritage property.<br /><br />Estate planning must also take account of the more fraught aspects of life that can impact for good or ill on personal wealth, from matrimonial breakdown, to making a will and Post-death estate planning.  There are also useful chapters pertaining to the expatriate client,  either overseas or `internationally mobile'  dealing with such issues as domicile and residence...considerations for the long term resident... and disclosure of tax avoidance schemes.<br /><br />In short, this superbly useful book covers virtually every conceivable aspect of estate planning, which as the authors suggest, is `both a science and an art'. Planning is not just planned, it's sustained.  It's an ongoing process taking into account that when you plan for the future, it turns into the present, which in turn recedes into the past.<br /><br />To illustrate these points, the authors have intriguingly included an imagined example of the progress of one imagined life within an imagined family.  It's a step-by-step case study of estate planning.  If you were born in 1986, would your forward planning for the conservation of your resources stretch to 2071?  There's no one right or wrong answer to this of course and the case study cannot include such unpredictable variables as tax and legislative changes, or political and economic change, or changes to personal circumstances.  But, what an excellent illustration of the benefits of a clear-sighted, rational and certainly optimistic long-term approach to estate planning this is!<br /><br />If you are in any way involved professionally in estate planning, this book offers a reliable and practical approach to this often complicated subject.  Logically structured, the book provides the expected research resources, including tables of statutes and cases and a detailed index. The publication date is August 2011.amily.

This thorough and extensive volume of almost 2,000 pages deals with the taxation of UK individuals working abroad and foreign nationals working in the UK and  looks at the complexities of tax planning, both from employee and employer viewpoints, as appropriate.<br /><br />From an employer's point of view, the key factors in expatriate tax planning centre on the way employment arrangements are structured which will in turn affect both taxation and social security contributions.<br /><br />Key considerations here centre on type of work, the place of employment duties and whether the employee should be employed and paid locally, or in the home country.<br /><br />As for the employee, his or her tax liability and level of social security contributions will depend on certain key factors.  These generally centre on location: of home country, for example...of place of employment...of place of personal residence...or the location of the employee's family...or indeed the location where the individual may either end the employment or eventually retire.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the book discusses domicile and residence and taxation of general earnings before detailing the implications of a host of other issues, from tax, NICs and expense deductions and exemptions to pensions, share-based incentives, double taxation, capital taxes and more.<br /><br />In our initial review we described this extensive and thorough work of reference as `definitive' and so it remains.  This, however, is the updated edition which deals with all relevant new material in this field, notably the Finance Act 2011 and the new EC social security contributions rules from 1 May 2010, including the latest guidelines from HMRC.  It also covers the new exchange rate rules and the latest guidance from HMRC on calculating foreign earnings.<br /><br />Designed for ease of use, this is a reference book which should save the practitioner any amount of time. Usefully, it provides extensive tables of statutory instruments, cases and international and European legislation, as well as nine appendices and a detailed index. The publication date is July 2011.nitive' and so it remains.

B0017KIBAI|4.0|Ordered a gamecube controller from this company. It was a little more expensive than other places, but it was guaranteed to be nintendo brand, so it was worth it (many sites with cheaper controllers say they are nintendo brand, but they turn out to be offbrand). The order shipped promptly, and the controllers arrived in good condition with only minor wear, as described. Overall very pleased.

B0029XFN9O|3.0|So a spoiled 1% brat decides to torture two poor 99% men that have resorted to burglary as a last means to provide income. Rather than call the police and tell them he is lost and let them know the location of the burglars, he goes on a spending spree in New York, eats pizza in a limousine before preparing an elaborate set of traps involving repeated pummeling with bricks and heavy tools, spilling paint and varnish on skin, electrocution and setting fire to the poor men with kerosene. Then he has a chat about the importance of trust with a homeless person and feels good about himself. Pretty bad life lesson.  They should make a sequel where he is grown up in the Army working as a prison guard on the night shift at Abu Ghraib.
0439023521|5.0|I could not put the book down!  You have to read this.  I wouldn't say this is for young readers or the faint of heart.  This is unlike anything I have ever read before.
0553801473|1.0|The established characters do little but move in place the whole book. Nothing happens until the \\"surprise twist\\" at the end... which isn't exciting so much as leaving a bad taste in the mouth. Avoid the book.. read the wikipedia synopsis instead.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|This movie is awesomely fun. Anyone who loves the horror genre and b-movies should enjoy this from start to finish. It's a classic that I will watch many times. I can only hope this inspires a few more movies like it.
B0041KKYGA|5.0|Fantastic recreation of 16th c London and its remarkable cast of characters. Snippets of Shakespeare plays staged imaginatively as they might have been and birdseye views of London made this worth seeing whether or not you buy into the authorship question. There aren't enough epic history movies these days so this one was a treat. Vanessa Redgrave is a credible Elizabeth I in her later years but the palaces, theaters, streets, taverns and cityscapes are the real stars. The era comes to life through the enormous \\"sets\\" that are infinitely fascinating down to the smallest details - well done!
B008FVZHKO|5.0|One of the best bands, even though I arent into much metal but compare to morbid angel, etc, I don't consider this as real metal,<br /><br />It has metal elements in it, and some of the songs on older albums sounds like the Ozric Tentacles.<br /><br />Its more like future Pink Floyd which isnt a bad thing. Steve is a good singer, etc.<br /><br />Believe me or not I discover this band at midddle 2000s because in some chat room which is corny, I talked to some one else that loved ozric tentacles like me, he kept on surggesting me to get into Porcupine Tree, anyway this band comes close but isn't real metal like those bands such as rotting christ, morbid angel, etc.<br /><br />Anyway for those who arent into death metal or black metal then maybe this band should be worth checking out. Its not death or black, its like more geared towards progressive rock or progressive metal.<br /><br />Ozric Tentacles is sort of progressive rock too. But that band is more known as psychedelic rock with world music elements in it, same with trance.<br /><br />The album called metanoia from Porupine Tree is only one that really comes close to Ozric Tentacles.<br /><br />The album The sky move sideways, comes close to ozric tentacles too.<br /><br />Most of the music is like progressive and heavier version of Pink Floyd...not all but it def. has some pink floyd elements in it

B0042U94UQ|5.0|Didn't really want to watch this movie so we ended up waiting for it to go to the \\"cheap theater\\" to take the kids. After watching it, we all loved it. Was pleasant for kids and adults to watch. Ordered it for my 4 year old for Christmas. The only bad thing is that it is addicting to quote! I work maintenance and hear grown men in their 30's quoting this movie there.<br /><br />Great movie and always shipped fast with Amazon Prime!

0805091742|5.0|A straightforward book that is not too long, the Checklist Manifesto will change your life and turn you into a checklist maker.  The book notes that there are different types of checklists : DO: CONFIRM and READ: DO.  The first, DO: CONFIRM is when you automatically do stuff (like starting your car in the morning) and then you quickly glance at your check list to confirm that you did everything correctly and didn't miss a step.  The READ: DO is where you go through the list first and then do the action; usually used for more complex tasks.  Checklists are no easy matter.  They must be brief and have \\"breaks\\" or a pause so that tasks don't become too complex.  I think the key point that the author, Dr. Gawande, makes is that checklists don't turn you into an automaton or make you robotic but actually free up your creativity because the mundane boring tasks are taken care of and out of the way first.  This allows your mind to focus on the quirky, more difficult aspects of the job.  Finally, Dr. Gawande gives many examples where checklists make a difference but they all have one quality in common.  Folks who use checklists are folks who must actually DO SOMETHING.  They must get the job right.  Be it a pilot; a surgeon; a chef at a major restaurant, they are required to perform precisely. There is little room for error.  Especially in tense, panicky moments, it a good to have a checklist ready to focus your mind on certain tasks.  In tough situations, the checklist can jump start your thinking and calm you down because you are plunged into doing the proper work and focussed on the job at hand. Instead of panicking and asking, \\"what do I do?\\" the checklist provides an immediate guide and gets your mind thinking about the problem even if only in a subconscious way.  A very vital and important book.
B005FUTBWS|1.0|I heard a glowing review of this on the radio, and I made the \\"note to self\\" to watch it as soon as I had time.  These two reviewers were oogling over it as though it had been their most profound moving-going experience in decades.  That is the LAST time I take any of their recommendations.  I guess I must have seen the \\"Holy God This Sucks\\" edit of Red State, as most others seemed to really like it.  I thought this movie was horrible.  It ranks right up at the top of my \\"Thanks-I'll-Never-Get-That-Time-Back\\" list with \\"Wanted\\", \\"Fast and the Furious\\", and \\"Paranormal Activity\\" as total and utter wastes of my life.  And, honestly, it is WORSE than those three horrible pieces of film trash because it was supposed to be some \\"psychological thriller\\" or \\"horror film\\" to be taken seriously by critics and audiences alike.  Honestly...it's angering what a disappointing waste this movie was.  First off, it was absolutely predictable from beginning to end.  If you read any basic synopsis then watch for about five minutes, you can pretty much figure out what will happen.  Oh, wait...the BIG shocker was the trumpets playing.  Yay.  How is this a horror film?  Brazen acts of murder do not make it a horror film, nor do they make it a \\"psychological thriller\\".  Remember \\"Seven\\"?  THAT was a psychological thriller.  The \\"scariest\\" part of Red State was having to sit through about 10 minutes of crazy preacher man's sermon.  I felt like I was back in parochial school, suffering through another mindless endless lecture (although I was fortunate enough to not hear it through a covered dog cage).  I love Kevin Smith.  His earlier works are some of my all-time favorite movies.  I watched this piece of crap from beginning to end, having faith that such a brilliant person would pull it together in the end and make it all worthwhile.  Alas, he did not.  Again...shocking...angering.  Maybe that was the \\"psychological twist\\":  You watch the movie then realize how much time you wasted, thenyou feel shocked that Kevin Smith actually had a hand in this, and finally are angry that he'd put his name to such a thing.  He took some random thoughts, headlines, and conspiracy theories, put them in a Cuisinart, vomited them into a pail and threw it onto the screen.  This is not ground-breaking.  This is not thought-provoking or moving.  It doesn't scare you into thinking \\"oooohhh, what does our government REALLY do\\".  It just makes you think, \\"Hmm.  I could have learned about 6 life lessons from a few episodes of the 'Smurfs' in the time I wasted watching 'Red State'.
B005R4255C|5.0|This album is WONDERFUL and the remixes are AMAZING! Any real hard core MJ fan would enjoy having this album in their collection. I personally can't wait to see the show in Las Vegas soon! My favorite mix on the album is Is It Scary/Threatened! What a mix! Don't hesitate, buy this album!
B005JU5JTI|1.0|I was hoping for some quality comedy, but the best parts were in the trailer.  This movie was pert-near a B movie!  What a seriously dumb move on my part in purchasing this rental.  At least I didn't buy the movie.  I would say that it is worth 99 cents.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|After Under the Dome, I didn't know if I could handle another thousand page round from King, but glad I did.  It's definately not your usual King book (I am a long time King reader) and I think it might be one of the best. There is a change in his writing in the book and even the ending.  I read it fast and look foward to the next one.
B005SFS4ZU|2.0|Now to be fair, I had high expectations. This is my favorite musical of all time and from the Royal Albert Hall in London! I've seen Phantom at least three times in Portland, twice in Eugene, and once on Broadway. I say at least because I'm pretty sure I've seen it a few more times that I just can't pinpoint. I used to dream of playing Carlotta. I memorized all the parts in \\"Prima Donna\\". I even watched the travesty of the movie in theatres! To me there is no musical that better embodies everything that a stage production can be. This production took almost everything I loved about the musical and threw it back in my face.<br /><br />Now I've rarely seen a musical performed with a perfect cast (exceptions must be made for the Rent Farewell Tour and the Aida Pre-Premier Show on Broadway) but this was pathetic. I didn't expect the Phantom to be on Michael Crawford's level, but it would have been nice if he could have expressed any emotions other than apathy and rage and maybe held a pitch. That would have been nice. Speaking of not holding pitch, Christine had the ear-splitting problem of constantly singing sharp while Carlotta sang perfectly except in rare and clearly purposefully screeching occasions. Carlotta and Piangi were actually the highlights of the show vocally. Andre and Firmin were excellent as well. For those less familiar with Phantom of the Opera, that's like saying that Harry and Voldemort were both terrible but Crab and Goyle were marvelous! I've seen productions where the Phantom or Christine are sub-par before but it takes special talent for both to be incapable of holding a note for more than a beat.<br /><br />Let's set aside the cast then. Other than the casting director apparently being tone-deaf surely the play must have been excellent. This was, after all, the Royal Albert Hall. They must have made the most of such a grand stage. Sure they did, by covering it in giant low-resolution television screens that move instead of using all the amazingly intricate stage effects normally employed in the show. The mirror in Christine's dressing room that the Phantom appears in and leads Christine to his lair through? Nope! Giant TV instead. Candles that rise out of the fog-covered stage? TV screen. Phantom appears out of nowhere during the masquerade then disappears in a puff of smoke? Just move that TV screen. Not to mention that all the sets and the curtains rising and falling were just images on the screens. It also would have been nice if the screens weren't such bad quality that every pixel was the size of a ping pong ball or if the candles on the TVs weren't the size of small children. The moving center screen glitched occasionally too just adding to the list of reasons they were a bad idea.<br /><br />Okay. So they messed around with the staging but otherwise the play was the same, right? Even if you ignore that they cut the Christine-in-a-wedding-dress dummy so Christine randomly faints for no reason and is wearing a wedding dress that apparently came from nowhere in the final scene I think we can all agree that Raoul giving Christine a ring is pretty important especially with the Phantom's line, \\"Your chains are still mine\\". Not to mention a tiny plot point of the chandelier. That's right, the chandelier. Instead of it falling it shorts out... or something. It flickered a bunch and sparks flew from it. I guess that can be counted as \\"a disaster beyond imagination\\" since the chandelier wasn't electric. It wouldn't have been quite so awkward if they hadn't kept talking about the \\"new chandelier\\" and the \\"shattered chandelier\\". Guys, you blew a few light-bulbs. Just replace them. I saw another production where the chandelier didn't fall. It sucked then too.<br /><br />Now you'd think at this point there would be nothing left to screw up. You'd be wrong. On top of everything else there were all these little choreography problems. Christine pulls off the Phantom's mask in the \\"I Remember ... / Stranger Than YouDreamt It ...\\" scene the Phantom is turned to much towards the audience giving a clear view of his hideously deformed face for a moment before he covers it with his hand, the lasso around Raoul's neck in the \\"Down Once More ... / Track Down This Murderer ...\\" scene was hanging loose so Raoul literally had to hold it up, and when the Phantom went to free Raoul he turned on the candle that he uses to burn the rope before touching it to the other candle to \\"light\\" it there's a loud enough click to the button that you can clearly hear it and the giant black button is turned toward the audience. The giant black button was so ridiculous the audience in the theatre I was in started laughing. Really? Isn't it in stage 101 to not hold the candle so the giant button is showing?<br /><br />Then there was the horribly disappointing after-show where Sarah Brightman sang, to my horror but not surprise, while wearing the most unflattering dress she could have dug out of her closet. She was joined by several men who had played the Phantom; Colm Wilkinson, Antony Warlow, John Owen-Jones, Peter Joback, and Ramin Karimloo. Notice who's missing? Michael Crawford was in attendance but topped off my disappointment by not singing.<br /><br />So was there anything worthwhile in this concert? I'll be honest. I'm going to buy the Blu-ray. It will be nice to have a full recording of the play including dialogue and lyrics that don't appear in the soundtracks or movie and to have beautiful detail shots of the costumes and it's nice to see the masquerade played out without the use of mannequins but those are the only redeeming points to this performance. I can honestly say that I have never seen Phantom put on so badly. My only explanation is that Sir Andrew Lloyd Weber is losing his mind in his old age. Between this and \\"Love Never Dies\\" he couldn't do the Phantom more disservice. At this point he ought to take \\"By Jeeves\\" back to the drawing board for a third try. He can't do worse.

I have been a crazy cat lady since birth and have friends that are too. After buying this for myself, i couldnt help but buy additional copies for friends. They have all sent me great thanks and have confessed they too have read their book cover to cover multiple times and have not stopped laughing. This is the best book ever for cat lovers..buy it and enjoy many laughs. Love this and so does my husband!
0545265355|1.0|If I could give these books 0 stars I would.  The plot line was disgusting and violent.  I would never in a million years let my adolescent children read it.  I am an adult and the themes gave me nightmares.  You leave these books feeling depressed and without hope.  Evil and violence win.  The main character goes crazy and is suicidal.  What is the author trying to teach children...that hope is a bad thing?  That love never overcomes obstacles?  That killing is ok and a form of entertainment?  I would rather burn these books then donate them to my library for some kid to read.

1591840562|4.0|This is an entrepreneurship guide that explains what it takes to transform an idea into a succesful startup company. The book describes the different difficulties any startup has to deal with. It tackles subjects such as: the business plan, the bootstrapping stage, funding,... We could say that it focuses mainly on IT companies although the general principles are valid for almost any company. The book is easy-to-read, does not ramble and is peppered with a pinch of entrepreneurial philosophy which is always encouraging when you're about to choose the red-pill. I found particularly interesting the chapter about raising capital....valuable advice from someone who lives in the Valley and knows very well what it's all about.  There are hundreds of books about running a business. I chose this one basically for the author: Guy Kawasaki. I first knew him when I read the foreword of Presentation Zen, and I thought that a guy that can write a so awesome introduction, must have lots of smart things to say.  To sum up, the book is good and sometimes brilliant. It's not overly optimistic which is always welcome; can't bear those stupid books that make you believe everything is possible if you try it, when we all know it doesn't work that way.
B003LPR4ZK|2.0|Based on all the good reviews, I decided to watch.  Ugh.  I tried, but I couldn't even finish the movie.  I was bored out of my mind.  And I have a real problem with characters speaking directly into the camera and breaking the 4th wall - it's a cheap trick.  Turns out I don't like Ann Bancroft either, or at least I didn't like her character or the way she played it in this movie. I love books, too - but could not even like this movie.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Wish I could give this product ZERO stars.  I love and own all of the Harry Potter movies.  DO NOT BUY this version.  Ultraviolet Digital Copy is not a true digital copy - it is just a rented streaming copy that expires in 3 years.  You cannot save this copy on your computer or hard drive and it is not viewable on any iPad or iPhone unless you use the Flixster app to stream it (i.e. you must have an internet connection to watch it).  You must also create Ultraviolet and Flixster accounts to use this copy and download their software to view the rented copy.  DO NOT BUY.  DO NOT BUY.  Warner Brothers seems oblivious to the fact that this new service means piracy will only increase.    Provide a true digital copy and I will buy it.  I got duped on this one, but won't ever buy an Ultraviolet Digital Copy again.
B0051XQI84|5.0|I actually own this movie, but got a free voucher to watch it live on Amazon for my pre-order of Kung Fu Panda 2, so I went ahead and watched online.  Simply love this movie, and the 2nd one is just as good if not better!  I definitely recommend both!
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Other reviewers here have done a wonderful job detailing the winding road that this material has taken over the course of the last 40+ years.  I would like to simply add that this is a great addition to the Beach Boys catalog, and though I liked the Brian Wilson version of Smile from several years ago, these recordings will send chills up your spine.  To know that the vocals on this CD can never be replicated, and that the complex interplay of the Beach Boys voices will never be heard again, makes this a true testament of their vocal strength.  The Wilson brothers, with Love and Jardine and Johnston, created an amazing aural soundscape.  I am sure that Brian feels the loss of his brothers every day.  And this music shows what they were capable of.  I would also like to note that the Van Dyke Parks lyrics, though inscrutable, work in the context of the aural soundscape that Brian Wilson was creating.  Reading the words is somewhat pointless.  They are there to create images, to my mind much like the lyrics of Jon Anderson of Yes, which paint images much like the words of Smile.  In terms of the sequencing here, it is more clear now that Surf's Up is the pivotal song here, in which the joy of the first cuts gives way to a deeper, more mature attitude, bordering on the sadness of age.  I wouldn't call this a symphony to youth, more like a symphony of growing up.  In terms of the bonus cuts, the tracks on the first CD are the strongest, I believe.  The Vocals Montage section REALLY shows what Brian was trying to do here in creating his symphony.  Also, the solo version of Surf's Up is simply stunning.  And the uncredited bonus cut at the end of the first CD, the advertisement for Smile, shows just how much was riding on the unfinished masterpiece.  If you are a fan, you have to have this in your collection.
B005KMX866|5.0|For anyone who's a Chris Isaak fan or rock&roll fan, you should have this album.  It's more than a tribute album...it's a love letter to the early rock&roll era.  And only Chris Isaak and his band could do an album of this excellence and do this music and the original artists justice.  Listening to it is a joyful walk down memory lane...and i would say to Chris and the band, \\"Thank you for this gift\\"!
0061969656|5.0|Bernard Cornwell's \\"Death of Kings\\" is an immensely enjoyable book that brings to life the death of Alfred the Great and the ensuing struggle to form the English nation in the 9th Century. Cornwell brings ancient history into a colorful and exciting reality by weaving action, politics and war into events generally studied only in dry history books. His writing is simple, flowing and engaging--he connects the reader to Uhtred and you want to know him and his humanity, despite the brutal rule he must enforce as a warlord.   The story is told by the main character of Cornwell's Saxon Tales, the great pagan lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg. Saxon-born but Danish-raised, wearing Thor's hammer at his throat where those he serves wear crosses, Uhtred's straddling of both worlds allows him to tell a magnificent tale of bringing England to life. Uhtred both despises but admires the dying Alfred and swears his sword to his heir, Edward, thus tying his fate to that of the nascent English nation.    With Alfred the Great's death the fate of Wessex and Mercia is thrown into uncertainty as a new king takes the throne. Uhtred, with his fate now tied to the idea of England, must now outwit and outfight the enemies of his chosen homeland as they descend from the north of Britannia. A veteran of many campaigns, this feared and valiant warrior does not shy from becoming the sword of the Saxon nation. He meets the incoming Danish invaders, and the swords clash amidst the death of kings. Cornwell will keep the reader interested to the very last page.
0743289692|5.0|What an inspiration and hero Ms. Ali is for all women, whoever you are, wherever fate has cast your lot. The book is separated into two halves, Hirsi Ali's childhood growing up in various oppressive and dictatorial regimes throughout Africa and the Middle East, and what she terms 'her freedom', or the years after she ran away to begin a new life in Europe. Of course, reading about the political goings-on in Somalia during the 1970's and 1980's gave me an entirely new appreciation for a country I previously knew very little about. For this I am grateful; Hirsi Ali's book at the very least gave me a deep understanding about how the current humanitarian crisis and famine affecting Somalia came to be. As someone who greatly enjoys reading history, it was very engaging to read about the tyranny under Siad Barre, the SSDF resistance fighters to which Hirsi Ali's father was a member, and the eventual civil war that has caused utter lawlessness in that country, with no unified central government being able to take hold since 1991. As Somalia descended further into chaos, Ayaan Hirsi Ali grew up in a house with an absentee father, a devout Muslim mother who was very angry at the circumstances to which her life had manifested, abject poverty and war time and again, all the while being forced to relocate on a moments notice to places like neighbouring Kenya, Ethiopia, or Saudi Arabia. Each of these places presented their own unique set of challenges, and it is fascinating to read how Hirsi Ali navigated such a nomadic and turbulent childhood and adolescence, to varying degrees of success.   The second half of the book catches the reader up to the events of 2004 and how Hirsi Ali left her life (by that time back in Kenya) to escape an arranged marriage that her father had organized with a man in Toronto in the early 1990's (I shiver to imagine). After being sent to Germany to stay with relatives and await her Canadian visa, she ran to Holland to claim asylum after being confronted by some uncomfortable questions she really didn't have adequate answers to. For instance, she wonders how, if her Muslim faith was supposed to be some arbiter of privilege as 'the true believers', either in spiritual or temporal form, why is it that she and everyone she grew up with lived in a seemingly constant state of poverty and war, while people in Europe lived relatively comfortable lives, in safe communities with laws that were upholded by both government and people? Obviously, the answers to a question like this are myriad and complex, bound as they are in the vestiges of colonialism, racism, local corruption and tyranny etc., but in reading the book, one gets a sense of Hirsi Ali's awakening to the idea that life could actually be very different from the one she had previously accepted as fixed and inevitable. Here, she embraces (her critics argue far too naively), the tenets of liberalism and social democracy with an ardent ferocity and ultimately loses her religion. It is these sets of experiences that informs the reader on Hirsi Ali's current self-avowed atheism that is readily apparent in almost any media interview she gives these days.   Ultimately, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's book is as controversial as the lady herself. The uncomfortable memories her family would likely have preferred she kept quiet about, her evolving political beliefs from devout Muslim to liberal atheist, and her focus on the treatment of women globally, is bound to ruffle a few feathers. Though after the murder of Theo Van Gogh transformed her life into one that necessitates round the clock bodyguards etc., it would seem timidity is no longer a very meritorious option. Her critics argue that her admiration for the West is really just internalized racism but having read her book I disagree. I upsets me greatly to read some of the harsh comments made by insensitive reviewers (primarily male). Perhaps this woman threatens their masculinity--she certainly threatens their perspectives of power and control over women. I detest this sort of irrational anger and hatred in reviewers. I think it is impossible for anyone who grew up in the West to imagine coming of age in any war-torn, impoverished country and the perspective with which that must inform her life and her choices, cannot be discounted. I highly recommend this book as it appeals to such a cross-section of interests and people--not just women. I feel men would benefit even more. As the back cover of the book notes, in this age of globalization and transnationalism, where religious pressures routinely collide with democratic ideals, it goes without saying that this book couldn't be more timely or relevant.

B005HS4CUY|1.0|This 3 movies should be at least $30 cheaper than buying the 3 complete combos, for an extra $20 you get DVD Blu Ray 3DBLu Ray Digital copy and extra features, this item is just not worth it    [...]    I was just in time to buy this combo packs before their prices went up, got the 3 combo packs for $88 instead of lowering the first 3Dpack which i'm making the review of, amazon preffered to increase the prices in the separate packs
B004DK5CW4|2.0|This is truly a Disney movie.  A nice family movie as long as you don't know anything about horse racing.  The only thing that was accurate about this movie was that Secretariat won the Triple Crown!  The storyline is really about Penny Chenery's journey and I know they have to bend the truth a little to tell the story in a couple hours.  But, the true story is truly exciting; why screw it up so much?
