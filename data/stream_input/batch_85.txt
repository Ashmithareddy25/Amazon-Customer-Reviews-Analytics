B003L358Z0|5|great product  far better than all the other filters
B008X035IS|5|I got these as replacements for my 02' Ford Explorer XLT. The old coil springs were broken and shocks were shot.  They were easy to install and are holding up great after putting a few thousand miles on them.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to replace or fix theirs.
B00VNBDOV2|4|I just installed these bulbs in my 2011 Accord Coupe and they look great, visually from the exterior as well as the visibility. I got 2 pairs, one for the DRL/hi-beam and another for the lo-beam. I feel that the lighting is fuller, and more consistent. It was very easy to install and I like that the kit was complete, along with the slim controllers (didn't need to mount a large ballast). Great price point, although I wish that they came with a more enduring warranty (LEDs are supposed to be more reliable, so the warranty should cover the product for longer than just 2 years).
B00T9W255I|4|It will work just fine for the lower bottom of my motor home rear end.
B00EVYBXZM|5|The product is exactly what I expected and what you'd expect for the price.<br />Fits well on my Yamaha dragstar XVS650.<br />Excellent service from supplier. Delivered on time and when one rain cover was missing, contacted supplier's customer service who sent me one within 1 week.
B00842A7F4|5|At the local Honda dealer I was quoted $2.00 - $4.00 per piece I purchased 40 of these for that much. Can't beat this deal.
B0075XGZFO|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B0009H50VS|5|Great looking wax, has held up well for one month so far. I do a decent bit of driving, so I might add a reinforcing coat soon, but so far my car looks great!
B002TJTZ8I|5|Fit my 7-year-old​ perfect- easy for him to take on and off. Seems very durable.
B00MPAJ4CS|5|They are a little longer and thinner than the stock pieces they replaced. Easy to install and they are doing the job just fine. I'm curious to see what sort of product life they will provide. So far, I'm pretty pleased with the purchase.
B00CGGXQV6|5|Bought this for our new 2015 Silverado. Installation was easy and fits great.
B001Q6EE86|1|pump deliverd in june failed in augest. ran generator 4 times and pump started leaking from case.If i diddnt go down below for some ropes to tie something off i would have never known it was leaking and the situation could have been deadly.. Very dangerous situation would not recomend this pump to anyone ever!!!!
B00Z9ZEAUM|5|worked out great for rebuilding my 2011 mantis tiller carb
B00GSAUHB8|4|a lit bit hard to hold it in place.
B0007N5758|4|Works well.  Small bristles are very stiff.  Larger side of brush could be a little stiffer to really clean - they are soft enough that they don't really feel like they are doing quite the job they could, however, they do seem to do a better job cleaning hands than it feels like they are doing.
B00B8KHGXU|5|very good product and time to deivering
B00EVMT6A8|4|While the feature pages says these mirrors do not move, the title &#34;moving mirrors&#34; imply that they do. Besides that. These are very think mirrors that work very well. Just keep in mind because these are soo thin that if the glass portion of your mirror is semi recessed into the mirror housing, your blind spot mirror will show a fair amount of the mirror housing and not the road.
B00W4HGD3A|5|I glued them to my leather saddlebags on my Harley Davidson- Wow!  Looks great and I get a lot of comments about them.  Very nicely made- metal, very classey!
B0002JMD6I|5|This is the best car wash I've ever used. Far better than liquids.
B00E9G0GYQ|5|Met delivery date promised and product works perfectly!
B000COU4AU|5|Works well on Cobra R front air dam fasteners.
B00JF5HR7K|5|heavy duty and big.
B00OAC59P0|5|Good price and very well made!
B000B8VWP8|3|exact replacement for my old one I did run into a problem  when I returned one of two
B00M78820I|5|“ It fits the pickup window just fine and should help keep it cooler. I've had a similar shade (not yours unfortunately) for several years so I am<br />familiar with how it works. John is not at all familiar.  After he unwrapped it, he was trying to figure out how to unfold it when it suddenly &#34;exploded&#34;. It nearly knocked him out of his chair as he sent it sailing across our kitchen! It was our best laugh of the day. Too bad I didn't get it on film.”
B006WAMMDK|4|They look great so far, at least compared to torn leather! The fit could be a bit more snug in places, but I really don't have any complaints. Great price, decent quality...
B0072W6CXI|5|Product as advertised.
B00BITPYLC|5|'00 XJ 4.0 liter. fits great, works great. REALLY easy install.<br /><br />just remember to disconnect and re-connect your battery after the install to reset the computer. i was having some problems until i did this.
B00IR7DYME|5|These light bars are bright as ever!. I placed them on the side of the door frame when the doors are open, they make a great safety marker light. Since they are so thin, there are so many places you can place them. Earlier I got some white ones and placed them on the bottoms of the car doors so that when you open the door the grounds are well lite up. I find them ideal for placing them in areas that you really do not want too much sticking out to catch on something, like in the door frame. I keep thinking of more places I could put them, and I got ideas for my bike now!
B00RPGWE9C|5|Perfect fit, very happy with them.
B007DCCYJS|5|Looked great on my car!  Arrived on time.
B00XWUAOSS|4|Wish they were just a little brighter. All in all though they are great.
B003V54ZF2|5|Covers the cargo area in the back of the Venza.  Looks nice AND keeps the actual car carpet clean...
B000VKTUD2|5|Second time I've bought this filter. Fits perfectly in our 2008 Toyota Sienna.
B00EKTJ6TI|3|These didn't fit as well as i would have liked. There are gaps on the top of the covers that allow you to see under the covers.
B00W5EU3E2|4|Good quality heavy duty clamp. Too large and cumbersome. Ended up only using the piece that holds the remote. Very pricey for what it is
B00HS5S3F4|5|After deliberating the cause of brake fade in my 99 Dodge Dakota, I ventured to O'Reilly auto parts, to get a pair of vented and slotted rotors and pads, when I was told $178 per rotor, plus the cost of pads, I changed my mind lol. Then a few days later I was browsing Amazon to see these at $86 all in including delivery for the set a saving of over $300!!!, as a long standing Amazon customer, I thought I would give them a try. I received an email confirmation and also an email from Max Advanced Brakes confirming my exact vehicle details, which I duly answered. The email back came thanking me and that my parts would be shipped the following day, taking 10-14 days for delivery. My parts arrived within a week, looked great and nicely packaged, the rotors are sided and clearly marked L and R. I fitted these yesterday, also with a full set of new Monroe reflex shocks (also from Amazon, as I had saved so much on this kit lol), in about 2 1/2 hours total. They fitted perfectly, no noise or vibration whatsoever upon braking and my brakes have improved greatly. All I can say is I highly recommend these guys and their products, first class and thankyou.
B000WJ9JR4|5|Quick shipping perfect fit
B00HHNHK60|1|Beware of bogus It is not, as in the display in the picture is also not compatible with QX70S! Do not do purchase
B00LC8Q62K|5|They were kind of hard to do by one person two went well.
B001EVQVJI|5|Makes the removal of GM air bags easy. Wish I had purchased one of these tools long ago.
B004N63S9W|5|Worked as expected
B00H9K195E|5|Just what I needed to rewire two trailers with all new LED lights.
B00B4Y6T8I|5|Love the car mats.  Would definitely recommend
B0001EX1TW|5|They fit perfectly!  Love 'em!
B00EMO2X7S|5|Just the perfect emblem I was looking for. Much more sturdier than any other emblems that I have seen.
B0045L79IG|4|Read, don't trust picture
B0024E6QX0|5|Using these vent insulators really reduced the use of our propane in the generator.  It really kept the RV cooler.  Very glad I made this purchase.
B00GJ1HUB6|5|Worked perfectly. Took about half and hour to install and is a great direct replacement!
B001GMJHZ0|5|Look Awesome! Makes my Jeep with the 3.5&#34; lift and 35&#34; tires a whole heck of a lot easier to get in now.
B00N6D7SGC|5|very pleased
B003V8D7SK|4|best purchase. great fit!
B00E0FWPW2|4|nice sticker
B0043TVCCE|5|Very warm and worth it!
B0084IED5S|5|GREAT HAT !  I really enjoy it.  Thank  you.  :)
B004VRLC8M|5|Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!
B009U2P838|5|Arrived as promised<br />. Expected quality
B00EN7JOQC|5|EXCELENT
B000C7TW9Q|5|Tank arrived in a timely manner, installed easily into my '79 Continental; absolutely no problems whatsoever.
B000CF3WFI|5|Thank you!!! Very coSt effective
B005PCBOU8|4|The item was delivered In a timely and exactly as pictured
B00E90S4NM|5|Fit perfect
B0010DXYHW|5|Good
B000CLJTKE|5|The pads are great. No regrets.
B001KR79ZG|5|Works great
B00HP942US|4|Works well and fit on my 06 Honda. However, it should have come with some predrilled screws for the license plate to be attached.
B00Q7D2IPO|5|Great. Works just the way I expected
B003UT3S6Q|4|Excellent. Just came back from a road trip Chicago to Ft Lauderdale & back. The minivan looks bad especially the rims. After using Sonax they came out supper clean. I left it on less then 10 minutes and tried to be not in direct sunlight like it instructed. They look great. Can't wait to use on my car since I drive 70 mph a day. Now they look bad.
B00H7UR4QO|5|So easy to install my 15 year old son did it!!!!!
B005I4JQVC|5|fits great and  great price
B0016I8E1M|5|Super heavy duty, works great! It's the one to buy.
B00K68Q78K|4|want I needed
B00C7XZG34|5|Great l I be it thank you
B00H2VVL0S|4|Works on rust, don't bother to put it on painted surfaces - even if you want to go on a nearby painted surface adjacent to rust. It just doesn't stick.<br /><br />What it will stick to is your clothes, hands, face, hair, etc. If you're applying it to an underbody, make sure you don't have a wedding or important meeting to attend anytime soon.<br /><br />I'm up in the air about how well it starves rust too since I've had the rust come through again in painted areas, but it doesn't claim to be a miracle product.
B00OCBMFOM|3|WOULD HAVE BEEN A HIGHER RATING BUT NOT CAN-BUS SO I GET ERROR CODES WHEN SIGNALS ARE ON
B003XCHKFU|5|This is exactly what I wanted!  It was very easy to apply and is just perfect!
B006WEFFP8|4|Very good programmer. Was able to disable the afm (v4 mode) and the premium fuel tune Definetly gave it a kick. How ever it will not allow you to adjust shift firmness like it says. All in all its worth the 350 bucks.
B00BO3UTR6|3|Well pleased the liners are wonderful, shipped fast. Sorry I didn't buy the rear liners
B00EKTJOX6|5|Great product, perfect fit and shipped on time.
B00HSUD1W4|5|so love it, in honor of my nephew
B00BPC95PI|5|Very nice product!
B00XS6D1QI|5|Very nice.
B00407V5V2|3|Can be better
B00V4049K2|5|I recieved the PURGGO a few days ago and I didn't notice the difference until last night.  I went to In-N-Out and my son ordered Animal-Style Fries to go with his Animal-Style Double Double to go.  It was a 15 minute car ride back to the house which is enough time for the onion smell to take over the car.  When we got out of the car, it smelled like onions were sitting underneath the seats.  This morning, I stepped into my car to go to work and not only was the smell gone, but the air quality seemed to be better too.  The air felt more crisp and light.  I'm definitely going to be buying another PURGGO in a year.
B0043063JU|4|Nice mat for outside our RV
B000I4JPZE|5|Makes changing a flat tire easy, doesn't slide
B00CAX6LJ4|5|worked like advertised, follow the instruction closely and you will not have a problem.
B000VAVT0Y|5|working well after a year
B00651CLCS|3|I love the look but the service sucks , I always have to plug in my phone.
B00CPAR57Y|5|Great synthetic oil for my 2012 M3.
B0072RGJFY|5|Perfect
B00FTDJ9FA|5|I have several VW's and Audi's that monitor all the onboard lights and alert you if one is out. This can be a problem with some LED lights. I can say I have never had a problem related to the JDM ASTAR LED lamps. I have purchased dozens of these bulbs for my cars and will continue to do so. They give a very white, clean, color that is a huge improvement over the &#34;yellow&#34; color from the original OEM bulbs. I am impressed with the range of bulbs available since some auto bulbs can be a little strange.
B00P99KKAM|5|high quality cover. Made in America.
B002UYP8F6|5|ARC reman parts work period
B00LDNKHBK|4|Good
B00B466198|4|Works good
B00N3B7TT8|5|I was a bit dubious about the light output of these. However when I hooked them up I was amazed. The light output was incredible from these small units. They blend nicely with the bike and are very obvious when blinking. The finish is excellent. For anyone doing custom work on their bike or just wanting to improve over the stock units I would definitely recommend these. You will have to replace the flasher relay to ensure the correct flashing rate however if swapping from incandescent bulbs, but that is normal.
B00BGCSAOY|5|Though these don't have Kevlar in the seat, they're a thick jean material which helps some with safety protection (the knees are reinforced). Just nice jeans. Pay attention to sizing recommendations as they do run large.
B002OL7ZB0|5|Well made and very cute
B001PBHQ3W|5|Excelent product!!!
B009EFWERY|5|As expected it looks just as it was in the picture... Very satisfied...
B003WL73OK|5|I received a &#34;new&#34; genuine bosch pump with a helicoil on the inlet
B0073W7F9W|1|well, I double-checked the pulldown menu to verify that I did in fact have 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee selected, but the Stubby that I got in the mail today did not fit the threads on my Jeep. So that's as far as my review goes.<br /><br />I'm going to split the difference between this one and the factory by opting for the 13&#34; off road antenna that has been getting better &#34;reception&#34; reviews anyway.
B00M47Q3QC|3|Works but, very squeaky!
B000C5CEKC|4|Works okay, but a year later it stopped spinning freely when locked. Now the ratcheting mechanism works &#34;jerky&#34; or roughly.
B00849PSDS|5|fits
B00062YZXU|3|too thick so it isn't very clear.  good quality
B002DOME1E|5|I bought these Hook and Loop SoftWraps not realizing that the Softride Access Element Bike Rack included 4 of them.  They keep the front bike wheel from spinning when it's loaded on the bike rack.
B000COBK8A|5|Excellent product. A great upgrade from the wimpy stock horns used in Asian cars.
B00M9DCMNE|5|Not installed yet. Worked great on a bench test.
B009DPP6QQ|1|Could not get it to work, even after the upgrade. Had to return. Turbo 6O diesel is what I attempted to use it on
B00NA2TQFK|5|My daughter is gonna love it. They are real nice
B001KQ43RE|5|The product was a drop in replacement for my '88 Camaro, some of it was an extremely tight fit, but other than that it works well!
B001PWFPRU|2|I tried to install this on a 2002 Dodge Ram 2500 but it does not fit this model.  I don't believe that I'll be able to modify either the device or the tailgate to allow it to work.
B0010XQ9JC|4|Very nice golden yellow, Pretty yellow highbeams that light up the road signs very nicely on the dark backroads with no streetlights.
B005ESTLHG|5|Excellent Products
B0087NB3S0|5|Shipped fast, works well
B009MATM3U|5|Great product.
B001U60T9U|5|Awesome.  Looks great fit my Honda Accord.  But the split system for the back won't work any Honda our seats in the rear don't go from end to end. Therefor with cover on you can never flip down bank seats.  Which isn't a big deal for me. Or you could just not use the top of the seat cover.
B00CTNQMKI|4|This net works well in my 2015 Subaru Forester....I wish they had included instructions, it would have been easier to install if they had.
B004MB2F9W|5|Well finished.  Works a whole lot better than a pair of pliers.  A lot easier.
B000CQVLV4|5|I have these pads front & back. They work great can't beat the price.
B005P3K1FG|5|it is a great tool for all hot jobs.that is high tempreture jobs
B00IZMYPSI|3|Appears to be good, but one simple page of instructions would be much appreciated.  I had no idea the plastic cover was just for shipping, ended up smoking up the housing, and slightly damaging the bulb.  All of that could have been saved if there was one simple page of instructions for installation.<br /><br />I should have known better, I have only been in business since 1993 doing public safety 12 volt installs and wiring.
B008YC8FYY|5|was not the same as original unable to use.
B00KTHU1QM|5|Fast shipping, like factory product. Took about 3 minutes to program both remotes and worked perfectly.
B00DSGI9JC|5|very nice
B001RBCU90|5|High quality decal.  Very happy with my purchase,.
B009FPQMO4|1|This listing shows three pieces to this &#34;3D&#34; liner.  I received one rather flimsy piece that did not fit very well.  I had read several websites that were selling this liner and between them I somehow got the idea that the various pieces would provide some protection to the seat back when folded down.  Does not happen.  It only covered the cargo area under the seats where I have no need for protection.  The liner was much different from the photos in their listing.  I would not only not purchase this item in the future but will avoid the maker of this liner with future purchases.<br /><br />I must give Amazon FIVE STARS for their painless return procedure.  I have bought many items from Amazon and only found it necessary to return two as I recall.  This will be the third in three years.  It could not be easier.  About 20 minutes after receipt, I had the liner boxed and ready for UPS to pick up for return.
B008FZ68Q2|1|Sorry to say it because it looks great but it was like there was no antenna on the car when I installed it.
B00U6W85WC|5|Exact fit part.  What else can I say…  took the old tank out and put the new one in.  A 15 minute repair.
B003AOEAHC|5|works great. does not move, flop around, etc... the straps are a little long, but overall a great solution for mounting a fire extinguisher.
B001KVW6EQ|5|Haven't had a chance to use it yet, however, it makes me feel secure knowing that if I need one, I have one and don't have to hassle the flight attendant for one!
B0060MZBOW|5|Great replacement park for Jetta. Looks clean . I recommend
B001RMTY8E|4|More of what was in the spray bottle
B002AK2RU4|5|nice light,
B00IITYW0Y|2|These look like a good idea but the mud/dirt sits in the grooves and shows against the black rubber.  Worse yet is doesnt wash out easily.  Unless you like taking a brush to these boards daily or happy just having them look like crap, dont buy them.
B003DNL8ZC|3|The cover fits well, is made out of a nice sturdy material, but the problem is having it stay on the car when it gets windy. It does have a couple of grommets to tie a cord from either side of the cover under the car, but that still leaves the front and the back of the car without anything heavy enough to prevent it from billowing and eventually, just coming untucked. Since we put it on the car, a couple of months ago, it has needed to be re-placed on the car at least six times. :(
B0009JKGEW|4|Done a good job my car is shining
B000C48XMQ|3|This pump came doa, but I got another one to replace, and that one has been working no issues, just make sure to be careful pulling and putting on the pulley.
B0007N5758|5|My wife thanks you.  Now she doesn't have to be embarrassed by the dirt under my fingernails after I've been in the garden.
B00SK49JNM|5|Great thanks
B005O0QQ1S|4|I no longer worry about decapitation while driving! This seat belt extender is high enough to keep my seat belt off my neck while driving. I have tried various clips to lower the belt and they work temporarily but are always slipping off. This extender is wonderful.
B00EV7DADC|4|Very good protection for the front differential. Been through some rocky blue and black trails, and it worked well. The manufacturer doesn't know how to properly package and ship these products such that they arrive without damage, but some black paint fixed that.
B00VB2OJLW|5|Products was what I was looking for.
B00AFV7DHW|5|Great product, fits perfect, blends in well and looks like OEM, a little shaky on rough highways.
B004GFS2C8|5|Worked fine. Will buy again.
B00CJYU9I8|5|My second Sunshade.  Fit and finish are excellent. They are truly tailor made to your windshield dimensions.  Stows away easily with the attached velcro strap.  Simply the best. Highly recommended.
B00493WGZQ|5|Part looks, operates, and fits like the original. I bought a less expensive one from Detroit Axle and it had to be replaced twice within a few hundred miles (they hummed while going down the road from the first mile after installation). No problems with the AC Delco, should have bought these first.
B00B5PHW3W|5|Fit like a glove only had to reuse one bolt but now my parking brake is working. Last cable was really stretched out.
B005O97PVE|5|Pretty fast, good quality and easy to install!...thx
B004R322HK|5|Wiring doesn't get any easier. Simply plug it in everything works. I was very pleased with this. I installed on a 2010 Subaru forester.
B00EC0YXO8|5|fit as described. Good product
B000CH8E0O|5|Installed easily, performed smoothly and quietly.
B00085F51G|2|did not work at low pressure for an RO bladder tank
B00HVHUKKK|5|worked great
B004AVJQI2|5|Love it!! looks great on my 70 mustang Rat rod!
B003XWXW7K|5|great product, a little hard to put on but gave my car a whole new look. thank
B000NVW1LM|5|Best of the products out there.
B00P99KKAM|5|Got a new car that I'm really happy with but felt the vibration from the steering wheel become uncomfortable during my long drives. I've been using this cover for two weeks and even a day trip of 600 miles. Very comfortable and smooth.
B0012DPTAK|5|Works very well. There's defiantly a difference in temperature. Fits well...
B002M2MMXM|4|Great price and they are doing the job.  Quick delivery
B00JAMYDFC|3|I would say it's a mild cleaner.  Don't expect it to tackle mildew.
B000BPTU14|5|Good product!
B007PLQYXO|5|Perfect!
B0076SO3VG|5|Very nice stickers for the price. Instructions are in the package so that's a plus. I can say I was satisfied.
B008UR7J6I|4|guuud
B0042ORWQK|1|Made in Taiwan. Only lasted 2 weeks before the motor burned out.
B00NMVREIU|5|guuud
B0013T5V6K|1|For a Vacuum that's a deal breaker
B00U9OOAU8|5|I was surprised to see it was such good quality, it came fast as well. I'll by again of something happens to the one i have now
B0002Z9NGK|5|Thank you
B00BXMRP4I|5|Good product for what I used it for
B001TWD5GY|5|This is the second set I have owned (2 different trucks), and I won't hesitate to buy them again. They come with everything you need, and are super bright. I use mine as a supplement to my bright lights, and it lights up the road like it is noon!<br /><br />They are also very good looking. They add that little bit extra to the look of my truck
B00WOXYNOA|5|Excellent
B004LF14Q4|5|very ez to install/  I put it in a trailer i built myself and was very ez to install and hook up 12v system, 120 outlets and battery charger.
B001AMC8LG|5|fit and are strong shocks
B000IYYFKO|3|I wish these kits would include the caliper clips -- or that the pad kits would just include these pieces in the first place.
B002Z3113K|5|I just placed my order for 1 of the two remaining jack stands in stock. I purchased my first pair from a local well known national retail tool supplier. For some reason the store no longer sells these jack stands.<br /><br />Yes. The jack stands are, in fact, sold as a pair. The stands are ideal for any SUV, Pickup Truck or cars.<br /><br />I use the stands at the lowest height setting as this gives adequate height (and great stability) for most maintenance work and much of repair work encountered. Being able to use the locking safety pin at the lowest height is one on the reasons why I bought the stands.<br /><br />The pair that I bought from the a local retailer I have owned for the past 4 years with no problems whatsoever. The welds are perfect. Neither stand has warped at all from use on a 7,500 pound SUV.<br /><br />Some stands that are &#34;rated&#34; as 6 tons (3 tons for each stand) are actually overrated, meaning that the stands are not designed to hold nearly as much weight. With these Omega 6 ton jack stands, you can safely place 4,500 - 5,000 pounds on each jack stand without concern the legs will bend. Each stand is rated at 6,000 pounds. However, for safety measures, I would limit the maximum per stand at 5,000 pounds (or slightly less).<br /><br />I ordered the second pair here at Amazon so that I can have 4 stands (all equal in height, etc.) to place a front-wheel drive car my wife and I own on 4 stands  to change the oil, etc.. I simply do not trust having the front two wheels in the air on a front wheel drive vehicle, even with the rear wheels blocked and the emergency brake set.<br /><br />Another reason I prefer using 4 stands is that many front wheel drive cars, today, are &#34;unibody&#34; type frames, unlike most or all SUVs and Pickup Trucks that have full frames. As such, I prefer using two jacks as with the Arcan 3 Ton aluminum low profile floor jack to lift one side for placement of the jack stands. Then the opposite side doing the same with two more jack stands. Jacking up one corner of a 'unibody frame' vehicle tends to cause the body to flex. Doing one side at a time, using 4 jack stands at the designated points recommended by the factory avoids the body flexing.
B0016VIUU4|5|This fits perfectly in my 2011 Tundra with a 6.5 foot bed.  I have a Linex bed liner but I preferred to have a bed mat as well.
B000W1T5QM|5|ok in time , good quality
B00HWCORCG|5|good decals. good price. very pleased
B0028QVNGO|1|The protective seal for the eyes is already coming loose.
B007227BU6|5|A great American product made by a great American company look forward to the next time to do trade with Fuse Powersports
B001NAP2D6|5|fits perfectly
B0002Z9QO4|5|This is our third year using this bag. We use it for annual camping trips to pack extra luggage. This has been a great purchase. Straps are made to easily tie to rack if you have one or to put onto the top directly. Material is very sturdy. Over our last three trips we did not have to bear fierce rains but moderate rain was handled with no water getting in. Looks like this will last another 7-8 trips easily which is great value.
B000CPJIMO|5|nice
B002R0I30U|1|would not plug in to my harness.
B008ECC48W|4|Heck of a price compared to the dealer.  I think (??!?!?) Denso is the OEM manufacturer for Toyota anyway.<br /><br />One plastic part in the original was NOT on the back of this!! It wasn't necessary and did not affect it. It may have just been a model change from 2012.
B007ZGDEO6|5|Easy to install using the included step by step instructions with pictures. The only issue I had was with trying to find and remove the final resonator bolt under the battery tray, behind the bumper. The longest part was removing and replacing the bumper.
B00NCTS7P6|4|This is a great purchase! I just underestimated how often I drop my phone. So if you are clumsy then maybe this isn't a item for you
B001GBJVDO|1|the model number was wrong for the connection I needed and so was the second one that I ordered,. y'all need to work on that.... Found the correct one elsewhere
B00UGJ1LMG|5|+++++++++ Would buy this mount for all my karts and it does fit my 2002 margay brava 1.2 without any mods
B00KTIUG5C|5|These worked great no complaints
B000N3482K|5|great price and shipping!
B001DKSVB6|5|fits
B007DBNM2M|5|Looked great on my car!  Arrived on time.
B00OCEGONC|3|the pump did not last long
B00PIWSORG|5|Love the bubbleshield it illuminates the road  so much the amber thankyou i will be ordering more.
B002YKFA3G|5|This is a good quality remote start switch. It has a comfortable grip and a positive press button, nice 5' long leads which are well insulated, decent spring clips with proper soldered connections, and a red indicator light to show the circuit is hot. The leads are also separate, the switch mechanism I'll bet has a good power rating, and there's even a 'use only in neutral' warning near the button ha. OTC think of everything. This is a high quality tool which should last a very long time when used correctly on starter motor solenoids (don't connect it to ground, or inline between battery and main starter motor terminal, across the battery terminals, etc). Not sure what 'Made in USA with globally sourced components' really means, but I'm pretty sure those components are from China like most everything else OTC. Still a good tool for a good price, so I'm not complaining. A guard for the press button (like Snap-On) would have been nice though.<br /><br />btw. remote starter switches are mostly not used to actually 'start' an engine, but just to crank it over eg. when performing a cylinder compression test. They are not really intended for inching a crankshaft around to set valve clearances (but if that works for you.. fine).<br /><br />Recommended for sure.
B00HEB2XEO|5|It was much better than the original plastic ones which for some reason disintegrated. The installation was very easy. The only issue I had, though no fault of the product itself, was I had to pull the electrical connection to the vanity mirror light to disconnect it, and it won't go back in again when I reconnected it.
B0007IJR22|4|Fine, hard to get excited about car wash soap.  Smells like cherry cough syrup, that's neither a plus or minus.  Reasonably sudsy.  Seems to take a lot of it to produce a bucket of suds, more so than common dish soap.
B0009IK5XA|4|new blades streak, have cleaned and re-cleaned glass and blades, still streaking
B0074DFTKM|5|easy install on a 2007 Ford Edge. working great for almost a year now.
B0012TYNY2|5|A handy bag for alot of small items.
B000OUZCUE|5|I do car stereo. This is small but its hella handy! I had a bigger one but it can be hard to set it anywhere cause everything sticks to it. I lost my keys for half a day. They were on the bottom of it!
B00QLPYTQO|5|Gift for my daughter, best gas cans we own and we have 5 now.<br />no safety caps that break apart
B00O5UFNEO|3|Not as big as it should be.<br />Doesn't totally cover the 86 Kawasaki Voyager.<br />It's like 10lbs of stuff in a 8lb bag.......<br />I wish it was bigger.<br />But it's better than nothing.
B00BAZCRRS|5|Good product for the money
B00P8BL2KI|4|Nice part and priced rite
B007Y866BS|5|Great price super fast shipping
B000COSFRO|5|It's a Monroe strut, worked great out of the box.  Only complaint is the included nut for the top was larger than my original nut, and I couldn't get a socket onto it.  My old nut was in fine condition though and worked great.
B0081ZZTOS|5|Great covers for my classic cars when I work on them
B001OMPJGS|5|This is a fantastic upgrade for your jeep!  Much brighter!
B005RQWB18|4|I order a set of TC Blue led interior lights, came in pretty fast, it said it would take 7-10 days, got it in 5. All the lights are working, pretty easy to install. The only thing, I didn't like was that I got 2 wrong colors and that was for my dome and trunk, which were Red Leds
B00OW0NQGE|1|Had only a few days not as sturdy as i hoped for it broke. The pins that hold leather strap in fell out.
B000GTTOMA|5|This item was shipped quickly and works great
B00VENO1MK|5|Faith , Hope, Love...it says it all.  It displays nicely on the car.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Perfect for my 2002 Mazda Millenia!
B00C3OCSMO|4|Good item in excellent quality, would buy again!
B003O72GD0|5|Great fit, easy to install.
B0045MGTG8|5|Fast shipping great item
B0046ID5EK|5|Great replacement.  Easy and fast to program
B00BITJUGW|3|I broke my original door handle trying to hope my door during a freezing rain storm (big mistake).  This worked ok as a replacement, my only complaint is that it didn't fit back into the spot like my original handle did, it was about 1/16 inch off so it sat a little slightly down than my original handle.  I fiddled with it quite a bit to make sure I wasn't doing anything wrong, and finally gave up.  It's working fine though.
B00HJA097S|5|it work
B001EOV45G|5|Blank face without advertising manufacturer.  This is a more clean look on my JEEP since my wheels already have MOTO METAL.  I don't want my vehicle looking like a bill board. Fits great.
B00D3O5LUO|5|Excellent product. Generac generator started immediately with new battery. The price was great manufacturer wanted $105 plus tax and shipping. This battery is made by generac and cost a total of under $35 reciieved within a few days.
B00WFHXVAW|5|No lie, its worth it. if you follow the directions that come with the package, you won't regret it. best to do before you go to bed. -  disconnect the negative terminal on your battery. splice into the two wires for your intake air. wait over night, reconnect your negative terminal. i felt the difference immediately. and its not placebo. i had 3 different people take a drive with me, and before mentioning anything they all asked if i did something else to my car.
B0068OB934|5|Worked great!
B00A229E6W|5|Nice
B000JYHGR2|5|Excellent
B000HBNX38|5|works great
B0002F9YIC|4|Works well to quickly clean my horse tack.
B00H6XPZN6|4|The suction cups came off after a day of moderate driving. Besides that it's very useful to protect your kids against the sun coming in.
B00BUV2SGC|5|great
B008CE0TN4|5|This is a great product that makes moving a trailer easy as could be.
B004GW3OO2|5|Met my requirements.
B001GD3O8A|5|This cover is of high quality, heavy-duty but not too stiff, and fits perfectly over every part of the vehicle. Glad we ordered it.
B00M169UKW|5|Installed on my 2013 Ford Fusion 1.6l, was an easy job, removed the old filter from its compartment behind the glove box then slid the new Wix filter in, you may have to apply a little force as it seems to catch once it gets about 2/3 the way in, but overall went in easy.  (I actuall had to slide it in twice due to not paying attention to the air flow arrow the 1st time, it went it quite easy the 2nd time).  So far so good on the air quality, the musty small is now gone when the A/C kicks on.  If anything changes I'll revise, but so far so good.
B00B8KHGUS|5|very good product and time to deivering
B00D90PFBM|5|Love it!!!
B00TXI5CQW|5|remote worked with no problem programming the instructions  but the print of the instruction was faded had to use magnifying glass to read
B000UVDNQM|4|Nice
B00X4AXGCC|5|Great price and the product came quick. Will order more in the future.
B00A5BNOKM|1|Fell off on the first adventure.
B00P2D3W0A|1|Will not stay connected, the connectors on the lamp are too flimsy and will not keep a connection
B007QBQEOW|1|Alternator suddenly died 5 months into operation, low quality and ineligible for return at this point, totally unacceptable for a modern component to fail so early and for the customer to have such little recourse
B008R13Z3S|5|Used it for installing a new compensator. Great product.
B00WRI8LFE|5|Better than I expected.. Really nice
B00FQ0ROZS|3|lower quality than PENTON at same $
B003VWXVN2|5|Replacement for a 2002 Suburban.  The only difference was that the original frame has the bottom bolts welded in place.  The replacement unit has nuts.  Simple solution is to remove the two bolts used to clamp the window from the factory frame and use them for the nuts in the bottom of the replacement frame.<br />This is a very simple replacement even for the less mechanical.
B00473V668|5|Worked well with my light bar
B001QK1X5O|4|works great, hope it keeps the crooks away..
B00CBILLPW|4|Living in the midwest, I ride from March until December.  So I need at least 3 pairs of gloves depending on the season (hot, cool, and cold).<br /><br />I had trouble finding gloves for cool weather until I found these.  They are extremely comfortable and are the best I've found for cool weather riding into the high 40 degree range or a little lower.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that after one season they are starting to unravel in spots like the velcro attachment.  I expect to get a total of 2 or 3 seasons out of them.
B005VVW6DM|5|Perfect fit good price
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Awesome and simple product! I was able to easily apply to the window and it did the job we needed without hassle. There's only the window shade and no other gadgets to worry about. I have tried the suction cup shades and they break so easily. This one is great.  Love it!
B00J52R3AE|4|This is a great little portable receiver.  We do a lot of camping and use one of our home receivers and it works great!  The only down side is that it is only Standard Definition with Direct TV receivers - HD receiver will NOT work with this dish.
B004KW4SDO|5|This is a great fuel pump. I called Thursday and talked with HFP and they advised me on which pump best fit my 1997 Camaro Z28 and the goals I had for the car. The fuel pump install is simple with basic hand tools and comes with all necessary hardware that all fits well. The car had not been started in 2.5 years so I primed the fuel lines 3 times by turning the key to the on position, the car then started on the first time it was cranked over. Its virtually silent. The fuel pump is self regulated and good for up to 500hp. The only con that I wish would have been included was some sort of instruction packet. A little guidance for DIYers would be fantastic. Fast shipping as well. Nonetheless, feel confident buying this pump especially with the lifetime warranty through HFP.
B00YCKHCAU|5|This helmet was for my husband and he loves it.  It fits good.  I'm thinking about ordering one for me.
B001GDJGJQ|5|Perfect!
B001PNE8YA|5|Perfect
B00AQ47JEA|5|it worked fine I just installed them on 08/16/15. Thank you.
B00469HNR4|5|Great, thanks A+
B00JSDET98|2|As others have pointed out, the windshield channel fits horribly.  I managed to get it secure against the rubber seal, but it is really cheesy.  Then the biggest surprise....When I went to fasten the straps, I noticed something odd.  The straps on each side were different!  On the driver side they sewed the center column straps on the rear and the rear strap in the center.  Absolutely no way to make that work without a little ingenuity.  Managed to make do with a strap I happen to have laying around.  I should have returned it, but needed it for the weekend and didn't have time for the hassle.  Do they even know what QA is?  I will not buy another Smittybuilt product again.
B000C2E4OO|5|I would recommend it
B007D7QOH6|4|The fitment is correct however the instructions were not the best.  I tried to follow them on the first one and it went badly however I ignored them on the 2nd and the install went fine.
B006QGD996|5|DID THE JOB
B00MVBP1QO|4|Very helpful in the Texas heat.  I wish they came in gray or tan.
B0054LD2ZA|5|Perfect fit and the template was excellent. Just FOLLOW the directions (which were simple.)<br />I put it on my Blizzard white Venza. Protects and adds that bit of upgrade class which accents an already classy lined crossover.  To bad 2015 is the last year they will be making the Toyota Venza.
B00T60P4U6|3|Aluminum... Not steel. But the color's nice.
B007IDI3E2|5|Great shipping on time the item is strong and nice black color I am happy with them thanks guys
B005P5DT6M|5|i love it!<br />my wife has a different cover, and it is far more difficult to operate, and a pain to install
B004I10IN6|4|So happy that it fix perfect.
B00QW4WF2Y|5|Does as advertised---will buy again.
B006K8GPHI|3|The rags are thin as others have noted and I do not expect them to stand up to many repeated uses.  Also, as others have stated, wash them 2x BEFORE you use them to help minimize the dye and pilling that they give off.  For those two reasons I give them three stars.
B000NW8H3C|5|Exactly what I was looking for!  Never thought I would of found it on Amazon out of all places but I'm very glad I did.  Works perfect and fits just right.  Thank you!!
B00YRLWD9O|5|This keychain arrived quickly from the seller, in excellent condition. It feels sturdy, looks high quality--a combination of nice leather and silver. The mechanism that holds and releases a single key ring feels exceptionally well made; I can't see it wearing/breaking down easily. I like this set up because it allows me to take just my house key in the event I leave the house and am not the driver and vice versa. I am pleased with this purchase.
B00RM327NG|5|I've only used the sticker magnet, not the one that goes under the case. It works great, the phone stays upright and doesn't slide around.
B00KC9HIG8|5|It was what I expected nothing less and nothing more.
B00X1LNOTE|3|The suction was not as strong as I expected.
B004AHFXCE|5|This is the correct filter for a Harley Davidson Twin-Cam (maybe others).  Fit my 2001 Dyna properly.  Run WIX in everything.
B000C5EACC|5|Worked great. Got 170° for my car.used my existing rubber gasket and silicone on the housing. U dont need another gasket plus i didnt see it here on amazon for an 02 Q45 .No leaks
B008G3K76K|5|These replacement headlamp assemblies from Autoandart are the real deal! The fit and look are great. Comparing side by side with the originals you can not tell the difference between the two lenses, except new looking vs worn and scratched of course! These come with all new bulbs and install in minutes. These do not come with new mounting bolts, but did not expect them any way. These were for an 2004 Chevy Express and if you're ordering for the same vehicle, you won't be sorry you saved a few bucks and received and excellent replacement part. Oh and the best part for the price? You get both sides, just unbelievable at this price and quality. Thanks Autoandart and Amazon for quality parts and excellent service!
B00IKSRTBM|4|Quick and easy to install and work great!
B005BNYVWY|2|The tape was nice but if you live where it's hot don't bother. I live down in Phoenix and put it on a ramp for my motorcycle. Cleaned it quite thoroughly and the next day the tape had peeled off and was on the ground.
B00X8DE6ZG|5|just what i expected
B00AFV7DI6|5|I'm very happy with these clip on mirrors as they extend my view so that I can see down the sides of the travel trailer, making backing it up a charm. Additionally they fit like a glove and from the front of the vehicle they look like factory mirrors. When I'm finished I just pop them off and store them til next time.
B00070FJL8|5|easy to install an very patriotic
B00MGSNA6K|5|Perfect OEM part.
B004A0ICOW|3|I made these fit my 2006 Honda Pilot.  The original left and right wheel speed sensors are a little different in length of cable between anchor points.  These were advertised as the same part for left or right front.  I assumed they were built with extra length for either side.  This is not the case.  I bent the mounting gussets on the car here and there to get enough cable length to fit on the left front unit.  The right front unit is an ideal fit as is.
B0036R6IT6|5|There outstandingng and waterbtighteness
B00V7WG0MW|3|the color was even lighter than it looked on the website.<br />I need a dark blue, not blue
B00YEEZUR6|5|Love them!!!
B00FF376WC|1|Picture of a chrome unit and a black unit sent. another chrome unit bought off ebay for 1/2 price.
B000E8X42Y|1|Junk, 2 for 2 knock, replacement no better than original!!<br />Amazon warranty policy goes in circles, from retun then product not eligableto return.<br />very,very frustrating buying experience. .
B001JT77BG|5|Plenty of length on both ends..
B002KOLR06|1|Ok when ordering this I was under the impression it was a full front brake line kit.... It was not. They sent a single brake line. Now if it was a single line only how would they know which one I wanted?  So I got a random single brake line.... Kinda waste of time since I was looking to upgrade both lines.
B00VH643H2|5|These white towels work wonders to me.  When I am cleaning my car mind you I have a white car I tend to notice my car staying off white even after I cleaned it. But, when cleaning my car and using these towels I actually can see the notice that my car is a brighter shade of white. I also like using these towels around my house great for cleaning indoors also. They are very durable towels I have washed them and the stiching has not come loose and  the towels have not discolored. Overall these towels are a great durable product with many uses.<br /><br />*Disclaimer I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.
B0030MWMMO|1|Quality was good . The item didn't fit my 2007 Impala so I had to send back
B00C070NAI|4|Easy to install. Controls are kind  of intuitive.<br />PRoblem is with all the cables. I donlt know how to hide them in the car.
B00UICCQGQ|5|Loved this for my car.  Been using it for the last two years.
B0066CIDR8|5|Best spotlight I've ever owned. Highly recommend it.
B0000AY3X0|5|The absorber works Great for drying my truck after washing!
B00MWAQAGO|5|Excellent quality and fit!
B00A757S76|5|Looks great in our kitchen. Quite a good value considering the engineering, style and design. I agree that you would not want this in a bedroom, it does make some noise, but barely noticeable in our kitchen.
B00H4G6WOQ|5|Very good product, everything was as described!
B00AZ4QE06|1|Not good at all didn't fit my 08 gmc canyon crew cab like it said and is not in channel either. ....<br />Didn't even get asked if i wanted a new set... not happy with company at all still waiting for a call to see if they will do wright by me....?
B00PUI2BAE|5|it was perfect fit and my helmet is back and going. fast delivery seeing it is coming from Korea
B00Y64TCQO|5|This product works awesome and shipped quickly. This fit my Subaru Legacy B4 RSK 1999.
B00URS6MCA|5|I'm happy and very satisfied
B00NFA8KOK|1|3 out of 4 ballast didn't work and the one that does work, works intermittently (have to cycle the head light switch)
B005LVZ9YK|5|Awesome!
B00F23BNUG|5|I have several VW's and Audi's that monitor all the onboard lights and alert you if one is out. This can be a problem with some LED lights. I can say I have never had a problem related to the JDM ASTAR LED lamps. I have purchased dozens of these bulbs for my cars and will continue to do so. They give a very white, clean, color that is a huge improvement over the &#34;yellow&#34; color from the original OEM bulbs. I am impressed with the range of bulbs available since some auto bulbs can be a little strange.
B000BO56JU|5|Excellent product.  A little bit goes a long way!
B002C0I9PY|5|awesome
B000CSOLU0|5|Item exactly as described.  Works perfectly on my old Chevy inline six cylinder engine.
B008E9110W|2|The color seems to be blue not cool white, and when you remove the plastic cab that covers the led light, you will smell something burns, you will see noticeable smoke as well. It's wasn't bad but I expected much better.
B00FGR8VVW|1|Saw the 8mm thread bolts and figured they'd fit on my 2010 Wide Glide. Got free shipping on them and it's gunna cost almost just as much to return them as the price of the mirror. Not too mention they are plastic and the mirror feels as if it's going to fall out.
B000COX0MY|5|Now this seems like a good idea.  We will se how it holds up in the mud and snow.
B00TTO6PKC|1|Thought I was ordering the entire assembly until recieved just the door.
B0074OL2I4|4|I installed it in this weekend. Looks good on my Honda Pilot 2012<br />I strongly suggest, &#34;DO IT BY YOURSELF&#34; and you will not be disappointed and that will save you $100<br />Instructions are available online and this should be done in 2 hours with help of friend in hot summer by beer on your friend side.
B00JSP9EN2|5|Fits & looks great
B00JF5F420|1|I have a 2008 GMC Yukon with 22&#34; rims and locking lugs (Gorilla Brand I believe) and this did NOT work at all. If you have lugs with grooves that are evenly spaced out this will probably work and if you have locking lugs with grooves that are not evenly spaced out this will NOT work. I'm not sure why they call this a master set as I highly doubt it fits all locking lug nut brands and types out there. It will probably fit 80% of the brands and types out there but I sure didn't fit mine. After searching for a solution to my problem for over a month this still wasn't the answer. Now I've wasted my time with this product and I'm still no closer to getting these things off.
B00T4BVZHS|5|Exact replacement of the Plastic Gearbox with more durability!!
B00WOY33EA|1|sounds good on paper but they don't work very well . Save time and money by getting OEM replacements.
B000MK2C6S|4|The other review was right about a few things. The install sheet was a joke. The fit for the mass air flow was harder then it should have been. Even a hair longer bolts would have helped a lot. After a bit of trimming I finely bolted it up. Once that was done the box dropped right in. It would have been nice to have mounting ears but it does fit snug. Now for the good part. It works. Their is some noise but nothing like a K&N. It made a huge difference and no codes.
B00P7QPZLQ|5|I really like this light it works good night or day time the cord is to short for the top of my  car I orderd a longer cord I work Security work with the green light works good the light will be good for construction Amber real good
B00W67TI9Y|5|Im not sure what size my bar is but they were a tight fit. They look great, work great, and are way cheaper then most pegs
B006XG6D24|5|Great deal, looks amazing. Very easy to swap in. Biggest challenge was finding a mounting plate. Ended up buying one off eBay from Hong Kong for $15. Amazing how expensive others try to charge for a piece of metal.
B00FZORU86|5|Fast shipment. As described. Thank you!
B00K30NBOY|4|very sturdy product. it lifts my 2015 victory cross country no problems well built and quick delivery I recommend this
B000GU5IH4|2|(Writing this under my wife's account)<br />This is a good cover if your bike is only parked in full shade and you just want protection from the occasional very light rain or some road dust. Other than that, look elsewhere. Mine faded fast then started disintegrating in less than a year and I live in the beautifully temperate climate of Long Beach, CA, where the bike is only in direct sun for a few hours on the weekend, then shaded by my house the rest of the time (I never take my cover with me to work). I've duct-taped it together multiple times, but it's finally time to just throw it out. I haven't found a replacement cover yet, but there's got to be something out there that can withstand a little sunshine and keep your bike dry in the off chance that the southern California sky decides to cry.
B001EOWQRQ|4|Fits well and is exactly as it looks. Wish it had a lip to keep it from sliding into the receiver, but I knew it didn't have one when I bought it. This is a good back-up for the one that came with my 2014 Dodge RAM 2500 should I accidentally leave it on the truck after towing my camp trailer and then lose it on the road somewhere. At least this will get me home.
B00OX1WIT8|5|This helps keep your back area organized when you are trying to maintain some order in your car.  Everyone stores stuff in the car, we just need a little organization for that needed stuff back there.. This makes that look good and the space more functional and organized.  If you don't have one, you need one.  This one is big enough to fit it all.
B0089GBA5G|4|Fits well and does the job
B00EN9DOP2|1|Leaked. Float needle was obviously set too high from the manufacture.
B00NLP70N6|3|they would be better if it came with a lock washer that kept it in place. the mirror tends to fold in on the hinge at speeds over 50mph. so pretty ineffective for highway driving.
B00H36XX6C|4|I didn't expect much out of this, just a battery pack pretending to be a flashlight, or a flashlight pretending to be a battery pack. I was wrong on both counts. It really does a great job as both a battery back and flashlight. The light is extremely bright, and almost Surefire light quality in the clean, clear light it produces. The battery/charger is also great. It takes a charge fast and then transfers it just as quickly, running 2.1 in and out. It is very low profile, about the size you'd expect from an actual 250 lumen flashlight. The square shape might have been to make it look cool, but it does help to keep the light in place when you set it down. The rubber over gives good grip, and potentially decent protection (I've not tested that yet). My only issue is that the cover for the charging port on mine will not stay closed at all.
B001V8RYTA|4|work well...
B003LSJJJ6|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B00A2AQRM8|5|This item has provided the best protection for my leather seats. It not greasy.
B00LFQAVBG|1|Toyota paseo is 4 lug ! Wth?
B0073I3ON2|5|These are great replacement headlights , gives a fresh look to your Jetta. Highly recommend these, they were also very easy to install.
B00DVLKO6U|5|Spent a good deal of time researching for great airflow and protection at the right price. This is it!!<br /><br />Fits well. Flows a great deal of air during my inner-city daily commute. I feel pretty safe in this because of the leather enhancements at the common impact points (Shoulder, Elbow).  Would recommend and would purchase again.
B00FJXKE5E|5|I don't write reviews often but I must say initially, this device was a little wacky (July reviews seem to sum it up) but I bought a second one for my other car and after updating the firmware on both devices, they track all of my trips. I use it primarily to track my miles but it's cool to see how many miles you have left until empty. Haven't used the check engine light yet but also a neat feature which will pay for itself in the long run. Also nice to have the emergency alert feature. I have a luxury car and when I got into an accident, it automatically called my emergency contacts. I since cancelled that service and it's nice to know this product can do it - haven't tried that feature yet. But for $99 seems like this will pay for itself. I used to pay $5 a month for an app to track all my driving for business expenses. Customer support is also very good! Quick response and helpful. Have recommended this product to several friends already. Too bad there's no referral program. Ie discount for next new version or model.
B00VVWIIS2|5|Good sticker. I would buy again for a new car. The only problem is that most letters would stick to the base paper and not to the clear paper over it to put on the car. Its hard to explain I hope you got it.
B0068FZ538|5|Used it in my motorcycle because this stuff is way cheaper than the one marketed for motorcycles. No issues, works great, love the product!
B00KOI0E8Q|2|Looks cool but that's about all does not fit well at all slides down on your face wile riding wouldn't recommend for riding but great at parties.
B005CLPSAO|2|Installed on god daughter's vehicle.  It did not fix the problem but it was a nicer looking handle.
B009EAARDC|5|Fits great. Arrived sooner than expected.
B005QW9EOA|5|Fit like advertised and arrived undamaged
B007Y34V3S|5|two white fenders with rope just like it says.
B00CLSBW1U|5|Awesome!
B00VL9IT7U|4|I love this for small items that I don't want rolling around or for a bag with a carton of eggs.  Only buy one!  I was expecting the trunk cutouts to be on both sides so I ordered 2 but it is only on one side.  It is VERY easy to install, you only need a Phillips head screwdriver.
B00TPQMS3C|5|Nice!
B00JORJXRQ|2|Piece of plastic that if I had the time I would have made myself. I knocked the one off the boat trailer and just wanted it replaced quick. Not worth the money, but if you want it replaced without thinking about it, it is OK.
B00GNU2IQ0|5|Very fast shipping. Packed very well also. Good solid glass lenses. They look great on my 91 Camaro. The light output is better than the sealed beams. I did have to use a couple of relays to make them work like factory though. I wanted these glass globes because they look better than the all multi LED globes and I am planning to replace the H-4 bulbs with hi power LED single bulbs to get even better light output. The fit is perfect as is my satisfaction.
B006Z907TY|5|This is a life saver. One of the best purchases I have ever made. I have never had a problem with being told I couldn't use it and I am able to put it on and take it off very discreetly.
B000C2AOOI|5|very good
B00CNEQYF6|5|Very pleased and easy to install on Ram 3500
B000UKDAMU|5|Great
B000EQE3TY|4|Looks and works great.
B00H5F2DJY|1|Not even close to red. Kinda a purple/pick color. They arrived scratched with color chipping off. Very disappointed. Usually have no issues when ordering stuff on Amazon.
B00NI0S36M|5|Fit perfectly on my 2015 Polaris RZR900 Trail!
B00Q3NCUL0|4|The product is great! The only thing that is awful is the controls, it would've been better if it had a shortcut at least for the main colors... Going through all the colors and modes to find your color is not cool.
B003Z5D824|1|Terrible quality. All torn up after just a few uses. Just disintegrating right in front of our eyes. Don't buy!
B0002KRC5O|5|Well made!
B001AJMOLS|5|Fits great.  A little vibration but worth being able to see around what we are hauling.
B000HBM6RW|5|Awesome for mechanics.
B009NGJ97W|5|Very sturdy and plenty of storage.
B00TYZKVU6|5|Fits great!  Fast delivery!! Better than I thought it would be!!
B000PMJBRG|5|worked great. Back on the water again
B008G328IU|5|Exactly what I expected no comments see the ratings numbers Don't lie
B00QSPU0NS|5|Excellent quality tool use it more often than expected to remove or transfer fuel.
B000P6WMO6|4|Bought this for my dad (who has expensive taste). He uses it for detailing his cars. Installation was so easy that you don't even need directions. It pretty much comes put together.
B00ISR9H9W|5|Perfect fit on a 2014 Chevy 1500 Silverado.
B00MLO3S52|5|I purchased this for two reasons.  My husband works in a warehouse that has to keep the door open during the winter to air out the smoke and smell of oils.  Having said that it gets extremely cold during the winters.  My husband loves this and says it is very very warm and keeps his body heat in.  He has also used it when riding his motorcycle to avoid windburn as well.  It is adjustable to your face and fits snug.  It has air holes so that you don't feel like you are suffocating or get an anxious feeling.  I was very tempted to keep this for myself but know he needs it a million times more than i do.  It is made of a nice soft material that will not scratch or irritate your face.  It is also washable as long as you air dry it.  This is perfect if you live in states that deal with extreme cold conditions during the winter.  It is worth every penny spent on it.  It is one of the best investments i have made for sure.  I purchased this item at a discount for my honest unbiased review.
B007KPTVDA|5|This item was shipped quickly and works great
B00EPDL5XE|5|great item....looks and feels great on steering wheel.
B00B3W5H5M|5|thats bs about have to order different one for each side is crazy.  these work either side.
B00GURJZZI|5|GREAT PRICE AAA+++++ SCOOTER WORKING LIKE NEW. I DO RECOMEND THESE SEALER, FAST SHIPPING. WILL DO BUSINESS AGAIN. THANK YOU
B004GOENAE|1|No it did not it was to small
B0015353XU|5|works good thanks
B00WW87XU8|5|The shipment arrived in excellent condition thank you
B0002MAJB6|4|This is a good little add on for when you are not using a hitch. Also ads a break light. It could be constructed from metal but it dose what I expected. It also came with a rubber shim to protect it from being loose and rubbing when going over bumpy travel.
B00CBZAAKC|4|Fits well on my new 2015 4Runner and way better than the one that come with the car.
B000YQ9NZI|3|It worked well for 1.5 years.  I'm in Arizona and park the jeep outside during the summer (105 - 115).  The first summer this worked perfectly, we're in the second summer now and it has fallen apart (it is literally crumbling and has holes).  If you're not in an area as hot as Arizona it will probably work well for you.
B008UYZFSK|5|Love it!
B001HX9WVM|5|The good stuff here. Yiu will need this on bellows install. Hard to clean up but you don't want a leak.
B00F8RS4B2|5|Got this for my brothers birthday. He freaking loves it.
B003QVJ79K|1|Like a lot of people here I had the antifreeze leak with the OEM manifold on a 2000 F-150 5.4L.  I ordered this and installed it several times with constant vacuum leak symptoms.  My mating surfaces were super clean, flat, and dry.  The torquing was 100% correct each time.  I verified that the PCV fitting in the rear had the required O-ring and I even applied some RTV to make sure it wasn't leaking there.  Still the engine was missing.  Spraying on the seals at the heads, throttle body, and pcv showed no signs of leakage so I concluded there must be a leak in the manifold itself.<br /><br />I contacted Dorman with this information and they were not very helpful.  They said they'd ship me a replacement after I mailed them the current one which I reluctantly agreed to since I had installed it either 3 or 4 times with the same results.  During the 2 week wait I repaired my OEM manifold with JB Weld and installed it with a nice pair of crush gaskets.  Fired up smooth the first time!  When I finally received the replacement Dorman I sold it on Ebay for about $50.  I've been running about 14,000 miles since then with no problems.<br /><br />If I ever had to deal with this issue again I'd pull a manifold from a junk yard engine, I thing they fixed the issue in the 2002 or 2003, and forget about the Dorman.  Also, if you hold the OEM manifold in one hand and the Dorman in the other you can tell the OEM is much more robust.<br /><br />Hopefully my experience isn't the norm for this manifold and I've had a lot of success with other Dorman products.  Had the customer service been up to snuff I'd probably have never tried to repair my OEM and the replacement may have worked fine.
B004YR49R0|5|worked well as advertised
B0000AZ75Z|5|Best deodorizer on the market.
B0049UM8N4|5|Works just as it should
B00FDQPCR2|1|Doesnt always turn on.  Maybe something wrong with the one i got.  80% of thr time it works
B00BEDC1MM|2|Flip down sun shield would NOT filp down. Returned and bought the much cheaper model with no sun shield.
B00JRE38EA|5|Great LEDs. Used them in my jeep, work perfectly. Could use a bit more light but considering they are 5smd. Not bad, about the same area coverage as the original tube lights just bright white versus yellow light.
B00MXFI5E8|1|Wrong ones.
B00EDFM6R8|4|Bright and have lasted longer than previous bulbs.
B00ISAA6KS|5|Amazing guards, fit my 2015 wrangler perfect and look better than other guards. These are beefy looking and well built.
B000JGEKLK|5|Great product but did not match my antenna, can say it looks great on my neighbors motorcycle though, will recommend to friends and will purchase from seller again
B00021XQLC|5|grate tow truck strap
B00H36XX6C|5|This is a very interesting charge pack as it is splash resistant, but also includes a LED flashlight. I wouldn't say it is a tactical light, but more of a stronger pocket flashlight with a built-in battery pack to charge smartphones and tablets. It will fit into large cargo pockets, so I can use it to charge a phone while secured in my pocket or in the center console of a car. I wouldn't submerge it though, as it is only IP65 water resistant.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars
B007BKPVDI|4|My only complaint is that the o-rings will occasionally pop out of their seats. Since they are just standard black o-rings, I anticipate a need to replace them at some point after weather and sun have taken their toll on them.
B0026M5ROE|5|Just what I wanted. Arrived on time.
B0038B9CMK|5|Lights are awesome. Fit is perfect Installation went just as it shows in video  Lights work awesome and look even better
B001KNYOPI|5|Vary well made repair kit and fits nice in under the seat
B00CPKV8JU|5|OMG!!! what a difference... my husband and I went in our bike from NYC to Boston, New Hampshire, Main to the border with Canada and this little friend made my ride pain and complaint free. My husband got surprised cause he did not heard any complaints about numbness of pain in my butt.<br />Before Butty Buddy I got a gel seat but it did not work for me.<br />I Love Butty Buddy, please believe me... it works!!
B00L4TF32G|5|great
B00BYH6C1E|4|Best French Fry catcher ever!
B0009YDQEE|3|Nothing wrong with the product, the color just didn't match up like I would have liked. A lot darker than I thought...
B005SMUOR4|5|This is a very handy tool. Just right for the job.
B00GHSIG00|1|After entering my vehicle make and model the message appears that says the needles are included. BE AWARE NOT NEEDLES ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS ITEM.  You only get the instrument panel. Despite the fact that a message says needles are include NONE are included.  I returned this item to only get a 20% refund that didn't even cover the amount I had to pay to get needles with an instrument panel for my suburban.
B00804F080|5|Perfect fit.  Excellent quality.  Performance improvement immediate.
B001GRSDJQ|4|It was slightly deformed from being rolled up in its shipping box. It took a few days but straightened out. It is very high quality. I was initially concerned because the lip was flattened down in one area from being rolled up. I have Weathertech in my Silverado and this Captiva(Vue).  I went with Husky liners for another car we own. They work too, but WeatherTech seems to wear better and looks better over the couple years that I have owned both.
B00ENKG5HK|4|Fits 99 Subaru Forester S. Very sturdy plug.
B00605DUI8|5|Great muffler for 2005 Jeep liberty!
B0009V1WS4|5|lock as described shipping time was good.
B009OEKUR6|5|I love it! It's a beautiful keychain. Love the Heart! Very proud mom! Thanks.
B0050DCB90|5|OK ITEM
B00IGJKFXE|5|great
B002W8IICA|5|The Rampage Boot gives the jeep a exquisite look. Very appealing & a lot more heads turn mow when I wrangle through the streets.
B0041G1C0Q|5|Easy install. Great product.
B000C17G4U|5|went together without a problem and solve all.. Nice unit and Amazon was great..
B00LM56CIQ|5|Great, long lasting scent.
B00EZ9Y33W|5|Best wiring harness for LED light bar I've ever used. Just plug and play done.
B00HFX38U4|5|Perfect for checking the pressures on a motorbike - the head fits in nicely between big front discs on a hard to reach valve, without scratching paint on wheels. Has a nice little pressure release valve too but remember to use that to vent the gauge between tyres, resetting it to zero. Otherwise it stays at the higher pressure and you won't get an accurate reading. Dispatched in a timely manner, appropriately packaged (enough, not packing overkill). Used it a few times. So far, so good, and has underlined just how wildly off gas station air gauge readings can be.
B00029WYEY|5|IT WAS AWESOME !!!!!!
B00OWS4J6M|5|This top is awesome! I went from a hardtop to this and I wont look back. The install is a bit of a hassle. It took my about 2.5 hours to do it alone. Could probably be done in 1.5 if someone was there to help you line everything up. It's as quiet as my hard top was. I would def. recommend this to any jeep owners looking to replace their factory hard top.
B0006MQIY4|2|Very small package.  nice to have in one set though.
B009YZKCH8|3|cover well, but had to spray it many more times
B009FZYZEI|5|It was the perfect part for my Toyota Corolla airconditioner idle up , I just made a little change to the electrical connector to make it fit and it's been working since then.<br />Amazon was the only place where I found it I tried so many  auto parts but no luck.<br />THANK YOU
B004I0E9YG|5|One should always be concerned after reading others' reviews as was I.  The price is almost too good to be true and expected delivery date was worrisome as I would have to drive around with a taillight out.  Well, I rec'd it today way ahead of schedule and am more than delighted with every aspect of this order.  It fit perfectly and took mere minutes to install it.  OH, and I personally think this design is better than the OEM assembly.  There is no circuity to short out which means never replacing the lens again, simply the bubls.
B00OUJ5HPA|3|Nice mirror, just wrong one. This was returned.
B00DCO2ZYU|5|Used these axles to replace both front CV axles in my 2005 Toyota Tundra. They were a direct replacement. The axles come with a lifetime warranty, however there is a statement in the warranty that says torn boots are not accepted. And from my experience with Tundra inner CV axles on a lifted application, torn boots are the prime source of failure. Oh well.  There is a good feature on these axles that is not on the OEM axles though, which I think will make them easier to rebuild for boot replacement in the future: the inner boot race is a solid piece of steel, there is no multi-lipped channel to grab onto. Makes it easier to measure a replacement boot size. It also makes these axles appear to be very robust.  The axle chamfers were acceptable. I prefer a smoother transition into the gearbox, so I ran the edges over a deburring wheel. Also the inner axle retaining ring was square edged, not round edged like the OEM axle retainer. That made the insertion a little more difficult, but still doable.  The inner axle did not come with a seal, so you have reuse the OEM metal seal. Careful not to bend/break the OEM seal when removing the old axle.  Overall a solid part here that I recommend. And super inexpensive!
B004SRA8GW|5|Fixed my driver side door with about an hour of work, glad i did, the old regulator was bent way out of shape
B00V30J86I|1|It is very small. A normal size purse doesn't fit and attaching the bottom in my car is impossible. I put it over the back seat to hold small items, but so far haven't used it at all.
B00KSUA6HY|1|Update: After half a year, two lights have already died. I take them off and replaced with regular bulbs. I have lost confidence on these led lights.<br /><br />I am OK with this product:<br />Pros:<br /> * They are bright<br /> * Cheap<br />Cons:<br /> * Directional light<br /> * Hard to install because they are polarized, you need to use trial-and-error to install them by switching them 180 degrees.<br /> * No user manual
B000BZIFV0|4|It fits the 2006 Acura TL.
B00H1I4XBQ|5|I like these lug nuts a lot. they match my hostile wheels perfectly.
B001C5MEZ6|3|I like my leather one better.
B00BITIOJ6|3|This is not the same as the original part. It works, but just doesn't feel right.
B00B0C18B2|5|bake kit worked well
B002IVCSIG|5|Just right for the application which was for an RV and not a boat.  I had wasps wanting to nest in my wet bay so I used the ring to reduce the  opening of the access hole for the fresh water hose.  The ring fit tightly around the hose and coax so no more annoying wasps in the wet bay.
B00ST0XBX6|4|This item, while cheap, is perfect for the application.  Put it right on the 50CC Redcat my son has and fired right up.  With minimal tuning the carb is performing perfectly.
B00FALW192|1|Only received one of the four compounds , the one with the purple label, highly disappointed. Would like my money back
B00IUV7PFO|4|Battery came fully charged.  The size was actually smaller than expected, however it cranks the ATVs starter just fine.
B0006SU3QW|5|Great product!
B000XQ9MGE|5|This product is amazing!  I have needed it multiple times and it works perefectly, easy to use and is a real comfort to have in vehicle when needed rather than needing to ask a stranger or waiting for someone to come to jump car. Would definitely buy again.
B00KADI3H4|1|needs to be recalled will not charge returned the first one now the second one will not charge DO NOT BUY
B000BVRZ74|5|Worth the buy!
B00CQCKIWU|4|Item seems well built!  No instructions included, and conflicting information on Internet.  Installed using common sense & it fits well and looks great!  Would buy from this vendor again.
B00LAIYOX0|5|Very easy to install.
B00GVTHB7Y|5|wonderful product
B00HUVNHX4|5|Was able to wait out the wait to be delivered - 1 week. Was easily installed by my mechanic and after 2 weeks, still starts right up. Saved me 75% of what an auto parts store would have charged. Very satisfied.
B001B7C1AI|5|Perfect fit. Comes with orings. Easy to install.
B000GU3KHE|5|This is my second purchase of this product. It is the best cover I have ever used.
B00LUS7RKW|5|fix perfect
B005GL8YEW|5|Delivered as described.
B00TQZN5PW|1|Didn't come with anything. No washers, no bolts, no screws, no clasps, no instructions. I could have done it buying the small parts but every other kit has included these things.
B00NLRBA7Q|3|As described.
B00ARB4T7W|5|Great thread very very strong. I bought five other brands and this is the best strongest top notch thread. if this thread doesn't do it for you then maybe it is because you don't know how to sew; give up sewing, and probably nothing else in life pleases you either, get the picture. Buy this buy the best..
B00D9C2CDO|5|Drove with it for four hours to go camping. Attached securely and everything stayed dry. Good buy.
B00KMUMJZ2|5|Great for getting at those hard to reach filters!
B00JH1HJXE|1|I give zero stars!!!it says one but thats a lie!not for the product but the customer service.ordered these and turned out to be the wrong ones.got ahold of them and told them the issue and see if they would exchange for the ones I need.pretty much told me I'm S.O.L. But were nice enough to tell me which ones I need.gee...thanks!
B00NLME87U|2|This doesn't fit the FR-S at all. It can be stretched to fit but one side will be more covered than the next. Also, the side mirror covers doesn't measure up with the mirrors properly. However, the cover is surprisingly good for wet and cold/snowy weather conditions.
B004RNR9QY|5|Great price, just what I needed.
B00O6QK7N4|4|6374 brake kit, 2014 XLT - good stopping power, looks great, quick delivery from Speedy Brake Kits
B0066RI08U|5|Good product
B000E7YP82|5|Used this produce on a road trip several weeks ago it performed well in the extreme heat we had. Easy to access the contents, but stays put on the roof rails.
B000RW1XCK|5|5 stars, primerless one step urethane. This is the only urethane I use in my shop, and it's priced rite aswell.
B00JCZ1O40|5|Great sticker
B00D8Y71ZM|5|Great, thanks A+
B002P2RE9G|5|I don't understand why they have these listed with Kawasaki in the header. If they would change that they would probably get more sales. I purchased these for my Suzuki GSX R600 and am so glad I did. Debated for a couple of months on which ones to buy starting out influenced to purchase the outrageously priced Pit Bull stands which cost $150 per stand. I just didn't want to spend that kind of money. After a lot of looking I came across these and couldn't see why they wouldn't work with my bike. Was a little worried they would be crap at that price but that is so not the case. They could sell these for more money. They are very well built and look nice not cheaply made at all. You won't be disappointed in these they are worth every penny.
B00ATGGT7S|4|good quality
B000CKGAV6|1|I bought the pair to replace both headlights even though only one headlight was out.  My one good headlight was brighter than these two combined.  These headlights are very dim.
B006FOEDO4|5|2012 ram 2500 perfect fit holds 1 gallon more oil, diff runs MUCH cooler now. Well worth the money.
B00E9HWRK6|3|it fits my 2014 toyota sienna le ok
B00TAVUOTW|5|Awesome! Looks great on the car!
B0089LSQHG|5|Exactly as listed. Perfect fit. Easy to install.
B00Y3GZHAU|5|I liked the first one so much I bought a second one to fix the other side latch.
B00HWIZO6I|5|As advertised.  I initially bought this for a delicate leather jacket that was still fairly new but wanted to protect.  I put 3 coats on the jacket, and it looks better than it did brand new.  Then I used it on a leather fedora, and 2 pairs of boots and dress shoes.  Everything looks fantastic, and I'm not even halfway through the bottle yet, so a little bit does go a long way.<br />In addition to it being a good product, I found the customer service to be wonderful.  I received several emails from the time I ordered until a couple of weeks after its arrival to make sure I was satisfied with the product.<br />I will definitely purchase this product again when my current supply runs out and have already recommended it to a few friends.
B001TJXWH4|4|Great product did a good job of maintaining towels softness and cleanliness.
B007UTPUDQ|4|Should have brought the 6&#34;. The bottom of the hitch interferes with the park assistance of my truck. The pin was too short for the receiver and the locks were not keyed alike. Overall it is a great hitch.
B004MSJ7C8|5|Works great. I used to balance my Triumph Bonneville. Was an simple 5 minute job with this unit.
B004I9HVJ2|4|Good looking mirror.  Great field of view. The spot mirror not so much. I'm not sure what is off about it but it almost seems like it's coated and not cover glass. Blinkers are highly visible through the glass. 4 out of 5 for me.
B004RTKXYS|5|Good as new, they fit perfectly
B000C6ZWMS|5|as described.
B0085KGOIE|5|Love it! It's the perfect size to hold a lot of gray water from our tent-trailer without being too horribly heavy to move. And, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the metal piece that you can use to hitch it to your car for easy transport was included with this model.
B0089DZZ2I|3|Did not fit my Baha 200. I did not take mine apart and measure them before ordering. My mistake. So please measure yours. The brakes are the size indicated in the picture, THEY ARE NOT, The size in the written description. However, if your brakes are the size indicated in the picture, what I received is a quality japan major manufacturer part and you will most likely be happy with them.....MEASURE FIRST !!!
B0000AZ5PM|5|As a 1st timer using 2 part glazing this material is easy to work with, sands good and provides very smooth finish. However, you only need to use about a Tsp full or it will harden. Also buy an extra tube of the hardner.
B00T36Q5L0|5|Perfect fit just like the original  factory exhaust.  Recommended.
B007JG1W1E|4|works great when I remeber to use it
B00YBQYXZW|5|Could not ask for a better light bar and the installation is insanely easy!
B00DQ9T7XI|5|what a buy! sounds great and with the just about the right back up pressure.
B00S2IBEHU|5|Easily Installed, Worked Perfectly!!
B003RF8VEC|5|my wife loves it no need to say any more
B00OGPSD4K|5|Great product plug and play easy install
B00NF1R6US|4|I bought this as a replacement for my factory one. Unfortunately for anybody that works on these vehicles (Mine is a 2011 Chrylser 200, likely Dodge avenger models of the same era and maybe even sebrings) knows getting the air filter out is the easy part, but getting it back in is tough. I had done it myself a couple of times, but thought it must just be me. Unfortunately, it seemingly happens to the people that change my oil as well. I have had them chage the filter a few times now, and unfortunately i am not sure which garage broke the front clasp, and of course they both deny it. Thus, I heard this buzzing noise as i am going down the interstate in my 4 year old car, and it sounds like a music instriment reed vibrating from someone poorly playing. It was as I accelerated. I thought it might be something caught in the intake, so I looked, and the clasp was broke allowing just enough air to suck in by the gasket as the car needed the air for the power. I ordered this noting it was a great price, and I again adventured under the hood to fix it.  It is the same design as the factory one, so it fits tight as well. But, it was a great price compared to getting a factory one, durable and maybe a bit more flex than the factory one, making it a bit more easy to put on. Either way, fit in like factory without issue.
B003VLBPJA|3|did not seem new
B006K8V3NE|5|This is the coolest battery mount I've used and I've used some! Though I used it on my John Deere b/c I wanted a real battery for the yard tractor. U know ~ one that would start it dependably and operate the switch for the PTO which in this case is the cutting deck. Solid! ~;0)
B002XM5G70|5|This pump replaced the old pump and does a outstanding job.  I have a pop up tent trailer and it fit perfect. took a matter of 5 minuts to install

B0009IBJE4|4|Product performed as advertised.
B00EECM5FI|5|I purchased the set for my 2001 BMW 325i.  The installation took roughly 30 mins to an hour.  You can take the headlights out if you choose, but you can also change out the lights without taking them out.  I recommend taking them out.  I used a 1/4&#34; Drive Round Head Quick-Release Ratchet, an extension, and a #8 5/16 socket to loosen the bolts.  Don't proceed in taking the light out immediately, for you could perhaps tear the molding under the headlight.  The molding has a few snaps you'll need to push.  If you're going to keep the wiring hooked up to the light, disconnect the battery.  You're not installing halogen, but HID lights - which require a lot more volts.  The lights are super bright and white.  There is a slight blueish tint, but hardly noticeable.  I took the vehicle out for a spin and could easily notice the stretch of light hitting the trees on both shoulder of the road.  I'm satisfied with the look and how bright the lights are.  I've had them in for a week now and still no issues.  I received the package within two days also, so that's a bonus.  I'd recommend and probably buy again.
B0040E1HJA|5|I had another similar type of mirror. This mirror gives me a larger rear field of view without cover too much more of the front window. This mirror is AWSOME, I will be getting more for my family to help with watching out for car blind spots.
B002OUZK0Y|5|working great
B00BD5GU82|3|The background color is more orange than beige. For the price, they're the quality I expected.
B00HZBA87M|3|Not what I expected but it served it's purpose.
B008E10Y7G|5|Exactly as advertised. Paint matches perfectly and piece looks fantastic. Highly recommended.
B009GX924M|3|Glad I read previous reviews as they said to go a size larger than your normal size I've been using this helmet on a daily basis for almost a month now the CONS are the padding won't stay buttoned in when putting it on and taking it off it was dropped as it rolled off the floorboard in my truck as I opened the door so maybe 3-4' drop the finish is coming off on the back by the light where it had landed n the slide for the sunvisor got caught by the wind n come off n the vents randomly open n close while riding PROS helmet is lightweight n good viewing range n the light on the back is really nice for visibility n gets lots of compliments n it's a comfortable helmet overall not too bad for the money but this helmet just became my passenger helmet though
B00AWHM6FI|5|Great tag!
B000AM8BLI|5|great product great price
B0015YC0PI|4|Exactly as advertised.
B00CJGGD7C|5|Perfect fit and ez to mount.
B00ONDM07G|5|Well designed and manufactured. Great fit. It is easy to assemble, install and adjust. Love the fact that I was able to mount my GoPro in front by screwing one of my tripod mounts to it, the cellphone adapter behind it and can switch to the GPS on the fly by simply removing the cellphone holder  and using the ball mount to attach the GPS. The tray is pretty much open and left for my other stuff. The Jeep's cockpit is pretty tight. Space and visibility come at a premium so this add-on helps organize my electronics in a non-intrusive/obstructive way.
B00AV9EBIM|5|Love it fast shipping
B00JRCA8X6|5|Great product at an affordable price. I love theses brushes. I have used them several times and the keep producing outstanding results. I recommend this kit.
B00P1TDM28|4|Really helps take the pressure off my lower back, this has been extremely helpful in reducing pain from sitting at the computer for long periods of time working.
B00XVZYTLM|5|The work well in RV, Brighter and cooler than incandescent bulbs.
B00493U6H6|5|Great
B00BD2TVKO|5|received fast, good condition...have to flip it over every so often-but that's sitting at computer on it for few hours straight. My rear end is enjoying sitting on it.
B000WOZSGK|5|Ordered it, and got it the next day, I was totally surprised.
B0006SH4GE|5|Great product...
B000NU1IQ2|5|Good stuff...!
B003D7YRYW|5|good quality stickies well awesome quote.
B0027SIJX8|5|Fit perfect under the seat of my 2010 F150 Platinum with Sub-Woofer. If you don't have the Sub-Woofer you need the longer one. I'm pretty amazed at how much stuff I got in there.
B0080XLJA4|4|This product serves its purpose but the sealant around the eyes is already coming loose
B0026A5AIE|5|Very bright, easy to install, moves traffic. Same light output as the whelen avenger but for a lot less money. It does the job and does it well.
B00BVV5XWM|5|Serves its purpose well.
B00DP6SC9C|5|Working well
B00D8DR0AO|5|I have tried various different car wash soaps, and I decided to give this a try given the luck I have had with Optimum's tire gel.  It takes a lot of detergent to wash the car but the amount of dirt it cleans off the car and how quickly it dries has been great!!<br /><br />Also, I have been impressed with how effective it is in cleaning the brake exhaust from the tire rims.
B003HC5PVC|4|Not bad.  The plastic was a little rough in some areas, and the white &#34;AVS&#34; logo is a pain to remove.
B00LIC63UU|5|Really cool! Saves so much time of checking tires, especially the spare under my RV. Be careful as the antenna is a bit fragile. Very pleased.
B000EZICII|5|This and awesome product I use on all my cars
B008G2B2H4|5|Looks and works great...easy to install
B007V2CPWG|4|Great fit on my 2007 Silverado.  Folds up easy and looks great when in the window.
B000VL3RGM|5|Nice metal frame. I bought one from a different supplier which was plastic. Once a Marine, ALWAYS A MARINE!!! OORAH!
B002NEWWPM|5|A lot beefier than factory -- and greaseable, too!
B00A82A4N8|5|Received battery in five days. Works like it should.
B0012ETPUE|4|Not an actual review of the bulb, but I bought these for my Kawasaki KLR 650 and they did not fit. Beware if you are buying these as replacement bulbs for your motorcycle. Amazon also said this was a fit for my bike.  *Edit: Needed to plug it into a socket, after they fit fine. Still need to use them to see how good they are.
B00ASB0DKS|4|Perfect for helmets, super fast ship, Thanks!
B00CKZLYVM|1|This product was photoshopped to appear the size of an area rug when in fact is more like the size of a welce may. Not worth the price. Product was not delivered with in 2 days with prime membership.
B00H1IBKIK|5|fit and look great
B000F09CEA|5|It Works.
B0055AZ3QG|5|Very high-quality. At the right price
B000AMBOI0|5|Great tool to have around. I use it all the time.
B00UN2248Q|3|Good quality but doesnt completly stay on the tank the top wont stay stuck to the tank
B00318NROY|5|Perfect for my needs.  I have a 6 volt system on an old motor scooter and, not being able to find 6 volt bulbs, found that these actually work and seem to last as tail lights / brake lights.
B00ZSNUBDK|1|Very thin, very big and does nothing, I bought shades from 0.99¢ stores and are keeping the car cooler then that shades sorry
B00DD0ZPP4|3|It will not fit on a '12 Nissan Murano....gave it to a friend. It sure was pretty
B00IFFW2S0|5|Without instructions, its difficult to figure how to get it installed. It does require the removal of both front engine mount brackets. It fits very snug to the frame and exhaust. Assembly is like a jigsaw puzzle, but once the order of how things go into place, it becomes easy.
B00P8AJX9G|1|I bought the 8in antenna and been having bad reception with it.
B00ASB2536|4|Good product but not as bright as I hope.
B00D3O5LUO|5|Seems like a good replacement for the original battery in my Generac generator at a good price.
B0050Z9TAW|5|I bought this product for me 07 vw rabbit and they're absolutely amazing! But one thing I do see everyone asking is there anything else you need for these lights, everyone says no but the answer is yes for ANYONE looking to buy any type of HID kit. You need to buy projector headlights otherwise you'll blind everyone with the light scatter in the reflective housings. Don't be a jerk, do it right and get the projector housings, they cost a little bit of money but that's what you get when you want to start modifying your car/truck. Do it right and don't be a jerk. Good day all!
B00HLYJBWG|4|I really like it! Its a cool piece to pull out and show your friends, with the nifty transformation and all. Bullet to pipe in seconds.  Con: Would be better if it was made out of a stronger metal, making it heavier. Also, it would be cooler if the tip, the &#34;Bullet&#34;, were a darker more brass-like color, to be more realistic.
B00VYDLCTU|5|thanks love it
B00MXVYNTS|4|Works and looks great.  If it had come with wiring instructions, I would rate it five stars.
B003UM7B98|5|Very sleek design and very sturdy will fit under most cars well, holds a car up great!
B003SWNVI0|3|This thing fit WAY more than we expected it to fit and perhaps because we overstuffed it making the zippers exposed, it allowed rainwater to seep into it and soak our stuff.  Luckily, it only had inflatable kayaks (5 of them) and our kayaking gear.  If you know the size of a US Navy Sailor's seabag, think 5 of those... that's what we had stuffed into it.  I guess if you want it to be rainproof, you have to make sure that the zippers are fully concealed under the flap.
B00N1E6QK0|5|These fit my car perfectly, and I'm still amazed at the price I got them for.
B008NZGI4Q|5|An exact fit.
B00LM55LDI|5|Great Product!  Fast shipping!  Thanks!
B006B2A3AS|5|no problem-thank you!
B00PYQC75G|5|I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order! The material is very nice and soft and true to the color in the picture! Doesn't get overly hot in our Arizona sun! Very happy with the quality and the price was outstanding! I would highly recommend!
B000E65PIC|5|Installed easy and didn't leak!!<br />Arrived quickly
B00CFH9L88|5|Good product and quick delivery. No worries about losing a key because there is no key! Works great on my AR-15 & Glock 19.
B000G7AJTO|5|Recieved the next day after ordering...very pleased
B000C122V2|5|Fits my car just fine, I have no complaints. We found out we had a short in the wiring somewhere. So, it is going to be a whole before we can use this product. Bummer!!! You do get exactly what you pay for though. So thanks for that!
B007Y869JC|5|working great
B000IYQCN2|5|it has been the car for a good while now, and I have had no problems from it. Thank You.
B00I1FTXI6|5|Looks great on the vehicle, very nice touch
B00WB8F072|1|The unit works well but it arrived without a power cord.
B0066CP786|2|very loud
B009408LLC|5|Great addition to the back seat!
B007SCNSKW|5|Love the floor mats. Perfect fit
B00TA3PGYI|2|Cracked after 2 weeks
B000C7S422|5|The Has tank fit as advertised it is very well built instead of having plastic baffles inside the tank this one has metal I was very impressed with the construction of the tank. I would definitely buy this brand again. You will need to reuse your straps and the small strips of rubber on top of your old tank but it is no problem to remove and install on new tank.
B005JZSP08|5|With the child seat in the rear middle seat of my car, the rear rest of the rear passengers can't buckle up with the child seat being so big. With this extender, it solves the problem.
B000HT8I9O|2|Good for bigger screws to big for motorcycle stator couldn't use it for my job.
B00IDZUEZU|5|The lights were excatly as they were described. Very well pleased
B00EDWBS48|5|excellent product for price
B0063ZBXZC|4|Does what it's supposed to. Easy install and operation. Sure beats the hand cranker!
B0049MKQD6|4|I like this unit.  I recently rewired my trailer and added this unit at that time.  I have tested it, and it seems to be working fine.<br /><br />I have one problem though.  An amber light is supposed to illuminate when the trailer is plugged into the tow vehicle.  The light indicates that the battery is being charged by the vehicle.  Well, I wired the unit exactly as the instructions specified, but im not getting the Amber light.<br />  However, there is also a button you can press to tell you the charge level of the battery.  I have towed the trailer for about 2 weeks now, and when I push the button, it still says it's fully charged.<br />  So, in not sure if it's charging or not.
B000E67SP0|1|Switch would not work right. When the switch was pluged up it would turn brake lights on all the time. could not ajust so it would work right. I have worked on vehicles all my life.
B003V57NUQ|5|Very well made.
B002692308|5|Fit well
B00DYZ4AW2|2|Looked good at first but dimmer than expected. After six months installed one of the taillights is out. Cheap product with no durability.
B000H8XK5W|5|Great new product that matched the old product. I would highly reco!
B004960XRG|4|Great product went on very easy
B004I0HVO6|5|Worked and fit perfectly
B000CPIJD8|5|excellent product and quality
B00UK5AKEQ|5|Works great in my boat, where it's attached to a switch that controls the inside lighting... plenty of light along just the one side of the boat.
B00H9JRO1S|5|I bought this for my 2015 Jeep Wrangler 4 Door Rubicon.  Overall, installation was easy.  I did not need to remove any bumpers, mufflers, etc as I read in some other reviews.  It is true that space is a little tight (especially when putting on the back washer/nut) but using needle nose pliers I was able to hold and line up the washer and nuts to get them threaded.  Then I was able to tighten down and secure use using a  socket wrench.  The whole process took maybe 25 minutes.  Would recommend!
B0039HD4RM|4|Pretty good quality
B007VR91HS|5|excellent
B0031I2SKS|5|Worked as expected
B0009TUGUG|5|Fits perfect for the older, 2-mile navigation lights.
B0002SA44C|5|would have been fine except grandson wanted full soft top
B00K8E0WAG|5|The best for the best.
B00200C5SI|5|fast shipping good price
B002R0YN8G|1|Shipping time was excellent. However product us not oem quality, it's plastic not composit. Also the mount for bulb connection was improperly sized, thus requiring some reshaping a very fragile peice.
B005EAR3BK|5|Exactly what I was expecting.
B00PA70ILE|5|perfect fit -matched oem exactly!!  PRICE beat all others I am the spouse who had to install all !!! Highly recommend this product!! Will use them again!!!!
B006GFLI0O|5|Evs beanie worKS great on these 90 degree days when I'm riding to work in heavy traffic thanks evs
B005CWU290|5|Love them
B00MXF4N8U|3|does not help
B0011KXXVG|5|The horn installed easily. All parts and wiring fit perfectly. It pays to buy genuine Polaris parts.
B001P2L5RO|4|These worked good on my 2002 F350 Wish there was a third support
B00EDTMCXC|5|Great!!!
B00PGRGSH6|5|Very bright! Didn't fit my 99 accord socket though. So they are just haging in there. Works fine though
B00AHJMXXQ|5|Looks great, no brake noise.  The reason I got these is because my factory rotor and pads were very noisy.  A side benefit is that this rotor is finished with a coating to prevent rust unlike the factory rotors.  Clear look especially since I have an open wheel pattern where you can really see the disk and rotor.
B00IKJDC1W|4|Easy installation
B00FA2AD5U|3|current price @ subaru dealer 5.88$$$$  8/17/15
B004QXRA00|5|Very expensive fluid. A must if you own a BMW.
B00BQ9KF22|2|They look and feel cheap.
B005VKQCKG|5|Worked great. Easy install.
B00B0C1P7O|5|Great kit for a decent price. Got all the sensors and hardware included
B00O06V3QK|5|Plug up the opening when the bicycle rack is removed.
B00HVVVEYM|4|Plenty of space, I have used it once so far. Fits the Pro-Series cargo hitch rack perfectly but the true test will be traveling with it when it rains. I got a cargo net in addition, I like it over the straps.
B00JAD36GI|5|Nice headstall. Strong soft leather once oiled, runs a little big
B003YJK3R4|5|great deal
B00FLQI9QA|5|good
B003CX5VEM|5|Fits snug and appears to keep dust, sun and rain off my car.
B00RKKQWV4|1|Beware, did not fit my 2003 Jeep Liberty.
B00IYGUVYM|1|Didn't fit my car
B004P5G2GM|4|handy little gadget
B00BJAG1O4|4|it's cool
B00UB4PT0Q|5|YAY! The flying time machine!
B00G620ZVU|4|Brighter than I expected.  Housing appears solid and we'll built.  Will pe placing on a pontoon and have not tried them on the lake yet.
B00QEXZVHE|4|They matched nearly perfect with my stock 4300k HID headlights, but were more for looks than function.  I feel that they glared a bit into other driver's eyes as I tended to get flashed every once and a while.  Nice light and color, but it glare's into other driver's eyes based on my picture.  Get these if your headlights are good enough to be used without foglights, because these are more for looks than function and will hardly be noticeable from inside the car when driving.
B00B29SZU0|5|Received these about a month ago. They fit perfect and clean easy. I have purchased husky floor liners before but had amazon points to offset the difference in price so I thought I'd try them and am happy I did!
B001GH5PX8|5|Ok
B00IBM5KPO|5|On time delivery and received what I expected
B0024E6W02|1|Leaks to easy poorly made
B004A30UHG|5|Took about 20 minutes to install. Keeps battery fully charged.
B00CKYKJ6O|5|perfect
B004XONSX0|5|GOOD ITEM PRICED GOOD
B00TUJWGG8|5|I have several VW's and Audi's that monitor all the onboard lights and alert you if one is out. This can be a problem with some LED lights. I can say I have never had a problem related to the JDM ASTAR LED lamps. I have purchased dozens of these bulbs for my cars and will continue to do so. They give a very white, clean, color that is a huge improvement over the &#34;yellow&#34; color from the original OEM bulbs. I am impressed with the range of bulbs available since some auto bulbs can be a little strange.
B009AJMXI4|5|I bought these for my daughters car and they look great.
B000FAPJME|5|Solid pieces of metal here. Was able to secure my tent NO PROBLEM. just need a good hammer and you are set.
B005F9KOY8|5|Great quality and exact fit..!
B000JFJLP6|5|VERY GOOD
B004GDFCKA|5|Great fit easy to install. If you buy this order the door panel clips. You will need them
B001DKT0DO|4|Great! But I expected bigger ones.
B004GCCJQQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2006 chevy trailblazer
B00KJ8L7B4|4|At first when I installed this kit one of the lights didn't work. Once I finally got in connect with them, they replaced the bad ballast that I have gotten. Now everything works. Its been a few days since replaced the ballast and everything seems to be working great
B002PQMLWC|5|Great, thanks A+
B00WABYHP6|1|Recieved wrong color, and Product did not fit application. After going back and forth with t-Rex about the issue Freddy was less then helpful. Tom there tech acknowledged that this isn't the 1st time the product didn't fit the same bike. This has been going on for over a month now and still hasn't been resolved.
B000BUOSGG|5|I purchased this for my RV. One word.....Perfect. It fits in the samller RV sink and takes up little counter space when using.
B00HX8ZNN6|5|Very nice floor mats.
B002GO784Y|5|Perfect fit -east to install.
B00SRFXKV6|5|Excellent quality, fast shipping.<br />Easy to install on my SLK R172. I connected to the daytime running lights, didn't want them on all the time. Work great when you unlock the car at night.<br />Remove the original star by twisting it to the left and pulling<br />Unscrew the 4 screws on your daytime running light (DRL) (Left or Right)<br />Use wire coat hanger to feed the cable supplied from the grill to the DRL<br />Connect +/- to the DRL cables with scotch locks, replace the DRL<br />Wrap the cables in electrical tape.
B005MVB506|4|Pretty quiet.
B004ZC3TFC|1|doesn't work
B0006MTREC|5|works as it should with no problems
B007GR54FQ|5|What a phenomenal product. Bmw leather seats tend to wear on the bolsters when not taken care of. Mine were severely worn, and a good section had the dye missing completely. You would never know it now, we'll  see how it wears...but as of now I couldn't be happier!
B000X9O79I|4|It's a great system very strong, does what it's supposed to do. I would have given it 5 stars however the pre sealed thread compound doesn't do its job. If you do buy this or any other air kit, just buy some teflon tape from the beginning and save yourself the headache of undoing all the connections. I spent an extra hour spraying all the connections undoing them and resealing them.
B00D86O630|5|guuud
B00Y2CJ1S4|5|Great lights bright
B003OXUPOQ|1|Ordered for N14 Cummings engine. Got one for a pick-up.
B00068XCQU|5|I have a classic car I must keep the battery charged in as I don't drive it often. Perfect and easy to use
B003ZJNZB4|5|Provided as posted & on time
B00B2AUJYO|5|As one writer already noted, this is the perfect fix to the 2014 Lance leaking water heater problem. Lance uses plastic check valves on both the inlet and outlet and they WILL crack and leak. This is the perfect replacement part. Easy to install and permanent. When one cracks, the other will be close behind. Replace both at the same time and you'll be fine.
B00M9IAJQQ|5|It was a gift--but I was told it has come in handy. Since the car seat stays in the car now rather than being taken into the house. The idea behind this purchase was to protect my grandson from being hurt by being put into a hot car seat and I was told it had helped.
B004JSBS46|4|first one was a dud the replacement works great in my coat closet
B00STXAXJ8|5|Front and cargo mats fit perfect rear seat mats fit good enough in a 2015 Grand Cherokee Summit
B00X6DDXPC|5|Very nice I would recommend! I did not use the 2 small
B007S2VD4K|5|Thanks, just what i needed
B00BKW444A|5|Added this to my pontoon cantilever lift. Works perfect. Not sure on pontoon weight, but guessing its 2500lbs. It grunts a little at 20-30 degress, most likely from my worn out sheaves. Wireless remote is great. Pontoon is in the water by the time I get to it. Would not suggest on verticle lift because the weight is always on the winch unlike the cantilever where the weight gets transferred to the lift pivot points. I usually leave the carrige supports at 80 degress.
B001DRLBGG|5|Have always trusted AC Delco parts. They seem to be well made at a fair price. I expect these to hold up for a long time like all their other products I have used.
B000BGK2U6|5|The toilet is an exact match for a 1985 Thetford, fit the RV perfectly
B000GZWXUO|2|not very reliable.
B00CEX58EE|5|Look great
B008MOB6JK|4|Fits nice, on my Hummy, just a bit pricy $$
B00AWXZ9MO|5|It was perfect !!!
B0016LG0CY|3|This item ships with Non Insulated crimped fittings. I could not find corresponding fitting that fit into uninsulated terminals. Useless and a great waste of tome. I wound up cutting the terminals off and used a butt crimped fitting to secure this to my CB radio power cord. The wires are quite short. Care must be taken when cutting and stripping the ends. I've had no fuse issues in this application. Bottom line fittings are not compatible with ay corresponding ones I could find in the stores here. AND the supplied fittings are NOT insulated.
B004STOM58|5|STICKS WELL,HEAVY METAL,QUALITY
B00636BNUQ|4|Just what you expect.<br />Good quality but I think the logo might come off in a few months on the wrench.<br />Only time will tell. Great quality.
B000778LC0|3|The image showed the item to be true white in color; however, the delivered item was a yellowed, off-white.
B00M42CLXQ|4|Not hard to install. I haven't found the right way to get water spots off them after washing the truck. They work great and look great!
B0016H0O6G|5|Arrived in a hurry. Easy to install.
B00BMTZRWY|2|Need a better unit,did not work well on a 2004,A4 quatro. Will be returning and purchasing a step up unit
B00D8FR34K|5|Exactly what I ordered. Very bright and work well.
B000CSWAOY|5|fit great
B004A2GOK4|4|No issues as a direct replacement for a 2011 Ford F-250 Diesel.
B003S8B352|5|worked great
B0024E6UE0|5|Works as advertised.
B009SX3P6Q|5|Estan al 100
B004DRVGHM|4|great product even comes with bulbs
B00PUOQRK8|5|I got this for my husband to put on his car seat after his mountain bike rides. He loves it.
B00EWNFLJ6|5|Very easy to install, and looks great!
B00FZM54WM|5|this item was the correct item to pass emissions standards.
B001N0E188|5|Just what I needed
B00E1ZRQL6|5|Excellent service by manufacturer and seller. Recommend both to any biker out there! Outstanding
B0080E6YVW|5|Perfect fit for my 1991 Porsche 911 964 Coupe. Would definitely purchase this item again.
B006R5LND0|4|easily installed and looks good. i recommend four per trailer to get air flow. 2 high and 2 low and your good to go. a bit pricey for preformed plastic but it is what it is.
B00KMBPA9I|2|The product was not up to my  expectations, if fact I was dissapointed in the quality of the lights.
B000FQ1NN2|5|Fit perfectly.
B00SY3VP9K|5|guud
B00KDNTW6C|5|This is just what I was looking for!  It fit my 2012 ninja 1000 perfectly and I didn't have to pay over a 100.00 for it either! The instructions stink but it's a quality kit that even has adaptors for the oem turn signals.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay over a 100 bucks!  Well worth the money.
B000E4CNWA|5|Good as OEM. Easy to install and works great.
B001TZBQ0S|5|Good towel, nice and thick, soft and works well. I find that I can dry my car (WRX) with this towel quite well, following up with a regular sized MF towel to get the last of the streaks and beads of water. Chemical Guys make good products, hard to go wrong with them.
B00AQ29DJG|2|Did not fit my car as was advertised
B00THH9I7I|5|I've got a pile of air gauges. Why? Because I keep trying to find something that works well on motorcycle tire stems. So far I am pretty happy with this one. It is simple, accurate, sturdy and it fits the stem and seals easily enough.
B007WMFLHQ|5|Nice
B000XEU8FK|5|I'm a technician at a Toyota dealership and use this socket a lot removing axle nuts. Works perfect every time!
B00CE3PKEC|5|A lot beefier than factory -- and greaseable, too!
B00LKXJ3DQ|3|It's very hard to mate this with my '07 Subaru. It works, it just requires a level of force I typically avoid when mating exposed electrical pins, since, you know, they bend.<br /><br />Other important note - if you plan on using this with an apple device, there are very VERY few options to choose from as far as apps are concerned. But for a $15 app, you can reset your DTC codes which is nice.
B00I8X5BMS|5|excellent product for price
B00THHL0P6|5|They are perfect. I love the look, the feel and the easy insulation.
B004A6BHU2|5|excellent product for price
B004Y9YIU6|5|Q250 Quadcopter running lights. Crash and replace, lol.
B00Y3QCKL4|5|It's sounds very good and it gives it a extra 3 hp
B00WR99152|5|Sonax use to be my go to but now I am just using this stuff. I spray it on and let it sit for a min or so. Then I agitate it and rinse it off. Wheels come out clean as hell every-time.
B00JS387FA|5|Trust me, this is INCREDIBLY easy and will absolutely solve your shifting problems.<br /><br />SYMPTOMS<br />Hesitant/stubborn shifting<br />Green &#34;D&#34; light flashes<br />Trouble codes P1739 & P1839<br />Lurching/shuttering at highway speeds<br /><br />HOW-TO<br />1. Raise TL from driver side (I used the pinch weld just behind the front wheel)<br />2. Remove front wheel<br />3. Carefully pry the plastic locking pin from the wheel well splash guard (located about the 11 o'clock position)<br />4. Pull down on splash guard flap and tuck it under the wheel hub<br /><br />[4TH GREAR SWITCH]<br />5. Squeeze & pull off the connecting wiring harness<br />6. Using a 22mm ratcheting/boxed wrench, slip it over the existing switch and break it loose (the switch should spin out easily)<br />7. Making sure to use the included washer, screw in the new switch and tighten it down with the wrench<br />8. Reattach the wiring harness<br /><br />[3RD GEAR SWITCH]<br />8. Using a 10mm socket and extensions, remove the 2 bolts holding the sensor cover hiding the 3RD gear switch<br />9. Trace that sensor cover down to a third bolt and remove that using a 10mm ratcheting wrench (DO NOT mix these up)<br />10. Pull that sensor cover away just enough to reach behind it, pop off the wiring harness from the existing switch<br />11. Finagle a 22mm deep well socket behind the sensor cover and slip it over the existing switch<br />12. Using the appropriate socket wrench, apply pressure and break it loose from the transmission<br />13. Before spinning it completely out, have the new sensor and washer readily available (a minimal amount of fluid will leak from this switch port, do the faster you can plug it with the new part the less you'll loose)<br />14. Making sure to use the included washer, screw in the new switch and tighten it down with the socket wrench<br />15. Reattach the wiring harness<br /><br />Now would also be an ideal time to get a transmission flush & fill if you haven't hadone in a while.<br /><br />I have to give credit to YouTube user &#34;fabolousg4ever&#34;. I probably wouldn't have attempted this had it not been for his video &#34;Acura tl transmission pressure switch tutorial&#34;.
B00LN3QE9O|1|This is a terrible product. I had to get replacements twice from them and out of the 6 lights they sent me every one of them collected water. Within a couple of days. Two of them completely went dead. Will not recommend this product. You get what you pay for.
B00CAKILAO|5|Super nice, able to cut to fit with lines, looks great- heavy- not cheaply made
B004VGAJOG|4|Good quality and easy to install. Have only had them for afew weeks will see how long they last.Overall great product and would buy again.
B006SA3T90|5|Great sticker resistant to weather and the adhesive is strong
B009OBVRY4|5|Its cheap and it works perfectly well for waxing and polishing.  I tried to use it with Meguiar's headlight restoration kit and it was a complete failure; just the wrong motion and you can't put enough pressure downward to use for that particular application (I ended up doing it by hand and it worked great by-the-way).<br /><br />Pads are ridiculously priced for a piece of foam...but hey...whatt ya gonna do?!  For a fraction of the price of an electric DA I can't complain.  RECOMMEND
B00A2EMPN4|5|The ATV was actually received earlier than the estimated arrival date. When I completed the assembly, it started with no problem and continues to run fine. Upon starting, I became aware that the pre-assembled choke mechanism on the hand grip must have been damaged during transit. I contacted customer service and the replacement part was mailed quickly. I have been happy with the ATV as well as the customer support.
B00CYW080Y|4|Fits good, looks good, hopefully it sticks on tight and won`t blow away :)
B00AKPMH1A|1|Lift is OK, but JACK Strips threads after 4/5 uses, I've had 3 jacks already, DONE
B00K1C1WC2|5|Light weight works well.
B00DZ7WAMG|4|I ordered this directly from the website, but I wanted to make sure and post a review.  This kit works great and was easy to install on my 96' Honda Magna.  Took me an hour or two to install (including a few beer breaks).  I love the new forward position of the foot pegs - much more comfortable then the stock location, and it looks better with all the added chrome and the new pegs.  My only complaint (and it's a minor one) is that the stock shift pedal had to be adjusted up a little on my bike in order to be able to downshift properly without the pedal hitting the mounting bracket.  This makes it a little awkward when downshifting, but after seeing how awesome the new foot pegs look, I already placed an order for some new matching shift/brake pedals as well.  I had the issue that the crabby guy who gave this 1 star in his review was complaining about and the extra bolt they sent with the kit worked fine to resolve it.  As for the packing materials, I have no problem with newspaper and paper towels if it keeps the price of the kit down.  Everything arrived in excellent condition and no scratches on any of the hardware.
B000BUU5Z4|3|Works pretty well, but my toothbrush falls through.
B00UHXS3I6|4|The cover arrived on time. It fits snug. The color matches the truck Interior perfect. The only complaint is that the lid does not close all the way. It sits flat but won't latch. As the material stretches and flattens it might close easier and completely.
B0009IR0HE|3|This product has great look, let lacks durability. However since the product is aluminum, you are paying for the durability of aluminum.
B00UEC87QS|1|These are junk they don't fit the openings!  And to return them you have to mail them to China at your expense which cost more than the original cost of the item!!  I guess they will go in the trash!
B00F7HD8AA|5|Hilarious bumper sticker. Great quality.
B0009JN2GG|3|Works well, but falls out of the holder so I keep in glove box till I need it.
B00BCRMBGQ|1|Very cheaply made. Back seat cover doesn't fit.
B00TDDCGNO|5|We just replaced about every light in our 1991 Coachman with the Warm White and they look great.<br />Not to bright or stark white and the less strain on the battery will be great. In the fogged dome, you cannot see the individual lights so it defuses well.<br />I would recommend these to anyone who wants to replace them less and get better battery life.
B00JDPOVHG|5|no problems-thank you!
B006H34BUY|4|It's okay! Considering the price, its not that cheap, i thought this would be really good. But its just ok.
B00LD7UIYW|3|yea know it sticks so i guess it is okay.
B001AX65QO|3|Does not fit 3.00&#34;. Dont try it unless you want to return item. It will fit anything lower though. Good quality.
B008YZFFJY|4|Not a 50liter for sure, only a 30liter, but a great bag
B00PPVCJ80|1|These are advertised as fitting a 6mm hole, but they absolutely do not fit a 6mm hole.  After cleaning off the mold flash and squeezing the tabs as tight as possible with calipers (with the fastener in insertion position), the smallest diameter I could measure is 6.47mm.  I could not force this into the 6mm holes on my bike.  I'm not sure it's even worth returning them
B00OZ42J4C|4|Good if you just have snow. If you get freezing rain and then snow it will possibly be stuck to your windshield afterwards. However, don't let that stop you from getting it because this will minimize any scrapping you have to do due to ice.
B005VKLGUW|3|I thought the key was removable. so I could put a new key in.
B00G8PBLXQ|5|Excellent Quality, stands up to harsh weather and still looks good.  I live in the Northeast, drive 40,000 miles a year.  I never thought I'd get excited about a license frame, but this thing looks brand new a year later!  Really nice.
B000XQ9MGE|4|Working fine so far
B0009JKISQ|5|top notch,<br /><br />only need a small amount for each seat so considering i will be using it 3-4 times a year it should last a while!
B00CPL7D16|5|no review would do justice to such a cheap but effective product
B00VTT8NY6|5|Awesome product.
B00NFFXVRG|4|They look pretty
B007RW3KJM|3|This filter is for the engine, not the cabin. Works well in the proper application.
B010UJRLWA|5|Ok....
B001TANEOO|4|Pleasantly surprised of the output for the price of the bulbs.
B0046ZIW0U|5|I had a slight bit of fear this would sound really &#34;ricey&#34;, but to my surprise when I turned the car on, it had a nice low tone! No gurgle like a v8, but nice sound for a 4 cylinder.
B00CBTRMZ4|4|Works good
B00D8WHI8O|5|thanks
B001C97V4Q|5|Bought this for my 2005 Subaru Outback 3.0 H6. Make sure to get a thermostat for the factory recommended temperature. My Subaru is to be 172F which this thermostat is.
B0067MW1CK|5|Worked perfectly and was very easy to install. It only took about 5 minutes. I have used them several times now with a stand and they hardly show any wear or scuffing. Easy and affordable upgrade.
B00INZ65B2|5|very good would order from you again
B00BD4SLV2|1|Waste of money.  Cheap and do not fit the standard seat of the Mazda Miata. Customer service is even worse when you try and return the item.
B00KJBC8MS|5|Quick easy to do business with Works great
B006OQ35GU|4|This allows me to see when the black water runs clear and solids free after flushing my tank.
B007NMGZFM|5|Worked as expected.
B00BCVPVGY|5|Good mix
B008F07OMO|5|Product available on time, has been installed and is working great.
B00PTSW16E|4|happy
B00A2DWJU4|5|The cover is very durable, it is a good product, very easy to use.
B00A740VQM|5|Perfect
B000CMHVGM|5|Works perfectly
B0012ETJ1O|5|Great replacement headlights. Fast shipping, smooth transaction. Thanks.
B00MX6Q5RQ|5|Yes, I am a oil snob ... for 15 years I have used nothing but Valvoline Syntech in the cars, the motos and even in the generator. I read so many good reviews on this oil that I decided to try it. Now I don't see anything like the reviews claim such as a quieter engine, more fuel efficiency or smoother take-offs. Quite frankly I think this is in people's heads (especially when it comes to motorcycles) the long term effect will be how long the engine lasts and that's all there is to motor oil -- &#34;TO REDUCE FRICTION AND WEAR&#34; less friction equals less heat. So no one can predict how well an engine oil will do for you without some mileage behind it. So far, I am a believer.
B00QX619UK|5|Perfect
B00LCFHMNU|5|packaging was very weak, but the product itself is great
B000E7WLJW|5|Lots of room to store stuff.
B005GLP4QI|2|Installation was easy on my 2013 Ram 3500, not enough dampers.The device is not working as the video shows. The gate still slams. Very much disappointment in this product.
B000E4KJLM|5|Great product selection and great prices; delivery never a problem!
B00K3HFADM|5|Great and powerfull
B00UUKGC0C|1|Does not fit 2012 f150
B003Y8D8GI|5|Great look so I can live with the limited view.
B00G35E0AW|5|good bye
B007IVS6XW|5|Perfect fit matches exactly.
B000GTOSTE|5|Good deal
B00DGVRXD2|5|Great gas can spout.  These new spouts suck!
B00KSSYNIE|2|Weak low light.
B00T0TYH5Q|1|THIS WAS FALSE.  THE BLACK COLORED , IS NOT.
B0021J13O0|4|So far. No problems. The price was good compared to others.
B009X23B2U|5|Looks great! Easy to install.
B009434IN4|5|PERFECT FIT on my '98 Tacoma! Awesome price too!
B002ZTM82W|5|installed on my bikee
B00UM9LS5U|5|They looked great! I'm very happy with them
B001ROVBG0|1|This cover started to come apart and melted with sun and heat.  The leather is not real leather but rather a black glue material that will get all over your hands and clothes if exposed to heat/sun.
B0006Z9SQ6|5|This is a must have for our boats, jet ski, and car.  Does a wonderful job of keeping leather or vinyl protected and in good shape.
B008BVNMBO|4|for universal fitting its not bad, good for the price and at least my cloth seats will last. Used on a 2006 Kia Sedona. Was fairly easy to install.
B000A8OGMU|4|works well for what i wanted to do, nice and well made.
B009F0EEOO|5|good quality at an excellent price
B007T7TPE4|5|Fast shipping and Work great
B00HVHOJHU|3|I like the purpose of it but the quality is not good, everything sticks to it, dust, pollen, dirt :-(  - irem was shipped on time...
B0002Z9MJI|5|Did not come with advertised mounting hardware. In retrospect, I am not sure it would have worked as well as using self-drilling metal screws, which is what I did to mount the box. It is well constructed and will serve my needs well. By complaining about the lack of mounting hardware, I received a 20% credit which also made the price reasonable.
B00PCO4DFM|5|Makes it easy to dress the tires the angle is just right
B0026N38KS|5|My 95' Dodge Ram 2500 Cummins had an issue with going in and out of overdrive while simply going down the road.. very annoying, but it seems to be a common problem with these trucks. We replaced the TPS with this one and it instantly solved the problem, along with shifting smoother as well. Can't beat the price either!
B000R5G0DO|4|While it did not contain all the adapters that I needed, I am still very pleased with all of the items especially the easy to read gauges themselves.
B00XULVDHK|5|Just as expected!
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Love this beach blanket.  Sand does not stick to it.  Folds up easily so you can carry it with the handle.
B00B2HM3IM|5|I've been using Remflex gaskets for years and these are no different.  They work perfectly!!
B0013RLL1G|5|Easy to use and they work perfectly. I should have bought these a LONG time ago!
B00XJTX87G|5|Loved the cushion covers. Just wish we could find some for the back!
B002QUJ92C|5|I really like them , they are small but keeps the air out of my eyes so I can wear contacts
B002XLGR2O|4|Worked perfectly as a replacement for the original that broke.
B001715RQS|5|It worked like everyone said. Even works with Bose despite what it says. The weird thing is that I have the tech package in my 11 Mazdaspeed 3 it will turn my amp on when I'm near my car or unlock it (due to the proximity sensor in the key being read by the car)
B0024NSLJ8|5|Lights work really well. Had to adjust them but they are so much better than the originals. Well worth the money and very easy to install. Took about 10 minutes. You might have to use some elbow grease to push them in to the right spot, but very easy to change.<br />Bright and dim bulbs came with the lights, had to reuse the marker and turn lights.
B0054YCW62|4|Not much to say, works as advertised.
B000IJJ2FC|3|I swapped out my stock SRT Jeep pads for these because the dust was driving me insane.  The good news is these pads have very little dust and they seem to stop as well as stock.  The bad news is, after a quiet first week they now squeak pretty badly about half the time.  Annoying.  I've written to the Hawk customer service department but have yet to hear back.
B00BN5XV0M|3|I think the helmet was too tight. I then had to pay for return shipping because I did not want to keep an uncomfortable helmet.
B002DOME1E|5|very good to have
B00PV5DFUQ|4|Front floor mats were perfect for my Jeep but...back mat didn't quite fit.
B002LEEXAQ|1|most of the color cam off within the first 2 weeks
B00JH2GMMC|5|Perfect fit and much better than buy it from the dealer.
B005N766KI|1|Received as a gift. I too order a size larger than necessary and it didnt fit me at all. crack and cheek were hanging out.<br /><br />The material isn't comfortable either.
B00BUFWN5E|5|I would recommend to anyone with matte black paint.  I use it on my harley and it's the best soap I've ever used.  Their spray detailer is pretty sweet too
B00GUPIFS8|5|Solid aluminum buckets allow for good reflector chrome, clear lenses. One of those &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; since these are not cheap.<br /><br />Vehicle: 2000 Jeep Cherokee.
B00XNF48YS|5|Works great, no problems fast service.
B000C5C862|5|Exact replacement great fit and EZ install.
B003FNS7O0|5|High quality, match my M brakes on my 228i.
B007TS6FNW|4|Could use a stiffer &#34;Frame&#34; inside, but still the nicest bag I could find.
B00K889FCI|1|After sanding the lights with the provided buffing pad. I opened the pack with the yellow towel to use the &#34;wipe new&#34; and the towel was already completely DRY .. The package was completely sealed prior to opening. Now I have hazy lights and nothing to renew it with. The other box which I used a few weeks ago worked as described.
B002SYUDZI|5|worked fine
B00CS7T0IQ|5|Very nice
B00IENRRWY|1|Cheap Material.
B00USNP6M6|4|I like them a lot, the only reason I gave a 4 star instead of a 5 star is that they don't come with any mounting hardware.
B000KPVFG8|5|This is a great Jack for me...
B00TRRST4G|1|This item was made out of cheap thin metal and bent so I had to buy one from a junk yard that has been working great ever since. I wouldn't recommend  this item :(
B00976L174|1|was not the right size, to small, appear larger in picture.
B000MIT5VA|3|Not very loud but fits well with my roll bars. Need to add instructions and better mounting hardware, FYI.
B00BFE4NRG|5|Awesome product. Plug and play.
B005CD4TTI|5|Yes I received them and I loved them. I gave one to each one of my daughters too . Now no more losing my car in the parking lot. Thank you so much. Very pleased.
B0009IBJE4|5|Very light, compact, and a lot more features than my old charger. Tells if connected correctly and when the battery is charged. Also has three charging levels versus the usual two. The storage area for the cords is an excellent idea versus them always in the way after use.
B0042A0W8Y|4|This works.
B00L3O2MBC|1|The bars look great but they do not fit on a club car precedent. There's no where to bolt them up to and without install instructions it's impossible
B004AIDBZO|2|Need to return but missed the date. The mechanic was wrong with the part needed now its a computer issue so this is a wasted purchase and i missed the return. It looks nice i guess, clean as expected.
B00KDRDZES|5|That was the product I expected.
B001AMA6GU|5|These shocks fit my '61 Plymouth Belvedere perfectly.  They were on back order from another company for a month.  I should have ordered from Amazon from the start!
B00EA2VVES|5|Matches interior perfect!!! Same pattern,turns heads
B006ELQYZO|5|Ordered this as a birthday gift for my boss- it looks flawless on her new Stang!!
B00OJ9MWUE|4|Perfect for keeping things dry
B0010E00T6|5|perfect replacement for my 2013 Honda pilot
B00JPOOR2O|4|Could have been a little more glitzy but am happy with it. I couldn't use the caps it came with cause I have different screws. Looks ok anyway.
B00AWI7II2|3|Does block sunlight but not all of the heat.
B00E9FSCDY|3|ok
B00J3QM4OC|4|It worked as expected it is very sensitive so I have to turn down the sensitivity
B00069QLVC|5|Tried this out on my Jeep. Now I can hear the next loudest source of noise
B001EU8NSG|5|just as described
B00COGK3O6|1|After all of the reviews, I chose to try this to seal around a roof vent on our travel trailer.  I watched videos and read quite a bit about this product before choosing to go with it.  I will not use it again.  Within 24-30 hours, it is not staying attached.  It went on like it would do fine.  It just isn't going to hold.  And, yes!  I followed all the advice on cleaners and applying pressure, etc.  It just isn't going to work on our EPDM roof.
B008RRM3XA|5|Very comfy and hold up good. Love them
B0036C612U|5|GREAT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL
B000182DII|5|very good
B00ISJX764|3|They look sweet, but the dinting make the lights a bit too dim at night.
B002302KK8|5|I used this mirror to replace the OEM one on my '08 KLR 650. It does require one to remove the damper adapter for the stock mirror, so the view is a little fuzzier than stock. So far its worked well. You will have to adjust the tension after a while, but that was pretty easy. The only downside  I had was that it doesn't reach out any farther than the stock mirror, which is what I was looking for. Not something that's this mirror's fault.
B000GU3KHE|5|Excellent size for my Honda Rebel!!!
B00YTZDMZW|2|Not a bad looking product, arrived in a timely manner, but the installation is where I ran into problems. The frame on my 2004 GMC Sierra 1500 4x4 has  joggle step in the front between where the front bolt goes through to the tow hook and the rear hole that the other bolt was suppose to goes through. That aside, I couldn't even get it to mount correctly to the front without it rubbing and being pressed up against the factory bumber in the front. After some modifications to the vehicle and some washers used in key areas of the installation, it now fits like it's suppose to.
B00CBLW3EW|5|Works, I mean really works. After a few months in storage this thing will fill up with water as it captures moisture.
B005G2R0EG|5|Fantastic sound. It isn't truly that much louder for engine noise, but it will let you here that sexy turbo spool, whine, whistle and sneeze :) Good throttle response as well. The black looks great under the hood.
B004HAG7K6|5|Very happy with the product and with the results
B000XQ2S4M|5|Great price, Great product
B00OGNM04Q|3|This is my arch enemy of the Chryler 200. I have gone through 4 of these with what i feel is normal wear. at 69000 miles on my 2011, I drive to work heading south in the morning and north at night. The glare of the sun is through my side window so  some days i unclip my visor and move it to my side window to block the sun when it is bad, maybe 2-3 times a week. the clasp is just poorly designed and it snaps in hard no matter how gently i do it. It splits at the same point each time. this is the second clasp i orderd from Amazon, and this one seems the same as the others, but so far has been the most forgiving after 2 months. The items I have got are listed as genuine mopar, the same that came with the car. good price from the seller i got if from (under 10) so cheeper than my dealer wanted marked up.
B0007RDVH0|5|Great price, Great product
B000C53S1G|4|they fit
B0095TC6I6|5|very smart way of mounting the mirrors: safe and quick
B00TFZ847M|5|Came as described.  Easy to install.  Bright white light versus the old, dingy, yellowish looking light of the original bulbs.Extremely satisfied.
B0013JDHIE|5|Seems to work well!
B00AZ5TXJE|5|Great price!  Great product!
B00802NCB4|3|I got the backrest for my wife when we ride. While it looks good she does not find it very comfortable and I wish there was another cushion for the top case.  The backrest is not a good deal for the price.
B00K16FC7Y|5|STP long time auto supplier so this works fine as well
B00HWPYU6Q|1|it took 3 times writing emails before the product finally arrived.  it lasted about 10 days, after going through an automatic car wash, the decal washed off.
B004VRS8RU|5|Nice &#34;throaty&#34; sound without too much resonance in the cab (there is some resonance). Matched product specifications exactly.
B00FYX270Y|4|Work great probably! Have to do some cutting on them to install! No fold down in Rear seat Acess! fyi.
B00MJ5APF4|5|Bought this for my son.  It kept him warm and dry all snowmobile season and he just loves the look of it.
B0070Y36WI|5|Good product
B01092IEEM|3|It had a mark on the front seat cushion and the rear seats were not custom fit.
B009PIHJO8|4|These are a good value.  Less expensive than some brands but still do a great job protecting the vehicle and fit very well in my 2015 Chevy malibu.
B009TA83CO|5|perfect fit!
B000EEU0IO|4|Well made, the right size for our car seats.
B00HEDUCPO|4|This replacement part works well. Amazon should change the description as it is actually the driver door side. I confirmed with Dorman on part numbers before ordering to be sure I was getting the driver side as needed. It still leaves some question as to wether it is correct until you get it in your hands. It fit fine and works well. Only complaint I had was that the drive cables do not have the same amount of insulation on them to prevent noise. The drive cables were rattling in the door so bad I could not stand it and had to pull the door apart again to wrap some foam pipe insulation on  them. All is quiet now. Norman parts are usually reliable and a good fit. It is disappointing they missed the boat on the insulation. Nissan had it on there for a reason. If you need one then go for it. Much cheaper than Nissan. Don't be afraid of installing it yourself. Although I am a mechanic, I believe anyone with a reasonable amount of mechanical aptitude could install this.
B005XH6QZ8|4|Only problem is a bracket screw that is too long and &#34;bottoms&#34; out prematurely. Plus, the bracket requires 2 screws but only one is supplied. This is my second strut. I replaced the other side last fall and it has survived one pothole-ridden new england winter well so far.
B00HQZ9XHS|4|First off, these look awesome. I installed these on my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland (20&#34; rims) a in about August/September 2015 and they are definitely a stretch to get on the rear - the front fit fine. I'm not comfortable with how the rear set fits as they seem to have a little wiggle because the mounting brackets had to be stretched so much. I wish they were a bit longer so I didn't have to bend them so much. Bottom line: they look great but I wish they fit better. I would recommend as long as yours fit the way they should.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/21/2016 - It's been about 6 months and they are still on, still have perfect color and I still get compliments. Haven't had to adjust them once so the brackets are holding up thus far. Will update if anything changes. I also uploaded a picture.
B007HG80U2|5|fantastic piece great price
B00FWOKKGI|5|Works awesome for hunting Sasquatch!
B002J9FJRO|5|finally
B00JBHA83C|5|Part was just as described.  No issues.  So far has worked flawlessly.
B000NKU13S|5|Does what it is supposed to do. Good price
B000ZZWNYG|5|This stuff worked BETTER than WD40!!  I had to replace my almost 15 yr old kitchen faucet and the bolts under the sink had rusted through.  I had watched youtube videos on how to replace it and Liquid Wrench was mentioned in one of them.  Sprayed it on, waited about 10 mins and slowly got the old rusted bolts off.  On one of them I had to repeat the process to get everything removed, and this stuff worked great!!!  BTW - I'm a gal so you have to know this really worked!!
B004L04YCK|5|Very pleased. I put one on my old Airstream to test it and it looks & works great. It's brighter than the original incandescent, uses less power, and is WAY more water resistant. Since my original was a one-wire setup I pulled the black wire to the inside and added a eye that goes on the mounting screw. I will be ordering several more.  7/16 THAT WAS THEN! Now is different I guess... I ordered three of the red ones since I was pleased with the amber... bah. The red ones that just came had only two LEDs per light but worst of all they are not &#34;potted&#34; for water resistance. I was impressed with how the amber ones had potting material (epoxy?) completely encasing the circuit board so that WHEN water gets behind the lens it doesn't corrode and short out. I'd be surprised if this batch lasts 2 years.
B005HFYE1O|5|These little babies do the trick!
B0014GDGPU|5|Received this item and the the other stickers.  Disregard last review
B002XG24YO|5|Best quality USAF sicker I have found!!
B00B0ZMKTS|4|Stows quickly bit watch you fingers.
B00EESQN2I|5|Received very quickly, especially for cross-country shipping. For a &#34;novelty&#34; helmet, its actually really well built too. extra cushioning around the side actually makes it feel like a DOT helmet, but top is shallow enough to make it fit like a novelty helmet. Strap and clip are very solid as well.
B00CHDGQVU|5|good fit
B001J5WXR8|1|Received the part broken
B00W67TKRE|5|Easy Install! Price was right! Looks much better than stock! A definite recommend!
B007S12QDS|5|I used these to replace the rubber footpegs on my '08 KLR 650. Easy install, seem very well made, and increase foot traction in the wet and mud. I think the only possible downside is that you may need to replace the shifter with a longer one (I did) if you have large feet (I do).
B000GANVR8|5|this board fit great on our rv furnace
B00FGR8XF6|1|one size fits all well no they did not fit. I am disappointment. delivery was great thought.
B00310R6N0|5|no problems-thank you!
B009SWFFUQ|4|excelente gracias
B00AHS66BM|5|Looks brand new again
B0002MABGE|5|Perfect for our needs!
B00317C0BQ|5|Shorter usable gears!  If you want to stay in the power band and love to shift your sled like a motocross bike this is your ticket!
B006NU3UOE|5|Let me just say I was not expecting the quality of this item. It came in the original gachapon bubble, complete with the informational booklet and decals of Sheryl. The figure is very small, but extremely detailed and made of light plastic. It doesn't look cheap, and it will definitely have a place on my backpack! As not much Macross F merchandise is brought to America, this is a wonderful chance to get it fairly cheap!
B0039L9PSU|5|You ain't splittin your case without it simple quick setup and adjustable way less time than making your own.
B00O6QK6VC|4|6376 brake kit, for 2014 XLT - good stopping power, rotors look great; be sure to lightly file/sand where rotor fits axle flange, then a touch of grease or anti-sieze on axle flange.  it will ease removal in future.
B0002SQUTU|5|I'm a technician at a Toyota dealership and use this at least once a day when doing a break job. I used to use big pliers but this is so much easier and way faster. Definitely would buy again!!
B00TEA5PZC|5|I ordered 2 of these frames to install on my new Subaru Forester. They are good quality, very shiny, and not too difficult for this 63 year old widow to install on her own. I had a question about the installation and heard back from Darius at DFDM quickly with clear instructions that answered my questions. Unfortunately, when I removed the dealers frame I found that there were only 2 holes screwed in the bumper and I had ordered the 4 hole stainless steel frames. It was my mistake and I was a little disappointed to now have my sleek new stainless steel frames missing screws and covers on the bottom. I emailed Darius back that his instructions enabled me to install the frames correctly and thanked him for his quick and clear reply. I also told him about my disappointment but was fully accepting of the less than perfect look. To my surprise he offered to ship me 2 new frames that were manufactured for 2 hole installations free of charge. I was amazed and overjoyed.  So here is an excellent product from a manufacturer with fantastic customer service who goes above and beyond to satisfy his customers!! What is there not to recommend!
B000CGIOLO|5|excellent product for price
B00K7YZQDK|5|worked perfectly!
B003072CME|2|The quality is acceptable for the price, unfortunately they screwed up on the model since i ordered 4 small size but i received 2 small and 2 fingerless models when i had in fact ordered 4 small true grip gloves.<br /><br />I later noticed that the fingerless models were labelled wrongly as the true grips.
B008KNBAYO|1|I've had two of these fail within the span of a week. First failed after four days of light use (less than 1 hour drive time and 25 miles). Second failed in less than 24 hours of installation (roughly 2 hours of drive time and 60 miles). Have confirmed that this is the problem as I have tested a known working OEM part on the car after both control module failures and the fans work perfectly. Have also tested both failed control modules on another car and with the engine completely cold and the key out of the car and the fans started up immediately. OEM is the way to go with this part, I have a car with +210K miles and the original fan control module in it and the fans work perfectly.
B003CK3QVU|5|Fixed my leaking problem perfectly. Perfect fit nice and tight on my pro action suspension on my 05 RM 125. Great product so far!
B0006JLU1I|5|Appears to be very well made and sturdy.  Many covers are made of very thin plastic and deteriorate quickly in the Arizona sun.  This one is heavy duty polycarbonate and should hold-up for a long time.  You may pay a little extra but it is well worth the money when it starts to rain or snow and you find that a cheap one has failed and everything inside is getting ruined.
B003PYR97A|4|Better than the old flimsy one I had. It is a quality made product but does not fit my windshield as custom as the company portrays. There are gaps all along the coverage. Better than most, just don't like the false advertising. I have a 2009 Venza.
B00192JGY4|5|How much propane is left?  This little easy to install gadget will tell you!
B000BZL08A|5|Works and it fits  my Jeep. I'm happy. Actually, ecstatic!  $50 cheaper than my local auto parts store.
B00PEFNSHS|5|My husband loves this Money Clip!
B00GSAUHB8|5|I purchased this for my new 2016 Ford Escape. Works great. Covers the entire windshield. No sharp edges to scratch the interior. Opens and closes easily. Stores in the carrier, it may take you a few tries to twist it closed properly, but I watched the video and after a couple attempts, no issues.
B006WKQZUQ|5|So far so good. The cover has weathered the hot summer sun and covers my 16 foot boat well.
B00P8BKUUG|4|Nice parts and price
B005C5FNB4|5|Pricey for what you got, but nicely made, fits backrest well.
B004PL1WCU|5|love it
B006XG5G9K|5|purchased this for my 84 FLT the difference is amazing. For the price it works well for me. Looks nice when off and good nighttime illumination (not the best but far better than the old school bulb my 84 had in it. I will continue to buy if I need a replacement
B0013COVUO|5|First I want to say that I was totally amazed by the delivery.  I have Amazon Prime and ordered on a Saturday for next day delivery.  USPS doesn't deliver to my door on normal days (1/2 mile dirt road), so I thought I was going to have to drive to the post office to get the device.  They dropped it on my porch 1120 AM the next day.  Device works great!  I've already done half of my testing.  The dial is easy to read and with the blue max torque needle it's easy to get the readings.  I'm using it to test torque and I can't see the dial while applying the torque, so the needle is essential.  Easy to reset to 0.
B007CLSJRQ|5|Happy we could purchase genuine Subaru parts from Amazon. We feel secure having them on our tires. They were easy for my husband to install.
B003SS2EBE|5|Present for my dad. He loves it!
B000C16XL2|2|so far so good!
B00BAX0MTA|5|Fits perfectly into my Chevrolet Sonic LTZ 4-Door sedan truck. Love this net, although installation can be a bit tricky. I was nervous ripping out all the plugs in my truck to insert the clips for this net. Overall, love the net and works just as I thought it would.
B00EHYS9QC|1|it sucks
B0002T8FII|5|Used Dri-Wash Guard products for years
B00ZVJ2T0O|4|look great, easy to install. The one size fits all approach fits well in a 2008 for focus se
B0012PT6QQ|5|Improved the ride on my pick up.
B00BAHVR86|1|I've read favorable reviews about these scratchers and the manufacturer standing behind their stuff (which is part of why I bought them in the first place), but I experienced neither.  These scratchers wouldn't stay orientated properly (I used red thread locker & torqued them down good) and I went through 2 sets of carbide tips before I threw what was left in the garbage where these belong.  Manufacturer was contacted via email after I lost the first set of tips on the first 100 mile ride (tips were gone by 50 miles).  They asked me a question, I responded, then never heard back from them.  I stupidly bought another set of tips on my own dime, those didn't last much longer before they were gone as well.  I'm glad these work for some people, but my experience couldn't have been worse and the lack of product support was really disappointing.
B004QP9GBE|5|Great Product
B00CFXYT3O|4|It's a good part. I mounted this one to my toolbox so that I could see where it was in the shop at a glance. the assembly was very sturdy, and I would trust it on a vehicle without hesitation.<br /><br />I think this would also be good attached to children or tourists, so that you can see where they are at all times.
B004KGEE5W|5|Had someone ask where I bought this. Love showing my support.
B00AQ47864|5|Fits and functions as discribed.
B000E347LQ|4|Nearly perfect, however, it did not come with the 10/24 bolts necessary to hold the top and bottom mounting locations for both regulator sliders in place. 4x 10/24 x 1&#34; bolts would have made the product perfect.
B00L1LQME0|5|just the right amount of bling for my aftermarket aluminum wheels. typical install
B000GZHD72|4|Not quite as good as factory number plate, but ok
B000CMHVJO|5|Works very well. Not too hard to install.
B002OUMVWY|4|Good hose and connections
B000F14B7C|5|as advirtised
B000C8ZE74|5|Direct fit for my 1992 ford ranger even though my truck does not have the stock muffler.
B003BZD08U|5|Great product!
B0068FW22U|5|My Harley Deuce has never run so well.  It does suck more gasoline though.  Sounds and looks great- I've had so many complements on this air breather.  Of course my Deuce is black and chrome, so it really pops on my bike as far as the looks go.  Very easy install!
B00V30J86I|5|Now my purse is tucked safely away not dumping all over the car I love is! Should be a factory installed feature on all cars!
B00DU6R7R0|5|I LOVE this helmet! At first it was a bit bigger and bulkier than my other helmets, but after putting it on, it felt like it wasn't even there! I use it when I ride it on my Grom, so the fatest I've taken it to has been 55mph and it has NO wind noise. It has great incoming vents and even just riding it yesterday in a bit of traffic, it hasn't fogged up! My head measures a 23&#34;, so I got the XL and I have long hair. If I would've gotten the L, I believe it would've been a bit tight. either way, no complaints about the helmet. Great product
B0002HRBSU|5|Good product.
B00C0T3C54|5|They fit !!!! and now my wheels are protected
B002LYQALQ|5|I ordered this for placement of oil on moving surfaces of firearms, as excess oil on non-load bearing areas only attracts dust and dirt.  This tool gets a thin film of oil right where you need it
B009FC8C5Y|5|New top fit perfectly! Makes my old jeepster look like new again! Thanks Amazon!
B004GDFCKA|5|Worked great! Thanks!
B00EECM5FI|5|Here's the deal. These bulbs are great. I was really pretty skeptical about TWO bulbs that cost 1/3 the price of a single bulb (from the dealer). The best price I could find for a name brand, single bulb, on Amazon was $50.<br />I read many reviews and was left less encouraged by the wildly differing opinions of these bulbs (as is typical of most aggregate reviews on the internet).<br />But I decided to get them anyway.<br />And I'm really glad I did.<br />They fire up fine, burn bright and are exactly as claimed.<br />I had no issues installing them, save for that on my car (2000 Audi A6), you need to have nimble fingers and a bit of patience to get in there to secure them.<br />If you don't know how to do basic stuff with your car (oil changes, tire changes, etc.), don't do this kind of stuff either...<br />Anyway, I am going to just go out and say this:<br />My guess is that anyone whose review of the bulbs was &#34;...they fired up fine, but burnt out after a few hours...&#34; or &#34;they were good for a few days...&#34; installed them wrong...<br />YOU MUST MAKE SURE TO NOT TOUCH THE GLASS PART OF THE BULB WITH YOUR FINGERS.<br />This is S.O.P. for any hi intensity, hot burning bulb, and is not anything new or earth-shattering in the lighting world.<br />The oils from your skin / finger prints will remain on the glass, heat up and burn super hot, causing the bulb to fail.<br />Wipe the bulb glass with a clean, soft cloth before installing, being very careful to not touch it again during the installation process. This will make it more difficult, so, again, if you are unsure of your abilities, leave it to someone who knows what they're doing.<br />Also, (in my opinion- there are many about this topic) it's a good idea to use bulb grease on the electrical / connection part of the bulb, as well as any plastic retaining ring's tracks. My thought is less about preventing corrosion on the electrical fitting (which is rare), but more about making it easier for you torotate the bulb into its secure position within the light housing, and allowing for the retaining ring to easily rotate to its locked position.<br />Sorry for the long write-up. Thanks for reading, and good luck.
B004M5SHZE|1|Very disappointed . Spent money on really small peaces of junk dont buy it.
B00JS358WA|5|Trust me, this is INCREDIBLY easy and will absolutely solve your shifting problems.<br /><br />SYMPTOMS<br />Hesitant/stubborn shifting<br />Green &#34;D&#34; light flashes<br />Trouble codes P1739 & P1839<br />Lurching/shuttering at highway speeds<br /><br />HOW-TO<br />1. Raise TL from driver side (I used the pinch weld just behind the front wheel)<br />2. Remove front wheel<br />3. Carefully pry the plastic locking pin from the wheel well splash guard (located about the 11 o'clock position)<br />4. Pull down on splash guard flap and tuck it under the wheel hub<br /><br />[4TH GREAR SWITCH]<br />5. Squeeze & pull off the connecting wiring harness<br />6. Using a 22mm ratcheting/boxed wrench, slip it over the existing switch and break it loose (the switch should spin out easily)<br />7. Making sure to use the included washer, screw in the new switch and tighten it down with the wrench<br />8. Reattach the wiring harness<br /><br />[3RD GEAR SWITCH]<br />8. Using a 10mm socket and extensions, remove the 2 bolts holding the sensor cover hiding the 3RD gear switch<br />9. Trace that sensor cover down to a third bolt and remove that using a 10mm ratcheting wrench (DO NOT mix these up)<br />10. Pull that sensor cover away just enough to reach behind it, pop off the wiring harness from the existing switch<br />11. Finagle a 22mm deep well socket behind the sensor cover and slip it over the existing switch<br />12. Using the appropriate socket wrench, apply pressure and break it loose from the transmission<br />13. Before spinning it completely out, have the new sensor and washer readily available (a minimal amount of fluid will leak from this switch port, do the faster you can plug it with the new part the less you'll loose)<br />14. Making sure to use the included washer, screw in the new switch and tighten it down with the socket wrench<br />15. Reattach the wiring harness<br /><br />Now would also be an ideal time to get a transmission flush & fill if you haven't hadone in a while.<br /><br />I have to give credit to YouTube user &#34;fabolousg4ever&#34;. I probably wouldn't have attempted this had it not been for his video &#34;Acura tl transmission pressure switch tutorial&#34;.
B00APOFQYQ|5|Perfect match to the original with an easy, ten minute, two screw, installation.
B008032QSI|5|Pulled the bed off to replace the part.  Bolted right in place, all holes lined up no problem.  Very happy with the purchase. 97 ranger xlt 4.0
B007R2TSCU|5|Worked beyond what I expected gave the codes quick and was able to pinpoint what was wrong with my truck is buy another one its just that good
B001GKHJJ8|5|This is a great product! I was stuck with the dreaded hanging hitch plug and even one time it came loose from its hiding spot that I used before this box and I drug it for a miles ruining the end. This box is a great way to hide that unsightly hanging cord.
B002J7KCOG|5|Great quality and price!
B002L1H55O|5|great
B004GCF1CK|5|Was perfect and shipped fast
B00OCYXTYY|3|In Android, I think a lot of work to use it with wifi connection, together with the internet, and consume a lot of battery smartphone.
B003L2ZQBM|5|Works well, filters better than a standard filter.
B00AQB8JFQ|4|lights are fine , not as bright as I wanted
B00662CAV8|5|Thanks for perfect deal and delivery in time

B002SA0Y3I|5|perfect replacement

B00FFSXCK2|4|Great sound and looks awesome.<br />Fitment could have been better. Took a few tries to get lined up but all went well.
B00BH0KPKW|3|They look and fit great. As others have posted, the antilock piece quickly rusts, ruining the aesthetic. I'll probably just take those pieces off
B00UJ9WJBU|5|Perfect part for my scooter  thanks
B001VXY88A|4|Works as expected
B00JH23J78|5|fit right into my Suzuki Bandit 1250. No more slow cranking on old battery.
B0009XB3UE|4|i use this for models and its a bit thick for the details to show clearly enough.
B00H4E9QBE|5|It's easy to put on and looks great!
B002J8LMVC|4|I bought this for my boat and have not had to use it there, but the other day my truck alternator went bad on the way home from work, and the next day it wouldn't start. I used the jump starter to boost it and it fired right up, unfortunately the alternator was so bad I didn't make it to the garage. I think I'm going to like this jump starter very well.
B00E2TSPQQ|3|I like these lights, but I'm going to start with the dislikes. These are advertised as 48w lights, but at 12 volts, they only draw 2.95a. That comes out to 35w. If they say 48w then that's what they should be. Otherwise it's false advertising. They are also supposed to be 60 degree floods. Says so on the box, No way, definately spot beams. Also one has a slightly more greenish tint than the others. On the good side, they seem to be constructed well, and do put out a lot of light. I mounted two on my mower to replace the old incandescent ones, and there's no comparison. I am going to mount the other two I bought on my plow truck for rear lights. I think my main gripe is the beam pattern. They'll work, but floods would be better. As far as I can tell, all these style lights for sale are all pretty much identical. I'm sure they all come from the same Chinese factories. They all show the same pictures with minor variations, mine are slightly different than the ones shown on the listing. As usual, Amazon Prime delivered super fast, actually faster than promised.
B001VBYSLE|5|Beautiful!! Am ordering more for the rest of the family
B000C767O4|5|Easy to install and bleed.  Would buy them again.
B00GMO4DC4|2|Inferior quality.  Much too expensive.  Thin plastic, easily broken.
