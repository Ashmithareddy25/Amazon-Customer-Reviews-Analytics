0671042858|1.0|This book should not be in the Hot Horror section of Stephen King's novels.  There is nothing horrific in it.  It's about a little girl lost in the woods, period.  I kept waiting for something to happen.  It's a good  thing I was listening to it on a CD when I exercise and just kept on  listening until I was finished, otherwise it would have been one of those  books you get a few chapters into and never open it again.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I'm a major rap fan, but i got this just to see if it was as good as blood sex suger magic. It was phenenomal compared to the rest of my alternitive cd's and this and everclear's so much for the afterglow are the only non  rap/rock cd's i'll listen to. The cd also doesn't rely on the 4 or 5 best  songs to be good, i like just about every one of them except scar tissue  which ive listened to way to much. I hope there next cd will be just as  good.
0440234743|3.0|Grisham's latest.  An enjoyable, fast read.  The story of a wealthy, self-made man whose assets must be distributed to his heirs.  The man changes his will at the last minute leaving his legitimate heirs next to  nothing.  Instead he leaves almost everything to his unknown, illegitimate  daughter working as a remote missionary in Brazil.  <br />I was impressed with  Grisham's willingness to develop thought and dialogue around the topics of  religious faith and alcohol abuse.  It was an earnest attempt to explore  two unlikely components of a best seller.  I give him high marks for using  his skill and characters to openly discuss the sensitive subjects.
630196697X|5.0|Shot in just ten days on the mean streets of NYC, this Samuel Fuller film epitomizes the essence of noir.  Grifters, detectives, and spies emerge as stark characters interwoven in a plot tainted with desperation, betrayal,  and loneliness.  Pick Up On South Street is the canvass that reveals urban  realism painted in its most blackest and whitest.  Every aspect of the  film-from the gritty on site location shooting to the effective use of  close up facial shots warrants uncompromising attention.  Manhattan's  apartments, streets, subways, and harbor are masterfully landscaped into a  montage of darkened shadows highlighted by light grays and luminious  whites. Richard  Widmark has never been better as Skip McCoy the two-bit  pickpocket whose multi-layered persona slowly unravels within this seventy  minute thriller. Jean Peters is equally convincing as the street tough who  conceals her vunerability with a tight dress and a loose mouth.  Thelma  Ritter steals every scene she appears in as the aging grifter who has the  dope on every hood worthy of a police record.  At the time of the film's  release (1953) American loyalty and patriotism in society was being tested  by the fervor caused by McCarthyism. A shift from the threat of gangsterism  to Communism had engulfed the American psyche.  The FBI had proclaimed that  the most notorious gangsters from John Dillinger to Al Capone no longer  roamed the country.  Instead an even more menacing evil was threatening the  sanctity and integrity of American morality and only a vigiliant public- be  it cops or crimminals could combat this covert force. In the wake of the  McCarthy hysteria, a pickpocket was frowned upon,a Red was condemned to  purgatory.  No film captured the triangle of forces- crime, Communism, and  American justice as deftly as Pick Up On South Street.  For all fans of  noir classics, this is one to own and enjoy.
B000002HMH|5.0|Ok, what just happened? Where is everything that Metallica stood for in it's glory days? Well, On S&amp;M, James says that they do Kinda Heavy, why not change METALLICA to KINDAHEAVYICA....  Ok, now on to LOAD..i dont know  what to say. After listening to this album, how can you even romantaze (SP)  about your so-called love for the Black Album? i must say that the Black  Album is good, but anybody who says they love the album and can name only  singles...well, dont DESERVE to listen to Load. I do admit that Ride,  Master, ...And are my fave's, but, come on. They are getting old.  Now, on  to the actual music. If you cant see the Heavy-ness to this album, you are  dead from the head-up, or you've listened to the Black Album to much. I  must admit, it took me three years to come around to Metallica, and when my  brother bought this album in '96, we didnt like it. It earned a place in  the bottom of the pile. Now, its 1999, and my brother buys S&amp;M, and i  come around to Metallica. So i take out this album, and i cant get into it.  But then, for some reason, i get to listen to REload, and i love it. So, i  take it out again. I cant see how these two were supposed to be togeather!  There really no relationship between them. Now, i listen to Load once more,  and i'm hooked. I hate Country, but love Mama Said. Even songs i dont like  when i first heard them, now i love. This Album is contagouis!(SP) SO, i  advise you to take a good listen to Load, and Stop listening to the Black  Album. And, yes i am saying this after hearing ALL the albums over and over  and over again.  And I dont see how people can make a connection to James's  sheepish voice compared to Load.. But, now it is time for Metallica to stop  this failed experiment and return to METAL. Even I can say that they arent  doing metal on this album..this album defies all Metal as we know it. But  yet it still is metal, i cant explain it.. Plus, Reload, in it's self, is  still not metal.
0140282033|1.0|I found the characters and especially the setting in this book just did not ring true.  As a resisdent of a small French village in the Luberon, I think Harris's book seems far more English than French.  My advice to her  would be to stick to writing what she knows...England!
0780627024|5.0|This movie covers alot of issues, but still leaves you with the feeling that you have gotten to know the characters.Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon are fantastic, but the Mom character steals the show.She is  innocence incarnate that blooms with knowledge to become a truly self  discovered and self confident woman.This is story,as I said, that covers  many issues, but I feel the most important one it brings up is self  awareness and belief in something...not just blind faith that this is the  way things should be because they always have been that way, but that  things are this way because they should be or they should be changed.I  laughed out loud and cried too.When a movie can reach inside of you and  make you feel, you know it is a good movie.When a movie makes you think  even after the credits have rolled, then you know it is a great  movie.Pleasantville is both.A must see in my book.
0783241569|5.0|There is so many videos around which cry out &quot;Hillarios! Two thumbs up!&quot; - you believe it, you watch it, and you end up severely disappointed. Lets face it - most new movies are dull and boring, and the  plot is predictable from the very beginning. This one is different. It does  not promise much on the box, but delievers an evening of enjoyment. A  combination of Hollywood-style film making with a british cast of actors  resulted in a love story with excellent (much wittier than you would  usually get from a standard Hollywood-made &quot;comedy&quot;) humor.  Honestly speaking, this film was a pleasant surprise for me, and I don't  remember when my family and I laughed that much. It is witty, it is very  well done, it has excellent actors - everything you want from a movie to  relax after a busy day.

B000002AE3|5.0|The muscianship on this one is outstanding. Great percussion and Lukather's vocals are &quot;on the money&quot;. Great voice for these songs. If you are a Toto fan, don't overlook this one. I almost did. I  often use this CD to test how good a CD system is. The production mix is  excellent!
B000009DUY|4.0|Saving Private Ryan. Written in July 1998, Saving Private Ryan is known as one of more peaceful scores of John Williams. Much different then much of the music that John Williams has written, this score depicts the beaches of  Omaha well. The main score of the soundtrack, &quot;Hymn to the  Fallen&quot;, is a piece that starts with quiet drums of war in the  background, before the Tanglewood choir joins the music, making it a track  that makes you want to think back at the beaches at Normandy, and all the  fallen men. (I won't blame you if you cry while listening to this one!)  Very little of the music on Saving Private Ryan is tense. Most of the other  tracks have the main theme mixed into them. You wouldn't think that a war  movie such as Saving Private Ryan would have a peaceful soundtrack, while  most World War II movies have very tense soundtracks. This score is  probably what brings the movie out so well, since it is not your average  World War II score. If you enjoy quiet and slow music, (or if you like  soundtracks such as Rudy or Glory) this is just the soundtrack for you.  This score also reminds me of &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; in many ways,  since it is also based on World War II, and has the same John William's  style. Overall, this is a great soundtrack.
B00000JGEO|5.0|TRUE LIES, along with PREDATOR, are the two best Arnold S. films. TRUE LIES has a fine plot, great action, and spectacular special effects, with doses of humor thrown in. A great and fun movie for action fans!
0805062971|5.0|I, like many of my peers, read the book AFTER seeing the movie, and was not at all disappointed. This is a healthy dose of reality for all American men, and has really put me in a healthy mood to get beaten up.
0425074811|1.0|Unfortuantely, this was probably one of the first &quot;UFO-related&quot; books I read so I got off on a bad start on the subject material.  Actually, since it was so ridiculous, I only was only able to read about  the first half.  If you have any scientific inclination or backgroud at  all, this book is not for you.  The writing constructs a house of cards by  taking a few facts, building a few wild presumptions based on them, then  making this all fact for the next chapter on which to build more  conclusions.  If there is anything here to be catorgized at all as  &quot;research&quot;, its a stretch.  In the historical research vein,  you're better off with the authors Zecharia Sitchin and Graham Hancock.
B00004STPT|5.0|I am not a big fan of Hans Zimmer, I know that HIS music is very good, but he works very hard for this score;Gladiator... The mystic voice by Lisa Gerrard add a touch of magical in this music. It's ceternely the best score  for Hans Zimmer's career.  Ttrack 4(Earth), 16 and 17 are the Highlight of  this album... One of the best score in this year !
0345403959|4.0|I just started reading science fiction of this sort and I was thrilled with this book.  I was eager to continue reading about this strange new world.
B000002J1S|5.0|I got into this album in the mid 80's when Peter Gabriel was doing &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and Genesis (by this point a trio) was doing catchy little pop tunes. I was amazed by what I heard. The writing is so  strong and some of the melodies will absolutley haunt you (in a good  way)forever. I still find myself having to listen to it from beginning to  end at least 2 or 3 times a year and when I first  bought it in the mid  eighties I listened to it every day for about 3 months. A truly great great  album from one of Prog rocks best bands GENESIS!  Their Pre-Lamb stuff  is also a must!
0767802659|4.0|I own this on vhs format for 1 year I seen it alot of time,now I got a DVD player &amp; a Dolby Digital-DTS receiver,then I plan to buy this movie on DVD then I did buy it!so I put this on my player,I was surprise of the  sharp picture quality and the full 5.1 surround sound.This is better then  the clunky VHS I own,so the Starship Troopers was a great sci-fi war  movie,killing all the bugs and lot of action and humour.I know this movie  got lots of bad review back of 1997,but for me and everyone that like this  movie go out and buy this on DVD.
B000002HRE|5.0|I wouldn't compare it to a masterpiece like &quot;Metallica&quot; (black album), but this album is one of my favorites. ReLoad has that certain sound that you don't find in many records today. From &quot;Fuel&quot; to the eerie &quot;The Memory Remains&quot; to the extraordinary &quot;Devil's  Dance&quot; this CD deserves more credit than what is has been given. I f  you like this CD I recommend Metallica's &quot;S &amp; M&quot; and  Megadeth's &quot;Cryptic Writings&quot;. Buy!
6303022901|5.0|This film is a must-see in how films should be made.  You can not see this film and not become emotionally involved with the characters.  Only someone with a heart of stone will walk away without at least a lump in their  throat. Some drop-dead funny scenes and some tragic scenes that will never  leave your mind.<br />Relationships that make you stop and think about the  people in your own life, especially your family... their motives, desires,  true feelings, etc.<br />A fabulous and emotionally rich film.  Not a  &quot;chick flick&quot; but a stirring thinking person's film.  The  scenery, costumes, etc. are also stellar. This is an incredible piece of  film making.<br />If anyone knows how I can get a copy of this on DVD, please  let me know!
B00003CWL5|5.0|I went into this movie not sure of what to expect.  I had seen the posters (you know, the ones that say &quot;look closer&quot;) and heard the buzz surrounding this film, so I went to see it with an open mind.  And that is  how I came to &quot;look closer&quot; at the beautiful film that is  American Beauty.  From the images of the pristine suburban backdrop in  which the characters attempt to live their lives, to the image of a lone  plastic bag dancing in the wind, I saw beauty in a way I'd never seen it  before.  I let all the glorious, and at times, troubling, images seduce me  and lead me into a world that cast me under its spell.  I've never walked  away from a film so utterly immersed in my own perceptions of what I had  seen until I left the theater after the first time I viewed this  extraordinary masterpiece of the modern-day human condition.  I was so  mesmerized, in fact, that I went back two more times, just to lose myself  in the world of the Burnhams and the people that affect their lives so  profoundly.  The strangest thing about this film, and the reason it is so  wonderful, is that you lose yourself in a world that could very well be the  world in which you live.  So don't just &quot;watch&quot; American Beauty;  EXPERIENCE it.
1558908455|1.0|I was so discouraged when I saw how poorly this film was made.  The special effects were sad and the acting was really bad! The sequel to this movie is even worse!   Don't bother seeing it unless you want to have a  good laugh!
B000002O4X|5.0|This cd is great...but I was a little surprised to  find that the song I love the most, the one played at the New Year's Eve Party in the movie, was not on this cd.  Does anyone know the name of that song and where I can get  a cd including that song?
B00000J7J4|4.0|Artist: Santana Album: Supernatural Producer: BMG/Arista Genre: Rock Category: Rock/Pop<br /> With the hypnotic guitar playing and rhythm, the 70's guitar wizard Carlos Santana has come back strong from years of utter  silence. For everybody in their mid-thirties, the name Carlos Santana  should easily click in your memory. He is now back and as hot as ever. With  songs like \\"Black-magic Women\\" and \\"Oye Como Va\\" to his credentials, the  name Carlos Santana was able to attract names such as Eric Clapton, Rob  Thomas of Matchbox 20, ex-Fugies Wyclef Jean and Lauren Hill, and Dave  Matthews to join in and produce his latest album \\"Supernatural\\". <br />  Santana's new album \\"Supernatural\\", is a mix of South American beats,  honey-sweet guitar licks and solos, and poetic lyrics that blends in  harmoniously. It felt as though Carlos expressed all of his emotions into  this one album, so the mood is constantly and continually changing.<br />  The song that officially marked Santana's return to the limelight was  \\"Smooth\\" featuring Rob Thomas. This catchy tune consists of a supporting  cast of drums and brass, the distinct guitar licks of Carlos, and the deep,  scratchy voice of Thomas. Another song that help launch his album depute is  \\"Maria Maria\\" with special appearances by Everlast and Wyclef Jean. Even  though the lyrics are a bit repetitive, the combination of Everlast's silky  voice and hip-hop rhythm is strangely hypnotic and quickly became a FM hit.  But the song that defines \\"Supernatural\\" most is \\"Love of My Life\\"  featuring Dave Matthews of the Dave Matthews' Band. From a production  standpoint, the song is beautifully composed with every aspect fitting in  flawlessly. From an emotional standpoint, this carol just somehow is able  to reach into your heart, and the lyrics can be related to real life.<br />  Overall, this album is one of Santana's best albums. This is supported by  Santana's sweep of the Grammy's Music Awards including the award for Best  Album.Even though some of the tracks in \\"Supernatural\\" weren't his \\"best\\"  work, the excellent ones easily eclipsed them.  It is clear that he  succeeded in creating sweet rhythmic music for people of every age.
0671042858|5.0|One of Stephen King's best works!  Growing up in the woods of New England, I could put myself in Trisha's place.  Stephen King made the hair on the back of my neck stand up on more than one occasion.  This is a must  read!
6305807086|2.0|I know I'm in the minority here, but I think this film borrows heavily from the film &quot;All Of Me&quot;  Remember that one?  Steve Martin &amp; Lilly Tomlin...She 'enters' his body and takes over.  Anyway, the best  thing about BJM was the puppeteer link, which had it's Spinal Tap  moments...Otherwise, I'd rather watch John in a bad guy/humourous role such  as Cyrus The Virus in &quot;Con Air&quot;
0887306128|5.0|Peter Drucker begins this book by pointing out that there is no science of how to improve executive effectiveness, nor any naturally-occurring effective executives.  The redeeming point of this problem is that he  argues that executive effectiveness can be learned.<br />The principles begin  with a focus on time management.  We can get greater quantities of every  other resource we need, except time.  Drucker reports that executives spend  their time much differently than they think they do and much differently  than they would like to.  His solution is to begin by measuring how you  spend your time, and compare it with an ideal allocation.  Than begin to  systematically get rid of the unimportant in favor of the important.  His  suggestions include stopping some things, delegation, creating policy  decisions to replace ad hoc decisions, staying out of things that others  should do, and so forth.  Any student of time management will recognize the  list he suggests.  One of the best points is to give yourself large blocks  of uninterrupted time to do more significant tasks.  He also cautions us  not to cut down on time spent with other people.  If an hour is required,  don't try to do it in 15 minutes.  <br />Next, Drucker argues that we should  focus on what will make a difference rather than unimportant questions.   Otherwise, we will fill our time with motion rather than proceeding towards  results.  <br />Beyond that, he points out that we have to build on our own  strengths and those of the people in our organization.  That is how we can  outperform the competition and accomplish much more.<br />We also need to be  systems thinkers, getting to the core of the issue first.  If we are weak  on new products, we need to work on the new product development process  before fine-tuning our marketing.  If we reverse the order of these  activities, our results will be far less.<br />Perhaps the best section in the  book has to do with executive decision-making, when to make a decision,  about what, and what principles to apply.  If you only read this section,  you would be well rewarded for studying this fine book.<br />I especially  liked the familiar Drucker use of important historical examples to make his  points.  You'll remember the principles better because the examples are so  vivid.  <br />Although this book was written some time ago, it retains the  strength of its insight today.  Truly , this is a timeless way to achieve  greater effectiveness.  <br />You may be concerned about how you are going to  learn to apply these concepts.  That is actually quite easy.  Drucker  provides questions in each section that will guide you, step-by-step, to  focus your attention on the most promising areas.  <br />If you only read one  book about how to improve your personal effectiveness as an executive, you  will find this to be a rewarding choice.
0684800713|4.0|These characters' personas must have been exactly what Gertrude Stein had in mind when she coined the term &quot;Lost Generation.&quot;  Especially Lady Brett Ashley fits this mold of a woman who has lost her idealism and  has saught refuge in a pretend world of alcohol-inspred giggles.  The  details of European life coupled with the fascinating character  interactions--of narrator Jake Barnes, Lady Brett Ashley, ex-boxer and Jew  Robert Cohn, and Brett's fiance Mike--make for an exceptional novel

Great effects, beautiful wardrobe,  but pleeease: How many times can you see that ship sink. I believe that  once is more than enough; maybe in ten years we could see it again on T.V.  Meanwhile, you should buy &quot;Casablanca&quot;, a movie worth seeing a  thousand times
0451191153|5.0|If you don't know who Ayn Rand is, read this book.  It was a life changing experience for me.  Trust me, READ THIS BOOK!  You won't regret it!
0440219078|4.0|This book is pretty good, but not one of Lowry's best. It's about Jonas, a boy who lived in a futuristic community and was becoming an adult member of it. As an apprentice to the Receiver of memories, he learned about the  individuality, color, and variety of the past. That's when the boy and old  man knew that things needed to be changed. It was cool to learn about  another world, how Jonas received memories of sunshine and snow. It was  sweet how he cared so much for the baby Gabe that his Nurturer father  brought home. A blessing and a curse is that the book is so easy to  understand. Like some sci-fi novels, it doesn't confuse, but it could have   more depth. Why doesn't Jonas reflect more on his new discoveries and  feelings? Maybe he and the Giver(as he calls his mentor)could've done more  to open the community's eyes, but their decision was a start. The book does  serve as a caveat about what any society in the world could mutate into.  This is a young adult book, so you wouldn't expect it to compare to Isaac  Asimov. At least the story does have a happy ending. It would be  interesting if there could be a series about young Jonas' adventures and  what happens to him in the future, but speculating is also fun. Definitely  read some of Lois Lowry's other works like &quot;A Summer to Die&quot;, but  this one is worth checking out too.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I've never been a hardcore Pearl Jam fan like many out there. To me, they've put out too many albums following the same formula: Three really catchy songs between nine or ten really awful songs. Who could forget  &quot;Bugs?&quot; On this album though, Pearl Jam seem to have gotten their  whole groove together. Too often it seemed like Vedder versus the band.  You'll notice here most of the thirteen songs hum with cohesiveness. There  are no standout anthems here. There are though very hard rocking songs that  proclaim their heritage and pride in following the paths of the likes of  Neil Young, or dare I say, Black Sabbath as well as an equally loud voice  yelling their way through the clutter to a new musical direction. Though  strangely nostalgic, the melodies sound perfectly new and unblemished by  time. Like I said, I'm not a PJ fan, save for a few sporadic songs on  various albums, however on this one, I can say I am a true devoted fan.  Amidst all the electronic brewhaha that's going on currently, PJ is one  band that will never give up the guitar. Thank goodness and amen.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This is truly a new low point in the history of music making. I am pleading with you not to let the marketers win. Britney is talentless, but she makes a fine looking puppet who says all the right things.  Unfortunately, these days that equals huge success. All I know is that  music works in cycles and I guarantee that in a few short years there will  be plenty of embarrassed owners of this CD...let's just hope it's not TOO  many.
B00004SCX6|5.0|this cd is 1000% britney although she changed her style into a more funky one. my favourite songs are &quot;stronger&quot; and &quot;oops...&quot; but i also love the slow &quot;dear diary&quot;. not to forget the rolling  stones cover &quot;satisfaction&quot;, sounds much better than the  original! buy! buy! buy!
B000005S31|5.0|Coney Island Baby is an incredible album. It even can be compared to some of the Velvet's albums. In my opinion, it beats out Transformer as his most accesible album. Personally, I don't care if Lou's albums are commercially  accesible or not. This album, however, is just a great album. Crazy Feeling  starts off the album great. It lets you know that this going to be one of  his happier albums. Charley's Girl is another great song. The version of  She's My Best Friend is just as good as the original version that the  Velvets did. Kicks is possibly the best song on the album. It is an edgy,  fast paced song in the tradition of Heroin. A Gift, Ooohhh Baby and  Nobody's Business are all great songs. Coney Island Babey is an incredible  song. It is one of Reed's best ballads since Pale Blue Eyes. This album is  really great. It is a great starting place for those who want to give Lou a  try, which I highly reccomend doing.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Binaural, the sixth studio album from Pearl Jam is another great effort from Pearl Jam.  There is more varied song writing in this with Stone writing Thin Air, Of the Girl, and Rival, while Jeff writes God's Dice and  Nothing as it Seems.  Out of the these five Of the Girl and Nothing as it  Seems are brilliant songs, the other three are good, but could fade with  repeated listenings.  On the other hand, Evacuation, Light Years,  Insignificance, and Grievance are all brilliant songs.  All lyrics to these  songs are penned by  Eddie, and it seems to me he's been reading a lot of  Kurt Vonnegut.  He makes points about depression, spirituality, big  brother, and the lack of love in the world.  Matt sounds great on drums, in  particular in Rival and Sleight of Hand, which is one of the Pearl Jam  songs I've heard in a while, wonderful instrumenation.  Soon Forget is fun  little ukele tune that Eddie does alone, and it's kind of a &quot;can't  take it with you&quot; anthem.  He sings very folky on it.  You can hear a  Neil Young influence on this album more than any other, which is a good  direction for the future of this band.  They're not concentrating on saving  rock n' roll, they're not employing silly uses of technology in order to  make a different album.  They're just crafting songs, and making albums  saying what they want to say.  It keeps me happy.  While it's not a perfect  album, it's an extremely good one and a must for any fan.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Well first of all this album is definately for only the diehard fans like myself, those of you who are still clinging to the Pearl Jam from the &quot;Ten&quot; album will more than likely not enjoy this one. It starts  out with a couple rather subpar songs but becomes much more listenable in  the middle, for instance the song &quot;light years&quot; is by far the hit  of the album, it very catchy and the most melodically charming of any of  the tracks. The album also ends on a high note the song &quot;Soon  Forget&quot; is not forgettable to say the least, it has instantly become  one of my favorite tracks to date the lyrics and ukalele that Eddie plays  are a side of him that we'll probably never see again, those of you who  liked &quot;Last Kiss&quot; will most definately enjoy this one. In  closing, those of you who appreciated NO CODE &amp; YIELD should enjoy this  album, those of you who are looking for a rivival of the TEN grungy side  I'd like to recommend CREED's new album and maybe we'll see you the next  time around.

1558216847|5.0|A friends mother read this to her kids (when I was about twelve), and I was lucky enough to hear a few chapters. Some years later I read it again, and now I'm thinking I'll get and read it yet again. What a great story! I  noticed some reviews were cynical, some saying the story was farfetched  and/or boring.I rate it easily in the top ten of all the books I've ever  read! Truely amazing!
0385484518|1.0|The Lesson: P.T. Barnum said it a century ago &quot;There's A Fool Born Every Minute&quot;. This lesson is also the answer to one of Life's Greatest Questions: Why is this silly book such a huge bestseller? The Answer: It is cheap,it is short and it is written on a third grade level.  It therefore involves very little committment of time, money or thought. It  allows the average moron to proudly state to others that he just got done  reading a N.Y. Times Bestseller. Of course it [is inexpensive] and took 2  hours to read but what the hell. Also this same person will &quot;love this  wonderful book&quot; because they have very little else in their literary  experience to compare it to.
0312853238|4.0|Like others, I sought out 'Ender's Game' due to the fact that it won the Hugo and Nebula Awards.  Apparently like some others, I too was a bit disappointed that the book didn't fully live up to all my expectations.   Certainly it was an interesting page turner, but problems remain.<br />I found  the lack of description a bit hampering, almost as if the book is written  for a 5th grade level, ie. he did this, she did that, etc...<br />I did  sympathize with Ender however, and his saga was consistently entertaining  if not enthralling.  For better and more in depth sci-fi, I'd suggest  seeking out Stephenson, Dan Simmons, and William Gibson to name a few.  Of  course I just picked up 'Speaker', so obviously there is something going  here...
B00000J7J4|3.0|As a boomer, I love Santana, his magic fingers,  and the Latin beat, but some of the songs on this CD are too modern-day pop for me. I feel modern-day pop has taken a pit fall since the 80's, only getting worse, and  has become very disposable, unlistenable, forgetable music.  The whole idea  of such a recording seems like a well contrived plan to reach young people  who determine where what stands on the charts through sales.  I can do  without the rap bit, &quot;Smooth&quot; of course, is a winner, and will  get anyone on the dance floor.  Wish there were more instrumentals.  I had  only heard bits of this album that I really liked before buying it, but was  sadly disappointed.  If you love Santana, but don't like today's pop, it's  not for you.  As a pop album, I guess it's one of the better ones, but  cannot remotely compare to Santana's early works, which were much more  fluid and free.
B00000DR5I|4.0|In 1975 TD continued their 'cosmic adventures beyond the ultraworld' with this 35-minute album. Although the music of &quot;Rubycon&quot; is experimental and not easy to swallow, it is one of TD's most successful  efforts, both commercially (UK charts #12) and artistically. An elaboration  of the sequencer/synthesiser technology explored on their early masterpiece  &quot;Phaedra&quot;, &quot;Rubycon&quot; adds a slightly threatening,  uncanny flavor to the lofty, open-ended compositions. It's the soundtrack  for swimming and diving in a cold, clear lake, but with dark clouds ahead.  The two tracks take a similar path, featuring occasional (under)water  noises, low frequency sequencers, high-flying synth sounds, and choral  effects, building an utterly hypnotic music which can be immensely powerful  and fascinating. &quot;Rubycon&quot; is the highlight of TD's most  influential era, and a must-have for every serious fan of electronic music.  Even so, it's hard work for the uninitiated and for fans of TD's  lightweight, melodic latter-day work. Also to consider: &quot;Firmament  II&quot; by Main, an album which transfers the aesthetics of '70s ambient  music into '90s post-rock.
B00004SCX6|1.0|WHY?  WHY DID HER SONGWRITERS HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN AND PROVIDE HER WITH THE SAME SONGS TO SING AS WERE ON HER DEBUT? Ms. Spears has once again released an album of songs that all come in two flavors: brainless, recycled  techno/dance tracks and fluffy, inane ballads. Nothing here is even mildly  listenable, nor intelligent in any respect, nor even musically interesting  to listen to. The least the writers could have done was be a little  creative inside the two cookie-cutter boundaries. As I had feared and  anticipated, she did indeed do the same thing over again.
B000002IWQ|4.0|After the glassy, relatively pop-oriented sound of &quot;Roll the bones&quot;, &quot;Counterparts&quot; is a welcome return to more provocative lyrics and a harder rock edge. Obviously, this album was  inspired by early-'90s grunge rockers like Soundgarden and Pearl Jam. It's  the closest Rush have ever come to alternative rock music -- with  straightforward rhythms, loud guitar riffs, powerful melodies, and tight  arrangements. Alex Lifeson is a prominent figure on most of the tracks,  however, his riffs sometimes sound overblown and forced (&quot;Stick it  out&quot;). Also, Peart's 'sex &amp; death'-lyrics are quite a step from  previous albums, and his stripped-down drumming is one of the most  memorable aspects of &quot;Counterparts&quot;. Geddy Lee turns in  workmanlike, unobtrusive bass performances, but his I think his vocal  delivery is often listless and cool. Standout tracks are &quot;Cut  to..&quot;, &quot;Cold fire&quot;, the moody &quot;Between sun..&quot;, and  &quot;The speed..&quot; with some atmospheric, floating guitar lines.  Equally, there's not a bad song on this disc, and it's one of Rush's most  focused and consistent efforts. A rather untypical album in Rush's  discography -- it almost could be a live performance in the studio -- but  the results are, as to be expected, very satisfying.
B00004KD1A|5.0|I've waited years for this to become available on CD. This is one of the greatest live rock albums of all time. I'm not kidding. Every track is a winner with Gallagher and his rhythm section of McKenna and McAvoy  absolutely burning a hole in any CD player! This is rock and roll blues  energy that should come with a radioactive sticker. Anybody who never saw  the late Rory G live missed something very special. He had that rare  combination of chops, soul and energy laced with more than his share of  Irish charm and twinkle that made him a popular music treasure for all  time. I strongly urge you to buy this album, d'you hear me!
6302800420|5.0|Tootsie is nothing short of amazing. Dustin Hoffman gives on of his funniest and greatest performances ever. A New York actor needs money. But no one in the acting buisness will work with him. So Michael Dorsey(Dustin  Hoffman) disguises himself as a woman and gets highered in America's #1  soap opera. This film is funny and sometimes dramatic. An excellent romp.  Everybody will love it!
0880381736|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight is the beginning of a phenomenal story of the classic fight of good versus evil.  Each character is unique and interesting and the grave seriousness of the book is perfectly balanced by  the innocense of Tas, the hearty grumblings of Flint of course then there  is Fizban...but he is something all his own.  As the group struggles  through each adventure you learn to love and hate each one, and before you  know it you are done and dying to pick up the next book in the series.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Compared to their first album, they have really matured. Fred Durst has gotten a better voice and his band have gotten a better sound. However, this isn't a album that everyone is going to like. For example, you have to  realize that Limp Bizkit says the &quot;F&quot; word a lot on Significant  Other. Some people might think that a few cuss words are okay, but LB says  a lot more than a few cuss words. It defiantly won't make a lot of grown  ups happy. I suggest this album to teenagers only. If your 11 or under, you  shouldn't be listening to this kind of stuff. If you do however, you could  get the cd the &quot;bleeps&quot; out the cuss words. I hope this request  helps all the people who don't know if they should get it or not.
630518299X|5.0|In my life I've definitely seen thousands of movies.  The Truman show ranks in the top 25 best that I've ever seen.  When I first saw the Truman show on opening day I didn't know what to expect.  I came out not knowing  if really enjoyed it.  As the days went on I kept thinking about it and it  grew on me.  I've now seen this movie over 5 times and it gets better with  every viewing.  Beautifully acted and filmed it is one of the best movies  I've ever seen.  Jim Carrey should have recieved an oscar nomination for  his performance and Ed Harris should have won, along with Peter Weir.  Only  once in a while a movie of this caliber comes along.  Even if you are  skeptical I think you should give it a shot.  You may love it you may hate  it but hey everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
6302732875|5.0|This is a resonating film.  It is not spectacular in the ordinary sense, nor sweeping, nor bright.  In many ways the film exists as a testament to the enduring power of Logos, both spoken and written. Mamet brings a  dazzling script, and the actors bring their &quot;A&quot; games: there is  nothing else you need.<br />Mamet has written a story about what one character  calls 'a world of Men,' and indeed, there are no female characters.  There  is also no release and no safety in this movie; the characters are all  desperate, clawing for the tiniest bit of success that means they can eat  for one more day.  They're salesmen, and we see their methods; as always,  Mamet is interested in the art of the Con and the art of survival.<br />The  cast is amazing.  Pacino is mesmerizing, in a role where his affectations  are appropriate to the character he plays. Lemmon is simultaneously  pitiable and despicable, a delicate balance that is maintained  throughout.<br />I have said that the movie resonates.  I've never been a  salesman of the type presented here, but I think of them often because of  this film.  On the surface, capitalism means endless equal opportunity for  everyone.  However, since we cannot legislate talent, the reality is that  most of life is a mad squabble for meaningless stakes. Better than any film  in recent memory, _Glengarry Glen Ross_ captures that fact.
0780625129|5.0|American History X is a MUST see.  This film is very graphic, griping, and will open your eyes to some of the causes of hate that is flourishing in this world.  After viewing this film, you cannot help but think about it .  . .  constantly . . . for days afterwards.  It is THAT powerful.  Edward  Norton gives a stellar performance and you can FEEL his rage, his hate. You  actually feel the skinhead that he has become.  His time in jail allows him  to transform his hate into compassion and love and it is ironic how this is  actually accomplished.  In fact, all of the actors were excellent in that  you could \\"feel\\" what they were going through as well.  The casting was  excellent.<br />I would love to see this film as a mandatory requirement for  all students in this country - I believe it would have the powerful effect  of reversing someone's hate and/or prejudices.
B00004T8RK|5.0|While 'No Code' and 'Yield' were a little weak by Pearl Jam standards, 'Binaural' is one of those albums that is just too good to be ignored.  The great thing about this record is that the focus is not on the Vedder vocal  performance, but on the band as a whole, with everyone turning in the best  performance of their career.  Definitely a must-buy album this summer.
B000001E7V|5.0|You will be stunned the first time you listen to this album. Right off the bat, the first track, \\"Overcome,\\" explodes in your face with an hypnotic pulse pounding beat with a unique mixture of horn and flute. If you listen carefully there is even breathing in the background in between beats. I've never heard anything like it before and I was immediately hooked the first time i heard it. Martina's sexy soulful voice makes the song sound even more sensual and mysterious. I just knew that i was in for a trip and was experiencing something new. I listened to the whole album and felt like i was transported to an alternate reality. Listening to this album is like experiencing a movie. You lose yourself in the dream and lose sight of what's real and what's not. After listening to this album over and over again i was hooked to the point where i stopped listening to the music i used to listen to and started collecting all of Tricky's albums and other trip hop cd's that sounded like Tricky's music. Thanks to Tricky I got introduced to Portishead, Massive Attack, Bjork and Pj Harvey. Of all my cd's, Maxinquaye and Portishead's \\"Dummy\\" album are my favorites. Tricky's Pre-Millenium Tension and Nearly God are amazing as well. Maxinquaye is so special because the songs are all so different but flow well together creating that melancholic feel to it very much like the albums by Portishead. The songs that stand out are Overcome, Black Steel, Hell is Around the Corner, Pumpkin and Aftermath. My own personal favorites include Abbaon Fat Track which has a really phat baseline to it with lyrics of humor and satire about sex, and Black Steel because it's a punk song with sampled lyrics from a Public Enemy song talking trash about the government. And of course, Overcome. Overcome(Karmakoma) alone is worth the price of the whole cd. Its the trippiest song i've ever heard in my life. You can also find this song on the \\"strange days\\" soundtrack and the original lyrical version on the Massive Attack \\"Protection\\" album. Overall, Tricky has given new life to music and has gone where no artist has gone before. Setting a new genre and making music revolutionary again.<BR>Thanks to Martina for her beautiful voice in this which made it all possible.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Just like . . .Baby One More Time Britney has made another great CD. It is much different then . . .Baby One More Time a lot though, most of the songs are dance. This CD can never get boring. It is very unique. No other artist  has really every mixed dance, some rap, and a little rock on a CD, except  for some. Britney has definintly scored again with a one in a lifetime  album for the people of 2000. If you compare this CD to Christina  Aguilara's CD, or  Toni Braxton she will always win, big time. If you are a  mellow perosn and only love slow, soft rock music, you might even hate this  CD. You HAVE to like dance or maybe even rap to like this CD. &quot;Oops! I  Did It Again&quot; will surly hit number #1 on the charts. You have to by  this CD, if you don't your missing somthing very good!
0920236162|4.0|What a cute story!  Nothing daunts the Princess or stops her as she deals with the dragon's destruction of her life (and her clothes!).  She marches on, outwitting the dragon and proving herself a worthy opponent.  The ending is great.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I only recently bought this album but have been listening to it for years and its a classic must have in any CD collection.  Ian Anderson's vocals and superior flute playing make Jethro Tull one of the most unique and  innovative groups ever.  Songs like Aqualung, Locomotive Breathe, and the  little known Songs for Jeffrey(which JT played in the Rolling Stones Rock  'n' Roll Circus) make this album a classic
B00004SCX6|3.0|Its safe to say that Britney will achieve chart success in the top40 radio etc. It isn't very hard to see why. The materail is made for top 40. And  her voice has had a slight improvement over the year. This time however,  there aren't so many listless ballads and more of the dance tunes aka  &quot;Baby, One More Time&quot; and &quot;Crazy(Stop Remix)&quot;. Which  isn't surprising considering that these were the mos successful singles in  US and hell, why waste a good formula. Which is a pity because on 1 or 2  songs such as the ballad &quot;Dear Diary&quot; which she wrote herself  (horrror, horror! Britney can WRITE songs? ) she shines with sincerity and  the child in herself which she loves to talk about is felt here and the  sincerity of this song lingers after this album. The other songs aren't  half bad, even the cover of &quot;I Can't Get No Satisfaction&quot; isn't  such a turn off. If only Britney and her producers could peel away the  layer of overpolished pop from the album of &quot;Come-hithers&quot;. Then  she wouldn't have to pretend to be a &quot;Sex-bomb&quot;. She can just be  herself the 'girl-next-door' as she always says she is. Then she wouldn't  have to depend on the material as many artistes do. For once, just be  yourself, Britney.
B000001FDQ|1.0|More like a nasty sounding jumble of junk puked on a guitar.  Any mention of Bach and Ingwie in the same sentence is an insult to a great classical  composer.  Even though Ingwie is fast with his fingers he shouldn't even be  mentioned when it comes to composition.  Ingwie is overated and his music  doesn't say anything.
B000003TAR|5.0|...The pleasures of Nirvana is reached again with In Utero.<br />Nirvana's classic grudge, dark, bitter act is re-revealed with his awesome album.<br />Starts with the whiny, somewhat slow, but great 'Serve The  Servants,' before moving into the abrasive and harsh 'Scentless Apprentice'   The next to were huge commerial hits and is considered with 'All  Apologies' the main singles of this album:  'Heart Shaped Box' and 'Rape  me'.  <br />The rest of the album is, as usual in Nirvana style, well-rounded  and filled with quality tracks like 'Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge  On Seattle' and the like.<br />Overall, highly recommended.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I just got this CD.  I think it is better than her  1st one and I loved it.  My personal favorites are Oops, Lucky, Satisfaction, Don't Let Me BE The  First.  They are really all good.  You ought to go get it, especially  if you are a Britney fan.
B000003TA4|5.0|...Nevermind is a paramount of Nirvana and music history.  It single-handedly brought the Seattle grundge scene into the limelight, good or bad, and gave bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, etc a chance to get  some mainstream air time.  <br />Nevermind is raging non-stop from beginning  to end, starting off with a bomb of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' and 'In  Bloom' before slowing down to a soft 'Come as You are'  Right after it  picks it up with the high energy of 'Breed' and 'Lithium,' the screaming  bitter 'Territorial Pissing,' and the melodic and some of my favorite songs  ever 'Drain you' and 'Lounge Act'  Before ending strong.  <br />Nevermind is  by far one of my favorite albums of all time.  Though its music is not  extremely complicated, Cobain's vocals and Grohl's drumming makes this  album a must have.  If you want start getting into Nirvana, which i find  extremely weird because you should have done that like 6 years ago, start  here.  Then move on to some of their other stuff like In Uterol....
B000002UYZ|5.0|The Beatles are my favorite band because they have such great voices with great lyrics, and  great music. I wasn't alive when the Beatles were big, but still I like the Beatles more than any other singing group or solo.  &quot;She Loves You&quot; Is my favorite of both CD's. &quot;Help!&quot; is  an awesome song. There's about 15 great songs on this CD set, and for you  their might be more! I think this set is a great buy in terms of great  songs.
B000003N7K|5.0|Coltrane is almost unrecognizable here. I first heard these tunes on &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;, and was so marveled that I had to hire the video to read the credits (compliment to Mr. Eastwood's taste).  It is funny to read nowadays what some critics said about Coltrane then:  '...angry tenor...'. This is a treatise on the relaxed intellectual ballad.  Probably the only time Desmond and Coltrane shared some views.  Listen to  &quot;Lush Life&quot; and you will think of whatever became of Johnny  Hartman.
B00004T8RK|1.0|Once and for all, Pearl Jam has proven that they have lost the edge and anger that made them a phenomenon in the alternative music world in the early 90's?  It seems as if they haven't been able to put together a solid  album since Vitalogy (even that was less than spectacular) and this new  album is further proof of their slide.  Binaural is 13 songs that are  nothing more than variations of the lollipop hit &quot;Last Kiss&quot;.   Where are Eddie's electric vocals that were a beacon for listeners on  tracks such as &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Jeremy&quot; and  &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;.  Some may say this is the evolution of a band,  but I say no, this is the unraveling of what was once the best band on the  scene. If I could give this CD less than 1 star, I would....
B00004SCX6|4.0|This c.d. is defiently pop. It has some mixture and I think that you might like it. It is probably better than her old c.d. If your a Brittney Spears fan I would defiently buy this one!    <br />...Got sent from above...
B00000IAU3|5.0|I'm always very fascinated about how they captured the movements of the Roswells casts members while the song (Here with Me) was playing.The introduction only makes me day dream.A very BIG credit to DIDO (A very  PROMISING singer to be &quot;praise&quot;)I applaud you. I don't have the  cd yet, but because of your reviews guys it make me wanna get one.Thanks  for the insights. Probably I will never regret this. Just one song I like  to hear.(Here with Me).I love ROSWELL show,I love the cast members.Thanks  Jason Behr,Shiri Appleby,Brendan Fehr,Majandra Delfino,Collin Hanks(son of  Tom Hanks)and the other blond girl(forgot her name)But anyway more power to  the show.
6305807086|4.0|For sheer originality, it's hard to beat \\"Being John Malkovich\\" as the most outrageously entertaining comedy of 1999.  The central gimmick of Charlie Kaufmann's original screenplay is now widely known--a low-spirited  puppeteer (John Cusack) discovers a portal leading into the brain of the  actor John Malkovich (played by none other than Malkovich himself).  It may  sound unworkable on paper, but the approach to the storytelling is unique  and offbeat enough to overcome the most obvious hurdles.<br />Director Spike  Jonze proves himself a true cinematic visionary.  Rather than highlighting  his story with bright, vivid colors, Jonze adopts a restrained, subtle  visual style that that perfectly suits the film's sly, warped identity.   \\"Malkovich\\" is not an in-your-face comedy, and Jonze's wise choice of  murky, underlit camera angles make it clear that all attention belongs on  the actors, and on Kaufmann's script.<br />Jonze is just as adept at getting  great performances out of his cast.  Catherine Keener deservedly won an  Oscar nomination for her bitchy Maxine, but Cameron Diaz matches her,  moment for moment, in a much less showy and obvious role.  Cusack is  note-perfect as the squinting puppeteer, and Malkovich, proving himself the  best sport in Hollywood by starring in a film that so unabashedly makes fun  of his image, gives a brilliant, perfectly timed comic performance.<br />From  its odd premise the story builds and builds, tossing in one oddball twist  after<br />another with admirable energy.  \\"Being John Malkovich\\" tweaks its  off-the-wall plot for maximum comic effect; what's surprising is the  effectiveness with which it subtly eases in a few thought-provoking  questions.  Even more surprising is the way \\"Being John Malkovich\\" examines  each of its characters with considerable compassion, when it would be so  easy to treat them with contempt.  Sure, it's nonsense--only a truly  demented farce could find poignancy in a lesbian relationship involvingMalkovich as an unwitting sexual go-between--but the film embraces these  perverse notions with deadpan conviction.<br />Roger Ebert named \\"Being John  Malkovich\\" the best film of 1999.  It wasn't a bad choice, by any  means--the film damn well deserved a Best Picture nomination--but it's hard  to ignore the flaws that emerge in the construction toward the very end.   The film is successful only so long as it avoids attempting to explain its  premise; once \\"Malkovich\\" tries to take itself seriously, it derails faster  than a speeding train.  Kaufmann throws in a lousy subplot involving  geriatrics staging a hostile midnight takeover of Malkovich's brain, as  well as a chase scene through Malkovich's subconscious that, though clever,  borders on the excessive.  The last half hour or so is no less entertaining  than what came before it, but it's also surprisingly out of place in a film  that thrives by being subtle, not by flaunting its inventions.  Ebert  called the movie \\"endlessly inventive,\\" and that's as much a handicap as it  is a compliment.  Here is a movie so drunk on its own cleverness that it  doesn't know when to stop; it takes several risks, most of which pay off,  but it also takes one risk too many.  The result?  Almost the best film of  1999.
B00004STPT|5.0|Now I know why the soundtrack of this movie will be currentlyso hot. I have lots of collection of movie soundtrack. But Iwas   unbelievable surprised by this one when I put it in my CD-player. No wonder  some people complain that the music is too 'outstanding' when they saw the  movie.
B0000029AL|4.0|THE BAND: Steven Tyler (vocals, piano, harmonica), Joe Perry (guitar), Brad Whitford (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums & percussion). Guest saxophone appearance by David Woodford on \\"Mama Kin\\" and \\"Write Me\\". Home town is Boston, MA and Sunapee, NH.<br /><br />THE DISC: (1973) Recorded at Intermedia Sound in Boston, MA. This digitally remastered version released in 1993. 8 songs clocking in at approximately 36 minutes. All songs written by Steven Tyler and Joe Perry except \\"Walkin' The Dog\\" (Rufas Thomas). The disc includes a 4-page foldout with original release liner notes, photos and artwork. No song lyrics. Label - Columbia/Sony.<br /><br />COMMENTS: 1973 was an outstanding year in rock and roll history. Some truly monsterous albums were released by very established bands - Led Zeppelin (Houses Of The Holy), Jethro Tull (Aqualung), Deep Purple (Who Do We Think We Are), Alice Cooper (Billion Dollar Babies), Pink Floyd (Dark Side Of The Moon), The Who (Quadrophenia), and Paul McCartney (Band On The Run). Enter newcomers Aerosmith... a swaggering rock & roll band that was heart-felt and fresh. Great songs and guitar work by such a young and inspired group of young musicians. \\"Aerosmith\\" produced the band's first hit (and a big one it was) \\"Dream On\\". Some wonderful deep album cuts include \\"Somebody\\", \\"Make It\\", and \\"Walkin' The Dog\\". \\"Mama Kin\\" may have been a smaller hit, but it really got noticed after Guns & Roses did a remake of it in the late 1980's. Contains one of my all-time favorite Steven Tyler lines - \\"Talk to yourself and you'll hear what you want to know\\" (\\"Movin Out\\"). Production was a tad flat, but this remastered version is a definite improvement. This is a great band - in a time when they were living gig to gig, scraping for their next meal, playing like they really had something to prove... before the movie appearances (Steven Tyler in \\"Be Cool\\"), Movie Soundtracks (\\"Armageddon\\", \\"Beavis & Butthead\\", etc), numerous sugar coated pop/power ballads (\\"Cryin'\\", \\"Amazing\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"What It Takes\\", etc), or before any of a dozen 'greatest hits' compilations ever existed. This is simply a classic album from one of America's truly great rock & roll bands.Cryin'\\", \\"Amazing\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"What It Takes\\", etc), or before any of a dozen 'greatest hits' compilations ever existed. This is simply a classic album from one of America's truly great rock & roll bands.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural may not produce a hit like &quot;Alive,&quot;  &quot;Daughter,&quot; or &quot;Betterman.&quot;  It will definitely not  please listeners who feel that &quot;Ten&quot; represents the zenith of the  Pearl Jam sound.  Furthermore, no song on the album is alone capable of  winning new listeners, such as the awesome &quot;Given to Fly&quot; from  Pearl Jam's previous album, &quot;Yield.&quot;  Despite these challenges,  Pearl Jam's sixth studio release is truly a collaborative art masterpiece  -- an album reflecting the talent of all five of its members.  From the  moment one peels away the plastic wrapping, he gets the sense that great  care has been taken to provide fans with something special.  The packaging  is stunning, foreshadowing the celestial feel evoked by many of the album's  songs -- Listening to songs like &quot;Light Years,&quot; &quot;Nothing as  it Seems&quot;, and &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; makes you want to jump in  your car, drive to an open expanse, and gaze at the stars from the hood of  your car, Binaural blaring in the background.  This album reminds fans how  much the band is maturing with every release.  I encourage fans to  re-listen to all of their Pearl Jam records to compare them to Binaural.   The careful listener will notice that Binaural exceeds all of the others in  fluidity, subtlety, originality, complexity, and richness -- Binaural is  indeed a fitting title; the album really requires two attentive ears to  appreciate.  Those who are looking for a rock album that raises to the  level of art; that challenges its listeners, instead of just reflecting  back popular sentiments; that demonstrates that some musicians still  believe in the quality of the communication, rather than the quantity of  sales; should purchase this record.
B00000K3D4|4.0|A dreamworld is a place where the mind can let go of its mortal responsibilities, and simply escape and enjoy its new-found freedom.<br />The mythical dreamworld that is created by Jim Henson and his son in the  Labyrinth, is an absolutely timeless piece of work.<br />The way that the  unique muppets each interact with each other and the live actors, (in some  cases the puppets are live actors as well), is fantastic.  The style that  is presented in this movie is one that is not likely to be paralleled in  the near future, the creative genius is Jim Henson was a very unique  talent.<br />The DVD version of this movie also contains a very interesting  extra feature on the Making of the Labyrinth, which has inredibly neat  close-ups on how the puppets were generated and run.
B00001OH82|4.0|Like always, David Bowie can give any music a sexy sound.  Although I don't usually listen to a lot of heavy-metal, this group is a delight to listen to.  There's plenty of hard-driving rhythmn and guitar as well as  strong vocals.  I really enjoyed Heaven's In Here and Pretty Thing as well  as Video Crime.  A nice addition to the Bowie fan and a good listen to any  rocker.
B00003CWPR|5.0|There is a certain nuance which lurks underneath the reels of every Stanley Kubrick film, a revelation about the human condition that is haunting yet ultimately cannot be refuted.  The two faces of humanity - the  &quot;awake face&quot; and the &quot;dream face&quot; - are what surfaces  from the film and into the viewer's mind in Stanley Kubrick's final film.   Yet this film is also a journey of the conscience, a journey along the  lines of James Joyce or Fyodor Dostoyevsky in which the principal character  (in this film's case, Dr. Bill Harford, played with splendid reserve by Tom  Cruise) searches through the bowels of the world towards some truth that is  reached in any number of forms (the last line of the film is surely the  most clear cut example of this kind of revelation).        A plot summary  for this film would be useless.  Eyes Wide Shut is a film that must be  experienced, a film which, like a great work of art, must be savored and  mulled over for a good two or three viewings.  Generally, the story follows  the journey of a jealous doctor who, upon hearing his wife's revelation of  a fantasized affair, descends into the seedy, smokey, sexual underworld of  New York City where he meets a variety of characters, some as aids, others  tempters, all damned in one way or another.      The cinematography in this  film is lush and fluid, melding well with Kubrick's amazing usage of color  and setting.  The streets of New York (all a film set) are unbelievably  realistic, with crumbling shops and sidewalks hinting at the corruption  which lurks underneath the &quot;waking world&quot;.  There should be no  confusion in the title of this film; &quot;Eyes wide shut&quot; seems to  signifiy a walking dream state and this film, though long but not  unbearably long, is exactly that: a dream state through which the viewer  must journey.  And with Stanley Kubrick as the tour guide, the trip is well  worth it.
B00000HZFP|5.0|Brilliant.  Astounding, breathtaking, electrifying, profound on more levels than I may ever discover.  I fell completely in love with &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; from the very first preview night of  its Los Angeles run, and I knew right off that this cast album was a  must-have.<br />This, ladies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not, is THE  definitive rock musical.  No &quot;rock musical&quot; that came before it  even comes close to reaching the true edge and impact that Hedwig does.   Stephen Trask's versatile score displays a broad range of musical  influence, glorying in a sense of pastiche that really makes you think  about the question of self-identity that runs through the show.  It's  amazing how a song like &quot;The Origin of Love,&quot; with its very Dr.  Seussian lyrics, can still pack such an impact; &quot;Wicked Little  Town&quot; is gorgeous; &quot;Midnight Radio&quot; will always bring tears  to my eyes.<br />Michael Cerveris will always be my favorite Hedwig, but John  Cameron Mitchell, the originator, has a beautiful voice and infuses the  character of Hedwig with a delicate, yet edgy touch.  And as a bonus, the  cast album contains the rocking track &quot;Random Number Generation,&quot;  to better show off Miriam Shor's incredible talent!
B000009ED0|1.0|His music is the most horrid thing I have ever listened to. The lyrics are offensive to many people, sexes, and races. I don't recommened this book to anyone under 15 b/c of the unbeilivable frequent language and other &quot;R  rated reasons. I hope this stops you from buying or listening to him. Thank  you for reading this.
0880381736|5.0|Hi!  This story has to be one of the best I have read in quite a while.  I tried to read Ann McCaffrey and, well, was dissappointed.  Then I read the Enchanted Forest Chronicles, which I greatly enjoyed but it left me wanting  something.  After which I read the Wheel of Time Series.  I loved it, but  it was a hard read.  This book is great for those who have a harder time  reading, or are just too lazy to read Robert Jordan (like me ^_^).  The  style itself is very close to that of The Hobbit.  There are many  differences, though.  I read this book for a book report, but I had to  finish the trilogy.  Now I have to present it to the class and the three  are blending in my head and I can't draw lines where one stops and another  begins.  This is a good thing: The transition from one book to another is  very smooth, unlike Wheel of Time where I had to read fast and furiously to  catch up to where the story started.  O.K.  Enough with my long winded  speech of how wonderful entering the world of Krynn is through the  imaginative writings of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.  I  think that  everyone should at the very least give this story a try, whether or not  you're a fantasy lover.
0671042858|4.0|I thought that &quot;The Girl who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; was an excellent depiction of what it would be like to be lost.  Getting lost in the woods is a lot easier than most people think.  King describes everything how it  should be and the God of the lost was an exellent touch.
B00004T8RK|3.0|If Pearl Jam had existed in the late seventies I think this is the record they would have released. It is a really good rock record but it doesn't have that nineties magic that Pearl Jam had. Anyway, I haven't analized the  words of every song but I'm sure they are exellent in meaning and impact as  they always are.
B00004T8RK|3.0|I am a huge PJ fan who is stuck in a rut of waiting for another &quot;great&quot; album from the band.  This album is worth owning and listening to, but for me it will never be a CD that I will want to come  back and hear again and again.  I think there are a couple of good songs on  the CD, but the rest are so diluted with wacky lyrics and melodies that  they just are not interesting to me.
B000002HMH|5.0|Just when will the whining stop?  Yeah, so Metallica changed on this album, but who cares?  They are still an awesome band.  How can you hear songs like &quot;Ain't My Bitch&quot; and &quot;King Nothing&quot; and put  this album down?  Okay, so it's not as good as the old stuff, it doesn't  compare to &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; or &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;  (but then again what does?), but that doesn't mean it isn't worth getting.  Many complain about &quot;Hero of the Day&quot;, but why?  Believe it or  not, I actually LIKE the song!  People also say that &quot;Mama Said&quot;  is too country-sounding, but I'd just like to hear Garth Brooks pull it  off.  After all, Hetfield's voice is good (not country-sounding) and the  lyrics are really good (nothing redneck about em).  Faves would have to be  &quot;Ain't My Bitch&quot;, &quot;King Nothing&quot;, Bleeding Me&quot;,  and the hated &quot;Hero of the Day&quot;.  All Metallica rules, and that's  a fact.  And, if you think I don't listen to really heavy stuff because I  like this album, I'd like to point out that I also like Fear Factory and  Machine Head, who are both heavier than anything by Metallica.  So, fans of  hard stuff and soft stuff alike should enjoy this album.  It is very good.
0140288503|5.0|This is an excellent piece of modern American history.  Black Hawk Down is also a wake up call to any policy makers who have taken the Gulf War as proof positive that Military intervention will always work in the new  century.<br />Mark Bowden manages to give the reader a good impression of the  overall situation in Somalia in addition to the electrifying events of that  ill fated mission in October.  This is a very good aspect of the book,  because it is here that the general reader and future policy maker will  gain the most insight.  Technological superiority does not insure an easy  military success.  Gunships and night vision goggles do not equal  victory.<br />As the battle rages through the streets of Somalia, you will  find yourself having to take some time off, in order to catch your breath.  Bowden's writing is as telling as Spielburg's directing in Saving Private  Ryan.  Not only is there an honest and smooth account of combat, but the  humor that manifests itself in these terrible situations is also brought  out with ease.<br />I did find myself fliping to the index when a name came  back that I recognized but could not remember exactly- that is one of the  few shortfalls Bowden's tale posesses: an amazing quantity of characters.  They are hard to keep track of.  I needed to remind myself that I was  reading history, and not an adventure novel.  It shamed me to think that I  could read like that, but you might find yourself falling into the same  trap that Bowden's prose led me.  All in all, I am glad that Bowden has  give us the story the way he has, with as few as possible ommitted details  and in a way that is so easy to access.
1568493207|5.0|Well, if you're used to John Grisham or the Bronte sisters, you're probably not gonna like this book.  But read it anyway just to see what the fuss is all about.<br />This is a classic of postmodern disjointedness,  brimming with Pynchonian playfulness, recurring themes,  jokes-within-a-jokes, literary allusions, the poetry of mathematics, and  everything else you could want in a nice quick under-200pg read.<br />The text  is pretty dense, but then again, see Gravity's Rainbow if you want to see  something really dense.  I suggest starting over every time you get really  confused -- it certainly took me a few start-overs to truly appreciate this  novel.<br />Highly recommended if you like inventiveness, or novels that are  more &quot;writerly&quot; than &quot;readerly&quot; -- that give the reader  most of the burden of creating meaning.
B000002O1P|5.0|&quot;Full Moon Fever&quot; may have spawned bigger sales, but &quot;Southern Accents&quot; is Tom Petty's best album.  With production help from Eurythmic Dave Stewart, Petty incorporates synthesizers into his  sound as on the weird &quot;Don't Come Around Here No More.&quot;  What  really shines is the songwriting, the best that he's ever done.  &quot;With  &quot;Rebels&quot; and the title track, he finally acknowledges his Dixie  roots, which is a welcome element.  The song closes with two excellent  songs, &quot;Mary's New Car&quot; and the horn-laden &quot;The Best of  Everything.&quot;  This is truly Petty at his best.
0375411550|5.0|This is an excellent book.   I actually read some of the paragraphs out loud just because they sounded so beautiful.....I don't agree with the authors conclusion in the &quot;afterward&quot; that she, the author,  should not have assembled  the narrative into &quot;parts that had to be  reassembled by the reader&quot;.   I thought it worked extremely well.   I  usually get bored reading about the characters' family, their parents and  grandparents, etc., but in THIS book, I was in awe of the author that she  could make me enjoy reading about every single character in the book.  I  believe that Toni Morrison actually DID lead her readers &quot;into an  interrogation of themselves for the smashing.&quot; That outweighed the  pity we felt for the character.  This book deserved the Nobel Prize - which  it won.   This book is worth the price and was a pleasure to read.  This is  from a middle-aged white lady who also grew up and lives with a  &quot;crooked foot&quot;.  Thanks Toni.
B000002PBL|4.0|Following his breakthrough album &quot;Damn the Torpedoes,&quot; &quot;Hard Promises&quot; is equally good with a number of first rate songs.  The band has rarely sounded better.  &quot;The Waiting&quot; is the  best known song, but others stand out such as &quot;Letting You Go,&quot;  &quot;A Woman in Love,&quot; and the Stevie Nicks duet &quot;Insider.&quot;  Petty's best albums are remarkably consistent, with no bad songs.  This  one is no exception.
B00004SCX6|5.0|britney's new cd, &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot; is a great cd.  I went and picked up the album right after i got out of school today.  My fav songs are oops i did it again, stronger, lucky, and satisfaction but the  whole cd is great and i recomend you go pick it up right away:-)
0451169514|4.0|Stephen King has always been hit-or-miss for me. But in this work, he has shown more complexity and depth than in any of his other strictly-horror pieces - and I've had the mixed blessing of reading them all.  In It, we  find him grabbing ahold of many fears we experienced or knew of in our  childhoods - fear and imaginary.  The carrier of these fears, the IT of It,  is a creative one both for its own sake and King's.  Using subtlety this  time around, King illustrates scenes we could believe as happening, if we  were the sort of believe in ghosts and other nasti beasties. One of his  standard shortfalls is to have characters produce reactions that I find  hard to believe human beings would exhibit under certain circumstances  (even non-imaginary circumstances) - fortunately, this doesn't happen too  often in this particular writing. Slight spoiler:  it falls apart at the  end somewhat, as he just keeps wanting to escalate the scale of the events  in the book, but then can't stop himself.  This has also occasionally been  a problem with King's writings.  However, you have a group of likable  characters, a smaller group of disalikable ones and a bad...something...who  produces nausea in all the right ways.
B00003CXBK|2.0|I'm a big fan of most of Miyazaki's films (especially &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;), but this film is a disaster.  The art is beautiful, and I've seen both the Japanese version (with english subtitles) and the American  version.  I originally thought that the director was taking for granted  that I might understand some of the Japanese legends, but just about all of  my Japanese friends said they didn't understand it at all, either.  They  likened it to a Japanese &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; --another film that is  really poorly constructed and has lousy animation.  Japanese animation  often looks beautiful and is well choreographed--but they still can't tell  consistantly coherant stories.
B0000028W9|5.0|Leonard Cohen is the head of my religion, the priest of my philosophy, perhaps ahead of myself. His ability to use language as the voice of G_d  and imagery as the paintbrush for Creation continually astound me and do  not fail with The Future.<br />You don't get the edge one finds in his voice  by simply getting older, doing drugs, having heartbreak - the experience  one finds there bespeaks of all of those things and more - both peace and  rage at the beauty and loss in the world - fear and hope of things that  have passed and have yet to come.<br />It may be cliche to attribute so much  to music and song, but without shame I say these things of this artist and  this specific album.  It reinvigorates my faith in humankind and my self to  listen to the words and chords struck by this master of the craft, who  would deny everything I've said in this review.
6304698658|3.0|Very funny entry in the Vacation series.  Everyone here is in slapstick form.  Thankfully, John Hughes took over Directing chores after the disasterous Jeremiah Chechick nearly destroyed the film.  Funny animated  titles (look for Santa's &quot;privates&quot; when he's electrocuted on the  chimney! ) although the opening song by Cynthia Weill and Barry Mann is  TERRIBLE.  Angelo Badalamenti's score is great, and I wished he'd have  scored the title sequence!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Possibly the quickest turnaround in the history of pop music, the sequel to Britney shed-load selling  debut arrives promising more of the same  helium voiced, thumping beat eurodance as before. Don't worry about new  musical direction or 'growing up', this is a sophomore album every bit as  childishly appealing as its predecessor. 'Oops!' faithfully recreates all  of the elements that made 'Baby...' such a smash with a big beat, an  abba-esque harmony running through the chorus, and a cheeky lyric that  suggests she knows more than she's letting on. Surprisingly though, it's  not the best cut on the CD, that honour falls to the aptly named  'Stronger'. The kind of song you'll be singing along to before you've heard  the whole thing, this is going to be most people's favourite Britney song.   Max Martin, the Swedish uber-producer behind N'Sync, Backstreet Boys and  Solid harmonie, is clearly on safe ground here, and his many contributions  to this album would probably feel equally at home on albums by any of those  artists. Other songs to watch out for are the Shania and Mutt-composed  'Don't let me be the last to know' which manages to be strong enough to let  you forget its quite awful opening notes, 'Lucky' which suggests that being  the planet's most popular teen-queen ain't all it's cracked up to be and  the bonus track 'girl in the mirror' which is only available on the  European version of the disc. Unfortunately, as the album progresses it  runs out of steam and ends with a couple of unappealing ballads. 'When Your  Eyes say it' is Diane warren on auto-pilot (as she has been for a good few  years) and 'Dear Diary' is Britney's half-hearted attempt at coining in  some songwriting royalties.   One other negative aspect about this album,  is it's over-reliance on spoken-word interludes. While I'm thankful that  Britney and co didn't list them as tracks to make us think we were getting  more songs, I really could do without Britney and her girlfriends saying  'Oh my god, you kissed him! ' and 'Ok so like, maybe I'm picky...' Enough  already, just sing! All in all though, it's  strong CD with at least 8 good  tracks.  Here's looking forward to next year's update.
0679746048|5.0|I thought that this book gave a very vivid look inside the world of a girl in a mental institution and the interactions between her and the other patients.  Having seen the movie, the book is different.  The book is a  must read if you have indeed seen the movie.  It gives you a closer look  into Susanna Keyshen's life while she was institutionalized.  Very good  book!  A must for any home library
0316777722|4.0|David Sedaris's latest is both memoir and travelogue, a compilation of the foibles and reflections of the sardonic social critic and humorist. Made popular by 1998's Naked and long-standing appearances on NPR, Sedaris again  delivers the same wit and insight as in previous volumes, with the addition  of his skewed version of the American living abroad-in this case, France.  Sedaris's family and upbringing are the subject of many of the essays, most  notably \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster,\\" a hilarious description of the  fantastically foul-mouthed youngest member of the Sedaris clan. \\"Twelve  Months in the Life of the Artist,\\" delves into Sedaris's brief stint in the  land of human hair sculpture and performance art. Equally raucous and  charming as the family pieces are Sedaris's commentaries on French culture.  Having gone to live in France with his boyfriend, Sedaris finds himself  mired in a new culture and-much to his horror-a new language, the  consonants and vowels of which both escape and dumbfound him. The title  essay takes its name for one of many classroom scenes in which Sedaris  attempts, along with other, equally handicapped students, to master French.  Enter the sadistic French teacher who mocks student responses and a scene  in which the multi-ethnic classroom tries to explain the differences  between French and American observance of Easter, revealing the inherent  idiocy of the both versions. In \\"Picka Pocktoni,\\"  Sedaris finds himself  face-to-face with two American tourists who assume that he is both French  and-as they loudly and damningly discuss-a body-odor-ridden subway  pickpocket. Sedaris's razor-sharp insights and devious queries into human  nature make him the popualr humorist he is and will remain, wehther  imported or domestic.
B00004SCX6|4.0|while it would've been complete to have another enhanced cd with a music video or two on it, this cd is still worthwhile. she tries a few new techniques and it shows. this will probably become a big seller like her  last one did.....just give it some time and the sales will go up and more  videos will be made too. it's all britney here.
B00004SCX6|5.0|One word for the second album of britney spears is &quot;WOW! &quot; Its got REALLY good music and music that us teenagers can relate too! I think britney spears is really defining our generation with a feeling of tuffness  and sweetness!  She was so cute on SNL and britney live on MTV was really  phat! britney ggggrrrrrrllllllllllllllll i love u alot!  u r the only  performer that i would pay alot of bucks to see!  I pre paid for the oops i  did it again cd like 2 weeks ago!  this is how much i love britney  spears... BRITNEY SEE U NJ TRUMP TAJ MAHAL AUGUST  25THHHHH!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam has struck gold. When i first listened to this cd, i thought,&quot;this is great!.&quot; This cd is powered by &quot;insignificance&quot; (top 3 best ever by pj) and &quot;nothing as it  seems&quot; (great slow song). But the good songs do not stop there, there  are the soft/hard ballads &quot;thin air&quot;, and &quot;light years&quot;  which are wonderful. Starting off the cd is &quot;breakerfall&quot;, which  is pretty heavy and rocking. &quot;breakerfall&quot; is close to the same  heaviness as number 3 &quot;evacuation.&quot; (just as great). The Cd  finishes out with &quot;parting ways&quot;, a soft and great song.  The  others arent as great but its hard to match 7 great songs. The others arent  terrible, just arent as good. Buy this cd as soon as you can.
B00004T8RK|4.0|It seems that with every new Pearl Jam album, I just don't &quot;get it&quot; at first.  Every time they release a new record, I'm initially disappointed with what I hear.  Their albums require...no, DEMAND multiple  listenings to fully take in the artistic vision of what exactly they're  trying to do.  &quot;Binaural&quot; is no different in this respect.  The  music is incredibly diverse and complicated.  Sometimes it rocks hard, but  a lot of the time, it's very ambient and gentle.<br />Pearl Jam is always  trying to throw us a curve ball musically.  After one listen, there are  very few apparent hooks musically or vocally.  Does this mean that I'll  never like this album?  Of course not.  I'll probably end up loving it.   I'm just not going to make any iron-clad statements about the long-term  quality of this record...not yet, at least...<br />One thing that I do notice  and appreciate is their decision to use a new producer.  Tchad Blake has  made some of my favorite albums with Los Lobos and Sheryl Crow among  others.  Not that Brendan O'Brien was uncapable in any way...he was great!   But change is always good, and I'm hearing his absence in the music.   Please pick up this album and judge for yourself, but don't pass judgement  after one listen.  Give it a week and see what you think.<br />Best song after  one listen: &quot;Light Years&quot;
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney has done it again with her new album: &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;. Most critics say an artists second album is their worst. Well that is not the case with Britney's new CD. This album far surpasses  anything I could have hoped for. With remakes of &quot;You got it all&quot;  and &quot;Satisfaction(I can't Get No)&quot; along side new songs  &quot;Stronger&quot; about female independence and &quot;Dear Diary&quot; a  song Britney wrote, this album is better than her first. One year has  really improved her maturity and her voice. I highly recommend this CD to  all Britney fans and even if you didn't like &quot;...Baby one more  time&quot; you should listen to this album, it may change your mind. I  believe even Britney's harshest critics might like her new sound. I  encourage you to buy this CD and look for it to win awards at the AMA's or  the Grammys!
B00000IPAX|5.0|My god, this is one of the best cds i have! I love this band, and there music is so meaningful, their voices blend just right with the music, and there lyrics even i can relate to. I call blink 182 a clear, well thought  out, down to earth band. If u haven't been listening to them, u are missing  so much! luv ya'll Blink 182 fan =)
0316777722|5.0|&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is the most enjoyable read I have had so far this year. Anyone who has read &quot;Naked&quot; will appreciate the continuing adventures of David Sedaris. There is no other writer who can  tell a story like this man. (No, I'm not one of his sisters). &quot;Me Talk  Pretty One Day&quot; is comprised of various essays about family,  relationships, New York, France, pets and the most interesting situations  that happen in the life of this most talented writer. This book will make  you laugh out loud, particularly if you have ever thought of yourself or  your family as eccentric. I thank David Sedaris for speaking out in such an  honest way about his life for our reading pleasure. Can't wait for the next  book!
B00004T8RK|5.0|With everyone waiting for the next &quot;TEN&quot; album, I can honestly say dont hold your breath. Pearl Jam has evolved with their music, and so have their fans. This album has a very distinctive sound, much like the  Who. It has feeling and originality, something most music these days lacks.  If your a true Pearl Jam fan you will enjoy the album, but if you are just  looking for the &quot;Jeremy&quot; &quot;Black&quot; or &quot;Alive&quot; I  recomend buying one of their live albums.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I initially purchased this CD for my husband because he liked \\"Nookie\\". I will admit I did not like Limp Bizkit initially but after listening to the CD I realized that it was really great. It is rappy but at the same time alternative. I believe the best song on the CD is \\"Break Things\\". The words are great for when you are having a bad day.
0783241569|5.0|What a thoroughly charming and engaging movie.  A movie that is bound to be a classic.  Julia Roberts does a fantastic job as the weary superstar finally finding love with an ordinary &quot;Joe&quot; travelbook shop owner  played by Hugh Grant.  The supporting actors and actresses in this movie  are pure joy to see and develop the plot nicely.  A movie that the whole  family can enjoy.  Hollywood has captured the magic and beauty again in  this &quot;old fashioned&quot; romance.  Highly recommended to all.  Get it  today!
6302038308|2.0|Well, I think this movie isn't about horror. It's just a kind of child's playing! This is a real ridiculous movie. my advice? don't buy it!
B00004SCX6|5.0|This new CD is so awesome.  The songs are so diverse and catchy. This album is ten times as good as the first one and everyone should buy it!  I wasnt a Britney fan until I heard songs from this album on Britneys First  Listen.  Buy the album!
0792151712|3.0|The special effects are unforgettable. The movie itself is not forgettable. But I don't think it should have been a Best Picture movie. This movie was definetely overrated at the time of release.<br />  However,  the movie is enjoyable and somewhat likeable. Nothing more than that,  though.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Ok, this CD is pretty good. The title track is great. I like &quot;Stronger&quot; and &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; the best. The latter is a great ballad that everyone can relate to. I took a star off because,  um, she has obviously never heard the Stones. The &quot;Satisfaction&quot;  remake is horrible. I think I could sing it better chomping on gum. If she  wants to remake songs, she should at leats listen to it first.
6304938276|2.0|This sequel to the 1997 slasher/thriller has some scares and the end is perfect. However, since the first one was so good, I expected this movie to be a little bit better, but hey! it's good. Campbell is a little less  convincing, but Cox is getting more convincing. The plot cooks up in many  parts, but as scary as it was, I didn't jump once.       On a final note,  the movie was somewhat predictable. From a scale of 1 to 10, a 3.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver is an excellent book for all ages.  It is very interesting and makes you read straight through to the end.  The story is about a twelve year old boy named Jonas.  Jonas lives in a futuristic society that is  &quot;perfect.&quot; The community is controlled by sameness and everyone  is exactly alike.  The people have no recellection of their past and have  no feelings.  They have never experienced love or hate.  Though it may  sound ideal, as you read, Jonas discovers through his highly respected and  important job that perhaps things could be better.  In his job he must keep  the memories of the past so that the rest of the community does not have to  experience them.  Despite his memories of death, war, hunger, and such, he  begins to realize that the good memories overpower the bad ones.  In his  desperation from loneliness and frustration Jonas makes a drastic decision,  that will change the lives of the community forever.  I really enjoyed this  book, as I have read it more than once.  The only downside that I found to  it was the ending.  I have never liked endings that leave you hanging, as  this one does, and I wish that there was a sequal.  But, in general, I  recommend this book to people of all ages.  Enjoy!

B00003CWTH|5.0|Despite what many other people felt, I didn't like 'Boogie Nights,&quot; Paul Thomas Anderson's second film, very much.  I thought it was a little drawn out and that a little more editing could have hurt it much.  I also found it to be a bit depressing.        P.T. Anderson's first film,  &quot;Hard Eight&quot; was not great, but it's worth watching.       &quot;Magnolia&quot; (named for the street on which the film opens with -  after the film's prologue) is easily P.T. Anderson's best film and also one  of the year's best films.  I enjoyed the film more than any other I saw  this year, but I feel &quot;American Beauty&quot; was a better film and  deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture.  I feel that Tom Cruise  was robbed of the award for Best Supporting Actor (Michael Caine?  Yes, he  did a good job in &quot;The Cider House Rules,&quot; a GOOD job, but that  accent seemed a bit off and Tom Cruise, Haley Joel Osment, Michael Clarke  Duncan, and Jude Law all gave better performances).        The film also  should have won Best Original Screenplay (or possibly also &quot;Being John  Malkovich&quot;).        But, of course the film won nothing, and only  received three nominations (it was also nominated for Best Song - Aimee  Mann.  I know, that's not the best song in the movie, but the song the  whole cast sings along with was written for &quot;Jerry Maguire' and thus  not allowed to be submitted).      Everyone should see &quot;Magnolia&quot;  once it is released on video.  The performances are some of the best any of  these actors/actresses have ever given.  Writer/director P.T. Anderson  delivers a brilliant script as well as incredibly directing. The way he  used the songs to tie one scene to the next is incredibly original (not to  mention the scene were the cast sings along to Mann's song, and the other  very bizarre scene involving frogs). The film deserved to make ten times as  much as it did at theaters, but I hope people will have heard about it and  will rent it or buy this masterpiece.       If it's at all possible, this  is a great film to see at theaters but if it's not, RENT/BUY THIS MOVIE!
0517122707|5.0|This is one of my favorite books, and my very favorite comedy. The tale is  set in New Orleans, the characters are wonderfully flawed, and the author's  style is unique. This novel won the Pulitzer prize for literature in the  1980's.     It has a cult following, of which I am a member.
0790736314|5.0|&quot;The Exorcist&quot; is easily the best horror film every made (it was also nominated for SEVEN ACADEMY AWARDS).  It is both immensely mature and intelligent in the way it deals with its subject and never plays its  disturbing content for laughs. This film is not for those easily offended  either. The film allows a 12 year old girl (Linda Blair was fourteen, but  she plays a twelve year old) to use extremely sexualy explicit dialogue  that would instantly get this film an NC-17 rating today (why this film was  not rated X in 1973 I don't know).  The violence is graphic and disturbing  as well as its sexual content.  &quot;The Haunting&quot;'s director, Jan De  Bont once said that &quot;The Exorcist&quot; could not be made today and  get an R rating; it would without a doubt be rated NC-17.  That aside, the  film is both the most frightening horror film ever made, as well the most  intelligent and best made.
B0000027RL|5.0|Every song on ten is good.Ten defines inportant music, it captures the true feeling of alienation and being alone on songs like jeremy, and black.The it also makes you want to get up and just  and feel the music   with songs like Alive, Even flow, and porsch. This is a Great album.to me  it is my favorite record ever written thanx to eddie and the boys. The  words are meaningful and dark. ITS the perfect record to listen to to lift  your Spirits up, when your down.
0553347845|4.0|After wanting to read RF for a long time, I finally got a book. This was the first Feynman book I read. It has two parts, the first is mostly about Feynman's first wife Arlene and his friends when he was a young man. The  second tells us how Feynman investigated the Challenger explosion. The book  is not technical, the second part is a bit more detailed and might tell you  more about rocket engines that you would like to know, but the whole book  is very interesting. I particulary enjoyed the first part, how Feynman  decided to still marry Arlene not matter what everyone else was telling  him, and how special their relationship was.  Feynman is a brillian man,  yet funny and modest, he even shares some of his embarassing moments.  I  became a fan and am now going for more Feynman books. A first part for your  heart, and a second part for your brain.  Some were just random thoughts,  with no order at all, and it was a bit confusing sometimes for someone who  didn't know Feynman's life, but still, this was a delicious book and I  strongly recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading about the  people who make brilliant science... and still have a sense of humor. :)
B00004SCX6|5.0|bitney new cd is a lot better than her old one her other one was like a little girl singing little girl songs but this one has a lot of mature songs that i like especially Stronger it is a very good cd that you will  get used to it i guess she needs some more songs with beat that is the only  fault most songs are slow but it is worth buying it again buy it you will  like it
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends was the first Radiohead album I ever bought. Having only heard Creep (Pablo Honey) and Paranoid Android (OK Computer) - and with the assurances of a friend - prior to listening to this album, my only  expectation was that it was worth the Australian retail price. Well, to  say that it made an impression is the greatest understatement of all time.  The vocal and musical range attained in this masterpiece is the work of a  truely passionate and talented lot and I can only wonder at the  uninterested baboons, who are the Australian commercial radio scene, not  even giving it a chance.  Each track is so intense and powerful that it's  impossible to single out any favourites. So much so that anyone without The  Bends is missing out on a big piece of music history.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Of all the Video Collections from the Music world this is the most complete and utterly entertaining. This collection includes everything!  It took me back to my high school days when I first saw the video for How Will  I Know and brought me right up to 2000. Wildly entertaining I LOVED IT!
6305428220|4.0|The Faculty is a fine teen thriller from Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk to Dawn) and the screenplay by one of Hollywood's finest writers Kevin Williamson ('Scream', 'Scream 2' 'I know what you did last summer' and TV's  'Dawson's Creek'). When I heard that Williamson was involved with this  movie I had to see it, and I was not disappointed. The Faculty is a  well-made and written movie about Aliens trying to take over a school in  American. The movie is hip, scary and even funny in parts and includes a  fine cast of up and coming young actors. This film will appeal to fans of  scream as well as fans of 'Dawson's Creek', this is a fine movie. I just  hope Rodriguez and Williamson team up again!
B00004T8RK|4.0|When I think of Pearl Jam's early output compared to the newer stuff, I am amazed at how much they have altered their sound.  Binaural is pretty much the next step in the progression the band has been making over the course  of the last 3 studio albums.  Binaural's strong points are a bit different  than those on Yeild or No Code.  Where in the past the band has had a  balance of great fast and slow songs, on this one the slower, more brooding  songs are what make it work.  Many of these songs will not garner radio  play because they are either too long, too short, or too experimental, but  they are good none the less.  This is definately PJ's most baroque work  todate.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|This movie is the best drama ever made.  It makes such a huge difference on DVD.  It has some of the most beautiful cinematography i have ever seen, and the action scenes are riveting.  Daniel Day Lewis and Madiline Stowe  give the best performances of their careers.
B00004SCX6|4.0|As \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\" begins, be prepared for a meaner, sassier, more seductive Britney Spears. That's not a bad thing; in fact, it works for several tunes, in sharp contrast to the lovesick Britney that does prevail  as the CD progresses. We get to see two sides of Britney here, the one  we're used to -- and which helped make her a superstar -- and a darker side  fit to burst. Many of the songs are more bluesy and strike harder:  \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\" thrives on her manipulative ways, although you know  her heart is aching underneath. \\"Stronger\\" revels in her new-found  independence. \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" works in ways the Rolling  Stones never anticipated: here she turns the tables on everything we know  in regard to that song, from tempo to innuendo. Once upon a time the  original version bit hard, then it became familiar, now it's so dang  classic we just go along with it whenever it's played. Britney reinvents it  and makes it her own. You're either gonna love it or hate it. She  definitely overcomes the sophomore jinx with this second CD. \\"Oops...\\" is a  far stronger work than \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" with catchier songs,  subtler lyrics, and instrumental surprises. You'll be humming these tunes  all summer. The only clinker is \\"Dear Diary\\" (it may grow on me in time,  but I'm not getting my hopes up). There are distractions, notably way too  much talking, and the insipid dialogue sputtered in the middle of the title  track practically derails the song. It's not necessary for Britney to  alleviate the tension by being cute and overtly clever. But, you know, I  can forgive her that because she really does have talent and the capability  of growing into her art, in time producing some truly respectable material  (as opposed to nothing but first-rate pop songs). For now, she's hot, she's  hip, she's sexy (and sexual), and she satisfies.
0425129616|5.0|For anyone just starting to read mystery novels and particularly anyone who is new to Agatha Christie, I would highly recommend starting with this, the first Poirot mystery.  Poirot has recently come to England as a WW1 war  refugee.  Shortly after his arrival, he encounters an old friend Captain  Hastings, who serves as the perfect Watson to Poirot's Holmes.  An old lady  who had been of great help to Poirot is murdered and he feels an obligation  to find her killer.  A simple premise but Christie builds a wonderfully  complex mystery upon it, with multiple suspects, several red herrings and a  lot of atmosphere.  The ending is a genuine shocker and the mystery is  nicely interposed with comedic moments due to Captain Hastings' various  observations about life and love, most of which show his intelligence to be  decidedly inferior to that of his little Belgian friend!  Definitely do not  miss - you will thoroughly enjoy it!
B00003CWL5|4.0|This movie was good, but it is nothing compared to the kind of press it got.  Every year it seems, the media picks up on an &quot;intellectual&quot; movie to praise so they can seem intelligent. This  movie was the entry for 1999.  Kevin Spacey is entertaining as Lester and  the rest of the actors are fine, especially Thora Birch who plays the  harried daughter perfectly.  <br />Unfortunately, for me, the film seemed to  be content to go over stuff that has been worked through many times in the  1990s.  Dysfunctional families like this in 1997s Ice Storm, a few Usual  Suspects style plot twists, and a Lolita complex.  What is so special about  Sam Mendes' contribution to this film is, I do not know. It just looks like  a competently shot film with a few dream sequences in which rose petals  (hammer us with the symbolism a little more why don't you?) float around a  lot.  The Rickey Fitts character is also a little disappointing, being used  a) as a weirdo for visual purposes/ directing gimmicks and b) as a  mouthpiece for the film's philosophy-lite.  <br />It was a good movie, but if  you really want a film that looks into twisted human nature, go watch  Herzog, not Sam Mendes. If you want to learn to appreciate beauty in the  world, take a walk in the woods.  I don't think this film really knew what  it wanted to do. Did it want to teach you a lesson, or did it want to shock  you with taboos that have been gone over a hundred times?  Watch the film.  It is interesting, but watching it does not mean opening up Pandora's box  as many have suggested.
B00003CWL5|2.0|So now vulgarity gets the Oscar.  Do I need my nose rubbed in vulgarity to make a point with me? No.  I'm not that thick, and most other people aren't either.  Yes, I can see the point Lester makes at the end, but sadly, too  many people were offended by this movie to even GET the point.  Do some  people actually think Americans invented materialism, hypocrisy?  Study  history, and ancient history at that (I thought some of the examples to  make these points were ludicrous).  My opinion?  The dumber the person, the  greater they consider this movie.  The more offended they are, the higher  the intelligence.
031218087X|5.0|I have read Digital Fortress two times. I have read many books similar to Digital Fortress such as: Tom Clancy's Net Force and George Orwell's 1984. None of which are as exciting or thrilling as Digital Fortress. Dan Brown  should write many more books of this genre and I look forward to reading  his latest book, Angels &amp; Demons.
0790733897|5.0|In all of his twenty-six movies, Steve McQueen only played a cop once, and when he did, it was a good one.  In \\"Bullitt,\\" directed by Peter Yates, McQueen is Detective Lieutenant Frank Bullitt of the San Francisco P.D.   Politician Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) is bringing in a witness from  Chicago who is scheduled to testify in a trial that promises to have a  devastating effect on the crime hierarchy of the Windy City. If all goes as  planned, it promises to have a substantial effect of Chalmers' political  career, as well.  He hand-picks Bullitt and his partner, Delgetti (Don  Gordon), to guard the witness, Johnny Ross (Pat Renella), whose testimony  is to be the key element of the prosecution.  Without Ross, they have no  case.  But Ross' co-operation turns out to be a set up.  The \\"Ross\\" who  shows up in San Francisco and is promptly sequestered away in a hotel by  Bullitt, is really a man named Renick (Felice Orlandi), paid to stand in  for Ross, and never intended to make it to the trial.  Renick thinks he's  to be sprung for a long vacation in Rome, but the whole scam quickly goes  bad; Renick ends up dead, and the third man of Bullitt's team, Stanton  (Carl Reindel) winds up in the hospital, lucky to be alive after being on  the receiving end of a shotgun blast.  McQueen gives one of his best  performances as the stoic and uncompromising Bullitt, the cop who's seen it  all and who has no delusions as to the state of the world in which he  lives, nor of its seemingly endless capacity for evil.  In one scene, he  goes to a motel for what he believes will be a routine follow-up on a tip,  a name and address that's surfaced during his investigation.  It's a nice  day and a long drive, so his girlfriend, Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset)  accompanies him; a rare chance to spend some time together.  What he finds  at the motel, however, instead of information on a name, is a particularly  gruesome homicide.  And before he can stop her, Cathy walks in on it.   Ultimately, she is just as appalled by Bullitt's jaded reaction to such a  heinous sight, as by the murder itself.  She asks him how he can stand it,  spending so much of his time in the gutter.  \\"That's where half of it is,\\"  he tells her.  Written by Alan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner (adapted  from Robert L. Pike's novel, \\"Mute Witness\\"), the plot is fairly complex,  and Yates keeps the tension high throughout.  There's plenty of action,  highlighted by a car chase through the city, that finally winds up in the  countryside.  McQueen did his own driving in this sequence, which is  possibly the best ever filmed, and it set the standard for the entire  industry ever since.  McQueen in that Mustang, bouncing over the hills of  San Francisco, is an indelible moment in cinematic history.    The  outstanding supporting cast includes Simon Oakland (Captain Bennett),  Robert Duvall (Weissberg), Norman Fell (Captain Baker), Georg Stanford  Brown (Doctor Willard), Justin Tarr (Eddy) and Vic Tayback (Pete Ross).   Gordon is well cast as Delgetti, perfectly complementing McQueen's Bullitt;  they make one of the most memorable detective teams ever.  What really  makes this movie, though, is McQueen himself.  The cool, no-nonsense  persona, and the way he could convey so much with merely an expression; he  could speak volumes with a slight nod or a subtle lowering of the eyelids.   Extremely well presented, with an intelligent script and a great cast,  \\"Bullitt\\" is one of McQueen's best, and one you do not want to miss.
1573226521|5.0|The Beach is an unforgettable story. I have never read a book so well written. By the end you feel that you know Richard personally and although long and detailed, it flows so easily and keeps you hooked so that you  simply can't bear to put it down.
B00000G6KG|5.0|You thought the next albums weren't good.  Well don't listen to it!   All of them are fantastic.  That is free expression of the mind.  I think the albums keep getting better &amp; better.  By the way, why don't you get a  life!  The 1st actual album was NOT Reign In Blood, but it was Show No  Mercy!   I have been a fan from the start, so don't even think you can  review!
B00000J2KT|2.0|It really makes me angry that this DVD is not in letterbox format. It's just the standard tv size. Which really really is a shame. This really is a great movie too, the standard tv size just doesn't do it justice at all.  These Kubrick collection DVDs seem like they were just slapped together  with no real thought. Maybe someday this will be available in the far  superior letterbox format. Until then, go to your local Blockbuster and  rent the VHS version.<br />there is no excuse for this.
0767836286|4.0|My wife &amp; I got this move on the advise of a friend who said it had a great twist at the end.  If you love conspiracy theories this one will bowl you over - just be prepared to accept lots of implausabilities.  (We also  had problems with the special features working on our DVD player)
B00004T8RK|5.0|Don't listen to negative reviews of this album, if any.  This album is almost better than Yield, and most certainly gives me that good feeling that Vitalogy did when I first heard it.  The first song  &quot;Breakerfall&quot; sets you up for whats to come, then the fast paced  &quot;God's Dice&quot;.  Other very notable, great songs are  &quot;Insignificance&quot; and &quot;Grievance&quot;.<br />After all the  years Pearl Jam has gone through, and all the drummers they've had, they've  aged like a fine wine.  They still rule.  Great job on the new album guys.
0671027344|4.0|Do you know a wallflower?  Would you like them to change?  If so, I recommend you force them to read this book.  &quot;The Perks fo Being a Wallflower&quot; by Stephen Chbosky is a wonderful lesson of why not to be  a wallflower.  Charlie; the boy who watches his life pass him by; the  wallflower; is a seriously disturbed young man.  From his experiments with  drug abuse to his own sexuality, he seems to have no self identity.  He  observes people, reads books, over analyzes everything, and cries  chronically.  He never appears to come in full contact with himself, with  his thoughts.  He loves his friends and his family, but he doesn't  understand why.  He never seems to grasp much of anything-perhaps its due  to his non-stop analyzing and observing.  Charlie is most certainly a  wallflower.  A passive person waiting for things to happen for him, and  worrying about things he can't change.  I don't understand what perks there  are to being a wallflower, especially not if Charlie is the type of person  one would become.  Get out and live your life, and read this book if you  need motivation to do so.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I rushed out to get this and was a bit disappointed.  There are a few great songs on there like &quot;light years&quot;, &quot;rival&quot;, &quot;God's Dice&quot;. Maybe it will grow on me.  How bad can any pearl  jam album be anyway?
630575067X|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the original saga, but TPM is just a huge disappointment. Gone are all the things that made episodes 4-6 great. Well... you all know what they are.<br />Hopefully, Episode II won't be as  bad.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I have heard clips of the songs on the internet and I had to get the cd when it came out.  Now I have it and I'm glad I spent the money.  Britney Spears is an awesome singer despite the rumors.  All the fans should go out  and buy this cd.  Many people say all the songs sound the same, but I think  many of them seem alot different, and I love it!  Plus, she's like 50 times  better than 'N Sync and BSB together!
6305364613|5.0|The 1960's version of this film put me to sleep and it had no appeal to anyone but  shakespeare finatics. Well, I'm sorry. Shakespeare lived in a whole different setting where people were entertained by different things.  I love the way the spruced this story up. This was a lot easier to follow  than the older one and really brings out the beauty of the movie. Although  I hate Leo, he did a good job, and like any other good leo movie he dies at  the end.

B000001GXE|3.0|The performance maybe good, but the sound is not what I expected.
0345345061|5.0|This book contain's Tolkien's shorter fiction and works, including a play and Leaf by Niggle.  There are four works in total:<br />1.  The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth, Beorhthelm's Son: a play dealing with two men after the Battle  of Maldon.  Interesting, and shows more of the scholarly side of  Tolkien.<br />2.  Tree and Leaf: This is a book consisting of two things: his  essay on faerie tales, and Leaf By Niggle.  Tolkien's essay is now  considered one of the main centerpieces of literature defending and  validating fantasy and faerie tale (as if THE LORD OF THE RINGS and THE  HOBBIT weren't enough).  Leaf By Niggle is a very deep work, and basically  it deals with his despair of mortality and not being able to finish his  mythology, his great work.  However, in the end Tolkien shows his glorious  hope.<br />3.  Farmer Giles of Ham: a mock medieval story.  Everything that  THE LORD OF THE RINGS represents, this story pokes fun at and parodies.  Very funny story, and shows Tolkien's sense of humour.  This was written  originally for his children (as much of his stuff was).<br />4.  The  Adventures of Tom Bombadil: This is a very misleading title.  It is a  collection of poetry, and only the first two poems have anything to do with  Bombadil.  The rest of the poetry deals with Middle-earth, or set therein.  It is a nice selection of his verse.<br />Overall, a well put together  anthology.  However, it would have been better had it included SMITH OF  WOOTTON MAJOR.  That, along with the two works constituting TREE AND LEAF,  is the closest thing to autobiography he ever wrote, and all three are  vitally important in any serious study of Tolkien.
B0000027DJ|5.0|Alice Cooper has another solid album with &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot;.  This album is similar to &quot;Trash&quot; in that it would definitely appeal to fans of melodic hard rock.  He DOES deviate a bit from the sex, love, and  failed relationships theme long enough to bring us the title track  &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; and &quot;Wind Up Toy&quot;.  &quot;Hey  Stoopid&quot; is an anti drug song, plain and simple.  &quot;Wind Up  Toy&quot; is about somebody in an asylum...a very Cooperesque theme.   &quot;Love's a Loaded Gun&quot; explores the dark side of a jilted lover,  while &quot;Burning Our Bed&quot; suggests and extreme way to deal with the  pain...&quot;Baby I'm burning our bed.&quot;  &quot;Might as Well Be On  Mars&quot; is a song pretty much everybody can relate to.  It's about  unrequited love &quot;I'm right in your back yard, and I might as well be  on Mars...You don't see me.&quot;  Pretty much the rest of the album is about  down and dirty sex.  &quot;Dirty Dreams, how ya gonna do me.&quot; and  &quot;Try to lose control.  I'll stain your soul to red from white.&quot;  are a few examples of the lyrics.  You get the picture.  Alice Cooper  proves once again that you can never go too far when exploring a subject.   I think the variation of theme and adding things like &quot;Wind Up  Toy&quot; may make this album more palatable to Alice fans that weren't as  enthusiastic about &quot;Trash&quot;, and I think if you DID like  &quot;Trash&quot; you'll like &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot;.  If you're a fan of  other bands within this end of the hard rock genre, you may be in for a  pleasant surprise.  Many of them have 1999-2000 releases.  After you pick  up your copy of &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; you should definitely go check out  some of your favorites.  Need a memory jog?  Click on over to my home page  on Amazon.  I have most of the bands reviewed or at least mentioned.  Are  you ready to rock? :o)
B00002E233|2.0|This is a bad action flick.  The basic plot is they (scientists) try to cure Alzheimer's and other brain diseases.  There is a serum in the shark's brain, but to make adequate amounts, they break some code of ethic (it is  named in the movie, but it escapes my memory).  Well, in the process of  doing so, it makes the sharks smarter.  It is a very run of the mill action  movie, bringing little invention to the genre.  It's a Jaws wannabe.   <br />One redeeming factor, however, is it will surprise you on who will live  and who will die.  During one scene, a character is making a good speech,  and then WHAM!  Everything JAWS tried, it succeeded.  I've heard the  sequels are terrible, but I haven't seen them..  But if you hold this  against JAWS, this fails terribly.  There is no suspense or terror in this  movie as in JAWS.   It saddens me that Jackson, a fine actor in his own  right, was in this movie.  He is also another redeeming factor in this  movie.  The cast does an alright job, bringing the script up a little - but  still, a pretty dismal effort.

Anyhow- whatever the heck kind of music you like- you will like this.
0425074811|5.0|When Aliens are mentioned people look around for the crazy guy who mentioned the &quot;A&quot; word. That subject gives people discomfort and a sense of skepticism. Daniken presents, in laymans terms his theory of  Paleo-Seti. There is enough evidence to state that there is some validity  in the book. From almost every culture have gods that decend from the sky  and give Knowledge to the masses. There are buildings all over the world  that couldn't have been built by such a primitive cultures Giza for one or  almost every Maya Building ever created. Scientist hold on to there Dogma  of how the world should be of course because we know everything about the  past. We know that MAN is the greatest thing ever to exist. MAN is master  of his domain nohing out anywhere is better than MAN. But to open minded  people who can't find very much wrong with his book fall upon ridicule from  the very people who should be interested in finding facts...Scientists.

6303921248|5.0|I stayed up late every night watching this miniseries when it premiered. I have rented it twice since, and am still amazed by how terrific it is! I am a junior in college, and the last time I rented it my two roomates and I  didn't move from the couch for six straight hours. All of the acting is  excellent, as is the chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth. Seeing this  movie has led me to read P&amp;P as well as Jane Austen's other novels. I  have seen the other versions, and neither is as true to the story and  characters as this one is. I would recommend this to anyone.
6300218031|5.0|A definite teen classic. Before teen movies became lustful sexfests like &quot;American Pie,&quot; Generation X-ers had a handful of teen epics that could be related to. It's definitely a feel-good movie and the acting is wonderful. As cheesy as some scenes might be, the overall effect overcomes the cheese-meter.<br />An introspective artist, a pretty rich girl and a smart-mouthed tom-boy look for love in all the wrong places until the end. Petty people become deep, true loves find one another... not exactly reality, but a great flick none-the-less. Perhaps it's nostalgia that puts this film in my personal 5-star category, but when I watch it as a full-fledged adult, I'm not looking back and thinking, &quot;boy was this flick stupid... I can't believe I liked it.&quot; Instead, I feel like I'm seeing it again for the first time. It's easy to get emotionally involved with these teens whose parents don't quite get the idea (as hard as some of them might try) of what's going on in their kids' lives.<br />Reminiscent of &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot;, all things work out in the end. This film didn't do as well in theaters as it could have because of the unconventional (read: weird) trailers that advertised the film. You just see bluejeans and a drummer hitting drums... I basically saw this film only because Eric Stoltz was in it... but I ended up adoring the film in spite of the cheesy trailer that promised nothing of substance. Gen-Y folks might find this a bit too bubble-gum, but if you're in your early 30s to late 20s and you haven't seen this film, it's your duty to see it. :-)<br />If you're a bit younger, give it a try. It may not be as &quot;sophisticated&quot; as films seem to be today, but it was right on target when it was released.<br />For parents, this film is safe to show to young teens. There is no nudity or sexual inuendo. There is a kissing scene that might cause you to have to fan yourself, but it's a kiss and not heavy petting or anything. There is language, but not above or beyond what can be heard on &quot;NYPD Blue.&quot; The film shows the values in true friendships, self-sacrifice, and true love based on sacrifice - not on sex, beauty or money. Relationships between parents and their children and between siblings is also explored in the film. Because of this, it actually has an underlying moral theme that is so lacking in films targeted to teens today.ge, but not above or beyond what can be heard on &quot;NYPD Blue.&quot; The film shows the values in true friendships, self-sacrifice, and true love based on sacrifice - not on sex, beauty or money.

B000002UB3|5.0|Following the magnum opus of the White Album, the Beatles regrouped after Christmastime to begin work on the Get Back/Let It Be project.  Early morning get-ups and ever-present film cameras aided in unravelling the  band.  Except for a few singles, recorded in 1969, it seemed as though the  Fab Four were through with each other.  In a last ditch effort, Paul  McCartney convinced George Martin to produce one more Beatles album (after  being insulted in his exclusion from production of the Let It Be album),  and the band rallied back.  Unlike other bands with similar fate (i.e., Led  Zeppelin's CODA, Cream's FAREWELL, and The Beach Boys' STARS &  STRIPES), the Beatles reunited for arguably their strongest album ever.  The  record opens with \\"Come Together\\", a funky Lennonism which  served as their greatest B side, and a string of finely crafted individual  songs. Only the pedestrian \\"Maxwell\\" was below par(though it was a #1 single in France). Ringo himself  penned the sequel to his \\"Yellow Submarine\\" vocal, with  \\"Octopus' Garden\\", and  George Harrison entered the (imaginary)  Songwriter's Hall Of Fame with his two contributions to this record,  \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" and the standard \\"Something\\".  The  second  half of the album is a song cycle compliments of the team of  Lennon/McCartney/Martin which has no rival on record other than Pete  Townsend's \\"A Quick One\\" and Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks'  \\"Heroes & Villains\\".  THIS ALBUM IS NOT FOR THE TEENYBOPPERS.  This is an adult album, made by men whose craft had become the music.  NO  MOPTOPS HERE.  The youthful songsmiths of \\"Love Me Do\\" and  \\"Don't Bother Me\\" have long grown up.  This is their legacy.

B00004SCX6|5.0|too all who are considering buying britney spears follow up to last years hit &quot;baby...one more time', well your in luck. not only is  &quot;Oops!...i did it again&quot; a great follow up album it contains alot  more dance/pop tracks and show cases britney's maturity as an artist. her  cover of the rolling stones classic &quot;(can't get no)  satisifaction&quot;, is successful mastered, as well as the title track and  the shania twain produced &quot;Don't let me be the last to know&quot;.  Scoring this album a five is only due to the fact that this album is a  great improvement on the debut, and if britney continues delivering effects  like this we will being seening a hell of alot of her in the future.
B000002C1V|5.0|Yes, this is more of a Waters solo record than band effort, but I don't care! This is such a fantastic record!  The vocals are tremendous and the production sublime! If you just know FLOYD from &quot;The Wall&quot;, you  are in for a rare experience with this disc. EVERY track is wonderful and  challenging and overflowing with emotion. One of the best &quot;FLOYD&quot;  records EVER!
B00004T8RK|5.0|this album by pearl jam is just what the music industry needed to give it a good kick in the ass! Binaural begins with a rockin side and ends with a mellowish sonic sound, one of the bands best cd's, this cd can be linked to  there other great work on no code. &quot;light years&quot; and &quot;soon  forget&quot; are two of the many highlights of this album. Other song like  &quot;thin air&quot; and &quot;grievance &quot; show how much pearl jam  have come full circle. Tchad blake has give pearl jam that crisp sound they  needed! Once people realize that limp bizkit is not real music , and that  pearl just aren't that same band they were ten years ago, you can throughly  enjoy this cd.

B000002UAU|5.0|&quot;Strawberry Fields/Penny Lane&quot; was the teaser; innovation, experimentation, exquisite songwriting all present.  During the winter and  spring of 1967 the former Mop Tops recorded an album in which they would  cease to exist, and become another entity altogether.  This is their album.  Sgt. Pepper has been lionised over the last thirty-plus years and the  herald of the summer of love, yet was as much of a reflection as it was a  revelation.  The parties and clubs of swinging London were as much of an  influence on the Beatles as was Bach, the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Ravi  Shankar, and their own youths for this album. HERE THE BEATLES STOPPED  SINGING 'I WANNA BE YOUR MAN' AND STARTED SINGING 'I'D LOVE TO TURN YOU  ON'.  Although not a true concept album, this record does link itself very  well, and does pre- sent a message openly stated on their upcoming  single  &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;.  The message appears to be  &quot;...Nothing you can do that can't be done...&quot;.  Here, the Lonely  Hearts Club Band did  it.  What if they'd put out a cover without their  faces on it, pretending to really be another band? Would the public have  embraced it, and realised  who had really recorded it?  I bet yes to both.  Sgt. Pepper is counted as one of the most influential albums of all time,  yet time and time again is NOT considered as the Beatles all-time best  release.  Listen to and study all their albums to see why people might say  this.  Do you agree, or disagree?  Either way, it's about their coolest  release. CAUTION: DO NOT TAKE DRUGS AND LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM -- YOU MAY  NEVER COME BACK.
B00004T8RK|5.0|What a relief. I didn't think record labels pressed rock n' roll albums anymore. Well trust me, this album is rock. The first two tracks explode from your stereo. It's great! Insignifigance and Grievance are also great  songs. Perhaps the highlight of the album is Eddie Vedder on ukelele! One  warning though: Don't buy this album expecting to hear another Ten. This  album is more in the vein of Yield. But it is not exactly the same, because  once again Pearl Jam proves they can do the evolution.
0345349571|5.0|With painstaking detail and bittersweet humour, Tuchman delves into the history and events surrounding one of the greatest of the French knights.  Enguerrand de Coucy is a knight caught between old and new world orders.   Perhaps the highest example of a crumbling ideal - chivalry - he shows the  fatal flaws in an oppressive system beginning to decay before his birth,  leading to some of the greatest excesses within his lifetime, and finishing  with the fall of the French monarchy in the 18th century.  <br />Parts of  Tuchman's tale are more gripping than an adventure novel, more humourous  than a comedy, and more unbelievable than fiction.  In fact, her story is  so engaging because of its truth.<br />Anyone intersted in the Avignon Papacy,  the Great Schism in the Church, Popes and Antipopes, the Black Plague,  Feudalism, Protestantism, the persecution of witches and sorcery, the  prelude to the Renaissance, Italian banking, Antisemitism, and the Medieval  in general should adore it.  <br />I must admit, my jaw dropped several times  while reading this book, particularly during the chapters focusing on the  schism in the church.  It is not easy to escape the image of a furious Pope  screaming anathema and excommunication from the walls of the Castel  Sant'Angelo upon the beseigers below.  Unbelievable arrogance and  mercilessness seem the hallmark of the times, and Tuchman captures the  essence of these with great alacrity.<br />Following de Coucy lets us  experience life through the attitudes of someone placed firmly in the time.   While many of his attitudes may seem foreign to us, his more modern  qualities allow us to identify, if perhaps not sympathize, with him.<br />I  highly recommend this book both as an introduction to the study of the 14th  century, and as fascinating reading for anyone interested in the human  condition.

0790743523|5.0|A rather difficult movie to classify, (it takes place in 1920, so it's not a classic western which many seem to think) THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE is Hollywood storytelling at it's best. The performances are uniformly  excellent with Huston perhaps giving the best (he won the AA) and our man  Bogie having a great time. Tim Holt was perhaps less an actor than a  presence, but what a presence! Like most of John Huston's films, the movie  deals with a harsh, masculine envirnment and is concerned with men under  pressure. Huston's most remarkable single achievement is that he focuses  all of the symbolic elements as finely as light rays through a magnifying  glass! A classic excursion into men's minds, this film has had many  imitators yet the original has never been duplicated. Both Walter Huston  and John Huston won AA for best supporting actor and director respectively  at the 1949 awards!

B000002UAR|5.0|Following the summer world tour of 1966, the disenchanted Beatles vowed to never tour again. Each took off on holiday, some of them unsure of the future of the band.  Revolver had recently been released, on the heels of  the innovative  single &quot;Paperback Writer/Rain&quot; (which would have  fit nicely in this album).  Revolver remains as perhaps the best Beatles  album ever.  Remember, however, that each successive Beatles album improved  on the last, with two exceptions.  After recording Revolver and finishing  their tour, Sgt. Pepper emerged in the summer of '67.  Revolver hinted at  the psychedelia of the latter album, with &quot;She Said&quot;,  &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, &quot;Love You Too&quot;, &quot;Dr.  Robert&quot;, and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Paul McCartney was fast  becoming the important composer/recording artist that is his legacy with  the Beach Boys-inspired &quot;Here There &amp; Everywhere&quot;, the  poignant &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; and &quot;For No One&quot; and the  slaphappy Mop Top coda of &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;. Each track on this  monumental album boasts of the highest production and arrangements, with  George Martin marshalling his studio instrumentalists to enhance the  songcraft of Lennon/McCartney and Harrison.  George's &quot;Taxman&quot;  opens the album,  showing off his wit and cheek (later realised  again with  &quot;Piggies&quot;, &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; and  solos like &quot;Sue Me Sue You Blues&quot;, &quot;This Song&quot; and  &quot;Soft-Hearted Hannah&quot;).  &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life&quot;  emulates the Motown/Stax sound, and was issued as a single ten years later  (also a major R &amp; B/pop hit for Earth Wind &amp; Fire).  THERE ARE NO  FILLER TRACKS ON THIS ALBUM.  For arrangements, this album is rivalled only  by the diversity of the White Album; for innovation, it is surpassed only  by Sgt. Pepper; for artsiness, it is matched by Rubber Soul; for overall  greatness, it stands next to (and arguably above) Abbey Road.  BUY THIS  ALBUM, AND LISTEN TO IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.ess, it stands next to (and arguably above) Abbey Road.  BUY THIS  ALBUM, AND LISTEN TO IT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
B00004T8RK|5.0|The fact is that pearl jam is a changing band not content with one type of album for their whole musical existance. THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM! and no it's not like their early works...but so what, either has their last three and  your still listening.  Song 2 God's Dice has the power that Hail, Hail had  from the No Code album. Nothing As It Seems has a haunting pink floyd  quality to it and early airplay success to back up the songs quality. Song  7 Insignifigance has a the power of 6 great albums from a band who  represents what true modern rock is. They continue to produce good music  and the critics continue to complain that pearl jam is not once what they  once were. I say they are the band that has always fooled the critics with  amazing success and abundant airplay, and this is the choice of the fans  not critics that seem to live in the past. Pretend that pearl jam is a  brand new band and this is their first release. People would be astounded!  I think thats how Pearl Jam likes it, mix it up a little but still make  great music. Every song on this album is great and soon you will hear a lot  of Binaural over the airways to prove this is a work not to be missed.

B00004SCX6|1.0|Thanks to the wonderful sources of the internet, I was able to listen to the whole cd of Britney Spears sohpmore album a month before it's release date, May 16th. All the songs are nothing but artificial fluff and no depth  whatsoever. Her debut album is SO much better than this one.  Her version  of &quot;I Can't Get No Satisfaction&quot; is an insult to the Rolling  Stones. There isn't anything mature about this album, she's trying to  maintain her audience of youngsters to the adolescent years. &quot;Dear  Diary&quot; is just as cheesy as &quot;Email My Heart.&quot; Her voice  sounds EXACTLY the same as the last album, in which she recorded the songs  when she was 15/16... we all know it's studio enchanced, her real voice is  very raspy and deep. Save some good money and don't buy this album, even if  you DO want to look at those eye catching photographs in the cd case!

I just don't know if have the  knowledge to completely understand all the many complex and intriquing  aspects of this story.  Perhaps it could be due to my age (24) and not  being able to relate to the subject matter in my own way.  None the less, I  can certainly understand the drama, shocking turn of events and emotional  response that others have had to this book.

B00000JJQK|5.0|Much has been written and said about this album, from the high school kid at the record store to Sir Paul McCartney.  Pet Sounds has been deconstructed, dissected, psychoanalysed, plagiarised, and now digitised.  I hope this  package of the album, in both the original mono in a newly  remixed stereo together, becomes the definitive, only release.  Historically, Brian Wilson's creative/commercial apex was reached with this  release.  While the Beach Boys toured, the<br />founder/composer/producer had  retired from the road to hone his craft.  Since that move the Beach Boys  had released Summer Days, Today, and the  fun, lightweight Party album.  The studio albums foreshadowed the coming of a new, more  introspective/symphonic approach, and Pet Sounds was it.  THIS ALBUM MUST  BE LISTENED TO AS A WHOLE PIECE, NOT A COLLECTION OF SINGLES AND FILLER.  Brian Wilson chose a co-lyricist (Tony Asher) who also seems to have  doubled as his therapist.  Pet Sounds' lyrics are heartachingly beautiful  -- about being alone in a crowd, about lost love, about growing up.  The  orchestrations and arrangements are miles beyond the standard  bass/drums/guitars/piano combos found throughout rock &amp; roll music  (only the Beatles were expanding musically as well).  The key changes,  modulations, and time signatures were almost all new for 60s pop, yet the  Beach Boys' label failed to adequately promote the record.  Pet Sounds IS,  as BB frontman Mike Love once said, &quot;Brian's ego music&quot; -- it is  a personal statement, a solo album featuring the incredible vocal prowess  of the Beach Boys.  For the best GROUP statement from the band, see  Sunflower.  Pet Sounds is art, and sometimes art is about pain.  Just think  if &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;That's Not Me&quot; had been  done similar to &quot;Caroline No&quot;, and the hit &quot;Sloop John  B.&quot; had only been released as a single.  Then we would be listening to  a full concept album of teen angst -- a teenage symphony to God.  Yet what  WAS released was a little more commercial than that.  Here it is; Brian  Wilson's STATEMENT.  And true, it is about the greatest through-composed  statement ever done in pop music.a teenage symphony to God.

6300216268|5.0|I have taken it upon myself to see many of the movies that I enjoyed as a young adult in the 60's and 70's.  Some of them I remember as being great, but when I see them again, they're not so great.  One of the truly great  ones is \\"Harold and Maude\\" (1972). The movie has lost nothing for me, and  if anything, is actually better now.  <br />It is the story of a young man  (Harold - Played by Bud Cort) obsessed with death, and his relationship  with an older woman, (Maude- Played by Ruth Gordon)who is a complete free  spirit.  Maude is fond of funerals, but is more fascinated with the circle  of life, not just death.  Their relationship takes Harold on a journey to  maturity that is full of humor and heartache. I was quite pleasantly  surprised recently while I was watching \\"Something about Mary\\" that    \\"Harold and Maude\\" was mentioned a few times as Mary's favorite all time  love story.  <br />This film is the ultimate black comedy. The music is one of  the highlights of this great work.  All of the music is by Cat Stevens. The  music of Cat Stevens also plays through a larger portion of this film that  most of today's soundtracks which may be made more to sell CDs than to  provide mood for the story.  Cat Stevens is also an artist that we can  forget how much we enjoyed.  <br />I showed this video to my sons (12 and 14),  they even appreciated it.  If you want to see a video that gives you a  glimpse of a how we felt about life and death in the 1970's (and how many  of us feel today) see Harold and Maude.  You won't be disappointed.
0385484518|5.0|Before renewing his relationship with his favorite college professor, Mitch Albom was known as one of America's best sportswriters.  &quot;Fab Five&quot; -- his book about the University of Michigan basketball team  that included Chris Weber and Jalen Rose, is the second-best book about  college basketball ever written, second only to John Feinstein's  &quot;Season on the Brink.&quot;  Albom's local Detroit radio show, and his  columns in the pages of the Detroit Free Press (available online at the  paper's website) are among the best in the country.  Yet, it is this  remarkable love story between a busy, frenetic professional (we are all  Mitch Albom, to one degree or another) and a dying philosopher (we will all  end up like Morrie, to one degree or another) that reveals Albom to be more  than just a yuppie sports and radio guy, but a master of the English  language, who can make poetry out of prose, and remind us about what life  is truly all about.  No book in recent memory has been more deserving of  its success.  It is a very short book, so there is no excuse for anyone to  pass it by.

6304119046|1.0|THis is one of the worst movies Ive ever watched. It doesnt matter if it has new camera angles, new techniques. The plot is plain horrible, the narrative is boring, lazy and slow. I cant figure out why the so-called  critics say this is &quot;the best movie of all times&quot; ! They must be  joking! The dialogues are terrible, acting is poor, image is old.I prefer  Chaplin !
B00003CWOL|3.0|Hard to decribe this movie. It seems to have a serious point to make about religion: at lot of the dialogue appears to be diatribe rather than interaction. But it is all wrapped up in a bizarre story line and some  pretty wierd characters. The best way I can describe it as modern  Shakespeare which I suppose is one hell of a complement to Kevin  Smith.<br />The story is about two angels cast out of heaven (played by Matt  Damon and Ben Affleck) who have found a loophole that allows them to  return. However, if they do, it will be the end of the World. This is all a  set up by another angel, Azrael (played by Jason Lee) who wants the world  to end because he has been cast into hell. The only person who can save the  world is a Scion played by Linda Fiorentina (who I do not think does a  confused character as well as she does a manipulative one).<br />Of course  there is lots more, a campy Alan Rickman, Chris Rock (almost playing  himself) as the 13th apostle (removed from the bible because he is black)  and Salma Hayek (gorgeous as ever)together with Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith  reprising their roles as Jay and Silent Bob.<br />What you get is an uneven  mish mash. When it is good, it is brilliant, but Smith's quirky style  unfortunately sometime detracts rather than adds to the story as it most  certainly did in Clerks. <br />You are best making your own mind up and  contemplating Alanis Morrisette as God. Watch it and see what you think.

B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney's latest CD is great. While the title track sounds very similar to Baby One More Time it has it's own form of groovyness. As her sophmore track one can definately tell that she is maturing. The songs have a  sharper edge and will appeal to older listeners as well as her young fans.  My personal favoriets are STRONGER, WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET and LUCKY.  Each has it it's own form of cutting edge sound.  STRONGER reminds me of  something that Modonaa would sing.  WHERE ARE YOU NOW is a sort of ballad  that touches the soul and speaks for many peoples hearts. CAN'T MAKE YOU  LOVE ME is very similar to NSYNC's Bye Bye Bye. WHEN YOUR EYES SAY IT  reminds me of Michael Jackson's soundtrack to Free Willy. Dear Diary is  beuatiful ballad that can easily compete with Maria's greatest love songs.  The sound of this CD could be considered super hits meets greatest hits.  Britney has brought pop into the new millinium by borrowing sounds from  some of the greatest songs of the past and makeing them new. Her own. I  don't see how anyone can go wrong with this CD and I am sure that anyone  who buys it will be completely satisfied with it. I would definately  recommend it.
0140288503|5.0|to read this book is to learn of the actions of the greatest warriors to ever walk the earth. this is a story of the united states army airborne rangers as they are droped into what was suposed to be an easy mission in a  poorly equiped third world country. the rangers thought they would be  facing nothing more than a local milita but what awaited them on that day  was a city the size of new york, and those not firing on them with ak-47s  where willingly using themselves as human shields. this is a rare look into  the best light infantry unit in the world. in this book you will move  through the streets of this urban jungle with true american heros as they  battle to complete a mission gone terribly wrong. your heart will become  auidible as the men to your flanks take rounds to the chest and continue  the fight. read BLACK HAWK DOWN and find out what the rangers mean when  they say... READILY WILL I DISPLAY THE INTESTINAL FORTITUDE REQUIRED TO  FIGHT ON TO THE RANGER OBJECTIVE AND COMPLETE THE MISSION THOUGH I BE THE  LONE SURVIVOR
6305728437|4.0|Very good. A strong plot, a inspired Eddie Murphy as the Dargons voice, very few of that typical lousy songs of Disneys movies, good characters, plausible ending. The best!
6302256615|4.0|The plot revolves around an undercover FBI agent who infiltrates a group of surgers and skydivers believed to be responsible for a series of bank robberies. The film contains some attractive locales, a great deal of  masculine posturing, some fast-paced action and one hair-raising,  unforgettable foot-chase sequence. The use of a hand-held camera (which  reflects the unrest and tension of the situations and characters) creates a  suitably gritty effect. Smartly directed, it is also enlivened by a touch  of humour (the robbers enter every bank wearing the masks of Presidents;  one robber, brandishing a gun, exits the bank and cries out at the cowering  hostages, &quot;Don't forget to vote!&quot;)
B00004SCX6|5.0|Her new album is quite simply fantabulous. If you liked the first, this one's for you. If you didn't, it's still highly recommended. Oops I Did It  Again really shows how much Miss Spears has matured and really expresses  how she feels about her newfound fame. In many a song, I couldn't help but  sense that she was singing about herself. Mature is the word. Her  loneliness ain't killing her no more.<br />A few notable songs in this album  are Oops I Did It Again, Stronger, Satisfaction, What U See Is What U Get,  Lucky, Girl In The Mirror and Dear Diary. Lucky is indeed implicit of how  empty she feels deep inside despite her monumental success. The upbeat  rhythm really disguises the sorrow the protagonist, Lucky, is going  through. A classic!<br />Buy the album, you won't regret it. It does not sound  the same throughout, it's tunes are much more diverse than her previous  flick. There are more guranteed #1 hits too. It's bigger, it's better. Get  it now.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauren Hill sings her songs with feeling that is close to being unmatched in the music world.  She has matured from her early days in the Fugees to emerge as one of the top performers of our time.  The song &quot;To  Zion&quot; is amazing in its lyrical content and that fantastic music.  A  must have for fans of Hip Hop, R&amp;B, and Rap
B000009ED0|5.0|Kid Rock is the bom I hope to hear more from him.
B000001FQI|5.0|This is Tears For Fears third album.  It is quite a departure from their first two albums, which were typical, but better than average, new wave pop from the early eighties.  This album has a much more mature, rich and  complex sound.  It mixes soul, pop, jazz and straight ahead rock with bits  of psychodelia thrown in.  <br />For this album, the duo actually expands to a  trio with the addition of Oleta Adams.  She adds just as much to the sound  as Orzabal and Smith.  Her song writing, singing and keyboard playing are  phenomenal.  <br />Many critics and fans complained that it took too long for  this third album to come out, and that it sounded too much like the  Beatles.  In concert, Curt Smith would introduce Sowing the Seeds of Love,  with &quot;It took us 4 years to make a new album and all we could come up  with is this&quot;.  After the song, they would break into All You Need Is  Love. <br />This is one of those albums where every track is fantastic, except  one.  Advice for the Young At Heart is a horrible, sappy song.  Alot of  people consider the break up Smith and Orzabal as the reason for the band  to drop off in popularity.  But, it was ill considered decision to release  Advice For The Young At Heart as the second single from this album that  caused the band to drop out of the limelight.  When the single was  released, album sales dropped like a rock.  It's unfortunate that this  songs sits in the track 4 position, and interrupts the flow of the album.   <br />Note, the track order listed here is incorrect.
6300214826|5.0|It puts &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; and &quot;Platoon&quot; in the shade. This is easily the best Vietnam film and the greatest war film ever. It topically transfers the setting of Joseph Conrad's epic novella  &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; from the Congo to Vietnam, although it leaves  the story, themes and characters relatively intact. Marlon Brando offers an  intimidating and overpowering performance. The impact he exerts in the film  is profound, even though his face remains in shadow for the most of the  duration of his appearance. A classic of the now outdated genre of Vietnam  films.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is so great, that I don't know where or how to start. I'm sure you already know the story by reading other people's comments, but I would just like to imphasize on it.  This movie was so breathtaking that I have  loved it ever since I saw it in Japan in 1997. I loved it, and now I love  it even more. In fact it wasn't just great entertainment but very  inspirational on the conflicts between man and nature, war and destruction  and love. I HIGHLY recomend it to any nature lover(such as myself),  animation fan or anyone.   If you think all anime are the &quot;same&quot;,  think again. This may have some blood and violence, but thats what the  story is about. You cant block all the bad stuff out from the world,like  Miyazaki said. <br />    This is surely a great work of Miyazaki and I hope  many people will watch it and learn from it.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This CD is amazing.  Santana has combined so many different types of music to make an amazing record.  The songs contribute to the overall great record and there is not one song that is bad.  All the songs are so good  and this is one CD you'll play right through many times.  The featured  artists are all great in their songs and I would recommend this to anyone.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Interesting initial listen and like &quot;No Code&quot; will probably take  several re-visits to fully apprieciate.<br />&quot;Thin Air&quot; is a  fantastic track of &quot;Off he Goes &quot; quality.<br />The close of the  album features a song with EV solo - Fantastic<br />&quot;Nothing as it  seams&quot; is a far better performance than the Bridge School recording  and &quot;Breakerfall&quot; is a punky old-style rock number.<br />Other  higlights include &quot;Rival&quot; probably the best track on the album
0783241542|4.0|A hilarious but rather predictable coming-of-age movie. The theme has been exhausted by countless predecessors. The ending can be spotted from as early as the first twenty minutes. The jokes and situations, though, are  extremely funny and the movie is altogether an amusing and uplifting  account of a universal situation - adolescent angst and sex-deprivation.
6305903182|5.0|Scream 3 is a ton of fun!  Wes Craven rules.  Scott Foley is a hottie even when he is kinda dorky.  Jay and Silent Bob have a short but adorable cameo.  Every horrer movie fanatic should see this movie.  Wes Craven is  the King of Scream.
0788805843|1.0|Hey you, guys who swallow anything Disney push into your throats: I have one thing to say: this is their worst aniamted film ever!  It destroyed Greek Mythology, it made Hercules look like a dumb person, it has the worst  technical effort ever, all characters are horrible. If you don't wanna see  that, fine with me. But just compare it with &quot;MULAN&quot;, &quot;LION  KING&quot; and all others...
B00004SCX6|5.0|To Everyone, I am tellin' u now go out and bye britney's new album i live in australia so we get 3 extra tracks but u will do yourself a favour if u  bye this my fave songs are &quot;Heart&quot;(australian  only)&quot;Lucky&quot; &quot;Don't go knockin' on my door&quot; &quot;Dear  Diary&quot; and &quot;What u see(is what u get)&quot;But all the songs rock  so go on and order brit's album.
B00000DGSN|5.0|this life album is very commercial, but it doesnt matter! why? the answer is easy, because this album has been a powerfull album in the rock n roll history. Deep Purple is the best HARD rock band in this planet...   This  album is much much better than any other Rock bands life albums,....forget  Bob Seger, forget Led Zeppelin,....DEEP PURPLE long live!
6305903182|5.0|Scream 3 is a ton of fun!  Wes Craven rules.  Scott Foley is a hottie even when he is kinda dorky.  Jay and Silent Bob have a short but adorable cameo.  Every horrer movie fanatic should see this movie.  Wes Craven is  the King of Scream.
B00003OSSM|1.0|I'm not disppointed because Ford did this movie and I only'like him as an action charcter. No way. I'm disppointed simply because the movie has a bad screenplay, that left Ford and THomas totally without control of their  lousy characters, with no life at all. Bad motion picture. Don't recommend  it to anyone.
0385334206|5.0|Vonnegut has the ability to dig up society's most disturbing attributes and make us laugh them in the face. Breakfast of Champions is no exception to this rule. The story revolves around an unappreciated author and the man  who takes one of his works a bit too seriously. Going any farther would  ruin it so i'll stop. Overall a great book and it's illustrated too!  If  you like Vonnegut this will reaffirm that liking, if you've never read him  before this will make you a believer. I also recommend by Vonnegut:  Slaughterhouse-5, and if you have some time to kill, Mother Night.
B000002HRE|5.0|This is the album that got me hooked.  This is also, in my opinion, the best album ever.  With songs like Devils Dance, Fuel, and Low Man's Lyric, this is the greatest.  If you are a Metallica fan, or want to become a  Metallica fan, this is the one to buy.
B000002L5I|5.0|This is definitely one of the best cd's I own.  Ever since I saw KWS live twice in about as many months, I've been hooked.  This cd has everything... rocking songs like Slow Ride and bluesy songs like Somehow, Somewhere,  Someway.  And every song is a winner.
630575067X|2.0|George Lucas is a marketing genius. He build a fanastic climax to a history that is, at his best, a simple one. Full of special effects, there are several unforgivable flaws: 1) the movie is clearly made for everyone  from ages 9 to 80. No deaths, nothing politically &quot;Incorrect&quot;; 2)  Jar Jar Binks is disgusting; 3) THe boy who plays young Anakin is as bad as  actor as he can be. I don't understand how he was cast.
B000001E7L|5.0|If you are a Cranberries fan, like I am you are going to worship this CD. Each and every song is worth listening to a million times. From the powerful &quot;Zombie&quot; to the melodious &quot;ode to my family, Twenty  One&quot; and &quot;Dreaming My Dreams&quot;. Its an absolute must  have.Trust me, you won't tegret it.
0440234743|4.0|The Testament follows Grisham's usual archetype.  The book offers the usual characters: lawyers at a big law firm, wealthy clients, and is set mainly in Washington DC.  <br />This aside, the book has some redeeming  qualities.  In many ways is more a look at human nature.  Different  characters want to protect their different interests, and all of the  viewpoints are explored, from the rich to the poorer to the Christian  outlook.<br />Nate, the main character, goes on a &quot;wild&quot; adventure  in the Patanal, the most ecologically-rich region in the world.  The fact  that almost half of the novel is set in Brasil is wonderful.  Too few books  include settings outside the United States.  The description of the Patanal  leaves a bit to be desired, because it comes across as a swampy rainforest  that is extremely dangerous.  In some ways that is true, but the Patanal is  full of ecodiversity that the book cannot capture.  However, for the  purpose of the book, it is easy to tell that Grisham has real life  experience in the region.  He is thus connected to the book geographically.   He connects Nate's life to the adventure through the Patanal, which gives  the book a more literary feel.<br />Overall, this book reaches beyond  Grisham's other novels and places the reader into the 11 billion dollar  dispute while simultaneously exploring a fascinating site in Latin America.   It is a quick read that will keep the reader's attention.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops she did WHAT again?...Let him hit her one MORE time?...and she did so because she...likes it that way?  Skip this little bit o' pop-vomit and get your self a good ole' Talking Heads record!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I wouldnt call myself a pop music fan in anymeans, but for some reason I decided to buy Oops!...I Did It Again (i was infact coming to the store to buy the new Pearl Jam cd).  I was extremely surprised at Britneys awesome  songs &amp; the cool music on the cd! This is a MUST HAVE if you like ANY  TYPE OF MUSIC!
B000006OS2|1.0|McLintock is one of my favorite John Wayne movies.  It is a wonderful tale done by a great group of actors.  The sad day comment is based on the totally pathetic quality of the DVD.  To put is very simply it stinks.  Not  only is it not in widescreen it appears the film they copied it from was  dragged around the parking lot for half an hour then danced on by a herd of  elephants.   I will stick to the VHS version of this movie until someone  who is not out for a quick buck puts out a credible copy of this fine film.   Save your money.   I would have given this insult to John Waynes memory no  stars but the system required that I give it at least one. So that is what  it got.
0060931671|5.0|...although that's still not very accessible. But this book is worth the trouble of grappling with the author's obscure allusions, open-ended questions, and maddening mixture of the deadly serious and the utterly  nonsensical. Still, compared to his massive tomes GRAVITY'S RAINBOW and V.,  for instance, the general outline of CRYING OF LOT 49 is relatively  comprehensible. Oedipa Maas, a confused child of the sixties, stumbles upon  what may or may not be a centuries-old conpiracy as a result of being named  &quot;executrix&quot; of her wealthy, eccentric former lover's estate. The  sinister, fascinating glimpses of the &quot;tristero&quot; that  increasingly obsess her may be genuine insights into a real but previously  hidden reality, an indication of her descent into paranioa and madness, or  a colossal practical joke. She has no way of determining which, and neither  do we. On some levels this is frustrating, but Pynchon's hilarious,  eccentric, beautiful prose and the original, fascinating plotline keep your  interest, and certainly satisfied me, at least. His irreverant takes on the  superficiality of both the counterculture and suburban America, the  banality of bad Jacobean revenge melodramas, and the illogic of scientists,  historians, and almost everyone else continue to delight me on rereadings.  It may not be as great an achievement as his longer masterworks, but I  would rather read this more enjoyable and accessible (although still  profound and troubling) little book anyday.
B00004SCX6|5.0|this is the best album ever. The songs are a lot more funky on this album, some are  even R&amp;B like What U see is what u get. If you think Oops I Did It Again just wait until you here Stronger, Knockin on My door,  Satisfaction, and What U See Is What U Get!This is definately 10 times  better than Britney's debut album, Baby One More Time! I currently own 14  different britney CD's and this tops them all! Any one that remotely like  Britney has to get this. You will not be dissapointed! Buy it no!
B00004T8RK|3.0|Peral Jam is still evolving its soud with Binaural.  It isn't Vs or Ten, but it is more intimate like yield.  There are some heavier songs...ten like..., but all in all they are mellower.  It has taken me a few spins to  try and get used to their post Neil Young era.  The disc is an experience,  not aout one individual song.  Keep that in mind, but make sure you add  this disc to your collection if you are a true fan.
0679777547|5.0|An amazing book.  It is one of few books I have read that successfully combines action and high art.  It is very entertaining but not disposable.  Given all of the information on manuscrict forgery etc. the book moves  along quickly, is always entertaining, is written with wit and grace and  never degenerates into purposely esoteric dry intellectualism.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I know that Britney is a nice girl. I've seen her on tv premiering this cd. It's a shame, but there is nothing here that merits a listen, unless you are a fan. For the teenager the fantasy may be enough, for the music  listener, it's not anything to write home about. This cd will sell  millions, but I will never know why! You may be a fan, if you are discount  this review, as nothing will pursuade you from the fact that this formula  fodder for the masses!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Now, not being a Britney fan, i was reluctant to buy her 2nd album-Ooops I Did It Again.  I was surprised when i found out how great it is.  This album is better than the first! !  There is a great selection of new music  which will surprise you all!  Her rendition of the Stone's  &quot;Satisfaction&quot; was awesome and is sure to be a hit.  Also  &quot;Don't Go Knockin On My Door&quot; has a great R&amp;B sound to it.   Other favorites include &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Oops!&quot; And  &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;  This is a great follow-up to  her first album and is definitely better.  Oops!  She Did It Again ! ! !

B00004T8RK|4.0|this is such a good albulm.  lyricaly, its one of their strongest.  i've only had it for a day and have listened to it 3 times through already, cant get enough of it.  still, i have feeling people wont agree.  pearl jam's  last three albulms are like independent films, nobody will see it but you  cant deny its strength.  its not mainstream sounding rock, so it wont sell.   but thats what makes pearl jam my favorite band.  they go for the sounds  they like, not for what MTV wants.  true pearl jam fans will love this.  i  cant wait to hear some of these songs in concert.  especially &quot;light  years&quot; and &quot;isignificance&quot;.  &quot;grievance&quot; is also  one of my favorites.  Yeild still stands as my favorite PJ albulm, but  Binaural is another classic!  &quot;and i know she's reached my heart&quot;
B00000I8BX|4.0|A trend of Roadrunner Records is to glorify and commercialize any band that they see potential to (i.e. Slipknot and Coal Chamber). This cd is another attempt by this record label to &quot;sell out&quot; what is  considered to be good talent, even scoring a video on MTV air time. With  that said, Fear Factory has done an excellent job once again. The cd,  unlike the previous two studio albums, goes for a more softer, melodic edge  to it, as seen in the songs Descent and Resurrection. While it will never  accomplish the righteousness of Soul of a New Machine or Demanufacture,  fans will still enjoy listening to this work. My only fear is watching the  band change themselves for the benefit of profit, and not the music.
0393314804|5.0|I finished Trainspotting five minutes ago and it was a heartache to close the book after having absorbed so many emotions from it. I searched for it because I had heard only a little about it with the exception of a few  famous people reading it. Due to my vanity, I had to read it. A friend  bought it for me and as soon as I started, I was blown away by the dialect  and slang used. Once I got over the initial intimidation, I dove headfirst  into an incredible book. Although this isn't my usual read, (I'm a huge W.  Gibson fan), I found myself absolutely captivated by Welsh's characters. I  think of him as a fabulous storyteller who captured the epitome of the  tragedy of being young. I applaud him for showing that we do indeed have  remorse for what we do. But we also have a love/hate relationship for this  world. Read Trainspotting. It was indescribably beautiful.
B000002J1H|5.0|This album really illustrates the literal meaning of progressive rock to me. Yes could not have made GOING FOR THE ONE without starting at THE YES ALBUM (1971) and going through RELAYER (1974). And like anything that  progresses, one has to reach a ceiling. Musically, the band created the  best music of its career, even surpassing CLOSE TO THE EDGE in my view.  &quot;Awaken&quot; is a piece that nearly attains that fabled &quot;lost  chord&quot; with its exhiliarating ascension. It actually, musically and  lyrically, beats &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; at its own game. Even the  album's one hit single &quot;Wonderous Stories&quot; is powerful. Why  &quot;classic-rock radio&quot; doesn't play this song more and spare us yet  another re-run of &quot;Roundabout&quot; (the editted version) and  &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; is a mystery. Every song on this album  is fantastic. No filler. Not a clinker in the lot. Pity the album came at a  time when the punks were whining, and the critics were eating out of their  hands, it would have been a major hit.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I surprisingly liked this CD. I have to say that Britney has grown as a artist, and this CD, is a lot better than her first one. She has a lot of songs that you can dance too, and some nice ballads as well. The only songs  that I didn't like were &quot;Don't Go Knockin' On My Door,&quot; and  &quot;Lucky.&quot; Overall I would recommend this CD, to anyone who likes  Pop music.
6305810109|5.0|Alot of people thought that just because this Lynch gem isn't twisted meant that it wasn't good. Actually, it is more enjoyable because of it's mainstream plot (no offense to Twin Peaks, I have a place in my heart for  you to). Richard Farnsworth (Oscar nomination well deserved) portrays Alvin  Straight, a man who travels on his lawnmower to visit his sick brother. It  is funny, adventurous, and highly dramatic. But it's the little things  (Alvin picks up his hat) that brings on the tears.
B0000065TL|4.0|In my opinion this is one of the best documentaries I have everseen. Outstanding because it's different from a regular one since it'sa Madonna documentary. Its style is so cured, and it looks great. Leaving out the question if it's the complete real life we see here, it's very interesting to see what exactly goes on behind the scenes of a big-scale world tour (of Madonna nonetheless), footage of mis-performances caused by bad weather or technicalities, preparations and what the people do before and after these shows. They have lots of fun, work hard, fool around... Madonna behaves very naughty and uses the 'f' word a whole lot. Keep in mind to be in and create this kind of shows must keep her (all) under a lot of strees, so the behavior of everyone involved is not automatically their regular. The live performances in color look awesome as well as the sound! In particular the performance of 'Express Yourself' here is amazing, though I doubt in real life the sound and picture quality was the same, beacuse if you had the chance to see the (Grammy-winning) taping on laser disc of the 'Blond Ambition Tour' it looks very different (even when you keep in mind no performance is the same); I also think the redention of 'Like a Virgin' in a mid-orient style is great, it gives me the chills right from the start and is absolutely fabulous. The sleeve of the tape I bought in NY in 1996 says there are new performances of 'Like A Prayer' and 'Hanky Panky', but there is none! And to make it even worse, it was recorded in EP! (Why do they use it for original recordings is beyond me). Thank God I already had an english tape and the quality is perfect. The whole movie is great and the use of the music in the background while things happen (improvised press conferences...) is too. Like when she goes to her mother's grave and lies next to her you hear 'Promise to Try' and it makes me so sad (for her too-she lost her mother when she was very young). So what if she behaves like she does?The meaning of life is not of go to work, then go home and go to sleep, she has fun and a great time and she deserves it, we all do. Life is too short and if she decides to live it that way I'm happy for her. I love this movie!
0812931017|5.0|This was an excellent book! It was a fast reader and made me realize that Virgin didn't just pop-up over night and become succesful right away. After reading this, I swore never to fly British Airways- what they did was  awful- but interesting that I didn't want to put the book down. A must for  Virgin fans like my self! Way to Go Mr. Branson!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Well what can I say! BRITNEY DID IT AGAIN!  Great upbeat songs, typical britney beats and all. Slow songs: nice, VERY nice!
0783222475|5.0|This movie is a classic adventure movie. The tension builds throughout, as Brosnan attempts to raise the warning about the volcano. Of course you know he will be right, but the movie gives a plausible reason for the poeple's  resistance. Also, Linda Hamilton does a great job as the mayor who is torn  between believing him and keeping the town from economic ruin. It's not as  predictable as most adventure flicks either. The last 45 minutes totally  kept me on the edge of my seat. Loved this one.
B000002KON|5.0|I will skip the babbling about how great The Kinks are. Here is the order in which I recommend buying their albums:<br />1. Something Else By The Kinks (5 stars)<br />2. Face to Face (5 stars)<br />3. Village Green  Preservation Society (5 stars)<br />4. Arthur... (5 stars)<br />5. Lola  Versus Powerman &amp; The Moneygoround (4.5 stars)<br />6. Misfits (4  stars)<br />7. Muswell Hillbillies (4 stars)<br />The first five are  masterpieces. &quot;Something Else&quot; and &quot;Village Green&quot; are  cohesive ensemble pieces; &quot;Face to Face&quot; is a fabulous collection  of songs. Note that this is not a ranking; this is just the order in which  I recommend buying these gems.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney's back with her new album, and she really has done it again.  This is a corking new album, a great follow up to her debut 'Baby one more time' its full of soaring pop harmonies, bad girl attitude, aching Mariah carey  vocals, and a stomping beat, from this album you can tell she really isn't  that innocent.  With her first attempt at a little r'n'b it shows a  promisin' career in this line in music. The remix of the rolling stones  classic, is subtle yet sexy, in a britney way. If you thought baby one more  time was a classic album, then this one will suprise you even more, it's a  great album, that unlike her debut doesn't get weaker as the album goes on.  I really recommend this album, it's fun, summery, and best of all very  britney.
B00003ZA0T|5.0|Slipknot is the best. I haven't heard the inport cd but I have heard me inside and I think it is the greatest song in the world. If you don't have any of the slipknot cd's you need to go out and buy one, i promise you will  not be disapointed at all. Buy it NOW.
0440234743|5.0|Grisham's basic premise, though not particularly imaginative, is more than effective.  The first few chapters of this novel grabbed me and refused to let go.  The selfish greed portrayed by the spoiled children of the  deceased had me hoping for justice; the contrasting selflessness portrayed  by the long-lost daughter had me cheering for the ideals and ethics of her  missionary lifestyle.  Grisham juggles his subplots so efficiently that I  was never afraid something would be dropped.  If anything, he puts on such  a splendid show in the first half of the book, that he was hard-pressed to  follow his own act in the second half.  I appreciated his sensitive and  faithful rendering of the missionary's viewpoints, preaching against the  greed of our age without, uh, well...preaching at us.  That's a 'testament'  to Grisham's true talent: moralizing while entertaining.  What a juggler!
0694003611|5.0|This is my two year old son's favorite book next to 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar'.  It is a sweet little rhyming poem that he is now starting to say along with me.  When he was younger, he would just point to things when  I would say them.  Later as he learned to speak, he began to identify them  and call out their names.  Now as I read, he finishes the sentences.<br />This  book is simple and elegant. I never tire of reading it to him, nor does he  run out of enthusiasm for it.  Long after he forgets this book, I'll  remember the joy on his face as I read him 'Goodnight Moon'.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I play this CD at my espresso booth--I'm the owner, so I can play what I like--and I can see the immediate look of judgment that flits through some customers' eyes...as if to say, &quot;Oh, that loud music full of anger and  noise.&quot;  Alas, the same people would probably tap their toes to  Britney Spears.  Enough said about that.  These guys rock!  And they have  something to say!  What a combination.  They express their hope in their  fifth song: &quot;I hope I helped you live.&quot;  And they succeed.  By  posing life questions in powerful music and lyrics, Creed challenges me to  look beyond my immediate surroundings and remember there are bigger issues  than my own little world.  Yes, they make me feel young again in songs like  &quot;Never Die,&quot; but they also speak of moving beyond abuse,  accepting parenthood responsibly, and looking forward to that peace  &quot;Inside Us All,&quot; that can take us &quot;to the place with golden  streets.&quot;  Creed plants itself strongly in the subconscious and  demands, reasons, and pleads, that we step from the wide path to death and  choose the straight and narrow.
0399213015|5.0|This has been my two year old son's favorite book for about the last six months.  He wants me to read it again and again.  He is now learning to count and with each of the fruits he counts them out loud...1,2,3,4,5  oranges.  And he always gets excited when we come to the part about the  butterfly!<br />This is a must-have for kids one to three years old.
B000002OZY|5.0|Looking for quality rock music and a capturing story?  Then Tommy is for you.  It is in my opinion the best thing to come out of the sixties (I'm a seventies man, myself).  With great songs like Overture, Amazing Journey,  Eyesight to the Blind, Cousin Kevin, Acid Queen, Underture, Pinball Wizard,  Sensation, I'm Free, and We're Not Gonna Take It, it's a mesmerizing album.   The story is great too.  Townshend's lyric writing is great (but he's no  Roger Waters).  It is a tale of &quot;murder, trauma, bullying, child  molestation, sex, drugs, illusion, delusion, altered consciousness,  spiritual awakening, religon, charlatanism, success,superstardom, faith,  betrayal, rejection, and pinball.&quot;  That was quoting Richard Barnes'  &quot;Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Boy.&quot;  Roger Daltrey's singing is awesome  and Townshend, Entwistle, and Moon's music is good too.  There's not one  bad song on this album and I can't stop listening to it.  If you liked The  Wall by Pink Floyd (the greatest band of all time) then you'll like this.   They deal with the same issues and are both concept albums which I love.   I'm tired of songs about nothing.  Tommy and The Wall have good plots and  different kinds of music but they both have songs you can nod your head to.   But The Wall is my favorite because of its more emotional impact.  Pink  Floyd can make you cry.  The Who and Led Zeppelin aren't bad either.  Take  my advice, by Tommy.  Buy The Wall too.  You won't regret it.  Trust me.
6305810109|5.0|Richard Farnsworth has been acting 63 years.  That's a long time as a supporting and character actor.  He gets his big opportunity to be a leading man at age 79 and he nails it.  Farnsworth plays Alvin Straight who  takes a cross country odyssey on a riding mower to see his ailing brother  with whom he has not spoken in ten years.<br />This is a warm and touching  story that takes its time unfolding.  Alvin's journey is a journey for the  viewer as well. It is an excellent character study of a proud and  cantankerous old man who is determined to cling to his self sufficiency and  dignity and for whom failure is not an option.  It reminds us that behind  the eyes of those old faces that we so often push aside, there are real  people with strong principles, wisdom, experience and emotions worth far  more than the value we place on them.<br />Director David Lynch is to be  commended for transcending his own usually bizarre mold in this film.   Though his pacing is decidedly slow, so is the lawnmower, so it is  appropriate.  The prelude to Alvin's getting on the road was particularly  deliberate and might have been condensed a bit, but once on the road the  pacing was perfectly adapted to the story.  The locations were terrific,  with numerous aerial shots of our beautiful heartland.  The story was  presented with sensitivity and simplicity without a lot of visual  gimmickry.  It's good to see a film where the story and not the filmmaking  is the point.<br />Farnsworth gives the performance of his career.  His  portrayal makes Alvin determined and stubborn, but in a way that is lovable  and charismatic.  His ability to distill complex emotions into simple  expressions was masterful.<br />My only real criticism was that Sissy Spacek  gave what I thought was a sub-par performance for her.  I thought she  overdid the speech impediment to the point where it hindered the  dialogue.<br />This is an absorbing and wonderful human interest story.  I  rated it a 9/10.  For thoselooking for fast paced action, this is not your  movie.  For everyone else, see it soon and enjoy its simple enchantment.
0440219078|5.0|I think after reading this book I had a whole new look on things. I really liked this book. A person can feel like an outcast all there life but in the end God or a higher power has a plan for you to fallow.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Having been quite excited about the release of this cd, I ran out to purchase it this morning. After the first listen, it has met my excitement. Pearl Jam has grown into an incredibly solid band, one that displays fine  musicianship, an incredible range of vocals, and wonderful song writing.  Upon my first listen, the tracks that caught my ear were heavier  &quot;god's dice&quot; and &quot;insignificance.&quot; They evoke memories  of the band's past, when they belted out anthems left and right. The music  is powerful, and Vedder's voice equally strong. In addition to the more  bombastic tracks, the disc includes a variety of mid-tempo songs. The  strongest, again after one listen, were &quot;light years&quot; and the  mandolin-driven &quot;soon forget.&quot; The latter of the two seems to be  another sign of the band moving into new arenas of music, with the stark  beauty of the song capturing my attention more than any other on the disc.  So please, if you are looking for a wonderful cd, and are willing to accept  the fact that bands, like the rest of us, have to evolve to stay together,  make the purchase and enjoy
0920668372|5.0|I have read this book all my life. My mom read it to me when i was little and i now read it to my niece when she stays over. This book has touched my life and changed me forever. I cry every time i read this book. I recomend  it to anyone and everyone. All ages love it and the older you get the more  you like it, I promise. So please read it and read it to your children. It  will change their life for the better.

6305265488|5.0|What more could you ask for, a love story, that has been told for years.  But now, not only does the heroine get her man, but she has a strength that shows that no matter what the circumstances are, you can overcome anything  if love is there.  Drew Barrymore plays the part of our beautiful heroine  with a great passion and deserves any credit that is due.
B0000039QA|5.0|I liked the cd because the music on it was cool to listen to.
B00002MZ2C|1.0|The ultimate &quot;sell-out&quot; band is Rage Against the Machine.  While simultaneously protesting capitalism, corporate &quot;greed&quot;, and &quot;big business&quot; they are laughing all the way to the bank by  selling their records in the capitalist marketplace, getting their checks  from a &quot;greedy&quot; corporation, and they work for an industry that  epitomizes the worst of all business practices.  Like Chuck D said  &quot;Don't Believe the Hype&quot;, these people do not practice what they  preach.
B000002NHN|3.0|Of the Loreena McKennitt CDs I've reviewed on this website to date, this is my least favorite. Her voice remains one of the most beautiful I've heard. However, though her work is of the \\"celtic\\" genre, several of the  selections on \\"The Book of Secrets\\" sound more Middle Eastern to my  unrefined ears. This is fine, of course, if one is having a meal in a kebab  house, but not when I'm expecting something with a more Irish or Scottish  flavor. I mean, I know the Celts lived outside of Ireland and Scotland, but  I can't picture them in Damascus, Jerusalem, Beirut or Cairo. Conversely,  maybe it is celtic, am I'm just too dumb to know it.<br />There are still two  tracks on this CD that are quite marvelous, and cause me to give the whole  a marginal thumbs up. The first, \\"The Highwayman\\", is the poem of the same  name by Alfred Noyes put to Loreena's song. As a teenager in high school  afflicted with the obligatory class on English poetry, I was fascinated  with the vision conjured up by the words: \\"The wind was a torrent of  darkness among the gusty trees. The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon  the cloudy seas. The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor.  And the highwayman came riding, riding, riding. The highwayman came riding,  up to the old inn-door.\\" Then, of course, there's the bit concerning the  landlord's black-eyed daughter with the dark red love knot in her long  black hair. Must have had something to do with raging hormones. In any  case, this rendition of the poem is wonderful.<br />The second notable track  is the last, \\"Dante's Prayer\\", a soft and soulful tribute to love's  remembrance. Oh, so beautiful.
157492589X|5.0|I love Lonesome Dove,and I think this is Duvall and Jones best work.It's probably the best western ever made.Duvall does Augustus wonderfully,as Jones does Captain Call very well.Follows the book closely,which makes it  better.Too bad there aren't more than 5 stars.Buy this movie,it's  wonderful!
0440133688|1.0|I found the book ponderous and dull.  The author's observations about the medical profession became progressively less interesting as he repeated them again and again.  Despite Updike's praise, the flights of lyrical  fancy were embarassing.  The sex seemed tacked on and the humor fell flat  for me (particularly the irritating dialogue between the docs and the  cops).  The book's main value may be to dispel readers' illusions about the  medical field, as well as illusions about the pre-managed care era with its  incentives for overutilization of tests, etc.  Yes, the author intended to  illustrate the monotony of a young physician's life, but when someone can  do this AND write an interesting book, I'll give it some more stars.
B00004SCX6|3.0|This CD was not that bad. I mean- most of the songs still have that *crazy* and *from the bottom of my broken heart* sound, but if you like self expression on problems we all face up to and those guy problems that just wont go away and ya like britany than by all means get this cute cd!
B000002U82|5.0|This is a classic release. It deserves it's reputation as one of the all-time greats. It rules in sound, content, and emotion. I can't believe there are people here that don't appreciate what are the best lyrics on any  Rock release to date! I guess they just don't get it. Live a few more  years, listen again, and if you still don't get it, you haven't learned a  thing.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I refused to buy this CD until I heard Fiona in concert this past April.  I admit, I did not want to fall victim to the hype.  I get so tired of artists falling into the sophomore slumps, and I get tired of wasting my  money on not-so-good follow up albums.  Not so with Fiona!     She is one  of the most unique performers I have ever seen.  Never in my life have I  seen a performer get on the stage, mesh with a piano, hack and cough and  scream, spray her mouth with cough stuff, hack and cough some more, and  STILL sound better in person.  Inconceivable!  I was impressed, hell, I was  in awe.  She did not crack, she did not waver.  Fiona was...exceptional.   Inconceivable!  She'd scream and cry and swing her hair and  &quot;dance&quot;, and then she'd bang on the piano..oh, she's got talent.   How could people say she does not know how to play the piano?   Inconceivable! But yes, I immediately went and bought the album.  I am so  glad I got a chance to hear When the Pawn first.  In concert, she did every  single song.  The songs are just...inconceivable.  She's still pissed off  at whoever did her wrong, and that is okay.   Time heals all wounds.  I'm  telling you, if you liked her first album, you will love her second!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I've listened to the whole CD and it's very catchy.  Not sure if it will do as well as her first album, but it's fun to listen to.
0767800958|4.0|. . .i was Quite amused by potter's indignance at realizing that veron was using her to break into films. maybe that fatuous, indulgence-accustomed artiste potter wouldn'ta got caught so laughably off-guard had she taken a  more realisitic page from camille paglia: &quot;in western society, there  are no non-exploitative relationships&quot; :) but whutthehell, a fantasy's  a fantasy, and if she can dress it up nice &amp; sell it (and for the most  part she could, except the notion that this veron could actually be  interested in her That Way), i'll buy :)
B00004T8RK|4.0|This new Cd is awsome. But they have changed there sound a bit. Now with  me I really like there new found sound. IT RULES. I hope that everybody  will go and purchace this Cd !                        Eric
630529142X|1.0|I could go on and on about this movie, but I would only be rehashing already stated views. Adam Sandler is funny, this movie is not. This movie is horrible and I can think of no bigger waste of money.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I have been listening to Pearl Jam ever since Ten came out. So far, they have never disappointed their fans, and with this album they continue giving good music. This CD has some great songs like nothing as it seems,  insignificance. As all their fans know, initially you like few songs but  eventually you end up liking the whole album. My favorite on this one  is  parting ways. If you liked Vitalogy and No Code, you will love this album.  Even though this CD has a strong lineup what it lacks is Jeremy or Alive.  It also lacks songs like Higher(Creed) or Otherside(Red Hot Chili Peppers)  which can put them on top.
0446677450|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki's thinking, and this book in particular, helped me make an immense paradigm shift.  Prior to reading this book, I had goals of a certain income or having a certain amount of money.  This book changed  everything and got me to focus on passive income and having money work for  me!   It only took me six months to fully apply Kiyosaki's principles to  the extent that I would never have to work again.  As a result, I can  easily say that this is perhaps the most valuable book I have ever read  about money.
0783244320|5.0|This is a extremly funny movie with Tim Allen.  I loved thismovie the first time I rented it knowing that a lot of people told meit was a great movie.  I rented it for and I loved the movie the first time.  I had to watch it again and then return it.  This is a great comedy who like Star Trek and would recomend it for anybody.  I will have to bye my own copy on DVD.  It is a great buy!
B000000993|5.0|Tool is my all time favorite group known to man! This cd is really good! The thing that really keeps me listening and interested in their music is the fact that they're not pure grunge metal. Instead, they start a song  heavy, and gradually they slow a beat down and make really soothing and  intriguing rhythms. Now, you can call me crazy, but I think that that is a  really good quality in music. All I'm saying is that Tool might not be the  most heaviest group in the world, but when it comes to REAL music, and true  riffs and a beautiful sound in quality, TOOL is the best group in the  world....at least in my eyes they are. Trust me, you will love this cd.  There's a special apperance from Henry Rollins from &quot;The Rollins  Band&quot; in the 4th track titled: &quot;Bottom&quot;. My favorite songs  on this cd are : &quot;Bottom&quot;, &quot;Undertow&quot;, &quot;4  Degrees&quot;, and &quot;Disgustapated&quot;.
0385473788|5.0|This story provoked a feeling inside of me I haven't felt in a long time. Beautifully written and sad beyond belief. I strongly recommend this book to those of us out there who haven't felt a strong emotion in a long time  and whom strive to be wrapped up in a book much like this. All around  wonderful!
0679416781|5.0|A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN, SUSPENSEFUL ROMANCE NOVEL!   After reading The English Patient, by Michael Ondaatje, a booker-prize winning novel, you will finish the last chapter with a sense of triumph and passion for life.   Written in 1992, this story takes place during World War II.  A burned man,  the English patient, finds refuge in an Italian villa where a compassionate  nurse, Hanna, tends to his dying wishes.  Through all of the scars and  wounds readers will discover the lives of four mysterious people as they  unravel and share the dangerous secrets of the past.  Controlled by  morphine, the English tells of his love and loss of his friends wife  Katherine.  We also learn that Hanna, the nurse, is discovering her own  love, Kip.  Clifton soon hears of his wife's, Katherine's, torrid love  affair with the English patient.        It baffles me to think that a more  beautifully written novel of romance and betrayal could exist.  There is,  however, a movie that does serve it justice, The English Patient.  Though I  do recommend the movie, which won nine Academy awards, I do wish you'd read  the book first.     This book is for the romantics and those looking for a  challenge.  The characters being and details of their life are only brought  about between the lines.  This novel takes you through a series of lives,  places , and event which are in no real chronological order.      The  outcome of events is revealed through such imagery and sometimes lack ther  of,  &quot;They would carry a severed arm down a hall, or swab at blood  that never stopped, as if the wound were a well, and they began to believe  in nothing, trusted nothing.&quot; or &quot;Blood. Tear.  He feels  everything is missing from his body, feels he contains smoke.&quot;       The story also provides images in the desert and in the villa with life  like qualities.      The story also gives insight into the culture and  lifestyles of the characters in that time period.  An example of the  differencein culture portrayed in the book was when one character had his  thumbs removed as a punishment for commiting adultery.      There are a few  setbacks such as the confusing order of events.  The story jumps from place  to place and period to period.      Overall, I strongly recommend this book  for the romantic in all of us.
B00000JCB2|2.0|I don't really get this, they had a GREAT sound on 3$BillYall but now they pulled a &quot;Korn&quot; as my friend calls it and went from good to bad. Here's my ratings of the tracks, excluding &quot;Intro&quot; and  &quot;Outro&quot;,<br />Just Like This-Not too bad but not an opener worthy of  a Limp album, especially after 2DBY's pollution.<br />Nookie-What is the big  deal with this song? If you haven't heard it you must be living under a  rock or something, MTV overplayed it.<br />Break Stuff-Their latest single,  lacks any meaning, the whole thing is F this and F that.<br />Re-Arranged-Slow  song, until the end, one of the better songs.<br />I'm Broke-Uhhhh this just  sucks. It's the low point of the album.<br />Nobody Like You-It's saving grace  is Jonathon from Korn, otherwise it would suck.<br />Don't Go Off  Wandering-Bad song so very poor.<br />9 Teen 90 nine-I was really expecting  more from this album...<br />N 2 Gether Now-This is why it got 2 stars. The  world's best MC kills on this song.<br />Trust?-It's ok, beats are good.<br />No  Sex-My favorite slow song, may be the only soulful song the album  has.<br />Show Me What You Got-Chorus on this is good, Wes's guitars are  good.<br />A Lesson Learned-Bad, bad, ending.

B00000J2KT|4.0|Full Metal Jacket presents some very real looking scenes. Basic training presented a good picture but if you didn't serve, you lose some of the impact. I've read where some say the D.I. was brutal, etc. This guy was a  perfect example of a drill instructor in the 60's. That was life in the  military, then.  But the movie. Outstanding content. Great characters. I'd  really like to see it available in a widescreen anamorphic format. It's  much too intense for just the standard version! The combat / ambush  scene(s) would be awesome. 4 stars ONLY because of the available  &quot;standard&quot; only format. Otherwise it would be a BIG 5!

0800177975|5.0|John McTiernan's &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; is always looked at as one of the big flops in modern day cinema.  The truth is the film is a lot better than a lot of people are willing to admit.  In Woody Allen's  &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; a desperate women falls in love with a  character in a film she watches who just happens to jump out of the screen.   Well it is basically the same sort of formula only a kid gets in on the  action of the latest Schwarzenegger film, &quot;Jack Slater 4&quot; yet  befriends the character and not the actor who thinks all of it is real and  not a film.  True, it is not as bittersweet as Allen's movie but I don't  find that to be a flaw.  It is a very fun movie and it was very enjoyable  the whole way through.   Arnold Schwarzenegger does a great parody of  himself as Slater who spits out one liners during violent conflicts.  I  even found Austin O' Brien to be a fairly decent child actor in this film  and that is a rare suprise in this sort of a film.  The film is also backed  by a great score of hard rock music from AC/DC, Alice in Chains, Megadeath  and more.  John McTiernan and Arnold Schwarzenegger suffered heavy blows  with this film.  True, it was not either of their best work but I think the  critics were way too cruel.  Its should not be viewed as a failure but as  an enjoyable action adventure that it is.

6302799066|5.0|Have you ever seen that ol film  William Castle,s &quot;The Tingler&quot; in the opening of that film Mr. Castle describes &quot; The Tingler&quot; and how to eliminate its release from ones self. He says &quot; Just  scream&quot;!  and The Tingler will be gone.<br />Well, this unique film will  make you mad...make you scream possibly..make you upset probably..and will  evoke  any other human emotion Mr. Kubrik might plumb up from the depths of  his mastery. One can view this farce on any level you wish.  Peter Sellers  is stunning in all three roles..Hayden is perfect as the lynch pin for the  end of the world.<br />George C. Scotts moments in this film are truly special  and maddening. Slim Pockens was not the original one to &quot;ride the  bomb&quot; but was picked in the end. <br />Timeless, staggering and please  Hollywood...dont remake this film into an &quot; action film&quot; Kubrik  is gone now..lets remember his superb films ..Hollywoods present accoutant  run studios have not a clue..
B00003CX9Q|5.0|When I was a kid, I saw this film seven times, just on the theater. Since then many years have passed. I now have my own little kid, and let me tell you, the first movie I though on buying to him was this. No other movie has  moved me such as &quot;E.T.&quot;, the loving little alien truly captures  your heart and just makes you weep of joy (and a bit of sadness, specially  whe he leaves). I am really looking forward for the DVD edition of this  movie.
B000000WFF|5.0|I got this for Christmas two years ago and I liked it from the start! &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; is a great song to put at the beginning of the CD. And it just got better from there. <br />As for &quot;Denying&quot;  and &quot;Viva Forever&quot;, I have to admit I don't listen to them that  much unless I'm in the mood to listen to those songs. But I still like them  though.<br />And as I said in my summary, I think it's better than their debut  CD. In fact, I can't wait to get their new CD(if it comes out soon)! <br />And  no, I am NOT a teenybopper!
B00004T8RK|1.0|I was really looking forward to the release of this album. However, it turned out to be a big disappointment. I bought it this morning and listened to it for two times, and I can only say that I find it extremely  boring. No melodies that can carry a tune (and those few melodies that  might be able to do so are embarrassingly clichd), no surprising song  structures, no or hardly any remarkable or memorable guitar riffs. In  absence of these things, bands quite often turn to 'oddities' like, for  example, using technically wrong chords, as in &quot;Soon forget&quot;,  etc. Things like that may make a good song more interesting, but they can  not turn a dull song into an exciting one. Unfortunately, it seems as if  Pearl Jam have run out of ideas.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I've had this CD since Saturday when someone made a mistake and put it out early at a local store, and I really like every song on it.  The CD is much more diverse and mature than &quot;..Baby One More Time&quot; and I can say  after seeing Britney live once (and waiting to see her again on July 7th)  that she is a very talented performer and I hope &quot;Oops!...I Did It  Again&quot; shatters every sales record.
B00000GUZP|5.0|What i can say is: none of us like's every track on a cd. This is a goldmine of every track. Do not try to classify this cd under one or 11 cat egories because it is impossible. Standouts: Backfired, Jump Jump, Chrome,  Under Arrest, Oasis. This is a solo Debbie Harry gem. Remember that!
6304196784|5.0|This movie is so extremely funny! It will appeal to Monty Python fans and Monty Python haters alike. This is because it isn't really &quot;Pythonesque&quot; in its humor, but Python fans will enjoy seeing  John Cleese and Micheal Palin in different roles.       I love this movie  because the plot twists and turns; you never know who's going to end up  with Wanda or the fortune until the very, very end. It's so well acted,  too. Kevin Kline deserved the Oscar he won for it!  You'd never guess Palin  didn't have a stutter in real life, he acts so well. I'd reccomend this  movie to anyone in the mood for a good laugh.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears more than avoids the sophomore jinks, she blows it away. I have heard both albums, and &quot;Oops!.. I Did It Again&quot; is, by no doubt, a far better album. Britney's voice has matured, is clearer, and  more consistant on this album.  <br />&quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;Stronger&quot;,  &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;One Kiss From You&quot;, &quot;Don't Go  Knockin' On My Door&quot;, and &quot;Can't Make You Love Me&quot; will be  hard to choose from singles for future hits.  The album lacks the lulls of  &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; like &quot;E-mail My Heart&quot;.<br />If  you thought Britney was good, okay (as I did), or even a skeptic with her  first album, you will really enjoy her new album, and is well worth the  purchase.  5 stars, and she deserves it.
0446677450|1.0|The author states in the book that he's a terrible writer, but he sells  a lot of books. He's quite correct, unfortunately. This book takes about 160 pages to say what could be summarized in a few paragraphs. Save money, try  to stay out of debt, invest your savings for the long run in assets that  will appreciate in value and eventually generate income for you. All good  advice, but The Millionaire Next Door was much more readable and practical.  I also like Eight Steps to Seven Figures. For that matter the Motley Fool  website is outstanding for common sense personal finance. All would be  better uses of your time than reading this. This book gives no hands on  advice about anything. For example, let's say you have no assets, a pile of  debt etc. How do you change that? This book says &quot;use your mind&quot;.  That's nice but some real solid advice would certainly be preferable in my  opinion.

B00004RFDW|4.0|Engaging and well-performed: Russell Crowe does an exceptionally good job of portraying an ordinary man under extroardinary pressure (incidentally, I think that's a line from the movie itself.) Worth watching for the subtle  brilliance of his performance alone. Plumber is equally remarkable as Mike  Wallace. Al Pacino is ... well ... Al Pacino, but ... that's always fun to  see, and his intensity keeps the film compelling and taut. The peculiar  soundtrack, pieced together and composed by, I believe, a Dead Can Dance  member, adds a nice, mildly surreal/ethereal undercurrent to the events,  although at times it is a bit too much. There's a very subtle sort of ...  new-age, flittering acoustic guitar refrain ... which is used brilliantly  -- and is that actually Einsturzende Neubauten playing at one point? I  could swear it was. However, the choral stuff gets a touch overbearing here  and there. <br />It isn't quite a masterpiece -- did we really need the  &quot;guys like you are in short supply in this world&quot; exchange  between Pacino and Crowe? I prefer not to be instructed what to think of  the characters and their circumstances, and you have to imagine an exchange  like that was added for dramatic effect. There are a few little details  like this that I could've done without. It's a fairly minor complaint  however, and the Insider was, on the whole, well worth the time.
B0000025ZF|5.0|This is probably my favorite of Roger's three solo albums.  I listen to it all the time.  I love all the melodies and the music is totally awesome.  I like the way he brings back some of the melodies from his former Pink Floyd  albums, especially the melody from Mother that he brings back at different  points in the CD.  This is one of those albums where the songs flow  together to form one big song.  And it tells a story, much like the rest of  the Floyd stuff. Check it out! I'm going to see Roger in concert next  month.  I hope he does some of this stuff.
6305132984|4.0|It was a good movie but it was not the best ever therefore it doesn't deserve 5 stars. The songs and dances such as &quot;America&quot; and the &quot;Act cool&quot; song were really good because it stuck in peoples  heads However it can't really be called a Romeo and Juliet movie because if  it was it would require both &quot;star crossed lovers&quot; to die in the  film which did not happen.
0064471837|5.0|We've all read stories starring the tough girl, out to kick the world head over tail kind of character. Sadly, these characters all too often have nothing better to do with their time than to wander around playing hero.  Don't get me wrong- I love books with female heroines. But sometimes you  get that feeling that they lack- well- heart. All too often the tough girl  stance gets taken a little too far. Which is why I love this book. Sabriel  is entirely human- a young woman who has her own goals, her own life, and  who manages to uphold her values without ever giving in. Yet staunchness  does not make the character; Sabriel's basic humanity is what lets her  reach out and touch you from within her paper world. She gets angry, she  gets even. She loves Touchstone, hates the evil that has invaded the  Kingdom, treasures her father, respects Mogget. . . . It is almost a relief  to 'meet' a character with such basic reasons. Don't get me wrong; there's  nothing elemental about Sabriel. She has her reasons for doing what she  does, and Gareth Nix does an exceptional job of writing within the female  Psyche. I have, on occassion, run into those few and far between writers  whose opposite sex characters behave nothing like real people, and have  always regretted the experience.  Okay- anyway, I found Nix's characters  to be richly portrayed, human, rational, and logical. Better still was his  world- on one side, a person might have a life much like ours. On the other  you have a place where magic still thrives, and the great charters rule the  land. The tension is nicely played out, the book climaxes nicely, and the  end is resolved fairly satisfactorially. I certainly would not quibble with  the concept of a sequel- In fact, for a book this good, I can only hope  that at some point Nix returns and writes a sequel- either about Sabriel or  about one of the Abhorsens before her; maybe the story of her father or the  woman who built the paperwings. One can only hope.
B000002V0Q|4.0|My musical taste had just started blossoming when I was in the 6th grade. At this time, grunge was was at it's peak, while bands like Metallica, GNR, and Faith no More were also at their peaks. It was a wonderful time for  rock music. Anyways, I remember seeing the older kids in my school wearing  shirts bearing the name 'Megadeth' on it. My curiosity got the best of me,  so I started to ask my friends about them. A week later, I purchased  'Countdown to Extinction' on cassette.<br />This album is Megadeth at their  peak. This was when their songwriting ability had started to mature, but  before it became too commercial. &quot;Skin O' My Teeth&quot; opens up the  album with a bang. Then, comes the best song on the album, &quot;Symphony  of Destruction&quot;. This is THE song to play really loud in your car  while driving down the freeway. Megadeth keeps up the pace for the next few  songs, and the album (to me at least), climaxes with the title track, a  blistering commentary on, you guessed it, animal extinction. From there on,  though, the songs start to sound repetitive and don't quite match up to the  first 7. Still, the album is worth getting for these songs, and is an  excellent starting point for someone to get into Megadeth, as well as a  must have in any metal fan's collection.
6305176299|5.0|&quot;Speed&quot; in my opinion ranks as one of the best action movies of all time. It has a clever plot, excellent pacing, great direction. This film is a non stop ride, it never slows down. Most of the other reviews for  this movie are correct so there isn't much more I can say that hasn't been  said already.
0451526384|3.0|This book might have been a small chapter of a tremendous book.  Perhaps it was curtailed by intent.  A shallow, somewhat childish plot serves as background for significant character development of Anne Elliot, initially  portrayed as a shy retiring late 20s wallflower, but every character,  including her Wentworth, view Anne as an intelligent obviously gorgeous  woman.  What we do have in Persuasion is the admirable psychological  manipulation by Anne of her own environment, and though we may be less than  entranced by a tale of the English idle rich, we do have a woman of strong  mind weaving through a soap opera society of parties, walks by the sea and  cards. If able to ignore the vacuous background of the novel, we have good,  somewhat humorless auto-pilot type writing showing perhaps more potential  than actual accomplishment.  I read Pride and Prejudice 30 years ago and  remember absolutely nothing about it except that I liked the book.   Persuasion very likely will leave a similar impression.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|I liked the fighting and the club was fantastic! Fight plus club equals &quot;Fight Club&quot;!
006097625X|5.0|este libro, que trata sobre las posiblidades de los dibuijos y los disenos de diferentes formas, es muy entretenido ya que nos lleva por un mundo de dibujos donde el propio escritor es uno de ellos que nos guia e instruye a  traves del libro de una manera amena. me gusto la forma en que esta  escrito, si hubisese sido un mero libro sobre dibujo en el que abundara la  teoria,no me hubiera interesado, pero el libro es atrayente desde la  portada, ya que parece un libro de comics. muy bueno,, no solo para los  estudiantes de los comics sino para todo aquel que le interese aprender de  manera divertida..

B00004SCX6|4.0|The songs on Britney's second album are a less &quot;bubble-gum pop&quot; and more heavier in sound and bass.  I certainly liked the album overall a lot more than her first, I guess you can say she's maturing.  The  down-side, I think, is all that dialogue.  It's only cute the first time  around.  The album is quite upbeat, and is worth the buy.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I never really was a major fan of Britney's.  But when I heard this album, I changed my mind.  This CD has pretty good songs.  The best one is &quot;Can't Make You Love Me&quot;.  Another good one is &quot;One Kiss From You&quot;.  The only songs that weren't that good were &quot;When Your  Eyes Say It&quot; and &quot;(Can't Get No) Satisfacton&quot;.  Overall, the  CD is really good and you should definetely get it.   Thank you!
B00000JTB2|5.0|The combination of blues and rock 'n roll in this album couldn't be better!  The conversation between Albert King and Stevie Ray Vaughn seem to make the album a bit more personal for the listener and compliments the  music.  The two were obviously having a great time while recording this  album and it shows in the music.  I only wish they had lived to make more  great music together!
B00004SCX6|4.0|I had to go out and buy Britney's new cd.  This cd shows her in kind of a transition.  The new cd is more techno and R&amp;B influenced than her first cd (Baby One More Time.) Her first cd was more pop. The title track  is very infectuous, and sounds similiar to B1MT.  While she is not the best  singer there is, people buy her records not because of her voice, but  because she's a good performer.  And since she's sold millions of records,  she's making music that people LIKE. And it does take talent to make fun  music, just like any other kind of music.  My favorite song has to be  &quot;Don't Let Me be the Last to Know.&quot; It is a sweet love song  written by Shania Twain and Mutt Lang. &quot;Lucky&quot; is a song about a  lonely Hollywood movie star.  &quot;Dear Diary&quot; is cowritten by  Britney herself, and I think it was a good try!  I think a lot of teenagers  will relate to it.  Overall, I really like her new sound.  I think that if  you liked Baby One More Time then you should also give Oops I Did it Again  a listen. It was very much worth the wait.
B000003N7K|5.0|Buy this album, buy it now.  There have been few albums that I can listen to at any time, over and over again; night and day, year in year out. This is one of them.  Coltrane and Hartman merge into a musical ghost of  haunting perfection.  There are times that I cannot tell the difference  between the two- it is that smooth.  The arrangements are wonderful, the  selection classy, the packaging gorgeous.  There is nothing that I would  not rate as 5 stars about this album- for that matter 11 stars and higher.   Coltrane and Hartman is the best realized duet between a voice and soloist  ever: period!  A rare gem.  A gift.  Truly a gift.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Well this cd,has good music tunes that would make you get up and dance. But you could tell that Britney Spears used a lot of computer technology to fix her voice while making this cd and some songs have interludes that can  actually bug you after awhile. Plus this cd is like a repeat from her first  album which is called Baby One More Time. If you are a truly a Britney  Spears fan i would recommend this cd for you to buy. But if you really  aren't that much of a Britney Spears fan like me, i would juss buy tha  singles. You can save a lot of money for a better cd.
B00004SU5J|5.0|Listening to &quot;Tourist&quot; I'm wondering a new trend is born: after the pure 'techno sound' something lighter, sweeter and cooler as appeared. A kind of re-discovery of jazz sounds, just as we had forgot them  somewhere... not so far. hear at this kind of &quot;never died&quot; music  and feel it so deeply!
B000002BYD|5.0|In my experience, there are two kinds of Pearl Jam fans:  there are the ones who look forward to seeing Pearl Jam grow and evolve as musicians and story tellers AND then there are those who will never get past thinking  JEREMY is the greatest Pearl Jam song and anything else, anything  different, is just a misguided attempt to get away from what put these guys  on the map as one of the most important bands of the last ten  years.<br />Jeremey was great, but he's gone now.  In his wake you have  something just as powerful and just as fun,if not more, to listen to.  The  gradual shift into unchartered musical waters from Vitalogy to No Code  comes to a head in Yield, where we have a grown up Pearl Jam.  In this  album they span from true rock ballads (Wishlist) to bluesy rock (No Way)  with the same kind of intensity that we've seen on earlier albums on tracks  like Faithfull.<br />YIELD is Pearl Jam's best album (there, I said it) not  only because the music is grownup and new, varied and original, but because  it is liner notes for a way of different, much needed way of looking at  life.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, listen to Yield, read  Daniel Quinn's novel, ISHMAEL, and then tell me if Pearl Jam's lasting  impression should be EVEN FLOW.<br />YIELD + ISHMAEL = new outlook on life
B00004SCX6|4.0|well, britney spears is out again huh?....this new cd as i listen to it right now has a much different sound.  when you listen to 'stronger' you can tell that she has grown up and has a much more full voice.  the cd has  a little bit more of an in your face idea.  it grabs the old listeners and  also can pull new ones.  if you liked her first cd, go out and grab this  one, its also good, but an artist no matter how good they are can never top  their debut cd.  when you think about it, it has a little of a style like  Destiny's Child...if you refer to track 3 'don't go knocking on my door'  that is.  as a whole the cd is still very good and i recommend that you go  out and get it, it'll be what you exspect, but just as a last note...she's  deffinently grown up.

0060931671|4.0|For no particular reason, I've avoided reading Pynchon novels but finally decided to take the plunge with this book.  I was not disappointed.<br />I thought it was great.  Really great, actually.  His writing style strikes  me as very similar to a number of his contemporaries (Robert Stone,  DeLillo, etc.).  The central riddle of the book and the mixing of obscure  historical fact and fiction reminded me strongly of authors like  Borges.<br />With regard to some of the negative reviews below I would say the  following:<br />1.  I consider myself a pretty typical reader and I did not  find this to be a particularly challenging book to read, although Pynchon's  style (punctuation-sparse and prone to occasional lapses into heavy factual  detail) takes some getting used to.<br />2.  This is not a &quot;neat&quot;  story in the conventional sense.  There isn't a tidy conclusion to the  story and there isn't a &quot;typical&quot; character development arc.  But  so what?  I don't think either of those things are a necessary requirement  to good fiction.  <br />The deliberately silly-sounding character names should  be the first clue that Pynchon does not intend this to be a conventional  work of fiction.  It isn't.  But that doesn't mean it's not a great  book.<br />The book is clever, well-written, and confounding with its plot  twists and turns.  That's what made it a fascinating read and that's also  what makes it the kind of book that I think I could read over and over  again and not get bored.  I think I'll always find something new that I  didn't see before.<br />Isn't that what makes a book enjoyable to read in the  first place?
B0000088ET|5.0|the answer for Deep Purple Fan in Berlin is YEA! because this life album is the best material on stage in the Rock n roll history. This life album is a commercial life album, but it doesnt matter! why? because logically  DEEP PURPLE has not only made the album MADE IN JAPAN, but they also made  alot of many other spectacular life albums too... this album is one of the  accurate example how DEEP PURPLE had been one of the most powerfull HARD  ROCK monster in the rock n roll history....    PS: My humble opinion this  album is much better than LED Zeppelins life album SONGS REMAINS THE  SAME.... LONG LIVE DEEP PURPLE
B000003S0I|5.0|Larks Tongues is as important or maybe more so than In The Court Of The Crimson King or Discipline in the development of Crimso music. A complex record that took me a long time to appreciate fully.Gone were the days of  the &quot;temporary&quot; line-ups. Bruford, Wetton, and Cross would surely  stick around long enough to tour more than any Crimson before them had.  They were also the best musicians since the original '69 line-up. The real  story on Larks is experimental percussionist Jamie Muir, who colors this  music with thumb piano, bird calls, laugh-in-a -box, you name it.I believe  that playing with Muir certainly altered Bruford from his Yes days(they  were a fairly mainstream group ALWAYS in comparison to Crimson who were  then and still are now the cutting edge in prog)and shaped him into the  musician he is today. The two part title cut beginning and ending the  record is a work of power and beauty. &quot;Book Of Saturday&quot; is on a  par with earlier ballads like &quot;I Talk To The Wind&quot; and  &quot;Cadence And Cascade&quot;. &quot;Exiles&quot; is grand in the  tradition of &quot;Epitaph&quot; and the debut album's title cut.  &quot;Easy Money&quot; is both sinister and rocking, much like &quot;Cat  Food&quot; was on Poseidon. The sudden transition from the tension building  &quot;Talking Drum&quot; to &quot;LTIA Pt. 2&quot; is a classic moment in  the history of album rock. Hail the King!
0767803434|1.0|I would rather watch my window cactus grow for the next hour and a half than spend it watching this pathetic excuse for a patriotic flick.<br />This movie is the most deluded, clueless and far from the truth piece of trash I  have ever seen. One of the things I could barely deal with was the  insulting patriotic ignorance and horrible acting. Aside from that its full  of ludicrous dialogs that could only seem real to a 5 year old kid. Did I  mention a boring predictable plot?<br />Oh and those evil Russians who do it  for mother Russia, give me a brake. I have some Russian friends who  couldn't believe idiotic depiction of Russians in this flick.<br />If you are  still stuck in cold war period go ahead and buy yourself a copy it will  prolong the state of ignorance you are in.
B00000J6AG|4.0|Play gives me the same 'lost' feeling when I listen to Orbit's 'Pieces'. Funny, original, loose and a bit sexystrange, fresh and almost perfect for every situation. But PLAY is a lot deeper than that. These pieces are  sophisticated, unmitigated and very smart. The album often frightens me,  then I turn it off and wonder when Moby looks serious.
0375703764|5.0|people seem very passionate about this book: either the reader loves it, or the reader hates it, and no reader seems to fall somewhere in between without writing something like &quot;this would have been an excellent  STORY without the baggage of esoteric 'marginalia' (i.e., the footnotes,  which i would probably argue are margins in the derridean sense, pulling  apart the STORY - your longed for 'center' or 'point' or 'enlightenment'),  and without the submersion of the 'scary' stuff about the uncanny house  beneath many layers of &quot;unimportant&quot; and &quot;extraneous&quot;  material which a reader expecting a straightforward readerly novel (like  king or other pop fiction) with beginning-middle-resolution. this is not  the way to approach house of leaves, and if you begin it expecting a  linear, clear, authoritative narrative, then you are going to be  disappointed.  in that case i suggest that you do not even attempt house of  leaves, because you are going to dislike it and struggle with it.  if you  are going to enjoy this book - and it is a wonderful book, playing always  with the very expectations of the reader, but also the possible forms of  narrative itself, and concepts of authority, centrality, power (political  &amp; personal, for they are the same) - then you are going to have to  approach it expecting it to violate all of the descriptive rules you have  in your mind about narrative form and STORYtelling.  you are going to have  to read it carefully, thinking about every word, reading every footnote,  but also remaking the text for yourself, making it your own and divorcing  it from the sense and reference of the words themselves.  you must be  willing to work through the text slowly and carefully to get from it any  pleasure, untainted by disappointment.  if you are not willing to give that  effort, then this book &quot;is not for you.&quot;  pass it, and the hype  by, and pick up the next king novel, which you will enjoy, because he will  meetyour expectations rather than challenging them.  however, i think it  would be excellent for you to let lax your preconceptions and opinions, and  put much effort into this amazing text, and to decolonize your  &quot;STORY&quot; and &quot;center&quot; and &quot;point/moral&quot; and  enlightenment&quot; obsessed mind by combatting this text.
630512762X|5.0|FACE/OFF, directed by Hong-Kong star director, John Woo, is a scientific thriller deserving to be in the top ten american movies of 1997. Destined to a larger public than the usual John Woo aficionados, FACE/OFF has been  carefully written in order to please the average moviegoer looking for the  bang-bang ride promised by the name of the director, as well as the movie  buff expecting a little more than an outstanding visual feast.<br />Castor and  Pollux, greek heroes of the Troy-an war, Adam (Castor's son) and Eve  (Archer's wife) are well-known couples of our western cultural background.  Mirrors, lost identities, bad and evil, black and white are also literary  and cinematographical themes we have often encountered in our lives of  curious movie lovers. So what ! Let's admit that it's the first time I've  seen so important themes treated in a so flamboyant manner.<br />Just a final  word regarding the actors : Nicolas Cage clearly steals the show by pushing  John Travolta to his limits which are, alas, too visible. A great salute to  the editors and the stuntmen also.<br />A DVD for your library.

6305810109|5.0|The Straight Story is a pure old-fashioned lyrical gem, an ode to a vanishing America of sweet pastoral poetry.  Veteran actor Richard Farnsworth once again proves (effortlessly) that he's a national treasure  of Americana, almost as if he'd stepped out of a Norman Rockwell painting.   Farnsworth gets my personal Oscar vote for Best Actor.<br />WHO MIGHT LIKE  THIS MOVIE:  fans of Richard Farnsworth's acting ... lovers of Pat  Metheny/Charlie Haden's CD &quot;Beyond the Missouri Sky&quot; ... lovers  of Adagio movements in Mozart concertos ... people who hated American  Beauty, and feel nostalgia for a slower, more humane, compassionate,  pastoral  American landscape.<br />WHO MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE: viewers who  prefer action, a brisk pace, well-groomed celebrity actors, and modern  urban drama ... people uncomfortable with a slow country pace, impatient  with quiet poetry and understated details.
B00001QGPS|5.0|Wu-Tang and Def Squad together, what could be better combo.  This CD is so funny.  It seems them being together brings the best out of eachother.  Mef is probably the more talented rapper but Funk Doc brings on humor.  Cuts  like &quot;Da Rockweilder&quot; and &quot;Maaad Crew&quot; makes this CD a  must have in any Hip Hop collection.
B00004TDRD|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Jaws. It is one of my favorite movies. And what a cast! Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss! This movie scared people so bad that there was a shark killing spree after the release of Jaws. I guess  this is one horror story that actually got through to it's audience. If you  do not like Jaws, or you do not buy this movie, you have NO taste  whatsoever. This is a Classic. I also suggest reading the novel. Both are  well worth your time.

B00004SCX6|1.0|Oops, I think I did it again. I have heard that stupid song so many times I have it memorized. I don't even care what she looks like, you can't see her when your listening to the radio. I can almost guarantee that the  number of people that don't like this review will be about twice as big as  the people that like, but just listen to the CD. There are 2 types of  songs, upbeat and annoying, slow and annoying. This will be just like  N'Sync and go strait to the top on MTV. I can't wait till Eminem and Kid  Rock come out. At least half the guys in the country don't have a crush on  them, I hope.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Here is a quick review of each song on Britney Spears' sophmore album, &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again.&quot; Remember, these are my opinions on the songs. Basically you have to listen to all the tracks in order, because the whole album is a story. And she closes it with &quot;Dear Diary&quot;,  reflecting on her day.<br />Oops:  Amazing song, some kind of remembrance to  her first hit single, &quot;Baby One More Time.&quot;<br />Stronger:  I LOVE  this song, its by far one of the best songs, the lyrics are amazing and the  beat is just so up and positive. F or anyone who has ever been through any  kind of conflict, its such a defining song.<br />Dont go knockin on my door:   Eh, well of all of them its not my favorite, but it's still a cool song  with a great beat. But I gotta love it anyways 'cause it's  Britney.<br />Satisfaction:  Not a very good remake of the Rolling Stones  classic. I don't really like the beginning of the song either (the tempo  and beat).<br />Dont let me be the last to know: This is going to be her  second single off the new album. It's written by Shania Twain and her  husband, Mutt Lang. The words to this song are outstanding. A great slow  song. It really eases your mind.<br />What U see if what U get:  The opening  bars are just so cool; it gets u into the song right away.  Another strong  defining song. The beat throughout the song is awesome.<br />Lucky: I love it,  it's a great tune, melody and beat. I love how her voice sounds in this  one, I can't really explain it. You'll have to hear this one yourself. Her  voice is kinda funky.<br />One Kiss From you:  It sorta sounds like something  from the last album, but you can tell it's not because of the maturity in  her voice. I like it, it definitely has potenial to be one of my  faves.<br />Where are you now:  After a few days of listening to it, I love  it, it's one of the few ballads that she has done, and she really shows off  her voice in it, and of course we know the power she has inher  voice.<br />Cant make you love me:  i would LOVE for this song to be the next  single, but unfortunately &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot; is.  it's fun, and yet moving at the same time.  The beat and words just make it   one of the best!<br />When your eyes say it:  it kinda reminds me of that all  saints song, &quot;Never Ever In The Start&quot;, but then it goes into a  different style completely.  she has that breathy airy touch to her voice  in this song.  and she actually pulls  off the talking in this song.<br />Dear  Diary:  An ok song, a good choice though in her track placement. It's of  course, the last track. It kinda has the finishing touch and tempo for the  last track. A nice smooth and peaceful tone. She reflects in this song  about the previous songs. If you haven't figured it out, all the songs are  cumulative, the whole album is a story. <br />Kudos to Britney on this album,  I hope it goes far, shatters records and what not. It's already my favorite  album, along with her first one, &quot;Baby One More Time.&quot; She has  accomplished a lot, and as a fan, I am truly really proud of her.  :)...
B000002UA9|5.0|George Martin wanted to record these songs in the Cavern club but the technical facilities were inconvenient at that time so the plan vanished in the haze. In London, Martin would have liked to create the same sound and  he was successful. In the event the Please Please Me album has a very  specific sound, the sound of a living performance from the Cavern. The  songs are dynamic, vivid, full of strength with some musical mistakes like  crude unhewed but very precious gems. In my opinion this is the best  Beatles-album, beside Rubbel Soul which has the same powerful sound.
B00000J6AG|4.0|Listening to Play is rather like piling six or seven not-very-compatible CDs into the player and putting the thing on random. Got some gospel, some blues, some dance mix, some poetry. In fact, the CD player is sort of  broken and plays some at the same time. And yet it works, mostly.<br />So Play  works, mostly, if play can be said to work. Maybe it just plays. <br />__ So,  just play it. __
6301930827|5.0|Starting off with a nuclear war and building up from there, 'By Dawn's  Early Light' is one of a handful of decent American television movies. It  proceeds with all the demented logic of war, and has a surprisingly  bitter-sweet ending given that it would have been so easy to cop out.  That's why it works - it doesn't pull any punches.<br />The massively  under-utilised Powers Boothe heads a strong cast - anything with both Rip  Torn and James Earl Jones in it is good, and Martin Landau is his usual  haggard self. It's not really about people, though - it's about a giant  machine, a complex multi-functioning mechanism in which the people are the  weak link, a machine so large and spread so wide that no one person or  group of people can control it. It's best not to wonder how close this came  to happening in reality.<br />Although I can't comment on the overall  technical accuracy, the scenario seems solid, in the same way that the  still-fantastical '2001' seems grounded in reality. It looks good, too -  with this cast, it's obvious that money has been spent on it.<br />If you  liked this you might also like the novel 'Arc Light' by Eric L. Harry - it  has a similar theme, but without the constrains of a budget it's a lot  bigger and more epic, but at the same time less focussed. It also bears  comparison with the mid-80's BBC drama 'Threads', a memorably bleak  portrayal of life on the ground.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Tim Allen was great here. The plot was good, witty, and not plagued with pointless silliness. It had a real story that captured interest.
B000001AJG|5.0|Stevie Wonder once did a record called 'The Secret Life of Plants'. It was about plants, apparently. I don't really know. Stevie Wonder was a bit before my time, although I can remember 'Isn't she Lovely' being played on  the radio a lot, and 'I Just Called to Say I Love You', and 'Hello' which  was by Lionel Richie, but they're the same thing. I remember the latter  song having a touching video that, even now, moves me to tears - the  contrast between the blindness of the love interest, and the lines 'is it  me you're looking for' is bitter-sweet, and, along with 'Ebony and Ivory'  (which I think had Stevie Wonder as well), 'Hello' is one of the most  subversive, meaningful pop singles of the '80s. I don't think anybody  appreciates this at the moment, but eventually I will turn out to be right,  as always.<br />I can remember how everybody in 1985 used to go around  shouting about how 'Relax' by Frankie Goes to Hollywood was about rampant  gay sex, when in fact it was actually about the contemporary, and  phenominally-popular 'Cabbage Patch Kids'. Or 'Cabbage Patch Dolls', I'm  not sure. They were on the news all the time, with clips of American  housewives attacking each other in order to buy the last in the store, a  bit like 'Pokemon' but for grown-ups. 'Relax, don't do it, when you want to  suck it, chew it', sang Holly, presumably talking about the realistic  thumb-sucking that the dolls could indulge themselves with. 'Relax, don't  do it - when you want to come' to the store, obviously, and therefore we  have to assume that Holly was singing from the perspective of somebody in  the store already, perhaps a Cabbage Patch Doll him/her/itself.<br />There was  something about shooting stars, which might have had something to do with  the almost-equally popular 'My Little Pony' range, as they were festooned  with shooting stars as an ever-present motif.<br />I think that 'Two Tribes'  was probably something about politics, I don't know.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I thoght this alblm was excellent. This is ssssssssoooooooooooooo much better than the first. I recomend this album to anyone who liked the songs baby one more time and oops i did it again.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|Extremely well-remembered sci-fi/horror/comedy blockbuster from the mid-80's, almost uniquely combining a big budget, some great actors, broad-but-likeable characterisation and deadpan humour, as well as a  terrific period soundtrack. It spawned a forgettable sequel (a kind of  'Ghosbusters : The Dark Knights Return') and an all-time classic computer  game, famous for its ultra-beepy rendition of the title theme tune, in its  entirety. 'He slimed me!' indeed.<br />The effects still work nowadays, and  even if they didn't it doesn't matter, as the film lives and dies with the  writing, which is excellent. Dan Ackroyd has much less to do than the  others, Harold Ramis has a few good lines (and an 'Eraserhead' haircut),  but it's Bill Murray who takes the film, being the only 'normal' male  character. Rick Moranis is effective, too, as a love-struck dweed, and  Sigourney Weaver seems to enjoy playing an evilly-possessed enti-Ripley  vamp. The portrayal of research students is spot-on, too. There are tonnes  of extra stuff on the DVD as well - even in Region 2, so if you haven't  already got this on video you should snap it up.
0425156842|5.0|Sophie's World is beautifully written and masterfully crafted as a clever introduction into Western Philosophy. This book is unique in that it presents an outline of Western thought easily understandable by both  seventh graders and baby boomers. Golden!
6303212379|4.0|Everybody of a certain age (23-26 or so) will have seen this film at the cinema, or on television already. One of those Steven Speilberg films that wasn't actually directed by him (see also: 'Gremlins', 'Poltergeist', and  so forth), it features a gang of kids who shout constantly until you want  to torture them to death. And Corey Feldman (not Haim), too.<br />It's not as  good as you remember - action-wise, it doesn't get into gear until about  half-way through, and the kids are really, really irritating. It resembles  a less-expensive version of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', and  that was always the lesser of the Indy films.<br />Still, it passes a wet  boxing day well, and it's horrifying to think that, in a decade from now, a  futuristic version of me will only have 'Pokemon: The First Movie' to write  about.
0679882820|1.0|The board book version is a watered down mishmash of the original.  All the fun of Dr. Suess's original rhymes and rhythms is lost making this nothing more than an expensive chew toy for your infant.  Buy the original  and keep some scotch tape handy!
B000001ELR|5.0|I never understood why this CD got overlooked and everybody raves about &quot;Destroyer&quot;, which is a good CD but not nearly as dead on as this CD.  Since Ace is on the cover, it would have been interesting to see how  different this CD might have been if Ace actuallhy PLAYED on it.  Best  songs: &quot;Saint &amp; Sinner&quot;, &quot;War Machine&quot;,  &quot;Danger&quot; &quot;I Love It Loud&quot; &amp; &quot;Creatures Of The  Night&quot; The only clunker is &quot;Keep Me Comin'&quot;
B000002KD9|5.0|Harvest may have been bigger,but ATGR is a deeper ,more introspective album.Certainly inspired by his tenure in CSNY,their influence is as prevelent as his was on their Deja Vu album.Besides the classics(the title  track,Southern Man,Don't Let It Bring You Down)there are acoustic  nuggets(Birds,I Believe In You)that would've enhanced the somewhat  schitzophrentic Harvest.For those who are only Harvest fans,give ATGR a  listen and you'll feel you have stuck it rich.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Having Heard this Disc&amp;what not I'm Amazed at Her Popularity.The Music Here is No different than her First Disc.also The Material Her SOunds right along the Lines of N-Sync,Backstreet,Christina etc...The title cut alone is  Baby one more time with different words.Only The New Jack Swing of the  Rolling Stones Satisfaction captures anything different here.and that unto  itself is Suspect cuz DIE-Hard Rolling Stone Fans will Flip their Wigs on  that.but had Britney gone that Route instead of The Predictable one on the  Other songs She would have had an Interesting Disc.but this Set is pure  FORMULA.The Writing,Production&amp;The Sameness of The Vocals.aside from  that one song all hype&amp;no Substance.
B000002NC4|5.0|Much like Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted album, this was a record that was widely misunderstood when it first came out. Perfect From Now On made it on a few critics' year-end lists, usually with the &quot;... but the  songs are all too long&quot; caveat. Now, one studio and one live album  later, it's clear that all roads lead back to PFNO. This is nothing less  than the best headphone rock album of the 90s.<br />BTS has been called  &quot;Modest Mouse if they cared,&quot; but the (frequently-made)  comparison sells both bands short. BTS -- especially on this album -- is  like Mingus with an electic guitar. There are bands that have a somewhat  similar sound (Caustic Resin and Seam come to mind) but no one does it  quite the same.<br />Listen and be ennobled.
B000002UB3|5.0|Of all The Beatles Albums this one really stands out for me.The Words&amp;Music really come together Strongly here.This was a Very Well Produced Album.it is Timeless.it says Something of their Musical Importance  too Still Being able to make Albums this Essential even a Decade Deep into  their Careers.Now I'm Not a Big Fan of all their Stuff but the Material  that I do Like such as this Album Still Stand Out.Very Essential&amp;A Must  Have.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I wasn't sure if I should take her seriously at first, but here she is...doing a Stones cover no less.  Much more variety in her songs on this album, the time she took was worth it.  I saw her on SNL the other night  and was impressed with her ability to sing and dance to her songs in a less  formal atmosphere than the Grammies.  You have to give her credit as a  performer.  What's up Britney!
6305335745|5.0|Warning-the following review contains some spoilers,so read carefully.<br />This is a horror masterpiece.Well,sort of.The first three stories are only OK,but the film gets REALLY interesting and exciting when  you reach &quot;The Crate&quot;,which is arguably the best story.Hal  Holbrook gives off an impressive performance as  Henry and is perfect for  the part.The crate beast is awesome and is quite a powerhouse.At one point  he rips off part of a guy's face and bites off his ear.Lots of red bodily  fluid flowing! The last story,&quot;Their Crawling Up On You&quot;,is great  too.The bugs are incredibly eerie and Mr.Pratt's  death is quite gruesome  (I won't spoil it for you.) This is a terrific horror film.Tom Savini  delivers loads of gore and his work is awesome. The acting is above-average  and the script is pretty decent.The first three tales are OK,but won't  really hold your interest.&quot;Father's Day&quot; is a little  boring,&quot;The Lonesome Death Of Jordy Verrill&quot; is average and  &quot;Something To Tide You  Over&quot; just ain't too good,but the last  two stories rock.Their incredibly entertaining and quite gruesome.They are  able to earn the film the 5-star rating.Their that great.Buy it just for  the last two.They rock! Rated R for gruesome horror violence and some  strong language.
6305750750|5.0|As a HUGE Star Wars fan, I must admit I spent the months before this movie came out aching in suspense and anticipation, and when I finally got to see it opening night, after all those months of waiting...I wasn't  disappointed. True, Jar-Jar is pretty annoying, and the characters lack  some of the flair and humor that made us love the original trilogy  characters, this is still a worthwhile movie! I think it did an excellent  job of setting up the next two movies--that's why the plot  can seem drawn  out, Lucas is giving us the whole picture of what is going on for the next  two movies. In any case, the last twenty minutes of this movie are amazing,  they really show what the action will be like in the next two, which I can  hardly wait for!
B00004T8RK|1.0|Once again I rushed out to get the newest Pearl Jam Cd in hopes that they might accidently stumble back upon their glory days of Ten or VS.. Just like the times before I was let down. If these guys want to keep  experimenting with new directions for music do us a favor and stop selling  the results. &quot;Nothing as it seems&quot; should have been a clue. It  showed possible potential that they were back on track. However, since  &quot;nothing is as it seems&quot; I was mislead again. Rounding out the  album are tunes like &quot;soon forget&quot; which could even make Tiny Tim  cringe. Once again Pearl Jam disappoints.
B000002HH2|4.0|Bjork gives us another great work here. The album isn't perfect, but it has enough value for you to purchase it. &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;It's Oh so Quiet&quot; are worth the price of the cd alone. <br />As  always, Bjork comes thorough with interesting lyrics backed by unique  music. She's the queen odd, cool musik!
0783110928|5.0|Kudos to a clever script, smart direction and the magnificent performances of Angelina Jolie, Mercedes Ruehl and Elizabeth Mitchell. Sometimes some of the best movies are the ones that never make it to theaters. HBO has a  history of recognized original films, and this is one that I would  definetely recommend to anyone who has a fascination with the world of  modeling and show business.<br />Jolie, who is quite a character herself,  creates an accurate and stunning portrayal of the model who burned out as  quickly as she rose to fame in the ever-evolving world of fashion and  modeling. Spiraling downwards into a world of drugs, sex and violence,  Carangi lived hard and died young, her face forever immortalized by the  lens that first discovered her raw and intriguing appeal. No doubt about  it, she is an unforgettable icon in the industry, such as the scene  indicates where she rudely carves her name into the receptionist's counter  at the modeling agency who immediately takes her under their wing and turns  her from a feisty and fearless teenager into a seductive and ethereal  glamour goddess. Now this was a performance well-warranted of recognition  and the Golden Globes knew that, thus presenting Jolie with its high honors  as Best Actress.<br />Mercedes Ruehl was the perfect narrator for the story,  Gia's forlorn and almost flaky mother, boning up her daughter's legacy with  childhood memories and the typical endearments only mothers could enjoy.  Then there's the wonderful supporting role of Linda, Gia's on-again  off-again girlfriend, who is played with wonderful restraint by Elizabeth  Williams. The only character with enough sense to try to get miles away  from Gia's destructive behavior and crumbling sense of self-worth. She  tries relentlessly to lead Gia astray from her powerful addictions  (promiscuity, heroin, etc.), but loses her fight each time. Her love is  honest and deep, but her will to stay sane is even stronger, and she  eventually walks away later on. Not to mention with a man, which Gia takes  offense to and fuels her fire for her deep-rooted depression and her escape  into the euphoria of intravenous drugs, which ultimately becomes her  demise.<br />It's a sad story to tell, but nevertheless it's told well, and  although you won't be smiling when it's over, you'll be very much impressed  by the acting and the directing. Five stars it is, and this definetely  won't be a waste of money to the person who chooses to buy, lest they  aren't convinced by my gushing review!later on.

B000002UD7|5.0|The 2nd Studio album for the PSB's and it comes across as a much more mature album. With Emotional meaningful tracks like It Couldn't Happen Here and their World-Wide No.1 Its a Sin. This album shows the highlights of the  80's pop music scence wisuch dancy tracks like Heart and it's a sin. This  album has aged rather well, all though its far from NIGHTLIFE as possible  it's still a great album!
B000002UR7|5.0|how could you not like this? it has their first song ever given to us - &quot;you&quot;. aw sweet and things, talking about how you are my sun and moon and stars. it has &quot;creep&quot;. it is their first cd! you can't  go wrong. radiohead is a steadfast and true good band. sure, it's a little  bashy at times, and the radiohead fellows probably cringe at their early  lyrics every now and then, but radiohead is quality. it's also more  accessible than their later ethereal untouchable music. you can almost  imagine they are regular human beans.<br />mmm radiohead.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I think everyone knows that Oops... I Did It Again does not have the strength of her first song Hit Me Baby...One More Time.And the same goes for the album.I must say though that the album does have a much more adult  approach.But to me if she does not get some help quickly this song seems to  mark the end of her career like the Spice Girl's last album Spice Up Your  Life.The album shows a weekness to her. Most pop stars second albums come  out strong like *NSYNC or Backstreet boys, but not hers.I think its only  worth getting the album if you liked the sound to Ginger Spice's new album  or Sporty Spice's new album.If you didnt like any of those then just buy  the single 0ops....I Did it Again.Cause Oops ... I Did it Again is the  closest to a pop sound like her first album really, maybe 2 more songs but  that is really it.And the ballads really have no distinct sound them.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Hello Pearl Jam! How do you feel about all these years of torment,  incomprehension and miscommunication with all these press guys and the  &quot;mind makers&quot; of the world? Fine, I think. You guys did one of  the albuns of the year, free of all kind of confusion, with the pure  essence of rocknroll. Last friday (may,12) I was on the Sony Music Brazil  office listening to Binaural with the others guys from brazilian press.  Wow, this is amazing. Breakerfall reminds me an old MC5 tune. God's Dice  seems sung by Motorhead and all the others tracks shows millions of  references by Who (I Can See For Miles), Beatles (circa 68/69) and  Steppenwolf. Thin Air is an passionate love song, Grievance is perfect.   Well, as the old Sir Jagger used to sing: it's only rocknroll and I  liked. If youre a fan of this band, an exemple of integrity and maturity,  buy Binaural right now.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is, by far, the best material I have seen from Britney. She is soooooooooo hot, talented, and a great preformer. I cannot wait for her new tour! Make sure you get this CD ASAP! It is a great CD to invest in! Well worth the money.
6305079811|4.0|I have no idea why this is one of my favorite movies.  I think it is the fact that this is truly a live-action cartoon.  Bright colors combine with action antics and quasi-futuristic costumes.  Ming the Merciless even has a  plot to take over the universe, that only an Earth football hero can  prevent.  It helps that the characters take themselves seriously without a  hint of intended camp.<br />And of course, the Queen soundtrack.  Queen adds a  bit of integrity to this strange gem of a movie, along with Topol (Fiddler  on the Roof) who is the perfect Dr. Zarkov.  Actually, all of the  characters are well cast.<br />Or maybe it's just the Hawkmen.  Diiiiive!
0380973464|5.0|I didn't really get into Snow Crash, and I loved the Diamond Age, so I figured I had a 50/50 chance of liking this book.<br />And it didn't disappoint at all - I love the way Stephenson jumps around between  plotlines, keeping your interest in the characters and their stories  intact. And I love the detail he goes into (esp wrt the offshore data  haven, the crypto, the war details) - he combined a lot of my favorite  topics into one fascinating novel.
6300246787|3.0|The first time I saw this, I thought it was terrible.  I have never been a Barbara Streisand fan, and this era of musicals was very hit or miss.  However, I was able to see the theatre production a few times and my  opinion was changed.  I guess I just got used to it, and was able to  appreciate it's peculiar flavor.<br />&quot;Hello Dolly&quot; is a bit silly,  with a few catchy tunes.  Some of the tunes were more fleshed out in  &quot;Mame.&quot; It has some great moments that have been strung together  and are worth watching the movie for.  The Louis Armstrong scene is one of  the best.  He brings an instant smile to the movie.  Michael Crawford is a  real scene stealer as Cornielius Hackle.  He and his friend Barnaby are the  most entertaining of the sub plots.  They also get one of the best songs,  &quot;Elegance.&quot;  All of the romances are mismatched, in age, style,  and sheer scale.  Spider-legged Tommy Tune towers over Ermagarde in the  dance scenes, while Cornelius hooks up with a much older/more mature woman.  Walter Mathew is gruff and likeable. Everything is just a little bit off,  which helps contribute to the quirky nature of the film.<br />At the end of  the day, the only disappointment is Dolly herself.  Barbara Streisand is  annoying as the fast talking matchmaker.  It is really the supporting  characters that carry this musical.  But they do so very well.
0805062971|5.0|A great deal of hype has surrounded Chuck Palahniuk's first novel since its publication, reaching its apex in the second half of 1999, when the film version was released. Consequently, it's often been difficult to see  what an incredibly good book &quot;Fight Club&quot; truly is. Finely  written in spare, powerful prose, this slim novel taps into the late  20th-century zeitgeist and expounds on fatherless sons, dehumanization,  office work, materialism, violence, and insanity. If all this sounds rather  heavy and preachy, it's not; at least not most of the time. While there are  a few times in the book when Palahniuk allows his &quot;message&quot; to  supersede his text, for the most part this is an intelligent and very funny  meditation on modern life. While the film was a fine adaptation of the  book, it missed some of the novel's humor amid the bone-crunching violence,  and lost sight of some of its satiric points halfway through. Not only does  the book better explore Americans' uncomfortable relationship with  consumerism and capitalism, it also shows in no uncertain terms how  difficult it is to change the society in which one lives. Truly a great  book.
B000003TAR|5.0|In short, brilliant.  This deliberately difficult album actually contains more memorable songs than it's predecessor.  Never has alienation, fear, boredom, anger and human vulnerability sounded so unsettling and beautiful  at the same time.  With gorgeous, bludgeoning tracks like &quot;Serve The  Servants&quot;, &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Rape Me&quot;,and  the whisper-to-a-roar masterpiece, &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot;, these  songs are not for the faint-hearted.  The bruised beauty of the proceedings  will forever linger in your memory.  This is a fitting epitaph to the  short, often sad, but gifted life of a young musical genius who took  himself from this world far too soon.

B00000JCOV|5.0|Dude, i listened to Korn like everyday, and I couldn't help but like them. They were my favorite band. Now they are my second favorite. I hate slipknot for  making me not listen to Korn. But I love their music. So now, I listen to Slipknot like 3 hours a day. And Korn for like 10  minutes. But enough of that. Their is a lot of great songs. Eyeless is the  best song on their cd. But their first single, Wait and Bleed, really  stands out too. Sic is a good way to begin the Cd. I really dont like track  1. its annoying. But, after that, things kick. Scissors is a great way to  end the cd, along with the hidden track. Its 53 minutes of awesome music.  With 9 people in the band, 2 guitarists, 1 bass player, 1 sampler, 1 DJ, 3  drummers, and a lead singer. The drums make every second of the music  intense. Especially Wait and bleed. So if you like Korn, and you wont get  mad by making Korn your second favorite band, get this cd. But dont get  significant other by Limp Bizkit. Total sellouts. Okay.

B000002UB6|5.0|Arguably the most underrated album of the Beatles career.  Songs such as Let it Be and Get Back are every bit as good as the two best songs off Sgt. Pepper.  As a whole, Let it Be doesn't quite measure up with the Beatles  later day albums.  But it comes close in spite of all the internal  bickering which was going on at the time of this record.  By this time,  McCartney had clearly taken over the reigns of the band.  Lennon was little  more than a semi-interested on looker and Harrison was growing tired of his  junior role within the group.  McCartney's dominance shows in that the  albums four best songs were written by him: Let it Be, Get Back, Long &amp;  Winding Road, and Two of Us.  Lennon does offer some quality with Dig a  Pony and Across the Universe, but of all Beatles albums this is by far his  weakest creatively.  Still an average Beatles album is  better than the  best efforts of most groups and despite the internal friction, Let it Be  offers a unique blend of rock and roll as nature intended(i.e. Get Back,  One after 909) and what could be construed as the beginnings of gospel  rock. (Long &amp; Winding Road, Across the Universe, Let it Be, I Me Mine)   Over the years, much criticism has been directed at Phil Spector for  overproducing the album.  However, listening to the sparse instrumentation  of the Long &amp; Winding Road and the erratic harmonies of Let it Be on  the Anthology shows that Spector was justified in his actions.  Many of the  tracks on the album were actually recorded live proving that even at their  worst, the Beatles could still perform without overdubs.  Perhaps the only  bad thing about the album, other than Lennon's lack of creativity, is the  fact that Dig it and Maggie Mae were even included.  These songs undermine  the album's overall underrated quality
B00004T8RK|4.0|Okay, I'm sick of hearing people say how Pearl Jam have 'lost their edge'.  Sure, Ten was a great album, and at first listen, every song was a killer, right?  But this band HAS evolved and has proven so on every album since  Ten.  Frankly, I'm glad to see any REAL rock music coming out these days.   Bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit call themselves rock, but can hardly live  up to the implications of that catagegory.  Pearl Jam is still keeping rock  alive for all of those true rock fans still out there.  Just because all of  the songs on this album don't catch you right away, don't just toss it  aside.  Give it another listen or two, like I did, and I'm sure you'll find  that this band has not lost their edge at all.  Pearl Jam lives, and thank  god for that.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper was a great album for its time but at best I would only rate it fourth among the Beatles albums.  For me, Abbey Road, The White Album, and Revolver are clearly superior and Pepper is really no better than  Rubber Soul and only slightly better than Let it Be.  Yet, it was the  groups most important and most influential album and is still a classic  even today.  My biggest problem with the album is the lack of rock material  present.  Of course at this time the group was obsessed with doing things  differently and I must admit there are some great momemts, especially the  opening songs and the stunning conclusion, A Day in the Life.  The albums  middle songs, tracks 5-8, do very little for me.  Fixing a Hole, She's  Leaving Home, and Within You and Without You are all throwaway songs  salvaged only by interesting lyrics.  Good Morning Good Morning is a good  rock number ruined by over-zealous use of saxophones while Lucy in the Sky  with Diamonds sounds a little too slow and is hurt by McCartney's high  harmonies in the chorus.  There are the usual catchy numbers, With a Little  Help from My Friends, Getting Better, When I'm 64, and Lovely Rita along  with the title track and reprise which strengthen the album though.   Overall, Sgt. Pepper is probably the only Beatles album (at least in the  later years)that was overhyped.  It is more of a historical work than a  great piece of music, and if you just like rock music, it probably isn't  the album for you: Buy Abbey Road instead.  Yet it is a must for every true  Beatles fan for it captures the group at their absolute most important  moment
B00004T8RK|5.0|the new pearl jam is well worth it.  anyone who says these guys are over are crazy.  track five alone is worth the money.  my favorite by far is &quot;sleight of hand&quot; with the odd 5/4 time signature in the verse.   that had to be new drummer Matt Cameron of Soundgarden's idea. if the last  album &quot;Yield&quot;  let you down, dont worry, binaural wont.  (i liked  yield).  buy this cd!
6305499365|5.0|I fell in love with this movie.  Although I panned it at the box office, I saw it on HBO and was hooked.  A true memorial to the working stiffs of the world...
B00004SCX6|1.0|first she has no talent, second she can't sing, third all the songs are terrible
B00004SCX6|4.0|I dislike contemporary pop music, boy groups and teen queens in particular, but I have to say that this CD was not what I expected.  I bought it because my 16-month old daughter loves to dance to &quot;Oops...I  Did It Again&quot; over and over (and over).  When she was done listening  to this song for an hour I played the whole disc through and have to say,  guiltily, that I like it.  Though the production is a bit too smooth, her  voice is strong and the songs keep you moving.  The remake of &quot;(I  Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; is terrific, and the rest of the CD, if  not exactly memorable is listenable.
078062789X|1.0|This was a horrible waste of money.  It is slow moving, anti-suspense, and uses a very predictable plot that could have been played out and summed up in under 10 minutes.  By the end of this long drawn out snooze-fest, you  are saying to your TV &quot;Please, just die already, just end this  movie&quot;.  If you are bored and it comes onto regular tv, ok, maybe  watch it.  But I wouldn't recommend even paying a $1 rental fee for this  one.
B00002Z88D|1.0|I love Metallica and have since Kill 'em All. So I figured anything they put out would be worth listening to. Well, I was wrong. The concept of a Metal band and an Symphony Orchestra is an intriguing idea, but it just  doesn't work here. Although I think it could work with Metallica, their  song choices with the symphony could have been better. I mean, c'mon M of P  or Battery with violins?  WHO thought THAT was a good idea? <br />Metallica's  music, by it's very nature, has a lot of energy, but the Orchestra seems to  steal this energy.<br />That's my opinion, take it or leave it....
0380796090|5.0|I laughed out loud when I was reading this book, again and again.  It's delightful and charming and touching too.
B00003Q438|5.0|This two-disc DVD package is nothing short of stunning in both it's content and presentation.  20th Century Fox DVDs of late are top class examples of the power of DVD, which put the simple video-to-DVD transfers  which some companies put out to shame. THE ABYSS is a fantastic film and  the ability to choose which version to watch (Theatrical or Special  Edition) is a real boon. The aminated menus are brillant, based on the Moon  Pool part of the rig, an example of which is the selection of the version  of the film to watch. There are two doors - you pick the one for the  version you want to watch. Then before the version you've picked starts a  water tentacle rises up and goes through the door you picked. It's touchs  like that which distinguishes the class from the dross. After watching the  film, there's the second disc. This positively bursts with in-depth  background information: The one-hour documentary &quot;Under Pressure: The  Making of the Abyss&quot; and a supplemental guide containing a mass of  material relating to the film including the original treatment, a shooting  script and every single storyboard! Not to mention all the other stuff (one  of my favourites being the 7 minute time lapse sequence showing the  building and filling of the main Deepcore exterior set). A must for any  serious DVD collector. Essential for any fan of this superb film.
0679805273|5.0|I love this book so much.  I get it for everybody I know who is graduating from college and I read it to my 7 month old baby everyday. It is truely words to live by.
0671015206|5.0|This book is definitely worth a read.  I already suspected there were millionaires hiding all around us, that didn't need to parade their wealth to feel good about themselves.  I also suspected that some people who drive  expensive cars and live in mansions often are one step ahead of their  creditors.  And this book explains why.
0140177396|5.0|I thought that this book was a great book. I thought thatbecause it expressed the feelings of every character in a certain waythat was so real and it made me feel so into the book. THe part where i really got into the book was when Carlson went out and shot Candy's dog and i started talking to the book because i think that that was really rude. I started to cry when i was watching the movie when Carlson shot Candy's dog because candy was with that dog for a long time and i thought that it was really mean that Carlson thought that it would be ok that he shot the dog. Even if the dog is deaf Candy took care of it and didn't let anything happended to it.  He really loved that dog. I also liked how they made Lenny sound so hopeless and how he reacted to the puppy and how he was just like my 6 year old sister. She always comes up to me and says if i do this can you give me something and it is kind of the same as Lenny wanting to tend the rabbits if he did something good...  Lenny did live a hard and wild life including that he always had something going on in his life that got him in trouble. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes short and exciting books read this one. I guarantee you that you will not be disapionted, and if i were you i would run out and buy a copy of the book Of Mice and Men right now.........  Thank You!
0900652985|3.0|For how much the name &quot;Sear&quot; comes up in connection to ancient coins, I had very high expectations for this book. Unfortunately, they weren't quite met. <br />In the edition that I own (2nd), there are not very  many illustrations, except at the end of the book. The rest of the pictures  are just drawings of the coins. I do not know if this was remedied in later  editions, though I don't think that it was.<br />Also, the prices (in British  Pounds) are given in just one grade of each coin.<br />Still, one can judge  from the prices the relative rarity of the coin. Add that to the fact that  this is the book that EVERYONE refers to, that that in itself makes it  quite valuable.<br />A very brief history is given on each emperor or wife.  There also are additional histories on certain periods of Roman history  (The Tetrarchy of Diocletian, for example), which are both helful and  interesting. Equally important is the quick overview of Roman coins found  in the beginning of the book.<br />Sear will cost you a chunk of money, and  while quite helpful, it won't answer your every question. Still, if you are  collecting Roman coins, you need this book, if for no other reason than  that everyone else has it and will quote it.
B000002WYT|4.0|the first time i heard of the Dave Matthews Band was when i was at drama practice and a friend of mine started playing &quot;crash&quot;. i alway loved that song, but never knew who it was by. so, i asked my friend which  dmb cd i should buy first. he told me crash, but i got Under the Table and  Dreaming first. i loved it. then i decided to buy crash. it is the gr8est!  i love Drive In, Drive Out and So Much Too Say. i love this cd and  reccomend it to everyone. although i enjoy UTTAD, this one is a gr8  follow-up!
0792842731|2.0|I am happy to say that even though I did not like this movie all that much, James Bond came back with a much better movie in &quot;The World is not Enough.&quot; The funk that the writers were in during &quot;Tomorrow  Never Dies&quot; was only temporary.<br />&quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; just  wasn't all that interesting. The bad guy did not seem all that bad, and you  just never really got all that emotionaly attached to any of the  characters. For instance, I think we were supposed to feel bad when Terri  Hatcher died, but I just wasn't...she just hadn't contributed anything to  the movie before she was erased.<br />That said, there were some pretty  entertaining action scenes. I particularily liked watching James drive his  BMW via remote while sitting in the back seat. <br />Mildly entertaining,  though not a classic. Pierce did much better in his other 2 Bond movies,  though I wouldn't say that it was he who brought down the level of  &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies.&quot;<br />I'd actually think that this is closer  to a 3-star movie, but since I have such high expectations for James Bond  movies, I lowered it a full star for failing to meet that lofty level.<br />If  you just watched the new movie &quot;The World is not Enough&quot; and are  looking for another great Bond movie to watch, you might want to skip this  one (for now) and see &quot;Goldeneye&quot; first.
0684872153|5.0|Wow - I'm still speechless after reading this book.  When it was described to me, I sort of dreaded it - poverty, hunger, filth, alcoholism - not uplifting topics.  But told by Mr. McCourt in a faithful childlike voice,  these subjects while still grim take on a factual bitterless tone.  Can't  wait to read 'Tis.
B000001EXR|5.0|...[This record] is definitely the most polarized in terms of likeand dislike that I have seen.  For the recond, I loved this record.This is their best album since Creatures, by far.  There are only five studio albums (Live I rules! )that I truly consider classic Kiss and the epitome of this great band: Kiss, Hotter than Hell, Destroyer, Creatures of the Night, and this album.  The four albums that I consider strong but not classic are MFTE, Revenge, Dressed to Kill, and Dynasty.  Every else stunk!  (You heard me right Kiss fans, Love Gun and Rock and Roll Over were not good!   They were lazy efforts that narrow minded Kiss fans ate up during the Kiss craze.  Screaming Love Gun, and I Want You over and over again does not take talent)This album is Kiss at its Musical best.  This album is necessary to see the greatness of this band!
6305372411|5.0|This is a very good set of videos.  They portray the many aspects of the space program showing both its successes and failures as well as the issues faced by NASA at the time.  What I especially enjoyed was the emphasis on  people and their feelings.  All of the episodes were good, but 3 of them  especially stand out in my mind.  First, &quot;The Spider&quot;.  Engineers  are so often perceived as &quot;technogeeks&quot;, but this episode (about  the design of the LEM) showed that feelings and creativity are as much a  part of engineering as art.  Second, &quot;Is That all There Is&quot;.   This episode shows the close friendship and humorous antics of the Apollo  12 astronauts.  So often the human element is ignored in major technical  feats, yet this episode, as told through the eyes of Al Bean, demonstrates  that friendship and fun as well as inspiration are all a part of major  technological  achievements.  The participants in the great acts of history  are not stuffy, unfeeling automatons, but are people like you and me.   Third, &quot;Galileo Was Right&quot;.  In this episode, the astronauts of  Apollo 15 are bored by geology professors teaching them the science they  need for their mission.  But one of the back up crew recruits a former  professor who inspires and touches the lives of these &quot;flying  jocks&quot;.  Again, one sees that human elements like patience,  imagination, perseverence and inspiration are all needed to make technicle  things successful.  And this episode highlights the value of the teaching  profession.  I am very glad to add this set to my video collection.
B00004T8RK|4.0|The boys are well and truely back with this solid album that explores just about every rock music sound that can be imagined, including a ukelele solo by Eddie. No need to panic people, there are plenty of solid pearl jam rock classics on this album that will soon become fan favourites on the upcoming tour and beyond: songs like Breakerfall, Gods Dice, Insignificance, Grievance and Rival. All of these songs really rock and sound like the band has found some new inspiration with drummer Matt Cameron...The album has some really cool ballads as well (Light Years, Thin Air) that give the album a good balance and a mixture of sounds. ...Of The Girl has a really cool groove to it and some great bluesy guitar riffs by Mike. The song never really takes off but sounds very cool nonetheless. Sleight Of Hand is a strange song that I didnt really like at first listen, but it has really grown on me and is now one of my favourites on the album. The chorus parts of this song remind me of Garden from their first album Ten. ...The lyrics of this song show that, yes, Eddie Vedder does infact have a sense of humour. The album then closes very drammatically with Parting Ways which could be described as Long Roads little sister. Matts Wife, April plays Viola on this closing song that I hope is'nt hinting at the bands future...it is a completely solid piece of work that doesn't dissapoint. To categorize the album, it's a combination of the aggressive sounds of Vs. and Vitalogy with some completely new sounds and some elements of Ten and Yield thrown in along the way. <br />My only problem with Binaural is that the production/recording technique ('Binaural' from which the album title came from) used by Tchad Blake seems to work well on the 'lighter' tracks but tends to deflate the 'heavier' rock tracks making them almost sound like they've been recorded under water.<br />For this reason I give it 4 stars and not 5...
B00001OH7M|4.0|Bowie blends glam,folk and science fiction/art school lyrics to good effect on this album.It does not prepare you for anything that would follow later in his career.Rick Wakeman on mellotron is a vital ingredient  throughout the album,which in spots reminds me of the Strawbs.&quot;Space  Oddity&quot; is one of my all time favorites,&quot;Cygnet Committee&quot;  is our first glimpse of David's futuristic vision,musically and  otherwise.&quot;Janine&quot; is a pleasant love song that doesn't get  syrupy.&quot;Free Festival&quot; is a bit of a drag.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This album is better than britney's former one. I don't think you will be disappointed if you are a Britney fan. OK, she does not have the most powerful voice out there, but this album has a really nice beat to it. It  has more of a rought edge than the other one. it reminds me a little of  what Janet jackson did on her CD &quot;The Velvet Rope&quot;. The cover  version of the Stones' &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is quite well done.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I can't believe this.  I was one of the first in line to get this, hoping with anticipation that I wouldn't be disappointed.  I bought it, and came home as soon as I could.  I played it and yes, another incredible album by  the greatest band in the world.  Pearl Jam once again does it. I can't  believe they can do this, every consecutive album is great.  How I could of  expected disappointment, I don't know.  Eddie's voice sound's incredible.   Cameron sounds great on the drums.  Mike, Stone, and Jeff bust out the  fabulous riffs.  The music flows with the lyrics.  To anyone who  understands music, and knows what Pearl Jam is all about, don't pass up on  getting this.  Hail, Hail Binaural
0880389052|5.0|I'm in seventh grade and I'm posting a review about Homeland for a book report. Homeland is a great book by R.A. Salvatore, one of my favorite authors. It is a compelling novel about a Drow Elf named Drizzt. I liked how it showed good versus evil but in an original way, and how detailed and  exciting the fights were. The one thing I liked best is reading more about  Drow Elves who are the best fantasy race in my opinion. I would reccomend  this book to anyone who likes an exciting storyline and interesting fights.
B000000WG4|5.0|This music is astonishing. There's no other way to describe it. It consists of two parts/tracks. The first is immensely powerful. It is sweet and wild, everything a rock-lover could wish for. Part two is even better.  Somehow it reminds me of the beginning of Ovid's Metamorphoses. Mike  Oldfield is a true musical genius. He succeeds in blending hard rock with  classical music. It is really impressive.
0451527046|4.0|I read the book Treasure Island. At first the book was hard to get but as I went farther in the book it got easier. At the start of of the book. Jim and his mom owned a bed and breakfast.One of the customers was the Captain  and he had a lot of treasure. A sailor named Blackdog killed the Captain  and looked for the treasure but couldn't find it. Jim took the treasure and  went to the town doctor's house. When the other pirates came Jim and the  doctor left on the ship, Hisponolia.
B000000I0D|5.0|this album is really worth the money you pay for it. you'll never get bored of it, i promise. the first track is a nice instrumental that is wild at times and very gentle and pleasant at others. i know this description is  corny, but you've got the hear this work of art to appreciate its beauty.  it is pure emotion. the other tracks (all with lyrics except for taurus 3)  are heart-breakingly haunting, especially 'moonlight shadow' (which was  inspired by john lennon's untimely and violent death). the melody of this  song doesn't let you go and will haunt you for ever (in a pleasant way). i  think mike oldfield is one of the best and most talented musicians around.  buy this album, you won't regret it.
B000003N7K|5.0|I bought this CD years ago, having long been a fan of John Coltrane. As I debated with my daughter (who worked at the record store) about Coltrane's never having recorded with a vocalist before or since that time, a stranger  who overheard us leaned over the bins and said, &quot;Just BUY it!  It's  WONDERFUL! &quot; So - I did, and it is my absolute FAVORITE John Coltrane  recording! Esquire Magazine reviewed this CD about 10 years ago (or more),  and said it was probably the best jazz recording ever made! It said Johnny  Hartman rose to the occasion and never made as fine a recording ever again  in his career. Hartman was Coltrane's personal choice as vocalist, and the  recording was made in a single day! Talk about all planets in alignment!  &quot;My One and Only Love&quot; is my husband's and my &quot;special  song&quot;, and it ever will be. This is truly a once in a lifetime  experience. I would recommend this as REQUIRED LISTENING for anyone who  calls himself a true jazz aficionado!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney has just outdone herself w/this one!  This CD is a must have...its just....the BOMB!  Even if you only usually listen to Hip Hop/R&amp;B you  will love this! Although the whole CD is tight, the best songs are(in my  opinion): Oops, I Did It Again, Strong, Don't Go Knocking On My Door, Don't  Let Me Be The Last To Know &amp; What You See.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I have been a Pearl Jam fan since the beginning, so my opinion may be just a slight bit biased, but I feel that PJ's latest does a good job of showing that Pearl Jam always knows how to sound fresh, yet still sounds like  themselves at the same time.  Ex Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron really  adds a great element to the overall sound of this disc, as he really seems  to understand the feel that Pearl Jam is looking for, possibly even a  little better than Irons did.  This record is heard best when played loud,  as that is what truly recreates the incredible live sound that the band  has, and allows the listener to fully capture the sonic details and energy  that this band is fully capable of.  I feel that this album, as well as the  last two, have Pearl Jam making a transition from a song oriented band to  an album oriented one, much along the lines of Led Zeppelin.  That's not to  say that the songs aren't great, as some of Pearl Jam's best and most  emotional work can be found here, especially &quot;Light Years&quot;, the  chilling &quot;Nothing as it seems&quot;, &quot;Insignificance&quot;,  &quot;Of The Girl&quot;, &quot;Breakerfall&quot; as well as the pleasant  &quot;Parting Ways,&quot; which is the bands most most affecting  pseudo-ballad (for me at least) since &quot;Release&quot;.  Fans searching  for the next &quot;Jeremy&quot; or &quot;Alive&quot; may feel a bit let  down, as the band has definitely grown up, but I HIGHLY recommend this to  any fan who appreciates the bands maturing sound as well as anybody who  appreciates great rock music in general.  Bravo Pearl Jam!   Keep the  great records coming!
B000002L42|5.0|When word came out that Becker and Fagen had indeed rejoined forces to actually tour, we were amazed, to say the least. Who would have expected that to happen? Anyhow, when they were asked as to why they would suddenly  break with an almost lifelong habit of not touring, they said: Because we  wanted to know what Babylon Sisters would sound like when played live.  <br />Well, here we have it. And it sounds great. Slower even than the famous  studio version, but just as impeccable and with a nice change in timbre.  The rest of the disc (including such jewels as Third World Man, Aja, Kid  Charlemagne) is equally impressive. These guys can really play, it wasn't  all studio trickery what we heard back then!<br />Special mention deserves  Reeling in the Years: surprising arrangement, superbly executed. I just  can't believe they did it. And with such style at that.
B00004T8RK|4.0|With their sixth studio album, Pearl Jam's always evolutionary sound shows no signs of stagnating.  &quot;Binaural&quot; is  a strikingly   different album from a band known for strikingly different albums.  But this is  really different.  For instance, take the first   single, &quot;Nothing as  it Seems.&quot;  With its dirge-like beat and mournful guitars, the song is  perhaps the most downbeat Pearl Jam   has ever recorded.  Not that there's  anything wrong with that.  Indeed, for all its sense of hoplessness,  there's some great   music in there.  This is a song that, like so much  Rock, would be great to listen to while high.  Another, less successful,    departure is &quot;Evacuation.&quot;  With music supplied by former  Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, it just dosen't sound like a   Pearl Jam  song.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but with this song it is; its  probably the weakest song on the album.   On   the other hand, the stongest  track is &quot;Light Years,&quot; a poetic song that showcases Pearl Jam at  its best, Ed Vedder's stirring   lyrics juxtaposed with the band's solid  musicianship.  &quot;We were but stones/Your light made us stars&quot;. . .  maybe one of the best   lines Vedder has written.  &quot;Thin Air,&quot; a  song that recalls the Beatles and maybe even Big Star, approaches this  brilliance.  &quot;Of   the Girl,&quot; also has this late 60's - 70's vibe  to it, maybe Simon and Garfunkel meets &quot;Abbey Road&quot;-era Beatles.   Other   stand-outs include &quot;Soon Forget,&quot; featuring Ed Vedder  solo on ukelele of all things; &quot;Insignificance,&quot; the B-side to  &quot;Nothing as   it Seems;&quot; and &quot;God's Dice,&quot; probably the  best rocker on the album.        On the whole, this is a great album.   There are a few low points (&quot;Breakerfall,&quot;  &quot;Grievance&quot;), but even they are not soooo   low.  But then again,   don't expect another &quot;Yield&quot; or a throwback to &quot;Ten&quot;  or&quot;Vs.&quot;  Be prepared for a very different Pearl   Jam sound.   Or, put another way, be prepared for more of the same old evolution from  Pearl Jam.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This CD is not as good as I believe! I won't recommend it to my friends! &quot;Oop! I did it again&quot; is too similar to &quot;Baby one more time&quot;! Just listen to the old CD! Wait for next time!
B00004T8RK|4.0|This is a surprisingly bland effort by a band that is more talented than &quot;Binaural&quot; reveals. That is not to say that the entire album is a wash, and critics who continue to demand more &quot;Ten's&quot; are narrow  mindedly ignoring Pearl Jam's moderately successful fight against artistic  stagnancy.<br />The first track is absolutely brilliant and as raucous as  Pearl Jam gets, but from that point the band simply leans on the cliche's  they invented, as the album  predictably descends into the sort of hyper  rock that exhaustingly takes up so much space on Pearl Jam albums ever  since 1993's &quot;VS.&quot; &quot;God's Dice&quot; and  &quot;Evacuation&quot; offer screaming and noise that goes absolutely  nowhhere. The mellower sound of &quot;Light Years&quot; allows the listener  to take a breather, but it too is bland and aimless.<br />&quot;Nothing As it  Seems,&quot; however, proves that Pearl Jam still has some musical  exploration to do. It is perhaps the most haunting track the band has put  to tape; the drone of an acoustic guitar supports Vedder's eerie croon like  a crutch, and the dark, bluesy guitar licks drive the song home with  memorable power. It sounds like something recorded from the grave.  &quot;Thin Air&quot; is a beautiful acoustic piece, and some may recognize  Led Zepplin's &quot;Babe I'm Gonna Leave You&quot; lurking beneath the  surface of the rollicking &quot;Insignificance.&quot;<br />The much quieter  second half of &quot;Binaural&quot; delivers flickers of the brilliance  that is rightfully expected of Pearl Jam, but flickers are not enough to  salvage the album from its blandness. The eukelele tune is as interesting  as it is baffling, &quot;Of The Girl&quot; is arguably the most accessible  track of the album's subdued side, but &quot;Binaural&quot; simply fizzles  out like a dim light bulb.<br />Ironically, the album's most outstanding  feature is Matt Cameron's ferocious drumming that pounds through each song  and contributes a thick layer of atmosphere.<br />For seasoned Pearl Jam  fans, there just may be enough here to provide a reasonable amount of  satisfaction, but the more casual fans may justifiably dismiss this album  as an unfortunately unambitious effort by a more capable group. As  always...maybe next time, folks.ibutes a thick layer of atmosphere. <br />For seasoned Pearl Jam  fans, there just may be enough here to provide a reasonable amount of  satisfaction, but the more casual fans may justifiably dismiss this album  as an unfortunately unambitious effort by a more capable group.

B000002B30|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is one of the greatest Rock artists of all time. He has released many incredible albums, including Born To Run, which is one of the greatest albums of all time. The Boss has been around for almost 30 years  now, and he is still going strong. This CD covers most of his best stuff.  It is missing songs from his first two albums, which were comercial flops,  but great albums. I would have included Rosalita, Growin' Up, Spirits In  The Night, and Sandy instead of the last three songs and Better Days. The  last three songs are all new songs, that are very good, but not up to par  with alot of his other songs. Other than this, the CD is perfect. It  contains alot of his best songs, and although I would reccomend getting  more than one of his CDs, this would be the one to own.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Sure, Ten is and always will be pearl Jam's best album, but Binaural is pretty close.  The group sounds every bit as good as ever and now with Matt Cameron, the former Soundgarden drummer, on the drums they are even better.   Eddie Vedder still mixes in his enormous talent and his voice is as good  as ever.  &quot;Insignificance&quot;, &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot;, and  &quot;Light Years&quot; are all excellent tracks.

B00004T8RK|3.0|From the early 90's to now Pearl Jam has done a complete 180 in style. In the beginning, Pearl Jam had a hard rock edge and catchy vocals. Now they are ALL vocals. The last 3 albums ive noticed this small change in their  music. This album and Yield, are really close in vocalistic rythems.  Normally Pearl Jam has catchy, rock hard couruses, but now their couruses  are made up of Vedder's, poetic voice. A couple good songs, but nothing I'd  like to hear from the once great Pearl Jam.
0553573403|5.0|I really don't read books like A Game Of Thrones often.  I think it is because I cant find a book as good as it.  I might be a little too young for some of the ummm things in it.  But I loved the plot and char. I was up  till late at night reading A Game Of Thrones.  It did take me a long week  to read the book. But it was very exciting and I think YOU should read it!  It was a very complicated plot.  I had to go to the back of the book a lot  so I could remember who was who.  The book ended in the middle of a war  between two houses so now I HAVE to get the next book!
B00003RQNJ|5.0|This DVD duplicates the laserdisc edition released a couple of years ago. The extras are basically the same. What's different and makes this worthwhile? The transfer is superior to the laserdisc and the AC-3 mixed  sound is spectacular (when compared to both the laser and video  edtions).<br />Is it worth purchasing again? Most definitely as the user menu  is very friendly making this a joy to navigate through. Easily one of the  ten greatest films produced during the 60's (and yes, that bike sequence is  dated...but still has charm although it runs on a bit too long), this is  one of William Goldman's best scripts, well directed by Hill and  photographed by Hall. Highly recommended.

B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam's sixth studio album is essentially a continuation of where they left off with &quot;Yield.&quot; Its got raw rockers (e.g. &quot;grievance&quot;) lilting ballads (&quot;sleight of hand&quot;) and  even typical P.J. oddball songs like the solo-Vedder &quot;Soon  Forget.&quot;    The first half is more polished than P.J.'s usual raw  sound, but the second half is usual  &quot;difficult-to-digest-at-first&quot; Pearl Jam.   The album is not  GREAT enough to warrant five stars. However, unlike past Pearl Jam albums,  it has no major flaws (e.g. &quot;bugs&quot; on Vitalogy). Definitely a  strong album which would be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Yup, Britney did it &quot;one more time.&quot; If you jave her old c.d., get this one. It's more mature (according to her) and the songs are fun to listen to and sing along.
0783240503|1.0|This movie is not worth the cash it takes to get it, a terribleshowing of the original story -- it almost makes fun of it. It doesall people in it injustice. If your looking for something that gets the bang for for buck, this isn't it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is a great follow-up to &quot;Baby One More Time.&quot; I love the new song, &quot;Oops,&quot; and &quot;Stronger,&quot; &quot;I Can't Get No Satisfaction,&quot; and &quot;When your Eyes Say it&quot; are all  incredible.  I will need a few more listens but I'd definitely say this one  is AS good as BOMT, if not better.  If you love great pop music, this is  pop music at its finest!  No one does it better than Britney Spears.  She  sure showed what trash Christina Aguilera is with this album.  It's so much  classier than anything Christina could ever come up with!  Anyway, you  should get this cd ASAP, it's wonderful.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Binaural is a mix of the new sound of Pearl Jam with the drummer Matt Cameron.  It's great to hear Eddie playing different instruments like the ukele.  Somehow pj sounds traditional in this age of boy groups and pop  music. In 1998 they released the album Yield.  Songs like In Hiding, and  Given To Fly were ballads that showed off the mild rocking side of pj.  Now  on Binaural, you have songs like Breakerfall and Light Years that have  simmilar rocking styles. Nothing as it seems, gives off the a Pink Floyd  sounding background guitar by Mcready.  Overall after listening to the new  album twice it has grown on me!
B00004SCX6|1.0|This must be the worst CD of 2000. Congratuations, Britney, for producing the worst CDs known to us. She doesn't know how to sing at all and now she says her voice is more mature. Give me a break, her voice is much more  disgusting than the last time. I feel like she's screaming everytime I hear  her music.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I liked this CD. IT had some pretty good songs and it will no doubt jump to #1. But I don't reaaly know if it would do better than ....Baby One More Time. There wasn't much sweet songs like From the bottom of my broken Heart  in this album but instead have more upbeat songs. There were a few sweet  songs and the rest were more funkier. If you like (You Drive Me) Crazy,  you'll totally love this CD! If you don't, its still good. Definately get  it!
6302378648|4.0|Cape Fear is a wonderful murder flick! Nick Nolte plays a North Carolina lawyer who defended a convicted felon. He lost the case and Nolte's client Max Cady(De Niro)goes to jail. When he is released Cady terorizes Nolte and  his family, Jessica Lange his wife and Julitte Lewis daughter. After being  harrased and pursued by Cady enough the family escapes to North Carolina's  real life location Cape Fear for and exciting climax. The film goes off  course some and does kind of get boring but it really is worth it! I've  liked this since I saw it for the first time when I was much youger. The  theme is amazing! And De Niro's performance is not to be missed.
6303686796|2.0|I just don't get it! I wanted to love this movie. Maybe I had to see this movie at the theatre as an adult back when it was first released? At any rate, my opinion is that it simply stinks.<br />Of course DeNiro is compelling  and interesting, but I felt no sympathy for any of the characters in this  movie. Jodi Foster is often lauded for her role in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;  but I don't see why. It was small and one dimensional and (I feel) not  particularly well acted. And Cybil Shepard? Give me a break! Lousy acting  can never be covered up with a soft focus lens. I did like Albert Brooks,  however.<br />And the ending? What is that all about? It makes no sense, has  no logic and is not even profound (which it must be if logic is thrown out  the window). Just when this movie should've been over there is another 15  minutes tacked on that should've been left on the cutting room floor. It is  almost as if the studio exec's said, &quot;Hey, uh, Marty? That ending is  too gruesome and unresolved. How about tidying it up nice and neat for us,  eh?&quot;<br />I like many of Scorsese's movies (especially &quot;Good  Fellas&quot;), and of course I always enjoy De Niro's acting, but I found  no redeeming value in &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. I think one had to see it  back when it was first released to appreciate it. Otherwise it is dated,  poorly written, and ultimately pointless.
B000000H5J|5.0|The King's of Cybermetal, Fear Factory, came out with this fine opus of pure cybermetal. Burton C. Bell intelligently left his death metal growl behind and properly showed us what a fine voice he carries. With songs like Replica, Pisschrist, and the title track, Fear Factory has already cornered the cybermetal genre. Where the band truly outdoes itself is in the monster track Zero Signal. With this song, Fear Factory sowed the seeds of this brand of music forever.
6305308659|5.0|This movie expands, shatters and rebuilds the limits in as little as two hours. This movie combines more of everything that no movie's ever touched: two cultures (90's and 50's), two formats (Color and B&amp;W), two genres  (Comedy and Drama) and two great actors (Tobey Maguire and Reese  Witherspoon). And the results are very realistic and booming, all proposed  by writer Gary Ross. You've never seen a movie like this, and you never  will. If you like movies that break all the limits, see Pleasantville.
0380788624|5.0|In this new work, Stephenson combines the wit in Snow Crash to the intelligence in Diamond Age to provide a true pleasure to read.  He supplements his dry humor with detailed and well-researched information  that echoes his cyberpunk novels, but is a far cry from that.  All in all,  he enters new territory and succeeds impressively.
B0000024SI|1.0|If this is &quot;a great statement by the &quot;poet of the times,&quot; are we ever in trouble!  Absurd lyrics about siameses cats, laundry mats, Quizimodo, Einstein being Robin Hood, drainpipes... some clown blowing a  whistle thruout the title song, some wheezy harmonica blowing thruout, and  lest we forget, Dylan doesn't sing, he drones! How  any sane person can  defend this lunacy is beyond me. There are a great many 5 star albums out  there by other artists, but this is a joke!
6305171769|1.0|I am a big fan of the first Halloween. It's my favorite horror movie (that and The Shining) I liked the second one too. This movie absolutely does not do the series justice. It wasn't scary at all but was in fact stupid and  boring! I was so disappointed. Don't waste your money on this one. Good  thing I only rented it!
0880381736|5.0|The enormous Dragonlance saga began with the well-earned success of this first book of the Chronicles trilogy.  It quickly establishes a set of central characters so interesting, yet completely different from each  other, you'll remember them clearly years afterwards at the mere mention of  their names.<br />This novel is blessed with the best comic relief  (Tasselhoff, the perfect innocent) and most intense, complex magic-user  (Raistlin) I've yet encountered.  'Autumn Twilight' is almost imcomparable  for its unusual combination of relentless comic-book action while producing  such fantastic character development.  <br />More descriptive violence than  necessary, but quick paced reading, vivid scenes, wonderful shifts between  light and dark tone, not to mention its unforgettable characters, easily  earn this book five stars.
B00000JCB2|1.0|This is a disgrace to rock.  Songs that talk about taking chainsaws to people and references to sex is not music.  The fact that they showed up at Woodstock, a peace concert, and played &quot;Break Stuff&quot; is just  disgraceful.  It will not live in the annals of rock history, but the anus  of rock history.  <br />Skip it unless you are a parent-revolting,  headbanging, pathetic lowlife pothead that digs this trash.<br />Amazon.com  should allow you to give an album 0 stars.  This would've been a great  album to exercise that.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Although my kids made me buy this CD, I have a confession to make--the title song, &quot;Oops, I Did it Again,&quot; charmed me. A little.<br />Even so, skip this CD if you bore quickly, no matter how much you like the title  tune. You'll find that every other track contains a lot more of the  same--same beat, same harmonies, same overwrought, over-produced bubble gum  pop we've come to expect from baby funksters like Spears. One listen to  this CD and I found myself wondering what the &quot;real&quot; Britney  Spears sounded like, without all the electronic melodrama.<br />It's also a  little difficult to get past songs that are clearly a little more mature  than their intended audience, with lyrics that promote game-playing and  teasing (and no, I'm not talking about the pre-adolescent, &quot;Nyah  nyah!&quot; sort of &quot;teasing&quot;). Plus, a few unabashedly sexy  videos and one breast augmentation later, this little diva still has the  nerve to whine that although she's a Hollywood girl and a big star, her  empty life renders her anything but &quot;Lucky.&quot;<br />Someday, perhaps  if the record label lets Britney grow up musically, this little girl will  be more than just a passing pop fad--but I wouldn't count on it.
B000006TRV|5.0|why is this album constantly being remastered and repackaged?  It should be called the rererererererererererererereremastered version.
B00001ZULV|5.0|Covering 1973 to 1999, this is probably one of the best compilations of the works of Genesis, in all of its forms.<br />As someone mentioned, this is a &quot;HITS&quot; album, not a &quot;Best Of&quot;.<br />Still, for those  Genesis fans who are unfamiliar with the earlier work with Steve Hackett  and Peter Gabriel, this is a great introduction to their works.  And for  those older fans, it gives them a second chance to see if they like the  direction the band went after they became a trio.<br />Since I am a fan of  both Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins, I tend to ride the line between  &quot;prog rock&quot; versus &quot;pop rock&quot; Genesis.<br />The real treat  for me, however, is Carpet Crawlers 1999.  This was a great remake of a  lesser known track from the Lamb album, though it's an appropriate closer  to this album.<br />It leaves fans like me to only imagine the great work they  could do if they were back together for a whole album.<br />If you like  &quot;I know what I like&quot; and &quot;Carpet Crawlers 1999&quot;, I  highly recommend you take the plunge and check out Selling England By The  Pound.  If you enjoy that album, get The Lamb, Foxtrot and Nursery Chryme.   You'll be in for a real treat.<br />Once you get through this compilation, you  will realize that Genesis was a sum of it's parts:  a tight band of  incredible artists.  No matter what, the band lived on and grew.<br />Enjoy  this album.  It's well worth it.
B000002MP2|5.0|...Dookie was the album that made Green Day one of the first mainstream punk bands and eventually paved the way for punk sellouts like Blink 182 and the Offspring.<br />Dookie is probably one of Green Day's brightests  achievements and undoubtly their first commerical success.  Pop-punk  classics like 'Basket Case' and 'When i come around' are Dookie's big  singles.  <br />But this record is just packed with essential and quality punk  tunes, from beginning to end.  Noteable are 'Welcome to Paradise,' 'Having  A blast,' 'In the End,' etc. <br />Highly recommend for any punk or mainstream  alt fan....
B00004SCX6|5.0|I think this album is really kewl. It has a whole bunch of new songs blended together that make the album lost of fun 2 listen 2. The lyrix are great, and I luv the song &quot;Lucky&quot;! Well that's about all I wanted  2 say. Ciao!
B000002N2P|3.0|...I had great expectations for Insomiac, but sadly i was disappointed with Green Day's second major debut album.<br />Overall, Insomiac basically is a continuation of Dookie execpt a little less energitic and less  powerful.<br />However, 'Geek STink Breath' and 'Brain Stew' eventually became  relatively successful singles.  I found the overall album not extremely  impressive and at times boring.<br />If you want a good Green Day album get  Dookie or Nimrod...
0425173895|5.0|This was one of the best Agatha Christie books I've read so far. The beginning was good and as soon as the murder was committed, I really wanted to know who did it. I read most of the book in one day because I really  wanted to get to the ending. If you read this book, once you find out who  the murderer was, you will be completely shocked! This book had a great  solution and you should definitely read it.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I did not buy this album, but I heard every song from NApster, and frankly she cannot sing. If had a southern accent I could sing just like her, and I'm a guy. In Oops... I did it again I could tell her voice computer  changer because when I heard her live on britney's First Listen on MTV, she  sounded horrible and no where near the way she sounds on her album, which  also sounds pretty bad. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone. And  what's uo with the songs, except for &quot;Dear Diary&quot; none of her  songs have real true meaning that a person can actually relate to. These  songs have no emotional premisis whatsoever. I try to stay open minded  about Britney, nut she has no singing talent and i sincerly bothers me that  guys only buy her CD because she's hot and girl's buy it to dance. nobody  actually pays attention to the voice or the words. Anyone could sing  britnry' songs cause they're meaningless and you can't barely hear her sing  with the background sound (thank god! ). I wish she would just learn how  to sing with high notes and emotion like Mandy Moore (her new album I  highly recommend) or with expression like CHristina Aguilera (another album  I reommend). SO if you're looking for a sing WITH TALENT, DON&quot;T BUY  BRITNEY. BRITNEY = NO TALENT. ALOT OF TALENT = MANDY MOORE. TALENT =  CHRISTINA AGUILERA!  I really recommend MAndy Moore's &quot;I wanna e wiht  you&quot; CD. If you don't believe, check iot out yourself.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I gave this album two stars because it contains two good songs-- the title track, and the Rolling Stones remake. The rest of it is very forgettable at best. Britney's last album lacked strong vocals, but at least it had a high  percentage of rather catchy tunes that went over well despite her lack of  vocal prowess. The songs on &quot;Oops&quot; are bland at best, and the  annoying dialogue between songs is enough to destroy any hint of artistic  merit lurking somewhere on this album.
B00004SCX6|5.0|this is a great album and im sure she will get some of the r&amp;b fans on this one! SHe has grown vocally on the new album and proves that she can sing! Most of the songs have a harder r&amp;b edge and are not so popish.  My favorite song is &quot;what you see&quot; where she talks back against  rumors. I say this album takes her out of the one hit wonder land into  superstar diva!  She has totally changed her music style and is not formula  according to the reviewer mistermaxx who obviously hasnt listened to the  album but relies on web samples to critique ms. spears anyway go get the  album you won't be disapointed!
0790729628|4.0|The one word that I very quickly associate with the directors cut of Blade Runner is, WOW!  After having seen the original movie, I thought it was so-so, and I was really annoyed at being told the story by Harrison Ford's  character, the choice to eliminate the voice-over was very  intelligent.<br />The movie follows a detective-type character (a blade  runner) in this case, as he chases down a gang of escaped killer  androids(or replicants).  However, during the process of tracking the  replicants, our blade runner begins to uncover a disturbing truth about  himself and those others around him.<br />The unicorn dream sequence that was  added definetly added to the overall effect of the movie, the effect was  absolutely jaw dropping.  Such a clear message presented in such an  abstract way.<br />The only thing that I would fault with this movie is the  quality of the sound editing, I found that sometimes the voices could have  used some jumping to contrast the sometimes very loud background  music.<br />Overall however, I would highly recommend this DVD to any avid  sci-fi DVD collector, and I think it did a respectable job basing itself  off of Phillip Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Will Britney Spears do it again? The answer: Not with this album. The title song Oops!...I Did It Again is okay, but every other song on the album sounds exactly like it. On the few that don't, such as her ballads  and Satisfaction (I Can't Get No) her voice is strained as she struggles to  make the high notes. She doesn't have the voice for anything that's not  computer-enhanced like most her songs, so she shouldn't screw up perfectly  good songs trying to sing them.
630575067X|4.0|Star Wars: Episode 1-The Phantom Menace<br /> Star Wars: Episode One has lived up to its summer hype.  It is just as  good, if not better than the original three in the series.  The special  effects are fantastic, it has a  great storyline, and the acting is stupendous, and it's an all out great  movie.  Naboo is in danger from the Federation, and it's up to two Jedi  Masters and a young slave named Anakin Skywalker to save Naboo.  Most of  the movie takes place on Naboo where Qui Gonn Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi meet  up with a Gungan named Jar Jar Binks.  It also takes place on Tatooine, a  desert planet ruled by Jabba the Hutt, free of the Federation.  Anakin's  only way to be free is to win a podrace, and to gain new parts for the  Jedis' broken ship to get off the planet.  One great thing about Star  Wars is the acting.  Everyone in the movie acts wonderfully, and makes the  movie a lot more enjoyable.  It must take a lot of talent to do all that.   Episode One is very realistic with the battles, and the CGI animated  characters.  The lightsaber scenes were absoulutely terrific.  I've never  seen so much action in five short minutes.  The only down  part of the  movie was how Qui-Gon and Darth Maul died.  Both died while thir hands were  in the air.  How could two Jedi Masters be so stupid to lift their arms  into the air in the middle of a huge fight?  It just boggles the mind.   George lucas went a little overboard with the CGI.  Jar-Jar Binks seemed  cool at first, but it was a bit carried away later in the movie.  Episode  one is geared toward all ages, even if you aren't a Star Wars fan.  There's  also a bit too much humor too.  The podracer sequence was sweet.  Once  again, a bit too humorous.  When Ben Quadrinarous' podracer blew up, it had  great effects put into it, but it was more childish.  I liked the rest just  fine.  it was full of suspense.  Overall, I'd give Star Wars: Episode 1  a 4 out of 5 star rating.  The reason being the humor.  Many parts were  very serious, but the humor and action just didn't blend.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops... Is a wonderful follow up to ...Baby One More Time.  Of the 12 songs, 10 are great and two are merely OK.  The best songs being: &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;Oops...&quot;,&quot;Dont let  Me Be the Last To Know&quot;, and &quot;What U See(Is What U Get).  And the  remake of &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is actually good.  The subject matter is  much more varied than Britney's first album.  A must own for both Britney  fans and nonfans.
0783244320|5.0|I am VERY picky about my movies. This is the perfect satire for all Star Trek shows and it's fans; it is flawless. Tim Alan does a perfect Bill Shatner at all times. Solid storyline &amp; continuity. A MUST for Trekors  collections. Other sleepers I suggest you check out are &quot;Joe's  Apartment&quot; and &quot;Defending Your Life&quot;.
B0000028VT|5.0|This was the first album, from any artist, that I ever bought on the release date. And it certainly was worth the trouble. This album builds on Mariah's vocal strengths and delivers a powerful, romantic feel. Gone are  the dog-whistle shrieks that were growing annoying by this time (1993); it  is all about a good, tasteful (something not too common in Mariah's  catalog) use of Mariah's entire vocal range.<br />&quot;Hero&quot; is a very  powerful inspirational song, and the stories of &quot;I was on the brink of  suicide when I heard this song and got the courage to live&quot; are so  common they border on being cliches now. &quot;Without You&quot; is my  other favorite track; it was a favorite song of mine beforehand, and I was  pleased to hear a good Mariah rendition of it. &quot;Without You&quot;  sadly did not top the charts in the US, but it did in most countries and  really cemented Mariah as an international superstar, ensuring that  whenever I travel abroad, I can expect to hear Mariah's voice (from  occasionally to constantly).<br />My only gripe is that Mariah has a tendency  to overwork the vocal delivery in the studio albums. I do get jaded with  some of the tracks in this album, and also when I listen to it repeatedly.  But listen to the live versions of the same songs (or better yet, just bite  the bullet and go to a concert), and all of a sudden Mariah's voice comes  across as fuller, more natural, more emotional, and more powerful. I could  be yawning through most of this album, but play a live version of  &quot;Hero&quot; or &quot;Without You,&quot; and I'll burst into tears. And  as mentioned in another review, &quot;Everything Fades Away&quot; found in  non-US releases is a gem in itself.<br />Too bad Mariah no longer delivers  work of this caliber today, concentrating on cheesy teeny bopper hits  instead.
6303187064|5.0|I really can't praise this movie enough. It is just the ideal movie. It was so pure and it really took you to a higher level thjat most movies just can't. Even though it is considered a &quot;goth&quot; classic, people of  any type will love this. It is a classic story about revenge and love and  really puts your small problems into perspective. It made me think.
B00003003R|5.0|This album is great, and does not just work as a greatest hits collection as some might claim.  When I bought it, I didn't expect anything new or different from their albums, but was just desperate for new Guns n' Roses  stuff.  I turned out being really surprised at how great this stuff is.   Every song is different or better than its original version except for  Sweet Child o' Mine and Paradise City which were the lone downpoints.  Your  Crazy is at least ten times better than on Appetite, and Welcome to the  Jungle is simply unbelievable.  No song isn't worth listening to, and this  album is just as great for diehard GNR fans as someone looking for a  Greatest Hits Collection.
630281474X|5.0|My favorite horror movie of all time--probably my favorite film period--is this classic Hammer horror film.  I like this picture so much because it captures the spirit of Stoker's novel better than any other version.   Dracula is portrayed as a ruthless, sexual predator--he is not just a  mysterious nobleman ala Lugosi or (even further off the mark) a tragic  romantic hero ala Langella, et al.  Christopher Lee makes the most out of  his six minutes of screentime, and Peter Cushing is great as the heroic Dr.  Van Helsing.  I also like Michael (Alfred in BATMAN) Gough and the gorgeous  Valerie Gaunt.  James Bernard's music is terrific, the best ever in a  horror picture; and can anything top the wonderful finale?  Don't miss  HOD!
B00003CXDV|5.0|This is the movie STAR WARS: EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE should have been!  It's fun, it's fast, it's exciting.  Even my wife, who doesn't usually like science fiction, said it was a &quot;cute&quot; film, and  that's high praise from her!  It's hard to believe it's only an hour and a  half long with all the stuff that's happening. The cast is excellent, but I  think Tim Allen is beginning to show himself as an excellent actor and not  just his clumsy grunting Tim Taylor alter ego.  Hey, George Lucas!  You  reading this?  Watch Galaxy Quest and see where you went wrong!
B00004T8RK|3.0|First, I love PJ.  Always will.  Next, this album lets us know that Eddie still is not happy on a basic level.  To me, the last insert in the booklet, 'Writer's Block', is evidence of this.  The angst is there,  searching for inspiration.  At one far end of the spectrum, Its my feel as  though Eddie is punishing his record label with low sales, but my real take  on this album is uninspiration.  Guess I'll leave it at that.  Bear with  them...
B00004SCX6|5.0|yep, Britney is hot. Thas about it. Her music is really catchy too. I heard her Oops song at Prom last weekend. Its a good song.
B0000025IE|5.0|This is simple. British Steel is the best album of the Heavy Metal 80s era, hard to believe it is 20 years old now. I first bought this album when it was released in 1980 (I was 14), I recently bought the CD, the songs  still sound powerful, you can easily damage your hearing cranking each tune  louder and louder. No cheesy sythesizers here. I only wish a digital  remastered version was available. I am a big fan of American bands, Ted  Nugent, Aerosmith, Blue Oyster Cult ect..but Judas Priest set the benchmark  with this one, and all that followed fell short. This is a must have CD for  Rockers, it will blow your head off!
B000023X9W|4.0|The tunes seem plain.  The lyrics are plain except for the howlers ('my software's not compatible with you').  The ideas seem miniature like a soothing James Taylor record.  His voice reaches for surprisingly high  notes, never with much strength.  That's the first impression; a couple  more listens later I'm asking myself why I keep playing it.  Either Neil's  a habit or this is a pretty strong effort, about what you'd expect after  his longest ever layoff.  I guess it's the sincerity of it all that's  winning and disarming.  I still think 'Razor Love' is a weak song and  'Buffalo Springfield Again' is dull.  Everything else on the record is rock  solid.  As always Neil follows his muse wherever she leads.  This time  she's going home and home is pretty inviting.  I wish that Emmylou Harris  had sung more of the high notes and that co-producer Ben Keith was given  some more bars for his splendid pedal steel.
0064471047|5.0|*The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* begins the enchanting series of Narnia books as, in a game of hide and seek, intrepid Lucy stumbles through a wardrobe and into Narnia -- a delightful world of dryads and fauns and  dwarves and animals that talk.  Lucy finds, however, that as things stand,  Narnia is a land of perpetual winter ruled over by an evil witch.  Worse,  even though it's always winter, it's never Christmas (note allegorical  material beginning to rise to the surface).  Lucy must return to her house,  convince her brothers (especially the aptly named Peter) and sister that  Narnia actually exists, and, with the help of Aslan, the great lion, defeat  the witch and bring spring back to the land.  She has her work cut out for  her.<br />As readers, so do many of us.  For in this most delicate and  charming and gemlike of books, C.S. Lewis has planted as heavy-handed an  allegory as anything Edmund Spenser wrote in *The Faerie Queene*.  Lucy, as  her name denotes, brings &quot;light&quot; to Narnia and England.  Aslan is  Christ.  Narnia is the postlapsarian world.  Aslan (Christ) must, according  to the rules of the Emperor-over-the-sea (God), die so that Lucy's brother,  Edmund, (the sinner) can be saved (Saved).  After his death, Aslan comes  back to life (is resurrected) and defeats the witch (temptation/the devil).  Through the spilling of his blood (Blood) all of Narnia is renewed (finds  grace).      If your religious beliefs compell you to point this  not-so-deep meaning out to your own children, then do so, but please don't  spread the word.  When teaching this book in a college-level course on  Children's Literature, I have too many times seen the years of joy this  book has given my students quenched by my Outing Of The Allegory.  This  quenching is nondenominational.<br />What I write now would not bring joy to  C.S. Lewis, but the true miracle of the Narnia series, to this reviewer,  lies in its astonishing ability to survive its own allegory.On the  literal level, these books are marvelous:  they are invigorating, heady,  filled with heroism and magic, great deeds and quests.  They should not be  missed by children of any faith.  My two sons love the series, and,  frankly, as far as the hidden meaning is concerned, I dread the day that  they are finally old enough to ask about it, and I am weak enough to tell.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is a perfect soundtrack for a perfect movie. Each song shouts the emotions the film creates: happiness, sadness, fear, danger, victory, joy, justice. <br />I specifically enjoyed the battle music-it wasn't the only time  a variation of Holst's &quot;Mars: The Bringer of War&quot; has been used  for fighting (see: John Williams' score for the first Star Wars).  <br />Nevertheless, I highly recommend the soundtrack for the best movie so  far this summer.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is flat out a great CD. Her last one was really good, but this one never has a dull moment. Her vocals sound very good, and there are so many awesome songs that are catchy and fun. Way to go Britney!
0783222734|5.0|Jurassic Park is an exellent movie with an exellent cast.  When it hit theaters in 1993 it was an instant hit!  Never before had anyone saw such realness in a dinasour movie!   IN MY OPINION ITS THE BEST MOVIE  OUT!
B00004SCX6|5.0|This album has instanly become my fav. Pretty much every song has the potential to be a single! Of course Oops is a great song. Stronger, What U See, Lucky are my other favs. This album will not dissapoint you. The best  15 bucks I have ever spent, and I mean that! Britney's vocals sound  awesome, especially of Don't Let Me The Last to Know. I can't tell you how  much this album rocks, so just buy it!
B00004SCX6|5.0|A lot of people compare this CD to Britney Spears' first. I think it's all it's own. Oops...I Did It Again is great, I must've watched the video online about a million times. I love this song. In fact, I'm listening to  it right now! The last song, Dear Diary is Brotney's first venture into  songwriting. Pretty good for a first try! The only song I had a problem  with was I (Can't Get No) Satisfaction, becase the beging is so slow. But  overall, this CD is really good!
B000002OFG|4.0|Tom Petty would never again sound as &quot;new wave&quot; as he did on his first album.  The songs are relatively short and have an unpolished feel that he and the Heartbreakers would loose as they matured.  He would also  never again aspire so hard to be Bruce Springsteen as he does especially on  &quot;The Wild One, Forever.&quot;  &quot;American Girl&quot; is the best  and most well known song, but there's a lot of other fine songs in the mix.  Overall, a fine debut album.
B00000J7J4|5.0|Okay I am not a hard core Santana fan, but this is his best CD by far!  Yeah so hes been around forever but that just shows that you are never to old to Rock,n roll!  If you play the gutiar ( Like me) you are going to  apreciate his art and style of playing! I belive he is one of the greatist  gutarist out there! he has a few slow songs but some of them are quite  catchy! I very much enjoyed this alblum and I am sure you will too!
B000002UW1|4.0|With the song &quot;The One I Love,&quot; R.E.M. finally hit the pop charts.  Some long term fans were offended, but side one of &quot;Document&quot; (the first six tracks) are as good as anything they've  ever recorded.  It climaxes with the perfectedly absurd tounge-twister  &quot;Its the End of the World as We Know It&quot; which has been much  imitated (most horribly by Billy Joel with &quot;We Didn't Start the  Fire&quot;).  After &quot;The One I Love,&quot; kicks off side two,  however, things go downhill which separates this from being a five-star  effort.  Still, this is of the band's better albums.
0140067477|5.0|I was recently introduced to taoism through the music of John Cage.  The book is written as if for a child, but the terminology and philosophy put forth is far to introspective and mature for young children to handle.  It  is a gentle lesson on life and priority management.  The author explains  taoist beliefs though a conversation with Pooh and Piglet and the rest of  them, as well as through short stories about their adventures.  The book  comes across astonishingly light for such seemingly serious subject matter.   Large text and simple illustrations only add to the book's levity, but at  the end, you're left feeling peaceful and refreshed.  &quot;The Tao of  Pooh&quot; is ripe for repeat readings, whenever you feel like you need to  relax.  While Eeeore frets...and Piglet hesitates...and Rabbit  calculates...and owl pontificates...<br />Pooh just is.
B000002MH5|5.0|&quot;Where You Been&quot; is a classic example of an artist having one great album in them.  Nothing J Mascis (who, for all practical purposes IS Dinosuar Jr.) has done before or since is even remotely as interesting.  Fans of Neil Young and Crazy Horse will recognize the grooves; alternating  between heavy and mellow in just the right amounts.  The songwriting is  superior, especially on &quot;Out There,&quot; &quot;Start Choppin'&quot;  &quot;Get Me,&quot; and the absolutely amazing orchestral &quot;What Else  is New?&quot;  For great guitar rock, it simply doesn't get any better.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is a lovely and sprawling meditation.  In my opinion, it must be listened to from start to finish.  Skipping around to songs like &quot;Dogs&quot; and &quot;Sheep&quot; (which are both amazing songs, mind  you) doesn't offer the same fluidity and emotional intensity that the  segues do.  Pick up this album and let it run behind a small get together  at your house.  It's an intimate yet grand record.  Highly Recommended.
B000002O5L|5.0|This was Petty's first (and to date only) album sans his fine band, The Heartbreakers.  Nevertheless, the album features Heartbreaker guitarist Mike Campbell and it is otherwise hard to tell.  Certainly it is no radical  departure in sound, despite being co-produced by fellow Travelling Willbury  Jeff Lynne (formerly of ELO).  What it has is a bunch of great songs.  Though not quite as strong as his best album &quot;Southern Accents,&quot;  it still has masterpieces like &quot;Free Fallin',&quot; &quot;I Won't Back  Down,&quot; and the goofy closer &quot;Zombie Zoo.&quot;  You can even  forgive his by-the-numbers cover of The Byrd's &quot;Feel a Whole Lot  Better.&quot;  Overall, a great rock album.
B00003CXDV|3.0|Galaxy Quest gets fulls marks for inventiveness, but misses out on being a true classic since it never really pushes its potential very far. This is mainly due to the fact that Dreamworks clearly cut the film down in post-production to make it a 'nice and safe' PG family film. It mostly feels like an extension of the meta-fictional show it is mocking than a genuine Star Trek parody.<br /><br />Tim Allen is Jason Nesmith, a mostly washed-up actor famous for only one role (a situation Allen himself should be familiar with) on the long-gone Galaxy Quest TV show. His life is nothing more than public appearances (in character) along with the rest of his disgruntled, weary co-stars. But an oddball race of naive octopus creatures called Thermians, from the other side of the universe mistakenly interpret the show as historical documents and beam-up Nesmith and his crew to an exact replica of their fictional spaceship to fight off the evil Sarris, a reptilian warlord dead-set on acquiring the mysterious 'Omega-13'.<br /><br />My biggest greivance with Galaxy Quest is that the production design is just so b-l-a-n-d. Most of the film is gray, gray, and more shades of gray. Give us something pretty to look at! David Newman, who seems to be the go-to guy for family movie scores, offers a very poor melody for the Galaxy Quest TV show (and therefor the whole movie). I didn't expect Goldsmith to parody his own Star Trek work for this, but SOMEONE better than Newman could have worked wonders.<br /><br />They had lightning in a bottle with Galaxy Quest but it fizzled out when they lost sight of any epic feel. As a TV movie it would have been great, as a theatrical effort it does indeed fall short of the mark. But I'll watch Alan Rickman in almost anything and Missi Pyle is also especially cute.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great in 2.35:1 1080p and Dolby TrueHD. A fair amount of self-congratulatory extras are included.
B000002MG1|4.0|&quot;Automatic for the People,&quot; has quite a few good songs, though one might ask what happened to the rock energy that fueled R.E.M.'s earlier albums.  By this time, most of the band's old hardcore fans had labelled  them &quot;sellouts&quot; and deserted them.  What they missed was some of  the prettiest songs the band ever wrote.  &quot;Everybody Hurts,&quot; the  Andy Kaufman tribute &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; and &quot;Sweetness  Follows&quot; are absolutely gorgeous.  Interestingly, when the only time  the album really falters is when they crank up the guitars as on  &quot;Ignoreland.&quot;  Overall, this was another fine album from a great  rock band.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Okay, I'll admit it.  I did like the song &quot;...Baby One More Time,&quot; when it first came out.  However, when it became huge, Britney became so in-your-face, it was borderline repulsive.  You can only see and  hear so much from one person.  (Granted, this does not just go for her.   All current pop teens are receiving WAY too much media coverage).  So, why  the review then?  Well, I told myself not to buy &quot;Oops!...,&quot; but  oops, I bought it anyway.  <br />I just wanted to hear how pop music's current  goddess - at least, for now, anyway - would hold up on her sophomore  effort.  And, in all honestly, I was pleasantly surprised.  <br />The title  track, or &quot;...Baby One More Time Part II&quot; as I like to call it -  because, let's face it, originality is NOT key element used in current pop  music - is good.  If it has a beat, it's a hit, and, yes, &quot;Oops!&quot;  - both the song and the album - will be a huge hit.  <br />There's ear candy  a-plenty on this album.  From &quot;Stronger,&quot; to &quot;Don't Go  Knockin' On My Door,&quot; which is one of the best pop tunes to come along  in a while, to big ballads like &quot;Don't Let Me Be the Last to  Know,&quot; Britney gives it all she has on each and every tune.  <br />That's  not to say that her vocal power is - as compared to rival Christina  Aguilera - staggering.  Britney Spears is never to be confused with Barbra  Streisand, Judy Garland or even Aguilera for vocal range.  But she does  have a uniqueness to say the least.<br />The most surprising song on the album  is Spears' cover of the Rolling Stones' &quot;(I Can't Get No)  Satisfaction.&quot;  It took guts to cover such a song and she will not get  by critics who will undoubtedly pan her and rip her to shreds for even  thinking about covering the song.  But, it's actually quite good and a  better alternative to the other songs on the album because it's the one  tune that doesn't sound like all the others.
B000002LFU|4.0|Okay, &quot;Stand&quot; is admittedly one of the more annoying singles in rock history.  But let's move past that and acknowledge that &quot;Green&quot; is still a pretty darn good album.  Labelled  &quot;sellouts&quot; by many of their hardcore fans, R.E.M. managed the  tricky feat of going mainstream without compromising their artisitic  principles.  Great songs such as &quot;Orange Crush,&quot; &quot;Get  Up&quot; the untitled final track have plenty in common with earlier R.E.M.  Overall, this is a solid album with some definite high points.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD is ten times better than her first one.  The songs are totally different and they are so much cooler than the first ones.  Britney CAN sing so everyone stop saying that a computer makes her voice better.  Did  you see her on MTV?  These songs are so cool, if you loved the first album,  you'll worship this one, if you hated the first album, buy this one b/c you  will love it!
B000002KJL|5.0|Dire Straits's debut album gets the nod for also being their best-ever recording; and not just because it includes the classic &quot;Sultans of Swing.&quot;  Great songs abound and leader Mark Knopfler guitar stylings,  almost blues-like at times, have never been better.  Hard to decide which  songs are the best, though &quot;Down to the Waterline,&quot; &quot;Water  of Love,&quot; and &quot;Wild West End&quot; could certainly fit the bill.  Overall, not a bad song in the mix.  Few rock bands have ever had debut  albums as accomplished and polished as this.
B000003N7K|5.0|I am somewhat shocked that no one has reviewed this outstanding CD. It is truly an notable work of art. Hartman's vocals are impeccable and heart felt and the superb recording quality by none other than Rudy van Gelder  does justice to the music and the musicians. <br />Coltrane's playing just  from a purely technical aspect has never been better. He pretty much lays  back on this session other than a few effective solos, but this only proves  what a tasteful and total musician he really was. And no less can be said  about Tyner, Garrison and Jones. No one initially thought this combination  of musicians would work. But it did and did so supremely well.<br />The  production quality of the CD is typically Impulse! excellent with several  photos and original liner notes as well as an interesting addendum by  producer, Michael Cuscuna.<br />Though this could be called first rate  cocktail hour jazz, it is the kind you will find yourself listening to  intently.
B000002MU3|2.0|Let me start off by saying I am not an &quot;R.E.M. snob&quot; who thinks the band's last good album was released in say 1985 or so.  In fact, &quot;Monster&quot; was the band's first album that I truly did not like.  It starts off with the fantastic single and Dan Rather diss &quot;What's  the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; and then its straight downhill from there.  One problem, I think, is that this was R.E.M.'s long promised return to  their rockin' roots.  By this point, they were simply no longer capable of  creating interesting harder edged songs.  Overall, this is an unfortunate  misstep for a fine band.

B000002UVZ|4.0|With &quot;Life's Rich Pageant,&quot; R.E.M. began to move ever so slowly away from their &quot;alternative&quot; roots towards the more mainstream sound that would come to dominate in the 1990s.  On the cover song  &quot;Superman,&quot; for example, the lyrics are almost totally  decipherable for the first time.  Not that there isn't planty of oblique  R.E.M. classic on this album.  &quot;Flowers of Guatemala,&quot; &quot;What  if We Give it Away,&quot; and &quot;Fall on Me&quot; are the best cuts.  Overall, a solid early period R.E.M. album.
B000002WYT|1.0|Most of my close friends think this guy is the best thing ever, so I picked this up out of curiosity.  Steve Lillywhite's (producer, for those who read liner notes) work with U2, the La's, Talking Heads and Peter  Gabriel is classic.  The man is truly legendary.  &quot;Crash Into Me&quot;  wasn't too bad, so the rest could be better, right?  Wrong.  Aimless  lyrics, substandard &quot;melodies&quot; (I'm still looking), and sub-par  &quot;improvisations&quot; all meet together here, as they apparently have  in the rest of their work.  Top all of this off with quite possibly the  worst vocalist in the last 20+ years and you get DMB.  Really, I mean this  man makes Bob Dylan sound like a choirboy.  This is basically what happens  when a high school jazz band meets Jethro Tull.  This is not adventurous,  this is just bland and inoffensive, wrapped up to look like musical genius  by appearing complex.  All of this has been done before, and better.  If  you want truly adventurous, check out either of Radiohead's last 2 albums,  Spiritualized, or just about anything from Sonic Youth (at least they try).   If you want great instrumentalists, listen to good jazz.  If you want good  music, check anywhere but here.  So much to say, only 1,000 words.  Horrid.
B000002LOE|4.0|&quot;Losing My Religion,&quot; is perhaps the best R.E.M. song to hit the singles chart, overplayed as it might have been on the radio.  For an anedote, try the rap-flavored &quot;Radio Song.&quot;  The rest of  &quot;Out of Time&quot; is uneven, with great songs such as  &quot;Belong,&quot; and &quot;Me in Honey&quot; interspersed with lesser  tracks like the turgid &quot;Low,&quot; and &quot;Country Feedback.&quot;  Whatever this album may lack in the pure rock energy from the band's early  days, it at least makes up for with mature song craft.  Overall, a good  start to the 1990s for the band.
B000002LFZ|2.0|The only good song was Tusk. The rest of it is fluff.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Almost as bad as their live performances is this CD, Enema of the State.  If this is &quot;punk&quot;, music is in worse shape than I thought.  Sure, the punk influences are apparent but that's one of the problems.  Every  song recorded by Blink 182 is a rehash of the last 30 years in punk music.   Punk music always *stood* for something, and that's what made it punk.   Gone are the days of goverment-bashing from real punk bands like The Sex  Pistols and Dead Kennedys, now all punk stands for is cute Third Eye  Blind-like pop ballads about sex and girls and beer and so-called  &quot;teen angst&quot;.  Whatever attempts at humor these 3 morons try is  not even close to funny.  &quot;All The Small Things&quot; and &quot;What's  My Age Again?&quot; are simple, bland pop-dittys.  &quot;Adam's Song&quot;  is probably the highlight of the CD because it fools you to believe they  have a mature/serious side.  But the song still pales in comparison to  other suicide songs like &quot;Fade to Black&quot; (No, don't be mistaken,   I'm not a huge Metallica fan either).  Please, if you want to hear  meaninful, real punk please buy &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting  Vegetables&quot; by Dead Kennedys or &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks...&quot;  by Sex Pistols.  This cd is a waste of your parent's allowance and will be  another embarrasing fad in 5 years.
6305807043|5.0|&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is both one of 1999's best films and also THE weirdest.  A brief summary: a man (John Cusack) finds a portal which you can go into to enter John Malkovich's head.  After fifteen minutes, you  are dropped out of the sky just off the New Jersey turnpike.  He and a  co-worker decide to sell tickets into John Malkovich's head.  That is,  until he finds out.  And that's barely the first half of the film.  It just  gets weirder aftrer that.<br />&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is the product  of a brilliant script and very creative directing by Spike Jonze (who  starred in &quot;Three Kings&quot;).  The acting is incredible and very  believable.  John Malkovich (&quot;The Messenger,&quot; &quot;Dangerous  Liasons&quot;) was both intelligent and brave to take a role in which he is  deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nomination and haillarious as he makes  fun of himself.<br />Anyone who can appreciate the bizarre (think &quot;12  Monkeys&quot; bizarre, but this is far better) will love this movie.  It is  not science fiction for those who dislike such films.  It is a hillarious  comedy with so many twists and turns one viewing does not serve this  amazing film justice.  Definetely worth buying.
B00004SCX6|4.0|While singing the same kind of music, Britney has produced another sure success.(Yes, I bought the album). With a blend of rock-style, rythmic and also a few slow, emotional strains, there is something for anyone who likes  pop or soft-rock music.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Another great cd by Britney Spears. It has both fast and slow songs which are upbeat a very great cd.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I am by no means a hardcore fan of Britney but on this occasion I wanted to actually buy her new album. I NEVER EVER do this! So bear this in mind. Having now got to track eleven the CD is beginning to finally make its  presence felt in my head. Yes I am male and I am 21 and I am not ashamed in  the slightest. I strolled straight in to the store, picked it up, took it  to the counter and paid for it. The track that makes the biggest impression  is &quot;Stronger&quot;. It's got a mean streak in it and I love that! Max  and Rani have done an excellent job and Britney certainly does their words  justice! Congrats on another number one Britney! (I can say well done  before you even release it, I have no doubt it will go to number one on  both sides of the Atlantic). The rest of the CD is not really me (I listen  to Trance and Dance normally) but Oops and Stronger will establish this CD  as another multi-million seller for Britney. If you haven't heard the CD,  which some of the &quot;reviewers&quot; clearly haven't, do yourself a  favour and listen to it before you judge it.
B00004STPT|5.0|Having seen the movie before purchasing the soundtrack, I was not surprised, but rather gratified, at the depth of expression in this recording.  Just as the movie blends the epic with the intensely personal,  so this soundtrack weaves in and out of a personal life as moved by great  affairs.<br />The lyric concept of Maximus, as a man Fated to die, yet bound  inexorably to the past and his family, unites the musical theme.  Against  that, but not alien to it, we have the sweeping &quot;battle pieces&quot;  of the movie.<br />This music is deeply personal, not the overblown, grandiose  music of say, _Spartacus_.  Just as the movie is a quantum leap past the  &quot;swords and sandals&quot; potboilers of the 50s and 60s, this  soundtrack is unexpectedly original, but appropriate and  compelling.<br />Strength and Honor.
B00000IFWE|4.0|T.P. has fallen victim to the same syndrome as on the last 2 albums (Wildflowers, She's The One), releasing what should have been a great 12 track album with 15 tracks, 3 of which are simply sub-standard.  Not only  do they not match up, they actually serve to diminish the impact of the  rest of the album which is simply splendid (yes, Full Moon Fever was very  nice but you can't beat the real sound of The Heartbreakers without sugar  on). Room At The Top, Echo, Rhino Skin, No More, Accused Of Love and others  - top TP tunes all, but take a little advice - buy the album and before you  listen to it, program your CD to record it without the throwaway  'Swingin'', the tiresome 'Billy The Kid' or the excruciating 'I Don't Wanna  Fight' - trust me, don't even put yourself through it.  It's not worth it.   Then listen to your tape instead of the CD and you should find you have a 5  star album instead of a 4.  Also, if anyone knows TP's e-mail address, can  they ask him to leave the dumbed-down, off-the-cuff stuff behind with the  studio warm-up sessions in future cos it's getting expensive having to buy  a tape with every CD. Don't let me put you off though.  A 12 track album  well worth the wait (and the tape).
B00001MXXG|5.0|Where do I start?<br />Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of the most brilliantly constructed films of all time, starting with the tight and witty script, the brilliant characters: Ferris, Cameron, Jeanie and the  Bueller parents, and definitely Principal Edward Rooney.<br />The acting is  great, with (let's face it, it's not Shakespeare, nonetheless) great  comedic performaces and some marvellous directing.<br />Art direction as well,  is so consistent to each character, with unique tendencies, tastes and  styles which say so much about each character - Ferris a fan of the New  Romantics, Sloane the &quot;girly&quot;, Edwward Rooney, the loser driving  a loser Chrysler...<br />And on top of that, a great soundtrack, with The  Smiths, Human League, The english Beat and the unforgettable Yello's  &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;...<br />This is the funniest, most unique and  quintessential &quot;youth&quot; film you will ever see.<br />Watch it, buy  it, keep it...
B0000033P0|4.0|&quot;Tarkus&quot; saw Emerson, Lake And Palmer trying their hardest to outplay all of their contemporaries--a goal which they succeed effortlessly  in achieving--although as a result the album lacks a sense of balance or  restraint.  Its centerpiece is the title suite which took up all of side  one, an intense, varied 20-minute prog epic that hits the listener like a  ton of bricks; its first impression will either leave you fascinated by its  originality and virtuosity, or running from the room screaming of overkill.   Innovative, organ-driven tracks like &quot;Eruption&quot;,  &quot;Iconoclast&quot; and &quot;Manticore&quot; find Emerson and Palmer  wringing dense hailstorms of notes from their respective instruments; Lake  manages to keep up on bass and also provides a sense of accessibility with  his lyrical guitar work on &quot;Battlefield&quot; and melodic tenor vocals  throughout.  The words are adequate but somewhat simplistic indictments of  war and organized religion; it helps that they are delivered by such a  refined vocalist.  The only truly weak points here are the duck-like synth  sounds and rather uninspired soloing on &quot;Aquatarkus&quot;, which  sounds very primitive compared to the lengthy, stellar live version on  1974's &quot;Welcome Back My Friends&quot;.  Side two of the album is  composed of shorter songs that are usually dismissed as filler--but while  all are minor, they are still listenable examples of the trio's sense of  tight ensemble playing: &quot;Bitches Crystal&quot; and &quot;A Time And A  Place&quot; are two bombastic hard rock tracks that mean nothing but sound  terrific, and &quot;Jeremy Bender&quot; is a relaxed, charming ode to the  Wild West.  However, the album's relentless keyboard attack becomes a  little wearisome by its end (the inclusion of an acoustic guitar ballad  from Lake, usually de rigueur on ELP albums, would've provided a welcome  sense of balance).  Overall, &quot;Tarkus&quot; must be lauded for its  creation of a powerful, highly complex new style of progressive hard rock,  but loses points for its lack of restraint (a complaint usually tagged to  all prog-rock by clueless rock critics, but one that actually applies  here).
B000002H70|5.0|There's a lull before Plainsong, the first track on Disintegration, that leaves you on the edge of your seat.  And then after a couple of seconds, you hear chimes, and then a crash, starting what, in my opinion, is the  Cure's best and most consistent albums.  Disintegration is a psychic  journey.  It is dark and melancholic, yet there is something about the  songs that leave you craving for more--perhaps it's Robert Smith's voice,  forboding and sensuous.  Smith's voice matches the lyrics of each song  perfectly, lyrics that in someway you've experienced before: &quot;I've  been looking so long at these pictures of you that I almost believe that  their real...&quot; Disintegration is an album to be listened to over and  over again.  It's a contemplative album you would listen to when the whole  world seems to be playing tricks on you--or when you just need to escape.  It is timeless.  It is quintessential Cure.
B000002NZO|4.0|&quot;Trespass&quot; marked the first Great Leap Forward in Genesis's career.  Heavily influenced by &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot;, the pieces here are much longer and more complex than those on  the  debut &quot;From Genesis To Revelation&quot;, thus providing a  blueprint for the rest of their 70s work.  The playing and singing is far  more competent, although compared to later efforts still sounds a bit  rough; however, this works largely to the advantage of the album, which  exudes a certain quiet, hearfelt melancholy that will surprise anyone who  grew up with the &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; era.  The majority of the  album centers around a delicate 12-string acoustic guitar  interplay--interspersed with snatches of flute and acoustic piano--which  was an early hallmark of the group's sound.  This reaches its peak on  &quot;Stagnation&quot;, a low-key epic which was perhaps the best song in  their repertoire until 1972's &quot;Foxtrot&quot;.  And although the  majority of the album is quiet, acoustic, moody and slightly precious, the  group takes a hard and surprising left turn to riotous electric rock on the  closing piece &quot;The Knife&quot; (based on an organ riff from The Nice's  version of &quot;Rondo&quot;).  Like most early Genesis albums, the lyrics  run the gamut from pretentious, naive fantasy storytelling (&quot;White  Mountain&quot;) to truly inspirational personal insight  (&quot;Stagnation&quot;).  Overall, &quot;Trespass&quot; is an album of  beauty, grace, melodicism and emotional power which sounds very much of its  time; Genesis continued to better its approach with each successive release  until sometime in the mid-to-late 70s.
0679746048|3.0|&quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; is the kind of book I usually gravitate toward and I was looking forward to reading the author's real life account of her experiences.  I was disappointed by the lack of intensity however.  There was real potential for drawing together a time period ( I remember  the late sixties...anyone who was a young adult at that time was apt to be  strongly affected by the changes we all went through ), counterpointed by  the author's inner period of conflict. Instead I got a series of vignettes  of the life inside of the mental institution that were not as powerful as I  had wished. I felt that the author was not being totally honest with  herself when she wrote this book. It was as if she was still protecting  herself.  Why write a book like this unless you are going to pull out all  the stops?  The other people who were in MacLean with her are barely  fleshed out...we are hardly touched by her own predicament, in  fact.<br />Maybe because I was trapped in an all girl's boarding school at the  same time ( the experience was rather similar--we too looked on all the  changes as helpless observers, esssentially) I wanted more. Or maybe it is  just something in myself that recognized she is still hiding  something.<br />Next time, Susannah, be braver and give us the whole truth.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam does it again!  Everytime these five get together, a mystical magic fills the air.  This time you can't but help listen with both ears as the eclectic (and I do mean eclectic) and electric sounds embrace the  deepest part of your soul.  Wonderful lyrics and musical accompaniment  proves that Pearl Jam is here to stay.  They have evolved and come up with  a different sound everytime.  This time around proves that they are  essential artists.  Great job!
B000002JS8|4.0|This is by far the best AC/DC album ever. Bon Scott was really coming into his own. He had a unique graspy sounding, but clear voice.He set the stage and established a fan base for the next album (Back in Black) with Brian  Johnson. Brian Johnson has a real rough voice and has to strain to even  sound half way descent. His voice, especially now, doesn't compare to Bon  Scott. But with the original drummer Phil Rudd back, the band sounds a lot  better than they did before.  Bon Scott was a natural. Also, with hit  singles like Highway To Hell (#47 on the billboard charts) and Touch Too  Much. It showed that american radio was starting to catch on.  There could  have been more hit singles if the band would have released more. This album  sounded more polished than the others. With Angus Young's guitar solo's and  Bon's Graspy but Clear voice, this album will always be played on rock  radio now and way in the future.
006109594X|5.0|I read this book years ago when it first came out.  I loved it i went right through it.  I enjoyed the plot.  It worried me to think that we could lose a carrier that easy.  Despite that i loved the book pick it up.
B0000399WC|5.0|This movie is the best example of Steve McQueen's acting skills, bar none.  Everyone who thought he was a one note player should look close and hard at this magnificent film.  The chemistry between McQueen and Dustin Hoffman is a real tear-jearker.  This should have been McQueen's Oscar, but he was  not one to kiss anybody's butt for the statue.  For me, this is a true tale  of the survival spirit, really better than the GREAT ESACPE as far as  serious pathos is concerned.  Let's not forget Dustin Hoffman's character  Dega.  This was a composite of several people in the book.  The final scene  on the cliff should go down as a classic moment in cinema.  Steve, we miss  you!

B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney comes back strong. She shows off her powerful voice and has funky new up-beat tunes. I love the cd and I think you would too!
B000002IZ4|5.0|This in the first and only CD I can actually say is full of great tracks!  There is not one bad song on it.  It goes from raging guitars to romantic love song with an alternative twist (still remains).  This CD is a great  investment and even though I bought it years ago I play it more than any CD  I own.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.
0790734850|5.0|This movie is made briliantly. Technically, this movie stands out. The direction is good, Music is Great , editing wonderful and the cast's  Acting is superb(though I did not really think Kim Bassinger was worth the  Oscar). The DVD quality is one of the very best. This is a serious type of  movie and a must see if you do not despise serious movies.
6305609721|4.0|This is one of the better Star Trek movies, but my comment is focused on the DVD. All of the Star Trek movies are higher than the normal price and contain very little to no extra features. I believe Paramount is going to  release these all again with extra features once everyone has bought these  versions. Wait for the &quot;Collectors Editions.&quot;
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural is a continuation of Pearl Jam's musical path.  Some may like to say evolution, and while I agree that they get better as a band with each album, Binaural isn't so much evolution, as it is the next logical step.   All band members contribute heavily to the writing of songs on Binaural,  and to good result; each track is a winner, with none really standing out  from the pack.  From the rocking gem &quot;Grievance&quot; to the somber  simplicity of &quot;Soon Forget,&quot; this album is chock full of varied  musical excellence that fans have come to expect thanks to such great  recent albums as Yield.  Binaural is Pearl Jam's most flowing and complete  album to date.  Let me put it to you this way, if you are the kind of Pearl  Jam 'fan' who thinks that Ten is their best offering, then you might not  appreciate this album, however, if you are the kind of fan who throws their  favor behind albums such as Yield, then you will most likely enjoy this  album.
0440180295|4.0|If Albert Einstein had written a science fiction book, it would have been something like Slaughterhouse Five.  I first read this over twenty years ago in high school and I still take it out every two years or so to enjoy  again.  Vonnegut isn't the world's best writer, but he is certainly one of  the most imaginative and witty in a socially responsible way.  As anti-war  propaganda, I put this book square between All Quiet on the Western Front  and Catch-22. But what I really enjoyed about Slaughterhouse Five (and  imagine Albert would have liked to) is Vonnegut's imaginative use of time  and space.  Vonnegut presents philosophy (of a sort) as comedy and the  result is one hell of a good book.
B00003Q438|4.0|One word can really describe this movie finally being coded to DVD, AWSOME.  I remember being in High School when this movie was released in 1989.  I saw it then and was stunned by such a movie of high calibur.  Now  it being released to DVD format with restored footage, this clearly  explains many questions we might have had when we saw it the first time  around.  After you watch the making of this movie, you come to realize that  the actors were very underpaid to do this type of difficult movie. <br />       If you have not seen this movie of true underwater adventure, then you do  not know what you are missing.  No other underwater movie tops what this  movie created.  It is hard to believe that many of the ideas in this movie  were very plausible.  For example the florocarbon oxygenated water that  they use in the movie, you breathe in, instead of air is the actual stuff  in the scene with the rat.   <br />      This movie shows and points out that  are possibly being observed by aliens.  But why do they not contact us?   Why do they just sit back and observe?  Because all they have to do is view  our history as a violent world (wars, genocide, etc) to make them wary of  contact.  In reality there are areas of the ocean to this day that we  cannot penetrate and see.  Who knows what might be down there.  This movie  will show you one possible encounter.  This DVD is also jam packed with so  much content you will literally spend hours pouring over storyboards, and  information.  This is how DVD's should be made and how others should be  molded.
0553208845|5.0|Don't read this or any other review before you read this book!But if you must... It is certainly Hesse's easiest book tomaster and, despite it's apparent simplicity, one of the deepest. .... ...the book is merely about every man's humanity starting with Siddhartha's fall from a proud arrogant youth, perfect in his piety, through the materialism of his adulthood, ending in his final, simple understanding of himself and his relationship to the world around him. This is a book about self-realization, Siddhartha's and yours.  Which is why I recommended you not reading this or any other review.  Open the book, read the book, be the book (gag), and come to your own interpretation.
6305127638|4.0|This is the best of the Next Generation films so far.  Great acting, wonderful directing from Jonathan Frakes, superb score from Jerry Goldsmith, beautiful visuals, and a script so appealing one wonders why no  one thought of the idea before.<br />The Borg seem to me to be the most  terrifying villain any Star Trek crew has ever encountered--for they  threaten more than one's life--they threaten to destroy one's identity.<br />Part of what makes this film work is what made several of the previous  Star Trek films, and much of the Classic series, work so well:  The  abandonement of technobabble and the placement of visual effects squarely  at the service of the story.  Also, the characters are more  three-dimensional here--Patrick Stewarts's performance merits particular  praise.  For nearly the first time in the Next Generation run, the Captain  is not just a guy in the center seat giving orders, but a leader.<br />By  sending the Enterprise-E back in time to the mid-21st Century, the audience  is able to witness &quot;future history&quot; in the making.  But herein  lies one of this films few problems: My one caveat with this film is the  lack of respect shown by the producers for consistency in Star Trek lore.  An example: Zefram Cochrane was played in the Classic ceries by Glenn  Corbett, who died in 1993.  James Cromwell, a fine actor in his own right,  does not resemble in the slightest Mr. Corbett.  Why couldn't Mr. Frakes  and Mr. Berman find someone who at least bore a passing resemblance to the  original actor?  The simple question is that they did not care about  consistency, nor do they have any respect for the Classic series, or its'  fans.<br />For all that, the scenes leading to man's historic first warp  flight are riveting, and the final scene of first contact with the alien  ship was very moving--although absolutely no one in the audience was  surprised when the aliens race was revealed.<br />This is one of my  demonstration DVDs.  The transfer and sound are excellent, although one  could have wished for more extras from Paramount.r and sound are excellent, although one  could have wished for more extras from Paramount.

B000021Y77|5.0|This movie is the fasted paced movie I've ever seen!  Tom Tykwer doesn't miss a beat.  He did an amazing job of creating an unrelenting drive that doesn't let up until the final shot.  The movie is full of stunning pans  and great color contrasts.  It is a movie that I would recommend to anyone.
0783110871|5.0|I've read other viewers comments and I think they are making a big mistake. This movie is obviously not a piece of art. It can not be compared to movies like &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;2001 Space  Odyssey&quot;,&quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;,&quot;The Last Temptation of  Christ&quot; or other movie milestones. In this respect this movie is  &quot;stupid&quot;. But if you want to unplug yourself and keep your brain  at rest for a while, well this movie is entertaining and fulfills this  mission. In this respect I STRONGLY recommend people to buy this movie and  to watch it several times.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten I think is the best CD in the world.  If you don't own it you should buy it.  If you like mellow songs it has tracks such as Black, Alive, Jeremy, Release Me, and Oceans.  If you like faster songs there are tracks  such as Once, Evenflow, Why Go, and Porch.  Anyone will like this CD if  they buy it.  So I suggest this CD to everyone.  Trust me you won't be  dissapointed.
0792842731|5.0|I've been a fan since Connery was Bond,but Brosnan seems born for the role.He brings all the best elements of his predecesors together in this one.Jonathan Pryce is fun as a sort of Bill Gates/Rupert Murdoch/Ted Turner  amalgam.Michelle Yeoh is the best female counterpart to Bond since Honor  Blackman in Goldfinger. As usual the action is breathtaking,the stunts are  over the top,and the entire flick is just fun! The Sheryl Crow video is a  great extra and one of the best Bond songs in years. Buy it!
B00004T8RK|5.0|As a Pearl Jam fan of many years, it's nice to finally see Eddie and the boys become men on this album, going beyond the angst-ridden vocals and guitars of past to using extreme subtlety and passionate voices to convey  their point.  With No Code and Yield, there seemed to be an artistic rut  (4-Star ruts, mind you) that they were stuck in--with Binaural, this album  is their 4WD vehicle out of it.  <br />Vedder does an excellent job of letting  the words he sings do the speaking for him, other than his vocals doing the  trick as in Vitalogy and No Code.  &quot;Thin Air&quot; smacks of an  angered &quot;grungineer&quot; finally finding something to comfort him the  world, and &quot;Nothing as it Seems&quot; is a hauntingly good track which  shows off Eddie's vocals to a 'T'.  I have to go on record as saying this  is one of the best rock albums that I have ever heard, and I strongly  suggest getting a copy of this album.  You'll only be disappointed with  this album if you can't evolve as a listener with the band and are stuck in  the early 90's Ten/Vs. rut.
B000001ZS4|5.0|The album is so full of details that you simply cant get tired listening to it. Ive been listening to this album for sure once/two weeks for seven years and still like it. Thats quite amazing. Greetings to all from Anders
B00000JCOV|5.0|Raw. Brutal. Ruthless. Those three words sum up SlipKnot's debut. KoRn meets Slayer is the sound, masks and numbers are the look, and with a dash of aggro-rap that makes you take notice. When I first heard of SlipKnot, I  wasn't sure what to think. Masks? Can you say gimmick? Nine members? They  better be good! Thankfully, they are. 'Nu-metal' bands are all the rage  today, and someone has to take it to the extreme. KISS? Marilyn Manson? Not  exactly. If you take the sound of KoRn with the speed of Slayer you'll get,  a headache. But if you take nine great musicians and a great producer and  put them in the mix, you got yourself an album! A great album, in fact,  this is up in the amazing metal debuts category with KoRn, Slayer, Rage  Against The Machine, Pantera, Tool and the Deftones. Let me say this, Ross  Robinson is officially the best metal producer, ever. His talent helps  forge SlipKnot's into what it is. Band wise they have a singer, a bassist,  two guitarists, a drummer, two percussionists, a dj and a sampler/media  player, whatever that is. Yup, they're getting a serious paycut. Now don't  get me wrong, all nine musicians are great, but special attention must be  paid to the drummer, Joey. This guy is awesome. He's so fast that you swear  you're hearing a gun. Bullets everywhere, but no, it's just some guy in a  mask playing his drums. Lots of good songs here, the best being &quot;Spit  It Out&quot;. It recalls the early rap/metal years: Anthrax. For the  thirteen year olds, Anthrax INVENTED rap/metal, before RATM and way before  Limp Bizkit. The thing is, Anthrax were too thrash in a hairband decade, so  not too many people know of the underground legends. If anyone tells you  otherwise, they're poseurs, Anthrax did it all. Anyways, &quot;Spit It  Out&quot; sounds like Anthrax's &quot;I'm The Man&quot; on crack, a very  high praise. Another good one is &quot;Eyeless&quot;, check out Amazon's  samples. Awesome stuff, huh? Unfortunately, the best songs arethe first  six, and the first song is only an intro. Of the rest of the songs,  &quot;Me Inside&quot; stands out. That's not to say the rest are bad,  they're just not as good. &quot;(Sic)&quot; and &quot;Scissors&quot; are  really good as well. Lyrically, I have no idea what to make of it. 'You  can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes'? Did I miss something  here? Oh well, at least he name checks a great actor. Some of the other  lyrics border on genius and stupidity, often in the same line. If you're  under fifteen, these lyrics might seem awesome to you, anyone else might  laugh, but who cares? Music is meant to be fun, and that's exactly what it  is, lots of fun. In the end, you can't go wrong with this CD, but if you  think KoRn is a bit too heavy, you would be well advised to steer clear.
1853811262|5.0|I am amazed at the negitivity that the other readers haveexpressed regarding Atwood's Cats Eye.  <br />People have been soconditioned that they must expect a structured beginning, middle and end to a story.  They must have some conflict that needs to (and will be) resolved by the end of the story.  I say look deeper and you will find it in Atwood's Cats Eye.<br />The story was there, it lay bed of rich symbolic nature.<br />Elaine, disturbed and tormented, in her youth, held on to a cats eye marble.  The story also told of her in her adult life, as a painter.  Her paintings unleashed some of her youth, but it was not until she opened up a hope chest, found her red purse and the glass marble inside...that she had put all the pieces together.<br />You see, she had burried(in the hope chest) her hurt(the marble) so deep in her heart (the red purse)...and left it there...for years.  Until she found it. <br />This story came full-circle.  I enjoyed the uniqueness Atwood gave, and would re-read it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|If you are into pop music and like or appreciate dance tunes then this album is a 5-star! Britney is such a great singer and awesome performer in general!  The CD features so many good tracks like her new hit single  &quot;Oops...I did it again!&quot; and &quot;Stronger&quot; and many more  of course...The songs are totally catchy and she definitely did it again!
6305910103|5.0|This movie is GREAT!  With Khan back from the Star Trek: The Original Series, he once again battles with Capt. Kirk. The Genesis device was helpful for the storyline which pitted Kirk against his archnemesis Khan.  Full of riviting action, this movie is a must for any Star Trek fan!
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182's new CD Enema of the State is their best one yet.  They put this together so good.  I love all of the songs on it.  The way that they change it up from fast to slow fast slow is great.  These guys are not all  about money.  I thought that Adam's Song was and is still awesome.  I cry  everytime I hear it because I recently had a frined commit suicide and it  is very emotional.  They also do a good job with &quot;What's My age  Again?&quot;, &quot;Alien's Exist&quot;, and All the Small Things.&quot;  I  would recomend this CD to anyone that likes a little bit of punk mixed with  some I dont even know what it is.  It is just good old music that i like  and you would too. THE END

The biggest problem is that i'm  a pearl jam fan and this isn't what I paid my money for I want those  catchey songs that you can't get out of your had and make you think that  music just never gets this good . if you already have the other pearl jam  cd's buy this its worth it just for the single but if you don't have any  buy vs,ten hell even vitalogy because thats what your really looking for.
B00004SCX6|5.0|The Britters has once again proved she deserves to be at the top with her newest album &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again.&quot; On this album, Britney explores her emotions and even wrote and co-wrote some songs on the album.  This album is definately much much better than &quot;...Baby One More  Time&quot; and I thought that was the best album ever, well, imagine what  this one is like. Many diss Britney and one of my friends did it all the  time. When she heard &quot;Don't Go Knockin' On My Door&quot; she said  &quot;I've got to get this CD! Britney all of a sudden got better and grew  up!&quot; Well, another hater-turned-fan. I hope this album does better  than the last because she truly deserves it. If *N Sync weren't so greedy  with the #1 position on the Billboard 200 Album Charts, Britney would  definately be there! Let's keep out fingers crossed!  BRITNEY IS #1!
0393312836|3.0|A good writer is able to create entire worlds, entire histories for their works.  A great writer is able to explain everything with little confusion.  The ideas are intense in Burgess' classic work but the nature of this  intensity, the radical differences and strong slang, undermine the ability  of the reader to enjoy and follow along.  Not a book to read for fun, but  it raises some powerful questions about society and the individual, where  do my rights interfer with yours and visa versa.

It's not quite as well-rounded as some of Smith's earlier works, but it certainly has some high points...<br />...the tracks I keep going back to are &quot;In  the Lost and Found&quot; and &quot;Happiness&quot;.  <br />To fans of Elliot  Smith I'd say (even though you probably already have it) go get it.<br />To  new-comers:  I'd start with his earlier works which give a more  well-rounded introduction to an excellent song writer.

0345350472|3.0|Usually, one reads the book then goes to the theater or turns on the television and is disappointed.  However, while the movie lacks the complexity of this book, it at least gives us even to care about some of  the characters a little bit.  Perhaps it is the science aspect that is  bringing me down -- I'm just not buying the premise of the book.  Perhaps  it is the view of humans' need for religion -- but I'm not buying the idea  that the fake can replace the real for most people.  All in all, I was  disappointed.

B00004T8RK|5.0|With all the rap-rock, pop-rock, and plain old junk rock, its nice to know that there's still room from straight ahead rock and roll. That's what Pearl Jam's new album gives you. The opening three songs are blistering  hard rock, getting you moving, setting you up for one of the most beautiful  songs theyve ever written- Light Years. Nothing as it Seems is a radical  departure from previous efforts, and sounds amazing. Thin Air is  unhealthily catchy. Of the Girl is a great midtempo rocker, while Rival is  hauntingly pretty (check out the dog at the beginning). Sleight of hand may  take a while to get into but its worth the time. Soon forget features  Vedder on the UKELELE!. And, parting ways is a great somber closer.     All  in all an amazing album, whether or not you've been a past fan or not.
B000001DVD|5.0|I still remember the day in 1981 when I first heard Let It Go on the radio in Tucson. This group grew to be my favorite and this second release from the boys from England is what I believe to be their most raw, powerful  release. While it did not get the commercial success that Pyromania or  Hysteria received, the influence of producer Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange  gave it what it needed to be a major influence album for the entire 80's  pop metal genre.<br />Let It Go, Hit and Run, High 'n' Dry, Bringin' On the  Heartbreak / Switch 625, You Got Me Runnin', Lady Strange and Mirror,  Mirror are great tunes. Bringin' on the Heartbreak was the defining power  ballad for the group and for most of the following pop metal groups like  Cinderella, Ratt and the rest. This is one of my Top Ten albums and well  worth buying if you are a true Def Leppard fan.
B000001E21|4.0|At the very end of this CD is a hidden piano only version of Miss you in a Heartbeat. (I know, 3 versions on one album? Good Grief!) But it is BY FAR the best version. Why it wasn't released as the &quot;official&quot;  version is beyond me.

Similar to &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; (but more experimental,  electric, and with fewer blues influences), this CD plays with established  lines, exploring their possibilities, and layering nuance and punctuation  in a lush flow of musical sensation.  I kid you not.<br />The music can be  either energizing (especially the second half) or relaxing, or both,  depending upon your mood and needs. Exceptional empathy among the  musicians; even the non-jazz fan will like this album. Most highly  recommended!

Of the Girl is a great midtempo rocker, while Rival is  hauntingly pretty (check out the dog at the beginning). Sleight of hand may  take a while to get into but its worth the time. Soon forget features  Vedder on the UKELELE!. And, parting ways is a great somber closer.     All  in all an amazing album, whether or not you've been a past fan or not.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Hey this is the best pearl jam album since vs.  It is so hard to follow up on a classic like ten and then vs., so pearl jam had to move on.  They still are a great band just wish they rocked out a little more.  Still a  soild buy and a great listen
B00003CWOL|5.0|..even though i am a huge star wars fan and i absolutly loved the phantom menace, i really think dogma should have won the award for best movie...why...because it was the most orriginal movie of the year...it was  entertaining and had many points to it if you payed close enough attention  to the movie...i think the movie is great because it states what is wrong  with organized religion in general but yet kept me very entertained..i  thought the characters were great, the lines were great and the movie as a  whole was great...i suggest that if anyone hasn't seen it go rent it, you  won't be disappointed
B00004SCX6|2.0|Britney has grown up, for sure. Her songs are more mature and worldly wise, but the upbeat pop sound is gone. None of the songs ever take off,  and her rendition of the Stones' &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is blasphemy.  It's good to hear her again, but don't believe the hype. This is a  sophomore slump and she will have to retool for a comeback next time.
6305079900|5.0|There are many very good reviews of this film below.  Therefore, this review will deal solely with the technical aspects of the DVD.<br />Amazon gave this DVD very poor picture and sound ratings (Picture: 3, Sound: 1.5).   I was hesitant to purchase this DVD because of those ratings.  However,  the DVD is at a quality level similar to the actual theatrical  presentation.  Do not let these low ratings deter you from purchasing this  DVD.  The movie was made in 1984, so make no mistake about it, this film is  not at a quality level similar to modern DVD films, however, this movie is  more then &quot;viewable.&quot;  The DVD presentation of &quot;The  Terminator&quot; is of sufficent quality for one to enjoy the film.
B000005HBI|4.0|I first borrowed this CD from a friend and after I finally had to return it, I walked around hot and humid downtown D.C. searching for my own copy. I didn't have time to wait for any mail deliveries. This CD has it all --  thoughtful lyrics, lush arrangements and impeccable delivery. I loved the  way Ms. Wilson melds jazz, blues and country. My favorite track is  &quot;You don't know what love is.&quot; The lyrics are poignant and aren't  overwhelmed by the music. Wilson's delivery is understated, but powerful. I  enjoyed the entire CD, but I played that one song repeatedly.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Someone needs to teach Britney how to sing. Her songs are really bubblegum songs for her bubble gum fans.  I wouldn't waste a penny on her album even if it was worth that much. It should be worth that much.
B00004TJKI|5.0|An army lieutenant shoots a bar owner for allegedly raping his wife; Stewart tries to convice the jury that he's innocent of first degree murder, since he was the \\"victim of an irresistible impulse\\"...........Director Otto Preminger thrived on tense legal show downs, and this is perhaps his best, mostly for Stewart's cagey performance as the deceptively wily small-town lawyer. Preminger's landmark courtroom film is one which the public and critics alike took very seriously back in 1959. Under Preminger's flawless direction, the trial draws a fine line between drama and proper courtroom procedure. The plot is complicated by the nature of the criminals and defendants none of whom are purely good or evil, but who all have a complex relationship to the law and society. Lee Remick and George C. Scott are excellent in their roles and Eve Arden is interesting in her off-beat role as Maida. Some feel Ellington's score is a plus, others feel it's unsuitable. Although the film received 7 AA nominations, it garnered none. The judge in the film was played by Joseph N. Welch, who defended Joseph McCarthy during the 1954 anti-communist witch hunts.
B00003CXDU|5.0|I saw Star Wars in its original release when I was 14 years old (the perfect age) and was blown away by it. Not since then has a movie grabbed my attention (Raiders came close, though!)in quite the same way--until  Galaxy Quest, that is. I just had to buy the video and I've watched it  every day since then. It has definitely replaced Star Wars as #1 on my all  time favorite list. This is a must have movie!
B00000I8UE|3.0|I've been a fan of Cassandra Wilson's song stylings since I picked up Blue Skies, a album of jazz standards. Her smoky alto and impeccable delivery were magnificent and made me a fan forever. I will admit that it took some  time for Traveling Miles to grow on me. I love her voice and would listen  to her sing just about anything, but I wasn't feeling this CD immediately  -- it seemed a little skittish what with her eclectic influences. But I  soon realized that her eclectic sensibilities are what makes her one of my  favorite artists.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney only took 1 year to grow up. That includes her personality. The effect of her clothing and body greatly changes the minds of people, even though the 8-year-old girls still adore her. Britney's new Cd &quot;Oops I  Did It Again&quot; the song is very upbeat and catchy. Although her  &quot;I'm not so innocent&quot; changes the aspect of critics, the song is  still one of my faves. &quot;Stronger&quot; sounds like a major  top-charter. All of the new songs aren't as stupid as the old ones, but I  think one thing:<br />Her songs are better Her image is worse.<br />Buy this if  you like r&amp;b and pop mixed style of music. there is a lot of Cyndi  Lauper or Cher style in it
6305177473|5.0|A great movie you can watch again &amp; again with your children.A delight every time.
B000003S0B|3.0|Okay,okay,okay (to be heard like, uh, Joe Pesci in &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;)<br />I have always liked, at least 6 out of 10, this album. Sometimes, over these 30 years it's been 'out', less than I could, but  sometimes much more than a 6. <br />There's never been, to me, a thematically-  or musically-properly sequenced King Crimson album. I would have  heretically tossed &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot; off the first  album and asked for something more musically appropriate to the  &quot;channel&quot; they laid down starting with &quot;I Talk To The  Wind&quot;. That's partly due to Fripp tossing &quot;Schizoid&quot; onto a  live recording, or compilation, every chance he's ever had. As  &quot;Pictures Of A City&quot; never suffered that, it's easier on my ears  and psyche! <br />Although this remastered edition [I have the limited edition  folding cardboard cover with pictures insert strike] is sonically clean, I  hear no improvements, only changes. The wraith-ish &quot;Peace: A  Beginning&quot; is mixed so low (still! ) at the album's beginning that no  wonder other reviewers say &quot;duh, it begins with 'Pictures At A  City...&quot;. I'm sure the volume level contrast was adventurous and a  sure bet to get a first time listener to turn up the gain on her/his  amplifier's volume knob in 1970 or 1971, so &quot;Pictures Of A City&quot;  could blast out and surprise and impress the poor dazed sod, but, I thought  remastering was a real deal--improvement of the original AND/OR restoration  of the original. I don't feel Robert Fripp has fulfilled his end of the  bargain. You can either listen to &quot;Peace&quot; or &quot;Pictures&quot;  at the right volume level for your comfort, or you can stand by the amp and  turn it down after &quot;Peace: A Beginning&quot; and leave it alone. I  don't like a recording that demands that I dash and adjust the volume every  time I play it, or skip the first track, set the median volume, then settle  back and enjoy.<br />Fripp has also changed &quot;Cat Food&quot;--again! Some  years back he truncated it for &quot;Frame By Frame&quot; (that version was  2:45). Here it's at it's lp running length of 4:55, but the final piano  fillip by Keith Tippett (who put the 'cat' in &quot;Cat Food&quot;) is  almost inaudible unless you've got the cd booming out across the room and  scaring the cat and girlfriend away. No,on the points that matter, (sonic)  this reissue of a fine, fine album isn't worth the extra investment.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Britney spears is def. the queen of teen and the queen of pop.  She has sold over 12 million copies of her 1st cd and that entitles her to a little something, but not a whole lot.  After listening to her old cd and  basically hating the cd I decided what the heck, I'll give her a second  try.   I noticed she got a little better.  Her beats are better on this cd  and her lyrics have managed to improve(a little bit).  But then again the  same problems I had with the first cd, I again have with this cd.  Her  voice is not one of the best out there.  On certain songs she can use the  voice she has to mix well with the song, but on other tracks, her voice  falls flat.  She has no real singing talent and this cd shows that.  She  agains has no real meaningful tracks, none of the songs on here are her own  and there is no personel connection between her and her music.  But hey  what about the CD itself:<br />1. Oops!...I Did It Again (Is an okay song.  It  has a good beat) 2. Stronger (nice track) 3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door  (Good track) 4. Satisfaction (I Can't Get No)(Um can you butcher?  That's  what she does to this track, worst cover! One of the worst on the cd) 5.  Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know (Not feeling this track either) 6. What U  See (Is What U Get) (See #5 comment)  7. Lucky (Okay, not great, but not  bad) 8. One Kiss From You (Don't ask) 9. Where Are You Now  (KInda liked  it) 10. Can't Make You Love Me (Alright) 11. When Your Eyes Say It (Nice  track) 12. Dear Diary (I move to burn the diary and this track)   As you  can see a few good tracks but more that don't impress me much.  If you like  pop you might like this cd, plus I think all you brit fans will enjoy this  cd because it is better in my opinion.  But still it is not great.  She  still has yet to really prove she can sing and she still has too much  chesse on this cd.  Overall it gets a 3.  She is just another blonde  bombshell, but her cd does not seperate her from the rest of the crowd,that's why she gets the average 3 stars.  Personally I'd wait for the  singles....you'll save alot of money by doing so!
6305810109|5.0|In a time when special effects and too many cuts take the place real human experience, it is a sigh of relief to know that there are still films out there that you don't have to download into your brain. The oldest  ingredients are still the best: simple settings, spiritually uplifing  music,commanding cinematography and truly fragile portrayals by people  worthy of being called actors. The performances of Richard Farnsworth,  Sissy Spacek and the rest of the cast are what genuine filmmaking always  has and always will be about.<br />The Straight Story is by far one the best  films I have ever seen in my life- and as a filmmaker, I have seen many. It  is but once in very, very, very blue moon which we see a picture that  measures up to the quality and caliber of this simple story. The power of  persistence and the capacity of the human soul to perform great deeds is  the focus of this subtle masterpiece! This is a story from which all of us  should take example.
B000002LKF|5.0|If you are a fan of music that goes beyond the inanity of pop and &quot;modern rock,&quot; this is the album to buy.  It is a sin that everyone thinks Graceland is the great Paul Simon album simply because it  won the Grammy.  Every one of my friends who love Simon choose this as  their pinnacle.  Do not hesitate to make it part of your collection.
B000003BF1|5.0|This album reminds me of a tasty cream-filled donut. Light, flaky, and moist on the outside. Delicious, sweet chocolate frosting. A generous filling of Bavarian cream on the inside. Fantastic.
B00003CXDV|4.0|Sigurney(I can't spell her name) Weaver as Barbie.<br />Tim Allen as Captain Kirk(Sorta)<br />Alan Ricknam as a Spock/Tuvock/Data Fusion(Interesting!)<br />Tony Shaloub as a spineless Scotty(Did a great  Job)<br />This is the Funniest film since Airplae in 1980. OK OK Since Star  Trek The Motion Picture.<br />SEE THIS ONE!<br />By the way, ILM did the  effects for the movie, NOT PARAMOUNT IN HOUSE DILDOS! State of the art  Silicon Graphics machines REALLY HELP!

0425170349|5.0|This is a very unique concept. Bringing all of the special ops people together to fight terrorism This book had a very good plot. Raising a villain from the KGB to spearhead the plans of the evil billionaire was a  very good idea on Clancy's part. John Clark proved himself very competant  playing the lead role in this book. The Rainbow Six groups confrontations  with the Terrorist factions (including the IRA) made for exciting reading.  A very good book. I certainly hope he does a sequel.
B00004T8RK|4.0|It's hard to describe this record, except that it every bit sounds the product of hundreds of hours of jam sessions and a commitment to experimenting.  Every song is a uneasy ride of unusual melodies, angular  riffs, abrupt dynamics, subtle experimentation.  One could even call this a  sort of punk-jazz record, like a Fugazi or Minutemen.  At the least, every  song has surprises that suggests influences (Who, Fugazi, MC5, Radiohead?,  even trip-hop) but NEVER plays to the rules.  This record is probably  commercial suicide, but for once Eddie Vedder has a band that challenges  him as much as he the band.  If none of the rockers really gel and the  ballads are uneasy, the album as a whole still is a wild ride.  Often  thrilling, maddening, but always full of music, making Binaural the most  committed Pearl Jam album since Vitalogy.
0375411550|4.0|The Bluest Eye is the second inspirational novel we have read by Toni Morrison.  Our first eye-opener by Morrison, Beloved, has a fast moving and detailed plot.  The Bluest Eye, on the other hand, brings you face to face  with the African American's view of &quot;perfect&quot; in a predominately  white society.  This is an alarming and moving story that is not the  typical novel on predjudism.  It has changed our views on the  stereotypoical &quot;beauty&quot; and we recommend this book to everyone,  but especially women.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney did it again! She made another great CD! The songs are much more vocal and really sound more mature. She has a great voice!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I totally think that this is going to be the album of the year and will make Britney earn more Grammy's, fans and respect. Its the best album ever that I have ever heard. Much better than Baby One More Time. Its a lot  funkier and mature. It can make you feel good and make you wanna get up and  dance! This is THE ALBUM of the millenium and summer.
0380002930|5.0|This book is one of my all-time favorites.  It doesn't hurt that I'm a rabbit lover, but there's more to this book than cute, furry bunnies.  If you're looking for a fluffy book without substance, pass this one up.  It's  a great read and hard to put down once you start.  <br />You can read this  book a couple of different ways.  You can take it at face value:  a  delightful book about a group of rabbits from their perspective.  Their  journey is filled with rich details:  near misses, triumphs, and a  tear-jerker for an ending.  Adams peppers the book with words from the  lapine language (didn't you know that rabbits could speak?).  You can also  look beyond the simpler story and look deeper at the symbolism that's  intertwined into this story.  Adams touches on many themes in this book  (don't want to give anything away, but you'll know what I mean when you  read it.)<br />I chose the former, but was always aware of the latter.  No  matter what, it's an absolutely delightful tale that I've already read a  few times.  Join Fiver, Hazel-Rah, and the rest of the gang as they band  together to boldly go where no rabbit has gone before.  Laugh with them,  fear for them, admire their courage; this is a classic that should be a  &quot;must read&quot;.
B00004T8RK|2.0|I really had high hopes for this cd.  After being disappointed with No code, Yeild was a major improvement.  I figured that this latest release from Pearl Jam would be even better.  I was wrong.  Out of 13 songs, I can  honestly say that only about 4 or 5 have any kind of hook or melody to  them.  &quot;God's Dice&quot; and &quot;Evacuation&quot; are utterly  pointless!  However,this album does have some moments of genius.  The songs  &quot;Light Years&quot; &quot;Nothing as it Seems&quot; &quot;Thin  Air&quot; and &quot;Insignificance&quot; Are excellent, but everything else  is nothing but filler.  I will always be a Pearl Jam fan and I will always  buy their music, but this cd is a little hard to swallow.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I have purchased and listened to Britney's new album.  In my opinion, it's better than the first album, and I think everyone should get it.  My favorite song from the new album is Lucky, but eveything else is also great.
B00004SZWB|4.0|I think Stevie Wonder is incredible. This Cd was hard to find for a long time. I love Master blaster( jammin')! I remember going to see Stevie  on this tour. He was Magical! This to me is one of the last Chapters of a  certain Style that began in 1970. That is an accomplishment in it's own  right. Who today has a run of consistent excellence like that!  I highly  recommend this for any Cd collection, and most definitely if you like  Stevie Wonder-
078401213X|4.0|I say this was a worthwhile movie all in all. I did not enjoy the black and white, grainy filming, though. Good points:          This movie makes you want more...&quot;who are all these people, anyway?&quot;        It  follows life from a different point...psychopathy.        Semi-scary  scenes...I'm still get freaked out by that brain-in-the-subway scene.<br />          Bad points:<br />       Actually, there's only one: the filming. It's  hard to enjoy this film as it is in black and white.<br />      Very cool.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album rocks to say the least. I have been a Metallica fan for 12 years and this album is my second favorite. To me, nothing can beat Master of Puppets. Every song is great on this CD. I enjoy For Whom the Bell  Tolls, Fade to Black, and Creeping Death the most. Go get this album now!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney has definitely suprised me! This new album is great. Her last album had too many mushy ballads on it but not this album. It has some great upbeat songs especially &quot;What You See (Is What You Get). I also  loved her cover of the Rolling Stones song &quot;I Can't Get No  Satisfaction&quot;. I highly recommend this album!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney has finally done it. While her debut cd &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; spawned hits all over the place, the rest of the cd was just plain bubble gum filler with no depth. With her new cd &quot;Oops!...I Did  It Again!&quot;, Britney delivers 12 solid pop songs. From the beautiful  ballad &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot; all the way to her  cover of the Rolling Stone's &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot;,  Britney delivers solid performances. Can't wait to see how she will grow in  the coming years!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I actually heard this album/record before it was released! Andall I can say is &quot;it is da bomb&quot; It ain't shady and itdoesn't front!  hehehehe It has dance beats along with slow jams and r&amp;b! All the  tracks on this album is good! My fav is Lucky and I Can't Get No! As always  in between songs and tracks there are intros. All Brit- and non-Brit fans  should get this album because I think : &quot;oops! she did it  again&quot;!
B00004T0UT|4.0|Arguably Elvis' finest LP, here with contemporaneous bonus material, but all of this stuff was compiled last year on the SUSPICIOUS MINDS set (together with all the rest of the Jan/Feb '69 masters), so this release is  kinda superfluous, isn't it?
0312853238|1.0|At the risk of offending almost everybody in this review group, I'm simply going to highlight some SCIENTIFIC problems with this worthless novel.<br />(1)  Instantaneous communication.  The &quot;philotic parallax  instantaneous communicator&quot; - &quot;they can talk to each other even  when they're across the galaxy.  And the buggers can do it without  machines.&quot;  <br />The problem here, ladies and gentlemen, is action at a  distance.  As some of you may know (they teach this in high school) action  at a distance does not exist.  There is a finite, maximum velocity for the  transfer of information in the real world.  It's called the speed of light.   This is the whole point of special relativity.<br />I might add that by  bringing Mazer Rackham back as a twin-paradox (sending him out at  relativistic velocities so that the world aged 50 years but he only aged  eight) Card implies that he accepts special relativity.  But you can't have  it both ways.  Either you have special relativity or you have instantaneous  communication, but not both in the same novel.<br />(2)  Artificial gravity -  &quot;It could not land directly because Eros had enhanced  gravity.&quot;<br />Ladies and gentlemen, one cannot &quot;enhance&quot;  gravity.  As some of you may know, general relativity explains gravity in  terms of non-Euclidean geometry.  One can no more &quot;enhance&quot;  gravity than alter the truth of the Pythagorean theorem.<br />By the way,  check out the real Eros on the internet.  Look up &quot;NEAR&quot;.  Eros  was an unfortunate choice of asteroids for Card.  The real Eros is now  viewable by satelite.  He got the shape wrong!<br />(3)  Dr. Device - &quot;At  the focal point of two beams, it sets up a field in which molecules can't  hold together anymore.  Electrons can't be shared . . . Then the field dies  down, the molecules come back together, and where you had a ship, you now  have a lump of dirt with a lot of iron molecules in it.  No  radioactivity.&quot;<br />Excuse me?  The &quot;beams&quot; create a  &quot;field&quot; that disrupts matter at the level of electrons . . . then  matter reassembles and you get, not hydrogen and helium, but  &quot;dirt&quot; and &quot;iron&quot;, without radiation?<br />Ladies and  gentlemen, this contradicts the second law of thermodynamics, the laws of  chemistry, and the laws of quantum mechanics all at the same time.<br />(4)   Eugenics.  Ender is the product of a genetic experiment; his brother and  sister are smart too.<br />Ladies and gentlemen, eugenics is a discredited  science.  The most famous twentieth-century proponent of eugenics, Adolph  Hitler, murdered six million people and committed suicide.  That should  tell you something.  Think about it.<br />By the way, isn't this whole book a  rip off of the ideas of Robert A. Heinlein and A.E. Van Vogt?<br />. . . .  .<br />Interested readers may wonder why I took the time to write a diatribe  against a children's book.  I love science fiction, and there are so many  good books out there, but this is not one of them . . .<br />This book was  required reading for my 14-year-old daughter who was about to enter ninth  grade.  I object to this. It sets a bad precedent.  Encouraging wishful  thinking in children is not what education is all about.  I can't believe  that her English teachers selected this book out of all of the millions of  books in the world's literature.  Sloppy wishful magical adolescent  thinking epitomized.  A book for dumb teenagers.  Good Grief!
0783225903|5.0|This film is bursting with originality and intelligence. Immensely entertaining and filled with black comedy, but it is also a feats for the eyes; the set designs are breathtaking and Gilliam's version of a  duct-infested future, while it is frustrating to even imagine this becoming  our reality, it is one of the most possible scenarios for the next century.  The dream sequences are unique and add the 'Fantasy' element to the film.  Jonathan Pryce is perfect as the wimpy day-dreaming Sam Lowry and delivers  a great performance. Ian Holm and Michael Palin are also great in support.  Robert DeNiro and Bob Hoskins also lend a hand as duct engineers from  opposite sides. May also appeal to sci/fi fans. Brilliant mind-bending  vision that is also funny, smart, witty and entertaining. From a scale of  1-10 I give this film a 9!
630575067X|5.0|I am so tired of the criticism Episode I is receiving, because it is actually one of the most beautiful movies ever made. And I'm not only talking about the visuals here. I could go into an extremely lengthy  explanation of why I think this, but I think I'd be wasting my time. The  bottom line is that Lucas has tried something a bit different but still  very much in the spirit of Star Wars. Instead of continuing down the beaten  path, he has expanded the universe with a more serious side. We get to see  political intricacies, a *real* queen (instead of the gung-ho Leia) and  Jedi Knights in peak condition. Brilliant film, and a very good prologue  for Episode II and III. Brilliant acting (maybe except for our little  Anakin played not too convincingly but still quite charmingly by Jake  Lloyd) by all cast members. Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor  stand out in particular. Amazing soundtrack by John Williams. And -yes I  really mean this- wonderful storyline that hints skillfully at greater  things to come. And for the record, I *have* seen the original trilogy  countless times, but I think Episode I is right up there with it in terms  of quality.  And maybe *gasp* even higher :) Well done Lucas!
B00004SCX6|2.0|Can Britney's fans really be honest with themselves or does Britney's music simply appeal to those who just don't have any good taste in music?  My roommate purchased the album yesterday and as I was listening I told  myself to really give it a shot and to listen with out prejudice.  Well the  verdict is in and it's not good.  Maybe I'm too old (22 yr.old,) to  appreciate what Britney brings to the table, musicaly speaking- for that I  thank God!   For those who are claiming &quot;she did it again...&quot;  what exactly did she do aside from contribute to the world of bad music?
B000B5XOXY|3.0|For a time, \\"Batman Forever\\" was my fave flick of the franchise. Sadly, the years haven't been kind to my opinion (and ranking) of the movie. Originally, I enjoyed it for the oddly over-the-top performances by Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones as the Riddler and Harvey Two-Face, respectively. But as time went on, their performances were more silly than they were genuinely funny. I also didn't much care for Two-Face's cartoonish makeup job; I think they shoulda tried to give it a more realistic look. Still, these guys' scenery chewing is still somewhat enjoyable in parts... and occasionally embarrassing in others. `Course, it's usually the villains that have all the charisma in super-hero flicks, so I guess the overdone performances were par for the course... <br /> <br />All in all, \\"Batman Forever\\" is a wee bit like the classic 1960s TV show, but not quite as campy or corny, though it would get pretty close at times (eventually going WAY overboard in the subsequent \\"Batman & Robin\\"). Howzabout Batman's drive up the side of a skyscraper to escape the charge of Two-Face? Too much. And Batman's rescuing of the Gotham City 2nd National Banks' vault and security guard was pretty hokey, too. And did they really have to have Robin say a \\"holy\\" line that was completely unnecessary? Well, at least they finally threw Robin into the Batman movie pantheon... <br /> <br />In fact, if there's one moment that defines the entire flick, it's the final showdown where the Riddler asks Batman, \\"Was I over the top? I can never tell!\\"  <br /> <br />You sure were, Jimmers. You sure were. <br /> <br />The 2-DVD special edition release includes all sorts of making-of and behind-the-scenes docs, as well as deleted scenes, and a feature-length commentary track by director Joel Schumacher. I actually enjoyed the director commentary for the most part, especially his response to folks who thought the addition of nipples to the bat-suits was ridiculous: \\"(These people) need to get out more.\\" Obviously, this man didn't understand the demographic a super-hero flick attracts, ya know? We're talkin' folks who live in the basement of their parents' house well into their thirties... and pick apart every little nit on every Bat-flick that comes out, and how they always end up short of Batman creator Bob Kane's vision of the character. Never mind that Kane was on the set of the movie on several occasions, and--judging from some of the behind-the-scenes footage-- appeared to be having the time of his life... <br /> <br />In the commentary, Schumacher did defend his intent to move the franchise away from the dark and brooding batman flicks that Tim Burton put out. He wanted to make things a little lighter, as well as give the folks an entertaining popcorn adventure that didn't require too much thought. I must admit that he did succeed to a decent degree on that count... <br /> <br />Then there are the behind-the-scenes and making-of docs, which cover... well, the making of the movie, from the bat-casting to the bat-gadgets to the batmobile to the nurply bat-suits to the rest of the sets. What I found most interesting, however, was the collection of deleted scenes, many of which were part of a subplot that was ultimately abandoned. One of the scenes, featuring Val Kilmer's Bruce Wayne confronting a giant bat with glowing red eyes, looked downright corny. Thank goodness they left it out... <br /> <br />'Late...
B000002LAB|5.0|I got into Miles through this album and have since collected most of his albums. Tutu for me is the outstanding track. Whoever heard a drum machine swing like this before? Much credit has to be given to Marcus Miller for  what he has created here. As the credit notes say, &quot;Miles Davis -  Trumpet all other instruments Marcus Miller except indicated&quot;. You  could call this a Miller album. I don't think there is a weak track here.  Even George Duke's Backyard Ritual is a treat. Portia the ballad is  fantastic. Just listen to the outro, it is an inspired piece of composing.  Listen to the chords on this album and if you can, work them out. It'll  change they way you think about harmonies and chord progressions. Perfect  Way is an interesting choice. It's a cover of Scritti Politti's tune. To  date still my favourite electric Miles album. A must for any lover of  fusion or funk. If I was stranded on a desert island with my Discman, this  album would be with me. 5 stars
0767849493|2.0|Kevin Smith keeps THREATENING to become a serious moviemaker.  *Chasing Amy*  was an attempt to examine an adult, realistic relationship . . . *Dogma*  is an attempt to examine  (under a satirical cover)  Christianity.   Don't worry, though:  there's nothing challenging here, nothing really  controversial, nothing for adults over 30.<br />It's about a couple of fallen  angels  (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck phoning it in)  who have found a way to  re-enter Heaven . . . problem is, Existence itself would cease if their  plan succeeds, but that suits our comic villains to a  &quot;T&quot;.   Anyway . . . God  (a She, bet on it -- one of Smith's several half-hearted  attempts to  &quot;shock&quot;  you in this movie)  drafts a woman who is  supposed to be Jesus'  great-great- etc.- grandniece, or something, to stop  the wicked angels.  The woman is played by Linda Fiorentino, who somehow  keeps getting work, despite being such a clearly bad actress.<br />Tired?  I  know I was.  Smith says in interviews that he's a serious Christian, and  this movie sure proves it.  There's actually very little that's satirical  here, now that I think about it.  Smith, with his George Carlin character,  is supposedly taking swipes at the notion of  &quot;user-friendly&quot;   religion  (a  &quot;new&quot;  &quot;Buddy&quot;  Christ), but then he  turns around and commits the same sins as Carlin's goofy priest:  a bad  rock singer as God;  the Damon-Affleck thing;  various cool   &quot;Gen-X&quot;  actors;  and so forth.  In fact, I have never seen a  more user-friendly religion-movie in my life.  Nor have I seen Christianity  better marketed to our spendthrift youth  (I wasn't paying attention, but  I'm sure the soundtrack is suitably cool).  In the future, Smith should  stick to subjects which make him less eager to placate.  *Chasing Amy*   wasn't made with audience tests, marketing, and touchy Disney execs in mind  . . . and it's much the better movie.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Galaxy Quest is a charming and good-hearted parody of the old sci-fi television shows we know and love, particulary the original &quot;Star Trek.&quot; Tim Allen plays the bombastic, Shatneresque lead star of an old  Sci-Fi series (&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;) that has developed a cult  following. Allen and the rest of the crew haven't had a decent part since  the series faded 18 years ago, and subsist by making paid appearances at  Trekkie-like fan conventions. Life goes on, until one day, REAL aliens  appear and whisk the Galaxy Quest stars off to lead an intergalactic war  with an evil invader.(The aliens have intercepted TV transmissions of the  old series and believe them to be &quot;historical  documents&quot;  recording the exploits of an actual spaceship and crew.) Plenty of laughs  and sci-fi in-jokes abound as Allen and his castmates stumble through their  alien adventures, trying hard not to disappoint their adoring alien hosts  -- who've thoughtfully constructed a spaceship for them to operate that's  an exact replica of the one on the show. Allen is more than adequate as the  posturing star who suddenly has to become a real hero, and Sigourney Weaver  is terrific as a bosomy blond crew-mate who always leads with her  &quot;best pair.&quot; Alan Rickman plays the Spock-like &quot;Dr.  Lazarus&quot; with hilarious disdain. The real stars, however, are the  naive, hero-worshipping aliens -- the way they talk and walk is both  hilarious and heart-breaking. I can't imagine anyone not liking this film;  there's enough here to entertain even people who don't normally like sci-fi  films or TV shows. The DVD &quot;extras&quot; include out-takes and  dialogue translated into &quot;Thermian&quot; (the aliens' helium-like  language.)
630575067X|1.0|Yeah I know... there's already nearly a thousand Amazon user reviews about this movie. I figured I might as well put my two cents in along with everyone else. I got nothin' better to do anyway...<br />Having been a big  geekin' fanboy of the original trilogy, my twisted sense of loyalty to  George Lucas's little galaxy far, far away had me at the multiplex waiting  to see Episode I. Two weeks after its premiere of course. Hey, I might be a  maven of the `Wars, but I sure as hell wasn't gonna stand in a miles-long  line for five hours just to see one of the very first showings. I might be  a loser, but I'm not that far gone!<br />I should have read the warning signs.  I can usually tell how good or bad a movie's gonna be by viewing the  theatrical trailer for it. After seeing Episode I's preview before 'Star  Trek: Insurrection' came on (yep, I cut both ways), I was less than  excited. But, I decided to give the film a fair shake. After all, it is  written, produced, and directed by one of the most successful filmmakers in  cinema history. Perhaps it'll be an exception to my \\"Rule of Movie Trailer  Viewing\\".<br />Unfortunately, in this instance, I should have gone with my  better judgment. To start off, I thought there were way too many CGI  effects, and a few of them looked downright bad.  One example of this was  at the movie's beginning, a panoramic shot of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon taking a  thirty-foot leap from a vent shaft and landing on the deck of the Trade  Federation flagship's cargo bay. Also, whenever I viewed a scene made up  mostly or entirely of Computer effects, it looked to me to be more like a  glorified animated feature than live-action. Three examples: the Gungan -  Trade Fed droid battle; Qui-Gon, Obi Wan, and Jar Jar Binks's escape from  the ocean monsters; and someome parts of the Boonta pod race were less  convincing to me as well. Don't get me wrong, I think CGI effects have  great potential, and the look and realism keeps getting better; I justdon't think the medium has advanced enough yet to look absolutely and  uncannily realistic. I'm still a big fan of using physical models, like  what was used in the original Star Wars flicks, in space movies.  I guess  I'm just an old fogey at heart.<br />And boy, did they ever pump up the hype  on Darth Maul! He was Episode I's coolest- looking character, yet he was  seen for maybe ten minutes overall! And, after being able to fend off two  opponents with some amazing martial arts skills and split-second reactions,  he just stood there when Obi-Wan leapt and cut him down! This guy, with  lightning-fast moves and force-heightened awareness, was somehow unable to  dodge getting split when he had almost two seconds of time to react? I'm  sorry, I just can't buy that.  But there was some good to come out of it-  the lightsaber \\"duel\\" between Maul and Qui-Gon &amp; Obi-Wan was admittedly  the best Star Wars \\"sword\\" fight yet.<br />Also, as far as I can see, this  trilogy as it unfolds is gonna be a downer to view. Think about it... we'll  eventually be witnessing the fall of the Republic, the rise of Chancellor  Palpatine and the Empire, the turning of Anakin into Darth Vader, and the  killing off of nearly all of the Jedi Knights.  I do not relish the  prospect of the other prequels depressing me with the horrible events to  come. Pass the prozac, please...<br />Then there's Jar Jar Binks. The way I  see it, if G.L. wanted so badly to have slapstick humor in the movie, he  should've put in an intermission with a Looney Tunes short. I consider him  to be one of the most useless and pathetic characters to ever sully the  silver screen. Of course, I've voiced my thoughts to a few Star Wars fanboy  cronies, many of whom thought I was insane to knock the `Jar. They even  went so far to state that his purpose was to be annoying; that's why he's  there. Yeesh. It's pretty sad when one comes up with logic like that to try  and justify a widely reviled character's existence. All I can say is, when  I see Gilbert Gottfried in a movie, I know that his purpose is to be  annoying, too. Yet it doesn't necessarily make it more enjoyable; usually,  the opposite effect occurs.<br />Actually, I have an idea for offing the  Jar-man REALLY early in Episode II. You know how each Star Wars movie  starts with the opening \\"Story So Far\\" crawl? Well, for Episode II, I see  it falling downward, rather than up. J.J.'s at the bottom of the screen,  lashed to a gurney, fully restrained, waiting for the bottom edge of the  crawl to decapitate him. But this time, it comes downward much more slowly  than usual. Everybody in the theatre endures the excruciatingly long, yet  strangely satisfying, moment as it reaches its climax... and then...hee hee...  AND THEN...HAHAHAHA! <br />Uh, I gotta go now... the orderly has just arrived  with my Thorazine and lithium chaser.<br />`Late...
B00004T8RK|5.0|This is not your typical PJ album.  I would even dare to say that it is more experimental than No Code, at least in terms of song structure.  The obvious highlights of the album (in my own opinion) are Light Years,  Nothing As It Seems, Thin Air, Grievance and Rival.  Thin Air and Grievance  are two completely different songs from the end of the musical spectrum,  with the latter being a heavy rock-punk riffer while the former is a sweet  delicate song along the lines of Wishlist. Don't buy this album expecting  Ten or Vs.  Think of it as a cross between Yield and Vitalogy.  Vedder's  voice is better than ever and he even breaks out the ukelele for Soon  Forget.  &quot;THE&quot; most relevant and important band of today breaks  through with another rock and roll masterpiece.  Buy it now!
078322608X|5.0|After purchasing this edition of the film, I have not been able to go a day withought watching it. There is so much to latch on to; the cinematography, acting, and general directing...and so many different ways  to interpret its ending. &quot;The Hamster Factor&quot; is a must for fans  of the film as well as anyone who likes Gilliam's work...My only complaint  is that in this edition there is no feature to view Chris Marker's &quot;La  Jete&quot; which inspired &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;...however, i would rather  have this edition with &quot;hamster factor&quot; than one with  &quot;jete&quot; and no &quot;hamster&quot;...so if you love this film buy  this DVD...if you haven't seen this film rent it, then buy this DVD...

6303997198|4.0|I've read enough trash heaped on the novel that I'm definitely going to have to gather a superhuman amount of strength to form my own opinion about it. Probably never will read it actually. The movie, however, was not half  so bad as many of the informed opinions implied. What we get is a so-so  romance novel depicted by actors (Streep and Eastwood) who know entirely  what they are about. Eastwood is not doing his normal turn here. He is  showing us that he has some vulnerability to expose, after all. The tin man  has a heart. Streep is Streep. I don't care if she is the lead in a Betty  Boop Cartoon, she is going to make it interesting. Maybe the plot is  offensive in a Southern Baptist sense of the term; the story plays on the  screen. Eastwood shows a great deal of dexterity in directing this little  treat. He's not pretending to be Truffaut. Just a simple narrative, told  from a simple perspective.
6305903182|5.0|Scream 3 was amazing. At first I wasn't to sure what i'd thinkof it... But I should have listened to my inner voice which alwayssays &quot;Don't trust movie critics!&quot;. If you haven't seen the first 2, then hire them out and watch. Then go and see the third. You'll be pleased you did. If you have seen the previous 2 then what are you waiting for!  Thanks for reading....
B00004SCX6|2.0|I can't believe the lows the music world has sunk to!  I swear you can sing &quot;Baby one more time' along with at least three songs on the album including &quot;Oops&quot;.  I think she should sue herself for plagurism.   The only thing that has gotten better then the first album is her ability  to sing through her nose.  The songs off the first album I could tolerate  when they were on the radio but I have to change the channel instead of  listening to &quot;oops&quot;.  At least the commercials don't grate on my  nerves.  The only reason I gave it two stars was because the version of  &quot;Satisfaction&quot; was actually ok, just a little long.
B0000026UL|5.0|Never, ever write Dylan off! Oh Mercy and Time Out of Mind are exhibits A and B. Yes Dylan had put out some lackluster albums before and after this release, but no, he will never be dead musically until he is dead  physically.<br />On to this magnificent album! Dylan and Lanois create a dense  sound that serves the lyrics well. It opens with Political World, which is  as sharp and relevant as any of Dylan's more famous protest tunes. The real  highlight for me is &quot;Most of The Time&quot; a song that is as  bittersweet as anything from Blood On The Tracks. Some may say that the  lyrics are too repetitive, but it  actually makes the man's lyrics more  effective. For example, the repetition of most of the time accentuates the  scenario of a man who lies to himself. Every single track is strong. If  you're a new to Dylan, by all means get Blood On the Tracks, Blonde on  Blonde, and Highway 61 first! If you already are a fan, this is an absolute  must for your Dylan collection. Bottom line: buy it!
B000002IZM|5.0|Several years separate this and &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, Vangelis's last masterpiece release. But when turned loose on Ridley Scott's dark, futuristic cinematic vision, Vangelis delivered a score that aptly  encapsulates the 'feel' of the film; even when he turns to cheesier pop  elements, when taken in their proper context, they fit nicely. This, along  with Klaus Schulze's &quot;Body Love&quot; and Tangerine Dream's  &quot;Thief&quot;, is a defining document in the use of electronic music  for film-scoring. Annoyingly unavailable for some time after the film's  release, this is a significant improvement over the orchestrated  'soundtrack' that was released instead. Definitely one of the 'must-have'  soundtracks of the 1980s.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I just got this cd from the store this morning and then I popped it in my cd player. Britney sounds so much better than on her last album! She really  has grown up! I really love her cover version of (I Can't Get No)  Satisfaction. If pop has grown to this level already I can't wait to see  what else the future holds for it.
B000000NN4|4.0|The problem with this album is that it comes on the heels of the previous  and very strong &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, which is one of Vangelis's  high-points. That album really set a standard for this sort of  soundtrack-ish material, and as such, anything following it is like to  appear diminshed by comparison. But then again, some of what is here is  really weaker, such as the title track, and the reliance on the Greenwich  talking clock that occurs at a couple of places really seems a bit mawkish.  And overall, the composition work here appears to be a bit off of  &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;'s mark...but then, that really was a masterwork  piece, and certainly a difficult act to follow. But the performances here  are, once again, top-notch from one of the best synthesists of the 70s and  80s. Well worth picking up.
B000000WJZ|5.0|When reviewing a CD, it's difficult sometimes to balance its immediate appeal with its lasting appeal.  Unlike a book, a good CD must be listened to over and over, and must not grow stale.  Trying to judge the quality of  a recently released recording without giving it the test of time really  only amounts to half a review.  It takes some perspective to be truly  objective.<br /> But Siamese Dream has it all.  Over a period of seven years,  it has continued to be fresh and original.  This tour de force is a  one-of-a-kind treasure, among the Pumpkins albums and among rock music.<br />  Immediate appeal?  I was driving home from work one day in 1993 and I heard  Cherub Rock on the radio.  I had no idea who Smashing Pumpkins were at the  time; all I know was that I was completely floored.  I simply had to own  this!  The driving force of the music and the melodic hooks held me like  flypaper.  Never had I heard such overwhelming power and delicate  restraint, not just in the same song, but at the exact same time.  As soon  as the song ended, I turned around and went and bought the disc.  No other  time have I had that sort of reaction.<br /> Lasting appeal?  This disc never  leaves my car.  Rarely does a week go by when I don't listen to this  through beginning to end.  Somehow it has never grown old.  I can't think  of a single other album that has given me as much enjoyment in my entire  life.<br /> So if you are at all a fan of this genre and don't own this disc,  buy it.  Even if you have been disappointed by their weaker recent efforts,  buy it.  The test of time has indicated that this CD is destined to be a  true classic.  Quite simply, it is the best album of the nineties.
0446386898|5.0|It is ironic that one of the greatest pieces of literature produced in the last 50 years is a comic book. What's tragic is that many people dismiss Watchmen because of that very fact.<br />Comic Books are for kids aren't  they? Casper, Archie, Richie Rich...sure maybe Superman. But they're not to  be taken seriously. Are they?<br />If you harbor these feelings do yourself a  favor--put aside your prejudice and read this book. This is a complex  commentary on modern society. From the opening statements in Rorshach's  Journal to the final pages, this story is both disturbing and  poignant.<br />Other reviewers have accurately said that it is the best work  of its genre, that its art, story, and characterization are vivid and  arresting, but that falls short of describing the story's true impact. If  there were a list of ten great books being put into a time capsule to  identify us as a people, Watchmen, by its own merits, should be included.
B00000JCOV|5.0|OK,so, i bought this album after hearing Spit it Out once. Thats how great this album is. Then i listened to the rest of the album. Some good songs, mostly boring ones. i would recommend this album to everybody. Plus,  Slipknot has sold out.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I think that the CD is pretty good, untill you come to &quot;Satisfaction&quot;. This song by The Rolling Stones is an excellent ROCK &amp; ROLL song but it does not belong on a Britney Spears CD. This is  a song with a real band. I like Britney Spears' song but she should not  cover this song. Otherwise the CD is really good.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears &quot;did it again&quot; with her second album &quot;Oops I Did It Again&quot;.  In this album- listeners can tell that Britney has grown from her &quot;Hit me one more time&quot; days and has proved herself  as a talented singer.  With her last album selling over 12 million copies-  we can be sure that this one will do as well- hopefully even better.  Her  first single &quot;Opps I....again&quot; is played non-stop on all local  radio stations and after listening to this album- I can tell you she is  going to have another great year of tours and shows.  Buy this album today  and lets make Ms. Spears' second album out-sell her last one.  12 times  platinum- can we do it?- Sure we can!
B00004SCX6|5.0|She's done it twice she's hit the shelves(again). She's made another great hit that went to #1 (of course). She's made another great hit she's done it twice she's working on her next hit it's going to be a great one.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears new album does show that Yes, she can do it again! Britney works with a lot of big time song writers and producers. Shania Twain writes four songs for Britney Including ''Dont Let Me Be The Last To  know'', ''Lucky'', ''Dont Go Knockin On My Door'' and ''Dear Diary''.  Britney also co wirtes two songs on this record with ''Dear Diary'' and  ''Stronger''. This album is like a mariah carey album..its so personal and  it tells a story if you listen closley enough. When you get this  album...you will be amazed that there is a secret track after Dear  Diary...the song is called ''Sunflower'', this song was writen by Mairah  Carey, this song is a cute personal song..its about a girl who begins to  bloosom into a star....its a great song. Get this album you wont be mad!  Britney sohws us all that she is a STAR....and she will be around for a  long time.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I love Oops! I did it again, but its not as good as baby one more time.  I think Britney is trying a little too hard to make Oops! as good as baby one more time.  The cd is great though :-)
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops i did it again, is a Display of RAW Talent.  Britney shows she can not only hold the spotlight, but continue to improve her Talent. Her new album is Awesome.  To rap this review up, It would be safe to say  &quot;Britney Has Done It Again&quot;
B000005S37|5.0|Whether you consider \\"Metal Machine Music\\" to be groundbreaking art that was years ahead of its time or a major bird-flip to everyone in sight, the fact is: it works. As art, as a statement, as a genuine piece of Lou Reed mischief. Sixty minutes of pure amplifier feedback and nothing else, complete with stream of consciousness liner notes and even a chemical equation on the album jacket.     \\"Metal Machine Music\\" is not unlike the ambient stylings of today's avant garde electronic artists (turntablist DJ Spooky comes to mind), or even a raw version of early Eno. Reed insisted (in an interview with Lester Bangs) that there were melodies from Beethoven's \\"Eroica\\" and other classical pieces embedded in the harmonic structure (in fact, RCA almost released the album on their classical label!). Reed later admitted the classical angle was nonsense.     It seems a safe bet to view this album as Reed's cynical anti-art statement to a fawning public, prompted by the popularity of \\"Rock n Roll Animal\\" and \\"Sally Can't Dance\\" - two commercial successes that preceded \\"Metal Machine Music\\", and both of which  Reed has since disowned.     The fact that this album exists is one of the most delicious pieces of absurdity in the history of music. Who among us is too humorless to take a practical joke? Everyone should own this, if only as a reminder to not take life so seriously. Listen to it while folding the laundry, or while contemplating the meaning of life - it's all the same thing anyway, isn't it?
B00004T8RK|4.0|Okay, I've been a die hard PJ fan since the first time I heard Ten..it  seems odd that it was almost a decade ago.  I have loved every one of their  albums.  Apart from this one, I would give them all 5 stars.  My favorite  is still Yield, which I think is one of the best albums of the 1990's,  right up there with The Bends, Achtung Baby, and To Bring You My Love.  Ten  was a scorchingly great album too.  What all of the previous PJ records  have had though, is a unity and cohesiveness.  The albums felt like they  were complete.<br />Admittedly I've only listened to Binaural a couple of  times, and I'm sure that my opinion will change, but early on this record  seems very disoriented.  I have heard countless reviews claiming its  experimentality is brilliant.  However, I find it a little distracting.  There are, however, so many great elements to this cd that I still have to  give it high marks.  Breakerfall and Nothing as it Seems are remarkable  singles.  <br />Overall as an album though, it does not move me the way other  PJ cds  have.  It seems to skip around with its intentions.  There are a  couple of songs that I don't like at all.  (gods' dice is one)  There are  some great gems on here too.  Ed on the ukelele is a treasure.  <br />I would  reccommend this album for all Pearl Jam fans. If you aren't a big fan and  would like an introduction, I think Yield is a far more superior--and safe  choice.  I am all for the evolution and maturity of a band. Experimentation  is a great tool for growth too.  I am willing to accept that this cd may be  that experimental catalyst that pushes Pearl Jam to greater things in the  future...but for now I am a little disappointed.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Brilliant, graphic, intense, romantic, eerie, and wonderful art direction.  The acting is quite good and this &quot;R&quot; rated version of the Washington Irving story is a facinating experience.  Much better than I had  expected, and I am willing to bet for most who have not yet seen this film,  it will be better than you expect as well.
6305627347|5.0|this movie is funny as hell.the songs get a little old but cartman keeps it going.if you are a fan of the show u will luv this.if you are really religous or offened easily u probally won't like it.
0553212443|5.0|Dicken's A Christmas Carol is a classic that we often see retold every Christmas.  Everyone loves it, but few people have actually read it for themselves.  I always prefer reading then viewing the story because then I  have to use my own imagination.  I would recommend to anyone that at least  once they should read the story.  Dickens is a wonderful writer although a  bit longwinded (He was paid by word when he wrote!).
B0000027RL|5.0|I'd say Pearl Jam was at it's best with Ten.  You just can't get any better with songs like      &quot;Jeremey&quot;, &quot;Deep&quot; and &quot;Oceans&quot;.  This group is really cool. Keep up the Music boys!
B00000J7RZ|2.0|I was really looking forward to this one, i was quite dissapointed. The songs 'If you had my love, 'Waiting for tonight' and 'Let's get loud' are good. But the rest of the album is basically furball love songs which you  should be prepared to choke on, don't even buy this album even if you ADORE  love songs, as these are BAD love songs. Just buy the singles instead, or  tape it off someone who was unfortuanate enough to buy it. Actually there  is two extra songs on the British version, 'baila' and 'Do you know where  you're going to'. Baila was quite good but, BUT, the theme from mahogany  was quite frankly slaughtered by Jennifer introducing latin instruments and  whiny singing, euuuurrrgghhh!
B000002BE9|5.0|Fiona Apple is so amazing!  Who would have thought a nineteen year old could sing like this and write songs like these!   They're all sooo deep and moving!  Everyone should give Fiona a chance!  she's awesome.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I thought this was a very good album. It was better than BOMT. It has ballads and it was time she did one. I reccomend this CD to everyone!
B00004STPT|5.0|I really loved the movie Gladiator, and this soundtrack takes you right back to it. Great for any fan of the movie.
B00000FCBC|2.0|Only the CD with the old covers is worthwhile. The new one is horrible, with bad song selection, played without heart, almost in remote control. Another clever step by recent money-lovers Hetfield and Ulrich..
B00004SCX6|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of Britney Spears, but i had a chance to listen to this album yesterday and its actually quite good. There are a few songs which i think will do quite well on the charts, and i'm sure this album will sell  quite well. If you like popular music this would be something to buy.
B00002Z88D|1.0|Im a Metallica fan (read: until &quot;AND JUSTICE FOR ALL..) I have nothing agains classical music,knowing that so much metal musicians were inspired by it. I like it. I even have a few classical CDs. But the sound  in this album is terrible. It seem that Kamen didnt make arrangments at  all, it seem that the band is fighting against the orchestra all the time !  I is ennerving, noisy, bad. I never heard the album again..
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears has done it again! Her new album,  &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; tops her debut album  &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; in everyway possible. <br />Oops!...I Did It Again- (5/5) A great first single;  catchy beat, nice hook; great dance track!<br />Stronger- (5/5) Very  futuristic type song; great voice effects, nice melody, and killer  beats.<br />Don't Go Knockin' On My Door- (5/5) A very r&amp;b/ urban type  song. Great harmony!<br />(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction- (5/5) A great remake  of the Rolling Stone's hit with Brit's own flair!<br />Don't Let Me Be The  Last To Know- (5/5) A great ballad with a counrty flair that really shows  her vocal talent!<br />What U See (Is What U Get)- (5/5) A great track with an  r&amp;b hint. Very catchy!<br />Lucky- (5/5) The best track on the album;  shows the downside of fame; great lyrics!<br />One Kiss From You- (5/5) The  sencond best track here! Great, more mellow song to relax to.<br />Where Are  You Know- (4/5) A nice ballad, but rather depressing; good vocals!<br />Can't  Make You Love Me- (5/5) A great, very infectious pop tune, flirtatous  mood.<br />When Your Eyes Say It- (4/5) A very light ballad; not much vocal  show.<br />Dear Diary- (3/5) The worst track on the album. Brit's first  co-write. Very dreary.<br />Overall, &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again is a great  album, not to be overlooked!
6303997198|1.0|This movie will make you fall asleep as sure as a sleeping pill, if you don't take it away first from your VCR, due to anger !  It's one of the boriest thing I've ever watched. I rented it due to the cast, knowing fully  well that it was a romance. But, what a deception!  THe plot never flies,  never gives anything fresh and new, it's always Streep with her old style  of acting. And Clint... well, I prefer Dirty Harry...
B000003TB6|4.0|This album is much more instrumental and jazzy than the other Roots albums. Distortion to Static, What Goes On, I Remain Calm are the best songs on the disc, with What goes on showcasing. But Proceed, Mellow My  Man, Datskat and Silent Treatment are good as well. Compared to Roots  satndards, some of the songs are not as dynamic as some of the others, but  compared to other artsist, their great. I wouldn't buy this album for a fan  who is new to the Roots. I would start with things fall Apart, and work my  way backwards.Then you could better appreciate the creative and unique  music on this disc, cause after all, it is 6 years old, even the  instramental sound give it a sense of timelesness. You'll be kickin  yourself asking what you've been missing.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I had heard about this album all through the summer of 1999 and bought it on impulse in New York - cost me twenty-one dollars, if I remember right.  But I didn't regret it. I'm not that good at describing artists - but I'm  sort of thinking a cross between Sarah McLachlan and Heather Duby.  (Heather's _Post to Wire_ is another good album, although sometimes a bit  too electronic for my tastes.)   The album starts off strong - &quot;Here  With Me&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot; make an interesting pair.  The first  one has Dido saying she wants to be with a certain guy - but in Track 2,  she's suddenly on the prowl.  I don't understand it - but who cares?  Lyrically, it's great.  The music can get a bit monotonous at times, I'll  admit - some of the songs sound the same - but not so much that you'll find  two songs you love and hate the rest.
B000023VR6|3.0|The only people eho are giving this album 5 stars are the people who are wishing that west coast rap  will jump into the forefront again. And it's going to take alot more than this to make that happen. Beside The Watcher  and X-Plosion, theirs nothing here that you'd remember past the lenth of  the album. Part of it is due to the lyrics. They talk about the same old  stuff, and they're so redundant it makes a Too Short verse about pimpin'  look new and innovative. And as far as Eminem playing the same roll as  Snoop did on the origonal Chronic? No. Snoop &amp; dre fit toghther like  hand and glove, and Snoop should've been on here more. The title alone on  this album was worth about two million in sales. Don't get me wrong, this  is a good album. Just don't expect it to be in your stereo six months from  now.
0140042520|5.0|Dharma Bums is a beautiful story, though there's no real plot to speak of -- no damsel in distress, no hero facing adversity, no complicated twists . . . it's just about life.<br />The reader follows the typical Kerouac  rucksacker as he floats along in his mid-twenties -- hiking the mountains  of the west coast, thumbing his way across the country and swapping  spiritual observations with Zen enthusiast and companion Japhy Ryder.<br />This book is a treasure, reminding the reader of the subtle beauties in  nature, conversation, travel and friendship. It's a perfect fit for any fan  of life.
1559408898|5.0|I don't have the Criterion Collection DVD, but from all the reviews I've read it doesn't sound like that big a deal.  So for now I will watch my video tape, and maybe get the regular edition on DVD someday.  Robocop is such a great movie.  I saw Robocop 2 first at a drive-in movie theatre, I  guess it was the summer of 1990.  I have to admit, i didn't know about  Robocop and I wasn't too thrilled to go see 2, but my friends wanted to go,  so I went.  The good thing about the drive-in (which has since been torn  down, btw...last one in NY too I think) was that you could party in your  car, know what I mean?  Anyways, long story short, I LOVED Robocop 2!    LOVED IT!  So I went home and the next day I rented Robocop and I loved it  more than 2 and it was good to see Robocop to get the history in order.  I  love the humor, it is bleak and sarcastic.  The effects are amazing.  The  dingy, dirty look of the city.  It just feels so...tacky!  My boyfriend  thinks it is so funny that I am such a RObocop freak.  I recommend it to  everyone, I make my friends watch it if they haven't seen it.  I wonder,  are there any other female Robocop fans out there?   (...)
0790729628|1.0|Everyone says its so great! I must have been watching a different movie. When it comes to movies I am one of those people that generally likes everything for what it is, if nothing else. This would have to be the  exception to the rule. Boring, slow, cheesey effects, almost no plot, and  the ending was unfulfilling at best. I've only seen the directors cut so I  guess I can't appreciate the 'improvement', but whats so good about a  polished version of a fundementally bad movie? Its like taking a class in  remedial reading and getting an A; sure its an A, but its not a very tough  class.
630587493X|3.0|Bicentennial Man is a good movie but where are the extras fot the DVD? Not even a trailer? This Robin Williams movie deserves better and DVD buyers deserve more for their money.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Does it matter if this is a good album or not? This could be the worst thing ever put on vinyl (uh!) and it would still sell and sell and sell more.  Britney Spears is a pretty girl (Girl!) and she has a strong presence on screen (the current princess of the music video), but her voice is nothing special. She seems to try hard to do what she can with her limited range, and her songs are mixed well enough to give her voice some strength, but there isn't much there.  Spears has nothing to do with music, she is all about marketing, hitting that niche, and she has done that; done that well. Her songs are nice pieces of pop that people can catch and hum, songs that kids will dance to because they have a good beat. Parents will not mind so much, because her music really is harmless.   For the album itself, it's fine. &quot;Oops! ... I Did It Again&quot; captures the &quot;One More Time&quot; feel that it was supposed to. Ballads like &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; and &quot;When Your Eyes Say It&quot; are nice, sure to be released as singles. The lyrics are what can be expected, nothing special, simple, to the point, adequate. She covers &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.&quot; It's okay. For some reason she decided to have dialogue on the album, I shall assume she is setting things up for her acting career. ---   Year after year these mindless melodies are thrown out at us at an ever increasing pace. From Britney to the Backstreet Boys, from Christina Aguilera  to N'Sync, we are offered the same old thing. Britney is just another young thang; Christina, just another Mariah (including wardrobe). Backstreet Boys, N'Sync ... please, what is the difference?  It's Pop, it's fun, for the most part, it's bad. I'll admit that I liked &quot;Baby One More Time,&quot; I'll admit that &quot;I Want It That Way&quot; had a &quot;something&quot; to it, but to be inundated with this, not trash, but fluff, is too much. You cannot turn on the radio without hearing another copycat, this label's jailbait, this label's Fab Four (Five). Even music that is halfway worthy of attention is Xeroxed 'til there is no more toner in the copier.  This fact of musical life will never change; it has been around since Mozart, but hopefully it can slow down so that we, the poor consumers, can catch up with what truly deserves recognition.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Well this cd is ok, but nothing exceptional. Almost all of the songs sound like the title track-Oops..I did it again. Still a worthwile investment , though.
6304602898|5.0|I must say, this is a real treat for all ages!  I thoroughly enjoy comedy that isn't funny, so this movie really hit the spot.  I'm also a incurable nut for cute gimmicky creatures who say charming lines and make adorable  little faces.  How marketable!  Not to mention the fact that disgusting,  sensless, slimy violence is funny and advances the plot tremendously.  Wow,  what a ride this one is! <br />I once wrote Kellogg's and asked them if they  would be interested in my idea for &quot;Gremlin's cereal&quot; where you  would eat little mugwai flakes and cocoon-like marshmallow treats.  They  didn't bite, but something tells me we have a winner waiting here folks!   (Just don't eat it after midnight...hehehe, those clever film  makers! )<br />Get this moving, fun-for-the-whole-family tale now and order  the ground-breaking &quot;Gremlins 2&quot; while you're at it.  If you  thrive on wasting chunks of your life, you won't be disappointed!
0201485672|5.0|The basic thesis of this book is that, for various reasons, real programs are poorly designed.  They get that way for a variety of reasons.  Initially well designed, extending the program may lead to software decay.   Huge methods may result from unanticipated complexity.  Refactoring,  according to Fowler, is a function preserving transformation of a program.   The transformations are reversible, so the intention is to improve the  program in some way.<br />Fowler suggests refactoring a program to simplify  the addition of new functionality. The program should also be refactored to  make it easier for human readers to understand at the same time.<br />He also  insists that each step is small and preserves functionality, and on  frequent unit testing with a comprehensive test suite.<br />Half of the book  consists of a catalogue of refactorings.  He gives each refactoring a  memorable name, such as &quot;Replace Type Code with Subclasses&quot;.  He  illustrates the design transformation with a pair of UML class diagrams,  and has a standard set of sections: Motivation, Mechanics and  Example.<br />The Motivation is a prose section that describes and justifies  the refactoring, showing the relationship to other refactorings.<br />The  Mechanics is a sequence of steps needed to carry out the refactoring, shown  as a list of bullet points  He expands on some points.<br />The Example is  where the value of this book lies.  Fowler takes a fragment of Java code,  and takes us step by step through the refactoring.  The code is small  enough that he can show it all each step of the way without overwhelming  us, but is large enough to be realistic.<br />The code is clear enough for  non-Java programmers to follow.  He explains his code well enough for the  book to function as a Java tutorial where the meaning of the code is not  obvious.  One or two of the refactorings are specific to the Java object  model, and do not apply to other languages.  Other languages would benefitfrom similar treatment, but there are very few language-specific  refactorings.<br />The book is very much of the Design Patterns movement, with  frequent references to patterns.  The aim of a factoring may be to achieve  a particular pattern, or it may take advantage of a particular pattern.   The book can be used as a tutorial on Design Patterns.<br />I have a small  number of complaints.  Fowler advocates the use of refactoring while  studying code for a code review.  One needs to be very sensitive to the  feelings of the programmer here, especially if he or she is a novice.  The  reviewer should read the code with refactoring in mind, and possible  refactorings recommended, but it is for the programmer to make the  changes.<br />Reading this book has inspired me to refactor some of my own  code.  My mistakes  underlined the need to take small steps, and to test  frequently.  I spent a day building a useful Delphi testing framework from  the description Fowler gives of the JUnit testing framework. The one  category of code that does not seem to lend itself to this approach is some  highly coupled parsing code.  While I can extract small blocks of code,  they remain tightly coupled with each other, and it is hard to give them  meaningful names.  The answer here may be to use the top down approach of  recursive descent, rather than the bottom up approach of refactoring.   Perhaps recursive descent can guide refactoring.  Refactoring is largely a  local approach.  One can almost say a pinhole approach.  Sometimes a global  view is needed.<br />In summary, I would say that this very good book would be  of use to Java programmers who have some understanding and much bafflement.  It is very good for us older dogs who have become a little jaded and need  some new ideas and motivation.
B0000042MY|5.0|This may the most beautiful music I have ever heard.<br />Does anyone remember that Trevor did the Excalibur score? Lets not forget &quot;The Siege of Camylarde&quot; (or however it's spelled) in that it is STILL the  most used piece in every movie trailor today. Trevor's da man, and this  score reaffirms it!
1573225517|3.0|This is a book about a guy who is in his 30s who acts like a 14-year old.  Maybe if I was a teenage it would be more exciting because it is very true to life of what it can be when life is really dull.  He even sits around  dreaming of the glory days when he was a dj and played Madonna songs.  To  no surprise his girlfriend gets fed up and moves out and then it takes a  whole book for him to understand that nobody wants to date a loser like  him.  Recommended for emotionally immature people and those under 20.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I've been a fan of Pearl Jam ever since Ten. When that record came out along with the rest of the grunge Seattle sence I was totally hooked on  Eddie's hard vocals. His voice was just so amazing. And now  comes Binaural  which sound nothing like Ten, Vs. or Vitalogy. It's more along the lines of  Yeild and No Code. But the great thing about Pearl Jam is over the years  they have change their style and not just kept with the same angry to the  world rock they once did. Binaural is a balance of a few short fast rock  tracks with the more laid back relaxing tracks. The first thing that caught  my eye on the CD was the fact that more tracks where written by Gossard and  Ament then before. Plus new drummer Matt Cameron from Soundgraden wrote the  music to Evauation. I peronally find every single Pearl Jam record amazing.  Why people say &quot;No Code&quot; was a disappointment is beyond me with  tracks like &quot;Hail, Hail, &quot;Off He Goes&quot;, &quot;Red  Mosquito&quot;, &quot;Smile&quot;? Binaural may not be filled with catchy  hooks that you might find of the radio but I frankly don't want another  &quot;Ten&quot;. Pearl Jam have done the bitter, angry music and now have  found peace. It's a same that music today is all about catchy hooks and  lame POP acts. Pearl Jam are &quot;REAL&quot; musicans with  &quot;REAL&quot; talent and the most amazing band of my time. And they are  also one of the best live bands. &quot;Live on Two Legs&quot; is a killer  live record. Call me a Pearl Jam mark but I love Binaural. Top tracks  &quot;Grievance&quot;, &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot;, &quot;Of the  Girl&quot;, &quot;Light Years&quot; and &quot;Nothing as it Seems&quot; So  support Rock music and buy this record!
0783226888|1.0|Wow.  Bruce Willis kisses a man and Richard Gere tries to be Irish.  All the while a nutty FBI agent played by Sidney Poitier uses his Russian sidekick to protect the First Lady.  The movie is a two hour bore.  The  characters are not developed and the story goes from nothing to less than  that.  Please do not waste your money.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Pathetic. Are you people normal? So what if she looks good, her songs are ALL the same. OK, I admit they are catchy and easy to listen to, and I can listen to it but I would never dream of giving my money for it. If you  really want to buy a new album, make it Binaural by Pearl Jam. Oh, and  she's not that good looking, she looks fake. Think about it, you can see  girls as good looking as her every day in the street (if you go out at  all).
B00004SCX6|1.0|I have always been a fan of &quot;good&quot; pop music, but this is so far from good it is not funny. The songs on the CD all sound alike, which makes for very boring listening. Ms. Spears vocals are far from good, she looks  like she still belongs on the Mickey Mouse Club when she is compared to  Celine Dion, Christina Aguillera, and Jennifer Simpson. If you were a fan  of Ms. Spears debut release then you might enjoy this dud, if you are not  don't waste your money.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I have been a Pearl Jam fan for a long time and while I will admit that they have changed their style over the years, but they have never given in and, I think, I respect that more than anything. I love the music and the  band and I think this album is one of the better ones. I'd like to see any  of the bands that have come out recently to last over ten years and still  keep it true to themselves and the fans. Thanks guys keep rockin!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney's new CD is a great buy.  If you liked her first, you'll love her second!  Besides the great single &quot;Oops...I Did It Again&quot;, Britney has a great selection, my favorites being &quot;Lucky&quot; and  &quot;What U See (Is What U Get)&quot;.  Great album!
0451197968|4.0|We should be grateful that Bachmann allowed SK to write in another form so much different from what readers boxed him to be - a horror storyteller.  I am no big fan of King but after looking at my book collections &amp;  reviewing the movies I have seen, I slowly realize that I have read &amp;  seen a lot of SK products.  &amp; I am proud to admit it. SK is a great  storyteller - be it pure gothic horror, a touch of supernatural forces,  mystery &amp; drama &amp; now, a futuristic sci-fi thriller.  Hail to you  SK!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Play this cd on an open highway while the sun is setting and bring someone along to pinch you!     This music is forever discovering new ways to please you!  A BEAUTIFUL cd to view the world with!
0452257743|3.0|So far, I have read (&amp; watched) Rage &amp; The Running Man.  In both stories, SK showed us his wide &amp; varying writing styles.  Readers will definitely tire of his stories if he compiles those with same plots &amp;  styles together.  Rage is patterned after Carrie -- almost too similar.   Characters, venue &amp; plot are continuation of the original  &quot;telekinetic&quot; novel.  As it was, it became too predictable.  With  the Running Man, it was quite different.  Here, SK gave us a glimpse of  what the future would be if dishonesty, greed &amp; poverty overtake the  world.  Our hero of course takes a strong hold at the center of the story -  an innocent being trapped in a &quot;greedy game&quot; where survival of  the fittest rules. Despite the absence of paranormal activities here,  violence still exists.  But the end redeems the entire story when good wins  over evil.  As it should be.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Binaural is definetely no TEN or VS., It lacks the  melodies and tempo that PearlJam became unanimous for in the 90s. Stone Gossard plays few solos, and Eddie Vedder, in my opinion, one of the best singers ever, sings  with little emotion, and barely showcases his unbelievable voice, as he has  before in songs like Yellow Ledbetter, and Alive. I'm still a huge Pearl  Jam fan, but Binaural is somewhat disappointing.
0375420525|5.0|I refer all those who gave this book a bad review to page ix. &quot;This is not for you.&quot; Some of you read it anyway because you thought that was just some funny gimmick or pretentious on the author's part. You've  discovered how wrong you were. I turned that page because I KNEW that it  was not for me. Or anyone. Yet should read it anyway. And I was not a bit  disappointed.<br />Forget Blair Witch, House of Leaves is a Post-Modern  &lt;you can't get away from that&gt; journey into madness. The writing is  brilliant ... and I don't just mean big words, I mean everything: spacing,  font, footnotes, interruptions, all of it. Give up the Blair Witch idea and  think Lovecraft and Nobakov because THOSE are Danielewski's true ancestors  when it comes to this book. <br />Not only is the book brilliant as a work of  fiction, but it is also a philosophical treatise of sorts, and espouses the  &quot;values?&quot; of Post-Modern philosophy at almost every turn.  <br />Finally, what a lot of people are missing is that the BOOK itself IS the  labyrinth. The Navidson Record might not exist, but every emotion and wrong  turn within that movie is really what the author imparts to the reader  through the medium of his book. <br />Danielewski, there are only two. Nabokov  and you. The rest are just reaching for straws.<br />Oh! So, should you read  it? Haha. No. Of course not. The author himself tells you that. No one  should read this book. It's not safe. It will change the way you look at  things. Especially the book you read AFTER finishing House of Leaves. Are  you going to anyway? I hope so, if you're like me.
B00000I8UF|5.0|Without a doubt Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers was the most exciting band I've heard in a live performance.  His week long gigs at the Keystone Korner in San Francisco were legendary.  Every one of his many groups were  outstanding though, propelling many of his &quot;youngsters&quot; into  careers of their own. <br />The group on this CD was one of the best. There  are many things that make this CD a real joy.  From the four original tunes  by Benny Golson and the title track by Bobby Timmons to the solid muscular  drumming of Blakey himself.  For me though there is one thing that  dominates this date----Lee Morgan.  Lee  Morgan absolutely rules.   Trumpeter Woody Shaw was once asked one of those interview questions, 'What  was your biggest influence?'  Without skipping a beat he said,  'The solo  Lee Morgan takes on &quot;Moanin&quot;.  Amen.  <br />From the very first  press roll off Blakey's snare  Morgan is launched.  Bolting out of the gate  this young artist is barely containable. The urgency of Art's drumming and  the rest of the team compels this dynamic trumpeter to dig deep, creating  flurry after flurry of spectacular rhythmic gymnastics, artfully blending  them with melodic ideas that just burst out.  His harmonic ideas on this  piece too are so sweet. Morgan pulls out all the stops, at times employing  his signature half valve technique, double tonguing, triple tonguing,  slurring, sliding, and just plain carving up the beat.  The elegant  construction of this gem of a solo has you sitting on the edge of your seat  in anticipation and at times in disbelief.  And what a tone!  Smooth,  round, big.<br />Lee's solo on the alternate track is a nice addition and  would have made a decent first cut if for some highly unfortunate reason  his masterpiece was never recorded. The rest of this CD is excellent too by  the way.  But oh man,  Lee Morgan!
630518299X|5.0|The Truman Show is the best movie since &quot;Ferris B. D. O.&quot;  I normally do not buy movies, for the same price of buying one, you can rent it for 4-5 times.  However, the Truman Show moved me in a way, no film ever  has.  It made me think...are we really in a fradulagent universe?  It is  truly an amazing work of motion picture and deserves 5 stars.<br />And  remember...Incase I dont see you again, good afternoon, good evening, and  good night
B00003CWL6|5.0|WOW! That's about the first word that poped into my mind when I saw the film. The second word was &quot;WOOOOOW&quot; and then the film was over. Time disapears when you're wathing a good movie. It would be a BIG shame to  say anything about the plot. The movie is a MUST SEE. It really gets under  your skin.  Now my only problem is: Where is the DVD version. I WANT MY DVD  - FAST!
0783242808|2.0|This movie just didn't have it. I wanted to love it (and laugh) but it just didn't ring true. Pales miserably compared to recent-year comedies like &quot;Bowfinger&quot; and &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;,  each of which have more laughs in 10 minutes than this whole film does.  Don't waste your time.
B00004T8RK|4.0|If NO CODE were ever to mate with VITOLOGY, I would envision this album resulting from the union.  Distant cousins  to some of the songs might be &quot;Glorified G&quot; and &quot;Do the Evolution,&quot; as &quot;Light  Years,&quot; comes across as a muffled, much lighter and more heart-felt  rendition of the former.  As for &quot;Do the Evolution,&quot; the album's  first three songs are all reminiscent but not match up to the standard of  the aforementioned rowdy masterpiece.  Pearl Jam has strayed far from the  grunge anthems of TEN, and it would seem doubtful that they will ever  return.  Instead, they have presented another edgy experiment, which shines  on such numbers as &quot;light years,&quot; &quot;thin air,&quot;  &quot;insignicance,&quot; &quot;grievance,&quot; and their opening single,  &quot;nothing as it seems,&quot; which all the critics have labeled  'haunting.'  Special mentions might be made for &quot;god's dice,&quot; and  &quot;parting ways&quot; as well.  The album flows better than their  previous efforts, as it predominantly utilizes the fade-out method to  introduce the next song that punches with a raucus drum beat, gentle chord,  or other opening technique.  The way &quot;god's dice&quot; jumps out of  the close of &quot;breakerfall&quot; makes it seem like an extension of the  same song, and is an intrigueing pace-setter that adds character early in  the album by somehow blending the distinctively different qualities of the  two songs.  Another notable entance would be the growling that kicks off  &quot;rival,&quot; which is successfully blended with the initial drum  beat. There are none of the trippy tack-fillers that plagued VITOLOGY and  appeared as a red dot on YIELD, and we can be grateful to Pearl Jam that  they chose actual songs for all of the tracks on the album.  All that is  thus-far left unsaid: &quot;Soon Forget&quot; is a quaint departure from  the Pearl Jam norm, but not particularly essential to the album.   &quot;Rival&quot; and &quot;Evacuation&quot; come across as the album's  weak points, but perhaps are acquired tastes.  I'd suspect that &quot;of  the girl,&quot; &quot;sleight of hand,&quot; and maybe even  &quot;breakerfall&quot; all could be songs that will grow on me.  I haven't  read the lyrics yet, but I am confident that this aspect of the music would  not detract from the whole given the bands prior record.  If Pearl Jam were  ever to read this, I love you guys!  Another fine performance!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Everyone seems to try and make excuses for Pearl Jam. To say &quot;don't expect Ten, but this album is great.&quot; howver if we look at Ten, the anthems like &quot;alive&quot; were truly mellow ballads, just what PJ has  begun perfecting. Also, we all know that after we had had TEN for a long  time we ended up listening to &quot;Oceans&quot; and &quot;Release&quot;  almost exclusively. Now Pearl Jam gives us the taught funky ROCK songs,  along with better songs then Oceans and Release but in the same vein and  what do we do? Make excuses?  PJ doesn't need them, Ten was good,  but this album is BETTER. the muscianship has been drawn out from behind  distortion to song writing...this is one of the only bands that can blend  political songs such as &quot;greivance&quot; and touching love songs  &quot;thin air&quot; onto the same album. As soon as i heard this album i  was blown away.  No other band sounds like PJ, that is a hell of a  compliment when you can distance yourself that much.  &quot;Light  Years&quot; is one of the best PJ songs ever hands down, in fact, there  isn't a song on here that wouldn' be considered a great song. From the  driving old school rock of &quot;Breakerfall&quot; to the beautiful almost  surreal &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; this is not TEN. and guess what? It is  better that way. What would we do with another TEN? Pearl Jam decided  around the time of Vitalogy to not release the same album again, and they  have given us everything we ever could have wanted. Who would make an  excuse for that?
B00004T8RK|4.0|If NO CODE were ever to mate with VITOLOGY, I would envision this album resulting from the union.  Distant cousins  to some of the songs might be &quot;Glorified G&quot; and &quot;Do the Evolution,&quot; as &quot;Light  Years,&quot; comes across as a muffled, much lighter and more heart-felt  rendition of the former.  As for &quot;Do the Evolution,&quot; the album's  first three songs are all reminiscent but not match up to the standard of  the aforementioned rowdy masterpiece.  Pearl Jam has strayed far from the  grunge anthems of TEN, and it would seem doubtful that they will ever  return.  Instead, they have presented another edgy experiment, which shines  on such numbers as &quot;light years,&quot; &quot;thin air,&quot;  &quot;insignicance,&quot; &quot;grievance,&quot; and their opening single,  &quot;nothing as it seems,&quot; which all the critics have labeled  'haunting.'  Special mentions might be made for &quot;god's dice,&quot; and  &quot;parting ways&quot; as well.  The album flows better than their  previous efforts, as it predominantly utilizes the fade-out method to  introduce the next song that punches with a raucus drum beat, gentle chord,  or other opening technique.  The way &quot;god's dice&quot; jumps out of  the close of &quot;breakerfall&quot; makes it seem like an extension of the  same song, and is an intrigueing pace-setter that adds character early in  the album by somehow blending the distinctively different qualities of the  two songs.  Another notable entance would be the growling that kicks off  &quot;rival,&quot; which is successfully blended with the initial drum  beat. There are none of the trippy tack-fillers that plagued VITOLOGY and  appeared as a red dot on YIELD, and we can be grateful to Pearl Jam that  they chose actual songs for all of the tracks on the album.  All that is  thus-far left unsaid: &quot;Soon Forget&quot; is a quaint departure from  the Pearl Jam norm, but not particularly essential to the album.   &quot;Rival&quot; and &quot;Evacuation&quot; come across as the album's  weak points, but perhaps are acquired tastes.  I'd suspect that &quot;of  the girl,&quot; &quot;sleight of hand,&quot; and maybe even  &quot;breakerfall&quot; all could be songs that will grow on me.  I haven't  read the lyrics yet, but I am confident that this aspect of the music would  not detract from the whole given the bands prior record.  If Pearl Jam were  ever to read this, I love you guys!  Another fine performance!

6305076626|5.0|This film is more fun than finding out the IRS owes YOU!  Well, almost.  Tim Curry's every movement, facial expression and raised eyebrow is perfect.  He took his depiction of Frank'n'Furter all the way to Alpha  Centauri.  Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon were wonderful as the naive  lovers.  Richard O'Brien made the most delightful Handy-man, a cross  between the oh-so-correct English butler and Boris Karloff with a bit of  Roger Daltry tossed in.  But the star of the film, beyond a doubt, is the  music.  It's bursting with joy, melodic, lyrical.  You just can't help but  grin and sing along.  Try it; you'll like it!
0451450523|5.0|&quot;The unicorn lived in a lilac wood and she lived all alone ...&quot;  So starts this enchanting tale, a line like poetry.  The book and the film have sort of the same feel about it; only in the book, the mood is broken  sometimes with a quirky jar of humour - like, did you know that the  romantic Byronic figure of Prince Lear in the beautifully illustrated film  used to be fat?  Yes, I didn't really want to know that, or that he lost  weight slaying dragons!<br />Great imaginative ensemble of characters - people  who role-play might recognise a touch of it in that aspect.  The characters  though are possibly embodiments of philosophical points of view.  Some  speculation on my part:  Is the butterfly a satire of the educated man?   &quot;Butterflies only know songs and poetry and anything else they hear  ...&quot;  He knows much, but cannot answer the Unicorn's question.  And  what of Schmenderick, the misfit magician?  His unspoken wish which the  unicorn cannot fulfil &quot;I cannot make you a true magician&quot; reminds  us that there is no unicorn or magic strong enough to make us into what we  are not - only we can fulfil our own dreams. And who hasn't been side  tracked from a dream, eliciting the unicorn's scorn &quot;He is no magician  now, but the King's court clown.&quot;  Then there is the greedy witch's  &quot;Illusions, deceptions, mirages.  Your Mommy Fortuna cannot truly  change things.&quot;  And what of King Haggard who only gets happiness by  keeping happiness from the world.  What is Beagle thinking about our  society?  Or how about the burly robber baron with his band of merry men,  who declares, &quot;Robin Hood is a myth.  We are the reality.&quot;  This,  from a story book character!  And of course the big question is &quot;What  is the Red Bull?&quot; - everyone has a personal Red Bull, even a Unicorn.   And what of love and immortality; why &quot;I will not love you when I am a  unicorn.&quot;  <br />It seems simplistic when it is written out like that,  but those themes and so many others are so intricately woven into the  story, to engage us in our own wonderings.  Like all best stories it is  part myth and fantastic narrative.
B000002BE9|5.0|OK, here is my only gripe about this CD. I can't sing along with it. Apple does so many amazing things with her voice that it would take some serious study to follow along with her. Do you remember the movie Amadeus, when  Salieri composed a rather simple tune of welcome and Mozart came in and  played about five incredibly complex variations on it? That's what Fiona  Apple can do with a melody line--she's just astonishing. So much talent,  and she's so young...if she doesn't self destruct we are in for a rich  lifetime of her gifts. Thank you Fiona!
B00004SCX6|3.0|Cashing in quickly on this game of fast fame and obscurity, Britney puts out her 2nd CD in 1 1/2 years! The lead-off title-track pretty much repeats the generic hip-hop/funk/pop formula of Baby...One More Time but with more  sex appeal! Check out the hot video of the song! Songs like Stronger and  Lucky shows a slight maturity in direction but not very much more. She  co-wrote Dear Diary in this album. One surprise though is the remake of the  Rolling Stones classic I Cant Get No Satisfaction which Britney perfects in  her unique Britney-style. Overall, a listenable efort and give this 18  year-old some more time to do something else amazing again.
B00003CWLE|5.0|This is an absolutely beautiful film - a feast for the eyes.  Chow Yun-Fat is excellent and the story is lots of fun.  This and the Sixth Sense were my two favorite movies of 1999!
0783244320|5.0|This movie is my favorite comedy.  I will have to get my own copy! People who saw Star Trek would like it but people that just like comedies would like it.  This is the &quot;Movie of the Year&quot; for me!
B00003CWL5|1.0|The movies that Hollywood made in 1999,  with few exceptions, consistently debased life issues and traditional family values.  American Beauty is no exception.  The movie takes the traditional family unit (you know, two  parents - one male, one female, with children) and makes a complete mockery  of it.  In addition, the role played by the ex-Marine neighbor portrays  military personnel (to whom this country owes way too much gratitude) to be  psycho fruitcakes.   I hated this movie.  I work too hard at making a good  stable home-life for my husband and children to accept that the message in  this movie is anything but destructive.  Kevin Spacey is  extremely  talented and has wasted his efforts here.  If you want to see him in a good  role, get &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.
B000001A6X|5.0|Songs in The Key of Life may be considered Stevie Wonder's epic,but this overblown collection has more fat than meat,especially the second half.Fortunately its been remastered and reissued with newly improved liner  notes and sound.The first CD pressing sounds as if its been mastered from a  4th generation master.Now the sound is cleaner as well as clearer.Its a  whole new listening experience that even the dull songs(Joy Inside My  Tears,Black Man)are worth a second listen.Although the classics(I Wish,Sir  Duke,As,Isn't She Lovely)appear on At The Close Of The Century,its nice to  hear them in their original album context(especially the underrated gem  Summer Soft).Granted this would've made a better single album,but the  digital makeover makes it sounds like  the first time you've heard it back  in '76.
0800184327|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie over and over again.  The actors, the dancing, the music.  Excellent.  It has a lot of realness in it.  The storyline is a little shaky in the beginning.  Rafael can't just come to Houston, TX from  Cuba.  It is a lot harder than that.  But, after that, the movie has me  wrapped up.  When I can't sleep, I get up and watch it.  The actors are  wonderful and the dancing is beyond words.  I love to watch people dance  that are so fantastic at it.  I am so envious.  Summing up,  I loved the  movie completely.  And, I do have a life.
B000003S2K|5.0|Commercial flying has certainly changed since &quot;Music for Airports&quot; was conceived, but Eno helps us remember when flying was physical metaphor, and existential thrill.   The most pleasant experience  in recent domestic U.S. air travel has been that concourse under the United  Airlines terminals at O'Hare, all polished alloy, indirect colored light,  and Eno.  To be there, is to be inside the music, a place to be cherished.   I still play this CD more than any other.  It needs a system with good  bass; let that first suboceanic chord establish the foundation, feel the  structure soar above it and know why flying, and a lot of other things,  used to be a lot more fun.
B000020617|5.0|After the Colour &amp; Shape, which is a masterpeice itself I didn't think the Foo's could get any better, but they go and make an even better album!  Every song from start to finish is perfection.  I hope to see more of this  from the Foo Fighters in the future, great work!
0156907399|5.0|Woolf's sentence structure is entrancing, and her descriptions of the thoughts of the characters are vivid.  I was intrigued at what goes on inside of Woolf's head because of profundities such as \\"the very stone one  kicks with one's boot will outlast Shakespeare,\\" and \\"so much depends ...  upon distance: whether people are near or far from us.\\"<br />It is nice that a  book this intense can be a quick read.  Anyone can read it and feel that  they have accomplished something, not just the erudite.  However, to really  appreciate To the Lighthouse, you will have to read it a few  times.<br />Woolf's writing style will be hard for many.  She forms many  complex sentences.  The book is mostly about the internal struggles of her  characters rather than a physical action book.  Still, this is a very  poignant book, and her prose is artistry with a purpose.<br />Skip the forward  by Eudora Welty if you don't want a summary of the action of the book.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Wow!  When I first got this album, I was in shock, what is with the new sound.  Then, slowly it started to grow on me.  No Code is an absolute masterpeice from start to finish.  I'm not even going to mention the best  songs, just read the album list, they are all perfect.  What else can I  say?  Perfection!
B00004T0US|3.0|In an amazing warping of truth in advertising, RCA has remastered and reissued the entire _From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee_ album, preceeded it with nine of the original ten cuts from _Moody Blue_,  and dubbed the result _Moody Blue_ with &quot;ten tracks orignally released  on &quot;From Elvis Presley Boulevard....&quot;.&quot;  They've even  changed the cover art!  Wouldn't it have been more effective to just delete  the three forgettable live tracks from _Moody Blue_, added some alternate  takes, and call it the _Complete Graceland Sessions_?<br />Of course, apart  from _Elvis Country_, Elvis and RCA were never known for their sense of  careful album planning.  Enough bitterness...<br />These performances capture  Elvis at a misunderstood period in his life.  Yes, he was overweight,  unhealthy, and bored with the superstar life.  That did not, however, stop  him from laying down consistently strong performances.  &quot;Way  Down&quot; is probably Elvis' most convincing rocker since &quot;Burning  Love&quot; while &quot;She Thinks I Still Care&quot; and &quot;He'll Have  to Go&quot; are two of his best country tunes since his final Nashville  sessions in 1971.<br />Other highlights of this package include the King's  haunting rendition of &quot;Danny Boy&quot;, the great &quot;Love Coming  Down&quot;, &quot;For the Heart&quot;, and  &quot;Solitaire&quot;.<br />Unfortunately, a handful of true stinkers weigh  this collection down.  The three remaining live tracks from _Moody Blue_  (&quot;Let Me Be There&quot; was left off even though there was still  plenty of room on the CD for it.  Plus, it was already available on a  previous live album) are generally forgettable.  &quot;Unchained  Melody&quot; is okay, but reminds the listener of the shakiness of Elvis'  final live performances.  &quot;If You Love Me&quot; is barely decent but  &quot;Little Darlin'&quot; may well be the worst song Elvis dared to  release during the 70's.<br />Finally, there'sthe schmaltzy &quot;The Last  Farewell&quot;.  If &quot;Way Down&quot; and &quot;Burning Love&quot; were  reminders that the 70's Elvis could still rock with the best of them, the  hideously overproduced (even by Elvis standards) &quot;The Last  Farewell&quot; strongly supports the widely-held belief that Elvis was a  washed-up, overweight Vegas crooner by 1976.<br />Overall, though, this is a  very listenable compilation which would probably get three and a half stars  it that were an option.  A half star, however, was docked because of the  screwed-up billing of this collection.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Pearl Jam is the greatest band on earth!  Yet, this album after 5 listenings just doesn't seem to hold it's own against Yeild and No Code, which I consider their best two albums.  The drumming sounds really muted  and the vocal mix is just weird, I bet these songs will be great live, but  it sounds awkward on the album.  Highlights are God's Dice, Insignificance,  Light Years, and Soon Forgot, with all the other songs definitely worth  listening too.  Considering that this is Pearl Jam, I expected more (I  think the prodcuer screwed up personally).  While this is no Yeild, it is  still worthy of owning and makes a fine addition to any collection, I give  it 3 stars out of 5.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney is back and better than ever! I'm a teenager, I admit it, but this girl is soo amazing. All the rumers about her.Which she does not deserve, only made her stronger. She has personality and voice. This album is really amazing! The album is good from top to bottem. &quot;Opps, I Did It  Again,&quot; is pure fun, but it's only one good song. &quot;Don't Let Me  Be The Last To Know,&quot; is my favorite. I think it will be really BIG!  &quot;Stronger,&quot; reminds me of ABBA, &quot;Lucky,&quot; another great  song is even a little sad, and  is a bit 50's style. &quot;I Can't Get No  Satisfaction,&quot; is possibly the best remake ever.&quot;When Your Eyes  Say It,&quot; is another great song, which you could'nt tell was written by  Diane Warren. I'm telling you she'll be around for a long time.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Not quite what I expected after the brilliant Yeild.  Many of the songs sound awkwardly produced, drums muted and vocals which just don't sound as great as in the past.  Don't get me wrong though, many of the songs such as  God's Dice, Light Years, Insignificance, and Soon Forgot, are simply  irresistable (pun intended, bad joke).  I cannot wait to hear these songs  live though, this sounds like the perfect live material.  Yet the album  does not live up to the past wonderous albums Yeild and No Code, so I give  it 3 out of 5 stars.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I have already listened to this album 4 times in the past 2 days and I think it is incredible.  I think the last three releases, No Code (brilliant - go back and listen to it!), Yield and Binaural have been their  best - yes even better than Ten.  I have been a fan for 8 years now and it  is refreshing to hear more of Stone &amp; Jeff's writing.  There are some  interesting sounds on here like Eddie on the ukelele in &quot;Soon  Forget&quot; and a viola and cello ending the album with &quot;Parting  Ways&quot;.  &quot;Light Years&quot; is probably my favorite song on here -  the melody just sticks in your head.  &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot; is so  haunting - I especially love the bass drum in it.  I am really anxious to  hear these songs live - I think they'll be amazing.  Thanks Pearl Jam for  being my constant companion over the years and continuing to make such  great meaningful music.
B000002VEP|5.0|Okay, no such word, but sometimes it's hard to think of a catchy title!  &quot;Gaudi&quot; is an interesting Alan Parsons collection.  It wasn't as successful as some of his earlier releases, and it didn't really produce a  hit single.  Only &quot;Standing on Higher Ground&quot; received any type  of airplay, and it's not one of his best tunes, although certainly beats  most of what plagues our airwaves these days!  (Am I sounding like my  parents?).  The lengthy &quot;La Sagrada Familia&quot; is typical Alan  Parsons extravagance, but is beautiful and quite good.  Lead vocalist John  Miles does a great job with the vocals, and the tongue-twisting title is  actually a very lyrical phrase.  As always, Mr. Parsons' arrangement (along  with Eric Woolfson) is impeccable.  My favorite song is &quot;Too  Late.&quot;  Lenny Zakatek (who also sang an early hit, &quot;Damned If I  Do&quot;) does this great &quot;pop&quot; sounding tune.  It reminds me of  early Paul Carrack and Ace, but it has a sound all its own.  It has a great  hook, too.  Don't know why Arista didn't push this as a single.  It would  have done fairly well, I think.  &quot;Closer to Heaven&quot; is a  signature mushy Parsons ballad, but it lacks the beauty of &quot;Old and  Wise&quot; and &quot;Time.&quot;  John Miles returns for a sarcastic take  on &quot;Money Talks.&quot;  Overall, a good Parsons collection and worth  the investment.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I have only one word to say: Awesome! This CD is jam packed with great songs that reveal the spirit of Britney. All the songs are spectacular and lives up to the expectation of Britney. This is a must-CD for all music  lovers and is just as good as Britney's first CD. You will not skip any  song in this CD..trust me..you will listen to this CD over and over. She is  just amazing! Love her!
B000002LK1|2.0|Surprisingly, since I am such a big fan of Electro-Industrial and various kinds of 80s wave, I really don't find this album to have much worth listening to. At least for me, DM has a horrible sense of chords and notes  to create an emotional response, as all they do is make me bored.
B00000JCB2|2.0|All of the songs on this album are average at best.  It seems everything on the album has been turned into a bunch of B.S. now that Fred is MTV's new poster child.  If you are a hardcore Limp Bizkit fan (then something is  wrong with you) this CD might peak your interest, otherwise get something  from a real band like Slipknot (band that Fred thought got big cuz of him.  What an ego.)or Disturbed.
B000002G7G|4.0|Well.....let's put things this way....<br />Velvet underground first two records are considered rosetas stones of the modern pop and rock music. The banana album and White light/White heat were chaotic in their  essence...sometimes brutal....innovative.....the fact is that Velvet  Underground is the first absolut modern rock band......        They crossed  the red line in the first 2 albuns.....something dangerous,  painfull,revoltutionary to do......They could never get out of it without  scars..stigmas.......After going to hell...they found out that maybe  there's a light somewhere.       THAT'S WHAT THE 3RD ALBUM IS ALL ABOUT!     Faith....on something better.<br />    When something like this  happens....someone ( a person, a band, whatever..) finding a reason to  smile right after the darkness..it's beautiful...like a child under the  sun.<br />Thank you.
6305076464|5.0|Fawlty Towers is and always will be my favourite television comedy series of all time.  The writing is genius; John Cleese in all his gangly madness is as usual, brilliant, and the supporting characters, Polly (comic  genius), Manuel (&quot;Manuel, you're a waste of space!&quot;), Basil's  wife, the residents of the B&amp;B, all worth their salt.  There are  episodes that have literally caused me to fold in half with laughter. The  visiting Germans, the Health Inspector and Basil the escaped rat, the  construction project, the anniversary, and the waldorf salad (a wonderful  example of the British perspective of Americans)... all attaining the  highest excellence in televised entertainment.  I give it my highest  recommendation!
0792844890|5.0|Mel Brooks is the master...&quot;We're not worthy!  We're not worthy!&quot;  This whole movie is a tongue in cheek jab at the genre of sci fi movies:  Star Wars, Star Trek, Planet of the Apes.  I about fell off  the couch rolling with laughter...every time I watch it.  Rick Moranis as  Dark Helmet has to be one of best casting decisions of all time (&quot;I  hate it when my schwartz gets twisted!&quot;).  If you like spoofs and  cheap shots and bad jokes (bad as in &quot;*groan*...I can't believe they  actually went there...hahahahahaha!&quot;) and falling of the couch in fits  of laughter, this movie is definitely for you!
B000001FKY|5.0|I can't believe you actually have to read this review to know whether or not to get this album. YES! This one is worth the money because every song is incredible, and the album flows. My favorites are 'Animal', 'Hysteria', 'Pour Some Sugar on Me' and 'Love Bites'. But can you believe I left out 'Women' and 'Rocket'? Def Leppard was IT when this album came out, and when you hear it now, you can see why. I'm not even that much of a rock fan, (I am more of a pop/R&B fan), but I can appreciate good music when I hear it. This CD will never leave my CD changer for very long, and it won't leave yours either. Believe the critics, not only is this the best Def Leppard CD ever, but it is one of the best of 80s Rock. Awesome! I'm surprised there hasn't been a remake of 'Love Bites' because it is one of the best ballads I have ever heard. I think Lenny Kravitz could pull it off...
0767811070|5.0|This has got be be one of the great dramas of the 90s.  John Singleton's storytelling is outstanding.  He makes us care for the characters.  Probably Gooding's best performance ever.  This is also the movie that made  Lawrence Fishburne one of my favorite actors.  The casting of Ice Cube as  the adult Doughboy was genius.  He played the part perfectly.<br />In this  movie, Singleton gives us a graphic portrayal of life in the inner city.   Ricky's struggles to grow up and be a man as his father defines one is  almost painful to watch, especially when he loses his best friend to  senseless violence.  This is not a glamourization of gang life, but rather  a vivid portrayal of the fight for survival.  This is a graphic,  depressing, honest movie and one that I am happy to see made.  This is  definitely a movie that every drama lover should see.
B000002AVF|3.0|This Cd is a pushover. She's probably being pushed over by her better works like Butterfly and Music Box, but that's beside the point. Despite the fact that Daydream spawned Mariah's greatest singles--One Sweet Day,  Fantasy and Always Be My Baby, the rest of the album can't live up. The  songs are incredibly soft for some reason and aren't that great. Underneath  The Stars is alright, but is very cliched. I think it is still worth  getting, but not as much so as some of her other works.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Creative, forceful, exciting and then tender and heart-wrenching.  Tom Waits is one of the few truly original musical artists of our time.  He is a natural treasure.  Give the record a couple of listens to let it grow,  but then BAM-MO!  the hook is set.  To accept this challenge you must be  open-minded and ready for adventure.  I am addicted to this record.<br />I  really can't compare this with any of his other records, but there are a  good handful of brilliant ones with his name on the cover (Rain Dogs is one  of the best records ever, by anyone).
B0000028P8|4.0|I said Mariah Carey had the voice, and this proves it. She showcases it on her greatest songs of that time. Mariah Carey really is a superstar. The only reason that it gets 4 stars is because where is the new material?   I'll Be There is a cover, and other than that, why should anyone buy this  as aposed to her Emotions and self-titled CD?
B000002GYR|5.0|I have an old vinyl copy of this record.  Whenever I want to feel the power of raw emotion and heartfelt melodies, reminise about the power of love and the way that heart-break can give you a huge warm lump in your  gut, I put on a fire, open a bottle of wine, and put on the scratchy old  record.<br />I have many, many hundreds of records, which span the years and  musical styles.  I have only one favorite (by a long distance).  <br />Well I  hope that I don't fall in love with you...
B0000028VT|5.0|I Love this CD!  Mariah Carey is at her best here!  This is my favorite of her Cd's, followed by Butterfly. These songs are amazing! I love Hero, Dreamlover, Never Forget You, Anytime You Need A Friend, Now That You  Know...all of it!  Her voice is great, the lyrics are great, the beats are  great!  This is a must have CD!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I went to this movie only because my G.F wanted to see Brad pitt, and although I knew I liked his acting I was completely blown away by both the script, the acting and the directing.   For the ones out there who don't  know that much about a movie let me say this. It's the kind of movie that  really makes you think and better yet, it's a movie that you can watch over  and over again. I'd also like to point out that Ed Norton was amazing!
B000002BQK|5.0|This CD is great. While it shows a new side to Mariah's Music, it isn't ompletely hip hop dance stuff like Rainbow. It has an excellent mix. Butterfly and My All are incredible songs, and Honey is an awesome dance  tune. Breakdown and Whenever You Call are cool too, along with The Roof,  4th of July and Babydoll. I could listen to this forever!
B00003CWOL|5.0|As most movies are when filled with high profile stars, I thought it would be a sweet, plotless bomb.   I couldn't stop laughing! The whole cast was amazing, the script briliant. It was great seeing George Carlin again.   If  you are looking for a funny movie and are not too uptight. See this movie!
B00000J7RZ|1.0|This CD is so bad that I was tempted to throw it away, despite the 15 bucks I had just spent on it. It is a horrible CD and there is nothing else to say. Besides she's hot and IF YOU HAD MY LOVE is good. but other than  that the CD is horrible.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple may not have the best reputation in the world, but, she certainly is one of the most talented artists out there.  Each song on this album is delicious, and once you take a bite out of it, you won't be able  to stop.  This album has a sound that you won't hear anywhere else, and  Apple's voice works perfectly with each song.  The first track &quot;On the  Bound&quot; is extremely addictive and really gets you into the mood that  this album creates.  If you're hesitating as to whether you should buy this  CD or not, you should definitely buy it!  You won't regret it!
B00004T0P1|5.0|One of the best soundtracks in a while, Dinosaur continues the trend that Disney has been inserting better background music into their films.  Lion King had a great score, but not till Goldsmith's Mulan did the score out-do  the songs with words.  Dinosaur seems to go the next step by eliminating  the sterotype songs and boldly thriving on it's own.  It's not that I  dislike the stereotype songs, on the contrary I enjoy them, but it's great  to see Disney trying something new, and James Newton Howard doesn't  disappoint.  The best tracks are &quot;The Egg Travels,&quot;  &quot;Courtship,&quot; &quot;Crossing the Dessert,&quot; and &quot;Finding  Water.&quot;
B00004T8RK|5.0|I just went out and bought this CD tonight and WOW!  They've done it again.  It's amazing how they are able to keep topping album after album.  But they do.  Which is cool.  If you've been a fan for a LONG time, or just  heard thier song on the radio and thought they sounded like an awesome  band, you'll love this CD and you wont be disappointed.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural does not dissapoint. In my opinion this is Pearl Jam's best work since VS. The album starts out rocking then gets kind of a spacey feel to it. Then goes in between the two. Easy on the ears from start to finish.  Buy it today! You won't regret it. It's an album you won't &quot;soon  forget&quot;.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I actually was worried about the album when I first heard the single... however, after purchasing Binaural I was pleasantly surprised.  The album falls into the grey area between OK and Great.  Once again, PJ defied my  expectations, yet does not defy my need for good music.
0375703764|4.0|Let me first make a suggestion - before you read this book, or even this review, consider the normal state of entertainment in America.  Take your favorite  play, book, movie or TV show.   Consider how the plot or story line is developed.  While there might be a flashback to another time, or a  &quot;red herring&quot; to throw you off, the story almost always lays out  in a straight line - it's linear.   Mystery, solution - conflict, climax.    Wrap it up in 22 minutes and see you next week.  Please, go ahead, test  this theory with any book you choose.  Read it and when you're finished,  plot out the story line.  Then read House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski and  try the same thing.  That's what I've done in preparing this review, and  have discovered the following: 1) I can't finish.  I can read all the  pages, in any order I choose, over and over again, but I can not say I'm  done.  I may never be done 2) I can tell you some of the story lines, I  just don't know how many there are.    I've found at least four - three in  my first reading, and another in the second.  There seems to be a fifth and  sixth one trying to be unearthed if I look hard enough.  I stopped plotting  them out after creating two polygons, a circle and one somewhat straight  line, that connects a point on the circle to one of the polygons.  3) Don't  wait for the movie .  It would have to be 3 days long, and it could only be  viewed on  videotape by yourself  so you could rewind and review when you  had a question.<br />As you might have guessed, House of Leaves is not very  linear, and definitely not for everybody.  Mark Danielewski seems to have  done everything possible to stop you from reading.   700+ pages first  filled with type that suddenly goes upside down, sideways,  backwards ,  even down to one letter on a page.  Three different kinds of footnotes come  in three different typefaces, and they can't be skipped, because most of  the story is there, along with mountains of superfluousinformation.   Determining which is which is part of the fun.   This is a review, so I  supposed I  must try to answer the question What's it about?  Perhaps it's  the story of a paranormal experiences of  a house which is larger inside  than outside.  Or perhaps it's the story of the movie about that house.  Or  perhaps it's the story of the review of the movie about the house, written  over a 20 year period by a blind mystery man. Ostensibly, it's about the  young man who finds the  unfinished manuscript and extensive research notes  of the review of the movie about the house, the young man   who felt  compelled to finish it for the mystery man, who dies at the beginning of  the book.  Or perhaps it's the story of the young man himself as the  decision to finish the book throws his life into chaos.   (Okay, there are  the four story lines I found.  The fifth is about the young man's  relationship with his  mother and her mental condition, and the sixth has  something to do with mythology, I think)     <br />Ignore the  &quot;novel&quot; designation on the cover - this book is real.   Danielewski's genius is not in the story or the confusion of style, it's in  his expert ability to suck you into his world.   I was hooked instantly,  and have to fight to remember that it's not a true story.   Danielewski has  created something that is so original in style and story that comparisons  are almost impossible  ( I can only think of one  -  &quot;He writes like  David Lynch makes movies.&quot;  But that doesn't do either of them justice  and probably won't get me a blurb in the advertisements for the next  printing.)  Should you read it?  Only if you have lots of time and  patience, and the urge to discover something before everybody else.   But  if you do chose to read it, take the advice of a (very) minor character in  the book  who has read the book - at least three of them have.  As he hands  it over he warns  &quot;Be careful.  It will change your life.&quot;  It  has mine.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD is not really better then Briteny's first one but different i really like munber 2 and 7 they are heatt to heart and mean a lot for you people in love the songs really speak to you. This is such a good CD i can  not tell you enough you MUST buy it all you Briteny fans i am listening to  it right now.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|Overall, this DVD is great, but had a few major problems.  <br />First, I was expecting &quot;All&quot; of Whitney's videos to appear, but they didn't - False Advertising.  This DVD was missing major videos - &quot;I Believe In  You and Me&quot;, &quot;Exhale(Shoop, Shoop)&quot;, &quot;My Name is not  Susan&quot;, &quot;Count On Me&quot; and &quot;When You Believe&quot;.   They gipped me out of 5, count 'em 5 videos - What happen here?    They should have just waited and released the DVD when they had finished  all the videos for the new singles from the greatest hits package,   Including &quot;All&quot; her videos as the advertisements say! <br />And,  Second - Sure all of the extras were great to watch, but some could have  been longer, like the MTV All Access - they showed about 3 minutes of  that!   I wanted to see the whole thing in it's entirety like it was  originally shown on MTV!   Also, the Cinderella segment was not worth  watching, they showed only a minute of that, she didn't even sing the whole  song, very disappointing!   All other special features were alright but  could have been done better, some were too long, others were too  short! <br />All in all, if you're a die hard whitney fan and you have DVD,  you'll appreciate it and might even like it.  I do reccommend that you buy  this &quot;if you have DVD&quot;, You'll love &quot;most&quot; of those  classic videos, that we've all grown to appreciate, since &quot;all&quot;  aren't available.  And who knows, maybe they'll put out a supplement DVD  with all the videos they didn't include on this one.  However, I doubt they  would be kind enough to do that.
B0000009SF|5.0|This is an extremely good CD made by better than average professionals. I mean professional musicians, DG. Anyway Frank was just being Frank when he  frankly stated that if you see a fish sticker on a car then you know that  is 'the enemy'.  That seems to be as foolish as saying that all _____ are  the enemy. In other words, mindless bigotry. I met his friend Don in Palo  Alto in 1977. It was a great opportunity to shake hands with Van Vliet and  I learned some things about Frank that reflected Don's concern for his  wayward friend. To everyone else, buy this CD from Amazon TODAY!
B00001U0GQ|5.0|Frankly, I cannot think of anything that could possilby improve this movie.  The acting by Daniel Day-Lewis is sincere and moving and brings the character of Hawkeye to life. Wes Studi as Magua is truly outstanding.  How  he did not garner best supporting actor is beyond me. He is a study in  hatred and revenge and his scenes are riveting. Kudos also for Madeline  Stowe and the French General whose name escapes me. Chingachgook, played by  Russel Means is flawless. The story is timeles and  the setting which is  supposed to be upstate New York is actually North Carolina is stunning and  beautifully filmed. What I found most outstanding is in the scenes where  the action is building or in full fledged engagement the music hauntingly  entraps you and surrounds the scene with absolute rapture. Last of the  Mohicans is a first class adventure and will, to my mind, be a timeless  masterpiece.
0812550706|5.0|If anyone thinks that this is not the best Sci-Fi book every written, they are not human. This book has everything, action, adventure, and mystery, all compacted into one book.
B0000033OZ|5.0|This first album by ELP is a very consistant listening experience. From &quot;Knife's Edge&quot; to &quot;Lucky Man,&quot; ELP keeps things tight. It would be the last time they would do this for a full album. Many purists  believe that the more they stretch it out, the better they are. It all  depends how long you can listen to Keith Emerson make noises with the  keyboard. I can't for very long, that is why this release is my favorite.
B000002J1M|5.0|There is no doubt that Foxtrot is a masterpiece, that should be owned by everyone who like early Genesis - let this be said. But - this is not meaning, that it couldn't have been better.<br />At my opinion, the  album-version of &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; is very disappointing, compared  to the 'Seconds Out'-version (which is absolutely amazing). I find Peter's  vocals quite disappointing compared to Phil's, but the song is still  fantastic.<br />The most succesful track is &quot;Watcher Of The Skies&quot;,  where all instruments and Peter's voice are perfect together. The lyrics  are super, and the music is great. &quot;Get 'Em Out By Friday&quot; is  great too - Peter has a funny ability to make a lot of different  'characters' with his voice, and the lyrics are quite funny.<br />&quot;Time  Table&quot; is very good and beautiful, and the instrumental  &quot;Horizons&quot; sounds rather like a piece of Enya - very beautiful.  &quot;Can Utility...&quot; is also great, but the ending is a little  irritating. Still, Foxtrot is a true masterpiece, and had &quot;Supper's  Ready&quot; been better (it is nearly half of the album, after all), it  would have been absolutely out-standing.
B000002J1I|2.0|This is one of the weaker albums that Yes has released. It has grown on me some, considering I thought it was absolute garbage when I first heard it. &quot;Don't Kill The Whale,&quot; &quot;Does It Ever Happen,&quot; and  &quot;Arriving UFO&quot; are not bad songs. It's just that the band sounds  like they are going thru the motions. It was also one of the last albums  that Jon Anderson was on. Not as bad as &quot;Tales From Topographic  Oceans&quot; but not even close to &quot;Fragile&quot; or &quot;Close To  The Edge.&quot;
B000002J1L|5.0|Nursery Cryme is short (39 min.) but it keeps an incredible high quality from first to last, making it a fantastic masterpiece.<br />&quot;The Musical Box&quot; is the best track, and what a song! The vocal parts are great,  even though Peter's voice is a little week in the closing section; but the  real power is in the music. The Guitar solos are super - it goes from  silent to wild, to silent and to wild - once you've got into this song,  it's so amazing. The closing section is clasical, but all the song is  fantastic.<br />&quot;For Absent Friends&quot; is very (too) short, but Phil  does some really lovely vocals, and even though it's very short and silent,  the some has a lot of inner power. &quot;Return Of Giant Hogweed&quot; is  really funny (the lyrics are quite absurd, about the Hogweeds killing the  human race! ), and the music is great - again, the guitar playing is  super.<br />&quot;Seven Stones&quot; is also very beautiful - not really a  ballad, but a somewhat slowgoing song, with a really great melody and great  lyrics. On the other hand, &quot;Harrold the Barrel&quot; is very uptempo,  and again, it has great and funny (and absurd) lyrics - it's quite  impressing how much the can sing in only 3 minutes! &quot;Harlequin&quot;  has a very strange sound - Phil and Peter makes some very special lyrics,  that sounds great.<br />&quot;The Fountain Of Salmacis&quot; is another very  powerful masterpiece - the lyrics are taken right out of Ovid's  'Metamorphoses', of the &quot;making&quot; of Hermaphroditos. Besides great  lyrics, it has some fantastic music, and again great guitarplaying.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is the strongest album Bowie has released. The scope of the character Ziggy Stardust is explored as Bowie transforms into the character. &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; is my favorite song on the album.  &quot;Starman&quot; &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; and &quot;Rock And Roll  Suicide&quot; are right behind it. No other Bowie album, track for track,  can match this one.
B00004STPT|4.0|This is an epic score that perfectly fit the movie. In fact, I think it adds immensely to the movie, especially in the sweeping battle sequence and in establishing mood in later scenes. The score balances extremely powerful  orchestral pieces by Zimmer with Lisa Gerrard's quieter and deeply  affecting passages. With respect to orchestral film music, Zimmer reminds   me of John Williams, Elmer Bernstein, and James Horner at their best. <br />I  suggest that one should not be bothered by Zimmer's borrowing from Holst  and Wagner -- Williams is notoriously guilty of it as well, although in a  sneakier way (he hides his thematic borrowing while Zimmer makes no attempt  to cover his tracks.) I have come to view this technique in film music more  as an homage to great classical music from the past. In fact many great  composers from the past borrowed thematic elements from each other. <br />In  the end one should judge a musical score not as an original music  composition, rather for its ability to establish the mood and enhance the  dramatic tension of what is happening on screen. In this regard, this music  is supremely successful. Trust me that this movie would be much weaker  without this musical score. This is one of the finer musical scores to come  along in years.
B000002J20|1.0|This album is very boring. The vinyl had one song on each side (four in all). By the time you got thru the first album, you couldn't bear the thought of listening to the second disc. This album continues to collect  dust in my collection.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Fasten your seat belts, you're in for a ride on this one.  This is one of their best albums since the sorely overlooked &quot;Vs&quot;.  The sound is raw, powerful, but well performed.  There are moments when you wish Eddide  Vedder would ennunciate better, but it does blend in well with the songs.   &quot;Breakerfall&quot; is a knockout song, and &quot;Thin Air&quot; is one  of the best songs I think they've done in years.  This is one intense  album.
B000002J1Y|5.0|This album is my favorite Yes album. &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; was very good on the &quot;The Yes Album,&quot; but it simply blew me away on this set. Every song is done just the way you would want it and the band never  sounded better.
0783223161|5.0|In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock decided to produce an inexpensive, black-and-white horror thriller based on a pulp fiction novel by Robert Bloch. With this inauspicious beginning, he created one of the landmarks of  cinema: &quot;Psycho.&quot;<br />Today, 40 years later, this film's stark  depiction of madness still gives chills, still is a marvel of direction,  acting, cinematography, and story. Hitchcock takes nearly an hour to allow  the audience to come to know Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). How utterly  astounded and horrified audiences were when he killed off this thoughtful,  complex, fallible woman in what would become the most notorious murder  scene ever. Hitch's mastery of audience manipulation is in full effect  here. Although some critics have slammed its psycho-babble climax, it  serves its purpose as the key to Norman Bates' mind. And look carefully, oh  so very carefully, at the very last close-up of Norman Bates' face--I won't  tell you what's there, but you have to see it. That Hitch, what a sense of  humor!<br />All of Hitchcock's themes are here: the icy blonde, the impotent  voyeur, the obsession with crime and innocence, secrets and guilt, and  humor blacker than he'd shown before. &quot;A son is a poor substitute for  a lover,&quot; Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) tells Marion, and for those  who knew Norman's secret, a repulsive shudder creeps through us even as we  chuckle.<br />This is one of my very favorite Hitchcock films. I love its  madness, its stylized violence, the shrieking, brilliant score by Bernard  Herrmann. This is a perfect movie for viewing at 1 a. m. with a dear loved  one. &quot;Oh, Mother, the blood! The blood!&quot;<br />Oh yes, the blood  indeed....
B000002UWF|5.0|If you're ever down or feeling blue, pop this CD in and take a different look at life.  Louis Prima laughed at everything and lived to make others laugh and swing.  Friends of mine that are heavy metal and Marylin Manson  fans love this CD.  It swings, it jumps, it's campy, it's folksy and will  probably put you in the best mood of your life.  I can't believe you get 26  songs for under $10.  If you never buy another &quot;swing&quot; album (  which this really isn't) buy this one.  The liner notes are also rather  informative about Louis life and untimely death.  He was swinging and  joking 'till the end. That's how I want to go out...and you should too.
B00004STJD|5.0|Certainly one of the best French comedies ever brought onto the big screen. The cast is perfect and the situations are hillarious from begining to end. I've seen the movie already 7 times at least and each time it's the  same pleasure ! An absolute must...
6305095442|5.0|I have been a big fan of this movie ever since I got a big poster of the movie in the mail featuring the huge menacing skull.  Evidently I was receiving free posters and &quot;not for resale&quot; copies of movies  because somebody thought I was a movie rental outlet or something.  After I  put the poster up on my wall to my parents dismay, I rented the movie.  After the first viewing, I wasn't sure what to make of it except that it  was very different and new.  This movie grows on you like a tumor.  I've  watched it so many times in the last 10 years, and the more I watch it, the  funnier it gets.  Many a night, my friends and I have drank, watched this  film, and laughed so hard that tears would be evident.  This is one of my  favorites.  I think everyone I shared it with has also loved it.  Horror?   Comedy?  Evil Dead2.  It's in a class of its' own.
6302787556|3.0|When I watched Spike Lee's &quot;Malcolm X&quot; on TV, it was a pleasurable surprise. Despite the film's three-hour-plus length, it was never boring and it managed to keep me interested until the last five  minutes or so.<br />It tells the story of Malcolm X and shows the enormous  changes he went through in his remarkable life. Though the film often fails  to take a really intimate look at Malcolm X, Denzel Washington's  superlative performance successfully counters this weakness. He keeps us  interested in this man, despite the fact, that Lee's film, though it is  exquisitely filmed, lacks the courage to explorethe person Malcolm X. The  film rather deals with the historical figure of Malcolm and the key events  of his life. This makes his picture sometimes seem more dutiful than  dramatic. Still, &quot;Malcolm X&quot; is one of the best biopics, not only  because of Denzel Washington and the other very good actors. I also liked  the cinematography by Ernest Dickerson, the music and the production design  which added to the authentic mood of the movie.<br />If Lee had ended his  movie five minutes earlier, I would have given it four stars, but  unfortunately, he made the disastrous decision to add a closing coda that  one can only call embarrasing. It's nothing else but clumsy propaganda and  nowhere near the subtlety that the rest of the film displayed. It even  features Nelson Mandela who seems to feel uncomfortable in front of a film  camera. Maybe Lee was afraid of the subtlety of his picture and feared that  someone couldn't get the message. I know that this is just speculation.  Whatever his motives were, he didn't do his film a favour.
B000003S0F|4.0|This Crimso line-up gets dissed a lot, and yes Boz Burrell was a beginner bassist(taught by Fripp because they couldn't find someone who would stick around)and Ian Wallace lacks the grace of a Giles or Bruford (or Andy  McCulloch even). Even so there are great moments here(as well as on the  live material from this era which I collect more than any other  period).There is the light &quot;Formentara Lady&quot;, the blistering  instrumental &quot;Sailor's Tale&quot;, the rocking, even bluesey (for  Crimson) &quot;Ladies Of The Road&quot;. Mel Collins blows a mean sax  throughout this release.
0553577123|5.0|More than just a historical document, Anne Frank's diary stands not only as a tribute to her but as a tribute to all those who lost their lives so wantonly and unnecessarily during World War Two.  I wept while reading it,  for her teenage hopes, dreams, and frustrations mirrored my own, and I wept  because her dreams for the future never came to fruitition.  One of Anne's  wishes was that she should continue living after her death, and thanks to  this diary, her memory will never fade, and her spirit will live on in the  hearts of those that cherish this book for centuries to come.
B00002E233|1.0|The director's commentary on the DVD goes great leaps toward explaining what was intended in this movie. I do not feel that the characters were well developed. I did not feel sorry for them when attacked by the shark.  Some of the deleted scens would have helped to understand the relationships  between characters. The Computer Graphics were OK, but nothing stunning  compared to movies of late. Basically, I feel that they should have tried  harder. It could have been much more interesting.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This new cd is the best ever!  All of these songs are great.  My favorite on this cd is &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;.  For anybody that says she can't sing without back-up singers you should listen to that song.  My  least favorite song is the remix of (I can't get no) Statisfaction.
6303020089|5.0|One of the greatest thrillers of all time, The Fugitive is a textbook example of a thriller that keeps its audience glued without insulting their intelligence.  Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a Chicago surgeon, is  wrongly convicted of killing his wife (Sela Ward), escapes from prison and  heads back to his hometown in search of the real killer, a mysterious  one-armed man that Kimble struggled with in his house after his wife's  murder.  U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones, in his Oscar-winning  role) and his deputies relentlessly pursue Kimble in and around Chicago,  always staying a few steps behind.<br />This movie works on so many levels,  but it begins with the actors.  Harrison Ford, is one of his best roles,  perfectly portrays the dignity and righteous indignation that Kimble feels.   He should have received an Oscar nomination for the sheer physical and  emotional effort that he put into this character.  Jones is a perfect  choice for Gerard: He is relentless, shrewd and sarcastic in his quest to  track down Kimble.  He always projects a smarmy, superior quality that  attracts the viewer, yet makes us want him to lose his prey.  The terrific  supporting cast includes Joe Pantoliano, Andreas Katsulas, Daniel Roebuck,  and Jeroen Krabbe.<br />Director Andrew Davis takes the audience along for the  chase, and uses Chicago as his landscape, including a busy St. Patrick's  Day Parade for one scene. These locations enhance the film by using the  city as a maze through which this chase occurs.  Another terrific feature  is James Newton Howard's score, which manages to add color and tension to  scenes, even when there is no dialogue. Perfect all around, from acting,  directing, composing and screenplay, The Fugitive should remain a  classic.<br />Vote: 10
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is cd is brilliant.  Her best cd yet.  She is amazing and this cd shows.  Every single song on this album has #1 hit material!  I hope Britney gets the credit she deserves for this album (FINALLY).  Everyone go  buy this CD cause you won't regret it!
B00003CWL6|3.0|Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening both give great performances in this dark comedy-drama. The director, Sam Mendes, comes straight from Broadway, and you can tell. The movie feels like a play. It starts out with Spacey  narrating, giving us a tour of his town  la &quot;Our Town&quot;. The  direction has its good and bad points. The acting is terrific, but the  movie feels claustrophobic. Perhaps you are supposed to feel trapped on  that stage of suburbia, but that conflicts with some of the aerial  cinematography that would suggest otherwise. In any case, this is the story  of a failed marriage and a father who tries to become close with his  insecure daughter who ends up dating a creepy guy, so perhaps this might  not be your best choice for a family outing. However, this movie is favored  to win several Golden Globe awards, including Best Actor (Spacey) and Best  Picture. Three stars. Josh Bob says check this out...on video.
B000007443|4.0|This group was the follow-up to Steps, founded by Mike Mainieri. The group  consists of the following members: Mike Mainieri, Michael Brecker, Eliane  Elias, Eddie Gomez and the wonderful Peter Erskine on drums. Except for the  last cut all songs are well-crafted, written by different members of the  group, with the exception of the lovely &quot;Pools&quot;, written by the  late Don Grolnick. Best cut in my opninion is &quot;Islands&quot;, with  lovely solos by Mike Mainieri and Eliane Elias and the usual perfect  flowing drumming of Peter Erskine. Nice bonus is the pristine recording  quality. Highly recommended.
6305807086|5.0|&quot;Well, there's this guy....&quot; That's all that some viewers could really come up with when asked to describe &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, the latest film starring Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener and John Cusack. Oh...and John Malkovich is in it, too. This movie is so  original, I can't even begin to explain this movie, other than that it was  intelligent, fascinating, and hilarious. Because of the originality, it is  completely unpredictable: you are so completely in the dark trying to guess  what is going to happen next, that you end up not even bothering to  guess-which makes a great movie-going experience. <BR>  Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a puppeteer who believes he is not  just a puppeteer, but an artist. Diaz, in a wig that makes her nearly  unrecognizable, plays Schwartz' animal-loving wife, Lotte. Cusack, upon the  realization that he might not make it as a puppeteer, decides to get a day  job, at a place on the seventh and half floor of a New York skyscraper. It  is here at this odd office floor, that Cusack stumbles upon a portal to  John Malkovich's brain-where he is allowed to experience what it is like to  be a celebrity for 15 minutes, and then be spit out somewhere outside the  New Jersey turnpike. Hilarity ensues, and metaphysical questions are asked.  <BR>  This movie is like a dream-and not in the sense that it's an  incredibly great movie, although it is. It's like a dream because of the  way that the logic is formatted. Things that have seemingly little  significance, have a large significance by the movie's end. We are whisked  away from plotline to plotline, that soon the rhythm of the rapidfire plot  becomes catchy. Things that would not make sense in most movies makes  complete sense here. Being John Malkovich's intentional irrationality make  this a dadaistic masterpiece, a trend that I am unsure if I would want  duplicated, because perhaps then motion pictures would become a medium for  the insane. <BR> The writer, Charlie Kaufmann, is quoted as saying that he  wrote it not thinking that it would ever turn into a film. In response,  John Malkovich said that only a writer who did not think that their script  could become a film would write such a script. I'd have an inclination to  agree with Malkovich, unless it has become hip to produce scripts that are  risky, odd, and seemingly drug-induced. This may well be the one movie that  you should see this year. Josh Bob says check it out. Five stars.
B000002N2N|5.0|People often argue over who were the very first big Punk-rock band, and two of the closest contenders were the Ramones and the Sex Pistols, along with a few others. And people get quite annoyed if you disagree with their  point of view on this issue. Basically, this is a pointless arguement,  because the only thing that matters is the music and how good it is. The  Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Clash and many others were absolutely  excellent, so please Punkers, stop argueing POINTLESSLY and concentrate on  the music!    This album compliles some of the best and most recognised  hits from the Ramones, including great tunes such as Blitzkreig Bob and  Surfin' Bird. Although some aren't on there, ( such as 'Hit on the Brat'),  this is the best Ramones compilation available. So, dont argue, just go and  buy it!
B00003CWOL|4.0|Kevin Smith (&quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;Mallrats&quot; and&quot;Chasing Amy&quot;) continues to get better with each film. If&quot;End of Days&quot; does not sound like a fun Armageddon-themed film, try Dogma.  Dogma is fun, for sure, but not for the easily offended. S those who would prefer not to see angels use profanity, or the wrath (i.e. violence) of misguided angels of death, they should avoid this film like the plague.  Chris Rock also makes an appearance as the 13th apostle Rufus, who claims that he was left out of the Bible because he's black. Witty dialogue, plenty of pop culture references (Who's house? Run's house!) and some interesting philosophical questions make for a very entertaining way to spend an evening. The only negative aspects are the bad special effects (in one scene, there is a s--- demon that looks like something from &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;.) and a lame ending including an appearance by Alanis Morisette as God. It might've been four, but with the Alanis Morisette appearance, three stars. Josh Bob says check it out as a matinee, or pay full price and leave when &quot;God&quot; arrives ...
B000021XS0|5.0|The above title is not an exaggeration, Scenes is really that good. John Petrucci, who has displayed excellent guitar playing on each of the previous DT albums, only ups the ante one more notch here, and the same  goes for Portnoy, but there's no use discounting John Myung on bass either.  Jordan Rudess, the new keyboardist is absolutely amazing, he blows away  Kevin Moore and Derek Sherinian, and that is, of course, saying something.  His work is on par with classic stuff by Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson.  James's vocals are his best ever, his performance on The Spirit Carries on  is mesmerizing. This is an absolutely stunning album all around, it  features what is probably their best ever instrumental on Overture 1928,  and Home is one of their best overall songs. A masterpiece. BUY IT NOW!
B00003CX7K|4.0|The first Toy Story was amazing. CGI had never looked so good,and the humor was bizarre and hilarious, so both children and adultscould enjoy it. Adults and children are bound to love the sequel too, as shown by the film's $80 million opening weekend. OK, high profits aren't always a good indication of a great movie (take &quot;Titanic&quot; or &quot;Star Wars: Episode 1&quot; for example), but the high returns are actually justified in this one. In this film, Woody is kidnapped by an evil toy collector voiced by the-always-evil Wayne Knight (&quot;Seinfeld&quot;). Woody discovers not only his roots, but also the true meaning of family. A lot of people like the yodeling Jessie voiced by Joan Cusack, but I'd have to say that the best scenes involve Tim Allen and his duels with his nemesis Zurg. Pop culture references allow adults to get some jokes that kids might miss, but the kids will have a blast watching this animated adventure. This movie is more plot-oriented than the first--which kids will love--and is hence more fun. Josh Bob says check this out. Four stars.  END
B000001ESP|5.0|I have all the Rush albums (except the debut), and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is the best one. Of course, it has Tom Sawyer, one of their best ever songs, but that is hardly the only highlight. YYZ is  perhaps their best ever instrumental (that's quite a feat for a band that  wrote La Villa). Red Barchetta is excellent, and Limelight has some of  Neil's best ever lyrics. The Camera Eye, Witch Hunt, and Vital Signs, are  all excellent songs as well, and would be the best song on nearly any other  album by nearly any other band, if it was not for the other excellent  tracks on here. If you don't already have this album, and you consider  yourself a prog rock fan then you just have to ask yourself: What the hell  is wrong with me? Go ahead, and buy it, Permanent Waves, 2112, and  Different Stages, right now if you don't already have them all, because  Rush is one of the greatest bands of all-time, and you would be a fool not  to have at least a sampling of their catalog in your record collection.
B00000J7J4|1.0|How many times do they have to play &quot;Smooth&quot; on the radio?  100?  1,000?  For some REAL Santana, listen to some of his work around the &quot;Open Invitation&quot; era.  Supernatural sounds like the Backstreet  Boys produced it.
B000002H97|5.0|I have all the Met albums right here in my house, and this is definately the best of them (far outdistancing any other besides Master of Puppets, not to discount any of their other great albums, of course). Yeah, the  singles Sandman, Sad But True, Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Nothing  Else Matters, etc. are great, but so are some of the lesser known tracks.  Of Wolf And Man is an excellent song, a fact reinforced by Metallica, who  still play this song nightly. Through The Never is very good too, and so is  Don't Tread On Me. The God That Failed features Hammet's most underrated  solo of all-time, it is truly great. This is an album on par with AC/DC's  Back In Black, Iron Maiden's The Number of The Beast, and Aerosmith's Toys  In The Attic, it is simply a must-own. No wonder the two Load albums were a  letdown, how can you improve on perfection?
0425107469|5.0|Thrilling, suspenseful, heart wrenching and just down right genius. That's about all I have to say about that.
6300268470|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since it's first theatrical release.  When it was released on VHS I couldn't wait to buy it.  I rushed home to watch it and my excitement quickly turned to anger when I realized  that many of the original scenes which had been deleted when the movie was  released to television had NOT been added back for release to video.  I am  now wondering when this movie will be released on DVD, and if it is, will  it be in its original uncut version.  Considering that all of the stars of  the movie except Angie Dickinson are now dead, and that it is considered  one of the greatest westerns of all time, I think it would be a shame not  to release the DVD version of the movie with NO deleted scenes.
0767802470|5.0|This movie was fantastic.  I highly recommend you watch it all the way through (I made stops and took two days to complete the movie) and that you watch it in German with the subtitles.  This movie is so gripping... and  the ending will leave you stunned.  This is a must see for anyone - not  just submarine, military movie lovers.  Great action, great sound, great  movie!  DVD director's commentary is fascinating although I must admit I  didn't rewatch the entire movie to listen to it all.  DVD is the way to go  on this film!
B000002JS6|5.0|I am a progressive rock fan, and although I love listening to the genre's 20+ minute excesses, sometimes you just wanna turn it all off, and an album like this just hits the spot. No excesses, just minimalist, bonecrushing,  straight-ahead hard rock. It's amazing how good this album really is  considering what the band had been going through at the time, and the short  amount of time that it was written and recorded, with a new singer no less!  This is one of those albums that only comes around a couple of times per  decade. The only 80's albums that even compete with Back In Black are  Aerosmith's Pump, Metallica's Master of Puppets, and Rush's Moving  Pictures. It is really that good. The title track, Shook Me, Hells Bells,  Rock N' Roll..., Shoot To Thrill, all are excellent, as is Shake A Leg one  of the great AC/DC songs that hardly anybody ever mentions. Actually, every  single song on here is a classic. How many albums can you say that about?  Not many. Definately at Top 10 All-time Album.
6302878527|4.0|This is my all time favorite film.  No other film captures the romance and the truth of love quite so beautifully.  My heart melts every time I hear Finney say to Hepburn &quot;If you want to be a Duchess, be a Duchess.  If  you want to make love its hats off&quot;.  Hepburn says what most women  have said at one time or another to a man &quot;You don't know what love  is&quot;.
B000002C1W|4.0|Not the best Pink Floyd album by any means, but it is far better than it is given credit for. As one reviewer below said, the last three PF studio albums are the three most prejudiced albums in rock history. All of them  are good, and underappreciated, which is a damn shame. This is a good album  folks. Learning To Fly, is great, as everyone knows. But Sorrow is  brilliant, On The Turning Away is great too, and Terminal Frost is one of  the band's better instrumentals, a one on which Dave shows some nice  restraint, by not playing guitar very much on it. That said, there are some  songs that aren't very good. The Dogs of War, although not nearly as bad as  I once thought it to be, still isn't very good (the live version on DSOT is  a lot better). Also, the two part A New Machine is worthless. Overall  though, this is still a good album and worth your money. Sure, the lyrics  don't match Roger's, but hey, how can you expect Dave and his co-writers to  match one of the greatest lyric writers of all-time on one album? It simply  isn't fair to expect that. Look at Roger's first lyrical effort, Take Up  Thy Stethoscope and Walk, it is laughably bad! Corporal Clegg, etc. aren't  good either. He didn't write a good lyric until If, or arguably until Free  Four, and some would say not until Dark Side. So how can you expcect Dave  to equal a level that it took Roger 10 years to reach on his first album as  the main writer? You can't of course. But lyrics aside, the music is still  good throughout, with only a few weakpoints. I'd buy this.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I'll admit, i loathe all that is connected with pop music and teeny boppers.  I'll also admit that this isn't the worst thing i've ever heard.  Britney is a decent singer and certainly has presence.  And she has indeed  grown up from her paper-thin facade of a little schoolgirl.  But she also  sings incredibly predictable mainstream pop that seems recycled through  four or five groups/singers like her.  The cover of Satisfaction is really  hard to listen to and i found myself legitmately angry after hearing it.   Overall it is just really average pop garbage and i can only hope music  moves away from this lame mediocrity very soon.  In five years, we'll look  back at this era and laugh at these people like we do now at Samantha Fox  or New Kids On The Block.  Come on, kids, we can do better!
B000001DQI|5.0|The best album from Elton's abnormally large back catalog. The opening medley Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding is the best song on the album, one of the best album openers of all-time, Elton's best ever song,  and one of the top 10 or 15 songs of all-time! That song is literally worth  the price of the album alone, but it is FAR from the only highlight. Candle  In The Wind is Elton's famous ballad, and it has stood the test of time.  Bennie and The Jets, Grey Seal, This Song Has No Title, Saturday Night's  Allright For Fighting, the title track, and I've Seen That Movie Too are  all excellent songs. This is practically a greatest hits of brand new songs  (at least it was when it came out). You say you don't like piano? Don't  like Elton? Who cares? You'll still like this album. I used to think I  hated Elton John, but then I heard Dream Theater's A Change of Seasons  album, which features a cover of Funeral. I like the song so much I went  out and bought this album, and I have played it countless time since, along  with buying many of Elton's other albums. The plain fact is, no matter who  you are, this album belongs in your collection!
B00004T8RK|4.0|\\"No need to be void\\" rumbles Mr Vedder yet this perfectly describes the feeling of this, their 6th studio album - Binaural, and it seems there is every need for it. With the help of Tchad Blake, pioneering binaural studio  engineer, on several tracks this record sounds just that, like it's  recorded in a void...and it's beautiful, softening Pearl Jam's established  sound without losing any depth. Binaural (the ability to hear in both ears)  recording is a simple enough premise, using a Kunstkopf head, meaning  &quot;art head&quot; to do a lot of the recording. The head is designed to  simulate a real head and outer ear, inside each ear is placed an Omni  directional microphone to pick up sound evenly from all 360 degrees around  it, like our eardrum. Consequently the effect is that the production sounds  as though you're present in the studio, well, on the 4 Blake produced  tracks anyway.   Most should find this whole album a more accessible  experience with each track being much less abrasive than the tracks we've  been used to on the last 2 albums. This said, the more sensitive petals  amongst us may wish to skip through Evacuation and Grievance, these being  the harsher of the 13 tracks, but the whole album seems to chronicle the  change from adolescent angst to inspired adulthood that Pearl Jam have so  obviously undergone in the last few years.  The vocal melodies here seem  far subtler with the double tracked choruses to songs such as  Insignificance and Sleight Of Hand being nicely intricate enough to catch  the ear. We also experience Pearl Jam experimenting with more  unconventional time-changes than previously with tracks swinging into  bridges and middle-eighths  that have a casual half-time feel not unlike  early Stone Temple Pilots material. Comparisons don't stop here, the  opening `Breakerfall' strongly resembles anything Neil Young, the droning  constant bass of `Nothing As It Seems' is reminiscent of Radioheads  Climbing Up The Walls, while the intro to `Parting Ways' could very well be  a slowed down `America' by Neil Diamond. However none of this distracts  from the continuing unique writing of, now becoming `classic-rock  touchstones', Pearl Jam.  Binaural is warm and familiar and you can't help  but connect with it, not lyrically, but on an atmospherical level you just  feel at ease with it. It fits and it's comfortable.

B000002P2W|4.0|Steven Stolder's review hit the nail on the head: it's the Who's &quot;singer-songwriter&quot; record. Pete Townshend concentrates on the songs themselves, and not just the thrashing windmill guitar riffs and  flashy pyrotechnics. The result is one of the band's most mature albums  ever, without sacrificing any of the musical potency that has made them one  of the few &quot;classic rock&quot; bands to sustain respect after all  these years. &quot;However Much I Booze&quot; and &quot;How Many  Friends&quot; are my two favorites. The remaster contains excellent live  versions of &quot;Slip Kid&quot; and &quot;Squeeze Box,&quot; despite the  fact that they're marred by  WAY too much between-song chatter (which is  the only drawback of &quot;Live at Leeds,&quot; incidentally). There's also  a live version of &quot;Behind Blue Eyes,&quot; which is okay, but a bit  redundant considering the fact that the &quot;Who's Next&quot; reissue  contains an alternate take of that song already. Sorry, but IMHO that song  justisn't good enough to warrant umpteen alternate takes and live versions.  At any rate, this is a terrific disc that shows a side of the Who that the  casual fan is most likely unfamiliar with. It's the textbook definition of  an underrated gem.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Maybe I'm not being fair. But I really dislike this cd. Maybe it's the fact I'm really sick of ol' Brit, or maybe it's the fact SHE KILLED THE ROLLING STONES SONG!  Am I the only one who hates what she did to it?   Mick, Keith and the rest of the Stones : what were thinking when you  allowed this to happen to your music !
B000002ADT|5.0|I purchased the original (inferior) CD release of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; in 1993 and it immediately became one of the most treasured discs in my collection. The disc has taken jazz ten steps further, with some of the  most beautiful, stunning improvisation ever commited to tape. When Columbia  remastered and repackaged it recently, I knew I had to get the new version.  I didn't think this disc could ever be improved, but they did it! Along  with tons of great photos and liner notes, the sound quality is even better  than before (and a few of the songs that were originally recorded at the  wrong speed have been fixed). It even contains an alternate take. Jazz fans  are doing themselves a huge disservice if they are not purchasing this disc  at once. If you're not a jazz fan, give this one a try. It deserves a place  in EVERYONE's collection. Miles, you were a genius. Rest in peace.
B00004T8RK|5.0|For once Pearl Jam has lived up to their potential. I've been excited about their turn towards band cohesiveness since No Code. The Pearl Jam of the last few years has been willing to experiment with eclectic and diverse  sounds to create a new and more accomplished whole album. Past popular  favorites like Ten featured sweeping rock anthems, such as  &quot;Evenflow&quot; and &quot;Alive,&quot; and were essentially mindless  in content and heavy on arena-rock hi-jinx. They presumed to be  &quot;heavy&quot; songs that were &quot;about&quot; something. For the few  years that followed Ten we could all sit in isolation and commiserate with  Eddie Vedder's tortured lyrics. How pretensious. There was no interaction  of form and content, just four guys trying to accentuate the efforts of  their fearless leader. <br />Pearl Jam since No Code has embarked on a more  adventurous path. Although they're musical influences have become more  apparent, they are not merely recycling the sounds of their favorite  predecessors. If &quot;Smile&quot; on No Code was pure Neil Young, who was  &quot;In My Tree&quot; taken from? Artists experiment with what came  before, adjust their perameters, and create anew. Binaural is an  accomplished point along the path of a band that has made a conscious  decision to be a band. They have channeled the erratic emotions of  yesterday's efforts and injected them into more cohesive and organic  musical structures. There are no mindless anthems in Binaural. The content  is as political as ever, but there is a vibrant aesthetic component to  match, rather than a lot of melodramatic rock theatrics.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Pearl Jam seems to be following in the footsteps of their hero Neil Young. They are so concerned about being commercial they are alienating all of their fans.  Considering the talent in this band it is definitely a  tragedy. This CD has very few keepers on it. The highlights are &quot; of  the girl&quot; and &quot;Sleight of hand&quot;. The rest are equal to  anything you will find in the bargain bin at your local music store. Even  the 1st single released off the CD does not match what Pearl Jam has  released as &quot;B&quot; sides of their singles in the past. Eddie Vedder  has one of the best voices around and he chooses not to let anyone  appreciate it. I just hope the next CD will not take 2 years and be this  big of a disappointment. Hopefully the tour will be better. 2 stars! Just  because it is Pearl Jam and I am not the editor at Rolling Stone which  would give PJ 5 stars for passing wind.

0684833395|3.0|I've never read a book that was so ironic, funny and confusing like this one. It had crazy characters, most of them you can't relate to. And like the title, there was a catch, bureaucracy (or hipocracy) to almost every  thing.  I enjoyed the book. but be warned, you'll find yourself rereading  paragraphs that just make no sense the first time around.

B000002MFN|4.0|When this album was released, it was to coinside with the &quot;Sex&quot; book and the film &quot;Body of Evidence.&quot; First off, the book and movie - they were great! Anyways, the album got lost in a Madonna backlash  and a lot of people didn't get it. S&amp;M? Oral Sex? Oh no! It's the Right  Wing! Listen, after the few sex songs, there are some excellent tracks,  &quot;Thief of Hearts,&quot; &quot;Words,&quot; &quot;Rain,&quot; &quot;Bad  Girl,&quot; &quot;Bye Bye Baby,&quot; &quot;Secret Garden.&quot; All of  them rock. &quot;In This Life&quot; is about AIDS, and although a sad song,  kind of slow and boring. And &quot;Did You Do It?&quot; Hello cheese! Two  white guys rapping about sleeping with Maddy. Big fun - not! There are more  good tracks then bad on this CD, so don't miss out!
B00004SCX6|1.0|I have absolutely no respect for Britney as an artist. I've never met her, so I cannot say I hate her. But she, along with N Sync, BSB, 98*, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, whomever, they need to start writing some of their  own songs, playing their own instruments, and cut it out with the cheesy  dancing. It's really a shame how so many of you are so blind to real music,  and letting these artists with only singing talent (not much at that,  either) reign at the top of the charts. Tsk tsk.
B000002MUW|3.0|This is, in my opinion, one of Madonna's less-than-stellar albums. It's not a constructive whole like other albums like &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; or &quot;Erotica,&quot; but there are some good songs. You get awesome  tracks in &quot;Human Nature,&quot; &quot;I'd Rather Be Your Lover,&quot;  &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and the title-track that was co-written by Iceland  diva Bjork, &quot;Bedtime Story.&quot; But with the good, you get the bad.  &quot;Survival,&quot; the terribly monotonous &quot;Secret&quot; (buy the  maxi of Secret, way better), the way too perky &quot;Don't Stop&quot; the  boring &quot;Inside of Me&quot; &amp; &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; and the  terribly over played &quot;Take A Bow&quot; are all basically album fillers  if you ask me. This is good if only for Human Nature &amp; Bedtime Story,  but other than that, eh, take it or leave it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album is an instant success as well as a new classic.  Throughout their career, Metallica has entertained fans throughout the world. The band's new album, S&amp;M, is no exception.  This double CD set combines  the brilliant performance of Metallica with the outstanding power of  Michael Kamen and the San Francisco Orchestra.  The tracks on the CD range  from classics such as &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, &quot;Master of  Puppets&quot;, and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, to newer songs such  as &quot;Fuel,&quot; &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;, and &quot;Devil's  Dance&quot;, and even introduces two previously unreleased tracks &quot;No  Leaf Clover&quot; and &quot;Minus Human&quot;.  It has been said that  Metallica fans today are unhappy because the band has become too soft.  I  think that these skeptics will be happy with the CD because the sheer power  of the band/orchestra combination is mind blowing. As soon as this album  hit the shelves I went out and bought it.  The new song &quot;No Leaf  Clover&quot; was an instant hit in my hometown and it helped to keep  S&amp;M the most popular CD in town for several weeks.  I highly recommend  this album to any hard-core Metallica fan, anyone who likes Metallica, or  just plain anyone who wants to experience some awesome music.  Just in case  you didn't realize it, THIS CD ROCKS!
B000002HH2|4.0|I remember being about 10 or 11 years old and being frightened out of my mind by the scary Bjork lady dancing around on a truck on MTV. Sufficet to say, I couldn't understand why she was getting rave reviews. A coupla years  later I saw her on Jay Leno singing a big-band song and loved it. The  screaming was a little odd for me, but I recanted and bought the single to  &quot;It's Oh So Quiet.&quot; Can you say, &quot;Excellent&quot;? I  immediately went out and purchased this CD, &quot;Post&quot; and was blown  away at how awesome it is! There are so many good songs on here, it is  definitley a CD everyone should own. Don't miss it! And by the way, Bjork  being scary just makes her oh so much more appealing, wouldn't you say?
B00000IPAX|5.0|I love this album.  It's the first punk album i have bought and it's fantastic.  My favorite songs are Adams song and all the small things.  I would recommend this to everyone-it's fantastic!
B000001FI7|5.0|Words can't do justice to the mood and atmosphere of this album! It is both eerie and irresistable, and the instrumentation and production are incredible. Sad to say, I'm so captured by the music and mood of this album  that I haven't had to pay attention to the lyrics in all the songs, but the  ones I have have been superior. The seductive voice, the neon-light  blinking in your hotel room window from outside guitar...WOW!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Most of the artists I like either aren't making albums anymore or aren't making GOOD albums anymore. Pearl Jam is the only group left whose new albums I eagerly anticipate. One of the reasons is that I know each new  release is going to be nothing like the previous (except for the  packaging). Change can be good or bad. With Pearl Jam albums, change is  definitely a plus. It's good to see them trying new things. As good as the  first album is, I'm glad Pearl Jam has chosen to evolve musically rather  than give us a string of &quot;Jeremy&quot;s over the last few years (I  guess that would be the other alternative). &quot;Binaural&quot; is a great  rock album to enjoy until Pearl Jam surprises us with another one. Thanks  for reading.
6304117752|5.0|&quot;The Happiest sound in all the world&quot;? Quite possibly and easily  the most famous musical film in Hollywood history. Most of us grown-ups  still love it but at the same time we're also tired of seeing it over and  over again (maybe that's why it's not rerun on NBC every single year  anymore. I havn't seen it rerun since the Easter Season '95). Julie Andrews  takes her &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; success and adds even more to it with  her delightful rendition of the role that Mary Martin made her own on the  Broadway stage in 1959 and ran even farther with it than Martin ever could.  In my opinion, and I don't think I'm alone here, but I think that Martin  was too old for the part (she was in her mid to late 40s in the stage  version and Andrews was 30 when the transition to film came around--a  perfect age). As for the rest of the cast, it is just as talented:  Christopher Plummer, in the role he will forever be remembered for is a  achingly true Captain Von Trapp with those &quot;hidden talents&quot;  making subtle appearances throughout the film until blatantly bursting out  into the open in the film's closing scenes; Richard Haydn makes for a  comical and yet sincere &quot;Uncle&quot; Max, Peggy Wood is a starchy yet  compassionate Reverand Mother and Charmian Carr as Liesl stands out as our  perennial favorite of the seven children. The locales are breathtaking as  well (esp. the opening scene which is probably the most beatiful aerial  shot in all of film history and the cunning floral designs of the public  Austrian gardens during the &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; sequence). So let's all  keep watching this most cheerished of all musical films each year and never  forget it's tasteful sentiment: to 'climb ev'ry mountain, ford ev'ry  stream, follow ev'ry rainbow till you find your dream'.
B00001PE4D|4.0|This movie will take you on a roller-coaster ride of laughs, women and ultimately, tragedy.  Not once during this movie did I think of the time, get restless in my chair or fidget!<br />The length of the movies perfect, the  acting is good from the young cast, the soundtrack is excellent and the  humour is spot on.  I dare you not too like this movie! <br />A lot has  been made about this film being a re-make.  This is nonsense!  The original  was designed for the older audience while this film is made for the younger  generation!  By this, I mean 18+.<br />This film is surely inspired by the new  style of MTV movie that has just come around.  By this I mean young cast  and good sountrack and you've got a hit.  The difference, the humour and  content of this film is adult.  There's not even a hint of a after school  party where there will be kegs of beer!  It's sophisticated and can be  enjoyed by the adults as well.<br />Buy this film, you won't be sorry that you  did!

B00000DHRX|5.0|I have been a fan of George Michael's since &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot;.  Since then, I have grown up, and so has George's music.  He has never given his fans anything less than perfect pop music.  He is one  of the few artists whose new albums (alas, with George, they are too few  and far between) I will buy without hearing a single song.<br />For the  uninitiated, &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentleman&quot; provides a great  introduction to Michael's music.  I disagree with those who call Disc 1  tiresome--I love &quot;Father Figure&quot;, &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;,  &quot;A Different Corner&quot; and (especially) &quot;Cowboys and  Angels&quot;.  Disc 2 is lots of fun--I dare you not to dance when it's on!   One day a co-worker and I cranked up this disc when no one else was in the  office...I've never had such fun at work.  (I paid the extra cash for the  import version, which is worth every penny for the wonderful &quot;As&quot;  duet with Mary J. Blige.  It's a pity this was taken off the U.S.  version.)<br />The album provides a good overview of &quot;Faith&quot;,  &quot;Listen Without Prejudice&quot; (a highly underrated work), and  &quot;Older&quot;.  Hopefully listeners of &quot;Ladies &amp;  Gentleman&quot; will be inspired to pick up some (or all) of these  albums.<br />Everyone I know that has or has listened to this album loves it.   George, you still have a lot of true fans over here in America.  Please  come back and see us sometime!
6301966562|5.0|Remember when you used to go down to the local book store to get the latest copy of &quot;videogaming illustrated&quot; or &quot;electronic games&quot; ? Remember when you used to spend summers in the arcade playing  pacman and pole position, then go home to the 2600 ? San Francisco was the  place, computers were &quot;the next big thing&quot; and nerds were getting  noticed. This movie made me want to live in SF, work for Activison or Atari  and drive over the Golden gate on a sunny day ! Great movie ! I have the CD  but really want the DVD. Are you listening MGM ?
B000035P7X|5.0|If you're already a fan of this film, you'll know what I'm talking about, and will really appreciate the DVD for the bonus features. The commentary added a lot of information that was new to me.<br />This movie remains fun to  watch, even after repeated viewings. <br />The audio track suppliments are  another great extra on this disc.
B0000041Q3|4.0|Who said Caballe only sing pianissimo? There is a live recording of Turandot by Caballe and Pavarotti, that one is vocally better than this one for those who love true Puccini's Turandot. But that one is a live  recording. To me Nilson and Marton sound more like angry grandmothers  instead of young princess, they might do better if there were some arias  for the hundreds years old Princess Lou Ling...
0140186409|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a sobering account of the lives of a midwesterner family that takes place barely fifty years ago. What's even more sobering about it is that the general events in this story are true!<br />Meet the Joad  family --a hardworking Oklahomian family living happily on the farm they  have lived on for years. *BAM* the Dust Bowl strikes and they are forced to  sell their assets at a ridiculously low price and buy a cheap jalopy for a  price twice as high as it should be. So this family does what most any  families would have done if they were in this sort of situation: move to  California, a place that promises great riches and prosperity. But when  they get there, it quite the opposite (I don't want to give much away after  this point).<br />Really, everybody ought to read this classic. We must do  everything we can to keep this part of American history from repeating  itself.<br />A great book on all accounts with great dialogue and a  well-constructed storyline. A must read!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The Battle of Los Angeles is the equivalent of a musical machine gun. Once it kicks in, there's no stopping it - relentless, uncompromising, and seizing the epitome of rap/metal's edgy essence. &quot;Anger is a  gift.&quot; Zack de la Rocha, the fanatic frontman of Rage hissed on their  1992 self-titled. Well, Rage Against the Machine have been blessed with a  tremendous gift and they push their gift to its bursting limits on The  Battle of Los Angeles. If their self-titled was a dynamite, The Battle of  Los Angeles slams like an atomic bomb clearing all opposition out of the  way. This is to Rage, as Fear of A Black Planet was to Public Enemy. And  Rage Against the Machine rock the political arena with an equal ferocity  and conviction as Chuck D. and the gang. Gone are the frills of  album-fillers from Rage's hip-hop/metal funk peers, but drills forward with  the momentum of a semi-truck, not once letting up on the visceral sound or  energy. Its immediate and in-your-face music. This makes rap/metal all the  more of an effective tool for de la Rocha's rapid spit-fire vocals and  Morello's guitar work. Musically aside, The Battle of Los Angeles leaps  bounds lyrically. &quot;Where burning batons beat the freezing who  shake/Under toxic sunsets they dine and toast/Their walls deny the terror  faced by the children born as ghosts.&quot; Zack de la Rocha whispers  fashioning bleak, desolate images. The lyrical subject attacks specific  political subjects ranging from Mumia, Leonard Peltier, and sweat shops  large improvement from 1992's &quot;Killing In The Name&quot;'s defiant  chorus. Zach de la Rocha's vocals are still the explosive spit-fire  screaming raps, but on The Battle of Los Angeles, he drops to deathly  menancing whispers conveying a sense of quiet urgency. The Battle of Los  Angeles opens with a rising drum roll and de la Rocha's grunt kicks in  &quot;Testify&quot;, with Morello's paranoid guitar winding in the  background. Morello's scratching, screeching, reeling guitar are the  highlights of the songs, elevating Zack de la Rocha's solos to blazing,  lofty heights. On &quot;Mic Check&quot;, a haunting, bubbling guitar solo  drapes stuttering vocals, only to follow in with fluttering bass lines and  turntable-like guitar sounds, all dropping away to reveal a lonely  twinkling guitar plinking dancing around Zack de la Rocha's vicious  delivery. &quot;Sleep Now In The Fire&quot; is perhaps Morello's most  convential guitar work, but nonetheless powerfully executed with de la  Rocha's growling tortured entrance, driven by Brad Wilk's clattering drums.  &quot;Maria&quot; is a dazzling display of Zack de la Rocha's vocal prowess  as he weaves a frightening, bone-chilling story of a sweat-shop workers who  meets a tragic, terrifying death. Reading through &quot;Maria&quot;'s  lyrics, you don't believe that anyone could pull it off, but Zack de la  Rocha does with convicing reality as well. Even at the end of the album,  &quot;War Within a Breath&quot; doesn't let up, and by the time the album  ends you're head is pounding ,your blood is rushing, and your palms are  sweaty. And you're ready for more. The victory of this battle goes to Rage  Against the Machine.
0060235152|5.0|My 16-month old daughter loves to turn her head, wave her arms, raise her shoulders, with the colorful animals in this book.  Excellent book to teach children body parts, movements and animals.  (She surprised us one day by  thumping her chest when she saw a gorilla picuture somewhere else.)  I also  read this book to her classmates in a play group and they all loved it,  too.  Have fun &quot;bending your knees&quot; with your kids!
B00004T8RK|5.0|ok folks some critics are not giving good reviews to this cd..WHO CARES? find out for yourself..not everyone likes pearl jam though i dont see how they dont..pearl jam rule..anywayz this cd is a step up for pearl jam..it  sorta reminds you of a mix-in of VITALOGY and YIELD.It's not their best cd  but it's not far behind and includes some of their best  work.&quot;breakerfall&quot; is the opener and sorta remionds you of  how  &quot;brain of j&quot; grandiosly opened YIELD. its a great rock track with  vedder's voice sorta echoing in the lyrics.another standout is &quot;light  years&quot; probably the softest song on the cd and a darn good one.we all  know how good &quot;nothing as it seems is..having heard it on the  radio..&quot;thin air&quot; also is destined to be the next single..it is a  beautiful old-fashioned song..&quot;insignificance&quot; is one of the  strongest songs on the track..it has a great chorus and wonderful guitars  and sounds better here than on the single..also &quot;grievance&quot; is  the hardest song , vedder sounds great bellowing out the lyrics..all in all  not bad for a group thats been around 10 yrs. they havent missed a beat yet  and will hopefully continue to entertain us for years to come!
630575067X|4.0|If you are judging this movie based on all the other movies out there, this is definitely near the top of the heap.<br />However, Star Wars films will always be judged by a higher standard. &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;  doesn't quite make it up to the level of the first three.<br />This isn't just  nostalgia for the old films that's causing me to say this. All in all,  &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; was just a bit weaker than the others.<br />For  example, the characters weren't quirky enough for you to really get to love  them. The two Jedi's were both quite serious, the queen wasn't all that  interesting, and the bad guys really didn't terrify me the same way Darth  Vader could.  There needed to be someone like Han to liven things up  (though I do have to say that Anakin was a strength of this movie).<br />I  know that was supposed to be JarJar's role, but please...I couldn't laugh  at him because he got so annoying by the middle of the movie. Add that to  the fact that it was very difficult to understand him, and one wonders if  Lucas is having any second thoughts about the huge role JarJar  got.<br />However, much so ink has already been spilled about JarJar that I  won't belabor the point.<br />The big battle scene at the end kept reminding  me of the strikingly similar scene in &quot;Jedi.&quot; The feeling of  dejavu was so strong that it left me wondering if the writers could have  made this one a little fresher.<br />All that said, the special effects and  animation was excellent. The plot, while not too deep, kept me interested.  Overall it's not a bad movie, but Star Wars fans are hoping for something a  little better with Episode II.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Being a huge music fan, and also being a moderate pearl jam fan i was excited to hear the new album. I was used to the normal pearl jam album, four or five brilliant songs and the rest getting skipped over, but i must  say i was truly dissapointed with this album. Eddie Vedder seems distant  and doesnt connect with the flow of the songs, the music is sometimes to  much to handle, to much at once i suppose. If you like pearl jam, buy the  live on two legs album, not this one, you will find yourself putting it in  the back of your cd collection.
0880793082|5.0|I find the Crowley deck consistently accurate for tarot readings. These cards are not like the Rider Waite (another fine deck) but they offer very valuable information that the Rider Waite deck does not seem equipped to  handle. For example, the Crowley deck is fabulous for Pagans, since its  themes combine many Spiritual disciplines such as Alchemy, the Cabala,  Magic, Astrology, Celt traditions and Mediterranean influences. The Crowley  deck can therefore be interpretated across a broad spectrum of religions.  Additionally, Crowley was not shy about sexual matters and his deck  reflects his deep understanding of sexual nuances, which is something that  the Rider Waite seems to avoid. The suit of Wands is depicted in connection  with passion in a very emphasized manner and it expresses the fire and  exuberance of the sex drive as a represenation of essential passion.  Crowley emphasizes the dialectical nature between passion/temperance,  masculine/feminine, inner/outer expression, subjective/universal themes.  Crowley also represents the gender divide in very comprehensive manner.  Crowley offers a princess, a prince, a queen and a knight, which  corresponds to the Rider's page, knight, queen and king respectively. An  absolutely excellent companion book/manual for these cards is written by  German author Hajo Banzhaf (available in English) who is an internationally  acclaimed astrologist and tarot reader/interpreter. I find him  indespensible,and far more lucid than Crowley, since his intereptations for  the Crowley deck (and one of his books offers a Crowley/Waite comparison  interpretation for each card) are straight foreward and right on the mark.  The Crowley deck is an artistic masterpiece and its designs are very  lovely. This is one deck that I highly recommend!
B00000634J|5.0|Lennon solo was always an infuriating listen. Each of the individual albums had their fair share of good and not-so-good cuts. Wading through it all, especially for non-fans like myself, was often-times frustrating and  despairing. Collections was an OK anthology, but &quot;No.9 Dream&quot; was  the truncated 45-rpm version and not the far more whistful album track.  Shaved Fish was OK, but the sound remastering left an awful lot to be  desired. Legend rights all wrongs and includes all the key tracks from the  entirety of his solo career. And that's how it should be. Of course he was  with The Beatles. And fans can go to the Beatles albums for his best stuff  with the group. Adding them to this release would have done his solo output  little justice. At the core of these releases lies what made Lennon great:  his political/religious stance, his romanticism, his passion for life. From  the intense set-up of &quot;Instant Kharma&quot; to the Elton John co-lead  on &quot;Whatever gets You Through The Night&quot;, from &quot;Stand By  Me&quot; to &quot;(Just Like)Starting Over&quot;, Legend paints a bold  picture using the artist's finest moments. It's one of the best albums I  own and a desert island disc. Absolutely essential!
B000002UDB|5.0|Ive tried to give the Beatles less then five star but I just cant do it.Honest!Any CD with &quot;I am the walrus&quot;,&quot;Strawberry fields forever&quot;,&quot;Penny lane&quot;,&quot;Flying&quot;,&quot;Magical  mystery tour&quot; &amp; &quot;Fool on the hill&quot; cannot be given  anything less by a sane person.This is the album Brian Wilson wished he  could have made.Essential litening,BUY IT NOW!
B00004T8RK|3.0|I have always been a huge Pearl Jam fan, but this album is not their best effort. A few of the songs are destined to  be PJ classics, but the album on the whole is not very good. I used to be able to listen to PJ's other  albums all the way through without having to skip tracks, but this is not  the case with Binaural. I just hope that the next album is better. Is this  the end for Pearl Jam?
B000002MY3|5.0|The songs change from track to track, some joyful, some angry, some foul-mouthed, some gentle. What I can say about every single song however, is that they are entertaining and interesting. If it isn't the lyrics, it's  the rhythm, if it isn't the rhythm, is the use of instruments. I think that  this album has a lot to offer to a lot of different people, which is  probably why it's sold 30 million copies.<br />AND, I think that her next  album was better than this one.
B000023VR6|3.0|First of all lets get this straight, this is a good album but it is not even close to being better then the first Chronic.  The first Chronic is probably the best rap album ever.  Dr. Dre's second album,Aftermath, was  ok.  This is a notch above Aftermath.  Overall the songs are weak but there  a strong songs that make up for other ones in it.  Snoop Dog should have  been in this a lot more I really dont know why he was not.  Buy this CD but  only buy it because its a Dr. Dre CD.
0812505085|5.0|Treasure Island is one of a small number of books that are both for children and adults.  The appeal of the book for children relates to the story line:  pirates, buried treasure, sea voyages to faraway places, and a  boy hero.  The appeal of the book for adults is in seeing a wonderful  example of how events operate at many different levels.  Long John Silver  quickly becomes the focus for adults.  What is his true nature?  What will  he do next?  Clearly, Silver is one of the most interesting and memorable  of all fictional characters.<br />A problem that children will have with  this book is that the language is somewhat foreign to them.  Some adults  and children will find that the book starts slowly compared to newer novels  (which often have the equivalent of a chase sequence in the first 5 pages).<br />My advice is to stick with the story for the first 6 chapters, and see  how you are doing.  By that time, the story will either have cast its spell  on you, or you will be able to tell that this book is not for you.<br />A  final reason for reading Treasure Island is because the book has been read  by so many people.  You will find references to the story in other  literature and in conversation with others.  You will also run into  establishments called The Admiral Benbow Inn.  It would be a shame not ot  know its heritage.  Also, finding someone else who likes Jim Hawkins and  Long John Silver for the same reasons you do is a great shortcut to  becoming better acquainted.<br />Personally, I found the story irresistible.  I would have written a very similar book if I had the skill to do so.  The  plot is nicely balanced, and the characters provide an unusual perspective  for what could easily have been a real potboiler with little to recommend  it.  The book has great charm, given its focus on pirates, which makes it  compelling for me.  I have now read the book 3 times, and enjoyed it more  each time.<br />Have a great read!
B00003CXDV|1.0|This movie stunk! I was soo hoping it would be good, but it wasn't. I'm sorry. I actually had to stop the madness and shut it off with about 30 minutes to go.<br />The plot was decent, and I really thought with the good  cast it would be hysterical, but it was not to be. I found I only mildly  chuckled, and before I knew it, I was more than a hour into the  movie.<br />The guy from &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot; plays a really annoying  alien that makes you grind your teeth.<br />If you want laughs, I'd look  elsewhere!
B00004STPT|5.0|The music scored for Gladiator might be different from what some might expect from a Roman epic movie.  I wonder if Miklos Rozsa was still around what he might have done.  I did think Han Zimmer did a wonderful job with  the score.  The music grows on you if you really listen to it.  Zimmer uses  a catchy theme in the Battle and Barbarian Horde tracks that leaves one  wanting more.  I have listen to those two tracks dozens of times and have  never tired.  This soundtrack has music that everyone should enjoy and  appreciate.  I would expect an Academy Award Nomination on this one.
B000020617|5.0|Finally, it seems that Dave Grohl has eliminated the ghosts that seemed to linger from Nirvana. While the first single 'Learn To Fly' is MTV and radio friendly, the rest of the CD is great. Most people would say that the Foo  Fighters have sold out. I say they have only to the point to get some damn  radio and video play. Great guitar hooks and fresh melodies make this a  great album, but still not as good as The Color And The Shape(Their best  album). The Foo Fighters are the best post Nirvana grunge band out there.  Take a listen to this CD, you won't be disappointed.
B00000JG41|5.0|This review is not going to be long!  It`s been a while since the last offering from bungle, but it was well worth the wait. This is what it`s all about folks! Patton at his vocal best, with second to none..... musical  genius!  This will go down as one of my favourite albums of all time  because of it`s versatility, every track is a beast!  TOP TRACK : Vanity  Fair. Mike, we need more!
B00000JCB2|4.0|While most people write off Limp Bizkit as a bunch of sellouts, I say that Fred has matured a little(listen to Re-Arranged), but he still has that angry little child inside(listen to the unoriginal Break Stuff, and the  moronic Show Me What You Got). It seems that Fred still has a need to get a  listner friendly song on the radio. This album is a far cry from the angst  ridden and loud heavy metal cruncher that is Three Dollar Bills Yall, and I  do think that those teenyboppers who suddenly like Limp because of this  album will probably be turned off by their first album which is more heavy  metal than this ever will be. Ok, so Fred and Limp are making money, but  they have sold out! Go back to your metal roots Fred!
B00004SCX6|4.0|This album sounds pretty much (or maybe too much) like her first album. That can be both the strong point and the weak point. This is because those who like her first album (that includes me) will then surely like this one,  but again, those who don't like her first album will probably not like it.  If you ask me, I will say it's a great album. Britney doesn't disappoint  her fans at all. My most favorite song in this album is &quot;Girl In The  Mirror,&quot; which is not included in the US version. If you love the song  &quot;Sometimes&quot;, you'll also like this song. The other songs are all  great. You can listen through the whole album without having to skip any  songs. Buy this album if you're Britney's fans or if you like the song  &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again.&quot; You won't be disappointed!
B00003ETJQ|5.0|It´s a risk to review a video like this. You either become clichéd or sound truly naive. It doesn´t matter. It´s really refreshing to feel that, even though any viewer may have traveled to or watched images of some of  these places, this astonishing film makes you feel that you belong to this  world and, still, you don't know much about it. Secuences like those from  Nepal, Bali or China will certainly encourage your need for traveling and  knowing other cultures and sights.  On the other hand, the video quality is  superb,70 mm. looks very similar to IMAX and the music posseses your soul  for 104 minutes and takes you &quot;there&quot; as you visit some of the  most puzzling and beautiful places on earth.<br />If you want to enhance your  DVD collection, Buy This!
B00004T8RK|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  It starts off rockin' hard, ends up on a tender note, and blows your mind in between.  After a couple of two plus minute burners, PJ turns inward for one of their most meaningful songs yet,  &quot;Light Years.&quot;  Amazing atmosphere and lyrics make this song a  strong contender for next single.  Then there's a stretch of three  incredible songs that just fit perfectly.  &quot;NAIS&quot; &quot;Thin  Air,&quot; and &quot;Insignificance&quot; just bleed into each other and  share energy.   The albums best rocker &quot;Grievance&quot; shows up late  in the album just to keep your attention.  The sonic tones of &quot;Of the  Girl&quot; impress.  &quot;Rival,&quot; a look at the Columbine tragedy is  an interesting experimentation.  The three final songs, &quot;Sleight of  Hand,&quot; &quot;Soon Forget,&quot; and &quot;Parting Ways&quot; are a  perfect ending to the album.  This album dares you to listen to it, and it  will not be soon forgotten!
B000002AZ8|4.0|Pearl Jam's third CD begins at a blistering pace with three great songs: \\"Last Exit,\\" \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" and \\"Not For You.\\" Each of these tunes possess what made PJ so irresistible in the first place: tuneful and full guitar chords; passionate, meaningful lyrics; drums that are full of bouncing life; and a sense of excitement to be writing and recording music for the masses, even if the band denied it at the time. \\"Spin the Black Circle\\" is an especially searing track, where Eddie Vedder endearingly and loudly proclaims his love of actual vinyl records, which includes the anticipation of placing them on the turntable and hearing them play. His severe vocals ring true right next to amazingly fresh and potent guitar playing that announces PJ is back with a vengeance after two huge previous albums.<br /><br />All these songs are great in their own way, and I always felt they represented PJ's truly best work up to 1994 -- yes, even better than the tunes on [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] and [[ASIN:B0000028UK Vs.]] \\"Nothingman,\\" for instance, is reflective, sad and beautiful, and may have been the softest track PJ had written in its first three years of existence. \\"Immortality,\\" a tune cut of the same mellow, lyrically dispiriting cloth, is even stronger.<br /><br />\\"Pry to\\" blesses the middle portion of \\"Vitalogy\\" with a quick and groovy 1970s disco-like vibe, accompanied by Vedder's hazy vocals, and that's followed by the much more focused \\"Corduroy,\\" one of Vedder's most impassioned pleas for personal privacy and a vitriolic but classy rip at the hardships of dealing with fame. Elsewhere, \\"Vitalogy\\" just flat out rocks with tunes such as \\"Whipping\\" and \\"Satan's Bed,\\" two fast gems that set the house afire when PJ play them live. Songs like these make the more bizarre fare on \\"Vitalogy,\\" such as the drunken-sounding \\"Bugs\\" and the downright weird \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me,\\" more tolerable.<br /><br />Vitalogy supposedly means the study of life or something like that, but you won't want to follow the dated advice shared in the unique CD booklet to fix what ails you. Likewise, Vedder and his band mates may not always have been coming from the most positive, stable place when making this record. Still, from the oscillating guitar licks on \\"Tremor Chirst\\" to the smooth rhythmic groove of \\"Aye Davanita,\\" one can easily appreciate the way PJ was growing musically during this period. \\"Vitalogy\\" has evolved into a classic CD, and it's one that every true fan of Pearl Jam should own, in order to hear the beginning of the band's musical evolution.ut you won't want to follow the dated advice shared in the unique CD booklet to fix what ails you.

6304178352|4.0|First, the wonderful score.  Frederic Loewe's glorious music is perfectly complimented by Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics, as on the Broadway and London stages, and almost every song is memorable and great.  Second, the  gloriously witty script, filled with great lines, many taken directly from  Shaw, on whose play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; this was based, and sharp  commentary on Britain's class system.  Third, the all-around wonderful  performances, from Rex Harrison's arch, arrogant, gleeful Henry Higgins to  Audrey Hepburn's charming but unrefined flower girl who becomes a  sophisticated (and stunning-looking) lady, to Stanley Holloway's lovable  amoral father of Hepburn, to Wilfred Hyde-White's Colonel Pickering, to  Gladys Cooper's Mrs. Higgins, just as acerbic as her son.  Fourth, the  much-lauded stunning look of the film, with gorgeously stylized costumes by  Cecil Beaton and fine sets by Beaton.  All the ingredients are there for a  great film, and under George Cukor's direction, that's pretty much what you  get.<br />And yet, the film is noticably flawed.  Hepburn, while charming and,  of course, stunningly dressed, does not give a bad performance by any  means; it's just that she's not overwhemingly sympathetic.  And her voice  double, Marni Nixon, has a lovely voice, but doesn't really put any emotion  into her songs, forcing that ever-present question to re-emerge: Would  Julie Andrews, the Broadway and London Eliza, have been a better choice?   Also, Nixon and Hepburn really do not sound alike, which is slightly  annoying.  (Nevertheless, most of Nixon's songs, especially &quot;I Could  Have Danced All Night,&quot; do come off well, and if Andrews had been  cast, there'd be no &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;)  &quot;On The Street Where  You Live,&quot; which I consider the best and most beautiful song in the  score, is given a rather flat reading by Bill Shirley, the voice double for  actor Jeremy Brett; it is the only song in the movie that is truly  forgettable, butthat is Shirley's fault entirely, NOT Lerner or Loewe's.   Too bad.  And yes, the movie is a bit long.  But overall, it's a vastly  entertaining, enjoyable, romantic, and great experience, just not without  flaw.  But, oh, well.
B000002MIF|5.0|When the time came for me to be initiated into the Smiths, my elder brother was the one to talk to.  His worn out copy of 'Louder Than Bombs' was the precursor, but even he admitted when I came home with a cassette  version of &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot;, that this was the real  thing.<br />Most of the British bands never achieve the levels of their first  few recordings, and while most purists claim &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;  is the one to buy, anybody who's anybody knows that such a statement is  patently false.<br />From start to finish, the whole album is a complete  work, and drastically improves on the ball-less debut album, especially  with regard to production.  'Back to the Old House,' 'This Charming Man'  and 'Youve Got Everything Now' are particularly improved upon, but there  isn't a single weak track on the album.
0380788624|2.0|This book is about 50-60% too long.  There are some really good ideas and incredibly well-written parts, but the writing is very inconsistent.  A good editor would've made him keep re-writing until the book as a whole was  a diamond - unfortunately instead we got lots of gems scattered through the  pages.  And hey, some of the gems are as long as 3 paragraphs - but out of  a 1000 page book? <br />Worth reading if you've got lots of time to kill and  don't mind reading so-so prose for long stretches of pages while waiting  for the next gem to come along, but he is so clearly capable of so much  better that it seems a shame to support half-baked efforts.  Send his  publisher a message and do everyone a favor by making NS do his best in the  future.  Borrow it from a library...
6305609721|5.0|Leonard Nimoy lent his genious talent in directing this truly epic and succesful film in the Star Trek movie series and a favorite period among the fans of the almost 35 year old franchise and even among the people who  saw it that weren't fans love it , it is as much everything that Star Trek  it self is making you laugh while at the same time being emotional and  serious and the one thing that is most famous about Star Trek old friends ,  that we know so well back together for another big<br />journey and this on is  no acception as it proves to be there most challenging of this gallant  crew.<br />  The federation is in complete chaos as a sudden unanswerable  probe that they seemingly can't stop or answer is threatning the entire  world and draining it dry , the answer lies with the crew to try and find a  solution to answer this probe.They find the answer in the probes language  they figure out that the probe can be answerd by the sounds of Humpback  whales but in there time period the whales have been extinct for a very  long time ,  Spock suggest that the answer would be to travel  into the  past to 20th century and attemt to find Humback whales but when they do the  surrounding prove to be even more challenging to them then  mission itself  as they confront punk rockers  bus fare and exact change and pizza they  seemingly confront these things in a way that Leonard Nimoy does that makes  you laugh because they never know whats going to happen in this time and  there reactions are so rediculous that you wanna crack up.<br />   The answer  lies in finding these whales with a  fiery female marine biologist who  cares for the whales very deeply and distrusts the Admiral but when she  discovers that the whales have been shipped out to take there chances on  there own she askes for the Admirals help in getting the whales to a safe  place so they will never be in danger but there journey of finding them and  getting them back safely will prove to be far more difficult than they  could ever imagined.<br />    For any Star Trek fan this is the coolest Star  Trek DVD it shows you a feturette in the making of this truly incredible  masterpeice its a must have for any Star Trek fan and an incredible  legendary Star Trek film.
B00003XACV|5.0|One word, folks - Wow. I looked for this CD in stores with no luck, but finally broke down and bought it on Amazon. Needless to say, it's been without regret.<br />I think anyone who enjoyed the film will love it. And if  you hated the film- you'll like it. There is something so powerful behind  each note of Newman's score that blends beautifully with the film, yet  stands alone as a masterpiece in it's own right. This is one of those CD's  that's appreciated most when you put on the headphones, close your eyes and  let it all sink in.<br />Higlights include the moving &quot;Power of  Denial&quot;  and my personal favorite, &quot;Walk home&quot;.<br />I HIGHLY  recommed this CD to anyone who appreciates well written, beautiful music.
6305350205|1.0|A pitiful rediculous directorial debut of Shatner and if anything he should have learned from Leonard.This pathetic excuse for a Star  Trek movie is purely Shatners fult if he would have let Nimoy direct this could  have been a  great film instead it's a movie that makes no sense and it's  awful specal effects because  there's no sign of Industreal Light and Magic  in stead the specal effects look generric and horridly done, and to add to  all of this there is no magic that the Star Trek fans come to  expect and  the film is so quickly put together that it comes out so lackluster that  you feel  like your watching a sitcom instead of a movie.<br />  On a baron  planet Nemisis 3 in the nutral zone a rouge Vulcan name Zybach is obsessed  into finding the answer of God in the universe or in  his words Shakaree he  seemingly thinks that answer lies in the center of the universe he needs a  , starship.Mean while the crew is on shore leave at Yosimite Park Kirk  climbs rocks as the crew bumble around to figure out why hes being so  stupid.It leads into Spock saving his life and a bad attempt at Row Row  Your Boat until in the middle of the night a shuttle awakes them with Uhura  telling them that theres an incident on Nemisis 3 , they go back to a  virtual pile of junk as there ship  is being slowly refited.<br />   They lead  an away team down to save prisoners that are being held for control of the  enterprise  for Zybachs misson.It turns into sabotage when Zybach seemingly  turns the crew into prisoners and Spock who seemingly Zybachs half brother  must find a way to choose between his freinds and his brother obsessed on  his misson he continues his  misson with Kirk just watching the movie turns   bad to horrible when we finally see the unimpressive specal effects the  end is very hard to watch it's just a terrible excuse for a movie nothing  was done right and the worst movie in the hole Star Trek movie series  pathetic very.<br />     If you want to collect all of them that may be the  only reason why you get this DVD but if you can avoid this one at all costs  it's just a disgrace.
B00000IQBM|5.0|Being a teen automatically makes me only like new movies-right? WRONG! This movie is clear evidence. The plot is believable and unbelievably scary. Which, in my opinion, makes it MUCH more scary than The Haunting or  even Chucky. You never know whats around the corner, in one case two dead  twins chopped up years ago by their father.This movie is twisted and keeps  you up nights on end. It introduces new stuff constanly keeping your mind  whirrling and wondering. Rent it if not buy it. I recommend it for anyone  over 13, but only if they're into scary movies. Hope this helps.
0679720200|4.0|When I first picked up the novel as a piece of school equipment I thougth that it would be completely boring, yet when i got home i started to read it and began realising that this was an original masterpiece. The first  line,&quot;Mother died today&quot; instinctivally shows the abnormalities  that this charachter &quot;Meursault&quot; matches up to. Then immediately  i realsied the isolation and alienation that he was suffering. This novel  is a must read, basically because it has issues and values that would never  cross ones mind until they are in a situation where they are alone and are  being judged immoraly. This novel is fantastic, it offers analyzers with a  bowl of chocolate with a cherry on top, and book worms who just love to  read opinionative writing, a chance to understand existentialism. It is  obvious that Camus was involved in existentialism, and maybe the book was  all symbollically referring to Camus life and beliefs.Indications are  easily brought to the readers attention if they are ready to explore an  alientated mind.Overall it was great, i loved it.
0790729636|3.0|The special effects were awsome---the plot not so great.Okay movie, but deffinatly just a renter. Helen Hunt is extremely good in this movie however and if you're a fan it is a must-see. My rating of 3 stars is more  of a personal rating--I am into Horror (hey, I'm a teen!) verse action.
B000009ED0|4.0|A decent CD.  I'm not that big of a rap fan.  In fact, I pretty much hate rap.  However, this album is close enough to rock that I like it.  &quot;Wasting Time&quot; is my favorite song on this CD, but  &quot;Bawitdaba,&quot; &quot;Cowboy,&quot; &quot;I Am the Bullgod,&quot;  and &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot; are also pretty good.  For all you WCW  fans out there, I still think &quot;Cowboy&quot; sounds like Jeff Jarret's  entrance music.
630575067X|5.0|For those of you out there who are not so hypocritical of a movie with a  difference, The Phantom Menace is for you.  I found that the performances  by all actors were excellent, especially Natalie Portman who plays Queen  Amidala/ Padme`. Imagine having to play two different characters in the  same movie!<br />As for those who thought that Epsiode I was a load of  rubbish, I think that perhaps you should stick to romantic comedies, not  science fiction movies like this one.<br />Once again, I thought that this  movie (and the book) was absolutely well done in every way. I find that  every time I watch it, I see something new!! An excellent movie for the  young at heart or for the oringinal Star Wars fans. May The Force Be With  You!!!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Well, what can I say? Here is one of the biggest teen phenomenons to hit the music industry with a better follow-up to her '98 debut, &quot;...Baby One More Time.&quot; One can tell from the get-go that Spears has  incorporated a funkier, more aggressive sound this time around. While she  worked once again with hitmaker Max Martin and Co., she went to another  level working with the &quot;R&amp;B producer of the moment&quot; Rodney  Jerkins on the remake of the Rolling Stones' classic, &quot;(I Can't Get  No) Satisfaction,&quot; and surprisingly it works well for the new  generation. The title track is not as strong as her first hit,  &quot;...Baby One More Time,&quot; although it sounds very similar, but it  does make an impact. The ballads also hit hard: &quot;Don't Let Me Be The  Last To Know,&quot; is likely the best ballad in this album, showcasing  Britney's collaboration with John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange (Shania Twain,  Celine Dion, etc.). If you're into what I like to call &quot;Heavy Pop  Music,&quot; which is very aggressive but fun at the same time, then this  album will deliver it time and time again...

0140277447|5.0|The content of this book is very respectable. In fact, the reality of the Nanking Holocaust was more brutal and diabolic than the crafty lies that the Japanese emperor complex is trying to make up, and now the press tends  to blind the majority of Japanese who are totally ignorant of war.

They  always need your deep understanding, and I hope you will see peace is  priceless. I pray that all suffering souls of the holocaust will be safe  now.

0790729342|5.0|The second of the Mad Max series, the  Road Warrior(Mad Max 2 in Australia) takes place months after the events of the first movie, and finds Max(Mel Gibson) rogue in a world nearing a post nuclear age. Roving  biker gangs, looking more like a twist between hell's angels, bad WWF  wrestlers, and barbarian warriors, terrorize a small oil community, hoping  to gain the fuel which has become more valuable than gold. Max helps the  fledging group, only more for himself than anyone else. This is a high  powered movie, incorporating some of best stunts and car chase sequences in  the series. Superb.

B0000025VU|5.0|I have just written a review of the less impressive 1970 'New Morning' and drifted onto the reviews of this album and must say that as a 28 yr old, 'Infidels' was the first Dylan album I bought in relatively real time , all  the classics having already  been out 20+ years by the time I got them.I  love this album because for me it was the soundtrack to my late teens  rebellious phase ! I often reflect on the fact that Dire Straits and Bruce  Springsteen released 'Brothers in Arms' and 'Born in the USA' respectively  a year after this album came out..To me this album while having no public  recognition as such, is better than the other two albums. Furthermore this  is the only Dylan album I could get friends to listen to and really like  ...
B000001Y5D|4.0|I admit the smash hit single &quot;What's up&quot; drew me into this bay area female band eight years ago but all the songs are worth heavy rotation in my cd player. Linda Perry's lead vocals are raw and soul-dipped rock.  Her standout ballard &quot;morphine and chocolate&quot; alludes to what  could of been a strong rock career had the band not questionaly broken up.  Although the songs are great the band should of given themselves more  credit and hung out because they were destined to be superstars not a  one-hit wonder!
1572522232|4.0|WOW. &quot;Suspiria,&quot; undoubtedly one of the truly scary movies ever made (and this is coming from a devoted Horror Movie fan), and also an important artistic moment for the Italian maestro himself. Trying to pick  the most unsettling scene in this is like trying to pick the goriest  slasher movie of the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; saga (you try it). The  blind man and his dog; of course the opening double murder; the room of  barb wire...For me, the creepiest scene is the one in which Suzy is walking  down the hallway and the cook and little boy just stare (and stare...and  stare...) with Goblin's incredibly unsettling score pulsing in the  background kept me up for a while. Worth seeing, for sure.
B0000203Y5|5.0|This video is absolutely excellent, heartmoving, and educating.  The artists exhibit the deep well of experience they have as individuals who practice their art for the love it.  Their coming together for concerts in  New York was a movie in itself.  They are master muscians and vocalists who  bring their own lives to the audience in their performances.  As for the  rythyms, they are the definition of Afro-Cuban.  I was prompted by this  video to purchase the cd and the cds of individual artists Ruben Gonzales  and Ibrahim Ferrer.  I highly recommend all to your customers.
0060196122|3.0|Paulo Coehlo is an inspirational writer in every sense.  His masterpiece, The Alchemist, was a simple fable which spoke to millions around the world, and for many, changed their lives.<br />With 'Veronika Decides To Die', Coehlo  has written a slight volume about suicide and depression.  One assumes that  he is again trying to provide a sympathetic and supportive understanding to  those who have doubted the value of living and have contemplated or even  made an attempt at taking their own lives.  Coehlo has in fact suffered  this way and therefore writes from some experience.<br />I approached this  book expecting to be treated to Coehlo's inspirational words,'life is worth  living' type stuff. This of course is what he is attempting to write but  sadly I didn't feel all that inspired to live each day to the fullest  anymore than I usually do.  The inspiration here is flat and banal and  frankly quite uncovincing.  It is the chraracters darker, more depressive  thoughts that ring most true in this story and made it a very different  book.  For me a slightly depressing story that gave me few real insights.
B0000019PA|5.0|Listening to this CD is like falling down Alice's rabbit hole; Things are strangely famillar, but twisted, skewed and out-of-order. It's one of the few albums I've ever heard to really capture the wide-eyed wonderment of  childhood adventure. The truly great thing about this record (and the  quality that elevates far above &quot;on avery island&quot;) is its  accesibility. I've heard NMH's music called &quot;challenging&quot;  &quot;difficult&quot; &quot;abstract&quot;... sure, it's all these things,  but conveniently packed into a sweet, pop-flavored pill that's easy to  swallow. It's one of the rare albums that works on many levels... a first  listen reveals some cool, catchy melodies... then you notice the ecclectic  instrumentation, next, buried sounds, harmonies, countermelodies...  finally, you start to really think about the lyrics, which at times, are  stone-cold brilliant. Odd, damaged, and twisted, but brilliant. You really  have the sense of entering a new world of sound and sensation. <br />Perfect  soundtrack for: reading Weiner, Kafka or Proust... or C.S Lewis, Lewis  Carol, or Tolkein... or for doing the laundry, or lifting weights, or  combing your hair or... well... just day-dreaming.<br />Weird, warped and  wonderful music that will appeal to listners of Palace, Tom Waits, Giant  Sand, Mercury Rev, or anyone with a slightly tilted sense of sound (and  humour).
B00000JPYQ|5.0|I can only remember these songs from yesterday. Listening to this brought back great times... Back when UFO was popular I can remember cruising in my Hot Rod and on a beautiful Hot summer night cranking your Pioneer to listen  to such soulful tunes...This CD has everything to offer a die hard UFO fan  and alot more to anyone venturing back to a time when things weren't so  difficult, an innocence lost..... Lights Out Fans
B00000FCBC|4.0|... especially considering that the first disc is all 'New' Metallica, and the second disc is all 'Old' Metallica.  While many of the old school fans who have been waiting for this since the Black album will immediatley flock  to disc 2 and never look back (granted, it's excellent), there's plenty to  like on disc 1, too.<br />  Most notably, Metallica has finally found their  footing in their new mid-tempoed rock sound, ironically, through other  people's efforts.  They pull off Sabbath just as easily as the Misfits just  as easily as Bob Seger, and even Lynyrd Skynyrd (featuring LS band members  in Tuesday's Gone).  The first disc is fairly uneven but the highlights  (Turn the Page, Mercyful Fate, Tuesday's Gone, Sabbra Cadabbra, Whiskey in  the Jar) stand out as some of late-era Metallica's best.  There's plenty  more to like on that disc, as well.<br />  Disc 2 is a collection of the  oft-bootlegged early covers that Metallica has been doing since 1981, and  if old, raw, epic, trashing Metallica is what you want, it will suit you  perfectly.  The middle-section is the highlight, with Breadfan, Am I Evil?,  Prince, and Stone Cold Crazy standing out amongst the bunch.<br />  Garage  Inc. will satisfy just about any Metallica follower out there, early-day  lover or late-era.  For a 2-disc, long compilation, it's focused and  Metallica actually sounds like it's having some fun for the first time in  awhile.
B00000IMTH|4.0|\\"Long Live Rock and Roll\\" is Ritchie Blackmore's third post-Deep Purple album.  Though Rainbow was started and controlled by Blackmore, this album is also and equally representative of singer/songwriter Ronnie James Dio's  talents, and of the special magic that the two of them create together.  The album is also remarkable for Cozy Powell's top notch drumming.  Unfortunately, bassist Bob Daisley and keyboardist David Stone make only  solid, but uninteresting contributions, sacrificing the feeling of five  equally creative musicians working together, which Deep Purple achieved.  If judged against the whole spectrum of rock, \\"Long Live Rock and Roll\\" is  an utterly impressive, first rate album, but any fan of Blackmore or Dio  could infer that without ever hearing the album.  Therefore I am judging  this album against Blackmore and Dio's bodies of work, and the high  standards they set for themselves.  In terms of songwriting the album  is mostly mediocre, with songs that stick in the listener's head far  shorter than most Blackmore or Dio recording before or since.  The best way  to describe songs like \\"L.A. Connection&quot; or  \\"Subtle/The Shed\\" is as  enjoyable, but unremarkable.  Even the album-opening title track, with it's  sing-along chorus, is somehow to safe.  Fortunately three utterly amazing  songs come to the rescue of this album.  The beautiful, modal melody and  powerful riffing of \\"The Gates of Babylon&quot; perks the listener's ears  up at the close of the first side.  Immediately, the second side opens with  the barnstorming \\"Kill the King,\\" featuring a hair-raising intro and one of  Blackmore's most intense solos ever.  Finally, the album finishes with  \\"Rainbow Eyes,\\" a feather-light, tear-inspiring ballad which benefits  greatly from a tasteful string arrangement.  The placement of these three  gems at the end of side one, and at the opening and closing of side two,  makes the album seem much more impressive than if they were clumped  together at the beginning or end of the album.  Despite hit and miss  songwriting, the consistently stellar performances by Blackmore, Dio, and  Powell make even the least memorable songs respectable.  Of note are the  tasteful, emotive solos which Blackmore turns in on every song, and Dio's  powerful use of his clean vocals, which soon became tinged by growling  after he joined Black Sabbath and became a \\"metal\\" singer, rather than just  an unlabeled rock singer.  \\"Long Live Rock and Roll\\" is far from a  perfect album, but it still greatly outshines most rock albums, and is a  must have for Blackmore and Dio fans.
B000002H97|4.0|After finishing their travel down the road of progressive epic-speed metal, Metallica finally decides to tighten things up a bit and go commercial.  Suprisingly, it works, and it works well here.  <br />  The Black  album is not a Metallica classic.  The Black album is not a concept album.   The Black album is a collection of radio-ready, catchy SONGS, that simplify  the structures, slow down the tempo, and accentuate the production.  But  again, it works here.  The first half of this album is flawless, and the  second half, while it does contain a few filler songs, is also executed  well.  <br />  Everyone knows the numerous hit singles from the album, Enter  Sandman, Sad but True, the Unforgiven, Wherever I may Roam, Nothing Else  Matters, Don't Tread on Me, Of Wolf and Man, etc etc.  This is why the  Black album will have it's place in history, not because it's better than  Metallica's previous efforts (and it isn't), but because it brought heavy  metal to a mainstream audience for the first time.  The songs are catchy,  there's little to no social commentary here, either.  It's just a tight  batch of good songs.<br />  Highlights are The Unforgiven, Nothing Else  Matters, and My Friend of Misery, songs that still show that Metallica can  push their boundries, even within their new commercialized format.  To  prove that they can still play speed, Holier than Thou makes it's presence  felt.  And Enter Sandman and Wherever I May Roam remain two of their most  well-known songs.<br />  The Black album wasn't influential or superior.  But  it was good enough to accomplish everything it set out to do.  And that  alone is worth the price of admission.  It's a toss between this album or  Master of Puppets as to which a new fan should buy first.  This usually  wins.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney's second album, &quot;Oops!...I Did it Again&quot;, superseeds her first in many ways. I was a little leery about buying the album, but once I heard the title track and listened to clips of her other songs on the  internet, the songs were all stuck in my head! Her thrashy new style shows  a definite maturation of her capabilities as a pop songstress. Needless to  say, I was very impressed with the album.         &quot;Stronger&quot;  seems to come through as an independece anthem. &quot;Don't Go Knockin' On  My Door&quot; follows behind as a continuation of &quot;Stronger&quot;. Her  rejuvenation of The Rolling Stone's Classic, &quot;(I Can't Get No)  Satisfaction, is a sassy twist. The dialogue at the beginning kind of takes  away from the song, but the song itself is catchy. One of my favorite songs  on the album is &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;. This song is  so beautiful and really demonstrates her singing capabilites well. Shania  Twain and Mutt Lange really wrote a beautiful song, and Britney does her  best to make it her own. My favorite song on this album is, &quot;What U  See (Is What U Get)&quot;. Don't ask me why....I just played it over and  over (listening to it right now) and I love it! &quot;Lucky&quot; is just  as catchy...the dialog puts an interesting twist on the song, and leaves us  wondering, &quot;Is this the way Britney feels inside?&quot; The album  seems to take a slight slope from there...all the songs towards the end  appear to be slow-tempoed. I think, &quot;Where Are You Now&quot; is a  beautiful song and I enjoy it as well. Don't get me wrong... all of the  songs on the album are awesome. &quot;One Kiss From You&quot; and  &quot;Can't Make You Love Me&quot; are the exceptions where Britney makes  one last attempt to pump things up before, &quot;When Your Eyes Say  It&quot; begins to mellow out the album so that &quot;Dear Diary&quot; can  finish it out perfectly.       If you are a Britney fan, I definitely  recommend purchasing this album...it is a definite improvement on Britney's  part as well as an ego-booster to any one of her fans!
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride The Lightning could almost be called a transitional album if it wasn't so darn accomplished in every facet.  The rapid-fire riffing and barking vocals are here, along with the overdriven backbeat, from Kill em  All, but here, Metallica takes a very ambitious direction, giving 'Ride the  Lightning' an overall theme, and complicated song structures that can keep  the listener interested even through 6-minute plus epics.<br />  They make no  pretensions as to what this album is going to be.  The opening track, Fight  fire With Fire, starts off with a slow classical guitar intro and  immediatley kicks into an ultra-fast, 4 minutes of Nucular-war death.  The  title track, amongst numerous (albiet slight) tempo shifts, examines the  Chair from the prisioner's point of view.  For Whom The Bell Tolls, one of  Metallica's best songs, narrates trench warfare, and another one of  Metallica's early high-watermarks, Fade to Black, is a thought-provoking,  slow-bleeding song about suicide.<br />  The second half of the album is  equally as hard-hitting, with 'Trapped Under Ice' bringing the speed back.   Escape almost sounds pop-rockish at times, and Creeping Death is another  storytelling epic.  The album closes with Metallica's best instrumental  recording, The Call of Ktulu. (Which is supposed to be a musical, thematic  journey to hell)  Clocking in at over 8 minutes, the instrumental never  loses interest for a second, beginning with a paranoid, creepy guitar intro  and tipping into a torrent of riffs and skin pounding, building upon itself  towards the album's ultimate conclusion.<br />  Ride the Lightning is an  extremely ambitious follow-up to Kill em All, and Metallica's reach never  exceeds their hands.  Master of Puppets, their follow-up to this, would  border on utter perfection, but Ride the Lightning is right on it's heels.
6305776326|4.0|I saw this movie because everyone in my class was seeing it. I had no interest in seeing it myself. I LOVED it. It was so original and it had such good acting by Molly Shannon. The &quot;Tree Scean&quot; was so funny-  and an immediate classic, it will be shown forever as an example of  wonderful comedy!
B000002H33|5.0|... that's a matter of opinion.  The fact is, Metallica, nor any other metal band, has ever released a more focused, accomplished effort as Master of Puppets.  <br />  Metallica came into it's own with this release, which  would unfortunatley be their last with Cliff Burton on bass.  Continuing in  the same path Ride the Lightning blazed, yet constantly building and  improving upon it, MoP is superior to it's extremely excellent predeccessor  in every aspect.  It's harder, faster, more intelligent, focused, more  complicated, and packs a heck of a punch the entire way through, even the  slower songs, The Thing that Should not Be and Sanitarium, are excellent  and considered among the band's best.<br />  The general theme is examining  methods of control and the abuse of it, from drug lords (the title track)  to the military (Disposable Heroes) to a mental paitent (Sanitarium) and  even a proverbial false-prophet story (Leper Messiah).  There's another  instrumental thrown in for good measure (Orion, featuing great work by  Burton), as well.<br />  Master of Puppets displays everything that made  Metallica great in the first place, and it displays it prominently.  James  Hetfield is becoming a more accomplished vocalist, the guitar attack never  lets up, even when it slows down, the tempo changes and epic, multi-part  song structures border on orchestral at times.  This isn't an album, it's  more of an experience.<br />  If all you've heard of Metallica is post-Black  material, then Master of Puppets should definitley be on your list.   Metallica would continue to grow and experiment, with mixed results, over  the years, but they would never acheive a level of perfection such as this  again.
0792842723|4.0|Goldeneye is one of the better Bond films to come out in a long time.  As with all my favorite Connery ones, Goldeneye has an interesting story, good villians, and tons of action.  The only real problem with this film is that  too much of it is spent introducing Pierce Brosnan as Bond.  He obviously  is a good actor and does a good job and I don't think it is really  neccesary for the script to but so much emphasis on &quot;the new  Bond&quot;. Overall it's still a great movie and way better than any of the  Moore ones.
B000002H6C|5.0|Had Metallica bothered to produce this album, it would've ranked right up there with Master of Puppets.  As 'And Justice for All' stands, it's Metallica's most progressive, ambitious album.  Continuing in the direction  from their two previous albums, the theme here is, obviously, Justice, or  the lack thereof in today's society.  Much of the songwriting was inspiried  by the death of their bassist Cliff Burton, giving it a bitter, tough edge  to offset the poor overall sound of the mix.  <br />  As with all of  Metallica's early material, there's a few bonafide metal classics here yet  the entire album is worthy.  One, Dyers Eve, and the title track are the  most immediate and stand out the most. (perhaps because they're the least  affected by the poor production).  This was Metallica pushing every last  bit of their progressive ambition from themselves, perhaps knowing that a  change in direction was in order, they wanted to clear the slate, a la Led  Zeppelin and Physical Grafitti.  <br />  A couple of the sounds do sound  almost like 'gasp' filler, but the album is almost a concept in itself, so  this can be accepted.  It did give the band it's first taste of mainstream  success with it's first single 'One', gaining heavy MTV support with it's  chilling, provacative video.  Throughout the album, ultra-complicated song  structures abound in just about every effort, keeping even the near  10-minute title track from sounding boring in the least, and elevating  'One' to status of one of Metallica's best songs, perhaps, THE best.<br />   And Justice for All is definitly worth the pickup, standing with the rest  of Metallica's early material as some of the best metal albums out there.   Yes, the production is muddled and dry, but it gives the album almost a  darker feel that is, in fact suitable after the tragedy the band was beset  by.  It's an album that will grow with each subsequent listen.
0792842731|5.0|I haven't really been satisfied with a Bond film since Sean Connery left.  The Roger Moore ones were fairly dumb(Jaws falls in love?) and Timothy Dalton just couldn't get the role right.  i am happy to say the Pierce  Brosnan is the best Bond since Connery and has restored my faith in the  franchise.  Goldeneye was interesting but it was somewhat shakey since  License to Kill had bombed and the producers were nervous.  <br />Tommorow  Never Dies simply lets Bond be Bond and produces one of the most stylish  films in the series.  The plot is fairly interesting and Jonathon Pryce  makes a great villian.  It may not be the most origional film, but Tommorow  Never Dies takes the classic Bond formula and does great things with it.
B000002HRE|3.0|... and we all know what THAT means, right?  A bunch of Load rejects surrounded by a few good songs?  Well, yes.  But this album isn't quite as bad as it comes across.  It's hard to say whether it's better than Load or  not, sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.<br />  A few tracks almost, ALMOST  recall the early days, especially Fuel, Fixxxer, and Prince Charming.   Parts of this album, like Load, (and to a degree, the Black) are  unlistenable jokes, long, boring, and meandering, but for the most part  Re-Load is tighter and more focused than it's older brother.  The  Unforgiven II grows on you with a few listens, despite it's inherent  wierdness, and Low Man's Lyric is a slow-burning song, that unlike most  other slow Metallica songs, actually STAYS slow.  It does work, however.<br />   Re-Load is for you if you liked Load, naturally, because both albums are  virtually interchangeable.  It's not quite the 'return to metal' that it  was trumpeted as, but it's a good effort from a band that continues to find  new ways to rock, albiet with mixed results.
B00000DFRS|5.0|After purchasing her singles from \\"My Love Is Your Love,\\" I have finally bought the album and it was a listenable experience; a breath of fresh air. And I do mean \\"fresh.\\" Whitney Houston's  first  album since \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight,\\" back in 1990 is definitely  what the critics were talking about when it first came out nearly two years  ago. She has gone straight R&B, no doubt about it. I think she's gettin' jiggy wit it on \\"It's Not Right But It's Okay,\\" \\"If I Told  You That,\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hotel.\\" I don't care what anybody  says about \\"When You Believe,\\" her hyped-up duet with Mariah Carey. This track from the movie \\"The Prince Of Egypt\\" shows us  that soulful divas like Mariah and Whitney still got it after all these  years. Missy \\"Misdemeanor\\" Elliot is there for \\"In My  Business\\" and \\"Oh Yes,\\" both songs deal with her spotlight  marriage to Bobby Brown. Two Refugees are there too: Wyclef Jean did the  title cut (which I love the best) and Lauryn Hill uncredited on \\"I Was  Made To Love Him,\\" a remake of Stevie Wonder's \\"I Was Made To Love Her.\\" That is the hidden track on the CD. Babyface is  back as well on \\"When You Believe,\\" \\"Until You Come Back,\\" \\"I Bow Out,\\" and \\"You'll Never Stand  Alone.\\" Eight years between movies and soundtracks, this album is most definitly worth waiting for.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Hey, do you really think britney sings like a baby?  then listen to this great CD, i just bought and heard it, and i'm with an open mouth.... I can't believe is this great!  you really have to listen to it,  REALLY!
B000002KYB|5.0|This is Dire Straits most musically challenging album--and one of the most rewarding.  The lengthy epic story song &quot;Telegraph Road&quot; is the centerpiece and among the best songs ever written by leader Mark Knopfler.  It is followed by the haunting &quot;Private Investigations.&quot;  Then,  just when things threaten to get too dour, along comes a humorous ditty  with the improbable name &quot;Industrial Disease&quot; to lighten things  up a bit.  This is a classic example of rock and roll as mood music.
0671042858|4.0|I have a very biased opinion on Stephen King; I have enjoyed all of his work; and The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is great work.  In general I think SK has a wonderful ability of writing such different tales, whilst managing  to introduce interesting characters, and presenting some chilling horror.  In this book King has continued his mold of the late 90's by delivering a  unique book that is different from any of his other work.  Very few writers  could write a whole book about a young girl lost in the woods, fewer could  keep it interesting for 250 pages and only Stephen King could leave you at  the end wanting more.  This book could have been twice as long, but come to  think of it, so could The Stand!.  Long Live the King.
B000002KLQ|4.0|I own all of Dire Straits's studio albums and I must say that the first side of &quot;Making Movies&quot; (the first three songs) is as good as anything they've ever recorded.  &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; &quot;Romeo  and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Skateway&quot; are all long sweeping sounscapes  with storytelling lyrics to match.  Unfortunately, side two just does not  measure up, the songs being less well written and far less interesting  musically.  Overall it is worth owning, but after a few listens you may  find yourself stopping it halfway through.
B000002KAG|5.0|I came to the Grateful Dead because--well, because of who they are, long before . . . very long before I actually was sober and straight-headed enough to contemplate their music.  By and large I'm a Jerry fan and his  signature guitar-work transporting (lazy hazy summer days in a lawn chair  with a beer under a tree listening the Grateful Dead . . . camping . . .  it's all good!).  This album is grossly underrated because it really does  underscore their popular genius despite their youthful musical limitations.   The songs on this album capture the organ-tinged psychedelia of the  Height-Ashbury scene, but do not totter into overly-indulgent  &quot;jams&quot; that turn many listeners off (only one song does, and its  a pretty good listen anyhow).  Here, too, we get a strong sense of the  Dead's blues roots, and why they let Weir sing.  Early on, at least, Weir's  youthful voice can actually carry a tune!  The album is a good,  head-nodding groove and rivals most of the studio albums that have been  released to date.  While the production and engineering is not top notch  for its day, it really does highlight their talents.  A must for any  serious music collecter for its historical AND musical signficance.  Ultimately, however, the reason why this album deserves high praise is  because it manages to capture a sense of &quot;fun.&quot;  One of the best  recordings of &quot;fun&quot; this century.
B000002L7G|4.0|Because &quot;Brother in Arms&quot; raised Dire Straits into international superstar status, it would be natural for longtime fans like me to hate it.  But I don't because despite its popularity, it is no sellout.  &quot;Money  for Nothing&quot; and its MTV tie-in may have been the most overplayed song  of 1986, but songs like &quot;So Far Away,&quot; &quot;Walk of Life&quot;  and &quot;Why Worry&quot; are among leader MArk Knopfler's best ever.  In  fact, only a couple of draggy songs toward the end keep this album from  obtaining true classic status.  A rare example of artistic and comercial  success going hand-in-hand.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Only at the repeated insistence of my friend A. did I sit down and *really* listen to this album.  I must admit that I regard much contemporary r&amp;b and hip-hop with skepticism because of the same lack  of individuality that is rife in the boy-band repertoire.  Anything with  high praise on a big label (e.g. Columbia)--especially anything that gets  high praise in &quot;awards&quot; shows, must be sub par.  Lauryn Hill  knows this--and sings about it (&quot;Superstar&quot;)--and produces an  album that *she* wanted.  The result is anything but ordinary.  Her voice  is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.  This is pure  soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.  The song,  &quot;To Zion,&quot; merits owning the album alone.  In this tribute to her  son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes  what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.  Simply amazing.
B000002LQQ|3.0|I own ever Dire Straits album and unfortunately have to say that the last is also certainly the least.  The massive success of 1986's &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; album seems to have exhausted leader Mark Knopfler and the  band right along with him.  A few songs like &quot;Calling Elvis&quot; and  &quot;Heavy Fuel&quot; resonate, but little among the rest carry the weight  of any song on their classic albums.  Give Knopfler credit for knowing when  it was time to pack it in instead of keeping the band together solely for  the money.
0345418336|3.0|I'd never really read a &quot;spy&quot; novel before this book, but I'd imagined them to be tense, white-knuckle affairs.  Strangely, I didn't find that at all in this book, although it is largely hailed as the greatest spy  novel ever written.  It is much more of a human drama with a lot of sad  commentary on the psychological and physical torture some people go through  for the sake of their countries.  The plot happened rather gradually, with  Le Carre never giving you enough information to be sure if you were  understanding what was happening in the right light.  The plot itself was  very convoluted and complex, but most of the twists and turns just shuttled  you back and forth between wondering if A was happening or B was happening.   By the end of the book you knew that either plot A or B was going to turn  out to be the truth, and the book could have conceivably ended a chapter or  two early without the final change even necessary.  Le Carre's writing  style is engaging but economical and the book is a surprisingly quick read.   I wouldn't include this on a must-read list, but if you're looking for an  easy read, you might try it.
B000002KK8|5.0|Though unlike their debut album it doesn't contain a classic hit like &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, as an album &quot;Communique&quot; is nearly as good.  Leader Mark Knopfler shows no evidence of a sophomore slump in  either his songwriting or his superb guitar playing.  The best tracks are  the threatening &quot;Where Do You Think You're Going?&quot; the superb  &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West,&quot; and the playful songs &quot;Lady  Writer&quot; and &quot;Angel of Mercy.&quot;  There is not a bad tune on  the whole album and that makes it well worth owning.
B00004SCX6|1.0|This is not good.  Oops sounds like Baby one more time. Hello!  Be original. I am a R&amp;B fan and I do not think many R&amp;B people will buy this bubble gum album.  Britney should work on her vocals.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Normally I buy a cd knowing I am going to skip tracks regularly, but this time I could listen to the whole cd through and that really surprised me.   Oops is better than Baby, her old cd, which I felt only had a couple of  good songs.  Here, there's a lot to more to like.  The songs really are  catchy.  My review is more like 4.5 stars.  Didn't really like all the  talking inbetween, but overall a very good cd.
6305603847|1.0|One of my friends told me after I saw this movie, &quot;You need to have the right frame of mind to enjoy this movie -- and that frame of mind is to be completely stoned on drugs.&quot;<br />This was the absolute WORST movie I  have ever seen. The only reason why I sat through the whole thing and  didn't leave in disgust right away was because I kept thinking to myself,  &quot;Gosh, they will have to end this nonsense soon and get on with the  *real* movie, right?&quot;<br />Except it never did! The total inanity just  went on, and on, and on... until the movie ended!
0783225792|5.0|If you love the mafia and you love the mafia's presence in Las Vegas, then check this three hour movie out.  The acting by DeNiro and Pesci are second to none in this movie.  Incredible opening and closing of the movie about  how Vegas is now compared to when it began.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|I have owned the original U.K video version of this classic horror gore flick for years and thought that it was completely uncut...How wrong can I be!  This unrated DVD version has loads more blood 'n' guts mayhem and with  the added bonus of behind the scenes footage and Dolby 5.1 soundtrack make  it a must purchase for any serious horror fan. How Sam Raimi &amp; crew  made such a top notch film on such a tight budget is beyond me but I am  glad they did! The atmosphere is brilliant, the acting suitable  overpowering and the special effects are excellent (not a patch on modern  day CGI but as stomach churning as you could ever want). All in all a must  buy and remember...don't go into the woods alone...especially if you are a  lad!
0790742780|5.0|Falling Down is a movie that I would recommend to anyone who wants to watch a movie about a  guy who snaps in Los Angeles (it beats freeway chases).  He goes on a rampage through the southland to see his daughter's  birthday in Santa Monica.  Michael Douglas and Robert Duval give excellent  performances in the movie.
0140283587|5.0|This book was a great read. I bought it at St. Pancras Stationin London and got so caught up in it I missed my train -- twice. It'slaugh-out-loud funny and a poke in the eye for all those backpackers wrapped up in their own self-importance as they venture from suburbia to the far-flung corners of the world to try and find themselves. As someone who has lived as a settler in Africa all my life, this book was a great satire on some of the objectionalble people from Europe and the States who believe they know everything about Africa because they have spent a couple of months there.  Don't get me wrong some are very nice people -- others are certainly not -- but anyone who claims they understand Africa after a few months on the tourist trail (which they think is the real Africa because only backpackers go on it) is delusional. I have lived in Africa for 30 years and I do not understand it. Brilliant passage when the main character meets a Reuters journalist which goes right to the heart of Sutcliffe's message. A must read.
B000020617|2.0|If you'd like to get a Foo Fighters disc, get &quot;Colour and the Shape&quot; - one of the best discs of the 90s. Unfortunately there isn't a song on their latest disc that's as good as anything on &quot;Colour.&quot;  This late 1999 release got one play on my CD player, and then was put into  the CD rack, afterwhich I went back to listening to &quot;Everlong,&quot;  &quot;My Hero,&quot; and the remainder of &quot;Colour.&quot; This is not a  terrible disc, just not great.
B000002LFZ|5.0|This is the best c/d ever!
0782008372|1.0|I am a huge Highlander fan and this DVD is terrible.  I have never seen a DVD with such poor video quality. I have it on VHS which is the only way to go.  The producers of Highlander did a diservice to fans by releasing an  extremely sub-par version on DVD.  Great movie, bad presentation.  Save  your money!
0805062971|5.0|This is a very original work of literature.  If you see the movie first, you will notice that the film follows the book very closely.  I see them as nearly equals.  If you hate one, don't expect to like the other since they  are so similar.  The plot is very original, even though only a small  portion of it deals of a fight club.  The majority of the book is about  finding the meaning of life and dealing with the struggles you encounter in  life.  The characters see real and it's hard to put this book down once you  start.  A masterpiece of literature that fans of Bret Easton Ellis and  Patrick McCabe will enjoy.
0553062182|5.0|My husband bought this book for me because he'd read about it and thought that I might be what Aron terms a &quot;highly sensitive person&quot; (HSP).  Like many of the other reviewers here, I was amazed to discover  that Aron described, and explained, many of my own traits and experiences:  sensitivity to noise and dislike of hubbub (strong characteristics of  American culture); stress and fatigue from brief and ordinary, though  intense to me, social interactions; the ability to sense other people's  moods and what is going on below surface interactions more so than others  seem to; and the feeling of being the only one who experiences the world as  I do.  Aron's study is grounded in solid research and persuasive scientific  explanations, as well as in her personal experiences and those of numerous  subjects she interviewd. This is a path-breaking book that not only  validates the experiences of sensitive people but gives specific,  thoughtful advice for understanding ourselves, coping in the world (in a  variety of situations, including one's job), and making the most of our  senstivity.  I suspect that the opinionated rants found among some of these  reviews are from non-HSPs who don't get it, because HSPs are by nature more  thoughtful (rather than boorish and angry) and would offer well-considered,  fair assessments of the book.  Thank you, Dr. Aron, for giving us this  wonderful book.
B00003CWN2|5.0|Hilary Swank gives a flawless portrayal of Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon in this masterpiece.  This film is exceptionally well made and very powerful. The film contains frequent scenes of raw brutality and a very graphic rape  scene.  The acting is near perfect (expecially by Swank and Chloe Sevigny).   This film is at times hard to watch, but it is very well made.
B000003S5H|5.0|This is one of the most amazing albums of the year.  My second favorite album behind Ok Computer...
B00004TJK2|5.0|A great movie about diving.  Wonderfully strange characters.  The Andes,  Italy, New York and Greece.  A masterpiece.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I'm rather new to the Britney craze.  I didn't buy her first album though I did like &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;.  I thought I'd give this one a try and I'm glad I did.  While I could have done  without the 'conversational' interludes that segue certain songs together,  I think musically - as far as dance pop is concerned - the album is  terrific.  I don't think there's a single weak or &quot;filler&quot; song  on the album.<br />My favorites - &quot;Oops...&quot;,  &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, &quot;One Kiss From You&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;,  and &quot;Where Are You Now&quot;.<br />Britney's follow-up lives up to the  hype.  It's great fun.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie was awesome! It had great special effects and the storyline was great! Imagine the world we live in being just a matrix! It's mind boggling and since I love computers this movie was the best. If the end was any  indication, I can't wait for the next one to come out. I'll be the first  one in line. <br />If you haven't seen this movie, you better rent it tonight,  or better yet buy it! You'll want to watch this one over and over. And  every time, you pick up new things! <br />I loved watching the behind the  scenes that comes with the DVD version. It's pretty neat to watch how they  created all those amazing scenes.<br />Get it today, and you won't regret it!
0783114222|5.0|This is, by far, the most awe-inspiring and breathtaking video I have ever owned. &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; chronicles America's determination, pride and dedication of sending a man 250,000 miles to the surface of moon. HBO, Tom Hanks, Andrew Chaiken and a cast and crew of so many others, have put together a 12hr miniseries, broken into one hour segments that tells and visually shows you the hard work and bravery of the astronauts, engineers, NASA administrators, and even politians like President Kennedy, who have struggled to put the smartest men in the world onto the face of the moon and safely back to earth before the end of the decade. You will get to know, intimately, each astronaut, the wives of these brave men, and the men and women behind the works of the most powerful and sophisticated engineering of the time. After watching this, I am sure you will have a tear-jerking appreciation of this painstakingly accomplishment and give praise to all the customer reviewers who have given this no less than FIVE STARS. On a scale from 1 to 10, I give it an eleven(11).
B00004SCX6|4.0|I got this CD the day it came out 'cause I am a fan of Mrs. Spears and I wasn't disapointed! The album is harder and edgier than her debut and comes across alot more mature. Of course there is the hit single 'Oops!...I Did  It Again' which is very much like '...Baby One More Time' in structure but  recreates the same mood and feeling. Britney is great at coveying mood  through music and it shows on this CD. 'Stronger' is heavy but works  somehow, the choir in the background focuses Britney's sweet voice on the  chorus and we see simplicity here rather than vocal gymnastics (Christina  Aguilera). 'Don't Go Knockin' On My Door' is great, very much like a  Destiny's Child or new 'NSync song. 'What U See Is (What You Get)' is a  great song, complete attitude and mood again. 'Lucky' is my favorite 'cause  it has  a kind of '50's beat to it that groves. 'One Kiss From You', 'Can't  Make You Love Me' and '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' are great too. The  'Mutt' Lange and Shania Twain written 'Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know' is  beautiful, though it's strange to see a country dou's song appear on this  album, but it works! Oddly enough the album works, I'm sure it will break  records as it is bound to do because it a great POP record, fun and  pratical. Four out of Five. Check out 'Where Are You Now' too.
B000000W6R|5.0|Pisces is a great selection of songs. each of them compliments the next.<br />Soothe - is acoustic and dreamy. i like how the pumpkins open this album on a soft note.<br />Frail &amp; Bedazzled- is a customary pumpkins  rocker, complete with the metal crunch.<br />Plume - is really wierd. it  reminds me of shoegazer pop, because the guitars are so loud yet the beat  is so slow.<br />Whir - i love these one-named titles. whir is happy, and very  pretty.<br />Blew away. a song from the iha files. it's whispered and  dreamy.<br />Pissant - is one of my favorite songs on the album. loud,  mindless fun, with the teenage angst we all love so much.<br />Hello Kitty Kat  - same as before, except harsher.<br />Obscured - is a bloody beautiful song.  this might be my favorite song on the album.<br />Landslide - a nice fleetwood  mac cover.<br />starla - is a classic smashing pumpkins epic. it runs over 10  minutes long, but is always interesting.<br />Blue - Is fun, and kinda wierd.  i like this song a lot.<br />a girl named sandoz - i don't know who wrote  this, but i know it's a cover song.<br />La Dolly Vita - is my favorite sp  song, period.<br />spaced - is a nice way to end the album. on a soft not  again.
6305265488|4.0|I didn't know what this movie would be like - I expected, from the cover, a lot of romance - but it was actually really good (except for a few cuss words)! I liked how Danielle got back at Marguerite, her evil stepsister  (the other stepsister, Jacqueline, was &quot;good&quot;), whereas in other  movies the poor protagonist just stood there helpless. <br />There were also  more funny parts in it than you would think. Overall, Ever After was one of  those &quot;It's-better-than-I-thought-it-would-be&quot; films.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Leave it to Britney to come up with a brilliant follow-up to &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;.I highly recommend buying &quot;Oops! ..I Did It Again&quot;cause of the great songs,like  &quot;Lucky&quot;,&quot;Oops! ..&quot;and the re-make of the Rolling  Stones&quot;Satisfaction&quot;Keep doing it Britney!
6305265488|5.0|I am slightly biased about this movie as my favorite actress is Drew Barrymore but she really shines in this movie. She portrays her character with every emotion in human nature and brings life to the story. I felt  like I was there watching what was going on instead of just watching the  screen. Drew just has a sparkle to her that she carries to all her  characters and this one is no exception. From shy to bold and courageous,  Danielle is the heroine of all heroines. She overcomes all her obstacles to  capture the heart of the prince like no other. A fairytale romance is  exactly what this is and one that makes you long for fantasy over  real-life.
0440219078|4.0|The story takes place in a perfect community, but what the main character, Jonas, came to find out was that it wasn't perfect at all.  The community wasn't allowed the memories that I would consider so common that I wouldn't even give them a second thought, memories like the distinction between  colors and what snow is.  I think the story makes you think about what a  perfect world could possibly be like, without pain and suffering, but some  of the things the people in the community were denied I couldn't imagine  living without.

B0000203YT|5.0|This was a beautiful romance. Gweneth and Joseph were just perfect together. I don't think it could've been done with any other actord. They had a chemistry that was just right for this movie. Viola and Will  definitely rank in the top 10 couples in movie history. They were just  wonderful and you can easily get caught up in their story and their  passion. What they had for each other is something only found on screen and  that is what captures audiences everywhere.<br />If you haven't seen this  movie, you must. Even if you don't know anything about Shakespeare, the  romance itself will keep you in the seat till the end.
0553573403|5.0|I came off of rereading Jordan's books for the second time, and was certain that I'd never read another fantasy book (when WILL that thing END?) for as long as I lived.  But this one was recommended to me by a  friend with the words &quot;You've never read anything like it.  I  swear.&quot; Well, he was right, because I hadn't.  It moves at a good pace  - instead of three chapters saying &quot;The river was blue, they crossed  it at 8 pm, nothing happened, but let me tell you ALL about it...&quot;  there was the amazing sentence &quot;They crossed the river&quot; - and the  characters speak like normal people, with no thee's and thou's used  improperly, with the kind of bawdy language one doesn't usually see a  fantasy novel.  You know, the actual words used by people who lived during  the time of serfs. The classes are well defined, not by skill or wealth  like most books, but by birth, and the place of women in the old society is  well represented, no matter how much power they hold behind the  scenes.<br />While the book does borrow heavily from a few English and  Scottish legends...well, who doesn't?  Definitely a good read, and  mercifully short!  Check out the second book, as well.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Let me preface that I look forward to a PJ album every two years to reaffirm my belief in rock and roll.  They haven't ever failed.....until now.  Listening to this album made me think the band needed to take 4-5  years off, not do side projects, and use their best ideas for the next  record.  I was so depressed that I pulled out all my PJ cds(b-sides too)  and started ranking songs.  I got to 30 something before I could even think  about putting something from Binaural on the list.  There are some solid  songs but nothing that jumps out at you.  Experimental(meaning atypical of  the PJ sound) songs that have worked really well in the past(Spin the Black  Circle, Do the Evolution come to mind) fail miserably here(Evacuation,  Grievance).  Overall this album is a huge disappointment when judged  against their former body of work.  Don't know how someone could give this  album five stars.  Seems extremely optimistic and forgiving at best.   Patently stupid at the worst.

0802136834|5.0|I've read most of the biographies of Anne Boleyn and this is the best one. Go ahead and read the other reviews - I don't need to elaborate, myself, because everyone else already has.
0800136586|5.0|For as long as I can remember, Annie has always been my favorite movie. When I was a little girl and it was playing in the theaters, I must have seen that movie at least 20 times. Even now I love watching this movie. I  will pass it on to my daughter and her daughter. It is a little girl's  wonderland, to imagine the fancy world that Annie gets drawn into when she  goes to live with Daddy Warbucks. And of course it wouldn't be the same if  the girls from Miss Hannigan's orphanage don't have adventures of their  own. <br />This is definitely a classic musical that will be an all-time  favorite for many years to come.
B00003CX5A|4.0|Sleepy Hollow is yet another chapter in Tim Burton's now overlong book of gothic films. While Sleepy Hollow does not exactly break any new ground for Burton it is less heavy handed and more sadistically funny than anything  he's ever done.<br />Depp plays Ichobod Crane, a New York City investigator  who's sent to the quiet town of Sleepy Hollow to discover why so many  people are having their heads cut off. As the film unfolds Depp unravels a  convoluded (and silly) plot that implacates some of the town's elite  citizens with the headless horseman, the gentleman cutting off the heads,  played by a constantly snarling Christopher Walken.<br />When you look back at  this film a lot of it seems unoriginal and cliched. However there is an  awful lot that is really great about this film which makes it hugely  entertaining despite some of its obvious short-comings.<br />Sleepy Hollow is  certainly one of the funniest movies of the year. Like the Fight Club it  does not seem to care who it will offend and Tim Burton goes all out on the  gory decapitation scenes. A lot of the jokes involve dead bodies including  one hilarious scene where Depp does an autopsy and fumbles with the corpse.  Depp's performance is also slyly excellent. He manages to play a character  who is both an idiot and a genius at the same time and also someone the  audience can laugh at and applaude in equal proportions. Christina Ricci is  given a part that is small and forgettable but does a really good job with  the material she is given.<br />As usual it is the cinematography and visuals  that shine through, like in all of Burton's films. Right from the start the  viewer is bombarded with beautiful, twisted gothic imagery that never lets  up until the end. The best sequence of the whole film occurs at the very  beginning where Depp travels from NY to Sleepy Hollow. As he travels you  notice that the stunning countryside shots become more and more bleak with  each moment.<br />Overall this is a very silly film. It is very entertaining  and there are a lot of things to be praised about Sleepy Hollow. It  certainly won't change your life but you will have a great time watching  it.
6305079900|5.0|Many of the reviews whine that the transfer to DVD is poor qualilty.  Their biggest complaint is the MONO soundtrack.  First they want to know  why it was not mastered in stereo.  Well that is how the sound track was in  the original film.  Cameron made the right choice in making the transfer  true to the original.  The second thing they complain about is why the  choice was made to do the original soundtrack in mono in the first place.  Simple, it was a Low Budget Movie.  It only had a total budget of  approximately $6 million dollars!  People seem to have forgotten that it  was a total shock when it came out.<br />I would not want to see the movie  changed at all.  It is perfect the way it is.

6304057709|4.0|Don't miss this movie! It's a brilliant adaptation of the Jane Austen classic and simply lovely to watch. Emma Thompson did an excellent job on the screenplay, and deservedly won an Oscar for her efforts.<br />I agree that  in the age department, Emma Thompson was not suited to carry the role of  Elinor Dashwood (who's supposed to be only 19). However, Ms Thompson's  acting was brilliant and flawless, and as the story unfolds and draws you  in, you hardly remember to notice or care about the age factor anymore. I  thought Emma Thompson's portrayal of Elinor was not unlike the character of  Margaret Schlegel (which she played in &quot;Howards End&quot;) who's also  a kind gentlewoman who loves too much and suffers inwardly.<br />As a story,  &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (S&amp;S) has a far more serious premise  compared to 2 other Austen works ie. &quot;Emma&quot; and &quot;Mansfield  Park&quot;. Perhaps this partly explains why S&amp;S is the more  highly-acclaimed movie (it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars)  compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's &quot;Emma&quot; and Frances O'Connor's  &quot;Manfield Park&quot;. In S&amp;S, there are very sad scenes involving  unrequited love, quiet suffering (Elinor's and Col. Brandon's) and long  illness (Marianne's). Many scenes will make you reach for that box of  tissues eg. when the always calm-and-collected Elinor burst into  uncontrollable tears the moment she hears the (happy) truth concerning  Edward Ferrar's situation, and when Marianne (still lying ill in her bed)  thanks Col. Brandon softly (for all his help and kindness).<br />I also admire  Alan Rickman's acting. He is perfect as Col. Brandon, a very good man whose  love for Marianne is (sadly) unrequited. His love is of the best kind - he  doesn't court with (empty) flowery words, instead he displays so much care,  concern, lovingness and tenderness by his every look towards Marianne and  by his every action to make her well and happy. I was nicely surprised that  in the movie, Col. Brandon looks more dashing and handsome than John  Willoughby (to me anyway).<br />Kate Winslet's &quot;Marianne&quot; is  adorable as well. She sings beautifully and has such grace and beauty that  it's no wonder men fell in love with her at first sight.<br />I shall not give  away the ending, of course. But for the benefit of any viewer who have not  read the novel but wish for a better and more satisfying understanding of  the final scene involving Marianne, just remember the following sentence  which I quote from the novel:<br />&quot;Marianne could never love by  halves.&quot;
B00003CX6P|5.0|Anthony Minguella's follow up to &quot;The English Patient&quot; is a haunting, devious work that is reminiscent to most of Alfred Hitchcock's best movies. Although &quot;Mr. Ripley&quot; is a &quot;mainstream&quot;  Hollywood work, it definitley does not play like it. In fact, this is the  reason I believe &quot;Mr. Ripley&quot; has been popular with critics and  film lovers but not so well recieved with your average movie fan.<br />Matt  Damon plays Tom Ripley. A poor man living in New York who is sent by a  millionaire ship-builder to recover his flamboyant son in beautiful Italy.  Ripley is, from the very beginning, a fake. A man who lies about virtually  everything and puts his master impersonation/forgery skills to good  use.<br />When he arrives in Italy he quickly finds the outlandish son played  superbly by Jude Law. He becomes friends with him and his girlfriend  (Gwyneth Paltrow) and before long is living out a fantasy life in  Italy.<br />It becomes apparent about half way through this movie that Tom  Ripley is a genuinly twisted man who is willing to do anything to keep his  auspicious position. This includes numerous murders, deception and total  cleverness.<br />The Talented Mr. Ripley is quite shocking in the sense that  the villain eventually prevails. There are some great suspense scenes along  the way and the acting is all first class. Damon turns in a spine tingling  performance that easily outshines his other great acting job in &quot;Good  Will Hunting.&quot; In that film he played a kind of hooligan genius, in  &quot;Mr. Ripley&quot; he is an utterly sinister genius that is far more  affecting. Jude Law got an Oscar nomination for his performance. He's not  that good (he was better in Gattaca) but he still does a decent job as the  debonaire, spoiled brat. Paltrow is fine and Philip Seymour Hoffman turns  in another great (yet unnoticed) performance as a lethargic, pretensious  rich kid.<br />Minguella does a wonderful job of keeping the storymoving.  &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; sometimes risks collapsing under its  own weight but Minguella knows what he is doing when holding the two and a  half hour film together.<br />&quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; is a  sinister masterpiece. It reaches back into the past with a very film-noir  approach which is both welcome and appreciated in the current sad-state of  Hollywood filmaking. Appreciate the film for what it is and don't be too  alarmed by the fact that the villain is the character that you are forced  to sympathize with. &quot;Mr. Ripley&quot; is different and should be  embraced for this, not condemned by people who want the usual Hollywood  formula movie. If you want to watch run of the mill Hollywood fluff, watch  the &quot;Cider House Rules.&quot; If you want evil genius watch  &quot;Ripley.&quot;
0800141709|5.0|A superb visual work of art.  Great Dialogue.  Brilliant acting.  Fantastic Story.  A must See for anyone who seeks entertainment that transcends time and Genre.
076783819X|4.0|This movie will keep you entertained, but you may not like the ending, altho it could be considered more realistic than a lot of stuff being done on this theme.  Definitely worth watching and talking about.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Without question the best Pearl Jam album as yet. As previous reviewers have mentioned, compared to their previous albums Binaural is a far more cohesive musical blend as a result of the more equal contributions of each  band member. Highly recommended.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is a true classic album. She has a truly magical voice, and it shows through this album. Buy it soon, you won't regret it.
B000000WCA|3.0|This was nice album. This is quite old and I've get bored to this, but I remember how much I loved Spice Girls music when this album came. &quot;Say You'll Be There&quot; is greatest song of the album and the others are  quite good too... But this still wasn't so good... I'm wondering why there  was so big Spice Girls mania?
B000001ES4|5.0|This CD came in the mail yesterday and I have not stopped listening to it yet!  The second track entitled &quot;Poeme&quot; is absolutely soul stirring and I'm amazed that I've not yet worn that track of the CD out.  The entire CD is fantastic.  This music is a gift from talented musicians  who are sure to be around a long, long time.  If you like the excerpts even  a tiny bit you'll love this CD.
630575067X|2.0|I didn't really like this movie.  There wasn't much action though I did like the pod-racing.  The characters were cool but kinda corny.  I fall asleep every time I watch this movie.  I suggest buying the first three  before this one because they were good.  I saw the special edition in the  movie theater and loved it but when I saw this one I liked it but got  bored.
B00004IC9G|5.0|let me say that the first time i heard this album it ripped right threw my chest, it was in 1984 at the height of metals reign. I got to witness the performance of MANOWAR many times at Lamour's in Brooklyn, New York, the  rock capital of earth at the time. Let me say that this was one of the rare  occasions that the live performance blew away the album , but the spirit  that lives in that recording is once of strength and excellence, a must for  any metal devotee, and a collectors piece with the orson wells  narration....
B00003CWL6|5.0|The plot line was a little controversial, but the movie was so good; you forget that you thought it was controversial.  I recommend it very much.  It is a movie that we should never forget.  Or I know I won't.  You'll  enjoy it.

6304466498|5.0|This was really funny.  If you have read some of my other reviews you might know that I'm a big fan of comedy movies.  This was really funny.  Was it the dirty jokes?  The funny lines?  The action and everything else  that happened in the movie.  I don't know what made this movie funny but it  just is.  BUY it.
0679746048|4.0|Girl Interrupted by:Susanna Kaysen was an excellent book which I would reccomend to anyone .  In most books there is just one plot but in this book there is lots of little plots , like what goes on in the seclusion  room, and the actionms of what some characters take and how they think .  This book was very realistic not only because it is a non-fiction book but  because of the details put in it . It had great character development  because like everytime a new character came the book would tell you when  and why they were there.This book was not very fast paced but it was not  boring either . It had both humorous and dramatic spots . What makes this  book different is that you actually feel kind of like you are one of the  characters in the book . The author's style of language was excellent , and  very understandable . I really thought the book was good , but it did have  a few parts that I could not understand . The characters in this story deal  with alot of things including a death of one of the characters to find out  who it is you will just have to read the book !
B000006045|5.0|Top-of-the-line mixed, mastered and recorded album. Does amazing things when played on audiophile equipment. Beautifull vocals, dynamics, very well composed. I don't think it's possible for Massive Attack to make a cd that  sounds better than this one. In one word: Respect! Everybody should listen  to this record, no matter what musical preferences they have.

B0000024SI|5.0|Make no mistake about it, as far as albums go, it was Meet the Bealtes and this album, respectively, that changed the face of 60s popular music.  It was the Bealtes that rekindled pop music and finally convinced and inspired  Dylan to embrace Rock n Roll as the medium for his message.  It was this  album that showed, with absolute brilliance, that Rock n Roll could carry a  tremendous literary power and beauty.  Those who analyse Dylan's couplets  and find nothing but nonsense miss the point.  The fact that such couplets  exist within a &quot;pop&quot; song is what was, and is, groundbreaking.   <br />And it's not just the lyrics.  Everything about this music was fresh,  exhilerating and thought-provoking.  Is it really important to know exactly  what the artist meant by his lyrics?  Since When?  If it provoked a smile,  a gasp of astonishment, even a cynical shake of the head, then I maintain  it has fulfilled the requirement of &quot;art.&quot; <br />We won't even get  into the licks of Mike Bloomfield, the celestial keyboard playing of Al  Kooper, or the rest of the kick-a-- band.<br />Just know this.  Rock music  doesn't get much rootsier, intelligent and downright kinetic than this.   Only Dylan even approached it again with Blonde on Blonde.
B00003ZA27|2.0|Man oh man.  This is pretty bad.  All I'm going to comment on right here is the tenors.  They like to sing loud and they don't like to sing on pitch and they don't like to sing with the other parts or the orchestra, let  alone the conductor...  Definitely pick another recording if you want the B  Minor Mass.
B00004SVIK|5.0|I bought the deluxe edition, with the 64 pg booklet, and was delighted!  Yes, it is on the pricey side, but when one considers that these are 20 year old tapes remastered... it is well worth it.  This is one of the best  Pink Floyd releases in YEARS!   I am amazed that these old recordings   where restored with such great effort, and they really are!  Any Pink  Floyd/Roger Waters fan will be delighted by this 2 CD set.  And it is among  the very few &quot;official&quot; live recordings available.   And as all  you PF fans know, much of their material is best when heard live... I think  you will like this... ALOT!  thanx jcs202
B000002HJR|5.0|Some of the New Orleans based band members of Pantera, Crowbar, C.O.C and Eyehategod have blended to produce one of the most  satisfying records ever. This album is incredible. They  toned themselves down to a rock disc  that has every song a favorite. Phil Anselmo sings with his incredible  voice on this disc(screams to though which is good). They go from a banger  like Temptations Wings to a slow great mood song like Jail.  The best part  of this record is the thought inspiring and personal lyrics actually sang  amazingly well by the screaming metal vulgar king Anselmo. Like they have  been saying there is a Southern sound in there thats hard to explain.  A  must have, unbelievable record, buy it. No way will you be dissapointed.  Best part is there is a new one supossedly very soon.  Classic disk.
B000002552|5.0|I'm an audiophile, and I must admit it sometimes gets in the way of appreciating great music.  Possibly the greatest example of this is The Basement Tapes.  Being a long-time Dylan fan I excitedly bought this album  when it was finally released in '75.  With all the mystique behind it, I  had great expectations.  But it just sounded so lo-fi, and the songs were  not where my head was at in '75, so I never really gave it it's due.  Of  course, I purchased it again in the CD age, but still never really sat down  and gave it my undivided attention.  When I finally did, I realized what  I'd been missing all those years.  First, the album is not as lo-fi as I  thought.  Though recorded primitively, it is evident that great care was  taken to get a good balance between the instruments and vocals.  It's true  that the fidelity is better on some cuts, but I don't buy the fact that the  Band cut some of these tracks in the studio after the Basement Tapes  sessions.<br />Anyway, what matters here are the songs and the way they are  performed.  Man, are these guys hot! To my ear, this is the best vocals  you'll ever hear from Richard Manuel, Rick Danko and Levon Helm.  The  instrumental backing is superb, at once totally sympathetic yet totally  inspired.  Oh, and Bob's in pretty good form, too.  These songs have a wit,  humor and accesability that seems to get stronger on every hearing.   <br />There is a reason that these sessions are legendary.  Buy it, listen to  it, and discover why so much mystique surrounded these sessions in the  first place.  Absolutely timeless music.<br />Sony, please give us the entire  sessions!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears has done it again. Another excellent CD that is sure to win a Grammy. This album is different from her last because it has more edgier R&amp;B tunes that make you wanna dance. Her first CD didn't exactly have  that and I believe that is why she didn't win a Grammy. The album was too  poppy she didn't show no edge. But she does in this one.   The best songs  on the album are Oops!...I Did It Again Stronger Don't Go Knockin' On My  Door (I Can't Get No)Satisfantion Don't Let Me The Last To Know What U See  (Is What U Get) Lucky One Kiss From You Can't Make You Love Me  I also  reccomend Christina Aguilera, that girl has such a beautiful voice.
B00004SCX6|4.0|For the second time, Britney gives us quality pop music. Only better this time. One listen to the song &quot;Stronger&quot; and you will find a more captivating sound than anything heard on Britney's debut album.  &quot;Lucky&quot; has a melody that really sounds sympathetic - it's a  charming one. Even though the title song sounds a lot like &quot;Baby One  More Time,&quot; is still continues an irresistable formula. I like the  turn around in the lyrics. In fact, much of the album fortunately is about  being tough and isn't fluffy. The song &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is more  well done than I thought it would be. Has a pretty intro and then goes into  a fun sing-along dance tune. This album has more beat in general than the  debut - aided by the songs &quot;What U See Is What U Get&quot; and  &quot;Can't Make You Love Me.&quot; Strong ballads with well written lyrics  include &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot; and &quot;When Your  Eyes Say It.&quot; Only negatives are the chatter between some songs, and  &quot;Dear Diary&quot; uses flat arrangements. But overall, Britney will  satisfy the pop fan in you.
B000002KH3|5.0|Van Halen, not Van Hagar, not Van What's-His-Name, in one of the best debut albums ever.  Imagine it is summer, 95 degrees, you have the window down, arm hanging out, and you see your dream girl.  This is the disk you  want pumping music out your windows.  On a day like that, probably the  inexorable Ice Cream Man.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears has done it again! Her debut album became a #1 hit immediately. Now, Britney's sophomore album will be another hit. She sure has matured as a person and as an artist. Her voice touches my heart when  she's singing. In the album &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;, she  captures the soul in her music. Britney also got to co-write one of the  songs. &quot;Dear Diary&quot;, which Britney co-wrote, is one of the best  songs in her album. She also did a wonderful re-make of &quot;(I Can't Go  No) Satisfaction.&quot; Good luck, Brit!

B00004T8RK|5.0|With days of difference, I'm having a lot of fun and joy with the releases of new records from two of my favorite bands: The Who and Pearl Jam (the third one is Cheap Trick). Don't care about critics say about  &quot;Binaural&quot;, just listen to the music and how this collection of  songs grows with every audition. From the storming start with  &quot;Breakerfall&quot;, &quot;Gods' Dice&quot; and &quot;Evacuation&quot;  to the wonderful sounds of &quot;Light Years&quot; and &quot;Thin  Air&quot;, through that amazing song called &quot;Nothing As It  Seems&quot;, we can see that Pearl Jam are in a healthy state and ready to  take every direction they want. In my opinion, the guys have done a great  work again. I recommend it to all of you. As Rick Nielsen wrote,  &quot;reputation is a fragile thing&quot;, but what a superb band they are.   Bravo, muchachos!
0515123447|4.0|I bought this book on a whim, and now, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Child can't write 'em fast enough. <br />I love Jack Reacher. The kind of guy a woman wants to take home and a man wants to be. <br />I too had problems with  Mr. Child's attention to detail, but I'm sure he'll get better (or his  editor will) with time. Read it, I know you'll like it.
B00004T8RK|4.0|The true result of great music is the emotions that it creates.  If you compare Pearl Jams albums to each other you are being narrow and this CD is not for you.  If you are a lover of music and the genius of Pearl Jam this  album will take you for an emotional ride that is deep, moving and  original.    In a time of corporation pop music everyone should reprogram  their ears and open up to the truthful sound of Pearl Jam.
0553213105|5.0|I always love reading about romance in England. Especially in the 17th &amp; 18th century. This book was no exception. Jane Austen dwells deep into human nature. How Elizabeth's pride is damaged, when Darcy refuses to  dance with her &amp; becomes prejudiced against him by Mr. Wickham. How  Darcy slowly finds himself falling in love with Elizabeth. All this is  potrayed marvellously by Jane Austen. I loved it so much that I've read it  about 5 times till now!
078322818X|5.0|George Lucas, who later dazzled us with a science fiction opus worthy of the ages, first dazzled us with this intimate movie about a generation of Americans at the end of the innocent 50s.  Though the soundtrack,  performances, set design and art direction are perfectly realized, it is  the tender-hearted direction and superb script of this movie that make it  so lasting.  Each time I see it I found it more powerful; like all good,  evocative pieces of history, this one holds up, and details a moment in  time with sensitivity, humor and a literal horde of excellent young  performers, including the rascally Harrison Ford, a bombshell mystery woman  in Suzanne Somers, a warm and melancholy Cindy Williams, and an excellent  Ron Howard.  If you have never seen this movie, it is time.

0440180295|5.0|The Children's Crusade, as i like to call it- i believe the publisher forced the name change (read the first chapter)- is without a doubt the best book i have read. Along with Catch 22, it turned me from a child facinated by war and eager for glory into a young adult who is totally  opposed to armed conflict. The writing style allows the reader to enter a  dream, or trance like state, where events have no order, and things just  happen. It helps you to empathise with billy pilgrim. you become billy  pilgrim, and you end up with the same sense of helplessness. However, you  don't end up with billy's lack of concern. I think that is the whole point  of this masterpiece. A truly world altering book.
0140288503|5.0|This book will grab you from page one.  Mr. Bowdin has produced one of the best books written about close quarters combat.  A reader will find that they have to catch their breath after reading this book--that's how much  you'll get caught up in the action!<br />The heroism of the men who  participated in this operation should never be forgotten.

B00004SCX6|5.0|My friend told me that she had a hidden track called ''Sunflower'' on her cd after dear diary, and so i went and listended to my cd and it was not there, so i went to the store and bought another copy of her album...and it  had it, i guess that its only on selected cds, and my friend lisa has it on  her album to..the song is 3:45 minutes long, and its called ''Sunflower''.  THe cousre goSe like this<br /> You didnt want me to grow or spread my wings  but now that I have my sunflower my sunflower will grow it will leave it  will die and now im prepared to fly<br />on the thankyous on this album with  this secret track it says<br />To Mariah: Thankyou for my sunflower.<br />So, if  you dont have the track and you have the album, the first 500,000 unites  that JIVE shiped out did NOT have the secret track on it, but the other  500,000 does..so ask your record store if they have recived the second  batch of her album if you want the song.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|When this record first came out, I bought it at the Naval base PX in Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean. It was stuck, in a small bin, between Air Supply, Foreigner, Foghat and Reo Speedwagon. The few of us  &quot;punks&quot; on our fast frigate wore this record down. London  Calling, the Buzzcocks, Generation X, Germs, Black Flag, Avengers all kept  us sane while we cruised the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean during the  Tehran hostage crisis. This is an ESSENTIAL cd for every collection.
B00004T8RK|2.0|Big PJ fan.  Own and love all their records.  Been looking forward to this record as something new, different and interesting. I wasn't looking for another Yield, Vs. or anything else they had put out.  After three listens  I just don't find it very interesting.  Except for a couple of songs the  rest is just dull.  No particular aspect of the album holds my interest for  long.  DULL.  I am truly sorry to say this, but to this Pearl Jam fan, it  IS kind of disapointing.
B000002KHH|5.0|I grew up on this record. As Looney Tunes introduced me to classical music, Sabbath introduced me to mental instability. Thank you, Ozzy.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Oops is right. This CD is probably one of the worst CDs in the world. All the songs except one are too simaler to her first CD. There are just watered down techno + l;yrics that nobody cares about it and what does it =  cheerleading music.<br />The other song I am talking about is Satisfaction. It  is a ROCK song is by the Rolling Stones, a ROCK band and should only be  featured on a ROCK CD, cassette, 8 track, or record.<br />These are my  opinions and I appoligize if I hurt someones feelings, including the  artist's.
B00003CWL5|4.0|Now, at this point, I am in agreement with some of you who say that this film has been offensive at times. I also feel that once you get into it, you see a true beauty. I'm kinda of out with the jury here, but I will say  that I liked the ending because Lester was at peace with himself and what  happened. I liked it. Now, the wife, she lived in another zone completely.  The daughter as well,(her and that boy were compatible), and her friend was  just I'm so beautiful. Now, forgive me, but I am still unsure who did him  in (My bet is the wife).All I can say is what a film!
B00004SCX6|1.0|I saw this cd previwed on tv, and it made me wonder how this girl has found such fame. Her voice is trite and material repetitive. I expect to find hundreds of her cd'ds in the bargain bin a yr from today!  OOPs is a  real sorry statement. Miss Spears is the latest &quot;Barbie&quot; of rock,  pop.
B00004SVIK|1.0|I bought this album thinking that the songs would sound different than they did on the studio album. They don't. If you want to hear an astounding version of Run Like Hell, then pick up Pulse. I like Pink Floyd much better  without the control-freak known as Roger Waters(i.e Pulse, Division Bell  and MLOR.) Pulse is so much better than this that it is almost frightening.  Yeah, the sound quality is good but the energy just isn't there. Hey You  sounds exactly like it does on the album and so does Mother. It is just so  frustrating listening to this album. David Gilmour cared about the music.  Roger Waters cared about the image and the message the album had to convey.  If you care about the music, pick up Pulse. You will not be disappointed.  By the way, if anyone wants to buy this deplorable album from me, I'd be  happy to sell it at a very good price.
0606183787|4.0|I am suprised that I am the only one to attempt at writing the first review for this book, as it is so incredibly good! I've given it at birthday gifts, marked it to death, throw it in everyone's backpacks and I  still can't get over how good it is! Grippingly honest this books  chronicles the life of the virgin male character as he goes through life in  this virgin state of mind. High school puts it's impression on him and  you'll feel the high's and low's of life with him. In the end he's never  the same, and neither are you. Pay special attention to poem that's stuck  in the middle of it!
078322947X|3.0|There are actually two versions of this film attributed to William Friedkin: this is the longer (and more tedious) of the two and is probably the truer 'Friedkin cut'. It contains almost 40 minutes of additional  material on the front of the main action, providing explanatory background  material for each of the film's main protagonists. It also contains a final  twist at the end, which was cut from the other version, released under the  story's original title of &quot;Wages of Fear&quot;. The later (&quot;Wages  of Fear&quot;) cut was an altogether grittier version than this earlier  (&quot;Sorcerer&quot;) one, with all scenes shorter and tighter than their  equivalents here and with some reordered to keep the story moving along  faster. (The explanatory material from the beginning was edited heavily,  and used in bursts of flash-back during the journey scenes, for example.)  It also contains a couple of scenes which never made it into this version,  which provide an interesting alternative sequence of events from those  portrayed here! Sadly, the other version suffers heavily from  over-sanitisation (all of the political terrorist connotations have been  expunged, for example) and has truly dreadful over-dubbing of all  non-English dialogue: a great pity as otherwise the remade &quot;Wages of  Fear&quot; would have been an altogether better film than this is. That  said, this version has some truly gripping moments, wonderfully enhanced by  the haunting Tangerine Dream soundtrack and it is well worth a watch. It is  just such a shame that this DVD has been mastered from such a poor quality  copy of the print, and a standard 3:2 format one at that. It has had a  better job of panning and scanning applied to it than the TV copy of the  later &quot;Wages of Fear&quot; received, but it still loses much in this  format. Disappointing, overall.
0671042858|1.0|After enjoying King's lyrical prose and some of the best storytelling I have ever read in 'Bag of Bones' and experiencing the final walk along the Green Mile, 'Tom Gordon' failed. King used the idea of being lost in the  woods to try to evoke fright but never does.The best of King's new works  consist of original plots mixed with remarkable dialogue-both of which are  absent here.King's attempt seems to show that even the best writers have  their off days-better luck next time. Any King afficiando looking to be  enthralled or excited should not read this book.
B00003CWL6|4.0|I liked this movie.  You have to watch it for the messages and it is even more profound for those who identify with the characters.  Those who dislike this movie are either too afraid that the movie is right and dont  wan't their world to shatter or are, sadly, unable to identify with the  feeling expressed.  For those of you who say that intelligece has  everything to do with either or not you like this movie, I say your wrong.   I liked the movie and I'm an extremely bright person, I liked it because it  was true for me.  If it isn't for you than thats fine but don't knock  something you don't understand.
0312117337|5.0|What a wonderful surprise I found when I opened this deck of tarot!  Not only is the artwork absolutely beautiful, but the commentary that accompany each card focuses on an internal resolution instead of being directed by an  external source.  The answers we need are buried inside us and this deck  helps to remind us to turn within for our guidance.    I found a couple of  the commentaries to be a bit vague, so it requires that you put some time  and effort into thinking about your situation and how the card applies to  you.<br />As a relatively novice tarot reader I feel that I lucked out by  choosing this set as my second deck.  I doubt I'll ever need another.

014028009X|3.0|#1 Bestseller in Britain, and it's easy to see why. This fictional diary of a 30ish single career woman in London reflects the all concerns and insecurities of her kind, in a breezy, witty, quick read that will not tax  anyone in any way. Fielding's heroine's worries and dislikes are all fairly  obvious, and her mistakes, while gently amusing, aren't particularly  insightful. Her daily tallies of calories, alcohol units, cigarettes, lotto  tickets, and so forth, are supposed to be a barometer to her inner self,  which is mainly influenced by the progress of her love life. It starts off  as amusing, but as the book progresses, Bridget gets more and more annoying  in her self-pitying and general immaturity. I guess there are 30ish women  like this in the world, but thankfully not among my friends.
B00003CWN2|5.0|Boys Don't Cry is a very, very painful movie to watch.  I loved it, but it evoked such emotion from me...I am afraid I will never, EVER watch it again.  I loved Hillary Swank in this film, and I understand why she won  Best Actress.  Chloe was wonderful as well.  I agree with the person who  wrote that Hillary was not pretending to be a boy, she was a boy.  She did  become Brandon.  This is definitely a film that everyone should watch.
B00003CWPQ|2.0|I watched this movie with every intention and hope of liking it. I have been a fan of every Kubrick film. And after reading other reviews here, I really wish I could be as thoughtful, insightful and come up with a  meaningful review for this master of cinema and his last film.<br />But I  can't. I just don't get this film. I don't know if this is true, but I had  heard that Kubrick once said he wanted to make a porn movie with star  actors. Well, I wouldn't call it porn, but this, I guess, is that vision  realized. <br />The only thing that like about &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; is  you get to see beautiful Nicole Kidman naked. And that should really being  missing the point entirely for a Kubrick film. But having a few minutes of  film in my video collection of one of the world's most gorgeous women  erotically and gloriously nude, is the only pleasure I derive from watching  this movie. Tom Cruise is a lucky man. But as a viewer of this film, I  didn't feel quite so lucky except for the glimpses of Ms. Kidman. Still not  enough for most people to want to buy this film. But if you're like me buy  it just for the nude minutes of Nicole and skip the rest of the film. And  then buy other films like &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; &quot;Full Metal  Jacket&quot; &quot;2001&quot; &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; , etc., and watch  Kubrick at his best.
B00004ST9Q|1.0|This is a great DVD but be aware when you go buy one in store.  When it gets through track 14, it woudn't go to track 15.  My DVD player stopped right there.  I asked Tower Record in San Francisco, they told me they got  some complaints about that already.  So be prepared when you go buy one.
B00004T8RK|1.0|This is not one of Pearl Jam's better albums.  The typewritter at the end was more satisfying to my ears than the music itself! What happened to their old melodies?  The last couple of albums, I have not enjoyed.  The  only thing fascinating about this album is the head phone trick for 2 of  the songs.  (Surround sound).  Other than that, I should have saved my  money.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Sexy Britney + unique voice + melodious music = The Album &quot;Oops! I did it again!&quot; I am certain quite a bunch of you out there would agree with my equation.<br />If you have watched the music video, I am sure you will  love this CD even more. It's evident that lots of effort is put into this  fantastic album. I suppose my favourite song is &quot;Oops, I did it  again&quot;! It is a very vigorous, energetic song. And the tune keeps  playing in my mind, evidence to the power of the music.<br />If you are  considering whether or not to buy this CD, I would highly recommend mend  you to purchase it. I assure you hours of listening pleasure! Perhaps you  would even dance along! Hehz... =]
B000002UJQ|5.0|No doubt the best album of the 90's and one of the best ever.  Although the first listen may scare you, believe me, it will grow on you quick, and then before you know it, it is stuck in your cd player forever.
B000002LCD|5.0|Of all artists Madonna has verified that change is good, but everyone knows her best was always her first.  The best song on this cd is &quot;Look of Love.&quot; She blows me away with every word she says.  HER  FEELINGS ARE EXCENTUATED IN EVERY BEAT.  THIS CD IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY!   IS WELL
B00000JPH5|5.0|I was ecstatic when this movie was re-released!  This is one of my favorite movies from childhood, and I still love it now.  David Bowie is great as the enticing but evil goblin king.  Jennifer Connely at first is  whiny, but soon gets better.  Love the songs.  The final face-off is really  good...parallels the temptation of Jesus.  Lots of fun stuff in the  labyrinth and classic triumph over evil.
B000020617|5.0|this is the best foo fighters album ever put out.  i've loved the foos since their first album, and they just keep getting better.  All the songs are great especiallly learn to fly.  it also contains a spiffy video of  learn to fly that u can play on your computer.  way to go foos!
B00003CX5A|5.0|I am a HUGE Tim Burton fan. He has created some of the most unique and visually stunning films I have ever seen and Sleepy Hollow did not disappoint. I sat in the theatre mesmorized by the effects, the story, the  scenery, the acting, the photography, etc. etc. What a wonderfully scary,  yet delightful picture. SEE IT TODAY!
0679777547|3.0|This book was impressively complex -- with the author's obvious deep research into old books and writers.<br />Of course, it helps if you've read &quot;The Three Musketeers.&quot;  I wish I had.  I probably would have  appreciated this book more.<br />The build up was exciting, but the ending was  a little too watered down.  What happened?  Who was the girl?  Who had sent  her?  Was I missing something?
B00004SCX6|1.0|THERE WAS REALLY ONLY 1 GOOD SONG ON HER FIRST ALBUM SO I WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH. SHE SOUNDS VERY CHILDISH. MY FRIEND HAS THIS ALBUT. OOPS.....I DID IT AGAIN REALLY SOUNDS THE SAME AS ALL HER OTHER SONGS. IT REALLY ISN'T A GOOD  QUALITY CD. THE SONGS AREN'T VERY CATCH. I WOULD RECOMMEND CHRISTINA  AGULIERA OR PINK.
B000000WFZ|5.0|Passion permeates each cut, and each cut will bring you back into the scenes of DeNiro crawling up the slippery hill in penance, or of Irons walking with the cross held high toward attacking soldiers.<br /><br />You'll close  your eyes and see the children wading through a shallow creek picking out  floating violins. You'll hear them singing while the leaders approach the  mission for the first time.<br /><br />For fans of soundtracks, you'll find it richly enhanced with tracks subtle in the movie. Though classically influenced, listeners will find that it transcends standard orchestral music and easy to enjoy in the car as much as the home.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Mission: Original Soundtrack From The Motion Picture\\" (and the movie).<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />[...]
B00004T8RK|4.0|After my initial nirvana wore off, I sat down to write a better review of this album.  First off, all of you &quot;Ten&quot; freaks go away; don't review this album.  &quot;Ten&quot; was their worst album, and only us  LOYAL Pearl Jam fans can see that.  I'm sorry that we hear something you'll  never hear.<br />With that said, this is a strong Pearl Jam album.  It's  &quot;Yield&quot; crosses with &quot;No Code&quot;, really.  The results  fall somewhat short of their 1994 masterpiece &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, but are  a definite improvement over the dismal &quot;Ten&quot; and &quot;No  Code&quot;.<br />The album opens with three rockers.  None are as good as  &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot; or &quot;Whipping&quot;, but they are good  nonetheless.  &quot;God's Dice&quot; is a definite ear catcher.<br />From  there, the album continues to grow.  &quot;Light Years&quot; and &quot;Thin  Air&quot; are some good ballads.  They're not as good as  &quot;Vitalogy&quot;'s &quot;Nothingman&quot;, but that was like a  once-in-a-career song.  &quot;Insignificance&quot; is a rollicking  semi-rocker about death and war.  &quot;Grievance&quot; is yet another  ear-catching power rocker, probably the best rocker on the album.   &quot;Rival&quot; and &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot; are two other  semi-rockers; &quot;Rival&quot;'s message especially grabbed me.   &quot;Soon Forget&quot; is a beautiful experiment.<br />There are reasons,  however, as to why this is no &quot;Vitalogy&quot;.  &quot;Nothing as it  Seems&quot; and &quot;Of the Girl&quot; are definitely weaker tracks.   &quot;Parting Ways&quot; was formerly titled &quot;Long Road&quot; on the  &quot;Merkinball&quot; single.  It's a little better than that grueling  song, because it's about half its length.  The hidden track is  pointless.<br />I'll tell you right now, these songs won't be instantly  striking.  The first time I heard this album, I only liked &quot;God's  Dice&quot;, &quot;Light Years&quot;, &quot;Grievance&quot;,  &quot;Rival&quot;, and &quot;Soon Forget&quot;.  Please don't be  discouraged, fellow Pearl Jam fans!  I gave this album repeated listenings  and I grew to love it.  You all do the same; you'll thank me later.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I WAS A LITTLE SCARED WHEN I FOUND OUT TCHAD BLAKE WAS PRODUCING.  I OWN TWO LOSLOBOS RECORDS HE PRODUCED AND ALWAYS THOUGHT HIS BINAURAL(SETTING UP MICROPHOPNES WHERE EARS WOULD BE) WAY OF RECORDING WAS MUFFLED.mAYBE PJ  REALIZED THIS AND THATS WHY BRENDON O BRIEN REMIXED SOME OF THE SONGS.  ANY  WAY MY WORST FEARS WERE CONFIRMED WHEN I BOUGHT THE SINGLE, AND WHILE ALL  SONGS DO NOT SOUND LIKE THERE WERE BEING RECORDED THROUGH COTTON BALLS,  ENOUGH ARE BOTCHED TO MAKE ME LONG FOR THE CLARITY OF OBRIEN'S PRODUCTION.  IS IT ME OR ARE SOME OF EDDIE'S VOCALS HARD TO UNDERSTAND LIKE EARLY REM.  MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE TRIED SCOTT LITT OR STEVE ALBINI IF THEY WANTED TO  CHANGE UP A LIITLE.

I am constantly thinking of ways to improve my craft.  Learn a  new skill.  Develop a new tool.  What went wrong?  How can I do better next  time?<br />Programming is a rapidly changing craft.  A machinist can learn to  work a lathe or a milling machine, and expect that his knowledge will stand  him in good stead for the rest of his working life.  Not so for the  craftsman programmer.  Ours is a new craft.  We are still learning how to  do it.  Having survived in the game for a decade or two, and having learned  dozens of languages, operating systems, database management systems,  transaction processing managers, editors, we come to the realisation that  this is a hard game.  Each of us learns skills that help us cope with all  that change.  We learn basic programming skills.  We go on learning them.  We learn to see what is coming, and move in anticipation.  We learn what is  important, and what is not.  We watch those who are successful, and try to  emulate them.  We watch the unsuccessful with horrid fascination, and try  to learn from them also.  &quot;There but for the grace of God go  I!&quot;<br />I don't know how to make an object oriented design.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This has got to be my favorite movie ever made. It's sounds extremely  cliche; a man's praise for a superficially masculine,  testosterone-drenched, wham-bam-thank you ma'am pile of celluloid. Not at  all true. This film made me think, and no movie fitting the preceding  description has ever accomplished that. This film also shocked me with  frank but intelligant philosophy, stunning performances credited to Helena  Bonham Carter and Edward Norton, and original-ironically trendy-premise and  execution. The sensationalism, assumed to be horribly adolescent, is so  effective, the audience is left gathering itself and arriving to the  conclusion that while it may have its share of violence, slapstick,  shockers, and bizarre mannerisms, there was a lot to think about in all  that. You can thank this film for the strangest slice of a reality gone  reanimated, as a nameless Joe Average plunges into a tale of mischeif,  mayhem, and soap. Edward Norton is the timid white-collar consumer, a  simple materialist with an addiction to stuff he doesn't need but buys to  fill holes in his pathetic, numbing existence, like anyone else would.  Stricken with the boredom of office jargon and despondency, while suffering  heavy insomnia, Norton finds an obscure comfort, and pitiful just as well,  touring support groups for diseases and what not, releasing tears and his  sleeping restraints. while this is all well and good, his encounter with  the vivaciously-dead Helena Bonham Carter lands him back in square one,  resolving to his new (single-serving) friend: Tyler Durden. Enigmatic,  rebellious, confident, vulgar, unconventional, and smart, Tyler (Brad Pitt)  leads his pal into a foreign world of obscure humor, the dangers of  soap-making, the philosophy of chaos and anti-sociality, theraputic  violence, and taking action against the ideals of the material world that  chains us all. Unfortunantly, Tyler expands his quest to unchaining more  and more people, until massive and ludicrousterrorism throws Norton into a  plot that threatens society entirely, and places Norton on the other side  of the world we all take for granted. Collectively, this film was amazingly  written, directed, acted, filmed, and produced to create one of the most  misunderstood and underrated films of the decade. See this film for  everything it can offer you-which I garuntee heartily is a lot.  kyle@porterworks

B00003CWQ2|5.0|Fight Club&quot; an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the &quot;Choose life,&quot; anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of  &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme  -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of  risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton)  is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his  job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his  IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing  with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape  from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham  Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his  routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic  soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy  lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two  men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first,  it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a  bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and  satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are  desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting  wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and  pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it  becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just  organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark,  pessimistic worldview of &quot;Seven&quot; and married it with the clever  plot twists and turns of &quot;The Game&quot; and assembled his strongest  effort to date. &quot;Fight Club&quot; is a $50+ million studio film that  remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message --  right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes &quot;Fight  Club&quot; a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate  message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in  interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its  structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an  incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place  like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead  stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that  completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything  together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is  the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the  A+B+C formula? &quot;Fight Club&quot; openly rejects this tired, clearly  outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze  frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only  reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been  greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the  project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only  choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with &quot;Kalifornia&quot; and  &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot;, Pitt grunges himself down and disappears  completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many  of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess  that'll surely have the &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; fans running for  the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the  simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the  flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek  yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the  last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly  our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry  observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They  are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world  which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the  notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what &quot;Fight  Club&quot; tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it  challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a  materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, &quot;win.&quot; I  think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate  monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we  really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation  through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that  makes &quot;Fight Club&quot; a dangerously brilliant film that entertains  as well as enlightens.
6302787564|3.0|Some people think this film is about violence or anger or racism. It's not, though. It's about sadness. The sadness that comes when life loses its meaning. The kind of sadness that can drive a man to do terrible  things.<br />Michael Douglas stars as an unemployed defense worker who is  having a very bad day. It starts with him being stuck in traffic on an L.A.  freeway. No one is moving, his air conditioner is broken, and the exhaust  fumes are overpowering. Finally, he abandons his car and sets out on foot.  (The opening scene is an homage to the opening of Fellini's &quot;8  1/2.&quot;)<br />The unnamed Douglas character, as he frequently says, is just  trying to get home. He doesn't want any trouble; he just wants to see his  family. Events, though, seem to conspire against him.<br />Along the way, he  runs into a Korean grocer, Hispanic gangbangers, a homeless man, a neo-Nazi  skinhead, and other colorful SoCal denizens who drive him to the edge.  That's where the violence begins. This brings him to the attention of Sgt.  Prendergrast (Robert Duvall), a police officer who is about to retire.  Before he does, though, he is determined to catch Douglas.<br />Despite being  on opposite sides of the law, the similarities between these two men are  greater than the differences. Both of them are failures at home and at  work. Both of them lead lives that have never quite lived up to their  expectations; lives of &quot;quiet desperation.&quot; The only difference  is in how each man copes with his failures.<br />Michael Douglas is excellent  in this role, playing it in a very controlled and understated way. It would  have been very easy to go over the top with it, but he never does. Duvall  is good, as usual, in the more reserved, low profile part.<br />What is most  compelling about this story is how real it seems. The things Douglas does  are thing we've all thought about doing. The things he feels--the anger,  the helplessness--are all things we've felt. In that sense, he represents a  side of ourselves; a side we don't want to admit we have, but one that we  can't deny.
0425163407|5.0|This is an excellent book for a weekend by the fire read. Especcially if you enjoy murder and viruses. This is a different turn for Cornwell. In other books she usually deals with villains who are suffering from APD.  However, a realistic, and frighteningly NORMAL bad guy is a good choice for  a novel. I heartily recommend this book for anoyone who like trying to  solve a crime along with that main character.
0792156684|4.0|I wish the Oscars had a category for &quot;Best Ship&quot;. Then, Titanic could have justifiably cleaned up on all the technical awards and the &quot;Best Ship&quot; award. But barring the existence of such a category,  it justifiably netted Best Picture.<br />I was first drawn to see  &quot;Titanic&quot; for two reasons. First and foremost, I have been a  Titanic nut since childhood and was thrilled by what I had heard about this  film. Second, I saw one of the teasers in which Billy Zane was chasing  Leonardo De Caprio and Kate Winslet through a water filled room on this  sinking ship and shooting at them. The premise of being chased and running  for one's life on board one of the greatest maritime disasters of all times  struck me as highly original.<br />The story was a bit shallow and in some  cases poorly executed. For example, when Kate Winslet described the Titanic  as a sort of gilded cage, I simply did not believe her. Even if she hated  her oppressive marital engagement, I doubt she would have had such a view  of the ship. <br />Despite the mediocre plot, the actors did perform well. Leo  and Kate were charming, and Billy Zane--a very underrated actor--was  marvelous. The most impressive performance, however, was that of the ship.  The reproduction and special effects were simply astounding. Usually I  don't give a damn about such things, but in this case I was truly  impressed. Days later, I poured over Titanic books and photos and could  identify specific photos based on how precisely the film had reproduced  them. The ship was also splendid in her live performance before the cameras  of the Russian submersible. She was a haunting and beautiful sight in her  watery grave. <br />Although I dismissed the plot as being rather meaningless,  I was surprised to find that many people in Mainland China loved it. I went  to China in 1998 and was frequently asked about two things: Bill Clinton,  and &quot;Titanic&quot;. When I told one woman that the plot had notimpressed me that much, she replied that I had to understand how incredible  it was to an audience in mainland China that two lovers could defy their  social class in order to be together. I guess the post-structuarlist  theorists are right: no matter what a creator's intention, individuals  reinterpret (and essentially recreate) a work of art from their own unique  perspectives.
6303398480|4.0|I think Stargate gets panned a little unfairly. It's not a particularly great film, true; but I think it's good fun nonetheless. It doesn't bog the plot down with explanantions of pseudoscience or ancient history, and it  sticks to simple characterisation. It's the kind of movie that grows on  you, and has more akin to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series or &quot;The  Mummy&quot; than Star Wars.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|13 Tracks of Classic a-ha   -  A treasure for a-ha fans the world over.  With the Hit &quot;Summer Moved ON&quot; to songs like  &quot;Minor Earth Major Sky&quot;, &quot; I Wish I Cared&quot; and &quot;Velvet&quot;, A-ha  does not let us down.  I recommend this album to all that are still humming  the tune &quot;Take On Me&quot; or &quot;Dark is the Night&quot;.
B00003Q438|4.0|The Abyss: Special Edition shows why you really can't take a heavy hand to James Cameron's films. Sure, if left the way he wanted them, they tun out to be three-hour epics. The problem is, it's often the case that plot-vital  scenes, like the tidal wave sequence in this film, get left on the  cutting-room floor. If you liked The Abyss, it's more than worth getting  this product for the restoration of that scene alone. If you didn't like  it... Give the Special Edition a look anyway, the movie might make sense  now.<br />I must admit, James is a bit heavy-handed in his anti-nuke stance in  this movie. His NTIs give us the message during the tidal wave sequence,  and we get it again when Bud Brigman relays the NTIs' message to Deepcore  and the surface (another partially cut scene).<br />Nonetheless, the Special  Edition of The Abyss is definitely a worthwhile buy.

B000002N2Z|3.0|This debut album from the awesome California nu-metal foursome is quite good, if a little rough around the edges.  The band obviously knows how to play loud (witness Minus Blindfold, 7 Words and Engine No. 9) but there are  also some decent melodies found (Bored, Fireal, Lifter).  The songs are  pretty good throughout, although inferior to those on Around The Fur.  The  song quality is not at all this album's weakness, however.  The main  problem is the &quot;raw&quot; approach to production, which leaves the  songs sounding fuzzy and unfocused.  Chino's lyrics are indecipherable,  even more so on Around The Fur, and the instruments lack the bite and  crunch present on ATF songs such as My Own Summer and MX due to a cleaner  production.  Overall, this is a great showcase for a band with loads of  potential, even with its flaws.  Thankfully, this band lived up to the high  expectations with its stellar follow up.  This is a must-have for Deftones  fans, but if you're looking to be introduced to what these guys are all  about, get Around The Fur first.
B000002ADT|5.0|I can only echo what others have said: An all-star lineup, incredible playing, classic tunes. The best introduction to the bop era for the new listeners, and an absolute must-own for any jazz fan.
0451191153|5.0|Just finished reading The Fountainhead for the fifth time.  The first time was over a decade ago, and I read it every couple years when I'm feeling down or just generally need a &quot;pick-me-up.&quot;  Interestingly, the  book was much funnier this time.  Maybe because I was focused in other  areas in the past, but this time I caught a lot more humor and actually  laughed out loud a few times (&quot;The Gallant Gallstone,&quot; the manner  in which Roark talks to Toohey, etc.).  For anyone that hasn't read this  book, you owe yourself.  For those that have read it, read it again and  enjoy the subtle humor.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Are there still any music fans out there who *haven't* heard of this album? Back when rock was maturing and growing more sophisticated, and groups were starting to produce &quot;concept&quot; albums, Brian Wilson  discared the formulas that made the Beach Boys- Sun, Surf, Cars and Girls-  and wrote and produced an intensely personal album that wasn't all that  popular in its time. Since then it's been called a work of genius, Brian  Wilson's &quot;Sargent Pepper&quot; and other laudatory titles.<br />It's  certainly a great album, and perhaps an important album, and without a  doubt the most musically sophisticated of the Beach Boys' albums; it also  contains what may be the best song Brian Wilson ever wrote (God Only Knows,  which Paul McCartney called &quot;the perfect pop song). It's not really a  concept album, though. The songs range from the great (&quot;God Only  Knows&quot;, &quot;Caroline No&quot;) through the mundane, and &quot;Sloop  John B.&quot; is hardly a Beach Boys song, popular though the single was.  Most of the songs are Wilson's personal statements  that, while musically  sophisticated, reveal an almost embarassingly adolescent outlook- and  perhaps his coming breakdown as well.<br />And yet for all this it's still a  magnificent album, musically and lyrically. Required listening for all  Beach Boys fans, 60s music fans, and fans of lyrical pop music of all ages.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is probably one of the best books I've ever read.  It's a hilarious satire on the insanity of war and bureaucracy.  However, the book can be rather hard to follow at times because of the way that Heller moves  back and forth.  The book is not organized chronologically either.  It is  organized more through important events regardless of their place in time.   The flashbacks kept me on the edge of my seat, however, because of the fact  that only a small amount was revealed every time a situation was referred  to, until finally the whole scene is revealed.  The book evolves from a  comedy to tragedy throughout the story, such as Yossarian's trips to the  hospital.  Which eventually grow from silly made up illnesses, to serious  life threatening ones.
B0000029DD|5.0|When I first bought this album in 1995. I gave it some listens and liked just 3 songs off it, the radio-friendly 'Last Goodbye', 'Eternal Life', and 'Grace'. After a time it left my play list as most of my new purchases do.  Then In 1996 I started playing music of my own. A few years of this and  listening to lots of new things matured me some musically, and a few months  ago I gave &quot;Grace&quot; some more listens. From the first minute I  knew I was hearing it on a different level. And a few days later it became  the ONLY thing I was listening to. This music is so deep and complicated  emotionally, musically, and spiritually that you have to submit yourself to  it to really appreciate everything it has to offer. His music and this  album in particular has really given me a new perspective with my own music  and has reinvigorated me. You can love this album on so many different  levels. Great vocals, great lyrics, great guitar playing, great chord  changes, and deep emotion. He scores an A+ on each.. I miss this man deeply  and I didn't even know I loved him til after he was gone.
B000003S2O|5.0|This is an amazing piece of work.  In my opinion Eno's finest ambient recording.  I remember listening to this when it first came out at my parents house when my brother walked in.  He said, &quot;What is that  sound?  Are you listening to a record?&quot;  I've always thought Eno would  have liked that response.  Anyway, brilliant textures, virtually no melodic  or harmonic content, and few recognizable instrumental sounds.  It's not so  much music as it is a sound environment-it's really unlike anything else  I've ever heard by Eno or anyone else (Apollo is probably the nearest  comparison.) Buy it.
B000002JQ6|5.0|14 heart-thumping, headbanging, body-jumping songs AC/DC is mostly known for are featured on this CD.  Brian Johnson's raspy voice pours out such vigor in song's such as &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, &quot;Dirty Deeds Done  Dirt Cheap&quot;, and &quot;Highway To Hell&quot;.  If you are a fan of  heavy metal, this CD must be in your collection.  &quot;For Those About To  Rock (We Salute You) is appropriate for the last song.  During this seven  minute song, you will continue to be rocking!

0800177177|4.0|This was one of the first DVDs you could buy, so, you can imagine how plain it is. The menu, compared with the later DVD's menus, is like D.O.S. compared with Windows 2000. The colors are a bit blurry, the sound quality  is very good. The DVD lacks of special features, and is single layer.  Another fault is the translations of the hungrian speechs are permanent,  so, when you choose spanish subtitles, they are over those characters, and  this is a little unpleasant. If you are a Dracula fan, don't regret buying  this DVD, but if what you are seeking for is a DVD with full special  features and great picture quality, you'll be a bit dissapointed.

B000002JSZ|5.0|After the massive success of BACK IN BLACK and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK a backlash against AC/DC was inevitable.  Unfortunately that backlash came at the expense of one of AC/DC's best albums, FLICK OF THE SWITCH.  Much  better than the inconsistent FTATR, FLICK really captures AC/DC at their  best.  With such great songs as &quot;Bedlam In Belguim,&quot; &quot;Guns  For Hire,&quot; and the classic title track, FOTS continues the style of  BACK IN BLACK, albeit with a slightly bluesier feel.  &quot;Landslide&quot;  and &quot;Brain Shake&quot; are a great pair of uptempo, high energy bursts  of power, and give the album something most of their recent albums have  lacked - diversity in the tempo of the songs, giving it a great flow from  one song to the next.  There's not a bad (or even weak) song on this album,  the last GREAT album from AC/DC.  I'ts also the last album that saw Brian  Johnson at full strength (before he blew out his voice!).  After FOTS it  would be a run of several good, but not great, albums.  If you don't  already own this one, get it now.  It is the  perfect complement to BACK IN  BLACK.  --(And if you like this one check out Def Leppard's HIGH N DRY or  Krokus' ONE VICE AT A TIME)
B00000IQBL|5.0|anybody who says this movie is bad, they are sadly mistaken.  this movie is one of the best i have ever seen, and trust me i've seen a lot of movies.  other people say only the first half of the movie is good, they  are also sadly mistaken.  the first half is boot camp, with an excellent  performance by R. Lee Ermey as gunnery sargent Hartman.  the second half is  also good.  my favorite character in the second half, that would be the  scenes in Vietnam, is Animal Mother.  Played by Adam Baldwin.  anybody who  has not seen this movie must make an effort to see it as soon as possible.   the soundtrack is also great, my favorite song being Surfin' Bird by The  Trashmen
B00004SCX6|5.0|Though I like Britney's first CD, I have to say that it is lacking substance.  Songs like &quot;E-mail My Heart&quot; and &quot;Soda Pop&quot; are catchy, but pointless!  Lets face it.  On her new album, the songs have  a point!  &quot;Stronger&quot; talks about proving yourself and increasing  your self confidence, and &quot;Lucky&quot; talks about a young celebrity's  hardships.  Not only do the songs have more substance, but her voice sounds  more refined and matured, like she put more effort and time into the  recording.  There is also more variety.  It reminds me a lot of 'N Sync's  new CD.  I think Britney is maturing and it shows in her music.  If she  keeps this up, she'll be around for years to come! I just hope she starts  writing some of her own material!
0064407667|1.0|The only reasons I can think of to read this book are that it might introduce some new vocabulary, it promotes mechanical engineering, and the curious author bio on the jacket.  Dull characters, dull story.
B00000J7J4|5.0|This CD has been on the charts so long that you'd have to have been locked up in solitary confinement for the past year to have not heard it. Yes, this is a commerial album but the guitar playing is still there for long  time afficionados. No, this is not his best work ever but he has crossed  the threshhold to a new generation of listeners. The mixture of alt-rockers  and hip-hopzterz has given him something he hasn't had since way back in  the day, RADIO AIRPLAY. Unfortunately, like everything else that gets  jammed down our collective throats, you may want to gag if you here  &quot;Smooth&quot; one more time. The production work is flawless, overall  a superb piece of commercial pop that is unlike Carlos Santana who has made  many an artistic album with no RADIO AIRPLAY. This is an introduction album  for the novice and will appeal to a diverse audience from wall street to  cholos, from teeny boppers to gramps but the long time fans will not be  dissappointed because they still have all the old stuff that may be better.  This long time fan  wishes him continued success with his his new found  generation of listeners. Good stuff but seek out his less commerial guitar  work too.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears has paid her dues and her brilliance shines thru on &quot;Oops.&quot; Though still young, Britney's experience as a true show business vet have brought her music to the peak of perfection with this CD.  Listen closely and you'll hear echoes of not only her days as a  Mouseketeer, but also her early experience as one-third of &quot;The New  Shaggs,&quot; the legendary Girl Tribute Group. Reflected in  &quot;Oops!&quot; is everything she learned as a back-up singer (for  artists from Jandek to B.J. Snowden) when she sharpened her vocal chops  before teaming (for one never-released CD) with Lucia Pamela... all of  which prepared Britney... and her listeners... for this latest pure pop  masterpiece. Bravo, Britney! You did it again!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural is absolutely amazing.  In fact, Pearl Jam is absolutely amazing.  I'm glad there is one band that I can always count on to give me a new CD to listen to straight through.  There are too many bad bands that are  really popular these days.  Anyone who really knows Pearl Jam knows they  don't produce music with the intentions of just selling a lot of albums.  To compare Binaural to a track, Last Kiss, that was not originally meant  for the general public is just a joke.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney has done it again with another great album!  &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;, is even better than her debut album and offers an impeccable collection of great songs.  This album is quite a bit different  from the last and is definitely a more mature, edgier, funkier sound for  Britney.  My favorite tracks are; &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;What U See (Is  What U Get)&quot;, &quot;Oops!..I Did It Again&quot;, &quot;Stronger&quot;,  and &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;.  What really impresses me  is that there are no &quot;bad&quot; songs on the album. All of the songs  have catchy beats and are fun to listen too.  Even if you are not a Britney  fan, this album can grow on you quickly!  Go out and buy this album, you  will not regret it!
B000000OEI|5.0|This music composed by Hans Zimmer is some of the best that I have ever heard for a movie soundtrack!  The music underlines the scenes with a grace and a presence that is almost epic in its tone and execution.  This music  could stand on its own without the movie, but the movie can not survive  without it. This is a mark of a great composer.  Great music that is  operatic and graceful that helps convey the films scenes with grace.  Great  work by Hans Zimmer!
6305313687|5.0|Tony Kaye's &quot;American History X&quot; is a work of art. It is one of  the more brilliant stories of our time. However, the story does not make  the movie. The story is simple. The procedure is flawless. Everything in  this film connects so perfectly that it makes me wonder how it did not  achieve more critical appeal. From start to finish, there is neither a  wasted scene, nor poor portrayal of Kaye's idea. Everything fits as it  should. For starters, the movie opens and closes on a beach. Nothing is  unimportant. After close viewing, the first beach is in B&amp;W and the  same beach later is shown in vibrant color. All the while it is accompanied  by a beautiful score that not only shows the dark life of our hero, but  also the beauty of nature and life in essence. When you think about it,  black and white is so ironic for the memories of our pro-Caucasian,  anti-Negro neo-Nazi. That in itself seems to be hidden brilliance. The  dialog is realistic and never overacted. Ed Norton should have<br />been  nominated for best actor for his role in this film. You can see all the  emotions of his character just by looking in his eyes. Edward Furlong  proves to us that he CAN act. Also, AHX has some of the best cinematography  that can be found in these days of flashy camera angles. The cinematography  actually makes sense in portraying the drama and seems necessary in all of  its usage. Where was the academy when this movie was up for nominations?  Apparently kissing up to big whigs like Cameron and Spielberg. Not that I  dislike them, they are just overrated. AMX is WAY underrated. By far one of  the best films of the year. Check it out.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I was sick this weekend, so I got a full dose of the Britney marketing machine on every channel I turned to. Although I don't own the album, watching everything from SNL to First Listen on MTV etc., I have a good  idea how her new release sounds. From a marketing standpoint, the people  involved in promoting this album do a tremendous job. She looked fantastic  on SNL and saturated the MTV airways all day and night with every aspect of  her life.<br />After watching First Listen (for the 3rd time), I couldn't help  but comparing this album to Shania Twain's &quot;Come on Over.&quot; Most  of the songs are good to dance to, sing to etc. Every song starts with a  verse about some boy building up to the chorus and the cycle repeats itself  until the final track. This formula works great because it moves units very  quickly, but after the videos and tours are over, you're left with only a  couple good songs and a bunch that try to recreate the same emotion but  fall short. <br />With all this being said, if you are buying this because you  want to learn Britney's dance moves and sing the songs in your car this  summer, it will be worth every bit of your $15.
0767803434|3.0|To look at &quot;Air Force One&quot; at surface value would do it justice.  There is no deeper meaning, hidden emotion, political statement, or anything along the lines of what makes a movie great.  Above all, it is far  from showing the directing talent Peterson proved in &quot;Das Boot.&quot;   AFO isn't a BAD movie.  It's just not a GOOD movie either.  &quot;Das  Boot&quot; was a classic.  &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot; was a pretty  good movie.  AFO comes in last.  The movie was filled with impressive  action sequences, but that is not the reason people go out to see movies  anymore.  Take &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; for a recent example.  On the  defense for the movie, Gary Oldman does a good job as a POed pro-Soviet  Russian idealist tyring to free a profound Soviet officer from a Russian  prison.  That part is not far fetched.  There are quite a few profound  pro-Soviet factions in Russia.  Many of them have high powers in the  government.  The idea that the next in command leader of one of them can  manage to hijack Air Force One with the mysterious help of the Secret  Service (hmm...maybe his reason for joining them will be in the Special  Edition) is where the plot becomes ridiculous.  As always, Harrison Ford  plays...Han Solo.  How he manages to be one of my favorite actors still  puts me at awe.  Despite its obvious flaws, AFO has its moments of  intensity and remains action-packed throughout.  I wouldn't rush out to buy  this one, but it is definitely a good rental.

6304613199|3.0|After more than three years, Spielberg made a less than impressive return to directing with &quot;The Lost World&quot;. <br />I must admit that I don't consider the original &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; as one of the best films of  the director. It had great setpieces, extremely effective chills and it was  clearly one of the best of its kind. Yet, the film was rather joylessly  realized and this was visible in the final product. This feeling is even  more evident in the sequel. The characters in this one are not only flat,  like in the original, they sometimes succumb to sillyness. The always  excellent Pete Postlethwaite is one of the rare exceptions. It seems that  the director's attitude to the material was more cynical than passionate.  Some reviewers considered that an improvement, but I found the early  entertainments of Steven Spielberg so fantastic and magical, because you  had the feeling that the director believed strongly in his material. This  was the main difference between Spielberg and the others, and this made his  films more than just soulless theme-park-rides. <br />It's not that &quot;The  Lost World&quot; doesn't have its moments. Some of the action scenes are  superbly realized and I liked Janusz Kaminski's photography, but it is  almost impossible to walk out of this film without the feeling, that this  is a movie the world did not need.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I haven't got this cd yet, but I heard all the songs on the net. I think this album is so good. I esp love 'Oops I Did It Again'!  Keep up with the good work Brits!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|In the late 1980's, the Disney animated feature came back with the  wonderful &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Beauty  and the Beast&quot;, an even better film. I think that no animated Disney  film that has been released since then is on par with this one.<br />For many  people, animated movies are still kid movies. Disney proved that this is  false. The characters in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; are  three-dimensional (with the exception of the comic relief Lefou) and the  picture is very often immensely dramatic. The songs, which became more and  more wearing in the following pictures, fit wonderfully in &quot;Beauty and  the Beast&quot; and the images, like the enchanted castle, are  striking.<br />I cannot think of many films of the 1990's that reach (or even  come close) to &quot;Beauty and the Beast's&quot; sense of wonder and  magic. This is truly a film that Disney will long be proud of and that has  earned the term &quot;classic&quot; that the sudio automatically aplies to  all its films.
B00004SCX6|5.0|At first I was a little worried that this cd was not going to live up to it's expectations. But it truly is a very good album. The songs are very well recorded. My favorite is &quot;Don't let me be the last to know.&quot;  I am not disapointed.
B000006OBQ|5.0|This is one of those rare live records where many of the songs are better than the studio versions.  A lot of that credit goes to Count Basie and his great band, but Sinatra is also really giving it that little extra. I'd buy  this CD just for &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot;.  If that isn't one of the  best songs ever written, I don't know what is. This CD has got it all, from  Frank's interplay with the band to his stories to the audience.  If you've  already got a couple of his studio classics (&quot;Songs For Swingin'  Lovers&quot;, &quot;Nice and Easy&quot;, &quot;Come Dance With Me&quot; to  name a few) then you could do a lot worse than to get this.
B00004T8RK|5.0|This new pearl jam album,binaural, has some great songs. It has great songs throughout the album.  It start real great with Break her fall, God's Dice and it doesnt stop with the great songs in the album. I like it the  first time i heard the album, so if anyone likes good music then you will  like this album because Pearl Jam put 13 great songs again
0684833395|5.0|This book is awesome. Heller took the generally depressing and played out theme of war and came up with a hilarious piece of literature that shows both the humor and the horror of war. Characters like Yossarian, Milo, and  Colonel Cathcart make you laugh out loud while characters such as Snowden  amd once again Yossarian make you feel the pain and pressure of living life  day to day not knowing if you'll see the next. The stress of being  constantly in danger has driven the whole squadron of bombers insane but  their antics make for a humorous storyline.  Heller manipulates the device  of absurdity to mold the story into a hilarious chain of events as  Yossarian does everything in his power and some things that aren't within  his power to avoid flying even one more mission.  The characters are well  developed (a new one in each chapter) and each one seems to have his own  absurd, definitive quality that makes him decidedly Helleresque. If you  want a well written novel that will make you laugh out loud, Catch-22 is  your best bet.
B00000K19E|4.0|It was better than Cats, I'd watch it again and again.
B00000253N|5.0|You can loose track of time listening to this CD.  It is a very soothing experience.  I suggest putting it in for a long car ride at night and just let yourself get lost in the tangled web of words that Dylan weaves.  Just  one of his many classic recordings.
6305171769|2.0|I LOVE the Halloween movie series, but Halloween H20 is one of the worst since Halloween 3! Take the following things for example:<br />1. Not even really scary! 2. Almost NO gore at all! 3. It acted if as Halloween 4-6  never happened! 4. The storyline is just stupid! 5. Not even the REAL  Michael Myers....I think!<br />This is very bad! If you still want to see  this, DO NOT buy it....a waste of money! Just rent it or something.
B000000HHE|5.0|This album is really phat.  What producer prince paul did with the samples on this album is simply revolutionary.  The entire album is made up of bits and pieces of sound pasted togethor to in turn create the Sgt. Peppers of  Rap music.  Go buy this and step into the wacky &quot;Daisy Age&quot; that  is De La Soul.
B00004T8RK|3.0|if jim morrison were alive today, he would have maximum repect for eddie veder and the boys from pearl jam.  they have not sold out. each record gets less commercial and like the band crockpot out of roanoke, va, pearl  jam relies more on creative prowess than sheer musical talent. the album  &quot;binural&quot; will not contend w/ britany spears for album sales or  teenage fans, but in 20 years people will still care about the music the  doors, uhh i mean pearl jam is making today.
B000023VR6|5.0|This album is a fierce as was described, I don't regret buying it one bit. Chronic 2001 is everything that it needed to be, and Dre had a tough act to follow after the original Chronic. The beats are SICK, especially  &quot;Xxplosive&quot;. All of the rappers are cool, and you'll be hearing  joints from this album in the clubs and on the radio for years to come. If  you want to turn your party out, bump &quot;Let's Get High&quot; through  your speakers - trust me, the crowd just about lost their minds where I was  at.<br />Let's face it, although it is one love when it comes to music, there  are musical styles based on regions, and Chronic 2001 marks the 'return' of  the West Coast to prominence. Dr. Dre has paved the way for acts like  Xzibit and the other West Coast 'ridahs' to gain more national attention -  and they will no longer be slept on back East. It's all love, cuz the  beauty of this hip hop game right now is all the different flavas that  represent it right now. I will now give thanks to Dre for giving us  somethin to ride to.<br />By the way, the interlude about the mother with the  kid born out of wedlock - that ain't right, but it is HILARIOUS.<br />I also  got the censored version, so I can play it around more people...it's not  that bad to listen to at all. Five stars, baby. Ya better get this album.
B000002G0P|5.0|Sit in a room on your own. Clear your mind and put this album on. Then listen to it from start to finish with no interruptions. It is truly a masterpiece of music. From start to finish each song (whilst being  completly different in feeling to every other song on the album) creates a  story that you can only reflect on once the album has ended. The final 3  songs weave into each other beautifuly and answer all the questions that  have been asked in the previous tracks. It is spine tingling. Nuno  Bettencourt and Gary Cherone in particular make this a special album. With  Nuno's musical arrangement's complimenting Gary's Superb, thought provoking  lyrics you could not wish for more. It is this music that makes me proud to  be a fellow musician. Just buy it, it's superb.
B00004RHZU|4.0|What's cool about Pink is that she wrote most of the songs on this album. As a matter of fact, LaFace records asked her to write after hearing her songwriting ability. She's talented both vocally and as a writer...she can  perform, and she don't look too bad either. BUT, what I respect the most  about her is that she does not try to use a typical suburban image to sell  herself, like Christine Aguilera, Mandy Moore or Britney Spears...rather,  she is true to the music she is doing (which is undeniably R&amp;B) and  adding a little bad-girl funk to it. Yep, &quot;Most Girls&quot; is the  best song on this album (I will not be surprised in the least if this is  the next single), and the beats are killer, like &quot;No Scrubs&quot;  meets &quot;Say My Name&quot;. Did you know that Babyface did &quot;Most  Girls&quot;? If y'all pass this one up, you're missing out. She's fresh,  and she'll be around for a while because she's more than just a mouthpiece.  She writes her own songs...just peep out the last song, &quot;Is it  Love?&quot;...the lyrics are surprisingly raw and real. Ladies (especially  if you're a teenager, and you're dealing with crushes, etc) this album will  not let you down. Let this be the soundtrack to your summer.
B000002KM6|4.0|First off, let me say that the last two or three songs brought this album down from 5 stars.  It was almost there, but the last couple of songs were pretty bad.<br />Aside from that, this album straight rocks.  Eddie's solos  just make you want to crank the volume on the stereo and play air guitar  (Bill &amp; Ted's anyone? :)  David Lee Roth just lets it loose on most of  the tracks on this album.  His hyperactive vocals just mesh so well with  Eddie's axe work...I love it.  I'm hoping the rumors are true that they've  gotten back together...AGAIN!  This is a classic Van Halen album that every  fan should have.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam has hit the musical bullseye with Binaural, its seventh album and sixth studio album.  I think many of us Pearl Jam fans were excited but timid, not knowing if this release would end the drought in a good way.   However, now that the album is out and I've listened to it a few times, I  see that Binaural establishes, as did No Code and Yield, that Pearl Jam is  here to stay and that they are truly great musicians.<br />Let me comment on  my favorite songs:<br />Breakerfall:  Pearl Jam rocks right out of the gate!   Great harmony and fast hard-hitting rhythm make this the best Pearl Jam  album opener since Go from Vs.<br />Light Years:  Yes, Pearl Jam can still  ballad.  Light Years is beautiful without selling out to pop.  Eddie, Mike  and Stone combine the songwriting to make it great.<br />Nothing As It Seems:   As we've heard on the radio, Nothing As It Seems is slow, mysterious, and  delightfully melancholy.<br />Of the Girl:  Eddie accompanies the band in this  mysterious-sounding potential pop hit.  This quick, soft song features the  bass, a few guitar riffs, and a dance-style beat with very little snare  drum.  Is Pearl Jam reaching out to pop music listeners?  Decidedly  different!<br />Rival:  Yes!   Don't be fooled by the intro noise; Rival is  my favorite from the album.  It's slow, but not a ballad.  Good, bluesy  rock and roll with an alternative touch.  Vocal harmony that matches the  rest of the music just perfectly.  If you only have five minutes, listen to  Rival first!<br />Soon Forget:  Cute!  A pretty little ukelele song.  Maybe  this is Eddie's idea of experimentation on this album, but it's way better  than Bugs, Stupidmop, all of the little interludes on Vitalogy, and  basically most everything from Vs., plus the lyrics give an important  message.  When you hear Eddie and his uke, you'll be glad you listened  almost to the end of this album.<br />Parting Ways:  A slow, soft song to  close things out.  Reminds me a lot of Long Road, from the Merkinball CD.   Other than Release, Parting Ways is as good and powerful as any Pearl Jam  album finale so far.<br />I think I need a few more chances to hear Sleight of  Hand, Insignificance, and Grievance before passing judgment on them.  I  must say, though, that this album contains no songs that you wish would go  away, a la WMA and Leash from Vs. and Lukin from No Code.  The album also  contains no profanity, and that's good for everyone.  <br />Some say that  &quot;Binaural isn't Ten,&quot; and that Pearl Jam isn't the same.  You're  right.  Binaural isn't Ten.  Ten was wonderful in 1991 when Pearl Jam was a  brand new band.  Binaural shows an increased maturity in Pearl Jam, which  started with No Code and was even more evident on Yield.  In Binaural we  have musicality and energy: Signs that Pearl Jam isn't done yet!<br />When you  hear Binaural, you'll see that Pearl Jam's music is still definitely  alternative and not punk.  I think Pearl Jam will draw many new fans  through this album.  If you are a PJ fan, obviously you will need this  record.  If you aren't, now is the time to start; Binaural is an awesome  showing for the ever-improving Pearl Jam in the year 2000.
B000002LK1|3.0|Compared with such influential albums as &quot;Some great reward&quot;, DM's commercial breakthrough is a mostly tedious affair. The band doesn't do anything to develop their '80s sound, and &quot;Violator&quot; just  can't compare with the variety of styles and moods of its predecessor  &quot;Music for the masses&quot;. Even worse, Martin seems to have lost his  predilection for provocative lyrics and progressive industrial/techno  elements. The result is a CD with some great hit singles but a fair amount  of uninspired, underdeveloped material that fails to have anything  memorable. &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; with its pseudo-rock sound is pretty  calculated, it's the first of several '90s-missteps into alternative  guitar-rock music. &quot;World in my eyes&quot; is probably DM's weakest  single ever, a very simple song with cheesy drum machines that sound like  something from the late-'70s. &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Blue dress&quot;, and  &quot;Clean&quot; are so-so. The album's forte lies in the great,  radio-friendly hit singles &quot;Enjoy the silence&quot; and &quot;Policy  of truth&quot;, which are among Martin's best songs ever. I recommend you  to buy the CD-singles instead, there are some good remixes and even  previously unreleased material on them. Overall, a moderately enjoyable  album, but as a part of the largely brilliant DM oeuvre it's a  disappointment and it's only worth buying if you want to have all the hit  singles on one convenient disc.
B000000OMP|4.0|Whitesnake, to me, never put out great music. But, this album kicks. The title track opens things up and it sounds just like the old Whitesnake. &quot;Love Ain't No Straner&quot; and &quot;Slow And Easy&quot; are also  good, but point to things to come. The rest of the album is solid. After  this, they went video and really started sounding like all the other hair  metal bands of the 80's.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I admit when I first heard Oops!... on the radio I hated it!  But like most songs that make that first impression, it grew on me!  Now I can't get it out of my head.  Not all songs on this CD are gonna have that effect but  overall it's not bad. <br />Almost all of the songs on here have that  synthesized sound which after a while just made me want to hear Britney and  some background music ONLY without all the bells and whistles thrown  in.<br />I suppose that's why my favorite songs on here are &quot;Don't Let Me  Be The Last To Know&quot; written by Shania Twain and Mutt Lange and  &quot;When Your Eyes Say It&quot; which was written by Diane Warren who can  do no wrong!  These two are sure to be singles.<br />Of her faster songs,  &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Don't Go Knockin' On My Door&quot;, and  &quot;What U See (Is What U Get)&quot; are the best.<br />Britney doesn't have  a very strong voice like say Christina Aguilera, it's more of a whispery  voice...BUT if you like Britney you'll enjoy this CD because you already  knew that!<br />Her songwriting skills need working on for &quot;Dear  Diary&quot; is almost laughable.  The little mini-conversations in between  songs is cute and makes it feel like you're listening to your friend  singing.<br />Britney is a dancer and entertainer.  This CD is songs that she  can dance and entertain with, expect nothing more and you won't be  disappointed!
B00004SCX6|2.0|If you're looking for a more mature, emotionally involved set from Spears, you won't find it here.  Sadly, Oops!...I Did It Again is merely an extension of her debut CD ...Baby One More Time.  Trading up &quot;Hit me  baby one more time&quot; for &quot;I'm not that innocent&quot; is really  the only difference between the two.  All of the songs on the new CD sound  alike, as if a drum machine was left on throughout the entire recording and  Spears just laid down tracks to it.  Her cover of the Rolling Stones'  &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is horrific.  Her vocals ping-pong from orgasmic  to constipated and the result is a breathy, overly synthesized song with  little substance, but will make Mick Jagger richer.  Overall, this  sophomore set is utterly sophomoric, and guaranteed to sell at least 8  million copies.  In the end, Spears will retain her Teen Queen title, which  is a shame, because there are more deserving artists.
1878424114|1.0|What a lot of mass-marketed, spiritual-sounding, sugar-coated platitudes.  You're better off writing your own laws of success.  Don't miss his bestseller SELLING YOUR SOUL FOR FUN AND PROFIT.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam has withstood all the preasure, all the rumors, all the negative karma that can break apart a band which has reached this sort of success.  And now, with Binaural, they prove, once again, that they are one of the  best bands of this time.  Contrary to what the media/new fans want to  believe, it's not the Eddie Vedder show.  This album contains music and  lyrics written by all members of the band, both on as a cummulative and  individual effort.  Track 5, &quot;Light Year&quot;, carries some wonderul  lyrics and has a very different sound to it.  If this were any other band's  First Album, people would be raving.  And yet, it really doesn't matter  what people say, right?
B00000K19E|3.0|I watched Matrix in 1999. Recently in a compilation book of modern horror  and fiction stories, I read a short story by Robert Bloch (author of  Psycho)and was struck by the resemblence between the stories in which the  main character (Harry Jessup) comes home after military service and starts  to think that everything around him is fake but he has no proof: during his  military service there has been a rumor that North America is completely  destroyed after a bombing (one possibility being extra-terrestial invasion)  and to hide the truth an artificial environment is created for the people  who survived and for the soldiers coming home. The book is translated from  English to Turkish, but there is no statement about the original title of  the story. But when translated it becomes something like &quot;You could  have been mistaken&quot;. There are some passages in the story saying (n.b:  I tried to translate from Turkish as I don't have the original text)   &quot;in an environment where you don't have a reference to identify the  truth, how can you say that everything that surrounds you is real?&quot; or  when Harry says &quot;they destroyed the whole country and took control  over it and created an illusion  that nothing has changed. People living in  that environment would be so accustomed to live their fake lives that they  wouldn't notice that difference as I couldn't notice it myself&quot;.  Sounds familiar no? If there is any reference in the screenplay or in the  movie about Robert Bloch or if any reviewer has noticed this fact earlier,  I apologize. On the other hand, the visual effects and the artistic  direction were excellent: there is no doubt about it.
B00003CXDU|3.0|&quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; starts off weak, but gains more and more momentum until by the end, you're actually interested in how it turns out. There are some very clever skewerings of &quot;Star Trek&quot; pretzel logic, and the  aliens (especially their leader) are hilarious. I especially loved Tony  Shalhoub as the almost comatose &quot;engineer&quot;. But the biggest  problem with this movie is that its lead is played by Tim Allen. This man,  along with Ben Affleck, embodies the death of charisma. Horrible,  absolutely horrible performance, all mugging and smirking. Give me Shatner  any day -- at least his hamming is delivered with a wink. Still,  &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; is definitely worth checking out. You can't do  worse than Tim Allen, but you can do a lot worse with a sci-fi flick (like  &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;).
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden's self-titled debut album takes you completely through the emotional spectrum, and their second album is no exception.  The music has evolved so much, from the peppy but deep Affirmation, to the sweet slow  song I Knew I Loved You, to Crash and Burn which is about being there for  your friends, to the upbeat feel-good The Best Thing, to the sad but  touching Two Beds and A Coffee Machine, to the obsessive and amazing  Gunning Down Romance.  All right if I don't stop now I'm going to start  listing every track... I never skip tracks on this album, and if you are  capable of being moved by music then you will love this album.
0790731509|5.0|And I really mean it. They used to show this film often on the Superstation. When I was twelve, I watched it; the next time it came on, I taped it, and watched it probably more than 50 times over the next few  years (I didn't know for a long time that the TV version has several scenes  cut out for length, so getting it on video was a new revelation). What is  it about &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; that is so moving? Well, it starts with  Paul Newman's performance. Lucas Jackson is one of the most psychologically  complex characters in the history of cinema, and Newman, criminally denied  the Oscar for this film, makes him seem larger-than-life without saying  much. Everything that comes out of his mouth is a revelation. The Christ  allusions, which are fittingly done, heighten the sense of injustice that  Luke is being slowly crucified by the lawmen, simply because he won't bend  to their rules. On the surface, Luke seems self-destructive and ignorant,  but in repeated watchings of the film, it becomes apparent that Luke is  answering to a call that is bigger than the prison, bigger than the bosses,  bigger than the law itself. I could go on and on about the myriad other  ways in which this film is perfect, but why bother? I only get 1,000 words.  Suffice it to say that this is the movie that makes George Kennedy, of all  people, seem noble. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM. The only flaw: I grew up in  Georgia, and I can assure you that it is not filmed where it is set. Looks  more like the Central Valley of California to me.
6304994540|5.0|Well, not only the plot, but everything just seems to catch the gold in this film. The characters are the weirdest type ( Especially John Turturro as the violet bowler-Jesus), and the scenes are created brilliantly. How  can one enjoying quality psycho-comedies not like this? The best movie of  1998-1999.
B00004T8RK|5.0|(...) Binaural isn't an album about using whatever sound iscurrently popular to make a commercial success that will be forgottenas soon as styles change.  It's not about white rage, or electronica, or radio-friendly alterna-pop.  It's about what Pearl Jam has stood for since Ten: Rock and Roll with a purpose.<br />And rock Binaural does; from the introductory scream of &quot;Breakerfall&quot; to the manic Stop/Go pacing of &quot;Evacuation&quot; Binaural shows that yes, Pearl Jam can rock just as hard as any group out there today.  But not just any group can craft songs that have more purpose than to make a lot of noise, and it's here that Binaural shines.  Be they fast-paced rockers or slower ballads, the songs of Binaural all show a remarkable sense of meaning; whether their subject is love, hate, loss, or materialism, there's definitely something Pearl Jam is trying to say in each song.<br />Sonically, Pearl Jam has never sounded better, either; Matt Cameron does an excellent job on drums, making what was previously (besides a few exceptional tracks) background noise an important and truly valuable addition to the band's sound.  And the songs themselves are simply excellent; once again Pearl Jam shows themselves to be rock's most dynamic band, going from the up-tempo rocker &quot;Evacuation&quot; to the much slower &quot;Light Years&quot;, and from the angst and vengeance-driven &quot;Rival&quot; to the almost meditative &quot;Sleight Of Hand&quot; to Eddie Vedder's ukelele-driven &quot;Soon Forget&quot;.<br />In the end, Binaural stands out as a powerful and meaningful Rock album, the likes of which has not been seen in many years.  It's about Pearl Jam doing what they do best, making excellent rock and roll long after the death of rock and roll, and it's about songs concerning things that matter.  It's Binaural: listening with both ears.
6303213650|4.0|There's always some little details in the Coen brothers' movies that separate them form trash, and, instead, make them genious. Sometimes the line can be very small. <br />All in all, this movie was classified as some  sort of dissapointment at the time of it's rlease. Sure, it can be called  clumsy or clicheéd. I mean, the plot doesn't seem so stunning at first. But  there are again some little things that make this movie so brilliant. It  can be seen as a critisation for the over-commecilaity, but more than  anything iti is a fars. and a dam funny movie. Casting is also brilliant (  for example, watch Jennifer Jason-Leigh!), and the photography - oh the  photography!  Actually , if anything elese doesn't attract you in their  movies, you'll have admire the certain freshness there is n the scenes.  Credits to the camerawork. Plus; the lot is also at least a bit out of  sight. Yumm...
B00000J7RZ|1.0|I had very high hopes for this album.  I really liked the singles &quot;If You Had My Love&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot;.  The whole album is generated with horrible beats and too many corny songs.  I think that  Jennifer has a great voice, but this album did not work for me.  I really  appreciated that this album incorparated latin rythms in it.  This could've  been a good album, but it was simply overproduced.  This cd, in my opinion,  is not worth buying.  If you like any of her songs, I advise you to buy the  singles.
0553288105|5.0|Asimov describes a world 70 years into the future (over 100 years into the future when he wrote it).He uses simple science terms and creates a situation where people have unlimited free power sources and no longer have  to work.  All man kind is now in some sort of science or technology.  A  bright young scientist descovers a flaw in the power source, but the public  is too content to listen to the &quot;half crazed&quot; ideas of an  apocolypse.  Asimov exposes man's nature to beleive only what he wants to.   Asimov also deals with a paralel universe and to a colony on the moon.  His  choice of charecters, setting, and plot are brilient to the upmost.  This  will not suprise you if you have read Asimov, but if you haven't, here is a  nice sized book to start of with (293 pages).  If you enjoy this book you  may also enjoy &quot;Nightfall,&quot; by Asimov.  Issac Asimov has long  been hailed as the master of fiction and this is just one example. Enjoy.
0679600655|5.0|Many people dismiss this book as nothing but pervertedness and filthiness. They fail to see the beauty of this tale. This book deserves literary merit, for it's a brave masterpiece. Not, as one prosecutor put it,  &quot;dirt for dirt's sake.&quot;<br />This book should not be seen as a piece  of work advertising pornography, but rather as a mere attack against  industrialization. Perhaps Lawrence, through the tale of Lady Chatterley  and her lover, was trying to bring a message across about industry  (Clifford Chatterley's coal mine) and the working class (significantly the  gamekeeper, Mellors). But, of course, we can't overlook the endless romance  between Lady Chatterley and her lover, for it is what this story is about.  <br />The fact that it contains that little four-lettered Anglo-Saxon word  that begins with an &quot;F&quot; is more reason why this book deserves  literary merit, for it is one of the first and foremost important works of  literature to contain it. Now, of course, it is hard to find a book, a  movie, or a song without that famous word. <br />If D. H. Lawrence should be  remembered a thousand years from now, it should be for writing this story.  He was a very courageous, very daring person to have written it. This taboo  of a story is one that will stay in the reader's mind forever.<br />(Note: If  you are to read this book, I'd recommend the unexpurgated version.)
B00004SCX6|5.0|First, I have to admit I really didn't like her when &quot;Baby..one more time&quot; came out.  I thought it was &quot;cheese&quot;!  But when this album came out and I bought it on May 16.  I was so amaze!I said &quot;What  an incredible album&quot;!I really can't believe it.She did it again!The  best song on the album is &quot;Don't let me be the last to know&quot;  Which was written by Shania Twian and her husband.Next would probably be  &quot;lucky&quot; and &quot;what you see is what you get&quot;I mean the  whole album is just so great....so if you have the album already good for  you!

B00004T8RK|1.0|hands off! <br />something went wrong... i bought all pearl jam albums.. till now! &quot;Yield was weak, but &quot;Binaural&quot; is nothing else than bad pop music. one hour &quot;tralalalala&quot;. eddies voice is incredibly  weak and i couldn't name one single surprise or evolution.my advice:hands  off!
B000002GOZ|5.0|This album is one of my favourites. Bryan's interpretation of his well known songs with excellent orchestra ... yes ... it's the best. I just hope, that in the future BA will put some his other songs (on double album)  unplugged with same excellent orchestra.
0385484518|1.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is the tale of a &quot;dying man talking to a living man, telling him what he should know.&quot; It's a compendium of one man's life's lessons, dispensed by the sainted Morrie in his effort to &quot;walk  that final bridge between life and death and narrate the trip.&quot; <br />My  question is this--is Morrie's advice of any real value? Are his utterances  practicable to the point that Mr. Albom has the right to pass them off as  gospel? Is Morrie's message, just because it's right for him, necessarily  right for the rest of mankind? If not, then it's presumptuous and pushy for  Morrie's disciple to attempt to foist ideas about how to live on the rest  of us. <br />In America, self-improvement instruction has long been the  publisher's cash cow. It's notoriously profitable. People want to be told  how to live. Consequently, there's always someone like Mitch around to  provide a map of the road to happiness, to show us the ropes of life, to  provide the keys to fulfillment and self-actualization. &quot;Tuesdays With  Morrie&quot; is one more bag of balm in a smarmy genre that won't go away.  What makes Morrie a little different is that the central character lives  and breathes, and, to make matters more heart-rending, we're permitted to  accompany him on his journey to the Valley of Death. It's the perfect  setup. Dying man's words reek of authenticity; author uses them to bathe  the reader in his own shame. The result? Catharsis! Albom is saying, look,  here's a guy who's dying. Instead of crying in his beer and fearfully  living out his last days in self-pity, he's willing to give everything to  teach you barbarians the real lessons of life. And what are you doing?  Living your lives in the same shallow, unfocused, materialistic way you  always have. It's shameful. C'mon, get with the program. Listen to Morrie.  Live as if today were your last. Do unto others. Can't buy me love. Stop  and smell the roses. Love one another. Make a commitment. All you need is  love.<br />Of course these are good lessons, and of course they can provide  meaning and purpose in our lives, but the book itself (like most self-help  books) is something of a sham. It's essentially a re-packaging of things we  already know or things we've heard over and over, from every do-gooder from  Roy Rogers to Mr. Rogers. And if we don't believe them now we're not going  to learn them just because a dying man in a twenty dollar book whispers  them to us through a wet hankie, no matter how sincerely they're uttered.  If we one day choose to apply these lessons, we will have to learn them  first--through hard knocks, personal discovery and, as Morrie did, through  personal suffering--not via the transparent artifices of a maudlin, poorly  written best seller. <br />One can admire the selfless character of Morrie  Schwartz. He's humane. He sets a good example. He fights the good fight and  does his best under trying circumstances. He appears to care more for  others than he does for himself. And I have no quarrel with the bromides  his devoted apprentice is selling. Most likely the world would be a better  place if we all could find it in our hearts to live by Morrie's code. And  perhaps we'd all be happier. But it is Albom's presumption that, like him,  we all need gather 'round to bask in the wisdom of Morrie the Master that  raises my hair. May I please live my life myself? May I find life's meaning  for myself? May I learn to feel the joy and pain of living on my own,  instead of yielding up the pleasure of making life's discoveries to the  Mitch and Morrie machine? <br />Truly, if Morrie's message and memory meant so  much to Mr. Albom, he would have marketed his dead teacher's platitudes the  way the Gideons market Bibles: voluminously, ubiquitously, and for FREE!
B00000J7RZ|1.0|I was very disappointed in this CD.  I'd seen Jennifer's obvious talents in dancing and acting and thought that this CD would be worth a listen.  Was I wrong!  Her voice is very weak and flat, and the terrible  (over)production does nothing to help.  Surely Jennifer will realize this  and go back to acting.  Stick to what you know, Jennifer.
B00000J7J4|3.0|Enough has been said about the music on this CD.  If you plan to listen to Supernatural on good audio equipment, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.  The musical sound spectrum compressed.  This is not problem if you're listening  in your car or on so-so audio equipment, but on a good audio system it will  take only about 15 seconds of listening and you'll realize the highs and  lows are clipped.
6305064490|5.0|A man is prevented form committing suicide by an elderly angel, who takes him back through his life to show him the good he's done. Undoubtedly one of the most popular movies ever made, this majestic, heartwarming fantasy  is greeted with enthusiasm with each new generation. The public obviously  adores Capra's &quot;human touch&quot; and the performances are all  memorable down to Stewart's kids (Every time a  bell rings, an angel gets  his wings!) Beulah Bondi is typically natural as Ma Bailey, Lionel  Barrymore hatefully crusty Mr. Potter; even the cameo by Sheldon Leonard  stands out. As Mary Bailey, Donna Reed was never more lovely or appealing,  and Gloria Grahame is fun as Violet the tart. The scenes we remember are  many: young George getting smacked on the ear by the pharmacy owner, Mary  and George falling into the pool; the victrola and &quot;moonlight and  rocks&quot; scene. This holiday classic has the distinction of being the  favourite work of both Capra and Stewart!
0792842723|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and I am convinced. This is the best Bond movie hands down. The action is great, the women are both believable and the locations amazing. The story is very good, too, just so long as you  pay attention. Dont miss this one. Bond has never been so good.
0780021150|5.0|A harrowing melodrama about a psychotic child murderer who's brought to justice by the Berlin underworld. Lorre's performance is unforgettable in this riveting and frightening film which is surprisingly cinematically  dazzling for an early talkie. An unmistakable classic whose oddities are  trivial; brilliantly staged, this film is part social melodrama and part  satire and its got visual excitement, pace, brilliance of surface and  feeling for detail.
B0000029DD|4.0|Poor Jeff Buckley. Will he ever know the true effect his music had on people?<br />Is he smiling down upon us, satisfied that he lived for a great purpose? The great purpose being to record &quot;Grace&quot;? <br />We won't  know until we ourselves join him, but to entertain ourselves in the  intervening years, we have Buckley's debut to keep us company. <br />It may as  well have been sung from heaven. The voice- oh, the voice- filtered through  an angels cloud, it bends and snaps, and sparkles and shines through 10  tracks- 2 of which are covers. The Buckley- written pieces are certainly  extraordinary. Complex, moody, and subtle, there was nothing this  perfectionist couldn't do with his voice and guitar.<br />Listen to the lead  guitar line of 'Grace', and its simple, mathematical beauty. That may sum  the whole album up. Syncopatic, yet mathematical beauty. <br />Damn the river  that took the man.
0790744759|5.0|In one of her most beloved roles as Esther Smith, we see an unusually thin 22 year-old Judy Garland. A truly wonderful slice of Americana which takes place in 1904 during the St. Louis World's Fair, this movie has colourful performances all around while Minnelli's direction is inspired and the Technicolor photography by George Folsey is great. Judy's &quot;look&quot; in this film was created by eccentric make-up artist Dotty Ponedel who gave Dietrich her exotic look; Ponedel altered Judy's face by raising her eyebrows and making her already huge eyes even larger looking via the use of white liner; her hairline was tweezed and with rouge, her mouth was given a fuller lower lip! Perennial Garland classics include: &quot;The Trolley Song&quot;, &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot;, &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; and of course, the title tune.
0571179924|5.0|This book (like usual) is different from the  movie Casino.  This book is worth reading since this adds some more realism than the movie did.  Another great mafia book by Pileggi and worth the price you paid for it.  Great if you like the Italian mafia and Las Vegas.
0061002747|5.0|This is a great book for both children and adults. The rest of my 6/7th grade class and I recently read it and it was great! It is close to impossible to predict the great ending! I am a big fan of Agatha Christie's  and if I could give her book more stars, I would!
0140277447|5.0|First off, Chang depicts the forgotten battles of WWII incredibly vivid and frank.  Very few books have made me stop reading for a moment out of sheer emotion; this is one, however.  What makes the happenings of Nanking  so horrible is that Japan has never admitted any wrong doing, even to this  day.  I have been living in Japan for the past year and can say that only  one person I have come across knows the truth about the rape.  Let us not  hold a heavy thumb on Japan...everyone has their atrocities...The United  States and slavery as well as atrocities in Viet Nam committed by US  soldiers, China and millions starved because of Mao and his  &quot;agricultural advances,&quot; Stalin and the 20,000,000 plus starved  and murdered fellow countrymen, the Nazi regime, Pol Pot and Cambodia.  The  list goes on and on.  The difference is, of all the examples, Iris Chang  examines in detail how easily such a massacre has been forgotten.  Of the  above examples, they were either 1) not governmentally implemented, or 2)  the countries have admitted and apologized for their faults (with the  possible exception of the Khmer Rouge). Iris Chang...thanks for such an  informative and important read.
B000002AGN|5.0|If I said to get this album for &quot;Take Five&quot; only, it'd be a huge disservice to one of the best jazz albums I've ever heard. This is a classic and deserves to be in everyone's music collection.<br />Brubeck is on  fire on the piano and Desmond is silky and smooth on the saxophone. Wright  works the bass to excellence and Morello shines on the drums.<br />From the  beginning notes of &quot;Blue Rondo A La Turk&quot;, to the last cut  &quot;Pick Up Sticks&quot;, it's a mesmerizing experience. &quot;Strange  Meadow Lark&quot; is beautiful. Then there is &quot;Take Five&quot;, heard  countless times everwhere, but still sounds as fresh as ever.<br />A timeless  album that will give years of listening pleasure. Enjoy.
0316920045|5.0|The sheer size of this book is enough to give many people pause.  The scope turns out to be even greater than expected, and Wallace's brilliant style occasionally reaches a transcendent, joyful place in the mind.   A  full review would be longer than most novels, and in fact Wallace has been  the subject of countless college papers since this book hit the shelves.   All I can say is you have to read it to understand.   Often compared to  Nabakov, Wallace is in fact more the next step - the love child of Ellis,  DeLillo, Barth, and Pynchon.  The only real problem with the book is that  it may be impossible for him to surpass it.   The characters encompass  almost every possible walk of life.  Young tennis prodigies, drug addicts  both recovering and active, political intrigue, and tortured artists only  begin to scratch the surface.  Elliptical in plot, anticlimatic,  infuriating, wretched and sublime, the book takes you on a ride, which is  something not many books can manage with today's cynical audience.   Don't  go into this book with any assumption.  Whatever you may be expecting, even  based on reviews, is off the mark.   I cannot recommend this book enough.
0780626478|2.0|Story of a couple (Christopher Walken, Sissy Spaceck) who, in 1963 go into a HUGE bomb shelter to hide from nuclear bombs, but their really weren't any. Thirty five years later their son (Brendan Fraser)goes out into the  REAL world and meets a very beautiful girl (Alicia Silverstone) and her gay  friend Troy (Dave Foley). Some parts are funny, some parts lag. Christopher  Walken and Dave Foley are what makes this movie very funny, especially  Walken. I liked it alot but, hey, just not may favorite.
0449911357|5.0|I went into this book without expecting much.  However, Flagg captivated me.  This book is about more things than I could mention here.  Racism, aging, lesbianism, charity, southern poverty, etc.  Flagg's subtle yet open  treatment of Idgie and Ruth's relationship is beautiful.  The easy flow of  her writing will make you believe the improbable without a second thought.    This book is accessible enough to be enjoyed by almost anyone.  For those  seeking depth, don't worry, it's there.   This book will be around for a  long time.
630516889X|5.0|Can I say more. If you have not seen it, then you MUST get it. Highest recomendation...
B00003CXDV|5.0|I always liked Star Trek and I really loved this movie. It's funny, good-hearted, and often quite touching. But I was surprised to see that my 7-year old son (who has never seen Trek and only saw the latest Star Wars)  absolutely loves it too. He doesn't realize it's a spoof! So, I guess it  works as a straight adventure as well. There are a few mildly suggestive  jokes (and Sigourney Weaver's cleavage) but generally it's fine for kids  even if they don't understand the levels of parody. My son watches it  almost every day and enjoys it much more than Star Wars: Episode I.
0783230621|5.0|This movie was really good when I didn't expect it to be. It is one of the best disaster movies of the 90s. I think the reason why it was so good is because it had charaters that you cared about. As well, the movie focused  on the different threats that arise from the volcano. It's not just the  lava that you need to worry about. I guess what I am trying to say is that  this is a movie with great action and brains.

B00004RFFM|4.0|I thought this was going to be really cheesy, but it was not that bad. It was a lot of fun to watch. If you are a fan of these types of movies then you must check it out.
B00004SYWZ|4.0|I actually ordered this CD from the Netherlands two weeks before it was available on Amazon.  I was impressed with the new sound and that A-ha has one again re-invented itself.  Scoundrel Days is still the best CD in my  opinion.  Thus 4 stars.
0440178002|5.0|I first read this book in the summer of 1975, and it was the first Clavell book I had ever touched. I have bought several others on the strength of my appreciation for Shogun alone, though they have almost all earned similar  kudos.  The story is incredibly detailed; the threads and points of view  disparate but handled with fantastic finesse and attention to interlocking  them into each other; and the ending a surprise (to me at least), but with  a feeling of massive inexorability about it that provides fulfillment and  complete closure.  If you're looking for good, absorbing, exciting, and  entertaining literature with which you can settle down for several hours,  and are willing to have your eyes opened by one of the best introductions  I've ever encountered to a truly non-Western culture, please give this book  a try.
B000007OY0|5.0|I just want to state that Maltin`s Guide review misses the point completely. This film is not overlong; every minute is needed to build its momentum, it is not predictable or hollow. On the contrary, it is a  surprisingly probing, deep,  view of the tenacity of the human spirit and  the value of friendship. Compassionate and deeply rewarding. Barring Renee  Falconetti in &quot;The passion of Joan of Arc&quot;, few actors have  topped the moving performances of Robbins and Freeman.  &quot;Redemption&quot; it is, indeed.
B00004STPT|4.0|Sure, Hans Zimmer heavily leaned on Holst for his score and probably a lot of other pieces as well (just listen to James DeMaers 'Two World Concerto' with R. Carlos Nakai/The Black Lodge Singers/Canyon Symphony Orchestra),  but what does it matter? All classical composers have stolen from each  other, as do all modern composers. Important is: it is great music and a  totally appropriate companion to a fantastic film. Not since 'Dances with  Wolves' have I come across such a perfect fit of music and film. Wile  listening to the CD over and over again, I really can visualise the film  scenes again. And: yes, of course: both films and their music play heavily  to our emotions - the hero,seeking freedom and justice, longing for peace  and a place where he is 'at home'. I can't get enough - at least not for  the time being.
B000002R67|2.0|Actually, &quot;lyrics&quot; is probably not the right word. The two most offensive songs (&quot;Winds of Change&quot; and &quot;The Black Plague&quot;) are spoken-word...but they're hardly poetry, so that's not  the right term either.<br />I'm sorry, folks, but I just can't erase the image  of Spinal Tap when Bourdon starts reading some fourth grader's melodrama  about the peasants outside the castle walls.  I did get the point (so  please don't accuse me of being one of the rich holed-up in the castle  starving for fear of confronting the winds of change), but it sure is  painful listening.   Give me poetry, give me melody (&quot;The Story of Bo  Diddley&quot; is among my favorites), or give me the evening news - I'll  take anything over this.<br />Do feel free to accuse me of letting one foul  note ruin my experience of an entire album.  There's a lot of talk here  about this being a &quot;theme&quot; album, which would seem to me to  require the listener to consider it as a whole.  I'm sorry to say that as  far as this listener is concerned, two bad apples spoiled the bunch.  <br />&quot;Bring out your dead&quot; indeed, and get rid of some of this  chaff instead of dressing it up and calling it &quot;concept&quot;.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I was really looking forward to Britney's new album, because her first one was excellent as far as I was concerned.  Her second album just does not hit the mark.  The songs from what I could tell were trhown together just  to get her second album out while she was still hot.  The title song in my  opinion &quot;Opps I did it again is about the only decent cut out of the  whole CD.  I just wish I had not wasted my money on the whole CD, and had  waited for the title single.  Take my word for it this CD is really bad.  A  former Britney fan.
