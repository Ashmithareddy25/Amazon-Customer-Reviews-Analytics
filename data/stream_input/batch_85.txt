B00RRURTZK|5|oh my goodness!  I ordered this according to my daughter's measurements (which was two sizes above her normal size; she's a 6 but we got a 10) and it fits perfectly.  BEAUTIFUL. I even contacted the seller to have is customized and it is perfect. Great value.  Great fit.
B005GYGEXC|5|I love the fit and feel of these pants; I'm not a fan of other brands' material, feels too &#34;polyester&#34; for me. They're sturdy and can withstand frequent workouts and washes. Sometimes, I'll pair them with boots and go out with friends!
B00JPS6YMG|3|They're okay, but my pins still spin around on my hat.
B00BFUFIZQ|5|It is a nice swimsuit with right sizing and suitable price, also the color is exactly same as picture. It is great for water parks.
B00L3X23F8|5|My husband has a 33-inch waist and the 32-inch in these shorts fit perfectly. The waist isn’t exactly stretchy but it is soft and has some give to it. The length of the shorts depends on a man’s height. My husband is 5’11” and the hem is right above the knee. The pockets are great – 6 in all. The front flap pockets fits his cell phone. The charcoal plaid color is muted and not at all brash. The fabric is lightweight and breathable, very comfortable.
B003ITAFMS|4|Nice enough kit. Got here really fast. All components listed in the description were included. The rod is long enough to clean a 20\\" barrel. The only thing I'm not happy about is that the threads don't appear to be 8-32. They are finer and need a longer neck. This means that I can't use my other brushes and probably can't replace the ones furnished with the kit. Plenty good enough for a field kit.
B0093EH03E|5|This tie (navy blue) looks just like it does in the picture.  It is quite slender.  Overall the quality is great and you can't beat the price.  I also like the packaging it came in.
B0081TES6O|3|Great bathing suit.<br />Nice fit.<br />The only problem is that the neck strap is not adjustable.<br />At the side view you can see a good portion of my chest looking like its about to pop out.<br />Besides that, the bathing suit fits lovely.
B00KFRJN1K|5|Love this skirt! I am 6 mos preg and I and a 5'2, size 4-6 ,120-130lbs, I ordered a medium, since some of the reviews said it ran small. The medium fits perfect.
B003XAFK7W|5|We ordered these shorts in khaki and blue. They look nice, and are comfortable. The product did get delivered quickly. I did not notice that french toast sizes are not exactly like most other brands of clothing my son wears, so they were tighter than I would of liked for the beginning of the school year. But that was a fault of my own for not checking the sizing chart.<br />I would purchases these shorts again next year.
B000MX3R6O|5|i just love this bra! Great support!!
B007XHIRV2|2|Had to give them away.
B0008MFDEI|2|This bra is very small. I wear a small size, and got this in a medium. Even a medium size was a bit too tight and uncomfortable.
B009MB7YFW|5|This hat got me so many girlfriends.
B007W2R37C|5|I own quite a few of Sakkas pencil skirts and love them.  They are a quality skirt at a good price.  As I have found with all of Sakkas skirts you need to order a larger size than you normally would because they run a little small.  There is some stretch in them but I would still suggest ordering a size larger and I think you will be much happier.  The skirt lays well on my curves and with the stretch in the skirt it hugs me giving me that hourglass look I want.  The stretch in the fabric also allows you to move without binding making this a very comfortable skirt to wear.<br /><br />As an Amazon Prime member this skirt and almost all of Sakkas skirts are qualified for free two day shipping.  My order arrived on time in perfect shape.
B005I33OAM|5|Keeps my hands warm and dry when I am out using the snow blower.
B0031B1NYW|5|I first read this wrong and thought it was larger. But when I received it in the mail it is really made very well. I'm so glad I ordered it.
B004IYIN1C|4|I'd have given it another star but for the fact that briefs without a door for peeing require a bit of getting used to—with these, one has to pull a leg hole over to do the peeing. One wonders about the anatomy of the designer.
B004Q2O0XQ|2|Cheap and junkY with paint chips flaking off.  Picture is a misrepresentation.  It looks like it came from a garbage bin.
B00LO2XGOU|5|comfy, good quality fabric; fits loose, as expected.  Very nice jams that wash up well.
B000BSW6G2|5|I can't find these in stores as readily, so I am stocking up against them not being made any longer. Not sure if they are discontinuing, but I live in these. I have a drawer full of a dozen, and a few 2-packs to spare.<br />This product works for me, all I can say.
B0046EHFWM|2|Way to small for a larger busted woman. I'm a D, and it just did NOT work. I liked it overall, but it didn't fit.
B00KQY4LW8|5|Great leggings.  Good price.  Just what I wanted.
B000L9X714|5|These socks hold up extremely well, they are very comfortable, and durable.   They run pretty true to size, I am a size fifteen and they fit me well.   Overall, they are a good value, and are some of the best socks I have ever owned.   I ended up buying three more packages, and am hoping that they will continue making them as I will certainly continue buying them.
B00MEEK942|5|Good fit
B00A76MXBG|5|I got white and feel like I'm wearing a drs coat.  Going to try to dye it. Quality is great.  I'm a size 2 and bought a small.
B00BR41QF6|3|I ordered this because I wanted the summery bright yellow on the front [as pictured], but received one with a very dark blue on the front.  I feel very disappointed, but afraid to order another and get the same blue instead of what I want. I'm keeping it, though, because it's very comfortable.
B006JCJCPW|5|Came fast
B001FSP2NG|5|Great product. :-)
B0045EEJCW|5|Pretty cool truck style hat.  Get compliments on it all the time.  Quality is ok, may not last as long as some of my others which I have had for 3-4 years.  Depending on usage, may last 2?  But cool enough and cheap enough not to discourage me from keeping it.
B00GRIQI6E|5|Excellent trabsaction
B003SQTBKI|5|This a good magnifier that gives clear, distortion free magnification of small print and details.  It is best for desk work or putting in purse or in checkbook.  It is a bit thick & heavy to put in a thinner wallet carried in hip pocket or breast coat pocket.  Although credit card length & width dimensions it is relatively thick as it has an optical glass/plastic lens not a thin plastic fresnel lens.  It does give at least a 2X magnification with very excellent depth of field so distance you hold it from item being magnified and distance from your eye have much wider range of clear magnification than many of the cheaper, very thin, fresnel plastic type magnifiers which is a big plus.<br /><br />It is of relatively heavy weight construction that should last for years, but may be prone to breakage if dropped sharply on hard surface.<br /><br />Note it does NOT have a built in light so cannot be used in darkness or very low light situations, but is not advertised having light feature or as being capable of being used in extremely low light situations.<br /><br />The lens being glass or optical plastic is prone to smudges and finger prints but wipes clean easily with any soft cloth or material.  The little leatherette case is a MUST for storing this magnifier as lens will scratch if it is not used.<br /><br />If you want a good sturdy little handy magnifier for use in decent light that will last for years and you are willing to pay about 2-3X what the little thin magnifiers will cost then this is the product for you (and me, as I use it at my desk for reading the \\"fine\\" print on documents and instructions on items/bottles).
B003DC8UBI|2|their not what i expected them to be
B005LPE7W6|5|i love this patch. i had one on my other backpack, but recently got a new one and decided i needed a new patch to go along with it.  I go to a very conservative college and everyone always either asks me about it or is unnerved by it, which makes me happy. anyway, if you're a medical examiner or looking to freak out your peers, buy this.
B00BMT470C|5|This bathing suit is just like the photo is beautiful and very discreet appropriated for a beach party in touch.<br />Anna Karina
B00HET8VRE|5|My Wife Loved It
B00EDIFKVO|5|This set is great for the price!!!
B002YQU6KC|3|The extenders fit our brand of onesie (Carter's), and they work great at lengthening the onesie for our tall 22 month old. I want to give it 5-star rating, however the snaps came off and broke really easily after just 1-3 uses on each 4 of the extenders that fit Carters. I am returning them for a refund (they don't do replacements). I appreciate that they are refunding me. And I will order the product again and see if it just happen to be a defect of the specific extenders we got...
B00HSQKES2|5|The perfect casual raincoat! I had tried on several other brands, but I needed more room in the chest than other brands provided. This jacket is roomy enough in the bust without looking huge everywhere else.
B002SE53FI|4|This Is one very beautiful and well fitting bra.  It's so comfortable I almost can't believe I have it on.  Nice fit, adjustment in the front where the belong.  All around a perfect bra.  If I could have one wish it would be that it came in s 38A.  But as it is, it's a perfect new home for my 'hooters'. dianefromcarroll@yahoo.com
B0067FKBDI|5|Perfect
B00EMB67UU|5|I would recommend this bikini to EVERYONE!!!!! SOOOOOOO cute. And high waisted is really in right now. The top is a pushup with quite thick padding. I'm a 32B and the top made me look really busty. LOVE IT. Well made and it was BETTER in person than what I expected for a cheaper swimsuit. WOULD DEFINITELY BUY from this company again. If you are skeptical because of the price don't be. You will be pleased I guarantee it!
B000Y8D54G|5|best denims i ever purchased. been buying them for years.pants even have a crease in them. will  continue to purchase.
B00BPXZMP4|5|I love the weight and the texture of the fabric, as well as the cut.  It was my mistake buying the too-large size.  I was experimenting.  I like being cozy but not excessively warm.  These pajamas fit the bill.
B0081BYJP2|5|well , these shirts are amazing but they are a little small so im happy with the XL for my hubby . he'll be very happy with it ! great service ! Thank you !
B001KJMS7I|5|It fitted my Daughter great and she loved it. I will get some more when I get back to work. They are great.
B00R2C1DM8|1|Not great for big boobs
B009TB13EI|5|Wonderful beanie! It's well made, definitely thicker than other beanies I have had.<br />Can't beat the color either, it's beautiful!
B00SXRPA2U|5|Its wonderful, so soft and stretchy. Fast delivery!!!
B0045JAJIK|5|Totally satisfied.
B00HY4DK1G|5|It's really good n it looks beautiful
B008D88742|5|This headband is great as it does not slip during work outs or running!  It also looks great and it goes with almost anything.
B005CSOGRI|3|Compared to similar Nike pants, these pants are way too long and baggy.  My sons wear 29 and 30\\" waist pants and 30\\" length and the small was too long and if you used the strings to pull in the waist the top half of the pants were really baggy. The price is great and quality seemed good but they are going back.
B002ED6HMQ|5|So far so good. I was wary of ordering these, but when I got them and tried them out, I don't know how I survived so long without them.
B00CSYREPK|5|This shirt fits as expected and looks great.  My son loves the graphic and feel of the shirt.
B00EFYTB8O|5|Great outfit if you can sport it with confidence as it's form-fitting and very revealing.
B00BZU5HA2|2|I'm not a large woman - 5' 7&#34; and 150 lbs.  I did just have a baby so my hips may have widened a bit, but I was a dancer for over 20 years, and I still have a lot of muscle to my thighs and I've got some muscled &#34;junk in my trunk.&#34; These pants fit my waist perfectly and the long size was even long enough for my long legs.  They barely fit over my thighs and butt, though, and I would not have actually worn them as I'm sure it would have ripped a seam.  If you're a woman with a small rear and very little muscle to you, these would be a great fit.  If you're larger or have a larger rear do not waste your time!
B00K7WZJE8|3|It was WAY too big.  I am 5'9&#34; and about 130 pounds.  I usually wear a medium shirt and a size 4-6 dress.  The reviews all said it runs small, so I thought a medium would be fine, if not a little on the small size.  It was easily two sizes too large.
B00LISQ8FE|5|Well made. Perfect fit. Love it !
B00ODNRK4O|5|Great by but found it on the company's site cheaper
B00AFHP5S0|5|The seller came through on this item!  Had never seen this &#34;Pony&#34; shirt before, and LOVED that the person we gave it to as a gift LOVED it.  It was a unique design that I still haven't seen anywhere else.  I would buy from this seller again!
B009GE3ZAS|4|I can wear a medium to a large in tops so I ordered a large after reading some of the reviews and had to send it back because they run extremely small. I did order another one in an XL because I have a photo shoot I want to use this for and the material felt very comfortable and it will give me the figure I'm looking for in my shoot. If you order one be sure to go up at least 2 sizes! I love it!
B003BVZ4R4|5|Great sweatpants.  Order one size smaller than you normally wear.
B009TB9TB2|5|So cute and comfortable but still sexy. It fit great and felt great.  It washed really well.  I love it!!!  I would highly recommend it.
B00P80BVGE|4|This jacket is not as heavy, thick or as warm as my other Walls Fleece Quilted Jacket, even though the UPC code is the same, the models numbers are different, I use it as a jacket liner for my work jacket as I spend quite bit of time outdoors in all kinds of weather. Even though this jacket is not as warm, it will do as jacket liner for my personal jacket, as it was originally intended..
B00L71IR6A|5|very nice fit
B007EKQ7QU|5|Love these! Worth the price
B00CEML8G2|5|Perfect in every way I need to be. Time to go to the beach. This product is a must have
B000FBUZ54|5|The shirt has a generous fit, good workmanship, and quality materials.  I will buy a few more.  I still looks new after many washings as well.
B003IBNSH0|2|Like other reviews say, this costume runs very small. The material is very cheap and scratchy. I ended up getting my daughter another Halloween costume and using this in the dress-up bin.
B00BUYY9T8|4|Love this shirt, just wish it was longer.  Perfect for the heat and humidity of the south.  Comes through the wash beautifully.
B001QT8KV0|3|too small , they credited my account quick , would buy agian. just in a bigger size.not all one size fits all.
B001B2JIMC|4|True to size, XL fits me well in chest and shoulders, (I have a 45 inch chest and 55 inch overarm) and the material seems durable enough for a shirt in this price range. I was looking for a basic long sleeve tee to run in and to wear around the house, so this kind of fits the bill. The only thing that's really preventing me from buying another half dozen or so of these shirts is that it seems to run really long. I'm 5'10, and this shirt comes almost halfway down my thigh. The sleeves are a good length for me, so I'm guessing that the 6'4\\" guy that the length fits would have a problem with the arms. I tuck it in when I wear it running, so it ends up not being a problem, but most \\"athletic fit\\" shirts that I've purchased are usually shorter than this one.
B00N038N1W|4|I like this miraclesuit swimdress,  it is flattering,  but still wish for bigger<br />cup size and also for more support.  But,  by far, it was the best of several<br />that I have tried...  It is a keeper.
B00626P9G6|5|Bought this for my wife. She loves large t-shirts and she loves this on.
B005QPVQJI|4|Love this shirt!  Deeper &#34;V&#34; than I expected, but I really love it!  Soft and comfortable.  Great for every Star wars fan!
B009JEZGHK|5|I've had one pair of these for about a year now.  I have worn them every day since I got them.  At that time I could only get one pair from the manufacturer. Never had a clasp come off or open.  I have also worn them through US and international airport security with no issues.  No metal, so no issues.  The clasps are strong.  I bought them for the airport and also for my vehicles.  Using metal clasps had damaged the seats on a couple of my vehicles.  These clasps slide smooth across the leather or fabric vehicle seats, no scratches or tears.  The clasps don't catch on anything so they don't pop off like the metal clasps do.
B0058GMDBU|5|I am reviewing Jacques Moret Juniors Solid Fuzzy Babba Slipper Socks, Black, Medium/Large.  These slipper socks are extremely soft on the inside! They have little grips on the bottom. The size medium/large is a little big for my size 8.5 feet but the small/medium are too small.
B00CDRYKP4|5|Absolutely love this, it fits great, quality material and very flattering.
B0096NIJIM|4|I guess you get what you pay for.  The dress itself has so much potential, if only the material was different.  The top is a little see through but nothing a slip can't fix. I like the dress overall.
B0007NIC8M|5|Fit my daughter perfectly, however, too expensive. Returned them because I found a better price at a local store which is nationwide..
B00DPEO9VO|2|I bought the 12 month size for my 6 month old because there were no other options at that time. I am glad I chose the bigger because it fits my now 7 month old 18 pounds baby just fine. Based on this I think the smaller size would have been way too small for him. I did not have too high expectation based on the price but it should not look like a heavily worn piece after just two wash. Overall it is wearable but cheep material and very inaccurate sizing.
B00KICD8ZE|5|The trim isn't cut precisely but I can't complain for the price.
B0013F51JQ|4|I like my bra...it holds me up nicely
B000VS0WZO|5|I did not use this costume for an infant,  instead I use it to turn into an Easter bonnet for a costume party it was perfect
B00FXT8EN8|5|Awesome bra, would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes more covering designs.<br />Size-wise it fits as expected.
B00FBD2G2Q|5|These socks are a great bargain you get ten pairs and they are of high quaility compared to the other brands
B00NLMOF6O|4|Really nice buckle and great material
B008I583Z8|5|I've never worn plaid shorts before this pair and I wasn't sure I'd keep them, but I absolutely love them. The style is just right. The pockets are great. The belt, well it's so-so, but I can live with that since I can change to another belt. But the shorts are super cute. So I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00I9FAXUU|4|Nice printing. Very comfortable a little short though.
B00MCVPDWU|5|good good good.
B00OJ3DK1U|5|Amazing just what I asked for
B0017WO754|3|The material of these yoga pants is very smooth and comfortable, but the medium I purchased is a bit smaller than I was expecting.  I wear a size 8 and thought a medium would be about perfect~not so.
B00H0AGMBE|5|I don't usually write reviews but this one I should. For the price, I am amazed at what I've got. Exactly what I wanted and it fits well. I kinda wish it doesn't have heels... Today is the first day I wear it, so I am not sure with the amount I walk, if this will hurt. but it feels great when I put it on. Love the material and how neat it wrap around my legs. Also it is below freezing today, and it definitely helped me to feel warmer. My knees get cold all the time... Anyways. It really worth the price. I feel little unstable about the heels. But hopefully it will be fine.
B00HN27EUW|5|My wife and I were given this bow as a gift and LOVE it. We have taken pictures of her for the last eight months. Here are a couple of examples.
B00GWOVPOI|5|I like this suit because it fits well and met my needs for a quick buy. Although I weigh more now than ever; it does help hide some of my imperfections.
B007VTJZAO|1|I bought the coat about 3 months ago and was very happy with the purchase :natural leather, natural fur, good looks.Then 85 days after the purchase I discovered that the coat got ripped along the right pocket seam and up. I did not anything out of the ordinary that day- drove in the car to the dentist , drove to the store. There was nothing in the pocket. I did not notice any sound of ripped leather, I did not see how it got ripped, but that day I discovered a hole in the coat. The leather appeared very thin, maybe about 1 mm thin.I did not know how to interpret this disaster: is it poor quality of the leather, is it leather at all? I wanted a refund for the purchase because there was something defective in the leather coat if it rips like that in less than three months..<br />THE United Face customer service responded that the item only could be returned in 30 days in unworn new condition. Obviously, we did not understand each other: I was reporting that the coat unexpectedly ripped in less than three months of gentle wear. There is something defective about it. We are talking different languages. They did not offer any help in resolving the issue with defective coat.<br />photo (3).JPG<br />photo (2).JPG<br />photo (1).JPG
B00PSWSIZO|5|Love it so comfy it gives a nice shape to the body I would order more
B002UKPU9E|5|This jacket is perfect for spring and can be worn over a dress or with jeans.  I was looking for a red jacket but didn't want one that was over orangey or bright.  It is very cute on and I love the red bow in back that gives it a feminine touch without being too girlish.  Can't wait to wear it.
B00GABJUD6|5|This is definitely an &#34;ooo la la&#34; skirt on my lovely wife! We had a laugh when she first put it on as I had just left it on the bed for her to discover when she got home. I heard an &#34;what the heck is this?&#34; followed by her coming out of the bedroom with it pulled on like a tube top! LOL! And while I guess it could be worn that way too, as a skirt (of which she was highly skeptical) it fit her figure to a tee. She is normally a dress size 8.
B004QPXT8A|5|3 days before we left for our Disney trip I decided to order 30 pins (for only $30) for my girls to trade. What a deal! They were delivered less than 48 hours later and actually had some great pins in the mix that my girls kept instead of trading! It was such a savings and my girls were thrilled!
B00G652OBG|1|This shirt is not worth the money - shrank down to child size when laundered.  Very disappointing waste of money
B00GMEXLPE|5|comfortable great fitting pants that look awesome at the office or for a casual night out
B00LV09VWQ|5|Beautiful
B00C1SHSG8|4|It fits well
B004K40LL0|5|The measurements online were very helpful. Fits like a glove and I can't wait to wear it on Halloween!
B001UG9DQK|5|This was a pretty good purchase. I ordered them the 15th, and they arrived on the 19th, not a moment too soon. I ordered them from TotallyCostumes, and the packaging was nice and organized. I order them for my friend's Hercules outfit, and they worked very nicely. He wears a size 10 in street shoes and they fit him almost perfectly. The straps stayed up fairly well for most of the night (we went to a Halloween party). The sole of the shoe is just fabric so it won't withstand a lot of wear and tear. The back of the shoes are Velcro so they are adjustable for most sizes. My friend has rather small calves so they were almost too large for him, but thankfully the Velcro stuck to the brown material. Overall, these served their purpose and looked very nice with the Forum Roman Gladiator Adult costume. They completed the costume and added a nice polished look. :)  [[ASIN:B000UXDGDA Adult Greek or Roman Gladiator Sandals - Adult Std.]]
B003BWGR7E|5|For the price, a very nice wig! I was surprised because most costume wigs are very cheaply made. This was very nice and spot on for Dorothy
B008YNWHUQ|2|Even though the description doesn't mention the type of fit, this is a slim fit style hoodie. Not fat guy friendly. Would have been nice to know this prior to buying a hoodie that doesn't fit me.<br /><br />Furthermore, the quality isn;t there either.  This thing is paper thin and the logo work on the back seems cheap.  I'll definitely be returning this one.
B00DQVBTQ4|5|Great quality and VERY VERY cute for the holidays!  Super soft and adorable on my little one. I love that it's unisex too!
B00DNIC694|5|T-shirts is very soft. Be aware, it does run on the small side.
B00NHI41JI|5|The red and black Ax Paris dress fits and looks great.
B009311JG6|3|It's a really nice color, but when I put it on the sequins rubbed at my skin and made it difficult to move in.
B00IVENA3Q|5|Beautiful!
B00GS97U6E|5|Soft, comfortable, hasn't shrunk or twisted out of shape.  Love it!
B006AAHODK|5|My dress is lovely and flows very well.  I really like the beading.  The only drawback is what is supposed to be a built in bra is actually just some padding.  Al in all, a very good buy.
B00SUV6FNW|4|Worth what I paid. Would fit a 4-8 easily, possibly size 10. Does bleed extra ink, will dye your bra, so may want to wash before wearing.
B006KU1VQG|1|It is a little wide, or loose, but not a deal breaker. The length is just to below the belly button. It did say in the add, it ran shorter...Cute shirt over all.Except It Developed HOLES All over it!!! I went to scratch an itch and MY FINGER WENT THROUGH THE SHIRT LIKE CHEAP PANTYHOSE, and I don't have long nails...bottom line, fool me once hot mama ink...I'll never order ANYTHING from your company again ...WHERE IS YOUR QUALITY CONTROL!!!!!! Of course that is rhetorical question....because there is OBVIOUSLY no one minding your store...inspected by fell asleep on the JOB!!!! I just CANNOT BELIEVE HOW POORLY THE SHIRT WAS MADE!!!!! tsk tsk
B00DVHUD2E|4|Shirt fit kind of big for a small but quality is nice. A bit thin but it's nice! Arrived quickly!
B00DD7ZHOG|3|too simple and the kind of dress u put to stay at home.... I am not impressed, I thought I would like it more than that
B00FD79T70|5|The perfect normcore hat. Nice construction and fit. Yardwork tested.
B008A5ONU0|2|ok arms are long like others mentioned...and i will add that it is a little toward the slim fit especially if you wear something underneath.... and it just looks feels like anything you would pick at walmart...the material is not that special
B00BK0EOHO|5|This chemise is lovely- it fit well around the bust and skims your body in a very flattering way. It's extremely soft and hopefully it holds up well in the wash. Kind of sexy for comfy sleepwear!
B00ETPDEXM|3|Verry snall.
B00Q10K0IU|5|loved these gloves they are super comfortable and work as great as they say they do! the gloves really do keep your hands warm while allowing you to use your touchscreen device! i definitely recommend you to buy these gloves.
B00MVSK7FM|1|Ordered a large. Looks like an extra small
B009UQ2F94|5|I bought this for my daughter-in-law.  The ordering sizing-chart is very confusing, she's a XS and it came in as a L...a little weird but it fit nicely on her.  She loves it.  Very nice looking jacket.
B00E0FFCRW|5|this is so worth the money, fit to my granddaughter size. She really likes this and keeps her looking comfortable in school
B00I3WD3NI|3|I asked for large arrived medium
B0035RNN0Y|5|My veterinarian recommend we started giving our dogs probiotics. We were in search of a chewable treat with a probiotic that suited the needs of our elderly dogs. A friend recommended this product after it helped her dog with some skin issues. My dogs have not been taking them for long but they have tried them and love them. We have picky animals and they would spit them out if they didn't taste good to them. I look forward to seeing what long term effects these great treats have on our fur babies :)
B00RR07BEO|5|adorable shirt--nice design--good quality--nice fabric
B00DNG30GE|4|When I ordered the costume I was afraid it was going to be a little loose but it was a perfect fit ! It hugs your body tightly and it's true to size. Only thing I didn't like is that the tail didn't come attached to the costume. I had to get my friend to sew it on the costume. I wore the costume three times and by the third time the costumes material was coming off. I mean it wasn't an issue for me since it was only going to be worn for Halloween. But still I can't really wear it again if I wanted to. Overall it's a good costume but for temporary uses only.
B00ID1Q9VM|4|The shirt itself is nice - I take a large - ordered and XL and still too small.
B00J6SJXO6|5|I love, love, love the dress!!!!  I cut off the straps and made it into a tube halter dress.  Lots of compliments for such a great bargain!  Ordering more!!!!!
B00D4KDGHW|5|Daughter is tall for her age and wears size 2. Outfit for great. Shirt is a little short but most are for her.  I dry the sweater on a rack and it has lasted several washes and still looks cute and vibrant.
B008F5HPCI|5|This suit is easy to get into and very easy to breathe in. It runs true to size. It was a bit difficult the first time to figure out how to zipper it shut, but now it's easy. The ideas are endless with this item!
B00V5547XU|5|good
B00JOWABNG|5|This has quickly become one of my favorite shirts both for lounging around the house or running errands. I am petite (5'2&#34;) and usually wear small to medium on clothes. I purchased a medium of this shirt and it fits exactly as pictured. It appears to be of good quality and I've already washed it several times. It has held up well. I also did not find the hood too small like some other reviewersa, it works as a hood for me just fine.
B004UTVPQU|5|This item is of good quality and sturdy. Be wary that you may need to order a size up from what you normally wear and it does have  a slender build to it but for skinny guys like me it looks great. I order nearly all of my clothes from here now and love them all.<br /><br />The inking on this is quite nice and doesn't seem to fade after a few washes and the design looks true to the image although do realize that this doesn't have long sleeves but are rather short so you can layer it with something else.
B00H8KIN2M|5|Great, well-made shirt!  I'm 5'9&#34; tall and weigh 165 pounds with an athletic build. The medium fits me fine -- just right! The Burnt Olive goes well with jeans, and the Puma logo is a nice touch, without being overdone (i.e., too large). I agree with a previous reviewer who thought the &#34;V&#34; could be deeper, but I still plan to purchase another in a different color.
B004Z99OU4|5|Love it!
B00YTA4DNW|5|Nice quality tee fits well and is light gotten
B004YDS5SI|5|Love, love, love this ... i ordered 2 more.I would live in this if i could. Its made very well,and washes good.
B00ORKMWN2|5|It was a bit large but got it fix and it was so beautiful on me.
B00M51P2PA|1|ONE STAR!!! Too small ordered for a 5yr old recieved a 1yr old fitting.smfh!!!!
B00V2GVXQG|5|Very nice quality sweatshirt with beautiful lettering. The fit was just right with it being a little slouchy. The only thing I would have liked is the neck to be cut like the description: off the shoulder. It was cut to be just a larger neck and didn't fall off the shoulder like the picture. Overall though it was great.
B004Q6GXHI|5|this was above quality to what we were expecting and the price was better than what I thought for the product.
B00NH0EPK6|5|Cute and comfortable for everyday wear, non-slip but not too tight.
B00CESG988|5|very cute dress, looked good on, light fabric.,. ,
B002902QYW|1|Hubby was looking for a replacement for his 20 year old wallet like this and was very disappointed that only a few cards would fit.  He found it totally useless.
B00AX7K6ZE|2|I bought this to use for my 3 month old, but it was too big for her head. Clearly is not for 0-12 months.
B00Q435G8S|5|Fits perfect but I can wear it as a dress its long on me in 5'6. In I ordered a large.
B00CX547FE|4|not bad, but prefer disposable ones!
B00D402J7A|5|It fits big, but not too big where it is unwearable. I would say it is about a size up. That was good though, by the end of summer, it fit him perfect!  It did the job, no sunburn for my baby boy. It is also adorable,  the blue is so cute!
B00OHRTNQE|3|The large size ran smaller than expected- I would have purchased a XL if I had known
B005YV0PSM|5|Love the price and the warmth
B008BJPYDU|4|A nice good looking hoodie that fit but your basically paying for the brand name, luckily I love me some under armour.
B005CWTTY4|5|These socks are great!  They were well made and fit perfectly.  These &#34;shoes&#34; can be used for everyday outfits or for a more formal occasion like a baptism.
B003K1721Q|5|Very good quality belt for the price.....I have now worn it many times, and it looks like it will last and stay looking good. Very happy with purchase.
B00AFRW5FQ|4|I really like this shirt. It is as it looks on the screen. Fits kind of loose and looks great worn over a long tank top.
B00ADPXAFO|5|One of my favorite T-Shirts
B00HG9T3EC|3|So these harem pants weren't really what I had expected, they do fit nicely and they are quite comfy however the material feels like kind used for many if not most Halloween costumes. But they're totally perfect for lounging around, hopefully I can figure out how to style these so they don't look like the bottom half of a ninja costume.
B001BF1BQK|5|perfect fit. Strap easy to adjust and I can leave them in position if needed. Pretty in a plain classic way. Slight padding.<br />Very happy with purchase
B00PSKTNU0|1|The &#34;Small&#34; belt is not 34&#34; long as advertised.  It's 40&#34; long.
B00DN55OUK|5|This brand is new to me. I found them at a retailer a week before I ordered these. They fit so well and were comfortable to wear. But color's were limited so, I looked online for additional colors................ and you find everything online. I got black and gray and love them.
B001BKB8U4|4|An armpit zipper on only one-side??
B0077QGOTG|5|Great quality t-shirt, fits like a glove!
B00Q9CEO32|3|This sweater was bulkier than I prefer. I found it to be a bit stiff.<br />I opted to return it; no problems with Amazon Prime.
B00862DD6C|5|Very nice.  They do run a bit small.
B001LJCHZA|5|Love this bra, wear it for nursing and the rest of the time as well. Its comfortable and durable for the price. Very inexpensive and flattering.
B00MWAC39M|4|Like a lot
B00JJ8ML5G|5|This jacket is light weight but water resistant. It is perfect for early autumn evenings and late fall days. The color is beautiful and the buttoned pockets are a nice detail. I also love the length. It doesn't ride up when I bend to help a kid or pick something up but it doesn't restrict my stride when it's zipped and I'm walking.
B00E4P7N02|4|Received several compliments (3) when I wore this shirt the first time.  It is very comfortable, relaxed fit.  However, it is a much heavier material than normal for Lucky shirts.  I was surprised.  Will be warm to wear this summer.  Good for rainy days though.
B008RKPSBG|5|Great Belt that goes well with both Black and Brown slacks.  Easy release. It is by far the best belt for the price that I have pruchased.
B00EALYLAK|5|thank you
B0000AOEA4|5|The product is hilarious. However, the zipper broke on the second time used. My wife had to go buy a zipper and sew it in.  That was disappointing since it was a splurge for us and it wasn't cheap.
B00P3AQEFW|5|Really impressed by the item. Fits nice that it even has adjustable strings so a better fit. It definitely is long that if you gold the ends on each side and pull around you, it makes a full circle. So it's definitely good !
B00J2RQ7C2|5|Arrived super early! Really cute,the bottoms fit a bit snug but I'm tiny ( 5&#34;1 1/2 and 100 lbs) but really happy with this order
B00A0K8H8C|5|I hate the big, bulky winter coats and am glad I decided to give this a try.  It is very stylish and warm, yet very light.  The fit is perfect as well - true to size!
B00KOA3K5I|5|I love these jeans !!! Are so comfortable and very soft.
B00OTZDMC0|3|It is cute but even empty it is bulky
B00EVARUWQ|5|This is a very nice hat for the price. I got it for my Willy Wonka costume and it is perfect. Now I just need the vest and bowtie.
B007VDON66|5|I am happy with the way these fit and the way the fabric feels of these boxer briefs as well as the price.
B007XB1FNA|5|I own so many Patty Women's clothing but they all run too big. I love them so much I don't want to return them. So I usually wash them in hot water and dry them on hot. At first the size chart said I was a Large, then I went with a medium. Now with a small It is just perfect for me and no hot washing!!! I'm 5'6, 145-150lbs, 36-38 C/D.
B003BHLN2S|5|Took me a couple of tries to get the hang of it it after first but it really works amazing.  I have heavy periods and i only have to use a pantyliner for a just in case leakage great item really \\"frees\\" you up as a woman
B0050SCV7M|5|These pants fit perfectly my changing body shape.  As a woman approaching 50, my body shape is shifting.  Fat is accumulating in my thighs and hips.  These pants address those areas without pinching.  I especially like the length which has been difficult to find most of my adult life.  I would purchase another pair if given the opportunity.
B004V2344C|5|This a beautiful hat and when ordering make sure you get the correct measurement of your head to enjoy the styling. To the regular Hat wearer you will find yourself in the mirrors a lot of times just because of the looks and style of this hat. Thumbs up on this one.
B00IYSWW7E|4|Very nice.
B0076E7CJ0|4|Good fit.  Cute look for a masquerade party.
B002SDE3X2|5|I purchased this for my son.  He was 1 year old two weeks before Halloween.  He's a rather large child (always &#62;95% for both height and weight), so I purchased the 18-24 months.  It fit like a glove.  He wasn't too excited for the puppy head, but it was precious while he wore it.  I'll be buying from this company again.
B00MC9SD1A|5|Amazing, and I love it! Ty!
B002UNB13A|5|Everything about this dress is above my expectations.  The photos do not do it justice.  I bought it originally to wear as a bridesmaid dress...and I have used it repeatedly since, how many bridesmaid dresses can you say THAT about?  LOL
B001N0ZRKO|5|I'm glad I bought this.  I am very pleased with it.  It created a little static in my hair when I took it off so I just rinsed it in fabric softener and that cured it :)  .
B00LJOLKJ6|5|It fits perfect && it didn't take long to get here I love it 😍
B00E815S6I|2|CHEAP MAKE
B00L9IU0GQ|5|Lovely outfit. Used it as a cover-up for being poolside while on vacation.  It fit very well and was precisely the right length. Stops mid-thigh so that's not too long and not too short. Can also be worn like a regular dress. Only thing is that it's a bit transparent so wear dark underwear!
B00J8CM5QI|5|Her awesome uncle loves his shirt! Great, bold graphics.
B00LNDF9QI|5|Lots of complement, super soft, feels like a sweat pants!
B007NXCQCC|3|Must start off by saying this is a really well made costume.  All quality material, pretty, and cute. I ordered a size 40, and I normally wear a size 8-10 or a Large dress.<br />The blouse is high quality, but was uncomfortably tight on my arms.  My arms measure 12 1/2&#34; around.<br />The top was very, very tight.  I wear a size 38D.  I was able to zip it, barely.  My boobs were coming out of the top, and I was okay with that, they looked great.<br />I would have kept the dress, but I am returning it because the bottom, from the waist down was HUGE.  Waaay too much material for the skirt.  I even bought a petticoat to poof it out thinking that would help, but it just made it look worse.  Very frumpy, you could fit a person under there!<br />Anyway, sad I had to return it, because it really was the nicest made costume I have ever bought, but the bottom was too big, and looked silly.
B00528DJIU|5|What can I say, Bushwood from one of the best movies ever.
B00B2PMF50|4|I was afraid to get this scarf based on the reviews, it not the best scarf I've had but it worth how much I paid for it. I actually wore it as a hijab ( head covering) it works great it nice and stretchy and stayed in place with out pins, Kinda like a snood, I really like it and I will be getting more soon to match my other outfits
B007C4GJJ8|5|Good thick socks.
B00A7TKVOO|5|I work outside in ga. The heat makes regulate cargo pants uncomfortable. These match my uniform are light and very durable. They are also very affordable and they were mailed out quick. I'm a size 12 and I'm 5'7&#34; I wish I would of gotten a med tall, but they did shrink a little. I will be ordering several others
B00EWA5BAI|1|the hat is low quality material and does not show the underside of the bill where it says 'girl', loudly announcing it's knock off status.
B008J4PEFU|5|All around I am happy with the purchase. I was kept comfortably warm and the order met all expectations. Size is true to size at least in my case and have had no issues throwing it in the wash with like colors.
B00478QQFE|1|YOU COULD NOT TELL IT WAS A PARTRIDGE IN A PEAR TREE.  I HAD BOUGHT IT AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT, BECAUSE IT WAS NOT VERY NICE, I DID NOT GIVE IT TO ANYONE.  IT WAS A BAD BUY!!!
B0074157VK|5|Having a hard time finding clothes that fit my son and he will wear.  He liked these and wears them.
B00K315N94|5|Great pouch. Works like a charm
B00AY0SF8A|5|Show your support for the best thrash/speed metal band ever.
B009HKNKXI|5|First and foremost! This jacket looks good in the pic. I did not expect it to look near as good in reality, but it looks great just like the pics.<br /><br />The quality? is better than I expected! It's thick and feels like real good material, I inspected the stitching and it is very tight and nice.<br />Okay now moving on to sizing: I am (5'7&#34; tall), (168lbs), and (31&#34; waist) and my chest is 34-36&#34;  I ordered the asian LARGE which is US MEDIUM and it fits great with some room to spare. Just to help you guys out with your future orders.
B00KIVJ7HS|5|Adorable! Fit true to size, comfortable and adorable! Can't wait to wear it to all our Christmas parties!
B000LUXZPG|5|Excellent fit - just as described
B00LE4UMGI|4|I really loved this dress. I did looking around on othersites too. This runs small because its in Asian sizes. I went with a size bigger then I normally would wear and it was great.  My husband loves it on me too.
B003AIKWHK|5|Softest jammies ever!
B0043WJAMA|5|Comfortable, fit as expected. Keep me toasty warm, especially under jeans.  Well worth to have in the Northeast of USA.
B0042Z0TXC|3|Its extremely squished and deformed. Here's a tip though that worked for me - get foamcore aka poster board - put it and glue it inside of the antlers.
B0018OQQFU|5|Of course fit depends on your body type. For me these fit great. The length and the waist were perfect and jeans look good.
B003WOL13G|5|Very stylish and formal looking vest. Great buy!
B007JX6NQG|3|Have these same pants in another color, but these fit a little larger even though they are the same size. Otherwise, they are great quality and very comfortable.
B008GJUMWI|5|Unique styling and perfect fit PLUS a really quality product...she loves it!!  Quality and edgy style make this a cut above the ordinary hoodie!
B00KIL38WS|1|Not true to size
B005VVSPR8|5|This item is as described and fits true to size.  I haven't had a chance to wear it with the outfit I bought it for yet.
B0057X9Q3C|5|The shirt is great in every way, I wanted it to be a loose fit and it is. A little too loose but it will do, I should have purchased a 3x or 2x. Color is correct, length right and overall very good...
B00LMZA156|5|shirt fit as expected was the samething you see on here ..no tea
B0081K9EXU|3|I was kind of disappointed in this item. It was made in China (what's new) but that is not the problem.It does not work like it is supposed to. The original military ones would allow the cup to set partially inside the smaller opening while heating. This version only lets it set atop and unsecured so it could fall off. either a design flaw, or trying to save material $$$.
B0012HAVHM|5|Great price, this is my favorite bra!
B005W2N184|5|This is one of our favorite outfits for our granddaughter.  She seems very comfortable in it and we don't have to search for matching tops and bottoms! Fabric holds up well to repeated washing. The straps don't droop like other rompers we've bought, a MUST. And it's just so cute on her... Season for this is almost over in much of the country but I would highly recommend this item.
B00LQ1M5GY|4|Nice,thick material great for fall
B00IE8W5I0|5|Quality shorts. Looks like its made from good, quality material. Shorts fit perfect for me, and I even ordered a small. They weren't way too small like a lot of reviewers posted. Maybe its just me, I dunno. I'm a skinny guy, but not super skinny. My waist is about a 31 and the small fit perfectly. They look awesome!!!
B0085EIREY|3|Looks great,  but the picture isn't even remotely close to the appearance of the design on the shirt.  Also lost the little ties almost immediately.  It was still wearable but obviously there were quality issues.  Overall I love the shirt but I doubt it would have held up to really frequent wear.
B00MRGSP8O|2|The whole thing fit nicely, save for the sleeves, which were tight, especially around the biceps. It made bending my arms painful as the tightness pinched at my skin. However the torso was alright. I definitely need a larger size, and would like to return the blazer I received.
B00PZ6MUTI|5|Great deal and fast shipping.
B004KAAD58|4|I got these for my son. He thought they were funny looking and didn;t look real enough as jeans.  But the comfort level is what got him to say it was a good gift after all.
B007MY656A|3|I thought it was a sportbra that slipped over your ead.  have a broken wrist. The picture on line did not display them so disappointed but hookedthem and I am using it by slipping it on. Gives ok support to 40 b-c
B00EETDFCI|5|This dress is so cute.  I purchased a size 6 and it fits perfectly (I wear a size 6 or 8 depending on the label).  The red is a bit darker so not too much.  The buttons and zipper front are nice additions (although silver color rather than gold would have been my preference).  For the price, I would recommend this dress to others.
B00HQZ1EMK|5|Love the style of the coat
B0049J9ZLS|3|The item was a bit too big, so I had to trim it.  It's a bit cartoony, but I guess that's the idea.
B005SKD72K|5|the color was more vibrant which was awesome. I bought this for my 5 year old she's tall so i bought it a little bigger and it fits her great, comes down to a little above the knees. She loves her new jacket keeps her warm and looking so cute. very well put together very soft inside and out!!
B00BGBUQ1K|4|The foot part was a little large so I sewed it and made it smaller.  The sleeves are a little long but I can fold the cuff up and it's fine.  I wish you had them in a cooler fabric, we're in South Florida and the fleece is a little hot but it'll be perfect for the cooler nights in the winter.
B00L49CRFW|5|Very unusual and great gift for wine lovers.
B00CMHB8NC|4|I love the set But the prints are totally different
B00IP57ZZ0|4|Have to get the band adjusted to fit my arm otherwise it slides up and down my arm.
B0045V98LC|5|User found this item very satisfactory.  The product adapted itself to the body shape and user  found the band not so tight as with cotton bras.  She also liked that it was stretchable.
B00M1YOAG8|5|This is the go to outfit lately, great quality, perfect combination of softness and durability.
B0012QUSHG|5|Only problem: insufficient packing. The shipping box had become torn and mangled, leaving the box around the sunglasses exposed. Luckily, they were not damaged.
B000KN4JXQ|5|I have been wearing Jockey brand briefs since I was a teenager.  I'm now 68.  I have tried other brands a few times-the fruity guys, Munsingwear, Hanes & others, but the elastic waistbands on the other brands lose their &#34;spring&#34; after several washings, but these last a lot longer.
B00LP5VCNI|5|Love these shirts.  Great for work. I have several.
B000CH3MPQ|5|Required to buy this brand and shade for my daughters dance recital. Love them! They are very durable, good quality tights!
B003Y003NW|5|Fits well
B003LPUP88|4|I've used these socks on my baby since he was one month old. He's almost 3 months now and I don't think he'll be able to use them past six months old. He is a large baby (10 pounds at birth), but I don't think an average size baby could wear this 6 to 18 months. Other than sizing, I like the socks. They are perfect for warm weather and have held up well through washings.
B003JM5FFQ|1|So Jos A Bank decides to clear out presumably old inventory of dress/sport shirts and phones Amazon for help.  The shirts are listed for sale on this site AND on Jos A Bank's site contemporaneously.  All or most of the orders that were sold on Amazon are canceled by JAB 6 days later, yet the ones placed on their site are fulfilled.    What a fiasco.  I'll never deal with JAB again.  Phew!
B000IBH9RS|4|warm but bulky. Is to be expected for insulated bibs. no surprises.
B00809XQL8|5|beautiful shirt fantastic detail ......dig those 4 pockets
B00GMJ7DAS|4|These fit well and feel comfortable.  Quality is not as good as some of the sport company brands but will have to wait and see how they hold up after multiple washings.  Price was good for a two pack
B00DFQMPVI|5|This is a crazy great deal. The binding stitching could be better, but for the price? I'm certainly not complaining. I bought three and am now ready for family birthdays. Buy it!
B002JTXB06|5|This costume does run big. I am 5'6&#34; and 125lbs and I got an XS after reading the reviews about the sizing. It fits very well and is only a bit loose in the lower arm and waist areas. I am very happy with this costume considering its intended use and low price. This is the same costume Spirit sells for over $50. This is not a costume for authentic cosplay; you should put the time in and make your own costume for that. It is however, perfect for Halloween.
B00631VM0W|5|I really like the way this gown feels and I LOVE the length.  Sleeves are great, and fold back as I need them to for face-washing.
B0063D3Q2M|5|Fits as expected<br />Daughter loves it<br />Color is as pictured<br />Recommend highly<br />She has worn it both to the beach and to the pool. Stays snug
B008TTL9O0|5|These Pants fit true to size. There is a very comfortable elastic waist band. The material is somewhat thicker;I think these will run a little hot in the summertime, but they seem to have a nice surface which will resist dirt and they have some sheen to them.<br /><br />The cargo pockets on the side are good for storage, but there are just too many pockets overlapping, making the sides a little too thick for me. There is a regular pocket, then a zippered pocket and then more pouches for small things, all on top of each other on the cargo.<br /><br />The lower-leg-pockets are smaller and have a velcro strip inside to keep them closed.<br /><br />The rear butt pockets have tabs with buttons to close, so it's nice to keep a wallet without fear of it falling out.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with the pants and especially the price, and I will be keeping them.
B00KJB9YG6|4|This is adorable.
B00CRBN7N2|5|Super cute and great quality
B00LI9W2FS|3|Pant is extremely long<br />Poor quality material
B00HR0R5SG|4|Nice jacket.
B000V9JQRI|4|I bought a 2XL for me and an L for my wife.<br /><br />The 2XL is nice and roomy and reasonably well insulated.  It's a decent replacement for the XL USAF N-3B I had to turn in when I PCSed from the Northern Tier.<br /><br />Side-by-side comparison with my wife's genuine issue USAF N-3B (size S) revealed the following differences.<br /><br />1. Hood on the Rothco is detachable, which is not a bad thing IMO.<br />2. Rothco outer shell 100% cotton and NOT water repellent; the USGI is nylon-cotton blend like field jacket material and doesn't soak up water as fast as the Rothco.  The Rothco is still excellent for cold-dry climate<br />3. Elbows not reinforced.<br />4. Metal buttons - no big deal, but not sewn on securely.<br />5. Made in China.<br />6. Not as well insulated as USGI (but again, still not bad).<br />7. Rothco slash pockets not as deep as USGI, also not insulated on the outside.<br /><br />Above are the major differences.  Also half-a-dozen minor detail differences not listed here, but are no biggie IMO.<br /><br />You're almost never going to find a new, genuine USGI N-3B parka -  and you'll probably never ever find anything bigger than a LARGE.  At the price, the Rothco parka is a good, close substitute - especially for the larger sizes.
B00KT8WFU6|4|Nice jacket
B00NQ8X2LW|2|There's a huge logo printed on the back of the sweater. Material felt cheap and thin.
B00OH2B6IC|1|The fit was fine...but...the sweater fell apart in my hands and the bow is pinned on the sweater with a Very Inappropriate pin! Definitely NOT for a 2 year old.
B00ISRC8W0|5|I am a fit cyclist and have very low body fat.  I love the fit but I think some people will think they are too snug. You should go one size up if this is you.  I ride 5 day a week and am used to the snug cycle clothes.  These seem to be high quality and are my top choice now.
B003768FMO|5|My girlfriend told me she always wanted a flip top lighter with a daisy on it (pretty specific, right?). Well, after searching high and low, carsons collectibles delivered! Great quality work, cool design. I support this purchase 100%. Go on. Do it.
B0029O01EA|3|I ordered these in a size four, the size I normally wear for pants.  Not only were they too large, they were too long!  The thickness and scratchiness of the fabric wouldn't have bothered me so much if they had just fit.  I'll be returning these.  You might want to consider sizing down.
B00GT3AMSW|4|I was worried that stretching it out would keep it that way. But you actually stretch it relatively and it will return to its original state. I really like the dark purple colour. Warm if you're wearing it for the winter, and can be stylish for other months depending on your outfit.
B00M59EGMM|4|Bought it small and once I tried it on I noticed it was little baggy (somewhat large)
B000NZW3IY|5|I am suffering from the dreaded old guy disorder of \\"erectile dysfunction.\\" When my blood-shot eyes saw this shirt, I knew my sexual problem would be solved if the shirt was purchased by me. The wolf on the left really turns me on. I know that I won't have any more problems with my drooping, lifeless little buddy once I get hold of the sexy wolf shirt.    Thank you,    The born again cannine lover.
B00LMI9A6Y|5|Wow!  I just received these leggings in the mail and tried them on.  I don't want to take them off!  They feel so good on, and fit like a glove. They are not binding at all.  I hope they launder well!
B00D45UIQ4|1|This is nearly see through material, not as expected by the picture. Size runs small in adult sizes, length was good though.
B005NOS57S|5|Comfortable well made product, works as advertised looks nice.
B00IZTVISQ|5|They fit perfect.
B00B5BRVE6|3|I really love LRG and I am glad to have these in my closet and wardrobe building up my street wear
B007TCNHKW|5|excellent
B00EPMBE22|5|This a quality TEE with the perfect message..
B00JSJ4AE6|5|Lovely shirt. Fully as expected.
B005540C7M|5|Purchased to go with a colorblocked dress. Color was perfect. Fit was perfec t and they are very comfortable.
B00AZ6LNMI|5|Fits,comfortable, inexpensive.  I have ordered a couple more shirts.  They make great sleepwear.  However, I suspect that they won't last forever.
B00IEQ95SK|4|I ordered the large for the length (I'm 5'10). The length is good, but it looks a little night gown ish. With a ribbon tied around it though it looks great!
B0088P40AA|5|Love this prpduct
B007F52GOQ|5|these are pretty nice, they're thicker than most socks at the heal and toe. I've had these for quite some time now, and to be honest I don't know how they're not destroyed by now.
B00I1LT35S|4|very good fit, & very soft,
B00AYQ9NKS|1|I bought these and I wore them for one day and they ripped. I bought a black pair as well. When I contacted the buyer, he stated that he was very poor and that he could only refund 7 dollars of my money and not a full refund. So I purchased these for 20 some dollars in total and wore them once and was refunded 7 dollars. Very unhappy and this is a complete waste of money.
B003UP68YE|4|Love the fit.
B00GPRWCYO|5|I bought these for my 45 year old daughter....a Duck Dynasty fan.  She loves them.  Her teenage daughter is into all kinds of funky and whimsical socks, so figured she'd probably want to wear them as well.
B005QB9XH4|4|Really happy with these. Comfortable, band is not tight, feel nice, but they seem to run small and shrank a bit in the wash.
B00076ZR3C|2|I wanted a tank top that would fit fairly snug. Judging from the picture of the shirt you would think the width of the shirt would be the same from top to bottom. I wanted at least something that fit well around my midsection (I am not pear-shaped).<br /><br />This shirt (if you can call it that) looks more like a blouse or even a woman's camisole.  Basically, it's about 50% wider at the bottom than the top  -  it flares at the bottom (bell-bottoms, anyone?) and I look like I'm wearing a tent.  And this is after washing it, hoping the shape would narrow.  It did not.  Could it be that they folded the sides when they took the picture?<br /><br />So, I'll wear it for sports (it seems more like a basketball shirt) but I am disappointed that I won't use it for the purpose for which I bought it. The search continues for a cotton tank top that does not look like an undershirt.
B00JL09HRM|5|I bought this to celebrate Jack is Back, but will continue wearing it. It's a comfortable fabric and flattering cut.
B007VDOK7S|4|I love the back neck grey area it makes it harder to stretch / stain
B000UNOK62|3|I like how the top fits, but the bottom seems tighter than I would like. White part is very sheer.
B00AWKKJ68|1|the dress was really pretty, but the sizes were not for my type and shaped body, so to those that can wear it good for you
B00FGVL4F8|5|It was a gift for a friend and she loved it.
B00B7Q8H74|1|Wrong size sent, no time to exchange it.. I did receive the correct size for the women's I ordered and that fit perfect. The material is very nice. an washes and drys very well ...
B00I03EQW2|5|This little outfit looks so perfect on my little one! Its super soft & washes very well. I absolutely LOVE this outfit & would for sure recommend it.<br />Mud Pie seriously makes adorable clothing for babies!
B009WE1YFA|5|It doesn't look leather in person, but I wasn't expecting it to. No breakage yet and I'm very happy with it for $10
B00N9ZGYIK|5|Nautica makes great pajamas (and other products), but I've switched over the their knits for my PJ's.  The fabric is soft and washes up without shrinking.  Just love 'em.
B00RLBVO0G|5|Just beautiful.  Such a bargain too!
B00P89RTQQ|5|Excellent!!!
B004A7XXXK|1|I selected the size according to the size charts and it turn out to be way too big, like two sizes up. Since I'm from Venezuela and its too complicated to return them I exchange it with my aunt and they fit her perfectely
B00GYHEUTU|5|Great looking skirt
B0002TOZ1O|5|the socks fit really good they feel thick and soft they work well with new shoes
B00HSHGPL6|5|its nice for the price. im bigger and it still fits me with room!
B00062NFJ0|5|Always trust the perfect fit and style of the CK briefs, now a little teeny spice of excitement (lol) with the grey ones
B008MB9668|5|I love it! I can't afford the real Burberry clothing and to me you can hardly tell the difference. It is super soft and comfortable it looks great, its a little shorter than I would like it but I am pretty picky. Other than the length I love it couldn't be more happy !
B005BTGAS6|5|Great
B00OIC9QF6|5|I love it, but it was a bit tight around the cuffs! The color is spot on! I wish I could have ordered it in all colors
B0073YQIG6|1|I can't believe how much smaller they run than other jeans I have bought. I couldn't even close them and then went out and bought a pair of Wranglers in the same size and they fit perfectly. Definitely returned them.
B00F3BHPCC|5|Wow! These are very well made pants - thick and warm and great looking! Not to add the great price and quick shipping! Typically wear a size 12 pants/jeans and ordered the 10 going by reviews,  fit perfect with enough room for layers although they are so think you won't need much! Waist is pretty high, but not such a bad thing for skiing! Very pleased!
B008UDBUHG|5|Great shirt!  I wanted to add more graphic Ts to my closet and since I'm a Spanish teacher, this Friday Kahlo is more than perfect.
B009HU7HF0|2|Purchased as birthday gift -- but it did not please and was passed on to someone else. Reason being -- the color was far more a brick red with a lot of brown tones overall than the luminous raspberry red in the picture.
B00IJQO45E|5|Love, they make my a** and crotch look amazing.
B009CTUBEU|5|Great product. Would recommend seller
B000N8X7A4|5|there great
B00H7STPE0|5|everyone loves this shirt thank you very much very happy with it
B000WCXM0Q|5|It was for my grandaughter she loved it and she looked great in it.
B000AQ9G3G|5|I LOVE MY NEW HAT!!! I ordered the Crystal Fox fur version of this hat and I am EXTREMELY pleased with the look. feel, and fit of it!<br />I have purchased many items from FursNewYork over the years and I have always been pleased and thrilled with every purchase. The High Quality fur, workmanship, and price could not be better than this anywhere else! I ALWAYS have a wonderful buying experience with this company.<br />Laurie Z. Penn Radcliff, KY
B00M1ID0J2|5|Size was too small for me but loved the product and made a perfect gift for a co-worker. Will definitely order more for gifts!
B00P0DQ09C|5|I just received my item today and I love it so far ..I ordered a extra large and it fits perfectly. .I weigh 190 and I'm 5'5 m and my waist is 34 inches So the chart is right
B005UN7SD4|5|love the product.  however I can't use it because the items I purchased to wear the products with are to small
B00WO065TY|5|Fit great.  Too cute
B005CPA7DI|4|When I ordered these socks I was concerned that \\"light brown\\" might be tan, but I was pleased to see that they definitely are brown (it's hard to see the color online).  The socks have a nice soft feel; you'd hardly know that they're wool.  My problem is with the elastic at the sock's top.  They're advertised as \\"non-binding,\\" which unfortunately seems to mean \\"so laid back they won't stay up.\\"  One of the pairs won't stay up after only two wearings.  Another pair seems a bit better, and might work out.  I have fairly large biker calves, but I don't know if that means I'm stretching out the elastic too much, or that it should make it even easier for a decent pair of stocks to stay up.  Bottom line, I'm not really happy with this outcome when I splurge on $10 socks.<br /><br />Update: It's been nine months since I bought these socks, and I want to give them an extra star (four...up from three). As mentioned in my first review, they do have a nice, soft, more like orlon than wool feel.  They are also reasonably warm, making them a nice sock for winter wear to work. They still have a slight tendency to be a little bit loose fitting, but that does avoid the binding feel of some wool socks.  I was concerned that the elastic would deteriorate over time, making the socks too loose fitting to wear, but that hasn't happened. They're pretty much the same as they were when they were new.  These are overall nice socks, and would be especially good for someone looking to avoid tight-fitting, binding socks.
B00FVJCCCE|5|Ordered this dress in XL and it was amaxing. I looked great and hid my troubled areas. I'm ordering the other color as well!
B005NRQWHA|5|These are so comfy and they keep me warm.  I have worn them several times in the few weeks since I got them.  Quality seems very good.
B00KBNMWX4|5|It fits perfect I wear a medium in everything but I got the &#34;free size&#34; I ordered three of the same skirts lol but I'm going to keep one and return the other two
B00JXCVUDM|5|Everything OK! excellent product and seller
B008X9ZDLG|3|Size is small. I would recommend ordering a bigger size.
B002K88IJ0|5|Our Traditional Women skirts/wrap around are amazing and one of its kind. Printed in gorgeous shades. Easy tie-up style. Fits well for all sizes. Pure Cotton. Washable in hand.
B00NQ3WZ06|3|I hate it when they sew thin tight elastic on top of panties that otherwise fit. I like the smooth look and this panty makes a noticeable dent along the top edge - you can see zig-zags in the pictures, that's where the elastic is. The next size up is too loose everywhere except the top elastic. Another inch of elastic would make these panties great! I only kept them because I have a bra of matching color (which I love! - Warner's Your Bra, highly recommend) but I won't be wearing them under anything thinner than jeans.
B00BJOXFOE|4|A tad too small...it's a large just not a large true to size, but still a great shirt!! It still looked great after first wash and didn't shrink any either which i was worried about. Like I said other than a tad bit too small it's an awesome shirt!!
B00SOJJSR0|5|Got a size 16 and was perfect! My daughter loves it! So pretty and comfortable. Perfect for spring/summer and very flattering!
B00FPFUBW2|4|Runs slightly small but the look is great and the hat is of very fine quality.
B00AA9Z7HW|1|Please know that this product runs very, very small.
B006VTDY3O|5|I am 5'11' with a 52\\" chest, 17\\" neck, 16\\" bicept, 33\\" waist, and  weighing 200 lbs.  I am athlethic built in the shoulders and chest.  This shirt fit perfectly as size large.  It is long enough to go past my belt for jeans and stretches enough to accomodate my size, but it not skini tight.  It is form fitting well.  The buttons are well sewn on.  The material is not overly thick so it doesn't make me sweat.  It is thick enough to not wear an undershirt, but does not show one if your wear a v-neck. I will buy another one/two soon.
B00UBG1QE2|5|Beautiful
B0092XAB64|5|Perfect!
B00C3CQ92Q|5|Perfect very fit I like it
B001283MAO|3|I am size 32 but this product was too large for me. I need size 30 next time. The quality is ok.
B00EPMIJ8O|5|Great shirt, good quality, will order another
B002U7Z31W|5|I just love Black Onyx, and was very happy to add to my collection, especially since I didn't have a necklace.  This will get a  lot of wear in 2012.  Also, the company that sent this item is a pleasure to do business with.
B0042UBFB2|3|The hat's perfectly good quality, but the brim was squished by being shipped in too small a box.  It's not a problem for my purposes - it's just a prop. But I would have been irritated if I was expecting to wear it.
B00J66HKA2|4|I read reviews that this runs really small and to order a size down... I had faith and didnt order down.  I'm a size 12, 5'10 and 168lbs.  This dress is the perfect length, just slightly above my knee. Arm holes are snug but not uncomfortable (this may have to do with my broad shoulders).  Fabric is soft, not scratchy.  The stretchy lace overlay is nicely done.  One drawback is that I'll need a slip even with nude covered undergarments.  Paid $30...Great deal!!
B00A1WDWQ6|5|My 2 sons share this hat. They both love wearing it! I really like that the glasses are soft and removable from the hat- it makes cleaning easy.
B008G6GTGY|4|Well made with all the little good stuff you come to expect from Carhartt. Been wearing Carhartt bibs  and they last under some tuff conditions
B00J3UQ3J0|3|Item arrived pretty quick unfortunately it was a little tight but i am trying to work with it.
B00K7P577E|1|Not worth what it would've cost me to ship back, so I kept it. But I would not wear it outside of the house.
B00K5T6P0U|1|Although this looks pretty the material is cheap and does not feel nice.....If you want a nice sweat shirt that is comfortable to wear I would pass  on this one...........
B00QLWF2FO|5|Awesome fit, my niece is all about these - glad I picked them up for her!
B00KRHJMYQ|4|I really do like the hat though I wish it was 100% cotton.  The print is colorful and tropical and I love it.  I love the print.  Very Aloha.  I does sit a little low on the head, and the leather strap is not leather its fake leather.  All in all it is a great buy for $10.00.
B0060JJOA2|5|Fits well, good quality
B00J7UOWYO|5|Love it great product shipped quickly
B00901KOTM|1|Horrible fit
B005CP4IGA|5|I had ordered this coat in grey and when it came it was too big. I had ordered a bigger size thinking I would be able to wear sweaters under it. But it really was too big so I sent it back the same day. I also emailed them and said I was going on vacation in less than a week and wondered if there was any way I could get a smaller size shipped in that amount of time. Since it was right before Christmas I didn't think I had any chance of getting it. To my surprise the coat came last night and we fly out tomorrow morning on vacation. I love the coat, it is so comfortable, great looking and fits perfectly! I also think Roaman's did a stellar job getting the coat to me. Great customer service and I won't forget it. I will be telling my family and friends what a &#34;class act&#34; they are!!
B00A7FQKJS|5|I have two covers and they are what I expected, they are great to use.
B0009MZXG0|4|My favorite trail running/hiking socks by far (and I do A LOT of those things).  Glad to find it here, on sale (sometimes...).
B007F5MONE|4|Love these, and have them in many styles, although this might be the prettiest. I did think the color would be more pink based on the photos. It's really a peachy beige.
B000EJVL5U|3|The cotton underwire does not have the same support as the wire &#34;underwire&#34; bras do, but it's okay.  If you are looking for comfort, this is the one ... if you need more support I would suggest an underwire with a wire.
B00JN5A5VW|5|Love  the dress!
B00JAFEPKC|5|Nice and warm for the cold weather in Minnesota and goes great with my winter coat
B008VTQAS8|4|Fits OK, but shrunk a little in the wash/dryer.<br />Love The Style and Print!<br />Mostly Satisfied!<br />I would purchase the item again.
B00HQC9GTQ|2|Very thin material, looks cheap to wear it
B00LFJ5F7S|1|This is clearly not for a tall person and a person with big boobs!!! They said it runs small take a size up I did and it still didn't fit!
B000BB7VYQ|5|Perfect for early spring cold and wet weather in NY. Folds up compact. Looks nice on. Washes up well.
B00A2IDUTI|4|Bigger than I had anticipated, but also prettier than I thought it would be.  I'm keeping it.
B00MJO65RM|5|Regal very rich looking tie
B000KK0OLA|1|Well, the title says it all. The tag says 100% cotton! but if it is! it's a crazy rough kind of cotton like I've never experienced before. The waistband feels like razor blades on your skin, I rolled it down and it felt better, but even the rest of the short is like sandpaper, it rubs you raw everywhere it can touch skin. I bought 2 pair :(, my wife is mad at me, but I'll never wear them, I'll probably throw them in the garbage because I just wouldn't feel right giving them to someone, they are that bad.
B00D7T7D8I|5|Very surprised at the overall quality of this hat, all of my other trucker style hat are simple cheaply made which I expect from a trucker hat so I was very happy with this hat.
B003ZV4CJG|4|I like the levi's jeans but they really don't like me.  the waist is always too big and the legs are always tight.
B005JJT544|2|I'll be honest- not thrilled with this coat. I ordered a size down from my normal size and it is still huge. I just feel like a box in it. Just not attractive on me at all. I am mainly wearing it for shoveling now. When shoveling, I noticed I was warm with a sweater underneath on top, but my legs and butt were getting cold by the time I was done. I am in Wisconsin though.
B00LBW8V66|5|It was perfect, Came within expected arrival and all these compliment headed my way!! It somehow fits the 2-3 2.5 inch binders and both of my textbooks perfectly. And it seems water proof and durable! I love the softness on the outside and it doesnt seem like it would last but it is! I highly recommend! :D
B007IDNUTA|5|Very nice sweatshirt, really thin material, light weight, excellent quality.<br />My son loved it so much, Im going to order the same one in different colors
B008XDYSFE|5|Great pajama set. Fits perfectly. Son is huge fan of Mickey and loves this set.  The top is perfect for winter with long sleeves.  Material is not too heavy or too light and perfect for sleeping under covers.
B00EYCG0OA|5|This shirt came in on time, it was actually early and it was shipped nice and the material of the shirt is great it's not cheap looking and the size was perfect. I was 100% satisfied. Would definitely order from them again.
B001FFMD7M|2|Good looking but tight in the thighs. Probably wont end up wearing.
B00BYNENQE|1|It is so short you need to wear slacks or jeans under. Very poorly made, no tags. Wish it worked
B00LEUCF08|5|Oh, I love it! Comfy, comfy, comfy! We live in the boonies, on a dead end road and have a driveway alarm,  so not much chance of anyone slipping in unannounced. So I put this on as soon as it arrived one gloriously sunny, pleasant day and twirled around outside feeling like a queen. I kept it on while hanging laundry (this queen loves line drying) and doing my household chores because it is SO comfortable! I have to see if there are regular daytime clothes made with this fabric, it feels so lovely. I suppose with a nice belt or sash it could very well suffice as a cute dress. I love it just the way it is no matter what time of day or night I wear it!
B004UQV5P4|5|Soft material, great colors, perfect fit, true to size, great gift. Holds up really well. Highly recommend this hoodie for anyone
B00GZH8OHS|5|Its so adorable!!!!! My daughter picked it out for her little brother who is due at the beginning of next month and we absolutely love it.
B009OKHFPA|4|I think the price may be a bit too high for a long sleeved t-shirt, but I really wanted one in beige to match an outfit that i had, and this is the only one I could find. So, the color is different than the picture, but it's actually much better looking in person. The lighting in the picture makes it look dumpier than it actually is (I think they darkened it to make the model look tan). The shirt itself is really nice quality, I mean nothing to write home about, it's just a long sleeve t-shirt, but I'm really happy with the thickness of the material, and it's not transparent at all. The fit is really nice, it come in a bit around the waist rather than just being a tube. I would definitely be ordering this in more colors if the price came down a bit.
B00CJ55MYS|5|I bought this for my friend's daughter, she likes is very much. Great price for a nice dress like this. Unique design!<br />Very sweet!
B00M3ZKLBI|4|Great they came early and fit great
B00553XMGQ|3|This bra doesn't give me the support I hope it would've given me. And when it's cold outside it shows too much (if you know what I mean). Oh well.
B009T4A8XC|5|just like the pic
B005GZR6BK|5|Excellent
B00AC6W7CG|5|Love it! It's a smidge pricey for what you get but i do love it. I would order more  if the prices come down.
B00JUM6D82|5|Great for the price. Well-made and comfortable.
B00MF00AG2|4|The cups are a little weird but it works!
B00E8SDC6E|4|I wore this to my sisters wedding. I got a lot of complements.  Very good price and the stitching was well done.  The only thing i will say is it was a little to long for me.  I'm 5'4 and it came down passed my knees, but that's easily fixed.
B004U0IRGU|5|Bright LED'S works good so far, Glove not the best but does the job. I bought two more after buying one and trying it out for Night Light Painting for Photography. Works good. Thanks
B00W8FSV92|1|I gave this 1 stars only for the design which is awesome. As far of the quality, this product stinks. It is so cheaply made and flimsy that the metal loops bent and separated from the buckle which rendered it totally useless.  I returned this immediately and would advise not buying this product. The lesson learned is that you get what you pay for.
B00K6EC1PW|3|It was very cute, but the back was completely see-through--I couldn't even wear a nude thong! And it was very, very short. I was hoping for something at least mid-thigh length, but it barely covered my butt and fit more like a shirt.
B000LV7EFC|4|this fits as expected for a 36 C, not too tight. the reason I took off 1 star was bc there are seams that run along the front of each breast, why would they do that??? you can see it a little in the pic and it doesnt seem too noticeable. HOwever, when i wear this bra with certain work out tops, its very apparent. its not my fav look. If I wear it under a looser fitting top, its not so bad.
B00GRHY35S|2|The fit is nice but it is completely see-through (at least the white one is).  It's hard to find an undershirt the same shape as this shirt to wear.  Not worth the $30 to me. Material should've been thicker.
B00JFIXCH6|5|Very Impressed
B001H0F3HW|4|I find it hard to find inexpensive drywick type shirts, this one might have been a wee bit too large, but I'm kind of in between shirt sizes right now. It performs adequately, and drys quickly. I'd recommend it, though I still hunt for the perfect dry shirt.
B00KDK1ELG|5|Love the color.  Perfect fit.
B008TVCS02|1|These lounging pants are of poor quality.  I needed to do a minor alteration on them which was a nightmare due to the flimsiness of the fabric and the shedding was ridiculous. Would not recommend these to anyone. The next time I will stay with good old fashioned cotton flannel--and check carefully to see where (the country) the product was manufactured. These pants are now in the trash---hard lesson learned!
B00IFEGB3S|5|I cut the sleeves off and now it is the centerpiece of my wardrobe.
B0040EX0E0|4|I wish I hadn't had to pay for shipping (hence 4 stars) but I love my TNG shirt and don't regret the purchase.<br />The shirt is soft and stretchy, however, there is not much room in the chest area so .... Ladies if you are top heavy I'd go with a large instead of a medium.<br /><br />FYI the shirt is constructed in El Salvador.<br /><br />Will update if the image doesn't last, but it seems like it will.<br /><br />....<br /><br />Almost a year later: the image still going strong! And I wear the hell out this shirt.
B002IRIGUE|3|I bought these to go with my Egyptian Halloween costume, so I knew I was buying cheap costume jewelry. I ordered them gold, but they are silver.
B00FG2K958|4|I PURCHASED THIS PURSE AND I REALLY LIKE IT,ITS SMALL SO I HAD TO DOWN SIZE,I WISH IT CAME IN A BIGGER SIZE,BUT ITS REALLY WORTH BUYING.
B004UULJNS|2|This piece was horribly constructed. One of the loops holding the lace up front ties ripped immediately as I tried to tie the bow, and I was not using much force. Upon closer inspection, the whole seam of the bodice looked like it was ready to tear. I didn't even bother wearing this item, as it probably would have fallen apart had I tried to dance. I returned the item.
B00BAX3A9Y|5|The XL fit great and look great.  I am not a chef but I love cooking and find these are perfect when I am creating in my kitchen or just hanging around the house. When I first tried these on they seemed a bit baggy in the rear but once I washed them they were perfect.  I have an apple shape and I would think that someone with a pear shape might fine that they are tight in the rear.     I will be buying another pair.
B00EE4FMOC|4|i will be using this after i have my son (due april 1st) i ordered a large thinking that since the girl in the photo is tiny as hell it would probably fit like a medium... its pretty damn big lolso hopefully it will work for me still after i have my son. i will update my review if it does not.<br /><br />as of now though , the material seems sturdy and light weight, not itchy or anything.
B00L42YJCI|3|Nice material. Should have sized up. With a little tweaking will fit better. Fast delivery!
B00U8H0P64|5|Sharp Skirt-<br /><br />I saw this Skirt on line, and I knew that I had to purchase it.  When I received it, I just loved it even more.  The size that I had gotten, was a little large so I returned it for a smaller size.  Just love it.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />F.E. Manuel
B00WYEQYBY|2|The shorts are fine, as long as you understand that these are essentially children's sizes. I ordered the large (12 - 14, according to Amazon's size chart) and they fit my perfectly normal sized 12 year-old niece just fine.
B0015GP8CS|5|fits great
B00AQDAUBK|4|I had to purchase a white polo for a new job I started at the time. The fit is much looser than what is shown on the model. That was a plus for me since I like my clothes to be a little loose. This shirt is sheer like most white shirts, so I advise wearing a white shirt underneath. The fabric is pretty soft and comfortable to wear for 8+ hours a day.
B00I3VXBK4|3|Just what I was expecting!
B00H8JRRCK|4|I absolutely love this sweater! Its nice, big, and comfy just like it should be. I wish the arms were little longer.
B00BBWB3PM|4|Cute top! It seems more like a sweatshirt from the images, but it's actually a thin, long sleeved shirt. I normally wear small-- I ordered a small and it fit me perfectly. It is snug and flattering, but not skin tight.
B00QBEW3AO|3|For a petite person I am only 4'10 it's pretty long. I just got it yesterday.the shipping was really fast! My advice? Don't wear it too long, if you can't handle it anymore because you will have a headache.i am 34 and using a Small/32 so that I could achieve 23&#34; waistline in the last hook
B00L4JEH9G|5|Im 5'2 150lbs this fits perfectly.  Soft and beautiful.
B0050KTRUY|5|Thank u it arrive fast n good i like it alot
B00K57BHYG|5|I have spent money on expensive cotton briefs and after trying these I won't be doing that ! they're perfectly comfortable and light and pretty =)
B00CF2VWGW|1|Oh but it shrinks badly.
B00BCC7V5M|5|I didn't wear it yet, just tried, and I like everything: how it is made, how it feels, how it looks. Very light, stretchy lace, silky on the inside. Usually I wear 36B, but this one is 36C. For bigger breasts cups will stretch, but I wanted something very comfortable, and it is.  I guess, cups are not full C size. I already had an old one that my sister gave me years ago, and it is my favorite to wear at home. Milavitsa is made in Belorussia and has a quality that you may find on the high end because for that part of the world $20-40 for a bra is expensive, and presupposes good workmanship.<br /><br />I expect my friend bring me more from her trip home, and may add how other bras are comparing to this one. Right now I'm happy even if $29 (price with shipping) is not cheap for me.
B00PN4Y8VK|5|Beautiful, I love it.
B00E56WW6K|5|One of the best pants I purchased.
B002R0FE2K|5|We needed these quick for an upcoming dance competition out of town.  They not only arrived on time but fit perfectly and looked great.  Saved the day!<br />Very satisfied customer!
B00QV54J5U|5|Very cute skirt for my little one. She's a size six in other clothes and it fit well. We rolled the waist down once as she's a little short but this will be fine by summer. Very soft material.
B00631VPT0|4|Giving this as a Christmas gift, I can't really rate it . But it is very pretty, just what I expected...
B0007M8ZR6|5|ah man. i have 2 vote for pedro shirts. there both awsome. i would wear this shirt anywere...... even to a wedding or something. it makes me happy when i wear it.
B00A1BTDOM|5|Fit great and looked amazing on
B0029F269C|5|I own a couple of Scala hats.  They're always worth your money and most importantly, they wear well.  So well that while attending the TCM Film Festival in L.A. a couple of weeks ago, I was stopped several times by ladies with a whole lot of positive comments.  We were even interviewed by TCM staff after viewing a movie, and when I said to my husband that I wondered why they chose us, he said, it's that hat.  You look like a million dollars in it!  Not bad, I say!!
B009PBV69O|4|Purchased about a year ago, comfortable, cool for summer.  Only lost 1 star because the fabric wore so thin on the back that it ripped out in a was that wasn't reparable. It is a fine cotton, almost handkerchief weight, so plus / minus still a nice summer gown.
B00HJ9JQ82|3|I like them. Just too bad they are short. I have to send them back. I wish they did fit.
B003ZZ8Q1W|5|This is just what my niece needed! Super cute, and a good deal.
B00SLDP166|1|I had it ordered twice,L size originally,i've received M size both times,which have also arrived late.
B002SW3DNO|3|Baby don't like to wear it
B0009PCXII|3|The blouse is very nice and true to fit.  It's very thin though, you would need to wear a tank or camisole underneath it.
B00EPQ8318|5|Love the band, shirt is comfortable and feels amazing. This shirt, is so flippin dope, everyone is jelly of it.
B00ET1V60Y|3|I did not get the colors expected.  Please, please, make underwear in black, white, beige, and maybe pink or gray!
B00DGM4WNK|5|this outfit is too cute - the hat is just too much! I love it. I bought several of these, in different animals and they're all adorable and perfect, inexpensive play clothes. Gerber runs a tad big - not huge but my baby definitely grew into this one.
B002MAA06A|4|This item is very cute. Fits well, and I am 5'4 about 110 lbs. Doesnt do much to flatter size A, but its still cute.
B004R8Q01O|4|Dickies smallest waist for this is 30\\" and is loose on me, so beside that, the look is nice but the jeans ride a lot lower than the regular fit stds - not quite my style. Fit and finish is OK but not as good as older jeans from 10 or so years back. For a normal ride waist go with the relaxed and loose fits which fit me perfectly (with a belt that is).
B00EP2WZ2K|5|great product
B00GQVC4EM|5|Crazy good deal!!
B00LSAW720|5|This is the perfect shirt to wear at home, running errands or to watch your kids play sports.  It is not dress enough to wear out on a date, but it is ideal to wear the rest of the time!  I love it so much that I bought a back up one!
B00LO71KPW|2|The One I've got bigger than I've ordered
B00EVI1RWM|4|I got this in a timely matter knowing it was coming for China. Dress is very thick and well made. I am 120 and 5'3 the xs fit me perfect.  Problem was that after wearing it once the little stones started falling down and the color isn't exactly as the picture.
B001NXL1PQ|5|Good quality
B00GFH4LXE|5|I purchased this for my granddaughter and she loves it. It was difficult to find a nightgown of this quality.
B00B31W5TE|2|Next time I'm checking size charts before buying a new brand. Seriously, this is just strange. Don't get me wrong, I know my size very well, and I know how to order different sizes for different cuts. I don't like wasting money or time on returns, so I typically check reviews before ordering something off of Amazon. I normally straddle the XL-XXL size for shirts and, after checking reviews, I figured XXL was a safe bet. Little did I know that Ben Sherman is just flat out not meant anyone with a BMI over 18! If you wear XL-XXL on a chiseled frame (read: lots of gym time!), then you won't have a problem, otherwise, find another brand. Here's why...<br /><br />I normally wear 17.5\\" 34/35 dress shirts. If I deviate from that, it's to get an 18\\" neck on a slim cut, and I don't mind having a bit of excess in the shoulder/neck on these so that I can get the right slim-but-comfortable cut at the arms and waist. So, if we take a gander at the Ben Sherman size chart for their \\"normal\\" fit shirts, we see that the XXL is a 17.6\\" neck with 26.8\\" sleeves and 19.8\\" shoulder width (which should be the equivalent of a dress shirt sleeve length of somewhere between 34 and 38 inches). Ok, so my 17.5\\" 34/35 size should translate to the XXL normal size for Ben Sherman, right? Nope. The problem is in the rest of the cut. Let's take, for example, the Calvin Klein sizing chart. We have the regular fit dress shirt with a 17.5\\" neck with a 55\\" chest and 53\\" waist... I'm pretty sure that'd be a little baggy on me, but that's what you'd expect from a normal cut. Now let's look back at the Ben Sherman size chart... the XXL has--WHAT?!--a 48\\" chest and 47\\" waist?! You mean to say that the \\"normal\\" cut of a Ben Sherman shirt takes off 6 inches of room throughout the midsection that you'd get in another brand?! Yes, indeed. So, the \\"normal\\" cut for Ben Sherman, to which cut does that correspond in a Calvin Klein shirt? Let's see, the next down from the regular fit are the \\"Steel Fit\\" and \\"Body Fit,\\" both of which are a chest/waist of 52\\"/50\\"... not there yet. Next is the slimmest CK shirt, the \\"X Fit,\\" at 50.5\\"/45.5\\". I guess that's the closest you get, with a larger chest than Ben Sherman's normal fit and a slightly narrower waist. Clearly, what Ben Sherman considers \\"normal\\" is in fact, very slim. And, ok, that's fine, they can be one of the companies that only caters to slim people. Now I know, and the hassle of returning the shirt is enough to teach me the lesson of checking size charts FIRST.<br /><br />I'd like to give the item I got a 1* for said hassle of returning it, and for the fact that the shirt is very plain (i.e. if it did fit, it'd still be 3-4*)... but, they'll get 1* back simply because I didn't do complete research on the company. I mean, it's not like the info wasn't out there somewhere, but as far as general customer service philosophy goes, it's maybe a little too much to ask your customers to find out that you're a bit of an exception on their own... a customer service grey area I guess.
B00HY0PBLC|5|Cute shirt!  It was just a tad small, but overall very cute shirt.
B004VO7UJA|2|The colors are misrepresented.  The blue and brown socks are very dark and indistinguishable from black without a light right next to them.  The gray is darker as well but still looks gray.<br /><br />Also, 10-13 is too big if you wear shoe sizes up to 10.  I wear a size 8 and I can see the heel part on the sock next to my ankles.<br /><br />These feel nice though but it's not worth me returning.  If you know what you're getting, you may be satisfied!
B004CO7WCE|1|Fits fine but is not the lavender and white pictured here so was NOT happy about that. Bait and switch on the color. Be careful ordering.
B00KBZSTAW|4|Still Hot
B00EEE9O3M|5|I bought these jeans along with the blue ones in the same style; they are very comfortable and are especially great to wear in the summer months;  as I stated in my review of the blue ones,  they do need to be adjusted (pulled up) every once in awhile as they become a bit loose in the waist when worn awhile. Still, it is very nice to find high waisted jeans that look fashionable as well as being very comfortable; I love them.
B00BSLENSA|5|As described, good quality, works well.  I removed the elastic connector for the slide out mini-wallet had to the main.  Easier for me to use that way.
B006IYJ5GM|4|Great work wear for medical professionals, nicely priced and decent quality.
B002IKLY8W|3|For what I paid, it is a pretty nice shirt but comes out of my dryer VERY wrinkled.
B004Y9OO64|4|the quality of the product itself is good, what was not good was that it was unstitcked. I think someone should have checked the product before it was delivered!!!
B00HHYHZJQ|5|Nice thick hoodie with soft lining inside. This fits my 7 year old perfectly, but he is a skinny guy.  Love the two-different colored zipper - one side red and the other white.  Embroidered baseball logo on chest, nothing on back.
B00ADHJTA2|5|I love it more every time I wear it. The fit is great and washes without losing color or embellishment.
B005QBGPCK|5|I absolutely love it. I feel it looks better than I expected it too. The quality of the material seems to be really good. I bought this for a gift for someone and havent given it to them yet. I am sure they will love it. I would recommend this product. I do plan to buy another one for a gift when that time comes.
B0071MKP8C|4|This jacket has a playful lining pattern of Mustaches and Panda bears that look like camo.  It seems well constructed and works well as a light weight rain jacket.  I'm very happy with this jacket.  It is designed well and has a great cut.
B001MXJ9KQ|3|Very cute but far too big even though it is listed to fit a newborn even at 2.5 months old.  It's also well made and warm. By the time we were finished trying it on our son was a bit uncomfortable and hot.
B00CHR9MGC|5|I bought 2 of these sets (this colour & the Mint Green) for my 2 daughters. Both are beautiful colors and my girls love them. I would say they probably run true to size as my 2 daughters are 5yrs tall and slim and 3yrs average height but more stocky and the size 4 fit both really well. They are a little bit more expensive than I would have liked but couldn't find anything else as cute. Totally recommend.
B008QV88RM|5|This outfit is beautiful the quality of the material is good, the tights are just regular tights but the details on the tunic are so cute. My daughter wore it for Christmas eve party and everyone was complimenting her and asking me where I got it from. So it is a beautiful outfit.
B004SK6CAK|4|Ordered this for my dad, he really likes the design. Would buy again.
B00HZ0OPVS|4|Expected delivery day was between 9/20-9/26 bit they arrived today which made me very happy! Packaged in a very nice and professional way and came with a free nail file. I saw reviews that they were smaller than expected so I got a large...much too big I wish I would have just gotten medium. I might return them but that depends if I'm able to free up the resources to do that, if not ill probably give them to my sister who's a little bigger than me. These look nice but I don't love the material, I'm used to much softer clothing BUT I haven't washed these yet (because I'm not sure if I'm returning) and maybe that will make a difference. I love the cut but am not crazy about the large fabric line going down the front of each pant leg. I will update when I have better information to give, for now, 4 stars, id make it 4.5 if I could. Shout out to this small business for allowing e to try their pants at a discount for my honest review!
B00CPT1T9U|5|Love this!! It's cute and comfortable. Super pleased with this purchase.
B00MG4NZ1Y|4|Pretty but also very long. I will need to fix the bust area.
B00H2VOJ2A|2|Didn't look as nice as I thought, kept slipping off my daughters hair
B00GICLT3G|5|Material is SO soft.
B00280M5XA|5|The fit is perfect for my body.<br />It lifts in the right places and is very comfortable because the straps do not bind.
B00JIH6IAW|2|Too small not a regular size pants
B00NX51F80|5|This is the most comfortable, flattering, and darling shirt one can own. The sleeves are long enough so you don't look like short sleeved wonder, and the material is light enough you can use it for more weather conditions than others. Love it!! I may have to order another right now..
B0037KMI1Y|5|These tights are a perfect fit for my 7 yr old daughter. She has them in nude and the black fit exactly the same (which is what I was hoping for). This brand is very good quality and lasts through many washings and wear. Extremely satisfied with my purchase!
B00WE7WYCY|1|it's garbage. it was a hassle to return so I just kept it.
B009WS5S6C|4|Love it. Very full scarf.
B008P7BWBG|2|for grand daughter..she does not like<br />& neither do i..it is cheat looking
B001GH13RK|4|My only critique with this product would be that the straps were not attached well to the dress - both came undone the first time I wore the dress because there were only a few threads attaching them.
B008MTR03G|3|I love this brand and usually they are consistent with their sizes, but this ran so big!! It has great material and quality, but it stretches a lot...especially the bottom. Unfortunately, it doesn't shrink in the wash after stretching. I would recommend because it's still great quality.
B0000BNEQJ|5|I wish I could live in these tights. They are the perfect capri length and provide a good blend of breathability and warmth. I've only had them for a month (September) and have used them during different types of weather (cold and hot). I typically wear a size 6 and bought the medium, which fit great! Definitely recommend.
B0000733OV|5|This is a great bag. I bought it for the gym. Very cool feature is that the shoes store underneath the clothes in a separate compartment. Plenty of room for gym clothes in center. Side compartments can carry shower materials if needed. I highly recommend this bag, this bag beats the heck out of others several times the price.
B008QYZNTU|5|The fabric is just so soft, its dreamy. One of my favorites. Lets face it the price is a little steep. But totally worth it!. The neckline shoes off a little more than I would like. My husband LOVES it. I did have to buy a really big statement necklace to cover what seemed to me to be a lot of territory... but that just meant I got to shop some more...yeah. Would totally buy one in every color and wear them every day, if I didn't think I'd look like a fool doing so. Makes me wish I traveled for a living so I could do just that.
B006SRTDQ6|4|Warm and nice to have something that doesn't expose my waiste to the weather when working outside.
B00CU6IK5E|1|Looked cheap and off white.
B00M24NKVI|5|Great fit, and I particularly like the length.  Fabric is soft and very comfortable. I am delighted.
B00EVBQAH6|4|Their claims about being able to downsize your existing wallet into a smaller form factor are true.  I'm enjoying the trimmer profile of my new wallet, and the only reason 5 stars were not given is because the leather is somewhat slick/slippery, such that I've dropped it several times when pulling it out or putting it into my pocket.  It just takes a bit of getting used to.
B00KSR2E1I|5|They car so cute & comfortable !
B0050DMP3C|2|Although the seller's customer service was excellent, the product is not \\"boutique quality\\".  My problems with the bows:  1.  Clip is just clipped to bow.......so if a child pulls on the bow in her hair, the entire bow slides off the clip.....leaving an ugly metal clip in her hair.............I have gone through and put a bead of hot glue on each bow attaching the clip to the bow........this, done by the manufacturer would have made them a little closer to \\"boutique quality\\".  2.  Clips are not positioned properly on the bow - perhaps they were at first but since they were not glued, they slide around.  Most of my bows arrived with the clip almost on the side of the bow rather than the bottom.
B00KDFKVUQ|5|nice fit
B00J8FVAK2|5|I'm in my late twenties and I bought this dress in black floral to use for a Halloween costume. I really wish it was still the 1950s so I could wear this style all the time! It was a bit expensive for a homemade costume - but I WILL find some other occasion for this dress.<br /><br />At the time I wore this I was hovering between size 12-14 dresses and the XL was a great fit, very flattering, slimming at the waist while covering up the areas I'm most self conscious about! I did wear a short petticoat under the skirt for a bit more volume. The belt was a bit smaller than the dress, so beware, but it still fit (tightly) adding more drama to the waistline. The fabric had a nice density to it which helped reinforce the overall quality of the item. I received several compliments on the dress and I would definitely recommend this purchase.
B001RCTCP4|5|Pretty shirt with some texture. My favorite part about it is the collar. Unlike most shirts in my wardrobe this one always stays rigid without ironing or starch. It also remains wrinkle free, removing the need to iron it and allowing one to dress up with minimal effort.
B00HVKO5IU|1|Size is super small and wrong. Will never buy again. Had to return it and pay for return!!!!!!!
B00LNN1KOI|5|This is nice but a size larger will fit perfectly..
B00NUZDDTM|1|Not just too small. WAY too small!  I even ordered a size larger.  In addition, the sleeves were extremely long and terribly tight.  Sadly, I ordered three and will be giving them to a friend who is a very tiny person, and they might not work for her.  Just a bad purchase.
B0051U17K6|4|I have 3 pairs of these socks now. It does the job and are not too thick, they do not restrict the kind of shoes you can wear. The fit well and the overall quality is good.
B009F6HNG4|5|I loved them, they were just the right thickness for all year round, I can wear them with my uniforms and on weekends!
B00A16E0FO|5|is a flattering and beautiful dress, for the office or a happy hour, goes with all colors of shoes. I totally recommend it!♥
B00390ATC2|5|Very soft and no issues with quality.
B00K1LP4OK|2|It's nice
B00IZ8LCQA|4|These are cut smaller than the Synrgy shirts or others you might find from Casual Male - not nearly as small as the ones from Cubavera, but still too small...
B006H1LETM|5|Gave this to my hubby and we both have a peace of mind his credit cards are protected. It has enough card slots and two bill compartments and window for his ID. Would recommend and reorder again.
B00AZRL4L2|2|Love the fabric but these jeans were enormous.  I normally wear a 25 or 26 but these were too big in a 24.  I know the fit is supposed to be &#34;easy&#34; but they fell down.  I couldn't order them smaller since this was the smallest size.
B00JA4T9DG|4|I love these jammy pants!  soft fabric, well stitched, NO FLY!  awesome!
B00ZZQF8Y2|1|It was very cheaply made.
B00080NYU0|5|I bought this wallet as a thin alternative to take out to the bars and clubs. I've had it for about a month now and it's holding up great. It fits the essentials and is exactly what I was looking for.
B007ZYP8YC|3|The stock goes up to my knee and stays there.  The heel cuts into my foot and is painful.  Nothing I do seems to make a difference, still the heel cuts into my foot and leaves a very sore indent.  So, I am not sure if the fit is somewhat small or it just doesn't fit the shape of my foot.
B0031U0PJ2|5|I have buying Carhartt products for years add love all of them. They're well made and very durable. I'm sure it will last a long time.
B001R4CAO2|4|Maybe these socks run a little large.  Anyway the 8-9 size were too large for my granddaughter who wears a size 12 shoe.  But they are nice quality.  I ordered the next smaller size, so we'll see if they fit.
B00T27YXFU|3|Was delivered on time and well packed. They fit a bit snug and the waist band does not stretch much.
B00E0IJXN8|5|This is one of my favorite purchases of the last few months.  The sweater is beautifully made and the fabric is super soft and comfortable.  It is my go-to sweater for weekends.  I ordered a large instead of medium and I am glad I did because I don't feel comfortable in sweaters which are too tight around the bust.
B008YU8VO0|4|I love this product but wish it was a tad bigger when I first received it.  The only other option to the S/M was M/L and I'm no where close to a L so I think it would be too big so I kept it.  It has worked out well. Lightweight for warmer months. Want to order more.
B000NDD9KC|5|I ordered this shirt for a space thememed Christmas play. We have Star Trek fans in our congregation, so decided to Trek it up. This shirt is the perfect replica of the Star Trek uniforms. Our church Christmas play is going to be over the top, thanks to Amazon for offering affordable costumes. Great quality!
B00FRMEHDC|4|it fit very well and that's all i care about he will grow out of it in a week anyways.
B000SSHK6Q|5|I bought two of these as gifts and they were great. The quality was good and very dueable for a teen.
B00NBHNL28|3|very cheaply made.  had a strange smell to it.  the lining on the hood was coming undone so I pulled it out.  the fabric was also sort of hard not very soft.  I had to wash it a couple of times (to get the smell out) in order to make it softer.  my daughter loves it so I guess that's all that matters.
B00DVLBS5Q|4|Great shirt.
B004FKKB3C|3|This shirt is made of rough thin fabric I was hoping for the price it would have been better quality.
B00XQNVGQK|5|A+
B00GSKHI5G|5|If you love Sons, you must get this sweatshirt.  Great seller, fast ship.
B00201Y80A|5|Very nice.
B0043WM3KG|4|As the name says, this is very much a MICRO MINI.  However, the tulle can be stretched gently to make it longer (except at the seams).  I got an extra three inches from both layers when it stretched (MUST do it GENTLY).  Costume quality implies that the tulle may not be without holes and the seams may not be sewn as securely as a professional grade one would be.  Yet, as a costume quality, it's not bad.  It's only going to give you a bit of fluff around your butt & hips.  I give it four stars since the seams are not fully sewn but the rest is nice.  It will give my mini costume an extra fullness that will camouflage any panty that shows.  If you want something that looks more like the picture, get two.  If you want it to cover your thighs, get a different model.
B00AAU3H9Q|4|I bought this for my granddaughter's birthday;  to dress up in w/her matching 3&#34; Cinderella Doll.  The night gown was just as pretty as the picture.  I know she will love it.
B00IEKAJGS|3|Product did not specify men or women........i assumed that it was unisex..........ordered a medium (which stated that it was 100% cotton) in hopes if too big it would shrink..it turned out to be 60% polyester, 40% cotton....VERY CUTE pants...just hoping they will fit when opened on Christmas! If not.........oh well,  don't have time to reorder.
B0034G65Q0|5|Great cotton thongs!<br />They fit perfect. Love the 100% cotton material. They washed very well.<br /><br />Why did you stop carrying it? So sad....
B00Q86VI4C|3|The quality of the product is not so good, and it is so small that when I try it on, it gets &#34;see trhouwy&#34;, the tshirt looks nice enough.. when I don't have it on, won't ever be able to use it, I guess I have now a gift for... well, I'll figure it out :/
B00I2Z7DKU|4|I liked the fit of the socks on my child but there were a few snags in the socks when I got them.
B00DTULVWO|4|Looks good but it tends to get caught in the buckle when passing it through.  Fortunately there's a hole in the back to push it up and out of the way.
B0043RD36O|4|Though the Tee is a tad thin, it isn't so bad that you need to wear anything under it. The fabric is super soft too! I bought the X Large & glad because any smaller wouldn't have fit. I'm 5'8\\" 148 lbs, 36B, and its comfortable on me & doesn't look big at all. Its so pretty I LOVE it!  The design could have been a tad bigger on the X Large, but I really don't think it is noticeable.  The shipping was super fast too!
B00GAO8SVS|5|Nice shirt - reasonably priced. I bought it for cold weather wear under my uniform shirt.
B00KLT7HD8|3|Nice Gift
B00SIHT2AQ|5|I am medium-size but I always buy an extra large.
B00CBR84XA|4|This was a gift for my 18 month old. It's super cute and stylish. It's held up well and she's not easy on clothes. The shirt is a little thin but it's perfect for our mild winters in Texas.
B008R96MNU|5|I love it - the fit is great.
B00DQYY9TK|5|One of the best bags I've owned. Can be used for your laptop or tablet with plenty of room for attachments and a medium sized binder. Very nice shoulder strap to.
B00KZMD99C|5|The dress is very beautiful and comfortable
B009YPW9SI|2|&#34;Resists wrinkles&#34; my foot. I have found the exact opposite to be true. Needs ironing to get rid of what looks like a permanent crease at the knees perpendicular to the length.
B00GZZQRFQ|4|guess not right for my body type - ordered a large (size 10) and i'm 5'6&#34; and 155 pounds, just didn't fit correctly. cute suit though
B00RZ42XLI|4|Beautiful dress, it's very short!!
B00O8DAHX0|5|can't wait til it's cool enough to wear it again!
B000IMZVGS|5|Bought as a gift, recipient loved it.
B001NHEC9E|5|This tie seems to be high quality and is colored precisely as shown.  Great with blues or other dark solid-color shirts.
B00LN26E9K|1|way to small torn in places, looked like someone took out seems to make larger. yuck
B0030IU8XI|5|Durable , sizing by seller good, cleans easy& dries fast . Hard to believe I actually have to buy pants based on smart phone carrying capability , that's reality today! The WP592 is the ultimate solution.<br />BTW- Kaki hides way better in daily general use , than the Blue , unless you're working with petroleum products.<br />Dickies, please add add'l colors/ selections to WP592 product line
B002M87VFU|5|Well, that's just it. I've bought these for my daughter and they proved to be irreplaceable for all sorts of winter activities (snow tubing, mountain skiing or just some time in a snow). Kept her dry and warm w/o being excessively bulky. Great product.
B00L27YDCQ|5|Looks really cute and well made
B00GPPCP9I|2|Cute color blocking but the fit was not flattering for a curvy figure. The material and lining was too clingy.
B0058YRJUW|4|Comfortable and roomy, great for the trekking. Active waistband allows for better fit but didn't realise that medium is still a little loose for my size 32 waist. Will be better if item comes in waist sizes instead of S, M, L. Will go for small the next time I buy.
B00ZOZAS8U|5|Excellent fit, nice casual ware my girlfriend loved it
B0052BAIGS|5|This is exactly what I was looking for to do yard work and go to the Garden Center in. Great fit and love the color!!!
B007YBDKZK|5|Wow this dress is amazing, especially considering the price! I love the wrinkle free fabric, and the fact that it is a halter and can be adjusted somewhat because of the fact that you are tying the straps.  The pads in the top are adequate so that no bra is necessary, for me at least.  I usually wear a 34 C cup. Wonderful travel dress to warmer destinations.
B007PT9870|4|I got this hat as a gift for my friend. I would have given this 5 stars, but when it came in, there was a big crease in the white padded area of the hat that wouldn't come out. When worn, it would fold in on itself.
B00IVDNKXC|3|It was super cute and seemed to be made well I had to return it due to it was smaller than advertised.
B00974AZDM|3|I purchased these for my husband.  I started with the lowest compression and he said his legs felt way better, but he would like to try a higher compression.  I then ordered the middle and highest compression.  These were difficult to get on, so I'm hoping he will like the middle compression.  It's trial and error with a product like this so it's nice to have so many options.  Thanks
B002LG6ENS|3|This matches the sweatpants I bought them together.  The only thing that could be better is sewn on patches instead of iron on's.<br />My husband seems to like the outfit.  I'm sure he will get plenty of wear out of them.
B007I7XUT6|5|My wife loves Jockey brand.  This particular apparel item was not stocked at the department store where she normally shops.
B00IAC0ML2|5|I love the colors and the cats, although I'd love the choice of dogs.  I'm hoping it will tickle the fancy of my young grandchildren when they visit.
B004TJMIFI|4|Will do the job!
B001B8CEOA|5|Very nice very comfortable, and most of all warm.  Well put together as well.
B008H89CNI|4|This sweatshirt was exactly what I expected from the Champion brand.  It was great looking and does exactly what I needed it to do and that was keep my snuggle bunny snuggly warm!
B000FH2Y34|3|I ordered the ipod holder and armband a few weeks ago.  I am still waiting for the armband to arrive in the mail.  It was suppose to be placed in the package with the ipod holder but was left out.  I have contacted the seller many times.  The first time the seller sent the armband to the wrong address, and now I am still waiting for another one to be sent to me.  This has been a very aggravating process and will not buy any other products from that buyer.  Thank you.
B00G6TMO6M|4|I got this for my daughter, who loves the Walking Dead.  I was impressed with how incredibly soft the robe was.  I think the sizing could be better because it was pretty large, but overall she liked it a lot.
B00P7W0PL0|5|Beautiful dress!!
B00BJNRQOK|5|I loved this hat, but had to return it because I couldn't get the right fit.  The company was AWESOME at working with me on the return process.
B0059ACUTA|5|Not being able to get my usual high waist jag jeans here in Australia any more I took a chance and bought these based on the good reviews and am not disappointed. I should have got a smaller size though as US sizing is different but as a dressmaker have been able to adjust to fit perfectly. Next time will get a smaller size. So comfortable and they are high rise which is preferable for the older woman. Highly recommend. Usual awesome service from Amazon, they are fantastic to deal with and goods delivered in Australia within a week!
B00JLTRX2E|3|Nice cozy socks. Unfortunately, the material has an awful smell. It took multiple Washington to get it to abate and even then you could still smell a mild odor. Often, items made in China  have this odor!
B00I0SVJUY|5|great quality, excellent features, a bit small for an xl. would recommend ordering a size larger than what you think you need.
B00BL9FZZO|1|I measured my son's head, and purchased the size according to what the Product Description details indicated. The hat was too small. If their sizing details are accurate, it should have been loose. I'm VERY unhappy that I did my homework, and on top of having to return the hat, have to pay the shipping to do so.<br /><br />Apart from that, the material used on the flap is cheap and stiff, not to mention short. It covered my five-year-old son's neck, maybe by half. Also, there were several long loose strings hanging from the brim of the hat in back.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed with the inconsistency with of the Product Description, or with the quality of the hat.
B00B777QY8|3|It's nice but it's not the color I thought it would be!!
B00FOSEUMW|4|I still recommend some foot powder in conjunction with this sock. It fits well, grips well, hides well, but it's a super thin barrier between you and your shoe and absorbs sweat just okay.
B0006U6D6Y|5|Great look and perfect fit. Arrived on time.  I will be buying more!  These are now my favorite pair of jeans.
B00KGRZK6Q|3|Works well but not made as well as others I have.
B0018OOYOK|3|Didn't realize they were button fly. They are a little loose and longer than desired
B0085WWABC|5|I love Domo. I also love this belt. Good quality. Quick shipping. It's why I never leave the house. ...Except to show off this belt
B00I5RPR58|4|Nice
B003WT157S|4|I love this sweater because it is so soft, lightweight, cozy and a beautiful red color. It's a go to sweater because it looks great with everything. The only reason I give only 4 stars is because it pills especially under the arms and elsewhere but less so. I have to shave it so it will look decent. I'm afraid one day there won't be anything to shave.  If you can get it on sale like I did it's still a nice buy.
B0053127NE|5|Pros: It is PRETTY. I got it in purple and the fabric feels soft to the touch, smoooth even. And the Pashmina is rich in its color. You will be impressed by the craftsmanship of this product and the person getting it will likely be impressed too. I actually bought the \\"Gift Packaged \\"Olive N Figs\\" Solid Plain Pashmina with a Complimentary Gift\\" from Nvie TWICE as gifts. Olive N Fig's Pashmina isn't nearly good of a quality as this item. If I could do it again, I would go with this item cause it looks so much better, looks like it would last longer, and the color is beautiful and the touch is very smooth and silky. Love love love this!!  Cons: There is a annoying, sticky sticker on there that says...something I forgot. But it is sticky and when you take it off, you have to be careful to not damage the Pashmina itself. Why do they do that?!? Packaging was also not impressive, it doesn't come with a gift box or anything, unlike the olive n figs, but I guess if they did that the price would be higher.
B005CSOS5I|4|Good quality and fit perfect.
B00730DBV0|5|My son loved it but all I say is a large is the size of an extra large. Other than that, the sweatshirt is a good buy!
B00M2ZMDJW|5|good
B009EREJ98|3|These are shorter and less warm than I expected. The colors are good. I would not buy them again.
B00PPCPB0W|5|The shirt fits him perfect just took a little long to get it.
B007D9KYEI|2|The quality of the gloves was poor and the item did not match the image. The shearling gloves are shown as leather; what I received was suede of poor quality. The shearling was also different than shown; I doubt it was genuine shearling. I returned them and received my refund.  Because of the quality of the gloves, I'm giving a 1-star rating; for their customer service I rate them 3 stars.
B00683RGKK|1|Way too big! I was hoping it was just slughtly bigger than the m/l...
B007RER5WI|5|These are my favorite PJs for my daughter.  They fit well, they are very soft before and after washing, the cuffs fit well over her ankles and wrists without tugging and fighting, and they seem to keep her very warm.
B00B4MC736|5|Can't say anything about it great quality as expected for quality band
B00AAGH6DI|5|Great belt and very affordable! Was looking everywhere, and was so happy to find it here. I love this website and it has great quality..cant wait to get more colors!!
B008LOSLJO|3|Noticed as soon as I opened it that it looked smaller and sure enough, when my husband tried it on was a bit snug but not enough so that he couldn't still wear it. just have to be sure and wash in cold water and not leave it long in dryer. Otherwise good quality for price.
B002JWF6OC|3|The Good: The wallet is fairly resilient. Most wallet sized items fit perfectly.    The Bad: The plastic clasp that holds the wallet closed isn't strong enough to hold near half of what they show in the infomercial. For $10 you would expect a piece of junk.. well for the most part thats what it is.    Comment: Originally I was worried about the wallet sliding out of my pocket due to the aluminum finish. I gave this wallet 3 stars because I am still able to use it by wrapping a thick rubber band around it. This keeps it closed and in my back pocket.. so \\"the bad\\" worked out after all.. Hope this review helps someone.
B00GKC9P7Q|3|I normally wear a size 8 in jeans and shorts (and own some size 9's in junior size) that fit perfectly so, with all the varying reviews on these being too big or being too small I thought I'd just take a chance and order a size 8. The length is just what I wanted but size-wise they are WAAAAAAAAAAAY too big (I knew before trying them on I could put them on OVER my regular shorts - and still have room.)<br /><br />I reordered a size 6 and they're still a bit loose around the waist, but if I wear them a bit lower than I like and tighten them as much as possible I should be okay. The size 6 fits the waist basically like most of my other board shorts. I don't know who the people are that are getting them and having them fit small, but that wasn't the case with me. Maybe there is just no quality control in the sizing department and it's hit or miss either way.
B00CEVCU8S|4|I like the long johns, so I tried the top. But you have to be careful of the description. &#34; performance&#34; are warmer than &#34; thermal&#34;.<br />No cotton in the performance version. But to my surprise equally as comfortable to wear at wotk. I though I was ordering the mate to the cotton/polyester pant. If your using an App or smart phone and you get &#34;mobileAmazon.com&#34; you dont get all the details about the materials used for the products. At least not on my phone.......
B0096KL9P0|2|Pros: soft to wear, very affordable for martial arts on a budget.<br /><br />Cons: picture makes it look white, it is the yellow non-bleached color (might be a pro for you, but want people to know), pants don't have any give, almost paper like feel, which makes me question longevity highly.<br /><br />Neutral: very thin gi, lightweight for summer, but if you are heavier or serious about grappling, this gi will rip before long.<br /><br />We get what we pay for, and its a nice cheap gi. Don't buy this expecting it to last a year grappling, but it could last fine for people just studying the art and not into any form of randori.
B001ELL6EI|4|I have worn this twice so far. It was scratchy putting it on at first, but not while wearing it. It fits well and is comfortable. It is supportive and does not allow much bounce. I did read several places that for sports bras you should order down a cup size and up a band size. I did this and it fits well. Overall at this point it is a good bra.
B00BXH3ZO2|5|i want to know which one to choose from since the size chart says one thing but i can only pick a # when its time to order
B003HIJ1YI|4|The shaper fit well and was comfortable.  The only disappointment was the  bottom part of  the leg was very thin and got a run in them the first day. I was hoping they would last a while longer.
B00VNRPPYA|1|Did not receive this dress. I got the bathing suit.
B001D6ATQ0|4|Pants are fine, as described. There is a little bit of fading after a few washes, but nothing terrible. I recommend them for someone needing some work pants, other than that, they're not the most attractive pants in the world.
B00283SP1S|5|Arrived in good time, but like someone else said it's delicate and the wooden bits shred easy. It has a zipper on top which is really cool; I'm not sure if I just completely overlooked that in the description or what. It's about the size of a small purse so you can fit what you need into it. Furthermore it's what I wanted and goes well with my little red riding costume.
B00HNMIJZ6|5|muy hermosos el color es especial y muy buen precio
B00CHGPJZG|5|Absolutely positively the most adorable outfit ever. Came on time folded and bright blue. Im definitely happy and will order more and the price was fantastic.
B00MN7CZ4C|2|I was looking for a nice down coat to keep me warm during the frigid winter months.  The down in this coat is nice, but the knit sleeves and sides do nothing to prevent cold.  I will keep the coat and probably donate it next year to Goodwill.  I definitely do not recommend the coat for colder climates, and if you need to layer it, I advise ordering a size larger than you normally wear, as you cannot get a heavy sweater/sweatshirt into those knit sleeves.
B002QREFJ2|2|It is stated to be 37.5 inches long but is actually 40 inches which is too long. Also, the leather end of the belt catches in the loop when removing it. By the way I have a blue belt by the same company which is 37.5 inches long. Both have small tags on them.
B00BS6QTO6|5|I love to shop for marked down deals at Amazon, and these pants were only $10! Great brand, great fit!
B00I3JK5GE|4|Shorts fit just like the size read.
B00CX7NERE|5|perfect. they fit as they should and were a hit at my Christmas party, now they are jammies and they make it feel like the holidays again
B00JET3UBO|5|I bought this for my husband for his birthday and he loves it.<br />Greater Apparel has unique T-Shirt designs for super affordable prices.<br />Their quality and fit are also really great. We have already washed the shirt multiple times and it doesn't shrink and it's still very soft.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase more items from Greater Apparel in the future.
B00R11Q4II|3|I think this is a super cute suit and it's the best knockoff, but it's WAY too small. I ordered a S and I'm 5'7 and 124 lbs, and it barely goes on me. I ordered a M instead, and I'm hoping this fits better. Otherwise, it's the cutest suit ever.
B00PH22PRW|3|The dress was very snug, length was okay though and it covers my 33week bump nicely. My main complaint is that it absolutely reeked of smoke when I took it out of the packaging.
B0018OTVKM|3|will they shrink ? I might need to return<br /><br />Ron
B00R7447Y2|1|Love it I am truly surprised. The diamond studs or pretty. Great quality. Gonna wear it next month on my bf birthday. I will update then. So its time to wear it... sigh. Had to tie the neck strap around my stomach<br />. I am 5&#34;6 and this is way too short... so disappointed
B000B8X16Q|5|Kids love them
B00DQ525AE|5|Seem perfect!  Have nto worn them as yet.
B00GXKN24C|5|great hat
B00E5Q6RNY|2|Yes I know I'm paying for the Star wars name.. I'm very disappointed that the first time I wore them paint chipped off of them.
B00HGAR6JU|5|This hat came MUCH earlier than expected, which is wonderful. I wore it the day after I got it and received multiple compliments. You can't go wrong with a cute, cheap beanie that shows off your sassy side.
B00NHUIIAY|5|Good quality.
B001GS3ARA|5|This is really great t-shirt. O.K. I'll like that there is Houses face somewhere on it, but I like it very, very much!!!
B0024L93R4|5|I had no expectations other than fast delivery and a decent robe.  As it turned out the robe was \\"top shelf\\" quality, made very well and something I can enjoy for several years to come.
B005CSOHRC|4|Nice lounge pant.
B00L4T1992|5|Wore it to Disney and got so many compliments!! Although I have a tiny waste it fit be just a tad bit big but that's where a cute belt comes in handy. Once again love it!!
B00GYO6D4S|5|My daughter needed a white shirt for a concert - this was great - neat styling - very cute on.
B0057X9NC6|5|I find these shirts to be of good quality and you really can't beat the price. . I don't smoke but I like having the pocket in them
B009NJWIMC|5|It's as nice as the lightweight robes in the hotels.  Received great, prompt service
B003P2VHSY|5|It is not often I can find a bra that is functional and nice  looking in my size 34g. The nursing bit is really a bonus. I continued to wear this bra when I wasn't nursing. Great support, very pretty. Price not bad at all.
B000ROC3YU|1|Mask I got has no resemblance to what I got. Cost more to return' so jus have to eat it..know better next time
B0039SBNK6|5|These are so lightweight, you hardly even know you have them on.  Love the fabric....the crotch I don't think is cotton, but it's just as nice because any dampness dries very quickly.<br /><br />I like 'em.<br /><br />Is an 80 year old woman too old to wear a thong type underpant?  I've been tempted....they look very comfy.
B008LWRCSC|5|Good fit, warm and much softer than regular duck jackets.
B00DEHAQZ0|5|I bought this as part of my Ms. Vader costume on halloween, but still wear it often. Great fit. Adorable tee.
B00JX3RMKQ|4|I like everything about this cardigan except that the color I ordered did not match the picture. Its still a great buy though!
B00DV35WU6|5|love it
B00MJVSTV0|3|Jacket appears much larger in design on the picture than it actually is, back part not as long as I expected.
B005CPSDX4|5|I gave this to my wife as a Christmas present. She wanted a robe that was shorter. She is already a short person about 5'2\\". I was worried that it would still seem long on her because she is so short. Anyway the robe came on time and she loved it.   It is very nice and is a quality made robe. It is not that thin cheap material. It is very soft and she wears it mostly after showers and in the morning if it's  a little chilly. She likes the hood that is on the robe she said that it comes in handy when she takes the dog outside. I would recommend this robe it is very nice if you are looking for a robe that is short. It is a knee length robe depending on your height it may be above the knee.   It is very soft comes with a belt and a hood and I think it comes in a variety of colors.
B00P4C1724|5|This Essential Plus Size Solid Oversize Asymm Dolman<br />Is that one top you wear in many different ways<br />IT  can be worn  a lone  .<br />Or with another top under it<br />like a tank top or a sort sleeve top '<br />The cowl neck you fold  down for a collar .<br />Or you can use it for a hood .<br />This top is waist length on front .<br />An longer in  the back  .<br />Which makes this top<br />that perfect one ,<br />for dress up or even be casual .<br />I would totally recommend this top<br />to any women who wears this size .<br />This is my honest opinion on this top .<br />I received this top as a promotion in return<br />for my honest review
B0039824GI|5|They are the perfect socks. Can't be kicked off. I have bought these type of socks for years to give as gifts and the feedback from new moms has always been possitive.
B00I30TWL2|3|The size was too small it's not a true xlarge it's more like a medium. If I could I would return it.
B000OTRDYI|1|I have owned and used many strapless bras, from expensive to &#34;cheapies&#34;.  This has got to be the worst fitting, most uncomfortable bra I have ever owned.  I don't like leaving bad reviews but I need to this time.  I know a lot of the other reviewers have had no problem with this bra but it rolled, bunched up and was extremely rough inside the cup of the bra.  I am returning it as we &#34;speak&#34;.  If you are full figured buy another product.  I am a 42 C and it did not even come close to fitting comfortably.
B002S19NCK|4|Reviewers from other sites who have bought dress like the quality BUT say the dress runs very small.  This may not be a problem with smaller framed ladies but size 12-14 say large was very tight and worried if the x-large would fit.
B00K5TB7FS|4|Nice quality and comfortable fit. Very satisfied!
B00KCR8JLS|5|I love these jeans. Levi's sizes are consistent across the board. This one in particular is my favorite pair they are slimming but easy to get into. They aren't jeggings I prefer a boot cut.
B00147FKFS|3|great
B00T5PRM3O|5|Love this shirt
B00492BA0E|5|These socks are really comfortable.  I wasn't initially certain if I'd like socks that came this far up the calf, but I have found I actually prefer them.
B000BT3YZS|1|Not the same as the TV one. The straps are not elastic and tear up your cash!
B000G0CH28|5|Great item and fits too.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to throw on something first thing in the morning.
B00FX6GIU2|1|This cover was in no way a 14/16
B003DKSXPS|5|My wife had me order these pants for a wedding; I'm more of a blue jeans kind of guy. Having said that, they are very comfortable and have a nice fit/feel, especially for hot/humid climates.<br /><br />I really like them even though they are outside my &#34;norm&#34;
B00BJTJAR0|4|This jacket is very nice, but in the picture you cannot see the white details, which change the whole look of the jacket. I was looking for something semi-dressy and so I was disappointed to see the large white sections that gave it a much more sporty look. Otherwise, a nice rain jacket
B008L1ZL8G|5|Nice feel to it even though not leather
B00FJ5LW6M|5|I have bought the cheap brands of these and they are broke with in days this one is tough mechanically sound and roomy enough for all my cash and card needs.
B00KFAQE96|1|The material is poor.  So is the tailor ship.  Totally not as shown in picture.  Do not buy this.
B00KT0ITG8|5|Incredibly soft and cozy.
B007Z0XDCK|5|Perfect size!
B00PZLA0PE|4|too long
B00GV2FU1K|5|These are nice but they are long.
B0054SO630|5|My husband loves the fit, style, and look of these pants. Perfect for work or casual wear. Can't say enough about them. They are cool and comfortable, as well as very functional. The pockets and loops make them very versatile. Would recommend to anyone.
B00LHTGNRM|1|bought 2 of these for a disney trip. before it was even used, one of the straps came loose. I sewed it back on and sewed over all of the others too to make sure. within a day or two of the trip, the zippers had fallen apart, the seams were coming apart, and the straps were unraveling. The only reason I'm even giving it one star is because I have to, otherwise it would get ZERO! Do not waste your money!!! I'm sending them back!<br /><br />this was the other bag we bought. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LHTGNJ0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2<br /><br />too bad because they're really cute!!!
B01146PE22|5|Absolutely gorgeous!  The fabric is silky and feels good too and very classy look.  I can't wait to put this on!
B00DZQT0N4|5|very comfortable
B006ID8AYQ|5|We got this coat for my daughter after looking at nearly every other coat that exists, it seemed! She's picky like you wouldn't believe :) she wanted a coat that was a 3in1 because she gets hot a lot and wanted the flexibility that it offered.  She wanted a coat that wasn't really puffy...it had to have a fairly slim silhouette. She wanted it to be blue..but not just any blue! She was picky about the material, the pockets, the hood, etc! Anyway, this coat fit all of her requirements and mine (durable, warm, not ridiculously expensive). Overall, it's been a great value so far that I hope to make last at least another year...Until she outgrows it :) the only downside is that it gets dirty and the light color shows the dirt a ton.  but then again, it is a light colored coat on a seven year old, so what can we expect? Very happy with the purchase!
B00LGVFJJO|3|Looks great, keeps you warm, zipper is a complete dud.  You REALLY have to struggle with the zipper on this thing.
B003R6VUCG|4|Perfect for this in between weather when it's windy but not too cold outside. Fits my Women's size perfect. It is boxy but that's what I want. Nice color choices too.Good price and quick delivery.
B002ZIZN20|5|This shirt sells for much less than the other alternatives here on Amazon, but it's a great deal.  Shirt is amazingly comfortable, looks great, and made of sturdy material.  As far as durability, I can't say yet, but as a new shirt, it's really terrific.
B000EXRSYO|5|Just as with the other t-shirts I ordered from this merchant, this shirt is true to size, well-made and beautiful.  The screen print is high quality and for the price, I can afford to wear it as a work shirt at the barn and with its nice looks, I can also wear it out casually.  Excellent item!
B0085U34LY|5|Will be ordering more. I've been looking for this for quite awhile.So glad I found it. I'll see after laundering
B00KHLGH6S|5|This cotton T is thin and soft (like a combed cotton feel), with euro-style thin ribbed collar that is reinforced with cotton tape in the back, which spans the entire shoulder seam.  Sleeve and waist openings are double stitched hems (inner and outer).  These shirts are on the dressier end of the spectrum.  They can definitely be worn confidently underneath any high-necked dresswear, as they are of a fabric and design that they can pretty much be worn alone.  The Amazon price is a super value - this is not a shirt you'll want to surrender to the rag-bin any time soon.
B0041OJ4NK|1|I should wear a D by the size chart and the C is too big.
B00OPEB236|5|Love it
B00LTTLMM6|4|I'd like to say that you should definitely measure yourself out before you purchase these. With all slim fits it's important you get the size exactly right.<br /><br />With that being said, the shirts fit great, they come as expected, fit as expected, and have a great look to them.<br /><br />Things to mention:<br />1) They require cuff links<br /><br />Con:<br />1) The bottom of the shirt (on the sides) are curved, so if you wear your shirt tucked in all day; you might find yourself exposing your undershirt and have to re-tuck in your shirt.
B00JXFTVAS|5|he loved it!
B002OWVWTK|2|if you're going to shell out some decent $$ for a hat you might actually wear somewhere besides a stage play or Halloween, this hat was a disappointment.  to the good:  it arrived quickly and came out of the box in good condition.  the silk inside the hat is nice and the wool exterior nice as well.  to the bad:  the construction, particularly of the rim, was pretty warped, at least on the one i received.  without exaggerating too much, kind of like a 5th grader cut out the pattern.  i'm sending it back for this reason and will try another vender.
B00MWWTFJQ|4|Very cute
B00F2FTH0W|5|Very nicely made, sturdy and nice design.
B005IR09VA|4|Good quality.  Lights work well. Will be a good costume. Good color and fit. Glad it in came with the free shipping.
B0077RT4P6|5|If you're a person who can rock this shirt with confidence, it'll be worth it. It's hilariously ridiculous if you can pull it off, and you'll definitely have random people smiling at it. I gave it away to a white elephant thing, and it was well-received.
B00JXMCGHQ|5|Very nice material and comfortable enough to keep warm in and lounge in
B008KKSJ5A|5|I was concerned about the size because it was listed funny. But they fit my son perfect and keep him warm. I really like these.
B00KCFRG0A|3|Although its a great blouse, it came out smaller than the size it says it is. And the fabric seems a bit cheap. But overall I guess I can tone upand slim down to wear it :)
B003KTM952|5|These jeans look great and are very comfortable.  They do run small though.  Red Engine told me a size 29 equates to a size 8, but I had to get a size 30, perhaps because these are slim, skinny jeans.  The length is perfect for me, whose height has always been in my legs, but I could see these being too long for most people.  Should be easy enough for a tailor to hem
B00C0VIVUI|5|Exactly what my wife wanted!
B000GKJN5M|5|I love this bra! Having a large chest is a bittersweet blessing. Wires hurt. This is so soft, great padding. Stays in place. I'm a 38 D. Even my sports bras bug me if on for more than a few hours. I just bought two more of these and cannot wait to have them. Perfect for a music festival for comfort and style.
B0089SX6RY|5|Looks great. LIKE<br />Runs a bit small, but knew by reviews.
B0037ZB9VO|5|I love the material, the fitting... I just love this product! I'm thinking maybe I should order one in every color!!!
B00S6LGUWC|5|I ordered this dress for a Valentine dance & it arrived much sooner than expected & the size was a great fit. I received a lot of compliments on this dress! I just loved everything about this dress, you must order the petticoat in order to get the full effect of the flare bottom....I plan to order another dress from this company....Thanks!!!
B000HTEKQE|4|Very good product. Arrived promptly. Fit very well. Completely satisfied. Would order again.
B0066BZ00C|5|The price is really good and those gloves are really warm and beautiful I love my gloves and I want buy another color.
B00HQYKYCC|3|I returned this because it was too large, and the material too loud and crinkly sounding.  I wanted lightweight, but was hoping for something a bit more sophisticated than this.
B00PHT050E|5|perfect and beautiful
B00GJCY61C|3|the waist band is very tight. Wish it had a drawstring.
B00OKMWD2W|5|Great sellet no problems. Everyone loves the shirt
B00QME8U28|5|Love it.
B000VZ9WT4|2|This is only good for short time as it tears and doesn't fit properly.  Disappointed and the young man wanted to be able toplay with after Halloween and he cannot as it does not stand up.
B00DC9M9H8|5|I want to give this a billion stars. This is the BEST BRA EVER for a small chest. It's so soft and comfortable. The padding/lining is just enough and shapes to breast perfectly. I have broad shoulders and wide set breasts, and the width and shape of this bra are perfect. Regular bras don't work for me because when I buy a wide enough cup, it's always too deep. Because this bra has no cup, the super soft stretchy fabric molds perfectly. I'm getting one in every color. The first one I tried is pebble - color is more light maroon/dusty rose.
B00XUTTS0Q|5|Really liked my shirt, fit perfect and everyone kept asking where I bought it!!
B004XGU84K|5|This jacket has a lot going for it. I have the black and it is fine for dressy casual..<br /><br />Fit is great! I'm a perfect Medium and this jacket is true to size. Fits perfectly.<br /><br />Shell is a medium weight SOFT denim. Inside lining is the old style Levi faux fur (blk in the blk jacket). Very nice. Sleeves are lined with a smooth synthetic. Easy to slip your arms in.<br /><br />Just minutes after putting it on I was feeling warmer. Should be a great jacket for the coolest days here in SE Texas. There is enough room to wear a medium weight sweater if needed.<br /><br />Inside one extra pocket on left side large enough for a wallet, pack of cigarettes etc. No closure for this pocket.<br /><br />Zipper and button closure. Great option. The zipper is light duty and appears to be only average quality. The zipper is brass painted black. I'll probably be using the buttons most often anyway.<br /><br />For those interested: the sleeves or waist don't seal well for cold cold weather.<br /><br />True the description is incorrect: should be outershell 100% cotton. Machine wash, line dry. Cool iron if needed.<br /><br />Amazon put these on sale again, so I can buy the brown one next. :)<br /><br />Made in China :(
B004GP845S|5|Needed some tailoring for the pants but was a very decent quality for the price and I WAS impressed.  Fit was of the coat was also right on and yep, very good quality, THANKS!
B00CE91FEK|5|Really detailed .. Very unique looking and perfect for the Star Wars loved of any age or any gender .. Awesome
B00D83Q262|5|Perfect.
B00GWJLFKC|5|Fantastic packaging job. Arrived as described. Fast shipping. Exactly the gift for which I've been looking!
B00I9TCIQS|5|This is such a pretty dress, I bought an 18 and it fits very well. I'm a 38DD and it shows in this dress, I don't think you will want to pin the material because it is thin and I'm afraid it will rip the garment so if you would like to wear to work, buy a came. I bought the Yellow/Gold one. The color is very attractive and I'm not the tannest person. I bought some yellow eyeliner at 599fasion that goes WONDERFULLY with the dress and makes my eyes POP.
B00382E71U|5|These multipacks are lifesavers for us with twin boys going through potty training. They love the characters and use them as inspiration to use the &#34;big boy potty&#34; so they don't mess up Thomas or any of his friends.
B00CFICSXM|2|I wear a size 25 is all Miss Me jeans but these were huge on me! I would recommend going a size down.
B00LMF3PXG|4|Unlike other NYDJ jeans I own, these run true to size. I usually have to buy a size smaller which is what I did this time and they are a little tight.  I am keeping them, but if they shrink when washed, i,will need to return. Otherwise, a great looking pair of pants
B00HRBWAK8|1|Was not a 'newsboy' hat as the picture showed. Was just a crochet beanie
B00ABUYTHE|4|It seems like an okay cap. I ordered the 3-6 month size for my above average size 3 month old and it is way too big. Maybe by 6 months it will fit better. Be aware that &#34;lavender&#34; color is more gray than it is purple.
B00DCTIHRE|5|This jacket is beautiful! I did not know what to expect because it is faux leather, but the jacket is actually one of the nicer jackets I have seen so far. It fits true to size and I really like the way you can use the zipper to style the front differently. I have purchased other BlankNYC items and I really like the quality of the products. I recommend adding this piece to your wardrobe!
B005GR10CO|3|The underwear fit well and are well constructed but I now remember why I quit wearing Hanes. I have a bruised feeling spot on my hip from the seam. Their seams are just too bulky. Otherwise they are reasonable price and the colors were bad. Mine are white to gray to blue spectrum b
B00ACIHFTE|5|Ordered the XL pair after seeing that they ran small. I'm a size 40 waist and these fit snugly. If anything, they were almost on the verge of being too big. Colors are nice and the boxers are super soft and comfy.
B00Q2HQ0RM|5|Beautiful shirt, just as shown in the picture, very well made, great material, fresh.  It runs a little big, but it still fits perfectly
B001SJNTH8|5|These are outstanding.  they are extremely soft and comfortable and fit very well.  Strange that the company only makes underwear, as I would probably buy anything they made. I'm particular about underwear and I was skeptical about buying online, but again, I love the fit of these. Will definitely purchase these again.  I have found my new brand.  Thanks Uranus!!
B008P5K8E0|5|These gloves are adorable, fashionable, and so classy! I love them!
B000PWIZZ0|5|This is my new favorite satchel.  Because it's depth is shallow, I could see where everything is and pull out objects right away. It has pockets to keep my cellphone and keys separated. It's surprisingly roomy because of it's east-west width.  I could carry a full size hair brush, a wallet, my cigs, lighter, my keys and two checkbooks with room to spare.  It is definitely not one of those black-hole handbags in which you had to search 5 minutes for a pen.
B00E7OM4V8|5|My daughter (age 15) likes the style and color.  She wore a pair on an outing on a cold day and claimed they were much warmer than she expected.  We choose acrylic socks because they are soft, warm and durable.  The value was also good.
B004JU0F2U|5|Babies wearing ComfortLuxe fabric remain cooler when it's warm and warmer when it's cool, for healthier skin and more comfortable sleep. The new fabric also helps to keep baby's temperature regulated and prevent overheating, which is a known SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) risk.<br /><br />The HALO ComfortLuxe is perfect for babies during the summer time, keeping them cool over the summer and as parents we know that they wont overheat.
B005GVTNRY|3|I needed plain white tops and thought this would be good for summer. It's OK but nothing special. I was disappointed with the material. I know from past experience too that this will shrink in the dryer so I will need to let it drip dry, not a convenience.
B00N2LACZC|5|It's lovely
B00EIQY7M4|2|Terrible fit. Tight in upper body and neck, loose in stomach area. Text graphics is off centered. Don't waste your money.
B00MK2DW56|2|These looked great until I put them on. The garter belt fit perfectly if I pulled it up where it sat over my hips. However, the straps are sewed to the stockings and the straps are a bit long so the stockings sit lower and slide down lower than I'd like them. May look better if I was taller than 5'3. The stockings are also very thin. I don't have long nails, but when I got them on for the first time I  already had a run in the back. Not sure if that was already there or not.
B00AMB03J0|5|This was a gift for my new grand daughter. It was much prettier and frilly than in the picture.<br />My daughter loved it.
B00RFAFXEG|4|Love the shorts.  They fit as expected and the quality is what you would expect from Levi.  I took off 1 star though because regardless of the amount of spray and wash I used it stained really easily.  I know, white shorts, right?
B005GPTS66|5|I love this pants cause they are longer than usual.
B00KV63KVO|5|I love it. It fits well
B00IJ80CA8|1|Not what I expected you can see threw it every poor quality
B00R5AY5PE|1|Didn't fit and I have contacted seller 3x to try and return them. Still have them and no refund. Apparently these run small.
B00474DQQ0|2|I was very disappointed with this hat, I don't think it looks anything like the hat in the ad.  I am giving it as a Christmas gift and I am very anxious about how it will be received.  I would not recommend this item .
B00WE4FZ1O|5|it fits for my 4 yr old son.
B0081O9RNS|5|I like the fit...it seems every  style fits differently, but this one is the best for me...
B006TK3JK8|1|This looks like a beautiful bubble gum pink. I thought it would go perfectly with the new suit I bought my daughter. It is an UGLY dark coral/orangey/red color. NOT LIKE THE PICTURE AT ALL!!!
B00IN6PU9Y|4|First day wearing this cincher. I liked the fact that it's longer so it covers most problem areas, however, I wish it was longer in the back!!!! I have that lower back fat and I keep having to pull it down to cover that area every time I sit. It does move ever so slightly but it is a major compression! I am 5'7 180 lbs, I ordered an XL and had to stretch it out a bit to fit in it. It's tight but I can breathe and function just fine! Sweating my gut off in it, but I love the fact that the inside is lined with cotton, otherwise it would move all over like a sweatband does. I do love this cincher so far, just wish it had an extra 2 inches in the back! But unfortunately you won't find that because I couldnt! This was the longest I came across with bonding for support! Didn't want this thing rolling up on me, and it doesn't! Great buy!
B006LPHJ7U|5|this is a durable money clip with a strong clip so your money isn't falling out everywhere.  I like this one because you can show your id without having to fumble with taking it out of a slot.  well made
B00M1MPF7S|5|Love the dress and color. Fit very nice!! Can not wait to show off in it.  💛
B00ACIGNJW|5|I am pleased with this product, the color assortment is nice, after many washings the fit is still good.
B00MS4WG0S|5|Loved it
B0053EWMF4|5|I am very happy with the purchase of this item for my daughter's dance class.  She is quite small, so I was worried that the size would not fit, but it does fit perfectly with a little room for her to grow.  The skirt is great as well!  Not too short, but not too long to get in the way of things.
B00K5AKI02|5|I am very picky and enjoy high end articles. I rarely write reviews due to the fact that I am always quite busy. I am taking the time to write one for this fabulous item. The back story is that I have had a similar one a long time ago and it was wearing out so I stopped using it and went to a huge wallet that could accommodate all of my credit cards and essentials.  I had hoped to find the identical one to my old billfold again because I liked it so much. When I found this one it looked much like my old one but there were significant advantages in this one. From earlier reviews it appeared that several cards could be placed in the bilfold. That is important, as I carry about 12 at all times. This one easily holds 12 cards. I could not hold that many in my old one. I took a high resolution photo taking a great deal of care to capture the correct color. The photo online looks more orange than it does in person. The quality seems like it will last quite some time. I really like the fact that the red and tan colored ribbons pull the cards out of their pockets. That is a HUGE plus over the one I had. I have to agree with an earlier comment that just a couple of cards may seem a bit loose. This is for the folks that have several credit cards, a licence and some business cards to carry. I am finally free of my George Costanza wallet.  Even with all of those cards, this is comfortable to have in my front pocket. I also loaded, just to see if it would fit, over 40 bills in it - yes it fit. That also would not have fit my old one.<br /><br />Update: March 2016. I forgot and left my wallet in my jeans when they went in the laundry. Washer and dryer! I immediately ordered another only to find that the wallet was in PERFECT condition. Holy mackerel. This thing is indestructible. Now I have two great wallets. I gave one to my father. Highly recommend.
B00GXNNLOK|3|I was generally pleased with the look and sizing of this shirt.  I would have given it more stars except it has very picky laundry instructions--wash in cold water on delicate cycle and hang to dry.  I don't expect such delicacy in a t-shirt!
B009E8MOM6|4|My daughter asked for these for her birthday. They are a little larger than expected but she usually wears a slim and these were only available in regular sizes. The color and length were really good. The details on the back pockets were kind of cheap and I wonder how they will withstand to washing but perhaps if I turn them inside out they will last longer.
B0089Q8U7W|2|Not too happy with this purchase. The fabric is very cheap and they do not fit right. Very loose around the foot, but too tight around the thigh. The only reason I didn't return these is because I need them for my Halloween costume and it would be a hassle to try to find more stockings like these.
B000HAMIQW|5|Fit perfectly and was loose fitting. Worked great for our costume.
B00YB4VHH6|5|Everything was perfect!!!!
B00CNKPKDW|5|Grandson loves his jammies!
B003BL5442|5|I was looking all around in stores for dark brown wig caps and was not lucky so I was very grateful to find these online. Thanks!
B00QPZ75S4|2|Cute design but looks and fits like a tarp!
B00BPDGH2G|5|Christmas gift for Granddaughter, she loved it.  Arrived ahead of time, very pleased.
B000MWXBNO|5|They fit and are as comfortable as a bar can be
B005VA6BBG|5|The material is very soft and warm - makes the robe really cozy.  Shipping was fast.  My wife is almost 6 feet tall and a little more length would have been great, but overall the fit is just fine.  Overall this bathrobe is excellent.
B008VF3W38|2|Actually, the hat itself was made very well for a generic brand.  I was real excited to receive this hat and was extremely anxious with anticipation of owning this hat.  One thing that I wished the company selling this hat would have included in their description is that the hat is for a 12 year old.  It is way too small on my head and I have a big head that is why I buy snapbacks. The crown was way too low.  Needless to say I was very disappointed. Now I have to pay for return shipping.  Oh, well I gambled ordering on line without trying it on.  This is probably my last blind buy for a hat.  Guess I have to stick to the mall
B000G77OWE|5|Best heavy work shirts I have ever found.
B00183YGWQ|4|They are VERY cute, I ordered the black ones.  The stitching is a little different, they are the most comfortable \\"heeled\\" boots that I own.  Be warned... They are more like 6 -7 inches!!
B000SV1PD2|5|He just loves rubbers... Never wants to take them off when he comes inside. Even wanted to go to bed in them!
B00CSIXFSQ|1|Was a cheap piece of fabric. Hate it. Not worth your money. Was very disappointed when I got it.
B00TLN1K5G|5|Love it
B003NX8C7E|5|I like this jacket very much. It fits well and is warm. I may purchase another one in a different color.
B006BBNRFW|5|I was not expecting it to be this good of quality fabric! I am very happy with the product and I am sure my child will be able to grow with this robe.... A great buy and shipped out very quickly thanks!!!
B00CX0LGMG|4|I love Levi's.  My son has been wearing uniform pants for elementary, but now he is in junior high I wanted to get him some quality jeans without breaking the bank.  These work great.
B00LXGU226|5|For reference, I am 5'6&#34; and 140lbs.  I have a small waist and larger hips/butt and legs (athletic build) and I ordered a size 7.  These jeans fit me well.  The thigh is snug but not excessively and although the waist is slightly loose on me (something I've come to expect for my shape), they do not gape in the back like some other jeans do.  The rise is slightly low on me, so I wear a belt to keep my crack from showing when I bend down.  These jeans have just the right amount of stretch--enough to conform to my shape without stretching out and getting loose after a few hours of wear.  The length is perfect for heels, but a little long for flats (I just cuff them up once when I wear flats, which I think looks cute anyway). The size and placement of the pockets accentuates my rear-end in a good way.  I may be 30 with 3 kids, but I don't want to wear &#34;mom jeans&#34; and these definitely aren't!  For me, these fit my shape better than Miss Me jeans, and for a better price.  Love them and will be buying more!
B00AAVXF92|4|Great quality hoodie. However, size 3xl was more like a 2xl. Order one  size up from your normal.
B00G5IT4H6|5|These are awesome! I wear them all the time and have gotten so many compliments on them. Comfortable, good fitting, durable material. Definitely worth it.
B00QYB3PQA|5|It's nice good job Amazon
B0019CWRSQ|1|They were a bit too small, guess I will have to make them work.
B008R6TOA6|5|I rec'd these in a very timely manner with the correct size and colors, I wish everything would be that simple and YES it has multi-colors. Good Choice on this item.
B007Y4H4PO|5|Love the fabric, it's very soft and the garment hangs very comfortably.  Love it for those lazy evenings watching TV.  The snaps on the sides can be a little uncomfortable for sleeping.
B000WVEA7G|5|Purchased this wallet for my mother in Bordo (dark red) to replace her old, Old, OLD parachute wallet she has used for years (10+). She is just getting acclimated to buying online and was skeptical of product quality so I searched and found this wallet for her. When it came in the mail she loved it!<br /><br />Just to compare... I purchased a similar wallet for business cards over 10 years ago for @$20 and this is made just as well. The only thing that will age this wallet is excessive friction or letting it dry out. Like all fine leather goods the patina gets better with time.<br /><br />NOTE: When the wallet arrives in the mail put some leather conditioner or shoe balm on it (non-color). Balm or conditioner will restore oils to the leather and help it weather the incidents of life like friction and accidental wetting from water and other spills. Let the conditioner soak in for 5 minutes then get a shoe brush or soft clean cloth and buff it.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00EEJFC9W|5|Awesome, fit Awesome Price..thank God I can wear a 31... because 32&#34; is $39.99.. Ouch...I only paid $ 14.99.. for sizes 30&#34; and 31&#34;.. Yay  Amazon !!
B00AS2YK42|4|I rated it a four. This is for my daughter as a gift, I will let her be the judge on this. I like it very much and she probably will too. She loves Shangri-La Nook bags.
B007KFZGFW|5|The best bra I ever had for working out. I have a huge bust and most bras do not support me during my workout. This bra does!!! Love it, love the price!!
B00A76E64I|4|works well
B00CQMYIQM|5|Perfect!
B00LBOGVG6|2|this is completely see through
B00B9CLRAA|5|Fit as expected
B0030LPT20|5|Surprisingly nice quality, super fast shipping. Will probably return to this seller for patches again. Was one frayed corner on the top left but it wasn't anything that was bad enough to unravel or shorten the life of the patch at all.
B00J2LB82M|1|Not at all what I expected!
B00R5FK6Z2|5|Perfect
B007T4ANEI|5|All good
B00BUKIVF0|5|nice and beatiful
B001BG4ZCQ|3|not as well made as I had hoped.
B007B7G9AK|5|I've now ordered three pair of these and they are my favorite dress pants.  They fit really well, look great, and the colors and seams hold up well to lots of laundering and the manual labor I get suckered into every few weeks.  I bought these to replace some pants i purchased from JC Penny, and Macy's that had the seams... lets call it 'give up' during some of manual labor I do.  Great pants, definitely worth a shot if you are looking for some dress slacks
B004WSPZLU|5|I wanted something that did not hurt my tummy as it has been sensitive to pressure. I surprised that it was made with more areas to hold in place on tush then others. Delicate, very light weight fabric.
B00FB34VAG|5|Score! Preparing for our Annual boundary waters  trip this summer, I needed to replace our old, rusted, eating utensils.... Yes we have been doing this for so long it's time to update the gear!<br /><br />I originally purchased this item with another hobo type tool for eating. One for the hubby, and one for myself. I didn't want to order two identical items ( because I wasn't sure this item or the other would be better).<br /><br />The item I ordered for myself, is so tiny, ( spoon size and fork Size) I decided to give it to my 4 year old son! ( that should tell you something!). However, this item is perfect! Amazing size to do shore lunch with fresh fish, and to spoon up a full load with some MREs or Mountain house, incase your catch didn't come through.<br /><br />Would recommend for the avid backpacker, hunter, camper Ect.<br /><br />Only CON  with this item, is that I just got another utensil EaTin' n tool... And that is officially way cooler than this anyday!  Hahahah
B006TAEBFK|4|Fit well and very light weight. The sleeves could be a bit longer but overall nice rash guard.
B001RNO2QM|4|The color is a slightly paler yellow than pictured but still looks pretty cool. Very comfortable, also. A nice addition to my Beasties t-shirt collection. I'll miss your tunes, MCA! Been listening to you since '87.
B004G0ACDA|5|Very sweet pattern.  Is soft and wears well.
B006Z8I3R8|5|Good shirt for the money
B004OI7L1A|2|Although this is marketed as a &#34;comfort&#34; bra, it was anything but. The straps are not adjustable, and are very short. I wanted a compression sports bra, but this one was just too small for my A-B frame.
B00C6UT9AE|4|I wore it with a pair of skinny jeans because it was TOO short on me to go out without something on my legs.  But It fit my figure nicely. I'm a size 12-14 (Hour glass shape).  I didn't un-zip, just threw it over my head and pulled.  It stretched in the areas it needed to- It looked pretty hot on me. ;)  I followed the sizing chart, i think i wound up ordering the large.  I recommend it for fun festival &/ or Disney Princess costume use.
B00BXOP0X4|3|Nice and bright with reflective strips makes this the perfect hat for my crossing guard duties.  The hat came already curved at the bill, and something about the way its put together makes it very uncomfortable on my forehead.  I'm only on duty for 35 minutes each shift and I end my shift with a headache.  Making an adjustment to the velcro strap in the back didn't help.  I only spent $8 on the hat, so it wasn't worth the hassle in sending it back for another.
B00LWE8MNK|5|I love these shorts. They even look good on a 56 year old overweight guy.
B00J4C153G|5|I bought this shirt for my husband and despite some of the reviews, it was a perfect fit for the size he usually wears.  He loves the shirt - very cool and comfortable!
B003WQR7TQ|4|looks just like the pic ..... sturdy....material a little rough before a wash w/fabric softener and seems to look a little on the small side for 12 mos, especially if it shrinks.  my great nephew is just under 3 mos and it looks like he'll be wearing it soon! ORDER SIZE 24 mos for a full fledged 1 yr old unless they are at or under 28 lbs!!!!!
B005T8V0QQ|5|I lost a lot of weight and invested in a bunch of \\"girly\\" dresses. But hey, I'm middle-aged and have the loose skin from a huge weight loss, which means that sleek dresses need shapewear.<br /><br />I decided to try this cause I'm a 38DDD and slips with built in bras run too small for me.<br /><br />Well, this worked great. I'm a size 14 in dresses (some 12, some designers 16, depends), and I got the XXL and it was great Not too tight, snug enough to stay put and sleek me down a bit. Comfortably, except I did have to pull the hem down a few times. For those who need a size guide, my measurements are 45-35-45, and the XXL was tight enough, not too tight. Not super compressed, which is uncomfortable. I hate feeling OVERLY compressed. In fact, it was compressive enough in waist hips, and actually slightly loose up in the band area (this has no cups). Which is fine..cause I wear a bra with it, right? :D<br /><br />I came on to get it in 'skin\\" tone (I got the black)...and it's not available. Really bothers me taht I found something that works and is affordable (ie, not Spanx crazy prices), and it's NOT AVAILABLE. Come on, Amazon. Stock up on the XL and XXL sizes for us!!!!<br /><br />I'd definitely rebuy.
B003I7EAH6|4|These are beautiful and the material is sheerly comfortable.  The only thing i would have liked was a little more bottom coverage.  They tend to work their way to the center.  Maybe if a size larger was ordered they might be better.
B00I8FY1UY|5|Excellent.
B007UQLO7A|4|I have arthritis and this front close bra gives as much support as back close models. Very comfy. True to size.
B00OCBWJ6Q|5|This is a great product. Shipper in a timely manner and was as promised! 10/10 would shop again.
B00KSO48A6|5|Perfect sizing, affordable price, and it's great to actually find a sweater dress for my daughter!  She loves sweater dresses but I looked all over for a nice one (last year I got a good one at Old Navy----this year they had none).  Of course, be sure to also buy tights.
B00LI7MVH4|1|I bought these so that I could go skiing with the family. The pants fit was as expected.  I'm normally a size 10 but bought a large to have plenty of room.  They kept me warm and dry (with a layer of Under Armor) in 17 degree with light wind.  The next time I wore them was hiking with the family in an open, wide path.  When we got back I realized that the pant had completely split open.  Not along the seam as expected my horizontally, through the seam!  I was shocked!  There is no way I had got caught on anything, due to how wide the path was.  Plus, the pants were somewhat large and I had plenty of room in them, so I don't think it was a fit issue. I would not recommend due to how easily they ripped.  I basically got one wear out of them.
B009W5VR6U|5|This hat is the way you see it. It is grey, not blue. It is a great design. I bought one for my daughter and she loved it, so I got one for myself. I don't look good in hats,but this one looks good on everyone.
B0050G1MFG|5|They move well and last a long time.  Will certainly buy more in the future.  Good for an everyday pant or work pant.
B00KG4VJ64|2|The size is too small, so if you are size L ask for XL. Should be a chineese size or something and they must tell costumers about that!!
B00IYX6GEE|5|I received my pins and very satisfied with quality,price and service. Thanks!
B003KW1HW0|3|I bought my 9-year-old this costume for Halloween in 2012.  I glued a wide strap of leftover fuzzy brown material from last year using Quick Stitch glue to the strapless side (but you could also just have her wear a tank top underneath.  She also wore black stretch pants with it.  I wouldn't recommend it for adults because it really is so short and small, but for us the price was right (11) and it made a perfect costume with my minor adjustments.<br /><br />The skirt did start falling apart at the seams after Halloween, but I don't think it was meant to last and you could always glue/stitch it back together if necessary.
B008V9GQR8|3|Even with a shirt tucked in the waist is too large for the size label. And larger too compared with a regular pair of straight leg Lee jeans received on the same order - which fit fine. Perhaps they were sized for baggy people.
B00K8E6XFY|5|A perfect combo.  Great material.  It's slightly smaller than I thought but definitely great for those that do not carry a lot of makeup around.
B0012XZ78E|5|Very comfortable
B0013KSBAM|5|This item is pretty much exactly what I wanted, and does appear to be exactly as advertised. It could certainly be made a little stronger, the nylon feels thin, like 300-500 denier, I'd like to see 700-1000 but time will tell. The corners are heat sealed, I'd rather see them folded and taped. This item is single stitched, and I'd rather it be double stitched. For $10 plus $5 shipping, I expected that level of quality. This item will be in my pocket however, not on my belt, so perhaps this will suffice. I can see myself needing to replace this item in the future due to wear and tear, and while I'd rather buy one that would last forever, I've looked pretty extensively for this particular item, and I don't think there is anything better that will suit my purposes.  All in all, I'm satisfied.
B00RK1S2NO|1|zero feeling like with the picture... or I got mailed the wrong thing.<br />extreme soft and thin material, no shape look and size just tiny.<br />the measure is in inches
B00GXA4VI8|5|Initially purchased for wear during workouts and exercise.  Proves so comfortable sweatshirt is now worn around the house.  As an aside comment the shirt was worn to a supermarket where it was spotted by a Navy aviator.  In a very congenial conversation with much backslapping and handshaking he kindly took time to remind me Navy had won the recent Army/Navy football game.  There are obviously many benefits to this sweatshirt...
B00PDBMN74|5|Best jeans i ever had!:)
B00WDZ8J8K|5|Let me start off by saying that I am 150 lbs and 5'5. I ordered a L just to be on the safe side. I am in LOVE with this waist trainer. When I first got the waist trainer and held it up in front of me I was like OMG I should have gotten an XL. After I got home I tried on the waist trainer. It felt really good but just be mindful it is rather tight but not an uncomfortable tight. The first day wearing my waist  trainer I wore it while I worked out. My workout consisting of me walking across the dam which is about 6 miles. I must say exercising with this was very comfortable and it help me keep a good posture while walking. By the third day I was able to adjust my waist trainer to the second row which is rather great in so short time. Today I am wearing the waist trainer at work. I sit at my desk for the majority of my day and the waist trainer does not bother me at all sometimes I forget that it is on. I wear the waist trainer at least 6-7 hours a day (even when I eat breakfast, lunch or dinner). Hopefully by the end of next month I will be able to adjust the waist trainer on the last row. This may sound far fetched but I am already starting to feel and see the difference. I am one happy customer. Just an FYI the size chart for this is a little off so if you usually wear a M I would get a L. Other than that this waist trainer is amazing!!!
B001SN7PQK|5|I bought an XX large, I normal wear an X-large. It will shrink and be no good if you don't order it BIG.
B003Y5IB4A|4|Fits. Really well! Its a great shaper and fits nicely with some snug. Stays up no rolling down so far. Ill update the review later.
B008W1AD7O|5|Super comfy
B00L674D7W|5|Just as expected!! Size, color, quality ...all good
B004UBHWHE|4|Based on their sizing chart I ordered a Large, only to discover I needed the Xlarge. I was slightly irritated but the seller made the exchange really easy and really fast. They're good swim trunks for $20, the tag on them says $118. That's probably what they origionally were at some department store. DEFF not worth that much!
B004XFGK20|4|Quite amazing jacket, beautiful white color. I rated it four satrs though, cause I needed it for workouts, and it is too fitted. I also bought the Benton model, and its much more comfortable.<br />If what you want is a fitted lightweight jacket go for it but remember to order a size down. I'm a medium and ordered a small and fits perfectly.
B00DAYGWR8|4|my grand daughter loves hello kitty and I went by the age recommendation of 2-6X, but the backpack is quite large for a 3 yr old. She still likes it though.
B005ZKUT3S|5|Bought this for a med/large friend.It fits him as a big thick winter robe. It doesn't have the fuzzy shedding problem that some robes have. I might buy another one for my dad.
B00PC5MMU4|3|It's okay, I kept it, but it is too ill fitting in the crotch area, and I'm not very happy about the material. Taking it to the tailor to see if it can be fitted correctly. If not, I will donate it.
B00A7R0LAA|4|Pretty much your run of the mill board shorts nothing special nothing really lacking. They're slightly annoying because the fabric is kind of loud but it gets diminished the more you wear them.
B007C2PVVW|4|Good quality cotton...washed well. I bought these as extra to change the baby often.
B009B5ONXA|4|Fits great, looks great, and it beats the kooky thrift shop tee shirts the kid usually sports when he comes home on the weekends.
B0096I3K72|5|Nice, just as expected.
B000EW4AKA|4|We bought this item for my husband who is a size M, but the pant was not true to the size. It was smaller. But is a very nice fabric and design.
B00PIVWS0G|5|Super fast shipping.  Daughter loves it.
B00I7MG6JC|5|I love all of my Milk Nursingwear tops - but this is my favorite. The flap over the breasts is easy to pull up and provides enough coverage that I never use a nursing cover in public. The stripes are nice and it fits comfortably. It's not so tight that my still-doughy stomach looks terrible, but it fits like a nice top and not a baggy t-shirt.
B008MA42XQ|5|Everything was ok
B008HLGP1W|1|Tangled mess. Can't even get a good 30 seconds in without the wig tangling. I only wanted to use it for a quick makeup tutorial, but unfortunately the wig is badly shaped and not a good quality. To be expected for the price.
B00HQBWK04|5|Got these pajamas for my 3.5 year old son who loves superheroes.  I chose these pajamas because they looked cool and came with a cape. When they arrive, I was not disappointed in the least. These are constructed very well, and the material is light, breathable and soft.  He loves them and asks to wear them every night.
B00EVTR7WK|5|Great quality, thick and adorable! Exactly what I expected to get, a thick stylish hat that'll keep me warm but still look cute!
B00B1OY17M|1|I got this for my kid but the qualityof the shirt is soooo bad with very bad finishing.. Don't recommend at all if you are looking for a high quality products
B002MMQEQI|3|This is a one size fits all costume. My son is 5'8&#34; about 145 lbs and it was snug.  I suppose that is the point of this costume. But for his friend who is 6'3&#34; this costume was tiny! It was very funny. The material however is very cheap and chintzy and the accessories did not hold up well.  Most of the stuff broke.
B00ACIGUBI|3|Shipped fast. Price after checking around, was not as good as a deal as I thought it was
B00JLIU1YC|3|I love this swimsuit but I feel like it should have been made with an underwire to help support the boobs; if I had that I would have given it 5 stars
B002YQ2GBE|5|These were better than expected.  They are nice quality - thick, durable and comfortable.  I ordered for my Mrs. Claus outfit and they are perfect because of how thick they are vs pantyhose.  Very good purchase.
B00AM3Z4D8|5|The jersey's were perfect!! I ordered the Orange and Black and they were made of great material, quality, and color!! I'm not a hockey coach, but a dance coach, and i ordered these for a Halloween performance as Zombie Hockey players, and my team looked amazing in them!! The pictures came out awesome and iron on letters or numbers come out beautifully!!! Well worth the money :)
B00BL33M14|3|My son likes this roller backpack.  The black faded pretty quickly.  I feel it's too expensive for a basic roller backpack (that faded so quickly).  Will get one school year out of it.  Wouldn't buy again if I had the chance.
B00LISQ00M|5|very warm
B00NZRHBHK|1|There is no problem with product fit, but when I was trying to take it off, I did not pay attention to the coins. God! they have very sharp edges. I cut my thumb and ended up having 3 stitches. So be careful!
B00596V35G|5|Surprisingly versatile - add a shawl and heeled sandals for a nice evening look.  Shipping was fast and the dress is great for travel.  You can pretty much wad it up and not worry about wrinkles.
B00BAWA228|4|I thought the swimsuit was beautiful and sexy when I saw it on the web, but i found it didn't give much bust support.  I thought it would give some cleavage, but, as the 1st reviewer stated, the swimsuit leaves your breasts far apart and less fullsome compared to what the picture online looked like.  Also, there isn't much support to make you look skinnier in the tummy area.  It's still a great deal for plus sizes for such a sexy swimsuit, but you may want to use some support undergarments as well with it.
B001TD449U|5|This were very cute and exactly what I was looking for when planning my son's first birthday.  Didn't realize it was going to be so hard to find doggy themed 1st birthday plates at the local party stores in my area.
B008GYNHIO|2|Not what  I expected. The wallet was a different color then the one I ordered, and not leather!  I am returning it!
B008I5857O|5|Very comfortable pair cargo shorts! So far they are the best short to wear around town or at home!
B00LXXJL6W|1|It came in after 3 months in the mail wrapped in only clear plastic. The shirt looked cheaply made with itchy fabric, and when I tried it on it made me look like I was wearing a tarp.
B00GHPF5IY|4|Not too thin, and not too thick...they're just right! They look and feel great. I normally don't buy socks online; however, I'm going to the mid-west to visit friends and needed something warm, yet not too warm. With that said, I wear all different styles of boot-wear during the fall and winter months and didn't want a thick sock. These are perfect!<br /><br />We have cashmere comfort all way down to my toes. The pack included both solid colors and patterns. One solid color, one heal/toe pattern, and three patterned. Some of these socks have a very tight top, so be careful.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 11-16-13
B00265GOH0|5|I purchased this to wear to a Star Trek BBQ party along with the Womens Short Black 60s Pop Icon Wig and the Secret Wishes Go-Go Boots, Black, Large. When I walked into the yard everyone was saying things like 'that's awesome', 'great costume' and 'you look amazing'. The quality was better than I had expected and I was thoroughly pleased with my purchase. Now I can't wait for the Halloween parties to start.
B00L11FARA|4|These run awfully small in the waist.  My great-grandson is quite slim and is a true &#34;6 Slim&#34; fit but these were so small that we couldn't snap them shut.  Rather than return them, I gave them to the young girl across the street who is even thinner.
B00TH22VQ8|4|Very nice
B0007QMK4G|5|After putting on this Instant Slimmer, I actually had curves!!!  First time in years!  And... it was actually very comfortable!  Surprise, surprise!  Would definitely recommend!!!
B00N9YLTN6|5|It is a very cute inexpensive sweater. Keeps you very warm. Fits as expected.
B001E30JVM|5|This just what I needed to replace my bulky wallet. Now I just carry what I need and it doesn't stick out like an extra organ in my pants
B000E96GWI|1|Cheap and poorly stitched. The decal is only printed on one side, not stitched in with thread. I threw it away after wearing it a few times. Too many people thought I was trying to be a gang banger.
B001UQ6X5O|5|I like these socks. Not easy to find ones that are comfortable etc. I recommend them.<br />Feet will not sweat in them and the feeling is good.
B00NAK46FC|5|I thought this was more for yoga but this is for of a shimmery tight to wear in the winter.
B007JB7AXI|4|Seriously, this is the sexiest pair of thigh highs i have ever bought. I really wanted a pair of high class high end elegant thigh highs. Unfortunately, i did not want to pay $100 for a pair of hose. I found this, saw that it's made in italy, and fell in love! I loved it. The only thing i would complain about is the fact that the usps folks took a little longer then expected. It took 4 days to arrive.
B004F9QJ34|4|basically comfortable, good lift. the only thing negative really is that the straps are just long enough with no give at all and kind of bothers my shoulders after a bit which is kind of odd since i'm only 5'3.  It does give me a good silhouette.
B00OK87T7U|5|These boots are ADORABLE! My 1 year old looks so darn cute in them and she gets compliments on them daily! People love the baby Uggs!<br />They're made with great quality, just like the adult sizes and they're super warm for my baby's feet when it's cold outside.
B004HSX4K4|4|Great shirts,  not too warm yet thick enough to take some abuse. They are able to be worked in all day and don't look bad when my shift is over. I usually fit in between a medium or large, and the large fits well. Not too baggy and the sleeves are long enough. The only negative I can mention is that some thread on one cuff button is coming loose after five wears and one wash. Easy fix though.
B000A2KATE|5|These are the pants to get if you are a working man. They are heavy denim and will take a beating. These jeans were built to work. I are hot in the summer because they are made of such heavy fabric. The sizes run small so I found that I have to get the next size bigger.
B00F65OU5K|3|I only reviewed it as &#34;ok&#34; because i believe if it would of fit, I would of given it 5* because its great material.
B005LT3UY8|5|i ordered this for my son Amari and it fits him well. He wore this to church and people admired how he looked in it , especially with that sharp hair cut, they went hand in hand together.
B00CN5B8UG|2|They have changed the picture to make it look more like what you are getting, it isn't big on me, and I got large, because I wanted it draped on me and just all over, but its small and it has already fallen apart after a few weeks! Pointless.
B004U3RW7C|1|This costume is very cheaply made and was supposedly a large. I could barely get it over my chest and it only comes down to about the bottom of my behind!!!
B00CZ3G4HI|2|I wore this style by wacoal for close to a year, daily, and it was by far the most comfortable without losing support. Just ordered a new one via amazon and the 32dd cups are a bit too small this time around. I'm not bigger, it's the bra that isn't the same. I don't get it, wacoal! Now to find a new brand.
B005GYGGTE|1|I'm 5'7 and 130lbs the leggings were see through in the back after a day of wear. They are thin and attract a lot of lint. They also began to ball between my knees from rubbing. I expected more according to the cost and reviews. I'll continue my search.
B00Q3KFPWE|5|Disclaimer:  I received a free or discounted item in exchange for my honest review.  All opinions are my own.<br /><br />This skirt is a very stretchy pencil skirt.  It's pulled up, no zippers.  I'm not quite 5'6&#34;, and a size 4-6.  I purchased the medium and am wearing the skirt in the photo.  It comes down to below my knees and is looser below my knees than I thought it would be and that's just great as I have stairs to conquer repeatedly during my workday.  The black is a good dark black and the material is very soft and comfortable.  I will be wearing this frequently.
B00GJ8DOGE|4|Well made socks and at a great price. Being that I have small feet they were a bit large.
B00K2R3B7A|5|What can I say.... My Daughter LOVES Minnie. Nice soft fabric. Quality silkscreen process used to make the shirt from what I've noticed.
B00E7W0DCC|5|This was a great product, everyone at our Halloween party loved it and I can't wait to go trick or treating with my little flounder.
B00L3EVH0E|5|Love it!
B006OMLTM6|2|After one wash (according the label instructions), the the bands on the sleeves just widened.  I've purchased more affordable short-sleeve shirts from Kohl's, where the bands on the sleeves kept their minor elasticity wash after wash, giving a proper shape to your arm.  With this shirt, it just looks awkward after a wash, as if the sleeves were just stretched wide (which they weren't). Has to do with the material.
B0080GAAO2|5|It took a while for me to get it, but it was worth the wait.  I am very satisfied with it.  I like the security pocket.
B00DW9YXB8|5|Great pattern and color. Looks exactly like the picture. I am 5 feet 5 inches and 128lbs with some booty, and they fit perfectly. If you're any bigger than me, I would NOT recommend purchasing these leggings. Keep in mind that these come from China, and Asian women are much smaller than American women. Only took 1 week to arrive. I am satisfied so far. I haven't worn them out yet, and hopefully they don't start slipping down as I walk. We'll see.
B0098MDI0A|5|this wig was perfect<br />i loved the way it looked on me, a few friends thought it was my real hair
B00UV7H6EA|4|Perfect for a 1920's picnic
B00E1ALO2S|5|I feel so elegant and gorgeous in this dress. Now I have to find somewhere to go. The color is beautiful and it looks good on me. So happy for this purchase.
B0043B2V5E|5|A good hat, well made, and cute to boot. It has held up well though washings and seems to fit great.
B008RTSNYG|5|I got this coat on special, but I would pay full price for it if I had to!  It's a perfect weekend coat.  It's really toasty.  The sub-zero windchill did not phase this coat!  It has a really nice velvety lining in the hood, you can't really tell from the picture.
B003824RPG|5|Perferct fit for my 3 year old and super fast shipping.
B009K95JCQ|5|The dress arrived the next day and looked wonderful. Material was perfect and did not feel cheap or nasty. It fit my 8 year old like a glove and was the perfect dress for her performance. Very unique, beautiful and vintage looking.
B001E766MO|4|I like it. It is a little on the small side but warm and cute.
B00QGJKC5M|4|I love this dress but it's very thin. You can see thru it.
B005ZKUAPA|3|Although this product fits well and is very confortable It annoys me because the fabric produces small balls after just a few wearings. I bought this product last fall and I would hesitate to buy from this manufacturer again.
B008V9NL30|5|It's very warm! My husband bragged how warm this jacket was even in the recent 7 degree weather. I would recommend to anyone!
B001O9BEK6|5|Never going back to less. I have tried many of the leading brands and these retain their shape on and in the wash. No shrink, no stretch. They are soft and thick enough. If my mom had bought these for me every Christmas as a kid, maybe I would have been more excited to receive underpants.
B001HMI0HA|2|Small nail clipper does not work at all and that is the most important part of this set for me<br /><br />Sure wish I could get a replacement piece<br /><br />Will not buy from them again<br /><br />Richard A Dreifuerst
B00Q5L9YIC|5|I ordered a large at first but had to return for a Med. I thought it ran a bit large for my taste. I am a size 8/10 with a 38C and the medium fit be better.
B007G3NRUO|4|This dress is beautifully lightweight and very flattering. It did fit true to size. The material was very thin, but since I live in Texas it is perfect for summer.
B0031U0PO2|5|I bought this for my husband for work to wear with jeans.  It is very stylish and looks great with his Levis.
B00962UM92|4|Had a different brand that didn't fit my head and they kept falling off my ears.<br /><br />These fit snugly on my head and are very comfortable.
B00B3WJVZ4|5|Perfect
B002AQ25HS|1|I wear a 32 waist and those weren't a 32 waist. They don't fit properly. Sizing is off on the website.
B00JOSAG30|1|This shirt is cheap, the graphics are faded, the shirt smelled and it does not look like an adult large. I purchased the shirt for a &#34;Grease,&#34; movie fan; however  I wouldn't dare pass this on. Too much trouble to send back. Horribly disappointed.
B00OOKGQFU|5|So cute! good fit! Pants are long of course but better that than too short!
B001B3FY42|3|It was a simple solution to sizing a tungsten ring I purchase . They have more that one size adjusters to fit just about any size rings.
B00K72D4WM|2|Looks cheap. Makes me look like a Grandma. Material smells
B0015BKKC6|4|This sports bra fits nicely.  I love that it is easier to put on and get off  as the front zipper protects my shoulders.
B0057AP0WG|5|Nice Bi-Fold,  Easy to organize all of my cards and notes.  Good feeling that all of my credit cards are protected from identity theft.
B00KZCBSSQ|3|She loved it
B00L6CXR2E|3|returned
B000U7QGDS|5|Absolutely perfect!  Extremely pleased.
B001FOR27Y|5|it looks better in person and it is a good deal
B004WI3HL0|5|THis is like the other Disney Bodysuits I purchased - excellent quality - 2 rows of snaps to grow with   it did not shrink and is sooo soft.
B00B2QGL9U|5|Great colors, roomy, Comfortable. I will probably purchase several other colors. I got a medium but will probably get a small next time
B00O57RKIE|5|True to size. Super cute. Great quality material. Easy to wash and wear. Love the matching doll outfit.
B009IONWBS|5|The waffle Katan is a little big, but worth purchasing none the less. In relation to other Katans that I have this one is much lighter, more natural and fits the four corners correctly. As a Rabbi who can tie Tzitzit myself, the Kaful Shemoneh was Halachically accurate- Meeting the Kosher guidelines of Tora- B'Midbar 15.38, Dvarim 22.12. Baveli Talmud- Menachot 39-42. Shulchah Aruch- Orach Chayim 8-25, 11.12-13 and they have the Kesher Elyon,<br />Hulya 7-8-11-13. I have before getting this product the Plain Katans and the Jersey Knit Katans and this one is much lighter, far more fitting and the corners are shown in accordance with Halakha. I will be ordering more.<br />Toda Raba Bechonot Rabbi Aminadav A. Hinton
B00NHU2LSE|2|VERY thin fabric, not good quality. Top is WAY too short! Needs to be at least 3-4&#34; longer. This falls exactly AT the waist.
B0040PI31Y|4|It fit prefect !
B00G7G061E|3|These are a bit larger than what I was expecting. I based the size off of what I wear in the \\"itse bitse\\" brand and they are not quite identical. However, they are comfortable and I like the designs and colors, I just wish there were more options available.  If you buy the itse bitse brand, order one to two sizes smaller, otherwise, you'll feel like you're wearing granny panties.
B00NF0XQVM|2|Had to return, too small.
B00DYOQFO4|5|Love this dress. Just a heads up, you can feel the sequins poking you a bit, not too bad though. Beautiful dress!
B00Q6DXIKE|1|It's a good ten dollar wig, but it claims to be a light lavender color. I received a deep saturated purple.  It shipped faster than the earliest expected time though.
B00D00J0US|3|They stay on quite well however they show about 1/2&#34; of material out of typical mary-jane type flats...which is what I wear. Also, I ordered all grey and black and got the mixed package. NOT what I ordered. Couldn't contact seller and just didn't have time to wait to ship back and wait for the correct product.
B00422MCVW|5|This product is same i expected, excellent product and good quality<br />I bought this product thanks to all reviewers and opinions..
B00DDXRCCA|4|I have 4 of these shirts.  They all fit as expected.  I do not find the arms short, if anything they are longer than I would like.  One thing that I notice is that the colors I have seem to be different thickness.  The grey is lighter than the orange.  The dark blue is heavier than the light blue.  The green seems heaviest of all... maybe its my imagination.  I work in the Bakken so summer is hot, but not scorching.  I wouldn't want to wear these in South Texas, but so far they have been fine for me up to 95 degrees.  FYI, I am a vac truck driver.  I am only out of the truck on location for a max of about 3 hours at a time.  These shirts are way better than paying Bakken prices for carhartt.
B002M58HXS|5|My daughter and I both purchased the twister costume and it was cute to death.  The head piece would not stay on our heads and it was extremely thin so we had to wear turtle necks and leggins underneath.  All in all we were the best looking twins.
B003RM6D0Y|5|Great item.  Arrived on time, and came as depicted and described. Would not have a problem ordering from this company again.
B0043O8EL6|3|Way too boxy. The size was not proportionate to the shirt. The chest button and arm holes were very tight. I was very disappointed.
B00QK2RJXI|4|it's very good. the clothes quality is very nice
B00SBD80CS|1|The fabric is REALLY thin, and not in a good way.  Feels pretty cheap, I was hoping for a better quality Tshirt, especially for the price.  If you don't care about quality and feel of the shirt, the design is good.
B00JELQ280|5|I own 20+ zippy bibs and love this style for a change. The shape doesn't allow the tip to curl up at all when being washed. Not a huge deal to flatten the others before I lay to dry but this one no thought is needed. And I found it sits flatter against my baby's chest. Zippy please, pretty please make more color/prints with this style.
B000TR59QO|5|Awesome color combo and great value.
B00IRMQBFQ|4|I love the material of them both, and they did fit good,  I like how the dresses form to my body.
B00IEZNKFA|5|It a sexy looking one piece for your lady when she feel like she want's to wear something sexy for you on that special night1
B00D0TAJAO|5|Great
B000133XCS|5|the jacket is of very good quality.  I would like to veiw matching products
B00NBNVBSI|3|I do not feel it is a cotton fabrick.  The size is good.
B00GGSG3UG|3|they were a little small and the material was really thin so they are a little see though. just order a size up and you should be fine
B00F932YYS|5|Loved them thanks again
B0015YJBDC|5|This came fast and matched the dress and tights we ordered perfectly! It is sooooo cute, I can't wait to see how she looks in it.
B002SG7AUM|3|I ordered a gown in the PREEMIE size so my newborn would have a Christmas outfit that wouldn't swallow him up (he was due on the 15th, but arrived on the 12th) Compared to the several other preemie sized clothes I have this is no where near a preemie size. It does have a smaller neck opening, but it is just a tad bit smaller/slimmer in the body when compared with other newborn sized gowns. My baby is now over9lbs and the gown fits him perfectly, but for someone buying for a true preemie sized baby it would swallow them up! This sizing issue is my only reason for the lower rating.<br /><br />The gown is well made, and like the other posters said it is great to find a side snapping gown, I never understood why all gowns aren't made that way since it is very awkward pulling a gown over a wobble-headed newborn!
B00GM53ARM|2|Odd angle. Should have noticed that from the picture. It's like it is designed for an erection. Problem is that while it stretches to accommodate length it isn't wide enough for girth.
B00CMSU2WE|5|Love it! All of my books, Ipad and computer fit perfectly; with plenty of room to spare.
B00G4V0ZIG|5|The trousers arrived on time, are a perfect fit, and the quality is always what I expect from Dockers.  To get them at this price is a real bargain.  What would I do without Amazon?
B005FN1VBY|3|Good quality bra, but slightly on the small side as far as fit.  Comfortable light weight fabric with removable cups.
B0018SRLQ4|5|What can I say, was a little skeptical buying suits from the Internet, not only was it excellent value, the suits were of high-quality material and the service was impeccable. I highly recommend purchasing from this company. Please keep up the good work and thank you for all your support and great suits!
B003PBYMLE|5|This shirt is awesome! The image of Bigfoot stands out. Love this shirt. I have not come across a shirt like this anywhere else,if your into Bigfoot its the shirt for you if not it's still one he'll of a shirt! Buy one NOW and wear it to your next big event like a wedding and have everyone talking about how crazy you and your shirt are!!!
B00166X6W6|5|Great delivery time and Great Shirt!
B006V766K4|2|Super tight 14. Wife is Disappointed. Took tag off so now stuck with them.
B00AWO103A|5|This outfit is very cute and well made.  My 6yo granddaughter loves it.
B00OZKW7Q6|5|Love it
B00AHTK0EA|4|I like this sport bra and although it is a little snug it does not move around while exercising and doing yoga which I love!
B001S2PPKY|3|the colors for Def Leppard Pyromania actual image printing that I received is not as colorful as picture. a bit disappointing. t-shirt is good quality.
B00J2SSI64|5|Love these jeans.  They are a dark wash, which are very flattering and sit a little below the belly button, so NO &#34;MUFFIN TOP&#34;.  Yeah!
B009GES54E|4|I've worn the Comfort Devotion Demi Bras for quite awhile, decided to try the extra coverage version. I ordered the same size, the fit was as great with this bra as with the demi-bras. It's just a bit more than I need. I am a B-cup, and this overwhelmed my torso.
B001L9TD7K|4|Really love the product and material. I just wish my chunky upper half would fit in it! Maybe I should lose some weight :)
B003OQTS46|4|Nice, but too thin for foreign money.  If you live anywhere that has bills larger than U.S. This is kinda annoying.
B002ZG6XB2|5|For those who like an underwire bra, this is a comfortable style.  It washes well and seems to be lasting with neither shrinkage or stretching in the laundry. I fine the white color keeps its brightness after a few months of wear.
B00DFJLWSM|5|A gorgeous tie! The picture hardly does it justice, and the price very reasonable for the quality of the product!
B00AMC8JWW|5|I bought this for my granddaughter to wear on a cruise. She will be 11 months old then.<br />It's cute and looks like it will was well.
B008BAN81E|1|Paper-thin real leather COATED fiber of some kind. Very cheaply made, not even worth the cheap price. Went straight to the garbage.
B00BGUQ4TY|5|I like it need to order a few more
B00E4U8Y8W|5|The sweater that I received was perfect; I especially loved the extra-long sleeves as I have long arms and seldom find long sleeves that fit properly.
B0071NGTOU|5|My nephew loved this jacket. It made a perfect x-mas present for a FOX lover. Heads up, though, the jacket does run a little smaller than a normal boys medium. You might want to order the next size up.
B00GL2UYRA|2|Really cheaply made and thin. Would never buy again
B00FYEYVUW|3|I wear a size 18 and purchased an XX-Large Petite (I'm 5' 5&#34; in height and weigh 210). The rise of the pant is perfect as is the length. The fabric is comfortable to wear and perfect for summer. The pant fits perfectly in the butt area. The tummy area is a bit large. The pant is very nice looking. Hopefully this help with your choice. Perfect if you have a full tummy.
B002T3FXYE|4|I'm used to bathrobes that end just above the knees, have not-quite-full sleeves, and have no hoods. It was quite a revelation to get this bathrobe from Amazon and try it on. It's thick, it really is full-length, as are the sleeves, and the hood is, well, a hood. The cloth is fairly thick and it keeps me quite warm. I'm a big guy, at 6'1\\" and slightly overweight, and the Large/XL size fit me quite well.<br /><br />The only caveat I'd add is that you should wash this in cold water and, at least for the first few washes, either hang dry or tumble dry with no heat in order to prevent shrinkage.<br /><br />The one thing I can't know just yet is how long this bathrobe will last. I'll update this review in a few months with that information.<br /><br />Update: It's been several months now and the bathrobe is still doing well. I'm very pleased with the purchase.
B00JWXQANC|4|The quality is not 100 per cent but for the price its good. Fits well, so I am happy with that.
B00L44WIMO|5|Beautiful bolero
B00EWWHZO6|5|Size 5 panties are really hard to find and these are great and a perfect fit which is even harder to find.
B006MQZ9L6|2|They arrived covered with animal hair and dust, I didn't even bother to try them on because of how filthy they were out of the package.
B00067G36W|4|Pretty big.  If you have a tiny waist, you'll have a big knot
B00H1YYVKI|3|I did not expect the shirt to be as shear as it is, meaning that the fabric is translucent and you can see skin tone or an undershirt beneath it.  Another oddity - the tag says 'dry clean only', but it is a cotton-polyester blend; needless to say, I've ignored that cleaning instruction.  I do, though, wash on a delicate cycle as the fabric is not &#34;tough&#34;.  The shirt could be ironed using a steamer rather than an iron, ala Shark Steamer.
B00817DZWO|5|My hubby loves these tee's. There comfortable and wear and wash nice! I plan on getting him more :)
B00MF9O8T8|3|Little bigger sized than expected, but very beautiful in style
B005GYGEWS|5|Nice exercise capris. Sweat is absorbed & one feels good in them. Fit well and they stay in place even through exercises.
B00AGI905W|5|I read the reviews.  I bought a larger size than I normally would.  it fit great.
B0076S9SQQ|5|Exactly what we wanted!
B00HY90BGS|4|Even though I would have preferred a higher cotton blend, these were very comfortable on my sz 10 feet and did not interfere with my circulation.
B006UJIGOC|5|Thanks
B00CBAOLTI|5|MY SON LOVES THE THIN SET AS WELL;; AS THE THICK SET TO KEEP HIM WARM UP HERE IN N,Y,
B001LVI44Q|5|This was purchased for our great grandson who is 8 going on 20 and wants to be a policeman when he grows up.  This has been his wish for as long as he could talk.  He loved the hat.  It is well made and he wears it constantly
B00CNQ1FNA|5|I bought 3 of these shirts, one gray, blue and tan. I am only going to write a review for one of them Amazon. I love all three, colors are nice and true, quality of material very good. I have not washed them yet and if they turn out to truly be wrinkle free then I will order more.
B008TZ3AOG|3|I was surprised by how hard the fabric/cloth is, it felt like sheet of paper rather than soft fabric. I thought it will brake. This is why I put it in hot water for the night. It didn't release much color, which is good and now it's much softer and ready to use. Nice bright color and it's really double-side printed. I think it will get softer with the use.<br />I put in 3 just because I was expecting something much much softer as I usually imagine cotton as soft fabric.
B00MZHSQUC|3|I got this for my wife to wear as a base layer.  She's a slim lady & usually wears a medium in everything.  I got her an XL.  The XL is small for my medium sized wife.  It fits snugly and it's quite short in the sleeves and legs.  It works great for under other clothes, as it doesn't stick out, but it would be better if the cut were a good bit longer, especially considering the size.<br /><br />--&#62; Whatever size you normally wear - get two sizes larger & expect a snug (but comfortable), short fit &#60;--<br /><br />All that said about the size, my wife wears hers a good bit & it does help keep her warm.
B008S0J14U|5|Great deal and decent quality....I like that they come in such a huge package....I mean who just buys one pair of socks? Not me!
B00A04CIBA|5|I got this for a gift for my husband. He absolutely loves it.<br />It's a tight fit for his DL & such... but last time I checked when you buy a brand new wallet, thats how it's supposed to be.<br />I would buy again :)
B004OSJTJ2|3|These nightshirts are large and I cannot see them as a S-L or one size fits all. They are not as comfortable as I wanted, the neckline is uncomfortable and they are just not for me.  I think I would have done better buying a mans over-sized tee shirt.  Not something I wold buy again.
B00290NDDU|3|I got these for my teen son who battles runny noses everyday and he walks around with a wad of paper towel in his pocket. I thought I'd upgrade him and get him handkerchiefs like my dad use to carry. He uses them so that's good.
B00GICLT72|5|I purchased this a while back and the white time said around January 29th.<br /><br />I ordered this for a pillowfight on the 10th and I managed to receive this on the 8th! The item came even faster than I expected and it fits perfectly.<br /><br />I was kind of worried about the size but I just ordered what I usually wear for regular clothing and it works perfectly.
B00GGH09HK|1|picture is completely misleading...it went straight to goodwill. I'm not sure how people can get away with false advertising like this.
B00I4BX798|4|Gorgeous bra, tiny area both closures scratchiness easily fixed with tiny flannel patches.  Fantastic/perfect fit!
B00DEK5LXO|4|This is a very comfortable bra, which I am not accustomed to finding at my size.  However, after washing them a few times on regular cycle instead of delicates, the wire started slipping out the side.  I am rough on my bras, but this didn't last as long as I hoped.
B005EE2R2G|2|Well, it looks great in the photo. Sadly, what you can't see is the label: The fabric is not 100% cotton, but a flimsy 50/50 polyester blend. The trim, at the bottom and wrists, is a very cheesy, thin polyester. The poly/cotton blend is so lightweight you can see through it easily, so it doesn't have the heft or cozy feel of sweatshirt-weight cotton. More surprising, at this price and with HK's stamp, is the poor construction -- the seams are lumpy and sewn clumsily, so the shirt doesn't lie flat where it should, and it hangs asymmetrically. There is bunching and puckering throughout.<br /><br />If you do decide to buy one of these, I'd suggest going down a size. I'm about a size 6 or 8, and the medium was enormous on me. I ordered this [the long sweatshirt], and the dolman-sleeve sweatshirt, and the T-shirt dress, some for myself and some as Christmas gifts. I returned them all. This review holds true for all three designs.<br /><br />I give 2 stars, not one, because I think the garments, as designed, could have been wonderful. It's what happened to them after the design was complete that ruined them. Heidi's Project Runway wisdom should have been evoked before these things passed through quality control: \\"It looks a little home-sewn. If they had executed it in a beautiful way with beautiful materials,\\" she would say, \\"They should be impeccable.\\"
B0061YW6X8|5|Hat is very well made. Fit is as advertised. Would purchase more products of this type again. Would recommend this to anyone<br />  looking for a stylish, comfortable hat.
B00M63GPAS|5|Arrived on time, I'm very satisfied
B00Q7AHVKO|5|This is my new favorite shirt!!!
B00O58L502|5|Super soft shirt. I got my boy several Tshirts for Christmas. This one is his favorite.  It seems like I can hardly get it off him to wash it.
B002EUBBRA|5|Husband loved wearing this for Halloween.
B000BYAEK6|5|Our teenage son for a school dance wanted to \\"go outside the box\\" and add to the usual dress shirt, slacks and tie.  He added the suspenders, an arm garter and winged tip shoes for an INCREDIBLE look! (Hats aren't allowed.) Admiring looks and comments from everyone!   The suspenders are a very nice quality and color.  They arrived quickly and were a very fair price!!  THANKS!!!
B000KGKBOO|5|Outstanding jacket very warm even in winter winds.  A little puffy at first
B00F2T56GW|5|I really can&#34;t describe it but it smooth warm cozy & comfortable  it keep you worm in the winter month you will feel like a baby with her blanky
B00PXPI2MA|3|If you have a belly, the wastebasket will roll up.
B00Y3UKVM0|3|Fit as expected. I where a 12 and the size 12 was perfect. Unfortunately there are some flaws. The belt is super chintzy and made out of a plastic, pleathery material. The seam for the waist sits well below the belt and makes an odd ridge around the tummy. Also the fabric pattern doesn't line up between the top and bottom portions and looks off.
B003TJO8E8|4|my girlfriend is a size 0 and although this was the smallest size offer these were very large in comparison to other small panties I recently purchased for her.
B0038NWUMM|3|The quality is good, but sizes are smaller then regular belts in a store. In other words, if all my pants and belts are 34, then I should order 36 or 38size to fit me. Also, you have to pay for return shipping.
B008S1XB9A|5|Grandson loved it! Christmas present.
B008P5OJHW|5|very nice top,love it!
B00NGVN5Z2|5|This tunic right here is bangin'! I mean it will turn a regular outfit into a sexy outfit without you having to show skin! I just feel very sexy and lady like in it. I bought a few more in other colors!
B00653YU84|5|This costume exceeded my expectations.  The quality and fit were great.
B00DNO3JTO|2|Not only was the small too small (I wear size 4 jeans) the material felt like tights. It was like one of those bad dreams about showing up in school with out your pants on!
