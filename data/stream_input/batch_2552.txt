0780626494|5.0|A great all around science fiction movie, one almost anyone would enjoy.<br />One thing I liked was there was no sex scenes with naked people all around.<br />A nice family romantic comedy movie<br /><br />.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I bought this because of a couple songs and I ended up loving the whole cd. Worth the money because all the songs are good :D
B00APUTEBG|2.0|This film is hardly entertaining. The story is impossible to believe. It's too bad for Bruce Willis, Segourney Weaver and the others actors.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|I can't stop listening to the whole album, and it just gets better every time I listen.  It's unique, catchy, thrashy, and everything I expected!  Congrats to Megadeth on their 14th studio album!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I've liked very much this movie from Lasse Hallström. He always told such beautiful stories in his movies (Chocolat, What's eating Gilbert Grape). This one is not the best but there is a good suspense. We understand little by little the story of this young woman, she lived the drama and now begins a love story in this charming seaside town.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I'm not much of a fan to speak of, but my wife loves this movie.<br />So I would give this a five-start rating based on her reviews.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great story, but it was long and had some unnecessary characters. The beginning was sort of slow but developed into something totally different
B00C061HZY|5.0|Entire album is full of funk! the vinyl is very aesthetically pleasing and and perfect condition. comes with a downloadable code for you to listen to the album on your computer or mobile device! well worth the money!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|So fun to play!<br />Worth the dollar amount I think. Plus omnom is super cute! Great spin on the original
1250010403|5.0|Have never read Jeffrey Archer before can highly recommend The Clifton Chronicles as a first time read of this author, still reading The Sins of the Father, but looking forward to Only time will tell. I like the way he tells each individual's story from their own perspective.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|So this is supposed to be a pro version?<br />I've tested numerous battery savers/analyzers, and this one is a bit too basic.<br />You have NO graph that shows you the level history.<br />You can NOT customize the appearance.<br />You do NOT have a calculation for different usage.<br />If you go to the \\"usage\\" option in the advanced section, all it does is show you the device page of your Kindle.<br />It does the job but there's nothing professional about it.<br />I hate to give a bad review but I compared and found this app wanting.<br />Tested on Kindle Fire HD.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is crazy addictive and it isn't so challenging as to be frustrating or so easy that it's boring. It's great quality for a free app and i would this recommend this app to anyone
B00CL68NOG|1.0|Not funny. Can be depressing at times. The best parts of the movie were on the trailer.<br />Don't waste your money.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|While this novel in the series may not be for everyone since it is a bit slower and evolving story of romance and intrigue, I found it to be 5 Star reading for myself.<br /><br />The romance is really at the heart of this novel but the title indicates that this is going to take some time ..... and it does.  I enjoyed the whole book, no scanning but you have to enjoy the building stress and the author keeps you wondering what kind of horrible thing might happen to shatter this bubble the couple are trying to live inside of for much of the book.<br /><br />Since there are plenty of other 5 Star reviews I just wanted to add mine to the mix since this was undoubtedly one of the better things i have read in months and the fact that it was slow and steady romance intertwined into the story of political intrigue it was wonderful.  I kept wondering when there was going to be a big betrayal like we usually see but just when I thought I had figured out that part ........... (nope, not gonna tell LOL)
B00CCF7ODM|5.0|I watched this to be honest with no expectations. Having watched Rififi, which I particularly enjoyed for its excitement and realism, and having watched Bob le Flambeur, which I didn't particularly enjoy, as I said I came to Touchez Pas Au Grisbi just hoping I would like it and nothing more.<br /><br />Well, what can I say? I really enjoyed this movie, and Jean Gabin, the chief player in the movie, is more understated and stoic as a gang boss, than temperamental and over the top, and all the other actors played believable parts which for me help the plot, and the twist and turns in the plot, go well.<br /><br />The heist of the movie has already taken place before the movie starts, and revolves around two aging gangsters trying to get around 50 million francs for gold bullion. While they are waiting for the (considerably lot less) money, another gangster has other plans, and kidnaps one of the gangsters to swap him in return for the loot. I won't tell you the plot any further, and if you like French films, and particularly French gangster films, I think you will enjoy this a lot, as I did.
0375869026|5.0|I never thought I would love a book written for younger readers. This small gem is not only a great read but the message is so important that it should be read by everyone, especially school age children. Please, please read it and you will, as I did, make it required reading for your children and grandchildren. Congratulations to the author
0385504225|5.0|It seems we're all very different kinds of people; imagine a world where we were all the same; all liked the same food, the same music, the same holidays, and all dressed and looked the same! It would be a VERY boring world if this was so. But thankfully we are all different!<br /><br />I have read most of Dan Brown's novels, except 'Angels & Demons' and I am currently reading 'Digital Fortress'. I am enjoying it as well. I sense that with Dan Brown, because he is MEGA-successful, that somehow being successful and of course making pots of money with it, this somehow negates his worth as a writer. I am not so sure of this! I have immensely enjoyed everything I have read so far by Dan Brown and I look forward, as many of us do, to his next venture, whenever and whatever that will be. There is definitely in Britain a sense that if something or someone becomes very successful, then somehow it loses its value. Its hard to explain this, but it is in some ways a kind of snobbery, and a reaction against runaway success of whatever kind. Maybe its a kind of jealousy. Why can't we just be glad if someone makes it, instead of sneering and pretending to be indifferent?! Don't we all dream of being runaway successes? I certainly do.<br /><br />Anyway, I really liked 'the Lost Symbol' a whole lot, and it kept me hooked from beginning to end, I felt it was that good. Yes, I'll contend that after reading most of Dan Brown's books, that there is a similarity to most of them, and they all have short chapters, and so on. But many great writers work have similar themes; just check out Dickens work to see that. So, I think rather than being hyper-critical of Dan Brown, we should see him in the light he really is; that of a successful writer, writing generally accessible and populist literature for a mass world market. Who writes who doesn't want that sort of success?!!<br /><br />Dan Brown's novels then may be the equivalent of good fast food, but after all, why not? Who doesn't like fish and chips when they're on holiday, or a burger and fries with coke now and again?sh and chips when they're on holiday, or a burger and fries with coke now and again?
B0063IH60K|1.0|Downloaded version 2.1.1 onto my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it quickly has become the software I love to hate.  Maybe it's the Kindle (THAT would be no surprise,) but I'm guessing that at least some of the maddening quirks are software crap.<br /><br />OCD players, such as myself, run these games over and over and like the statistics features of the game.  However, what's with:<br /><br />* The winning streak count resets to zero whenever it feels like it (even once when I was within a couple of games of 1000 straight wins.)<br /><br />* The &quot;deal a winable hand&quot; feature randomly crashes and the software deals an unwinable hand.  That's especially grand news, again, when one is running up a long set of consecutive wins.<br /><br />* For no identifiable reason, the software will log in a loss even though there have been none.  (Although, I did discover that just winning a game does not record a win unless you wait through the maddeningly long stupid little victory graphic of dancing cards.  If you win, then simply deal a new hand, that records as a loss.)<br /><br />Today, with almost 7000 wins logged, the son-of-a-bitch just zeroed out the entire stats section and thinks that I've done a fresh install.  Well, I was reading a book on this Kindle earlier.  Maybe that's punishment from the software for ignoring it for so long.  I'm so angry at this POS right now that I'd like to log it as a minus 5 stars.
B00328G4V6|3.0|I have been a Hendrix fan for yonks now, and will very probably remain one all my life. At the height of his considerable powers, I suppose basically at the end of the 60's, he was an unstoppable force, an amazing talent and virtuoso guitarist the likes of which the world hadn't seen before. He shook up the music world, and has left a legacy of great music and great musicianship that still enthrals the world to this day. His playing and music is copied and emulated all over the world now, with huge numbers of people trying to play like him, and of course trying to understand him and his motivations for playing the way he did. He was a musical genius, who not only could play utterly magnificently but could also compose wonderful pieces too. He was technically gifted as a guitarist, but was also a brilliant improviser too, not always qualities that come together in musicians; its often one or the other; I know, I'm a guitarist too!<br /><br />I bought this album 'Valleys of Neptune' a while back, as I wanted to savour it and really enjoy it when I was in the mood. My first impression was that, at least, I had not heard of any of the tracks before, in the sense that, although I have heard 'Stone Free' and 'Bleeding Heart' and others before, they were different versions. That helps a lot; they are at least original new recordings. And as I played the cd the other day, to be quite frank, I did enjoy listening to it, but I will always enjoy listening to Hendrix to be honest. I've reviewed another Hendrix cd, which was chronic, but this isn't; it's a reasonable cd for a new release.<br /><br />To sum up, I enjoyed listening to this cd and will listen to it again, but its only got three stars because it isn't brilliant to my mind, just pretty good. I really enjoyed listening to the 'Jimi Hendrix: Blues' cd however! If you like Blues and Jimi Hendrix, I can recommend this cd a whole lot! I may even write a review of it!

B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Great game for stretching the minds of your little ones. They enjoy a cute game and you know they are working their mental muscles.
B00D41H2PS|5.0|This is my favorite kind of point and click adventure game.  Perfectly nice graphics, no drawn-out, boring, cinematically poor &#34;clip&#34; scenes that take forever to tell you what you need to know, and best of all -- no hidden objects!  None!  Just puzzles that are perfectly doable if you pay attention to what you see.  Yes, like all these games, it runs you around a lot.  The navigation system isn't the best, but it isn't terrible.  You don't have to read a journal, like in some games that are so unintuitive that they need to lead you by the hand and tell you what to do.  You do need to have a pencil handy to write down things.  There's no map, but I don't think you will need one.  Is the game long or short?  That depends on you.  For me it was long because I managed to repeatedly miss one item I needed to pick up.  How I didn't see it I don't know.  However, overall it is much shorter than games that cost more.  If you get stuck, go to the Magic Frame Studios Facebook page.  There is a post there with a link to a video walk-through.  (You won't find it by Googling; at least I didn't.)<br /><br />I really enjoyed this game and will buy more by this developer.  UPDATE:  I paid $1.29 plus tax.  That is a fair price.  Since Magic Frame Studios changed to One Connection Media, the price has increased to $1.99, which is too much for this game.

1419553429|1.0|Wow. First of all, the over-hyped tone of this book becomes incredibly obnoxious (\\"If GMAT perfection is what you're looking for, you've come to the right place!\\"). The format doesn't flow with the format of their core GMAT prep book. But worst of all - there are MANY questions with errors. Check out the data sufficiency example problem on page  343 for an example of this embarrassment.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this book. It offers no insights, only questions that (while sometimes difficult) often look nothing like actual GMAT questions and contain mistakes in the answers. I'm sure the authors of this book took the GMAT, scored too poorly to attend a top school, and settled for authorial posts for which they weren't qualified.
B00B7364H2|5.0|The golden age of vinyl recording is not merely a catchphrase or some vague reminiscence of a few older, graying audiophiles. It was an era in which a small group of creative engineers and producers, naive optimists all, believed that the marriage of technology and music meant that recorded music could and should sound as alive and powerfully present as a live performance. And before \\"less is more\\" became a trendy mantra, they had discovered that with a few carefully chosen and placed microphones, one could reproduce the sound of a live performance to a remarkable degree. The story of the Mercury Living Presence label is beautifully told in Discophage's reviews and does not require retelling by me.<br /><br />Wilma Cozart Fine deserves the credit for these recordings existing in their CD incarnation (as well as in their vinyl birth) and she seems to have had an unerring ear and an uncanny knack for producing recordings that featured a beautifully detailed, wonderfully deep soundstage. If you own a pair of audiophile grade headphones that can handle Classical music with all of its complexity, try listening to any of the Antal Dorati or Paul Paray recordings included in this set and listen to their stunning breadth and depth. You will hear the most delicate effects produced by a triangle or celesta somehow emerge utterly unscathed from a forest of brass and winds. In a modern recording such detail is usually submerged in a wash of sound that has been artificially produced by multiple takes that are digitally snipped together as a result of quickly recorded sessions during the small window of time that musician's union rules allow.<br /><br />In our modern era, great recordings are produced by rare accident. In the golden era of vinyl, great recordings were routinely produced by talent and a passion for music. This second set of Mercury Living Presence recordings is the embodiment of that passion. Despite the fact that several of the orchestras recorded here are of less than first tier greatness, somehow their recorded performances are memorable and moving. Paray's recordings of French composers with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra rival some of the finest ever made under Ansermet, Munch or Boulez. Dorati's Bartok recordings have the authenticity and mysterious, disturbing violence that the composer was somehow able to extract from Hungarian and Transylvanian folk music and his own troubled psyche. Dorati's Beethoven and Dvorak are probing and expansive. His Tchaikovsky and Respighi are lyrical, passionate and emotionally satisfying.<br /><br />This second set contains some of the finest of the Howard Hanson and Frederick Fennell recordings. The three Hanson symphonies included here are the best versions ever recorded. The other choices, for the most part, are of exceptional quality or at least of intrinsic interest. They were certainly some of the most popular of Mercury's recordings at the time. The Fennell recordings are better selections than in the first set, which featured a plethora of wind band music that one might hear in a Victorian gazebo at high noon in July. The Mozart and Holst discs are especially fine, with spirited performances that are recorded with exceptional detail and, yes, presence.<br /><br />If music is your passion and recorded sound the way you indulge that passion, you owe it to yourself to hear it at its finest. This is a life affirming collection, sensibly priced with limited availability. Do not dawdle: the first set sold out quickly and can now only be purchased at extortionate prices. There is a reason why: these are some of the most glorious examples of vinyl's golden age and such excellence may never come your way again. Don't say I didn't warn you!<br /><br />Mike Birmans than first tier greatness, somehow their recorded performances are memorable and moving.

B00BUAEYVK|3.0|I love the DIE HARD series. It has been one of the most consistent as far as entertainment and quality goes. Perhaps in the action genre,only the Lethal Weapon films can also stake tat claim. But unfortunately, the 5th time around is not the charm for John McClane. The story concerns McClane going to Russia,to offer support for his son-in prison and wrapped up in a high profile trial of a Russian national.The father/son pair meet up and butt heads as they try to outrun the terrorists pursuing the trio,and get to safety.<br /><br />SO...the good?<br />*It has all the action you'd want/expect from a DIE HARD film.<br />*Marco Beltrami also seems to be more comfortable in doing an action score that fits this franchise,and while i would have liked more of Michael Kamens themes-i cant really complain.<br />*A new location. They dont over-do it and slam a sign that says 'Were in Russio,heres a landmark!\\" in your face so,while the film takes place outside the US,the subtle presentation lets you enjoy it or ignore it,depending which you prefer.<br /><br />Ah...the bad:<br />*The runtime. The film is barely an hour and 40 minutes long-at least 20 minutes shorter than it should be. Why the rush? It feels as though there was a whole other part to the movie that got scrapped...<br />*Where are the police? We hear a siren and see a cruiser fly by,and that is enough for the film-makers i guess.<br />*No fights? A few fists get thrown,but come on-wheres the down and dirty battle? Take the fight with Karl in DIE HARD, or the fight with Maggie Q's character in LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Even if John Sr is too old for karate-chopping,let the son pick up the slack...thats what he's there for right?<br />*John Jr/Jack...yes,he's presented as the lead and John is the sidekick...maybe its just because that fits the story more. Blehh<br />*Scenes in the trailer that didnt make the cut (ohh..more half-naked biker chick..sigh)<br /><br />How it could have been better: You could solve 2 problems in one fell swoop. If they had introduced a Russian detective,who was following the Terrorists and McClane duo..youd have<br />*a longer runtime<br />*an opportunity for a few quite moments,that weren't a sappy/macho blend,and could help give the audience a better look at the 'characters'<br />*a simply more rounded,grounded film<br /><br />Im not saying it would have been the best of the series,but it of been better received if it was at least the quality of DIE HARD 2<br /><br />so its not as awful as some reviewers claim,and as an action movie its just fine...a decent mindless extravaganza of violence. But as a film with the banner Die Hard...it misses a bit. If the film-makers had a checklist of what makes it a John McClane adventure,they checked off most of it.<br />So is it the weakest of the series,yes. Is it the 'Leonard Part 6\\" of action movies..no. You'll enjoy it if you really like the first 4,you just might find yourself upset that they made no more effort than the checklist.in one fell swoop.

B0039TAHMA|2.0|SPOILERS!<br /><br />Here are my point by point thoughts on The Two Towers:<br /><br />--Right from the start, this film opens with a sequence more cartoonish than anything in Fellowship.  It later provides a shoddy rationalization to bring Gandalf back from the dead.  I feel that this trivializes his death in Fellowship, which was one of the more effectively dramatic moments in that film.  I guess an apparent death results in one's return as a \\"whiter\\" version of oneself.  Gandalf struts around like nothing happened.  Also, when someone says that they were \\"sent back\\" from heaven \\"until my task is completed\\", I get the impression that they are borderline invincible.  This diminishes any sense of danger in the storyline for this character, and also diminishes the theme of death in the film overall.<br /><br />--Another problem I have is with Gollum, who is annoying as soon as he appears.  I suppose that's a personal gripe, but his mannerisms are rather obnoxious and hammy.  He's practically unwatchable.  His character is also a substandard attempt at writing a character with fake complexity.  Gollum shifts between evil jerk and loyal nutcase.  That's about it.  One understands the character completely the moment his split personalities present themselves.  Unfortunately, this shift in personality is repeatedly hammered into the viewer's brain.  Yes, we got it the first time it was shown.  Simply shifting between two thin personalities dozens of times does not create character depth or complexity.  Also, was there ever a question that his evil jerk personality would ultimately emerge as the dominant one?  At no point during these films did I think that he would choose NOT  to steal the ring (even for a second), and I didn't even read the books.  His inner conflict feels meaningless and superfluous to me.<br /><br />--The drab visuals make for some tedious viewing.  Everything is gray.  The environments are gray.  The skies are gray.  The bad guys are gray.  Gollum isgray.  The orcs are gray.  The weapons are gray.  The buildings are gray.  The color scheme is way too monotonous and repetitive.<br /><br />--The stifling effects of the ring were already established by the end of Fellowship.  We saw the effects of the ring on a variety of characters, so it's certainly frustrating that Two Towers continues to harp on this subject without further elaboration or complexity.  Frodo, Sam, and Gollum basically just walk through gray environments for 3 hours while complaining about the ring's effects.  We already spent 3 hours in Fellowship explaining this issue, and Two Towers brings nothing new to the table.<br /><br />--It's rarely mentioned, but this movie has one-dimensional, boring antagonists.  We get very little time with any of them, and none of them are memorable.  They're just generic caricatures to be \\"fought against\\" as necessary.  There are standard bad guys that show up all over the place, like those big cartoon hyenas near the midpoint and the giant army near the end.  A few memorable bad guys and some development would have made things a lot more engaging.<br /><br />--That leads us to the action, which has some uninspired choreography.  The flaw of generic bad guys can be partially mitigated when the protagonists break out some awesome maneuvers or strategies.  Very little of this appears in this movie.  We mostly get basic sword swipes, arrow shots, and riding horses directly into swarms of baddies.  You'd think that Helm's Deep would have some traps and attack strategies for whittling the enemy down as they approach the fortress, but such is not the case - thereby wasting an opportunity for some creative attacks.  At one point it seemingly points to Aragorn and Gimli having some kind of plan, but Aragorn just throws Gimli into a swarm of hundreds of baddies.  To be fair, there are a few good moments to be had near the end (e.g., the bomb, the giant ladders, etc.), but that's not saying much when one realizes that thebattle lasts over 30 minutes.<br /><br />--The CGI is exposed more here than in Fellowship, with some particularly cartoonish moments (like the opening sequence, the big hyenas, etc.).<br /><br />--What is it, exactly, that the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie?  Aragorn helps Gandalf cure a king, then he sits around and talks.  It's also ironic that Gandalf is brought back from the dead, then given almost nothing to do.  He spends much of the film off screen as he rides his horse to find reinforcements, a task that almost any other character could have completed.  Meanwhile, the elves sit around and talk, mostly about stuff we already know.  The humans sit around and talk, mostly about fighting but there's no discussion regarding battle strategy other than where they want to fight.  They also walk around and put on armor.  Merry and Pippin talk to a tree that takes forever to form sentences.  I tell you, this movie is very difficult to sit through.<br /><br />--This movie also introduces one of the more unconvincing love triangles in cinematic history.  Aragorn, Arwen, and that other chick.  Why even bother having romance in this movie at all if you're not going to spend time on it, develop it, or make it important?  Aragorn and Arwen have a brief discussion or two, then make-out.  That's it.  Also, Liv Tyler can't act.<br /><br />--One point that is related to Galdalf's contrived resurrection is this:  there are various fake deaths of characters in this movie.  Pippin and Aragorn are given \\"possible deaths\\", but the filmmakers (and/or original novelist) obviously don't want to kill off a main character.  Of course, they do kill a random elf dude in an unwarranted moment of overdramatism.  I'm not sure why I'm supposed to feel sorry for a guy that had a grand total of 30 seconds of screen time before his death.<br /><br />--Also, the wizardry in this film is not creative.  There's not much in terms of spellcasting.

I returned the set and received another one to find that it also had an invalid digital copy.<br /><br />I know that nine times out of ten when I'm going to be watching this movie it's going to be on the blu-ray. However, one of the reasons I wanted the set was so I can watch it during travel. This has been a major disappointment.<br /><br />If the codes are no longer active they need to make that more clear rather than this blatant false advertisement.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|The investigations on this show keep us riveted to our TV. Great writing. I'm glad this one is sticking around for another season.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My nine year old absolutely loves this game.  He could play it for hours.  Of course I have to set my time constraints.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow! I absolutely love Gideon and Eva!! This is my favorite book in the series so far! I cannot wait for the next book!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is very addictive to the kids.  It keeps them occupied when we have to take them along on trips or to run errands.
B0010KG2NS|1.0|The DVD could not be played on my DVD player as it was NOT rated for the US (region1). The product description did NOT mention this, or else I would not have purchased it. The seller stated a no return policy if the package was opened- so how else could I have known this DVD would not play with out opening it?? The DVD is worthless to me.<br />A very frustrating and disappointing experience. It left me wondering if the seller was intentionally deceitful. How many other customers has this happened to? I will not make another purchase through an individual seller on Amazon again.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of those rare shows that relies on real characters with real life stories.  It avoids building stories on the unbelievable and therefore remains hihgly relatable and thought provoking...
B00004XPPE|5.0|Was able to find this movie for a friend- he  remembered seeing this movie as a teenager and really appreciated seeing  again as an adult. Great quality.
B00BESM14U|2.0|By the end, I still couldn't find a plot... only a series of painful unrelated episodes with no real story to tie them all together...

B00992CF6W|5.0|Wasn't sure about buying it or not at first because it was 7 bucks but wow! Worth every dime! Best game ever.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|My husband and I had seen it in the theater , but wanted to watch it again.<br />The extras on the dvd are fascinating. It tells how they did the special effects.<br />A beautiful movie.

B004DLPXAO|2.0|This app would never let me sign in. I didn't have access to th books I had already bought on Amazon. If I could do those two thing, it would be great!!
B004D2A04M|4.0|4 stars and not 3 because the clip that goes on the duty belt is a bit bigger than the standard size duty belt. with this said - it causes some discomfort when moving around and bending over. other than that the clip holds the flashlight snug.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Everyone was talking about Angry Birds, I just didn't get the addiction!! NOW I do! lol Love this game and for anyone reading check out the Angry Birds Star Wars!!! It rocks!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have this on my ipod and on my kindle fire on my ipod they have buckets and spawning eggs and even fire soo ya...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Great soft noise for sleeping.  Love the choices in the app.  Indian flute is really fine.  Can mix sounds well to get to sleep.
B00BB67UNW|5.0|Really a good meeting.  Not expecting such a strong story line.  It wasn't Oscar worthy, however, its a Mark Wahlberg
B0065AVS0K|5.0|Excellent film-it feels like a comic book. Surrealistic and artistic. It is an extremely graphic movie (gorey,in parts), so certainly not for everyone.
B000067QMD|5.0|Bought these with the avent standard breast pump conversion kit so I was able to pump directly into my bottles and not have more pump bottles to clean every day.  I think I'd be pumping for 6 months before I found these, and I wished I'd found them sooner!  These are also just great for portability to make sure your bottles don't spill.  Highly recommend getting these if you use Avent bottles.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|So it would appear that there are a lot of disappointed fans out there.  The chief qualm among them being that the series was not concluded in book 3.  I myself did think that book 3 would be the final one, but contrary to what lots of folks are saying, I say GOOD ON YOU SYLVIA.  Who wrote the rule that a romance must be concluded within three books.  I'm glad this series is continuing, rather than adhering to the norms of other 3 book series.  What I think this reflects is that Sylvia has more to say - certainly her characters have a whole lot more depth.  I'm pleased she didn't compromise the integrity of the story by trying to stitch it up in a limited space.  As long as the story keeps the energy and tempo (and no, I don't just mean those steamy scenes) there is definitely more room to continue the story.  The characters and their are interesting, the book is FABULOUSLY written (finally, someone who can ACTUALLY write well!), and there is enough intrigue to keep the plot rolling along.  And to those that say Ms Day is \\"milking it\\"... Um please reflect on that statement.  Of course she's milking it - who doesn't?  We want her to make lots of money writing novels because she's an awesome (overused word, but apt nonetheless) writer.  Smooth rides make for boaring stories, as we all knew when we started this series because in what realm is a romance ever not melodramatic?  I'm in favour of these characters working a little harder for their happy ending.  So, Ms Day, please, take your (cash) incentives, and keep on a-typing.<br /><br />Often romances get most of their attention for the male characters.  Don't get me wrong, Gideon is intriguing (and still mystifying...), but the show-stealers are Eva, and to a smaller (but no less effective) extent Cary.  I'm so pleased that we finally have a strong female lead.  She's intelligent, confident, funny and sassy but still warm and compassionate, and beautiful but this is never the overwhelming focus.  I almost felt that even when Gideon was telling her how beautiful she is he was also intimating a more multifaceted meaning.  All I can say is, Thanks for a female lead that can hold her own alongside an alpha male, be comfortable with her sexuality and still remain realistically human.  And if there is any doubt in anyone's mind about whether or not to read this book or series, remember that polarisation (in terms of reviews) shows debate, which shows the readers are passionate about the series, and what they expect.  Too few writers can evoke those kinds of reactions from their readers.  And bottomline... the books are well written, and there is no doubt as to quality, even if you disagree about the plot direction.
0425263924|5.0|I love this series and I loved book three and look forward to books 4 and 5. Sylvia you are a brilliant writer!
B001MW0J2E|4.0|The album was new and the music was amazing but the corner was bent in due to carelessness during the shipping.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I love this music,my favorite. This music moves you. If it doesn't there is something wrong with you. I can't get enough of it.
0345529057|5.0|Not a real feel good story. But powerful story telling at it's best. Shipment came on time - I just wish the set had the 5th book.
B00CL6HGIK|1.0|Terrible movie....superfluous coarse language and nudity. Underdeveloped plot. Confusing at times. A lot of the dialogue was hard to hear. Ending was predictable. Excited to see big name actors together, but hated it!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|This was our first time using the Amazon Prime instant videos. I was surprised with the quality of the streaming video. I highly recommend it.
B00CE004XM|5.0|This is one if the best albums I have bought in several years.  Joe's guitar is great as always. Beth's vocals are awesome.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I try not to take books like this too seriously but the Brett plot was downright infuriating. The book was full of \\"filler\\" plots that detracted from what could of been an enjoyable read. Highly disappointed, and yes, I returned it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love the game buy dose it really cost 15$ an hour???????? I like it so addicting but do you really have to pay to play cause I've been playing for hours
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|DEEP PURPLE has had one of the longest, most interesting rides in the history of classic rock and roll, not to mention they have created some of the biggest names in the music industry. `NOW WHAT!?' is the 19th studio record from these British rock legends, and for this latest release, the band has brought on the talents of legendary producer Bob Ezrin (KISS, ALICE COOPER, and PINK FLOYD are just a few of the bands this guy has worked with.)<br /><br />DEEP PURPLE's current lineup (which has stood since 1993) features classic members Ian Gillan (vocals), Roger Glover (bass), and Ian Paice (drums) alongside guitarist Steve Morse (former member of KANSAS and DIXIE DREGS) and keyboardist Don Airey (former member of RAINBOW, WHITESNAKE, and the OZZY OSBOURNE BAND.) Classic keyboardist Jon Lord quit the band in 2002 and passed away in 2012, while classic guitarist Ritchie Blackmore has abandoned the genre of rock and roll and now exclusively plays medieval folk music. This current version of the band has put out some solid studio material, but nothing that reaches the heights of the band's vintage material. How does `NOW WHAT!?' stack up. Is it another \\"good but not great\\" release from the aging band, or something more?<br /><br />It has been 8 years in the making, but `NOW WHAT!?' was definitely worth the wait. I can, in all honesty, say that this is DEEP PURPLE's best album since 1984's reunion LP, `Perfect Strangers.' It is tough to pinpoint the exact sound on this album, but it is a very diverse and strong effort from start to finish, pulling its inspiration from all over in the DEEP PURPLE back catalogue. You get songs that would not be out of place on the band's 70s albums, stuff that would be right at home on their 80s reunion material, and even some modern-ish stuff that recalls `Rapture of the Deep', their most recent prior release. The end result is a record which is diverse but still balanced and even throughout. For me the biggest stand-out of the album is the keyboard playing. It seems like throughout the record, Don Airey is paying tribute to the late Jon Lord, and that is a good thing. It makes this album sound old and new at the same time. Not to mention the rest of the band is at the top of their game as well.<br /><br />DEEP PURPLE's post-80s albums have been a hit and miss affair, but `NOW WHAT!?' rectifies the weaker efforts of recent years, standing as this incarnation of the band's strongest record to date. No die-hard fan of the band should be disappointed with what the group and Bob Ezrin have created here.
B005IDXIL2|3.0|Ok so it's kind of fun to play with a partner but I guess it's just not really fun and I don't think it works cause every time we bowl on it I always get a strike
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I can`t wait to read this book to my middle school students. So many rewarding lessons are taught throughout the pages of this story. I believe this book can change lives.
B0098JJYZQ|4.0|I couldnt decide wheather to give these books 3 or 4 stars. It was a good read a bit slow moving but still worth it. Gabriel was some man in restraint read these books and you'll see why

B0094BB4TW|3.0|I suppose you've got to have a Facebook App to get on Facebook. Maybe I just haven't found the directions yet....but I'd rather the pages opened more like I see them on my computer. Then when i tried to access a fav Facebook game it crashed my web browser. So I'm struggling with this app.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|The book read well, and the information revealed a complicated childhood and young adulthood. The path taken by this young remarkable woman was intriguing and  different. It lead to interesting encounters throughout the book. Also, her dealing with her past was courages. In a way, the process of her coming to peace with her self, was not completely clear. By that I mean, that the description of the transformation process of the main character was not fully evolved. In my opinion something was lacking. The author was very revealing in the book yet, made me feel as if she is maintaining space between her and her readers. Also, the Oprah's book club edition was completely unnecessary as I never read the remarks/comments.<br />Overall a good book, interesting and thought provoking.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Wish I had tried reading books on a Kindle App long ago! For years I've been a book reader, but hesitated to move to electronic books. This is great! A pile of books at your fingertip with no heavy weight of volumes of books that need stored.
B0061QD82E|5.0|The wife and I enjoyed watching this old time treasure from the Disney family while dining on pizza, salad and a cold brew. We would have enjoyed an Italian meal of spaghetti and meatballs but we were fresh out of meatballs.  Any movie put on the screen by the Disney Studios is every bit a treasure for people to own as collector items in this day and age.  Our grand children enjoy receiving these as gifts and they always are reminded that saving the item becomes a very valuable investment.<br /><br />Keep em' coming!~
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use interface and functions well with my new tablet. I am an occasional Ebay vender so I find myself using this App as a seller as well as a buyer. So far everything works perfect for managing listings.
B000FA675C|3.0|I am not sure yet they have not come up yet!!!  I will need time to see what they are doing???
B009EHDU7U|5.0|So brilliantly written that you just keep gathering snippets of life's wisdom. A remarkable ,funny and thoroughly entertaining and educational journey.
B00A757EFW|3.0|It's a great game. My dad downloaded it and beat it the first time  through. I kinda suck at it.=( GREAT CHALLENGE!!!
B001KZG99A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr.!  Need I say more!  Great action that ties in with the rest of the series and more!
B008133MDK|5.0|I can't get enough of this series from the BBC and cannot wait until season three comes out. The chemistry between both the characters as written and played, and between the real life actors really makes it work. Smart acting. Smart adaptations. Smart writing. Smart editing. One of the best TV shows ever! And oh, that Benedict Cumberbatch! I could listen to and look at him for a 24-hour video viewing marathon with no break. Wow! What an actor! What a voice!
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Loved this book! Can't gush enough about my love for this series and Naomi Singh as a writer. Even though the Changeling focused books are the ones I love the most of the books that have gone before I think this one is just as good. It answers some questions that have appeared in the overarching story line and man, The depth of love Kaleb has for Sahara was beautiful and intense to read.
B002RI9ZRC|5.0|Totally agree with the other reviewers who state that this is the best description of the evolution of physics from the basic concept of the atom toward the concept of quantum mechanics.<br /><br />While not a physicist (nowhere close!) I've read a dozen or more books on this fascinating topic, and this is by far the best.<br /><br />It describes the history and personalities of the participants extremely well, follows the trend of the science as each new discovery raises further questions to be explored, and without much need for a 'hard science' background gives the reader a clear view of the the challenges and controversies that moved the field forward.<br /><br />It describes in a very clear and linear fashion the difficult controversies that have been faced and overcome in order to interpret the very strange world of quantum mechanics. It paints a clear and non judgmental account of the differences that two of the book's greatest protagonists...Bohr and Einstein... sparred about in defining this strange new world, and ties in all the other participants ..Heisenberg,Schrodinger, Dirac ,Rutherford, and so many many more in a very logical way as they evolved toward an understanding and interpretation of the quantum world.<br /><br />This is a very accessible account of a very complex topic. The real skill here of the author is that he takes the reader from one stage of understanding to the next, describing how one solution leads to the opening of another question as this mysterious world is explored by great minds and many Nobel prize winners, while at the same time presenting concise and interesting bios of the physicists as they struggle to understand the implications of their theories about the quantum world that still remain difficult to fully comprehend.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. I have a medical background so it was especially fascinating. It really gives one many things to think about. It did strengthen my faith.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|There is so much packed into this book I had trouble keeping track in the beginning, wondering how all the voices and stories would come together. I would request of the author that he label the passages or chapters by voice because sometimes it was confusing for me as to who was narrating. I still can't figure out what happened to one of the characters and how she ultimately was connected. It is a very complex and interwoven story. Stay with it. So worth the tears the flowed freely from my eyes at the end.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|This is an amazing killer album by Megadeth. Reminds me a lot of the Youthansia album. I like the fact that they stretched out on this album and tried some more melodic things. The world isn't built on thrash metal alone you know. Hats off to Dave & the guys for trying something new. Every one wants them to do the same old same old that gets boring. Great metal album. And I love their cover of Thin Lizzy's Cold Sweat. Definatly in my Top 5 for 2013.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Really enjoyable book about selling...yourself and &#34;stuff&#34;...with a dash of HR thrown in.  Its the kind of book you can read on a train and go back to much later and pick up.  Nicely played.
B0088TG252|4.0|It's hard to imagine Denzel Washington as a bad guy that doesn't have a good cause. This is no exception, Plenty of action and well acted.
B00COGY2P2|2.0|I watched this and thought it pretty much sucked. Please tell Tom Cruise he owes me $5.99. I would bet all I have there will be no sequel.
B004GYY714|5.0|By choosing the stations I want for very specific tasks, I get just enough of what I need. Background for reading or browsing. Traffic updates I can access when the need arises.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|my three year old loves this app. we play before her bedtime and it helps relax her with the quiet background music and gentle bubbles. plus the characters interest her.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I consider it a &#34;must have&#34; for any digital device that might hold PDF documents. With a virtual PDF printer on my PC, I can convert virtually anything I do, Word, Excel documents; Webpage or others to PDF and send it to my phone or Kindle. It also limits the recipients ability to change things I prefer remain unchanged.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|great acting, great storyline what more can I say  like I already said its the best series ever  great  great
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I really like this app so now I know not to use my whole battery an  it lets me know
B009GXHOW4|3.0|It worked once, then it didn't work at all for my kindle. I suggest use it on something important that one time
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|This see game is the best. I have a great time playing it. I am so happy that I downloaded it again.
1416955070|5.0|I read the Clockwork series first, and it was so interesting, I started on the mortal Instrument series. I can not get enough of these characters and this story line. Easy to fall into their world and stay there until the book is complete. Clare is a great story teller.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This is one of my favorite episodes of Castle.  I have enjoyed watching it vey much. Thank you for this service.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This record is amazing, maybe it just suits my ear but the songs and sounds on this record are blowing me away. Atmospheric, moody, rocking, and of course that QOTSA swagger. This record has it all, and QOTSA have never sounded better
B000KFB4PK|5.0|This watch is always a conversation starter. &#34;Lego makes watches?&#34;  I have worn lego watches for as long as they have made them. They are comfortable and last just as long as other watches in the under $30  range.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Good acting.  Nice plot.  Time travel movies can be good or bad.  This is one of the good ones.  Buy it.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Rented this movie from amazon. In the 48 hours I had it I watched it at least five times. A must see.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|Found this movie much better (especially the acting) than the 1995 movie of the same name.  Better plot and acting.  Lots of blood and guts but you have to expect that from a Judge.  Highly recommended for action and SF lovers.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I love this game but it doesn't always give me my coins or algea I have coming to me. sometimes when logging in it doesn't have any coins or algea
B009HV2JT8|4.0|A bit far fetched but entertaining story of how vampires were present in the USA and the President's early fight against them before entering politics; and then his fight against vampires who joined the South.  Seems the slave traffic had a lot to do with the need for blood, not labor.  Entertaining.  Not BUFFY but pretty good.
B00BF123WG|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed watching this movie at home, but we liked &#34;Argo&#34; much more. Too much time was spent on the attack of the compound.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Im glad i found, ibe if my fsvorute movies at a very low cost & in great codition. In order to view & share with my own children. With these low prices im sure to be able to complete my disney movie collection.
0553801473|2.0|I finally got through the last book. I've been reading a couple chapters before sleep every night. They've been like mini character portraits. Enjoyable, but most don't seem to have anything do with the other chapters. I feel a little empty, despite the one thousand pages. I've been left hanging--far too many loose ends, and no real climactic finish.<br /><br />There are already some great two-star reviews here that capture how I feel about this book (and the fourth one.) Disappointed, mostly. I began to notice a lot of repetitive prose (\\"must needs,\\" \\"nipples on a breastplate,\\" etc.) and that's a sign to me that the actual story wasn't really holding my interest.<br /><br />Why doesn't George outline his stories better? He could have ended both Feast for Crows and this book on climactic scenes if he had. And trimmed out the bloat. He badly needs an editor.
1742840523|5.0|I had been researching on my own for over a year how movements influence learning.  During my search I had run across reflexes and had been reading as many books that I could fine on the subject.  Just when I thought I had exhausted my search, I found Dr. Blomberg's book, which filled in some of the gaps.  I have since been able to take a couple of courses from Dr. Blomberg and use these methods with my children and students who have learning challenges.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Dang it. I just knew I was done waiting on the end of this story but at the same time, I'm tickled that there will be more.<br />These books are always easy to read and are very entertaining.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have loved every book in the series, including this one. It ties things up nicely while leaving just a few things for the reader to draw their own conclusions on. We knew from the get-go this wouldn't end as a &#34;happily ever after&#34; type story. That's not Sookie's life. It ends with the potential for Sookie to finally have some peace and stability in her life. But what fun would that be?
B00BBW16HW|5.0|The combination of characters makes for numerous scenes that are both funny and touching. This is French humor at its best
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So awesome I can't stop playing.  Come on you should play this game. So awesome#!!!!!!!! Subway suffers! If you like temple run you will like this.
B000MV90B2|4.0|I liked it. I don't critique a film on accuracy, so it may be off, but it was well shot.
B0021L8V1G|3.0|First of all, I order the 2 disc version because I thought it would have a lot of extras.  That was not the case, so It was not worth paying extra.  Iron Man 2 is not as good as Iron Man; I was somewhat disappointed.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I travel a lot for work and bought this backpack to help me carry all my stuff to work and on planes.<br /><br />The laptop pocket keeps my Macbook Pro 15&#34; safe and still; there is a great pocket for my tablet and there is still a ton of room left for everything else. I can fit some clothes in here when needed.<br /><br />This is also the first laptop bag I've ever carried that people ask me about.<br /><br />My only complaint, that isn't bad enough to subtract a star, is that I wish the straps had a little more padding.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Gotta love the old Disney movies. Very good color and sound. They kept it in the original aspect ratio, so it's not full screen. But they do have Disney view which adds cool borders that change through out the movie.
000614182X|5.0|Wow, what a book. This was the first book of a series and less that forty eight hours after finishing it, I started Post Captain (Book 2 of the series). I found Masters and Commanders to be historically accurate, and the detail regarding life in the British navy was presented in a most commendable fashion. The floggings, deprivations, hardships, sacrifice, and feelings of imminent danger were all portrayed so realistically that one could imagine what it must have been like to have been an officer or crew member during the period. Also interesting, was the politics regarding advancement in the Royal Navy Officer Corps and the senior officers pettiness at inhibiting the success of an outstanding Captain. There were a great many leadership lessons to be learned as Captain Aubrey demonstrated his competence in accumulating successes in Battles where he was outgunned and often out maneuvered. This was a brilliant book that offered the detail that was missing from the movie. The ending was perfect and set the stage for successive stories. I am looking forward to completing the series. A great book that is worthy of special praise and merit !
B0061QD7YS|5.0|Always loved this movie when I was a kid, seemed like it was a very well and original story they tried to tell. The pace of the movie is very good. The picture and sound is extremely well done. And also love the fact it has a digital copy of the film as well.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I've read a lot of romance novels but this one was a great twist with the story coming from the man's point of view.  It funny, witty and sexy.... We all want to know what men are thinking. Good to know Emma Chase has an inside track.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|Ok but at times it drags.at times it's as if it freezes were I have to shut it down then go back into it too many times
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Absurd and far fetched and also charming. The book is the story of the unlikely story the the adventures of Alan after he escapes thru the window and the even more unlikely story of his long life. Wholesome and fun.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun but not for long periods of time. It had a few issues that were nothing more than annoying but if you can get past those it is a great game.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|I like the movie it was scarey in the beginning, but then it turn into this fairey tale like<br />scence that i did not care for. Than it was no longer scarey.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I read it in about 2 days and I liked it a lot.  I think Reflected In You is my favorite of the three -- more \\"stuff\\" happened in book 2 and this book seemed to be much more about character development.  I think the various characters' subplots were woven together intricately and intelligently, and of course there was the HEAT of Gideon and Eva -- stronger than ever!  There is a definite opening left for book 4 and I would've liked a little more resolution of some things, but hey -- I'm looking forward to reading more about Gideon and Eva so I'm okay with it.  I reserve my 5 stars for books I simply can't live without, so I'd give EWY 4.5 stars.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My daughter loves to look at the princesses, and the adhesive is amazing - they stick to the wall with no rolling off.

B003008RWA|4.0|Love the information given however as enticing as the health care system in England and France is Michael Moore asked the question about how much does it cost and we never got an answer. I don't feel it showed the whole picture. What if it cost the citizens 50% tax to have all these free services health care and college and dentist. Can a citizen live on the balance of 50% income. Without knowing the cost I don't think a fair assessment is made. I loved the subject matter, it makes you think and question I just felt we needed more.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|My daughter doesn't like to read, but she does like dogs...so that worked out just fine.  It's simple enough to get through in a day or two.  Book review turned in on time.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Very informative, sad and disgraceful to learn how these major corporations control all of the meat we receive. How poor farmers are in debt to the tune of $500K to receive a salary of $18K annually. I don't think there is a job harder than the farmers of America. The control the corporations have over the farmers is disgraceful. What happened to the land of the FREE. I can tell you I will now be looking to purchase my meats elsewhere from small farmers that don't use antibiotics or<br />hormone growth drugs. To see a chicken house filled with 5 Ib. chickens that can't walk, they can take 3 steps and have to stop because they are pumped up with growth hormones and grow to fast their bones can't hold the weight. To see some just lying around because they can't move and this is what we eat. 4 major corporations have a monopoly on all the foods we eat, look them up I'm no longer buying from them, my kids grew up with Tyson chicken, Smithfield, Perdue. Our Presidents and Congress all received huge donations to their campaign fund....why so the votes in the Senate can go their way. Our Senators retired taking CEO jobs for these big Corporations, when are we going to wake up and stop being so complacent. To make a change in the world you have to be the CHANGE!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Bought the first and second seasons together as a gift for a family member.  She enjoys the show and will get all future seasons as well when they come out.  Great gift.
1400069289|4.0|Enjoyed this very much --interesting stories, relevant research, well articulated application. I learned one particular concept about habit formation that I have actually remembered and recalled in daily life. I think that's great.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a great beginning to the other two books in the series.  It was a page turner.  I highly recommend it and hope there is more to come.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I agree with almost everything else that has been already said.  Yes, the ending sucked and she's splitting it even more to get eek every penny out of this \\"trilogy\\".  Shame on her.  Even worse, I felt that the there wasn't a story line.  What was the point of the book?  Tons of drama, but for what purpose.  A lot of character development for little purpose. I just didn't get it.  I'm inclined to not buy the rest of the books.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Awesome! I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! Full of action! Good family movie! My kids are hooked! Can't wait for the next movie!

B001GH5GDC|5.0|Cosmos Factory is the single best example of why 40+ year down the road John Fogarty is the most iconic rock and roll songwriter America has ever produced.  Whether it's the top ten hits or Classic rock staple, Cosmos Factory brings together the music that made the CCR timeless.
B008KEQMDC|3.0|It was a cute movie, I liked how everyone's stories kind of tied into eachothers. I thought It was going to be more of a tear jerker, but maybe I wasn't as emotional about it because I don't have children of my own.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Almost put this book down (too much husband/wife dialog)  Same old issues, then I talked with a friend who told me to hang in there.  So I did, and liked the fast paced and the unexpected ending.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book--I couldn't put it down.  The characters were well-developed.  You literally felt like you were inside the main character's (Pat Peoples) head.  The chapters written in &#34;montage style&#34; and letter style were brilliant.  I saw the movie (which I really liked) before I read the book.  I have to say I'm glad it was in that order, because I think I would have been disappointed in the movie if I had read the book first.  There was a lot of adaption in the movie from the book, which was probably necessary, because it would have been impossible to develop the characters.  I recommend this book highly!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It's one of those series you can't get enough of. I found myself looking early in each season to see if the next season had been purchased & scheduled for shooting. Only problem with series like this one is no matter how many seasons they run....they really can't end with closure.....they just have to stop mid-stream, somewhere, leaving most fans wanting more. Fringe science has always intrigued me.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a very good app as  advertised  it seems to be better than most other battery management apps that I've seen.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Engaging account of the author's physical and spiritual journey due to a life-threatening illness. I applaud his descriptions of Near Death Experience and the subsequent struggle to reduce and explain it in purely scientific terms. Truly eye-opening conclusions that makes one question the reality of reality.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's kind of hard to not like minecraft, but this game is ridiculous. If you want a better game just spend two dollars and get block story. Since there are no caves, no anything pretty much, its just like minecraft when it came out. STILL.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Saw this with my dad and brother in theaters and couldn't wait to order it on blue ray, And I've watched it 5 times since then. I love the sci-fi future world the writer creates.<br /><br />Also JGL and BW are quite good in this.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Angel...<br />Ace...<br />Crossfire...<br />I'm honestly NOT disappointed that there will be more to Gideon & Eva's story... I can see there is so much more to explore with them!<br />I hope the wait isn't too long - although I won't be upset to have to re-read Bared to you, Reflected in you and then Entwined again... its just that good :)
0425263924|2.0|Like most of the readers I anxiously awaited this book.  I pre-ordered for my kindle.  I read it in one day.  By half way in I realized the author was going to leave us hanging.  I could care less about the peripheral characters.  Eva's and Gideon's relationship did not grow stronger, they just had great sex the whole book.  I am all for great sex but I would have actually liked to have seen some romance.  At no point in this book did I feel that I knew Eva and Gideon any better than I did after book 2.  I am very disappointed and I will not be able to sit through book 4 and 5.  As far as I am concerned Eva and Gideon lived happly ever-after, THE END.

B00BQ1DBUS|3.0|If this is rock'n Rod? more like Rod rocks Vegas-style. there is not a whole lot to rock to here. certainly no sign of anything bluesy or hard. major disappointment and won't be part of my rotation.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|I finally got around to watching this movie and was blown away so I came back and changed my rating to five star.  Without doubt this is one of the best movie to date.  More than just a fairytale. Consider this movie a gift to grownups who grew up with Jack and the beanstalk.  Now you have your own fairytale.
B007V65R54|3.0|USEFUL INFO, Will make you a better thinker if you pay attention to what the author says. Be aware of your bias

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I love Gideon but this book was just SEX, SEX, and more SEX! Ugh! No story at all, just a waste! I was hoping for more development of their relationship but it always came down to sex except the 10 pages that finally showed some happiness for Eva and Gideon, then I was thrown off again by some nonsense! FRUSTRATING!!! Not worth $9.99, I waited  so long to read this book and I even followed Sylvia Day on facebook. All this time I thought it was a trilogy, only after this book was released did she post on Facebook saying there is going to be a book 4 and 5. WTH? She could have mentioned that earlier. I was hoping for an ending to their story which is why I pre ordered the book! I'M FILING FOR A REFUND!!! I've read better $2.99/$3.99 kindle books. THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH IT! BORROW IT FROM YOUR LIBRARY OR A FRIEND. Trust me, it's not worth rushing to read.  I'm going to unfollow Sylvia on fb and wait til book 5 is out at the library, I'm not even going to waste time on book 4, what's the point? It'll just be another filler.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I feel like I was double CROSSed!  Very disappointed to lean that this trilogy is now part of a five-book set.  Talk about being caught in the CROSS-hairs of greed!  It's  too bad because I really enjoyed their story.  Unfortunately, I won't be purchasing the remaining books.  I'm not convinced that there will only be two more and at this price it's definitely NOT worth the money.... Sorry Sylvia, I'm CROSSing you off my must read list and returning the books since it's not the trilogy it was billed to be!
B004LWZW42|4.0|We all enjoyed watching this film in the x men series.it came on time and in good condition. we have seen the whole series.

0143119680|5.0|For those of us who have read and reread the first two of Deborah Harkness' All Souls Trilogy novels, I am guessing that like me, you yearn for the third in the series and check her website often. But that kind of quality cannot be rushed so we wait and some of us reread them. These novels are packed with details and character depth that they warrant rereading. I hardly ever reread a book no matter how good the book, nor how bored I am. But there are always exceptions to the rules and I do love those exceptions. Even if you do not like novels with witches and other creatures, even if you would never read Tolkien's books or Harry Potter or anything with magic in it, make an exception and read these. She has an amazing understanding of people (for what does it really matter if a character in a book is somewhat different as her characters are; we are all different in some manner). And she has a way of finding the healthy and loving solutions we would all like in our lives and rarely find in our reading. Deborah Harkness has created a world within our world which is intricate, and exciting; with in-depth characters you love and those you do not; but all of them are believable. As you read you will find that the species of her characters is much less import than their ability to love even when it is difficult and to face their fears and desires.<br />If you have ever found yourself less than happy with who are, if you have ever known great joy or fear or deep sorrow, if you struggle to master yourself or have problems loving yourself or trusting others, you will find the same struggles within the novels' characters and even better: the hope and joy we all want. In fact, Harkness writes so well that they are more than characters; you may find yourself or friends within her pages.<br />I enjoy historical novels with some mystery within them. There are many authors I can recommend but none do as wonderful a job. Deborah Harkness is an historian and a very, very gifted writer. No wonder she needed to branch out into novels. While I liked historical settings, until these books, I never realized what wealth history can add. These books are not just set in an historical time, they involve real people who she threads through her stories; albeit she takes some artistic license with a few of them yet still gives us something believable. Her approach makes it all the more enjoyable.<br />She writes so well that I actually bought one of her history books. History can be fun if told by an excellent storyteller and Deborah Harkness is that. I should know for I am a story teller and a poet and very difficult to please.<br />\\"It began with absence and desire, it began with blood and fear, it began with The Discovery of Witches\\", which is the title of the first book. Long ago, I wrote poems about the same forces in life for desire, blood and fear are central concerns no matter what else comes our way.<br />Oh and few more notes: aside from her first novel debuting at #2 on the New York Times Best Seller list, being named one of the best books of February 2011 by Amazon, and selling in at least 34 countries another tidbit which may interest you is that  Warner Bros bought the movie right and hired David Auburn (Lake House) to adapt the stories. And you can bet those of us who have loved her novels are anxiously awaiting the first movie. Check out You Tube for more on that.
B009JBZH54|5.0|hard cover box, being 3-in-1 make my space for storing even better.  love the packaging.  Too bad digital copy not valid for Australia.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is perfect. It contains directions in plain language. The only things I am left wonderring about are what if anything they add to the uploaded cover image and if MS Publisher is also a good software. But do not worry directions use WORD.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointed in the alleged conclusion to the Crossfire 'trilogy'. Story lines came out of nowhere at the end of the book one after another. The book had me interested for awhile but I really don't know if I will read books 4 and 5 now. Should have concluded with this one.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Heartthrob is so catchy, I can't stop listening to it on continuous loop. There are really no weak tracks on this album.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|I think this is stupid. It is so boring. THIS GAME IS HARD AND IT FEELS LIKE YOU BEEN PLAYING FOR HOURS. JUST BE GLAD ITS FREE CAUSE IF NOT THAN IT NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. JUST SAYING.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I should recommend this to anyone, I have read a lot of science fiction and this is some of the best. I also recommend you read these others.<br /><br />Asimov Foundation Series<br />Heinlein Starship Troopers<br />Nick Cole Old Man and the Wasteland
B009R659L8|5.0|She's done it again.  I've read every book by Mary Higgins Clark, found her by accident in the library years ago, now I find myself just waiting for her next book to come to be announced so I can pre-order!  This one didn't dissapoint!  WOW!
B004HO6HWA|5.0|Jason Statham and Donald Sutherland are simply awesome in this remake of the classic Steve Macqueen  thriller. I highly recommend it.

030758836X|2.0|On the morning of their 5 year anniversary Amy disappears.  Nick doesn't react quite right, he's worried but he's hiding something (we find this out in the first few pages).  As the investigation into Amy's disappearance continues we find out why Nick is behaving 'odd', still he is a good guy.  Every other chapter is an extract from Amy's diary, starting from the moment they met.  They are such a lovely couple.  Only soon the tone of Amy's diary changes. This, the beginning of this book, perhaps the first 1/3 was amazing, 5 stars - so clever jumping between the stories, filling in the gaps and I thought it was well written.<br /><br />This will contain massive SPOILER.<br /><br />To me it was quite clear that it was only a few ways the book could go.<br />1) Nick killed Amy<br />2) Someone else killed/kidnappend Amy<br />3) Amy faked her own disappearance/murder<br /><br />I would have been disappointed with 1, I strongly suspected 3 but I was hoping it was going to be number 2 and it would continue in the same clever way it had started. Sadly it was number 3.<br /><br />Amy is a full blown sociopath who have spent almost a year getting everything ready to get Nick convicted of her murder.  For me everything goes downhill from there in the book.  Everything was so 'perfect' (read unrealistic) in Amy's plan but yet Nick knows Amy well enough to know what to say to tempt her home. It was utterly predictable and both the characters are filled with hate. And it just doesn't finish with her coming home, she creates an another clever trap to keep Nick with her, a baby.  It just couldn't wait for it to be over with and the ending was even more dreadful than expected.  Just awful...
B006LSZECO|5.0|It kept me guessing and just when I thought I was right it took a twist. Couldn't put it down and have recommended it to many.
B008220BLG|4.0|Warm Bodies was better than I expected it to be.  My husband thought it was ridiculous, but it is a fairly chick-flickish approach to a zombie tale so I suppose his opinion is understandable.  Lighthearted, humorous zombie romance is the best way I can think of to describe this movie.  Interesting premise, well acted, worth seeing in my opinion.
B00BESIKWM|5.0|No Blood and guts like a lot of the SHOCK type horror films out today.  More of a throwback in terms of just creepy s*** going on.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Not was i expecting or wanting from the Homme/Grohl combo.  I Thought Dave would heavy Queens up on this record... I'm so glad they werent asking me for advice!  One of the best albums i've ever heard.  Every song is epic!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have been impressed with all of Mr.Hosseini's novels but I would have to say his skill in crafting this story is amazing.  His writing is truly like poetry.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Some of the most annoying cast I have ever scene. I didn't find much humor in it and only got about half way through before I turned it off.  Not worth the money to rent.  Just bad.
B00A5FPQBI|4.0|A shoot 'em up, get rich by any means necessary movie.  Pretty raw but straight to the point and the music alone was worth it.

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I'm sure that is epic. The Best WOW game ever since the God who are not allowed to die.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am really, really pissed off.  I remember like yesterday that after I read the first 2 books I pre-ordered the third and FINAL installment of the series, I went on vacation and it was my plan to read the book on december 31st 2012.  The publishing company postponed the publication at least 4 times.  Finally, tuesday morning the books is available.  I just finished it and it's a great book but its also a RIP OFF.... $30 dollars later and STILL I DON'T KNOW HOW THE BOOK ENDS.  I guess the author expect me to spend another $9.99 in 6 months to read the final installment (if so)  $40 DOLLARS FOR AN EROTIC NOVEL????  I paid $29.99 for fifty shades of gray and that series was better.  RIP OFF.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Making my Kindle a three dollar alarm clock seems silly but this ap is useful; flexible and well worth the cost.  I use it daily.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book! I read some of the reviews and was shocked how others could gather those opinions. Yes, I agree some of the story stretched a bit. I didn't care about Megami and hated that Eva wanted to be friends with Brett but it didn't change how I love the story of Eva and Gideon. We saw trust build in this book between them. I know we are going to see them become a powerful force together in business and in their marriage. I can't wait for everyone to learn they are married!
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|This is a real brain teaser.  It's challenging and thoughtful and what I like is it forces you to think in different ways.  I hope to be using this game well into my (ahem) senior years!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Takes a long time to accomplish simple production, unless you actually buy in game credits. Not cheap if you really want to compete with others online.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Heartbreakingly beautiful. A story rich in characters,family love lost and history. The descriptions of life in Afganistan is heartbreaking .
B009O2XY12|5.0|my kids and i love it we cant get enough of it. We look forward to playing again when it energizes
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was good and very romantic. I really enjoyed reading it. it shows that real love may still exist if you fight for it.
B00BIRRDZ4|5.0|With each new album, with each new song, Dawes improves on what I thought couldn't be improved upon. Alt rockers with heart! Keep it coming!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This film was better than I thought it was going to be. There was a good quantity of action that was paired with comedy making the film interesting without being too serious. Also, there was a small love story on the side which makes it practically a good movie to watch for people interested in action, romance, and comedy. Overall, it was a good film and is worth the money to rent.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has a wonderful ability to describe life, tell a story and bring you through an adventure. I am ready for the next book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It was a fantastic perfectly good adventure I enjoyed it I got addicted for two whole months I will highly recommend to my friends
1781162646|1.0|I have been a Stephen King fan for over 30 years and it breaks my heart to give one of his books a bad review, but that's what I have to do. I was so disappointed in Joyland!  If someone had given me this book to read and asked me to guess who the author was, I would never have said Stephen King. I would have guessed a first-time writer, not an old pro like King. The \\"ghost\\" aspect of the story is mostly non-existent and I felt like it was thrown in there to justify having some cool cover art. This is really just a coming-of-age story about a 21-year-old man. It's not a Stephen King book!  I feel very let down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kindle fire HD  won't let me update minecraft.But the game is awesome but I think that it should come automatically.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I really don't care for the new setup on Yahoo.  We all had to go to it, but received no instructions.  Also, it allows too much spam.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|I can go into my settings any time to check my battery. Why bother with this app? It looks good, says my battery is good, but as far as I'm concerned is worthless if not on my task bar.  Tempted to give it one star.
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Let me start by saying that it is unbelievable how people get mad when you dislike something others like (or vice-versa) whether it be music, movies or other forms of art. People have a right to express their opinion. So here's mine: This release it utter garbage. There is some good guitar playing here but this one aspect or part does not justify the whole. The lyrics are 90 plus percent juvenile, boring, and uneventful. Mustaine sounds like he's just going through the motions here. There's simply no passion, enthusiasm in the message or cohesiveness to the songs (with the exception of the Thin Lizzy cover Cold Sweat).  In addition, the bass and drums lack resonance as well. Disappointing for a band that has through Endgame and half of 13 been solid in this regard. So in essence, poor songwriting, lack of punch or resonance in all aspects except solos/riffs which is not enough to carry this release or make it worthwhile to purchase. This is a purchase I very much regret making. My advice is to listen to a copy a friend has and them make the decision if you really want to add this to your collection.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Interesting twist on old tales and bringing them into real life.  Keeps you guessing on how it is going to play out.  Switching back and forth between the story world and real world keeps it interesting.  My kids (15 and 12) locked themselves up for hours at a time watching this (in between homework) because they could not wait to see what wascoming next
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A fascinating read, truly original.  I look forward to more from Hugh Howey.  Lets hear it for writers unencumbered by editorial BS.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I had heard a bit about this movie as we had seen and discussed Fireproof with a weekly small group.  We were invited to relax in the padded pews of an unfamiliar church and watch Courageous on their big screen tv.  I found myself weeping and my husband even teared up. Why wasn't their kleenex anywhere?<br /><br />Im planning to show it to families at my church - its that impactful.  If you do the same or just want to rent it for the evening I suggest having dads in attendance.  Watching it without them is fine (its message can easily can be transferred to moms).  However, if you try to verbally give the synopsis to dads, it may not be as impactful.
B000XR4OC0|2.0|5 months ago I bought a pair of Toms for my 15 year old daughter because \\"that's what all the other girls are wearing\\".  She loves them, says they are incredibly comfortable and wants another pair; because the ones I bought have already worn out!  $50.00 for shoes that didn't last 6 months is just too much!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is an all-time classic.  I think I enjoy it more every time I watch it, if that is possible.  If you haven't seen it or don't own a copy, buy one and see what all the buzz is about.  Christopher Plummer, Julie Andrews, and Eleanor Parker (as well as all the actors and actresses who make up the children) are phenomenal in this movie.
0425263991|5.0|This novel was the most anticipated book on my TBR list this year - even more than the BDB, Midnight Breed, Dark Hunter and The League series. Heart of Obsidian is an amazing novel and ties up clues that have been sprinkled throughout the series. Nalini did a superb job in building the Psy-Changeling-Human world such that there is continuity with the timeline and facts between all of the novels (unlike many series that I love).<br /><br />As I was reading Heart of Obsidian, I dragged out the earlier novels and checked out the clues. This novel answered so many questions about the Ghost, the break-down of Silence, people that were referenced in passing, NetMind and DarkMind. (Yes, there are still some unanswered questions). I was truly sad when the book ended as I could have read a couple of hundred more pages.<br /><br />I wished I was able to see more of the Psy, Changelings and humans that were the main characters in the other novels BUT Heart of Obsidian is a love story set in the backdrop of the upheaval in a world that is at war. I loved that the focus was on the hero and heroine and how love and acceptance is at the very heart of their relationship along with the ability to grow within that relationship.<br /><br />I am so looking forward to the next novels as the ending of HoO has a new world emerging from the rubble of the old world. I am going to reread this novel and then will go back to Slave to Sensation to begin looking at this series with fresh eyes. I wish I can give this book more than 5 stars as the writing, plot and characters stand heads above most of the books that I have read in the last year. Great job, Nalini, and now I get to look forward to Guild Hunter in the fall once I finish my re-read of this series.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Never heard of them and here they were getting a review on WNPR...they played a couple of selections and I found them to be most enjoyable....they even have a selection sung by Paul Williams, another one of my old favorites.  I mean, it must be good if Paul Williams thinks so.  In my eyes he's a bit of a musical genius!  Got the CD and I LOVE IT.  I play it over and over!  Haven't heard disco beats in years and every song seems to be interesting.  Like I said, I love it!
B00BC24NT4|2.0|I swear I thought there was something wrong with my kindle when suddenly this book ended as if LeCarre just decided he got tired of writing.<br />Now, The Sopranos ended the same way, but, it ran for 5 years and you sort of got on board with the idea of &#34;an ending without an ending&#34;.<br />In this case, however, it was more like a cliffhanger.<br /><br />Unless he has a sequel for this book, I'm gong with two stars.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|I've been a fan of Diana Krall before she became famous and have almost all her CD's and have seen her in concert five times including the Glad Rag Doll concert.  The Glad Rad Doll CD is a forgettable album except for 4-5 songs.  I feel Diana should stick to her best and most popular work, that being jazz standards.  There are so many songs in the Great American Songbook just waiting for her sultry jazz style.  I'll wait until then to buy her next CD or see one of her concerts.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Tom Cruise portrayed Reacher's personality and attitued well. The movie was lacking in the details compaired to the book. I would watch the movie again and maybe see something I missed the first time.
0345803507|5.0|I just love these books.... have read all 3 of them 3 times........ Its about time to read again. Laters baby!!
B004P8A7J2|5.0|Jared is amazing!  I am hoping to add this movie to my collection of movies permanently!  I love JARED LETO!
0374533571|5.0|Loved this book! I couldn't put it down. I started reading it in the afternoon, and didn't move other than to turn the pages until I'd finished the book.<br /><br />It's a well written story. Having several friends with mental illnesses I found it interesting to be inside Pat's head and be privy to the things he thought, and his delusions. Tiffany makes for an interesting character as well, and the interactions between Pat and his father are engaging to read.<br /><br />It had a nice ending, though a little predictable.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book with one caveat: don't watch the movie after! It is a totally different story.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abby has added one more thing I can share with my wife. Rarely do we both focus so intently on a program, and not have our laptops up and running.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for making Downton Abby available to us<br /><br />Paul + Linda
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I've liked Hosseini's previous two novels, but this one was hard to follow. It is told from several points of view and I had trouble figuring out which person was 'speaking'. It would have been helpful if the person whose point of view was being tolds name was at the beginning of each chapter, or the book was organized a differently where each person had there own section. It is told in a chronological order, changing view points as time progresses. I almost wish that I had kept notes of characters so I could have followed the story better. Despite that, I will likely read his next book when it comes out.
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|Game is stable, easy to use. Not my favorite but when you are waiting for something is a good time killer.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is such a fun movie. Story line is a little lame and predictable, but it was pretty funny and the music was good. I liked that cast of characters and how they interacted. Can't wait for the sequel.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|Loved watching the ones Id seen again and catching up om the episodes I missed! Love Love Love! This Show wish there were more
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Kiera Cass has done it again. The Elite was just as good as the Selection and the Prince (novella). I read it in one setting just as I did her other books. In this book the story of the Selection is continued, the love triangle getting more complex. Should she fall for the prince, or choose her childhood sweetheart? In a subplot the government is falling apart and the rebels keep attacking the compound and stealing books. Why are they stealing books? What are they looking for? Perhaps they are looking for the real history and not the one fabricated by the royal family.<br /><br />Kiera, write quickly, I can't wait for the next book in this series!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|shame on me!! i bought this book even after reading the review just for lojalty to the series. i really didnt care that there is a book four  as long as she delivered a good product. im a fan of a good read, and i like to make my own opinion. my opinion is the book was lame, at this point of the series there should be something more that kept me entreteined, i read the entired book looking for it and then it was over with a silly note (by the way wtf was that? ending with a note, really?)<br /><br /> i read the review about the ending note before bying the book, but i did not realise how insulting the note was. i fell played. but again  i was hoping for a good book. the last two books were really great. make me think what happened to her writing on this one?  i guess i will return this book with all the other customers. Ms. Day im not satisfy with your work. please fire your editor and email me when your writing genius is working again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I saw the movie the Hunger Games, it took me half of the reel to &#34;get it&#34;.  Then I went home and downloaded it on my kindle.  The is a metaphorical expression about how the younger generation sees us, the older generation today.  And it is a bit terrifying if you take it very seriously..sacrificing our children in the name of competition, having cocktail parties in an unbelievably huge arena as the children kill themselves in action (scenario familiar?)..Dressing up to the point of looking like a clown in the name of glamour..Suzanne Collins has it right and it is startling.  Have not read the other parts of the trilogy..prefer biographies..but this book is an eye opener!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I haven't had this much fun in ages. I can't wait for more! I hope the sequel is released soon. I'm sure you will enjoy this game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book and have already recommended to friends.  If you have a young teenage boy you may want to ponder a bit before reading.  I found some of it mildly disturbing.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Excellent love story.  Yes, there are sad parts to it, but hey--that's life isn't it?  Warning, it will probably make you at least tear up.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I cannot get myself off this app. It's that good. If you're one of those people who has stuff to do, this app may not be the best thing for you. But if you're like me and have lots of time to waste, it's perfect for you. And it has EVERYTHING from crafts to makeup to food to art to clothing. And it shows really cool DIY if you're really creative, unlike me. 5/5
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't usually read Stephen King, but I really love this book, pulls you in from the beginning and never lets go.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|My rating is three stars because I played fir a while and it just got really old nothing interesting Happen  just the same stuff over and over again
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I really do love the show. I just notice that it's more about egos and relationships than it is about zombies. I'm just admitting that as an adult male... I am watching a soap opera. It's okay, cuz it's a zombie soap opera. But... it's a soap opera.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|This show appeals to wide age range - it kept our 3 yr old granddaughter transfixed. It's a richly choreographed and highly acrobatic production.
0765325950|5.0|This was the finish for a series that I have been reading for a long time.  It finished the story well, but I hated to see it end.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Pretty good movie This movie had me laughing the entire time and buy the way it came on time ready to enjoy
B004KD5TQI|4.0|I got it for the songs played during the action sequences during the movie. I found myself really enjoying Emily Browning's remakes of &#34;Sweet Dreams&#34; and &#34;Asleep&#34;.<br /><br />She pretty cute, too.<br />Hmmmm, Emily Browning... Arrrggghhh....
B004529NKC|5.0|i like a lot i love romance love that it show between two people when they are on different side
B000002HPV|5.0|Oh, yeah... It was years ago. Someone stole my original copy. It happens, a lot! I'm still trying to figure out who stole my copy of TLC's &#34;Crazy Sexy Cool&#34; because that's not an album I feel worth buying twice.<br /><br />Anywayz...<br />I LOVE this album.<br />Bjork does no wrong, in my book.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|i have step up 1 and 4 so i thought why not get two three and all the step up movies are some of my favoite dance movie cause i like to dance some times

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I got this app for my children and they like it.  I don't know too much more than that because I'm not exactly staring over their shoulders watching them play.
1423136802|4.0|Good condition.  Just as described. My granddaughter was pleased and is sharing it with her friend.<br />Always satisfied with the items I receive.
B009JZPH32|1.0|You guys made me pay for this movie as if it were an actual movie I could own, I can't downland it, even when it said you could it was for that lame kindle garbage, I have to have wifi in order to watch it and can only access it through your site. Might as well call it rentals or an expensive netflix. Would have just bought the dvd, why in the world would I pay dvd price for something I can't own.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Very cool gameplay, with an imaginative and unique puzzle premise. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I'd recommend this for anyone. The puzzles always look deceptively simple, but if you keep in mind the rules of the game, you'll see it's not as easy as it looks.
B001NLL93W|2.0|This was 4 stars until the end. Clary: \\"I need to make a wish from an angel who can pretty much do ANYTHING. I know! I'll wish for ONE PERSON WHO I THINK IS SEXY TO COME BACK FROM THE DEAD. What about the 9 year old brother of my closest friends? Nah, he's not a big deal. How about bringing back all the Shadowhunters that died in the fight? Nope. How about just wishing for world peace, because you can do that? NOPE.<br /><br />But Jace is so darn sexy, I don't give a second thought about all the kids and old people and Shadowhunters that died. It's okay, because he's a sexy half angel guy that makes my heart flutter.\\"<br /><br />Yeah. That right there kind of brought it down for me. Everything else: Pretty decent. I like Magnus and Isabelle and Luke and pretty much all the side characters way more than I like little miss prissy pants, I can draw pretty things that I don't even come up with by myself I-do-whatever-the-heck-I-want-then-act-surprised-when-people-call-me-childish Clary and I'm-so-emo-and-sexy-and-totally-not-on-my-period Jace.<br /><br />The minor characters are way better. And I cared more to see what happened to them than the main couple.<br /><br />Also, the whole twisty that was sprung on us about Sebastian was pretty darn predictable. Just sayin'. Saw the lake thing coming, saw the Sebastian thing coming, saw Clary's wish coming from a mile away.<br /><br />All that being said, I did actually like it enough to continue the series.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|It works just fine for charging my Kindle and is a necessary tool when you own one. Could not use it without having one.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I thought the idea of love as a sickness that could be cured was so clever because we all know love can make us do crazy things.  I loved how it ended.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|The premise of the story was intriguing which gave it depth. The movie wasn't grab your seat scary but it did have a few moments here and there. It's worth a watch for a filler movie.<br />I gage things on if I would watch it in the movies, buy the dvd or rent it. This one falls in the rental on a raining day category.
B00005JPTK|4.0|I love movies staring Will Smith, with the exception of Wild West and Ali. Good plot and good storyline. If you've not seen it, it's worth the time to see it.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I originally purchased this movie because of the content dealing with the Philadelphia Eagles.  I enjoyed the movie and all parts of it, especially the lovely Jennifer Lawrence, who made me wish I was in my early 20's again.
0385736002|5.0|I love this series of books. I had a hardback copy, but lost it in a flood a couple years ago. I couldn't find another hardback copy, but this will do as a replacement. Scott hit a home run with this series. Even though it is young adult, it is very entertaining and keeps the reader engaged. I would recommend the entire series.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I love my sonic screwdriver! It's a perfect replica of ten's, and David Tennant being my favorite Doctor, it's perfect. It's a great item for cosplay or even just treasure for ever on your doctor who shrine. Only issue was it was a little confusing on how to place the batteries inside of it, but didn't take longer than five or so minutes. Amusingly, a screwdriver is required to assemble.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|This is the first of his Century of Giants trilogy and is a well researched epic novel. Follett's skill is to educate the public about history in an enjoyable way by involving human interest. The novel tells the story of the events leading up to and during World War I through the eyes of characters and their families in England, Russia, Germany and America. This war saw the fall of aristocratic rule right across Europe and Follett paints a vivid picture of the contrasting lifestyles of the rich and powerful as opposed to the poor and undertrodden. One is immersed in the futility of this terrible war, of the chaos on the battlefield and the lack of strong leadership, of the senseless inertia as each side tries to hold or gain territory, often just a few hundred metres. One always assumes that when an armistice is signed, the war is over. Not this one however and Follett skilfully describes the secret aftermath of this war and the deceit of politicians that continues up to the present day in our current conflicts.
0425263924|5.0|Totally forgot a ordered till it came in the mail the other day! Loved it just like the other two! Can't wait for the next one!
B00BLGDFH2|4.0|When you have this many artists collaborating on an album, there's bound to be variation between the songs.  That is both a pro and a con to this album.  Some of the songs are very memorable, and I can definitely rock out to them on an almost daily basis.  Others, not so much.  In fact, some of the songs just didn't do anything for me, so I just skip over them when I listen to the album.<br /><br />I recommend 6 out of the 11 songs, so....since that's a majority of the songs....I'll go ahead and recommend the whole album.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series! Sylvia , once again you wrote an amazing story!  I've waited for this book for months and months and  like always, you didn't disappoint!  I'll be waiting impatiently for book 4... :)
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I didn't like MIB 3 as well as the first and second movies, but I still enjoyed it. I don't watch many sci-fi movies but I really enjoy all the weird aliens in these movies. There weren't as many in this third movie and Tommy Lee Jones wasn't in it much...however, his &#34;younger self&#34; did a terrific job. I also liked the twist at the end that shows a very early connection between &#34;K&#34; and &#34;J&#34;.  The MIB movies are movies I watch more than once and I'll be watching this one again as well as its predecessors.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I like the hero being a woman, great energy and effort on the part of the hero,  always with the life and death situations.
1934030198|5.0|If your looking for the latest fad training regimen or quick fix training solution don't buy this book as you will be disappointed to learn there is no magic formula that will transform you to triathlete overnight.  This book contains excellent information on how to become a better trained triathlete, or if you fairly new to multi-sport competition like me, it provides a rock solid platform in which to build from.  The techniques and training advice that Friel promote are proven to be effective all the way to the top of the sport.  My biggest take away from this book was zone training , building a strong endurance base by staying within a specific heart rate zone based on the goal of the workout.  I always thought if you want to be fast you need to train at a fast pace, not the case at all and this book tells you how to do it right.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's a great game but don't use all u stuff off the bat save them to get the better armor and score later on in the game.
B00632HWOG|5.0|My home phone is set up to send me an email whenever I have new voicemail. There are some places I visit frequently that don't have cell service, but wifi is available. Using the Yahoo! Mail app on my Kindle Fire, I can check for voicemail without calling my home phone number. I can even listen to the vmail right in email. I highly recommend this app.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this in one sitting. Great story and even greater characters. This story really sheds a much needed light on the world of mental health.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|What can I say about it?  It's Star Trek and thus I love it. I am just trying to collect all 5 shows.
B004UID2LC|2.0|It doesn't work like the regular one on the computer. You can't search for something, play several versions, etc, without downloading every song. Too time consuming.
B00881VLCE|2.0|it is super fun but it keeps closing like it will let me open it and play it once after I download it but after that if will not let me open it again but it is super fun the first time
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I can't use The Weather Channel app because every time I do, it says, &#34;The Weather Channel has stopped. Boo. I have to look up The Weather Channel every time I want to look at the radar.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Does what I expected it to do. Easy setup. The fact that it is free is a definite bonus, as I am not interested in one more unsolicited ad.
B003SI605K|5.0|Once a year you can find me huddled on the couch with some chinese food and the Joy Luck Club. It never gets old. Classic.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I played the free version and liked it enough to spend money on it. Full version died before it even got to where I was on the free version. Tried removing from device, downloading again. Now it will not even install after down load. A lot hassle for a useless, pricey game that would really be fun if it worked!
B000JIN3J8|4.0|Pride and Prejudice  presented in a classic style.  A low key, less theatrical version introduced with fanciful drawings and music.  It conveys a calm almost serene atmosphere which colors the story in lovely pastels.  The characters are true to the book which is very important.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Although I was not surprised at the many differences in the book and movie, I was surprised that the main character was different in the book.  I loved the movie, but will keep the book on my Kindle for years to come.  I'd recommend this book to anyone.  Fanny is the greatest writer.
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|QA took a LOA during the production of this DVD.  It plays, but almost none of the controls, e.g. &#34;Top Menu&#34; or &#34;Menu&#34;, work as they should, so once you've played the 1st and/or 2nd episode you can never get back to them.  You cannot access a list of the episodes at all.  Even if you reject and reinsert the disk it will simply go to playing the last episode no matter what you do.  It's infuriating.
0425263924|2.0|I waited and waited for this book to release and I was disappointed. I do love Sylvia Day and I do not mind a 4th or 5th book but I believed she could have done better with this one.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I was rivited from the very first page.  Had read Gone Girl first, and I actually think this one is better.  It is very dark, as the title implies, but the twists keep coming just as in Gone Girl.  Characters are very well developed and memorable.  I must admitt it's a little &#34;gory&#34; in some parts, but for Stephen King fans, this is nothing.  I normally don't read books written by female authors for some reason, but Gillian Flynn is a notable exception.  On to her first novel, and hoping there are many more to come!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very good movie with a twist beautiful scenery and special effects and the story was exceptionally good. Would recommend this movie for anytime viewing.
0316776963|3.0|I bought this book because awhile back I happen to read one of the chapters from this memoir, the one entitled \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" In this chapter, Sedaris describes his struggles at learning French in a \\"sink or swim\\" language class. Being fully immersed in this class is made more difficult with the antics of the \\"language instructor from Hell\\" who goes after each student methodically. I enjoyed this chapter mainly because I think this is something we all could readily identify with in some way, and he came across as quite funny.<br /><br />After reading the entirety of Me Talk Pretty One Day though, I tend to agree with the reviewers who say that reading Sedaris is better left in moderation and smaller doses. His humor--snarky, cynical, sardonic, self-deprecating--is funny at times and moments, but over the long haul it loses its steam. Not only that, but reading an entire book by the author helps the reader begin to fully understand that Sedaris' humor is not so much self-deprecating as egocentric. I suppose this is the point, and that it's all part of his shtick, but it works against him and renders his book less entertaining, more annoying.<br /><br />In specific parts, I found Sedaris funny. I enjoyed the first chapter, \\"Go Carolina\\", where he talks about his visits to speech therapy. He finds a way to avoid all words that have the dreaded \\"s\\" in them as a way to help his self-esteem and avoid interrogation from his speech therapist. Some of the bits about him being a \\"mover\\" were funny as well, albeit over the top. Sections of his reflections about his visit to France are entertaining as well, as well as his attempts to learn the French and not fully being able to fit in.<br /><br />Over all, though, a good deal of the narrative loses its humor over the course of two hundred odd pages. Some chapters were entertaining, others were entirely pointless. The latter parts of the novel were a struggle to get through, and I found myself wanting to skim entire sections. By the end, it became sort of like a comedy routine gone too long, with repetitive material being thrown at us again and again, waiting for the light chuckles.<br /><br />This is my only read from this author, but I'm not sure if I will read this author again, unless it is a very short essay.
B00CY1JUW2|4.0|In the interest of full disclosure, let me start off by stating that I am no musician, so any high-level discussion of the merits of certain elements of how these songs are composed will not be found here.  However, I know what I like - and I like this album.<br />Other reviews will tell you that Like Clockwork is dark, and I'd agree with those reviews in a general sense.  &#34;Keep Your Eyes Peeled&#34;, &#34;Vampyre of Time and Memory&#34;, and &#34;I Appear Missing&#34; are &#34;dark&#34; either in sound, lyrics, or both.  But to focus on that element would be to ignore a significant part of the album.  There are tracks like &#34;I Sat by the Ocean&#34; and &#34;If I Had a Tail&#34; which are plucky, poppy tracks. &#34;Ocean&#34; follows immediately after &#34;Keep Your Eyes Peeled&#34; to pull you back up from the depths.  &#34;Tail&#34; invades your head with a dramatic hook that's hard to get rid of once you hear it, but its a welcome guest (to me, at least).  Then there's &#34;Fair Weather Friends&#34;, about which all I can say is it's layered with awesome (Elton John being one of said layers).<br /><br />To put it simply, if you like QOTSA, you will like this album.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|I think everyone in teh world has seen this epic & classic mobster film!! I believe everyone knows the lines!!! This movie is a masterpiece!! It is in the same category as &#34;The GodFather&#34; and &#34;JAWS&#34;

B007VUCAVO|5.0|If you have a Kindle Fire HD...then this app is a necessity! There's no \\"little green light\\" to show you're charged. The fact that I can see at a glance how much time I have for standby,surfing the web and all the other applications makes this a valuable tool. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.

B00D41H2PS|2.0|The premise of this game is fairly good however there are no hints no walkthrough nothing. You wander around the screens hoping you find objects  ( keys, codes, pieces of stuff) however no real clue where they go etc. A lot of the codes are so cryptic you will be pulling your hair out trying to figure it out.  I quit after 90 minutes. I had found a few things and were able to move through some of it but not worth the effort.  Hope the makers take a \\" hint\\" and put some kind of hints out there
B009NY43NY|5.0|Charlaine Harris does it again with twists and turns keeping you guessing about the ending with superb ease. I know Ms. Harris ended with Sookie being with Sam might be a good thing for Sookie but......I was hoping she and Alcede would be together.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I was slighlty diapponted to look down at the page marker in the Kindle and see I was 98% done with the book, the story is clearly not over. Hopefully more to come. Good modern (anti?) spy novel.

1476733953|5.0|You should read this book.  I don't care if you hate sci-fi and think it's silly.  This is not standard sci-fi.  This story will become a classic and I would not be surprised if it became required reading at some point.<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect.  This book was recommended by a friend, so I downloaded it without reading anything on it.  I was sucked in immediately.  Fascinated by the concept and the initial introduction to the plot, I could not put it down.  I was immediately drawn to the characters and the way the author set the stage was wonderful. There was immediate action and you could not help but be intrigued by the mysteries of the silo and its people. There is more I would love to say, but I don't want to even hint at spoilers - this is a journey you should take without any planning and without a road map. The story is truly imaginative, the writing is gripping and all the characters are written in such a fashion that you can either relate to them or know someone like them.  I absolutely love that the main characters were not too young (a la the YA dystopian fiction) and that there was such a diversity in the skills and personalities of the people you meet.<br /><br />It felt *real* and sometimes a little too close to home.  I could easily see something like this becoming a reality for our world and that should scare everyone. Yet despite all the darkness, the author still manages to leave a little light shining and you feel almost optimistic at the end!<br /><br />Bravo Mr. Howey, I can't wait to dig into SHIFT and DUST.

B000TGCR38|4.0|A Dutch production from 2006, Black Book is a metaphor for a document that details the opposite of [[ASIN:B00BEN0YP8 Schindler's List]] -- a book that verifies Jews double-crossed and murdered by Nazis and their Dutch collaborators. The multi-edged World War II film tells the story of a Dutch Jew (Carice von Houten) whose family is murdered by Nazis who becomes a spy for the Dutch resistance, playing the role of concubine for an important Nazi officer in the Dutch occupation near the end of the war. Her success is muted by changes she endures over the course of her action and the fact that even the resistance is filled with double agent collaboarators in bed with the Nazis at the expense of Dutch Jews.<br /><br />What a lot of critics disliked about this film is twofold. First, the Nazi officer (Ludwig M&uuml;ntze played by Sebastian Koch) is too nice and the female star falls in love with him which seems not only hypocritical but incongruous. Also, the production if typical of director Paul Verhoeven's movies. Like in [[ASIN:B000RLKCMI Robocop]], [[ASIN:B000OVLBHG Starship Troopers]] and [[ASIN:B0000JCFPE Basic Instinct]], Verhoeven (who also co-wrote the script) leaves subtlety on the cutting room floor and leaves little to the imagination when it comes to sexual content, gore and action. If either of these put you off, or if you seek a film with greater layering and more subtlety in characterization, Black Book is definitely not for you.<br /><br />But if you want 130 actioner minutes of continuous entertainment that never relents in its high energy formula, this is a film that will keep you riveted to the screen. I found Black Book to be equally an entertaining as any other Paul Verhoeven movie I have watched. It maintains the same high energy, dense action, limited characterization formula as his mainstream movies but with a lot of sexual content more akin to European than American war productions. One thing Black Book is not is family fare: there is too much sex, blood and guts for the kids. As adult entertainment it is outstanding.blood and guts for the kids. As adult entertainment it is outstanding.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Had a good listen to the CD on my iphone and the only critique I can level at it is that I thought Jeff Fosketts lovely falsetto voice needed mixing forward more....other than that fab!! great song selection, including songs like 'Don't Back Down' and 'When I grow up', songs not usually heard on a Beach Boys live recording. some members of The Wondermints which suppy some of the backing alongside the remnants of the original group are fantastic! yes I agree with the view some are giving about the DVD disappointingly only having half the CD's material although it was good in it's own right as a visual performance! Great to see David Marks there too! Yes this recording gets a 9 1/2 out of 10 from me!

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Loved Bared to You and Reflected in You, Entwined in you was a REAL let down, especially for $9.99. Loved Gideon as always but for the story to drag and then be left without an ending so that I might yet again spend $9.99, I'm really turned off and left sad I don't care what happens to Gideon and Eva.
B0081SKYDG|1.0|I know it was supposed to be a fun movie, but it's basically a ton of high school kids partying thinking it's the most awesome party ever.  There were some funny parts, but I'd rather watch something other than this.  It's just 'ok,' I wouldn't spend over $1 in order to see it, just my recommendation.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|My son, he is 36 I'm in my 60's, called me and said you have to read this book, you will love it. We recommend books to eachother all the time. Hounded is the first of the Druid Chronicles. The main person is the last of the Druids who is many centuries old. He will always be in his 20's. He has many magical gifts. He has a wolfhound that he can talk to and the dog is just hilarus, you will love him. His two lawyers are a werewolf and a vampire, his friends are witches. All in all this is a very entertaining book that teens, young adults and older folks would like. It gives you a lot of Druid history as well as folklore history.<br />It is a good read, a lot of laughts. Very enjoyable, I highly recommend it.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|When I finished this book, I didn't exactly know how I felt, but it definitely wasn't the same feeling I had when I finished the first 2 books. When I read the 1 star reviews, I really related to the comments people were leaving. While I was reading the book, I never felt that it had any real direction, or main focus. I also kept thinking that more and more unnecessary drama/conflict kept coming up. By 80% through the book, I had no clue how the book was going to wrap up satisfactorily. To my disappointment, the story didn't end with this book, but now has 2 more books following this. I have no problems reading a 5 book series. In fact, I just finished Shey Stahl's \\"Racing on the Edge\\" series (which I truly enjoyed). I've also read Jessica Sorensen \\"Fallen Star\\" series, and heck, I've even read the \\"Twilight\\" series. Although there were some books in the series I liked more than others, I never felt they were \\"fillers\\" to drag a story out unnecessarily, like I did with \\"Entwined with You\\". I really believe Gideon and Eva's story could have wrapped up with this book, but felt the author was just trying to squeeze out more that's just not there.<br /><br />I still gave the book 3 stars because I like Gideon and Eva, and thought the story was ok. I just didn't love it, and am disappointed that after months and months of waiting, I was left unsatisfied.

B0013F1D02|5.0|Not exactly like the book, but still highly entertaining and imaginative.  One of the most noticeable differences is the portrayal of the sky ship's captain.  In the movie, he is familiar with England, acts as a hairdresser, and commands an entire crew of lightning catchers.  Like the rest of the characters, including the witch, Stardust's characters are warm and welcoming without too much melodrama.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Elementary is a fantastic new series. It strikes a great balance of light hearted and serious. The banter between the two main characters underpins each week's story in such a way that you want to see what will happen next, but still feel a sense of closure with each week's ending. There is so much room for this series to grow; I can't wait to see where they take it for season 2.
193700788X|1.0|I could really care less what Charlaine has to say off page - in interviews, at her sites, and in articles regarding the last book in the series. The text should speak for itself - unfortunately it does NOT.<br />Thus, no amount of retcon, revisioning, explaining it away etc, by Harris, is going to make this book any better.<br />Sadly, it couldn't get any worse. It really couldn't. Yes, it's that bad.<br /><br />This book has got to be the absolute worst final book in a long standing series that I have ever read, ever.<br />EVER!<br />With the amount of books I've purchased and read - that is really saying something.<br />A huge disappointment and a complete waste of time and money. I can't even be bothered to ever re-read the earlier books that I did enjoy - knowing what's to come? No thank you. Never again.<br /><br />I think the term \\"We were Harrised\\" would be very apt for future books that are churned out just for the almighty dollar, when an author pulls a bait and switch, and when authors purposely string fans along for money i.e. quantity over quality.<br />Yes, we were \\"Harrised!\\"<br /><br />In closing - DEAD EVER AFTER is simply awful. Don't bother.

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|If your into trashy humor - then it's up your alley. I don't mind it, one of my favorite movies is &#34;The Hangover&#34; but, unlike Hangover(1 movie) it wasn't really witty, clever, or surprising. Just bluntly gross at times and pretty predictable. Which is too bad, cause I'm a big fan of both Mark Wahlberg and Seth Macfarlane.

0425263924|1.0|Yes, dear reader, you're right.  This can't possibly be the end.  Well Sylvia. . . its the end for me.  I really enjoyed the first two, but frankly your chase of the almighty dollar in book three left me vowing to never buy another one of your books. Not only was the storyline extremely thin and lacking any real thought, but your final line of yes, dear reader really ticked me off, and you are now turning a trilogy into a 5 book series.  I won't read them.  I guess you think that hot sex every other page makes up for story line. . . . . well it doesn't.  This book was an utter waste of time.  I'm back to Dan Brown who really knows how to write
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|**- Spoilers ahead -**<br />I have a new book boyfriend. Yup, I said that in the most immature sing song voice too.<br />How much do I love this book?! There's no scale to judge.<br />I've been one of the many Nalini Singh fans hanging on to her every facebook, twitter and blog post to snatch up the meager crumbs that were so scarce, poring over them for clues.<br />When authors give up the first chapters as a teaser, I don't take the bait - especially when I'm highly anticipating the book - but I couldn't resist this one. The more Singh hoarded her details the more I wanted to know and even though I knew it would drive me crazy to wait the couple of weeks to have the rest, I rapaciously devoured the chapters. I don't care about spoilers so finding out the hero was Kaleb was awesome. My only regrets on that score were not finding out who the heroine was and not incontrovertibly ascertaining the identity of the mysterious Ghost. I did manage to survive the two weeks, although my bibliophile friends will surely vouch that it was a close thing.<br />So I finally got the book. It was AMAZING. Since as I mentioned before that I don't mind spoilers I actually read some reviews prior (to check if I was setting myself up for a disappointment because I was so excited) and I honestly don't think knowing who the heroine was before reading affected my enjoyment of the book. My favorite thing about this series is the emotional bonds between the characters and the relationships. To me, knowing the name of the female wasn't as important as her character was. Now for the book itself...<br />In the first chapters of the book we find Kaleb with the mysterious woman, seemingly as cold and deeply entrenched in silence as one would expect from a former councilor known for his ruthlessness. That impression of the Psy male is soon wavering though as the book progresses. Sahara might be one woman, but the Silent don't do emotions - period - and it's evident that Kaleb does care about her. It's perfect that Sahara's official ability is Backsight since the history between Kaleb and Sahara is meted out to the reader in pieces as flashes of memory even as they move forward in the present. Kaleb is a strong male reminiscent of Judd, but not quite. He's edgier and darker. His aspirations far greater. As Santano Enrique's former protege he's got his secrets. Kaleb himself points out at the end of the book he will never be \\"good.\\" I want to disagree there. I know Kaleb knows himself, but I think he's shortchanging himself when he says he doesn't have a conscience. While I do believe he would go off the rails were something to happen to Sahara, he had decided on his own to spare the children when he purged the PsyNet after he took control. If he truly didn't care he would just wipe everyone out no? Plus \\"good\\" is relative.<br />I love Kaleb. It pains me to admit this, but it's possible I love him more than Judd or Hawke! That's a lot! And I  didn't even expect to like him. Something about a lethal, brooding man who turns to putty in his woman's hands, I suppose. There are many examples of how dangerous he truly is, but I couldn't help wanting to cuddle with him. And it's mostly because of his relationship with Sahara. Seeing the most powerful, calculating and ambitious man on the planet, the one everyone else is scared of, be so gentle with her... *Sighs* To. Die. For.<br />Sahara was no lightweight either. I wouldn't have loved this book nearly as much if the heroine wasn't worthy of such a strong lead.<br />When we first meet Sahara, she's a bedraggled, pitiful, broken woman cowering like a scared animal. After being held captive for years and tortured she's distrustful of everything and the man who \\"rescued\\" her. And who can blame her? She has no memory of Kaleb initially.<br />As time goes by, she begins to remember, but her mind is protecting her by doling out certain memories -gradually. I admire her strength. Sahara Kyriakus inspires sympathy at first,but there are glimpses of her fortitude and will soon enough and she finally emerges as a powerful individual in her own right. She never backs down with Kaleb. Of course, she knows he would never hurt her regardless.<br />This sweet, tender romance happens against a backdrop of violence and terror. The two of them are falling in love (again?) while the Pure Psy fanatics are raining terror on the world at large. Kaleb emerges on the world scene as a hero putting his dual cardinal powers to good use. Of course that's good PR for his campaign to take over the Net, but he's driven by more than that.<br />The sex scenes were scalding. For a couple of virgins Kaleb and Sahara heated up the pages and weren't embarrassed about it. The Psy do love their research. I had wondered how a Psy/Psy romance would work with both parties being emotionally distant. It did. Brilliantly. So well in fact, I want more of those pairings.<br />Not every Psy would have Kaleb's control however or Sahara's lack of silence. At the end of the book I'm worried and hopeful when it comes to Aden and Vasic and the future of the entire Arrow squad. I hope they both get their own books. I love the relationship between Aden and Vasic and I'd like to see them navigate their friendship and test their loyalty even as they find HEA's.<br />This was a busy book. Action (of one kind or the other) from start to finish and it was almost entirely focused on Kaleb and Sahara with brief pov's from Vasquez and Aden and Vasic. Personally, I like catching up with the other characters from previous books and having them steal a scene or two, but had that happened in Heart of Obsidian I don't think it would have been a smooth transition. Kaleb being Kaleb demanded all the attention and I didn't mind it in the least. There's tons more I'd have to take hours rehashing. Sahara's family's reaction to her re emergence, the interactions between her and the DarkRiver sentinels, Kaleb's seemingly un-Psy remark of \\"You're on my side of the bed,\\" orgasmic earthquakes and so much more.<br />Heart of Obsidian hit it out of the park. Nalini Singh does not disappoint. The world is changing and I have a sneaky suspicion we'll be seeing lots more of Kaleb Krycheck and Sahara. I can hardly wait! Five Kaleb Krychek stars!but there are glimpses of her fortitude and will soon enough and she finally emerges as a powerful individual in her own right. She never backs down with Kaleb. Of course, she knows he would never hurt her regardless.<br />This sweet, tender romance happens against a backdrop of violence and terror.

Action (of one kind or the other) from start to finish and it was almost entirely focused on Kaleb and Sahara with brief pov's from Vasquez and Aden and Vasic. Personally, I like catching up with the other characters from previous books and having them steal a scene or two, but had that happened in Heart of Obsidian I don't think it would have been a smooth transition. Kaleb being Kaleb demanded all the attention and I didn't mind it in the least. There's tons more I'd have to take hours rehashing. Sahara's family's reaction to her re emergence, the interactions between her and the DarkRiver sentinels, Kaleb's seemingly un-Psy remark of \\"You're onmy side of the bed,\\" orgasmic earthquakes and so much more.<br />Heart of Obsidian hit it out of the park. Nalini Singh does not disappoint. The world is changing and I have a sneaky suspicion we'll be seeing lots more of Kaleb Krycheck and Sahara. I can hardly wait! Five Kaleb Krychek stars!
B005LJITS0|3.0|Great Amazon streaming, but the movie wasn't fantastic or anything like that. This rating is based on the content of the product, not how I got it. Great streaming though.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I have read many of David Baldacci books, and have enjoyed all, but I think this one I liked the best. I have downloaded The Hit, but have not read it yet. I look forward to reading it.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Another good one, but Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill still my favorites... Don't watch if you are easily offended. xxxxx

0425263924|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but this series is written so well that you don't want to ever put down the book down. I would highly recommend this series to anyone!
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Sorry, but this needs a graph to show the battery drain history. One review says it has one but there isn't.

B0002VFXFE|4.0|Not really a glamorous product but essential. This the 1st time I needed to use paste. It looks much larger in the picture but more than enough for the job. Well worth the price.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Incredible! The character of Pi is so well developed and so convincing that everything that happened to him were believable and kept me reading right to the end.
0425252868|5.0|I am a huge military book fan and love th occasional thriller but when I saw the wonderful art that was made in honor of the true story I couldn't help but buy this book and read it. Needless to say to the other readers, I could not put her down. This book is a quick and easy read but has more substance than most books I have ever read. You don't have to be a military book lover for this you just have to have that little flame of humanity left inside of you. Gives you a new perspective of our enemy during World War II and puts a new perspective in my eyes of not only the crazy and horrifying aspects of war but the strength and unity that these prior enemies came to attain in their later years. Not kidding I recommend this book to all readers I meet and I even have the art \\" in the presence of my enemy\\" hanging in my room. You'll never forget it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Another OK read. I wouldn't recommend it. It seemed to take a long time to get anywhere. OK as a light time filler read.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I have chosen to follow mostly conservative ppl and enjoy reading their posts.  I was surprised that the Governor of my state is following ME!  That may have caused me to be more cautious about my posts.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've always loved this game!! I have it on my kindle fire, iphone, and xbox 360. It's a masterpiece and it will be legendary. you can build what ever you want on creative, and you can start from scratch on survival and mine your own materials. you can release that imaginary world of yours and put it on this video game. it will always be amazing.
0800177975|5.0|This was a favorite movie of mine as a child so I ordered it for my son and I to watch together. Now he really likes it too.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Quite a different take on your normal TV legal drama. I guess the show confirms the fact that all you really need to know is how to read and knowledge will be at the tip of your fingers.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Offbeat and different not like the trash that is all over TV now. This is something that I could watch.

B005FFW46S|3.0|I have been a Pratchett fan for a long time however, this book is not one of his best. While it has all the trademarks of classic Pratchett it feels like something is missing from this book. Sam is just not as much of a lovable and likeable character as the other Discworld characters and this truly shows in the writing. There were things I liked about the book however. This included the fact that this is an attempt to transform a comedic and quirky world into a more serious story for new readers. Overall I give this book 3 stars because while it was a good read it is not worth reading a second time.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|It's a good app, but after a while the amount of time you have until the battery dies is inaccurate. It's constantly running so it's hard to say that it helps. It kinda will kill your battery if you're not wise with your timing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|im not that far into the game so far but right now I really love taking care of my hosre

B0050DZN4K|3.0|Works ok, but wastes screen space. Web front end requires software installation. Not as fast as greader.  Still dependent on end of life google product.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love all the things about this CD especially Bruno Mars!! He is so awesome and what do the young firls call this, I think that He is Hot!!  I intend to agree. I could look at him forever. lol.  But purchase this CD and you will be glad you did.I had no idea who he was, since I listen mostly to country songs. My daughter and grand daughter told me to get it and listen to it. I am glad I did.

You are a pleasure to listen too!! :-)

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw this movie and loved it and knew I had to read the book. I started reading and was blown away by the quality of writing - not just the story, but the humor and drama and subject matter and every tiny ingredient involved in this delicious literary casserole. As a writer myself, there are so many things here to commend, and I try to note them all in my review. The movie and the book are different in a lot of ways. But I think the movie retained the spirit of the book. And so does the author. So I'm with him.<br /><br />Writing Technique: ★★★★1/2 Quick is a brilliant writer. He turns a guy with crippling mental illness, violent tendencies, and a serious one-track mind into a heart-warming, charming, hilarious, and moving narrative. Let this be a study for all novelists in voice, because this guy nails it. He also unravels a compelling modern hero's journey with a very limited first person POV. This work is fantastic.<br /><br />Plot/Story Development: ★★★★ As I said, this is a modern hero's journey. Pat is not your typical hero (see more in char dev). But his journey is truly admirable. He leaves a neural health institution with one goal in mind: be reunited with his wife Nikki. Every single action he takes is made with her in mind: working out obsessively, his attitude and actions toward others, his pursuit of a greater literary education, etc. He is trying to write his own story - his own movie. He is single-minded in his pursuit of a happy ending, a true silver lining. It doesn't go exactly as planned, which is to be expected. And here is where novelists should study Quick's work, because it is a model case study of want v. need. As The Rolling Stones said so eloquently: &#34;You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, well you might find...you get what you need.&#34; (Now that song's stuck in your head. You're welcome.)<br /><br />Character Development: ★★★★1/2 So what does Pat need? Well, he thinks he needs Nikki. But we all know he doesn't need Nikki. He needs to adjust to his new reality. To find embrace his new life and find a happy ending in it and not in the past. Pat's not your typical hero because he's psychologically ill. His treatment, his healing is a long internal process. And I love seeing where he's at on the last page. The closing line for me is beautiful.<br /><br />Message/Theme: ★★★★★ I love the difficult issues this book tackles. And having read some author interviews, I admire him for writing something that reflects at least in part a personal struggle. SLP addresses depression, mental illness, grief, physical and emotional abuse, marriage, love, friendship, family, obsession, personal growth, and the true nature of happy endings.<br /><br />Rating: R for language and sexuality<br /><br />Audiobook Performance: ★★★★ Ray Porter is a great voice for Pat's somewhat deranged inner monologue. He also excels at all the men's voices - Philly, Indian, inner city black accents - he nails 'em all. But all the women sound exactly the same. It's difficult being a voice actor, I know, but it drew me out of the moment a few times. Especially when Jeanie and Tiffany talk back and forth, there was no change. So points lost.<br /><br />Overall: ★★★★1/2 This is a great read. I don't think I could possibly recommend it more.<br /><br />And yes, you should watch the movie too.t we all know he doesn't need Nikki. He needs to adjust to his new reality.

B0089LOG02|3.0|On the plus side, I found the historical aspects of the orphan train interesting. Mostly, it did not plow new ground for me. I am tired of the literary technique of history, one chapter, present-day, one chapter. Sometimes it works. I didn't find it successful in this case.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Glad I found this app. I just switched from the first generation to the HD and l miss the Orange light.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played on the Xbox and when I heard of a pocket edition I got it immediately<br />Definitely worth it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the novels can't wait for the south one to come out. I hope it comes out sooner then later.

B00A83075M|4.0|Very sweet and very kid friendly. It has an interesting twist at the end and a nice message about learning to appreciate who you are. As an adult, it was a little dull at times; however it was great fun for the kids. I would highly recommend this movie for family nights.

1582701709|5.0|This book is a pleasure to the eye, in the first place. The graphics are wonderful, and you can tell that every little detail has been thought over and carefully chosen with love and great skills.<br />The contents I found to be truly well expressed, in a way that compels the reader to give them all his attention, and then deeply reflect on various crucial aspects of our life. It is rich of information that seem so simple, yet so important and deep, explained in a very light and positive way. You gather serenity and relief by reading this book, and I now like to keep it at hand, to remind me of all the positive things I learned from it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Can't stop reading this book love it 100%this is the best book I ever read can't waste till I read the next one

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is very awesome and creative but the only thing they are missing is the update for the pocket edition it would be better if they added that toooo &deg;0&deg;
B002TLSSXO|3.0|Just like the cheap stuff it replaced, the ends of the turners are already showing peeling damage. Elevate idea for placing on counter works to a point, although if you have something dripping, it's still going to drip on the surface. Joseph should be ashamed for the price!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love iit,!!!! Everyone should try this app out. It's the best yet so get it now before it's too late.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|Save your money, this was a waste of time to read, I really was looking forward to it being released, the last of the series and was so disappointed.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I know very little of North Korea. After reading this wonderful novel, I know a little more, and it's not pretty. That being said, I felt it to be profoundly moving.<br />The prose, while quite simple, is mesmerizing. I is the best book I've read in some time, and I hail the Pulitzer committee in choosing it for Best Fiction for 2013.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Love playing playing epic. The graphics are good and there is always something to play. I love the mushroom race the most.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|That feeling I got when I first read Lord of the Rings. Dune. The Amber Chronicles. McCaffrey's Pern books. That feeling which is part discovery, excitement, and wonder which has been sadly lacking in recent reading excursions, hit me hard when I started reading The Way of Kings.<br /><br />As others have noted, Sanderson's storytelling is clean and accessible, although the number of characters introduced in this first book is a bit overwhelming. I realized how lazy a reader I had become as I forced myself to carefully read, rather than skim, the text. It was worth the extra time. The ecology and powers that shape the world of Roshar seemed fresh and new, minimally recycled from any other epic fantasy. (When I finished The Way of Kings, I did feel echoes of David Eddings, although Sanderson can write rings around Eddings.)<br /><br />Themewise what I came away with was a surprisingly poignant look at conflict, duty and moral responsibility. I feel silly having to say this -- but considering the amount of sexual material in much of fantastic fiction today, this (smut-free) novel can be highly recommended to any age reader.<br /><br />Borrow or buy The Way of Kings (the price is astoundingly low for this quality of fiction), and you'll find yourself reading the final words of book one, wishing book two was already available!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is for all geeks. Best game ever like the title and I love it. it is so cool.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We never watched The Good Wife  until a friend recommended it.  So we began with season one from Amazon Prime and we love it. The story line follows a logical procession of events as The Good Wife copes with her husband's infidelities and incarceration.  Her attitude toward her husband turns as she finds out that his is in prison as a result of a setup, and his enemies are intent in keeping in there forever.  After we finish looking at Season One, we will move on  to the following seasons and eventually catch up.  Bravo to the writers for keeping this show interesting.
B00B0VI1XQ|5.0|Excellent mix of several musical styles from hip-hop to house, with some funk and a smooth jazz finish!<br /><br />I saw them in Portland at the legendary Crystal Ballroom, and I had high hopes.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|QUARTET is a delight!<br /><br />Set in a home for retired musicians, this British comedy, directed by Dustin Hoffman, boasts a cast of some of the UK's most revered vintage performers, including Maggie Smith, Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly and Michael Gambon.<br /><br />Beecham House is buzzing with activity.  The residents are preparing for their annual gala, and this year the event is particularly important because, if it is not a success, the retirement home might be forced to close.<br /><br />Into this aged disorder comes a new resident (Smith), once an internationally renowned opera star, but now virtually broke and in need of a new hip.  She is also the former singing partner of Collins, Connolly and Courtenay, her former husband who has never forgiven her for her infidelity.<br /><br />Can past transgressions be forgiven?  If so, then perhaps the revered opera quartet can stage a special reunion for the gala and thereby save Beecham House.<br /><br />Ronald Harwood adapted his witty, quite touching stage play to the screen, and Hoffman has done a masterful job directing.  The cast is nothing short of absolute perfection.<br /><br />Extras on the DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment include audio commentary by Hoffman, plus several \\"Behind the scenes\\" featurettes.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B007EECSFA|5.0|A breathtaking story of love, life, family and relationships. The author draws you into the story in such a way that makes it hard to put the book down at night. This is my first Kate Morton book and I am really looking forward to reading more of her work.
0345803507|5.0|I enjoyed the entire trilogy.  This book was in excellent condition, almost like new. It was the right price too.  I wish all book sellers products listed as \\"like new\\" really were like new.  I received the book a lot quicker than I expected it.  Excellent source for books.
B00742GBDM|5.0|Frances O'Connor's Fanny is a much more spunky, likable character than the one in Jane Austin's original story. This is no soft spoken doormat miss.  This Fanny is witty, clever and not afraid to speak her -well developed- mind.<br />Those who are fans of the series &#34;Elementary&#34; will be interested to see Johnny Lee Miller younger but still an excellent actor in a different role.<br />The story is all that Austin fans could hope for:  A strong female heroine and a man who appreciates her for who she is rather than how she looks.<br />A keen humorous-but-truthful look at the flaws of human nature, especially in those born of privilege.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Josh Homme and crew have made a great batch of music.  Each song has its own unique musical twist and story.  The dynamics and musical elements these musicians have created blend well. Buy it, sit back, relax and be taken away in the creative artistic genius that is QOTSA.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My cousin Jared showed me this game and said it was addicting. He was right! I love this game so so so much.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|For years I thought that the tiger talked so I avoided this book like the plague. Finally I broke down and decided to read it. There is nothing Doolittle about this book. It is an imaginative story of survival. It is not all dreary. It is charming, funny and utterly entertaining.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|This guy is one of the most underrated musicians around today and I'm actually glad he is because that means I can always get a good seat when he comes to my area to play. Incredible guitar picking and beautiful melodies, no wonder he's done movie scores throughout his career. I put him a special category of musicians that have always appealed to me since I started collecting music.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|A page turner! Cloud Atlas weaves together 6 different stories each from a different time ranging from 1800s to1930s  1970s to present to future  and post catastrophic future. The stories are populated by common souls and offers insight into the how human souls tie together space and time. My favorite thing about this book is David Mitchell's use of language to convey time frames. The words and phasing that he uses in the 1800s is true to that time for example. I spent a fair amount of time looking up authentic old ship terms for example.  Similarly when he is writing the future story  and the post catastrophic future story he actually invents two new forms of the English language to capture the feel of those times. But since these words are the author's invention you cannot &#34;look them up&#34; It is truly a pleasure to decipher the meanings of his invented future terms while reading the book. It is a fun game. Cloud Atlas is a long book that is not long enough. I felt a sense of loss when I finished the book. :)
B004VD3YIM|2.0|Bought for my Foscam fi8910w. There is no pan nor tilt and loses signal constantly. Also, the audio input / output is not working.
B0001I561E|2.0|DVD had scratches and it skips, so my kids were disappointed that is does not work great. Was hoping it was better that that.
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|Had to buy this one after being disappointed with the tinyCam Monitor Pro for my Foscam fi8910w. The interface is not the best but it works as advertised with pan, tilt, zoom in and out, and good audio!
B005LAII8K|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, especially with Bruce Willis and JG-L attached to it. The story was original and seemed very interesting. Unfortunately they didn't take advantage of any of those things. The acting was pretty good but I felt like it could've been better. I think both of them are really good at showing emotion but didn't in this film because of their characters. They had a few moments where they could have developed their characters more and allowed them to really act, but they just left them bland. The film crept at a slow pace, at some point I thought it would pick up but it never did. I also thought there would be more action then there was. Even the final scene was pretty calm. They had the potential to make some sweet fight scenes but it just never happened. The ending was really lame, it wasn't anything huge or emotionally gripping, it didn't leave me in shock and aww or wanting more. It was more of a, \\"oh...that kind of sucks\\" feeling. I also felt like they were leading the audience to side with Willis, wanting him to carry out his mission, but then the ending just threw it all out the window. Overall I wouldn't buy this movie, it just didn't work for me. Some parts were interesting (which is what they showed in the trailer) but the rest was just kind of basic stuff.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Make no mistake: this movie is not your grandaddy's Trek.  Per this latest sequel, the rebooted \\"Star Trek\\" franchise with director J.J. Abrams in the driver's seat is now confirmed as an adrenaline-pumping, warp-speed summer action adventure series with razzle-dazzle special effects.  Yes, Abrams' take on Trek is incredibly superficial as compared to the more intelligent, thematic films that the original cast appeared in.  You certainly won't be finding timeless literary references to Dickens, Melville, or even Shakespeare in J.J.'s movie.  That said, I still absolutely enjoyed seeing this film in the thrill of opening weekend and chose at the time to ignore its glaring flaws.  Hence, I hope you will find my review well-balanced as follows.<br /><br />THE GOOD: In terms of performances, the ensemble (Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, etc.) and newcomers Benedict Cumberbatch, Alice Eve, and Peter Weller provide top-flight entertainment equal to, if not better than the 2009 film.  Even if McCoy, Chekov, and especially Sulu have minimal screen time, the cast members each receive great individual moments.  Predictably, Kirk and Spock both have big action scenes, as Spock finally gets his first solo fistfight (it is well worth waiting for, especially for who gives him some help).  Alice Eve (as young Dr. Carol Marcus), Peter Weller (as Admiral Marcus), and Benedict Cumberbatch (as the mysterious John Harrison) blend seamlessly into the fast-paced, energetic storyline, as long as one can suspend disbelief about the script's plot holes.  Supported by a terrific musical score, the gaudy special effects are mostly superb, if not particularly realistic.  Without a doubt, the engagingly brash story is sufficient for the price of admission to see this movie.  Just think of it as a sneak preview of what likely director Abrams will do with the next \\"Star Wars\\" film in 2015.<br /><br />THE BAD: Yes, there are some spoilers here.  As much as I appreciated the wink-wink homages to \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" (watch for Kirk's use of the Han Solo phrase \\"Punch it!\\" and a familiar banking flight maneuver escaping from the Klingons) and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" (Kirk and McCoy do their best Indiana Jones imitations fleeing from pursuing aliens in the opening sequence), it struck me that Abrams' screenwriting team should have tried harder to push originality and depth over the \\"ain't it cool\\" approach.  Case in point: the finale from \\"STII: The Wrath of Khan\\" is so blatantly lifted (and then \\"reimagined\\") that STII's screenwriters, director Nicholas Meyer and producer Harve Bennett, should have been at least acknowledged in the new film's lengthy credits.  Further, Cumberbatch's super-soldier is actually pretty generic compared to the original, fiendishly flamboyant incarnation of Trek's greatest villain, Khan.  Cumberbatch is an excellent actor, but he is not Khan - the late Ricardo Montalban made Khan so believably diabolical as is.  Here, viewers are supposed to believe that the new Khan is somehow both a super-soldier and a genius 23rd Century weapons designer thawed out from the 1990's by the Federation.  As a result, we get Kirk & Spock vs. Khan, Round 3 on steroids - even after thirty years, the two previous doses of Khan (from 1967 TV episode \\"Space Seed\\" and 1982's \\"STII\\") still remain plenty enough.<br /><br />Unfortunately, using ESP-powered Gary Mitchell (from the original series' pilot episode) as the film's villain didn't happen.  It would have made far more sense to use him for the Federation's treacherous secret weapon, complete with a personal grudge against Captain Kirk already in place.  Cumberbatch would have excelled playing Mitchell.  Further, the plot twists involving Admiral Marcus and a monster-sized starship OR a starship crashing OR Federation treachery OR a resurrected major character have already been done before in Trek movies.  Instead of exploring some strange new worlds in this alternate timeline, Abrams andthe screenwriting team certainly deserve an EPA achievement award for all the recycling they end up doing here.<br /><br />THE QUESTIONABLE: Unlike its 2009 predecessor, \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" hasn't inspired a glut of kid-oriented merchandising, especially toys.  That is a wise choice, as there are several adult scenes that are inappropriate for younger viewers.  I'm not just talking about the massive amounts of sci-fi violence (including the crushing of a human head and a violent attack against a defenseless woman), but there are also two instances of implied sexual content that easily could have been omitted.  Hence, please remember that the PG-13 rating is definitely justifiable.  As a final note, any appearance by Leonard Nimoy is always appreciated, but his cameo was frankly unnecessary.  I suspect he was included simply to bolster credibility of this new Khan storyline.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the 2009 film, then I highly recommend \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\" -- even if the entertaining, depth-free script digs into the Trek archives far too often instead of boldly going somewhere else no one has gone before.<br /><br />Rating: 4/5 stars.<br /><br />P.S.  It is unclear when or if Paramount Studios will make another Trek film assuming media reports are accurate that the studio wasn't happy with an opening weekend box office take of less than $100 million dollars.  Time will tell, but any greedy studio should remember that a bloated movie budget doesn't override the law of unrealistic expectations.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book!!!! I love this series! I cries and laughed. But the hunger games movie SUCKED! Really.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It is truly amazing how Lincoln used his power...and the main use was in humility and grace. Every leader should read it and take notes.
B001N8V7KA|5.0|We liked Firefox mostly because we like Clint Eastwood. There will never be another &#34;make my day&#34; actor like Clint. We found this to be a good story and then Clint made our day anyway. A good movie for us at a low price.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I think this is the best music Blake has recorded so far!  My favorite song, right now, is &#34;Boys Round Here&#34;, which I find so fun to sing along with.  The whole CD is a &#34;sing-along&#34;!  Blake, and his lovely wife, Miranda Lambert, are the big stars in country music at this time and I think they deserve it.  I share some of the same values as they do and I will always be one of their biggest fans!
B003XQ2VOG|5.0|In our opinion all these movies are good ones especially for their time. We were after Fantastic Voyage which just happen to be the first VHS movie we ever bought and The Lost World also on VHS. All these DVDs have good quality.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book!!  I loved that its from the male POV...it was so funny and I loved the occasional illustrations!!
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Not a bad movie, but it could have had a better plot. Maybe we missed something here and if we watch it again, it will come together for us. For now it is just okay in our opinion.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Like others have said, I was so excited about this 3rd book and finding out what happened next. I fell in love with Eva and Gideon and like the first two books so much better than the 50 Shades series.<br />This book was such a let down to me. I was so disappointed and frustrated at the ending and feel like I have been cheated. I felt like the other characters were brought in too much and that made the story line start getting thin. I also felt like drama was having to be grasp at and that made the story go in too many directions.<br />One positive is that I like Gideon even more and was melted by his sweet charm and ability to express himself and his feelings better to Eva. This quote got me \\"I look at you, angel, and I want you so badly. I want to be with you, listen to you, talk to you. I want to hear you laugh and hold you when you cry. I want to sit next to you, breathe the same air, share the same life. I want to wake up to you like this every day forever. I want you.\\" I mean WOW!!<br />I truly hope that the next book comes out quickly before too many people lose interest and that it is better than this one.
B0000JCFPE|5.0|We checked this one out at our local public library and like it so much we decided to buy it. The story is good and Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas acting is very good. Not a movie for the kids though.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This is one of those rare books that is beautifully written and makes you really think about the society we live in. The characters described in a manner which allows us to believe they are real people, and their thoughts and actions could be many of ours..<br /><br />I really appreciate Ms. Fowler saying the things that need to be said so clearly. You won't regret reading this book!
B00AEBB86A|5.0|I like Mark Wahlberg movies any way. But this is a really cool film. Mark strikes again! If you have not seen this movie, Check it out.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Combination of action and romance in the right proportion. I'm all for the unlikely person becoming the hero in the story.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Everyone enjoys playing this game. Getting rewards and using different vehicles continues to keep the game entertaining and challenging. Recommend this game to anyone.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Classic John Grisham drops you right into the story and keeps you reading.  It was funny and sad and good.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I read the book first and went to see the movie.  There were a few things I think if they had put in the movie, would have improved the movie.  One part I would have liked to have seen was the part in the book where Wanda describes some of the other worlds that she and been to.  Another part that should have been included was about a character they left out of the movie.  I don't remember his name, but he was dying of cancer, and they learned that she had compassion for people other than her/their brother.<br />  I know that it was probably budget reasons for some things not included in the movie, so I can understand things like this, I do wonder if the director read the book.  I enjoyed the movie and was excited to finally get to see it.  I will buy this movie when it comes out bluray.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It took awhile for me to get into the story. The narrative is so different, but it finally grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. Well written yet so different from your typical novel. I am sure it will promote great discussions in our book club.
B0041D843M|5.0|This Book Is Complete With References For His Research. I Couldn't Put It Down. I Read It In About 5 Days. This Has Changed The Way I Look At Food And The USRDA Guidelines. I'm Recommending It To EveryoneI Know.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Wit was the second time we had seen it. We didn't realize until we got into it, but my husband and I both enjoyed it the first time, so we kept watching.  It is a fun shoot me up movie, lots of laughs and surprises.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is easy to learn and goes by at a perfect pace. I recommend it for a simple problem solving game. We all could work on those skills!
0425263924|2.0|I must say I am very disappointed with this book....for a number of reasons.  1) The release date was pushed back TWICE.  I assumed since the date had been pushed back, Sylvia was intending to make the book even better by re-writing or adding to the story.  2) This book was supposed to be a TRILOGY...but now there is going to be a total of five?  3) The book was lagging.  I had very, very high hopes for this book considering the first two were just PERFECT.  I was expecting to learn a lot about Gideon and his daemons/background, but instead we got barely anything.  I was looking for some closure in this book, and I just didn't get any.  Yes...there were some good parts, but I did NOT get what I was expecting.  I waited a year for this book to come out, and I must same I am very disappointed.<br /><br />I wouldn't even call the ending a Cliffhanger...the book just ended in some random spot.  No leaving us wanting more, no CLIMAX, no anything!  I thought to myself, is the book really over?  Why did Sylvia just end it right there.  THERE WAS NO POINT!<br /><br />Sylvia went way over board talking about secondary characters.  We want to read about Eva and Gideon's story...NOT Corrine.  And I just wish Cary would get his head on straight.  And what was the point of even having Magdalene in the story?  She was in the first and the last chapter...that's it.  Does she have a purpose anymore?<br /><br />Sylvia Day, you better be able to make up for your lag of story, depth, and climax in the next book!
B0098460O4|5.0|Excellent music and great voices.  The first time I heard them sing, it made me cry!  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|As Reviewed on The Lost Book Reports<br /><br />Personally, I was really disappointed with the series. I was iffy about book one, book two made me obsessed and book three made me think it was a fluke. The book was all gore and no real context. I didn't even feel like the ending was right. It was almost like Collins gave up and just gave us all the ending we wanted, without really taking us from A to B. Yes, there were some clever moments, but overall I wasn't impressed. Too Predictable and Infuriating.
B00908DDZM|5.0|If you like their popular tracks &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; and &#34;Can't hold us&#34;, I am confident you will like every other track on this album!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|For some strange reason  I now have an app to watch tv shows. I wanted to be able to listen to the radio. I try to download this several times. Maybe if you can download right it might be a great app.
B00AW57L96|5.0|So any twists. It was not what I expected. Everything relates to everything else and things are not what they seem.
B00884GR0W|4.0|this can be very addicting, I was lucky and got it for free, I end up being a real gamer and love games like this. I played it for a really long time and got to level 75 and finally found the game when more fun if you do get this game every time you level up do upgrade your sword power although it says sword it not just for that because I fought a dragon with my bare fists but it gets really fun and easy so do enjoy! :)
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great graphics , thrilling , a lot of fun in a single game , hard to get bored, and you can rest your fingers with the baloon stage , while you collect more coins, runs great in Kindle Fire HD.
B001J1S4F2|5.0|This movie is the best man! It has everything a movie could ever need.. Lust, thrill, great acting, great character delineation, I loved it!! It's my all time favorite movie.. And I think Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer really elevate this movie's intensity and power. Such a great movie it clearly states just how far people are willing to go in pursuit of victory over another person. I loved the acting the characters everything
B0076DELIG|3.0|Harry Bosch is the penultimate homicide detective who manages to overcome unforeseen and frequently contrived obstacles to bring truth and justice to the human condition.  His motives are frequently personal but shared by those of us who value the fine line between contradictory elements within any large police department.  You can depend upon Mr. Connelly to keep a few well conceived facts to himself until it is time to share with us, his readers.
B003TH14H4|4.0|I had not really heard anything about Castle before my fiancee happened to be in the right place at the right time to catch part of an episode. Afterwards we started watching it and we have now caught up to the current episodes (Season 5 at present).<br /><br />This show starts out strong, and develops the characters and story to the point that we became all the more engaged by season five. The show is not afraid to make fun of itself and has a predictable episode arch (hint: it's always one of the first few people they interview!), but these characteristics have only ended up endearing the show more and more to me (&#34;who is it,&#34; &#34;I think it's him,&#34; &#34;No, it's her!&#34;)<br /><br />I rate this season specifically four stars, the entire show though is a solid five!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I attended a concert in Kansas City with a friend after having enjoyed The Piano Guys YouTube videos for several months.  I enjoy their entertaining, sometimes hilarious scenic videos.  I often wonder \\"How did they get the piano there?\\" as I watched their videos.  But always, I enjoyed their music.  The first video I saw of theirs was the \\"Secrets\\" version with Tiffany Alvord (who is a fantastic talent as well).  I loved the orchestration with Stephen and the symphony behind him.  I especially liked the full version with Stephen and the symphony.  I purchased one of their videos at the concert but found out about the pre-release special of this album and DVD. I wanted to take advantage of this special value and have not regretted the decision.<br />  A day or so after receiving the new CD, I had a trip of a couple of hours to attend graduation ceremonies of a niece.  I put on this CD first and sailed down the road humming along or beating on the steering wheel to the music or \\"directing\\" the symphony.  That car was rocking for the entire drive.  As I decided to not stay overnight, by the time I began my drive back, it was late and would be well past midnight when I returned home.  I again put the CD on and enjoyed another couple of hours of lively entertainment.  Surprisingly, I was not tired when reaching my home at 1 AM.  That's what good music can do and, this album is good music!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am completely invested in finding out who survives. I am sad that I have to wait for the next installment.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I compare Downton Abbey Masterpiece to a comfortable shoe.<br />A work you do not tire of because of how it guides you<br />through human behaviors with grace and charm.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like this app.  I downloaded it because it was free today, but as I sit in the waiting room at the hospital playing games and wondering how much longer I have on my battery, it has been great.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|interesting plot, mcconaughey acted outstanding in the movie. hope they make a sequel or real soon! great movie once again.
0812993845|3.0|The book itself was not a good read, but I had to finish it anyway. The seller was awesome as I got the book in 3 days.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Bubble mania is basically a super cute kitty version of bust-a-move. I honestly don't even remember when I downloaded this game but I've been playing it since! I've reach the last island (Level 169-174) so far and I'm having the hardest time trying to pass these levels. The graphics are super cute... especially when the little kitty gets angry when you've failed the level. IT is a bit frustrating when you can't pass the level but it's fun and satisfying when you FINALLY do! I've been playing this game so much that I even got my boyfriend to download it hahah. It's FREE and fun so why not?! :)
B00499NHLC|5.0|Amazon asked me how many stars I would give Sherlock. I would give it all the stars. The cast is absolutely fabulous, they make great innovations with the characters while not taking away from what they were originally. Everyone should watch this series.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book, although I had read it before but many years ago.  The characters in this book are very interesting and I enjoyed the style in which it was written.
B007G92QGO|5.0|This is a heart wrenching story that cut to the chase. It tells of an experience that any ordinary family could be open to. it draws the reader deep into the story with great sympathy.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and the cast (especially the kids) did a fantastic job of depicting a horrible tragedy. What it took to get through that is unthinkable. Excellent acting.
0761171703|5.0|To see highly skilled dancers doing their thing in street clothes in everyday places makes me want to up and dance in the streets! And the photographer has created amazing stop-motion  scenarios.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A non-fiction with the easy read of a novel.  Written with humor.  Cheryl laughed at herself as she trudged forward; never loosing site of her goal...to finish!  A wonderful story of learning to live with the curves life gives us.  I would recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game just wish you would not always start at beginning.wish at some point you would start at different level
B0085YOD1A|5.0|it works really well and it is really helpful. I definitely would reccomend it to anyone that has a tablet or smartphone
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I was very excited to read this book.  Travel writing is one of my favorite genres.  This author very much has a knack for taking her readers on the journey with her, and in just a few words, she managed to interweave her personal life throughout her trek on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).  I was kept interested throughout the majority of the book, but at times found myself asking, \\"So what?\\"  I sometimes wondered the purpose of various meetings and small journeys within the larger journey, and I still don't think I have the answer to that.  Yet, that is really what life is about--making sense out of things that might not, at the time, make sense.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book overall.  She was quite honest about herself, and I really have to commend her on that.  It takes guts to reveal so much about one's self, and she really opened up to us and gave us the raw side of her.<br /><br />I think she ended the book too quickly at the end.  I would have liked her to have ended the PCT experience a bit earlier and focused on what happened directly afterwards to give us some perspective on how her life immediately changed (or didn't change).  However, I enjoyed escaping to that time and place.  It inspired me to get up and do the same thing in my life, even though I haven't decided what that is quite yet.<br /><br />Great book for the adventuresome/ dreamer types out there!
B000002N1E|5.0|I bought this for just 1 song, but found others I like after playing it.<br />Prince has been a true star, you don't see him going to jail for drugs. Keep up the good work!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Tear jerker in a happy way!  Be kinder than is necessary :-). Maybe there is hope for humankind.  Would totally recommend this book to all ages.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Still reading it.  But, I do have an opinion. It appears to be relavent to today's policical atmosphere.  It reminds me of Gorge Orwell's 1984 which predicted the monitoring of the citizens that we are experiencing now.  There are camers everywhere.<br /><br />Clancy has picked up on a political threat to the U.S. which we are experiencing now in it's apparent &#34;infancy&#34;.  Cann't wait to see how it comes out.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Love Bruno Mars Music.... You have a little variety in this Unothordox Album. 4/5 stars... Worth every penny!! Get your Bruno Mars Album Now!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I knew Adam Makos was working on his first book and this blows past all possible expectations.  He draws you into the story in a captivating way which allows you to get to know Franz and WANT to know him.  To see something this beautiful and inspiring unfold from such a horrific moment in human history is so refreshing and such a gift to all who read it.  Thanks, Adam, for a fantastic first outing as an author.  I will likely read your \\"Higher Call\\" many, many times over.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I think this is an excellent app and recommend this to anyone that wants an alarm as well as temperature as well as the time.
B000HZD168|4.0|Audio is only 2 Chanel Would like to see it have 5.1 Chanel the video was nice<br />Would watch again and will watch more trek
B0085YOD1A|5.0|You can tell the battery power and turn on notification to tell you when it is low  and see when you need to charge it
B0055SWM08|4.0|Game is simple at first but of course gets more challenging as you go. Some levels its very difficult to figure out how to make the minimum moves. Definitely stretches the mind and the way you think.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This was a free app, so of course I downloaded it.  What an ADDICTION!  I find myself playing this game everyday.  Once I use my coins I wait for it to charge up again.  It takes twenty minutes if you leave the game on.  If you close the game, it takes a few hours.  Unless you purchase more coins.  I find the game fascinating.  I'm not sure if there's a certain techniques or method to get the coins, but it doesn't matter.  I'm having too much fun trying to get the coins.  For a free app it's more than worth it.
B008B9PK2U|2.0|I am a long-time ABB fan; I think they are one of the greatest rock bands ever. I have various CDs and box sets of the ABB and have seen them live.<br /><br />HOWEVER, this one (I have the CD remastered version) is a big disappointment. Granted it is difficult to measure up to their \\"LIve At Fillmore East\\" album - one of the best ever for ANY band.  This one lacks the musicianship, tightness, and great solos of the Fillmore East CD - but most recordings by any other group lack that also. Every version on this \\"A & R Studios\\" falls WAAAY short of the Fillmore East versions, and the additions not on the FIllmore albun are also lackluster.<br /><br />On some cuts, the piano player sounds like he is drunkenly punching a bag with boxing gloves on his hands - I cannot believe that any musician could be so lame (I don't think it was Greg, who can weave in, out and around the ABB stellar guitarists). If I don't throw this one away, I'll give it to the first taker.<br /><br />Skip this one; there are many ABB recordings superior to this one. (I only give it Two Stars instead of One, because they ARE the Allman Brothers Band with Duane).
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is so much fun. It seem like I couldn't put my device down. I kept wanting to see what happened next.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I cannot say enough about this movie. There is something in it for EVERYONE!! Fun for a whole family to watch. Fun for a couple on a date and a fun 'pick me up' for anyone wanting to have fun watching a movie by themselves. I REALLY hope that Disney films a sequel. I will be first in line. JUST GREAT FUN!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app!!! Im leaving middle school this year and this app is perfect for staying in touch with my friends that aren't going to the same high school as me. I like how you can create group conversations to talk to multiple people at once. Most of all: this app is really fast.
193700788X|1.0|I want to thank many of you for saving my money on this book.  The only thing worse than being very disappointed over this drivel would be having to pay for the bad experience.  I can't bear to even read for free about so many silly plot lines.  I'll just remember Sookie and the other characters the way they were created before Charlaine lost interest.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I've learnt so much about my hair that I've never known. My story is like that of many curly girls in denial. Thanks for sharing these simple tips! Time for me to recover my fabulous curls!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I'm a big fan of Cut The Rope and this app is great for people like me who love ancient history. XD I recommend it to everyone!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Amazing read...I was absolutely involved with these characters and could not put it down.  It also makes you think about \\"living\\" and challenging oneself.  Go for it, worth it and a great summer read!
B001KZVQJI|5.0|Blue rays usually have a really good quality.  I was not disappointed.  I love this movie (all of them) and I am pleased to add this one to my collection.  The service was very prompt.  Many thanks.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|UUGH, book 2 was bad enough but I had hope that the dysfunction would be resolved and I would see a HEA in book 3. I bought it on the first day and got half way through and was already disgusted with both characters but especially Ava - she is a crazy, spoiled, drama creating child. I took a break and decided to check the amazon reviews to see how other readers were feeling. Once I read that this series is going to continue with 2 additional books, I knew what I had to do...stop reading and move on to better books! Uugh, these two need professional help and reading about all their drama is exhausting. If some resolution doesn't come in this book, I have absolutely no interest in finishing it much less reading 2 additional $10 novels. You got greedy Ms. Day and ruined a perfectly good trilogy. I hope you are reading these reviews and re-thinking your decision. There are too many great books in this genre to waste any more time with this series.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I almost didn't finish reading the book, I skipped quite a few paragraphs at times! Too repetitive, yes we know how you feel, we get it by now no need to over do it with the drawn out issues. I feel like the third book was a revised version of the second book. I give up on this &#34;trilogy&#34;, I can't take it anymore.
B0086700CM|4.0|Good, Bad, and just UGLY.<br /><br />Good: Addicting, arcade, forever until you die. Love the good.<br /><br />Bad: Lag start, &quot;Tripping&quot;. Sometimes the bad is annoying, but it's easy to ignore.<br /><br />UGLY: Lag Lag Lag Lag Lag when something that's not the app alerts you. Ugly is rare.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The title makes this kinds self - explanatory but I will do this anyway. I just bought this game and it is absolutely the best! It's a bit similar to other games I have played but there is more creativity involved. There are several different, I guess, &quot;characters&quot; in the game and they all do different things. This, and many other things, make the game unique from all others. This game is great to pass time or to just have some strategic fun. And it's free! That alone should make you want to buy Pudding Monsters! Buy it now. No regrets. All fun.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is easily one of the most fascinating books that I have read.  I know nothing about computers, but that doesn't stop me from appreciating the amazing Steve Jobs phenomenon.  I had no idea what he had accomplished(or how unlikeable he was).  Makes him and the book just that much more fascinating!
B001GM28HO|5.0|The Fame... what is there to say about it then, WOW!! All the songs are fun, upbeat, dance-pop, totaly original, and inspiring. From the fun bubbly Just Dance to the Gambling Poker Face to the Club Hit LoveGame to the Addicting Paparazzi! Lady Gaga combines modern Pop music with classic DiscoRetro of the 80's and 70's. The name \\"The Fame\\" means the good side of fame, fortune, money, love, popularity, and success. All in all the with a total success! What a GREAT way to start off!!!!!! (As you can tell I'm a Little Monster)
B009LXEBD4|5.0|It is easy to forget just how many great songs that Kelly Clarkson has produced.  We sing along with all of the songs on this one!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Every time time I thought I knew what was happening, the book would prove me wrong and say \\"Bet you didn't think of that one.\\" Is just astonishing.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. With Sandra Bullock and Tom Hanks starring, the story begins in New York during the events of 9/11. Rather than being a movie about despair and hopelessness, this movie is one of unique vision. Each character has a distinct personality rarely seen in most movies. This movie is based on a book by Jonathan Foer. I have also read the book and it was even better than the movie, with drawings, photographs that were in the main characters' , Oskar Schell's journals. I recommend reading the book and viewing the movie. In which order is entirely up to you. During the movie, I wanted so much to be a fly on the wall , to see inside Oskar's journals and scoot under his bed with him. In the book, you can. I will watch the movie and read the book over and over again; a rarity in any medium. Never is the movie as good as the book. In this case it isn't but it sure is close...until we can enter the movie itself and see from all angles...more than 3D that is. That is what imagination is for and why we read.

B007REV4T8|5.0|The latest in the James Bond thrillers doesn't disappoint. I saw this at the theater and had to add it to my collection.  Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond. There is no escaping an evening with Bond, shaken not stirred. The locations are remote, the women elegant, the man enigmatic and the action always sure to keep you up late at night. Bond is one series that will continue to please time after time. I don't believe there is an equal...but then I do love a man in a suit.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|I can't get past the choose a name part in the beginning every time I chose a name it says failure to connect I don't know why I've tried tons of different names please fix.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This is my first venture into Daft Punk and I was quite happy.  Good, deep, provoking synthesis.  It has a lot of replay value, and has made subsequent viewings of Tron that much more enjoyable.
B0089XH38M|2.0|Installed just fine, scan went well &amp; it found a security problem. I was excited it did what it was supposed to &amp; found the chink in the armor.  I was directed to click on a button that would take me to the problem &amp; that's where the problem started. It wouldn't go anywhere, just froze. There was an update available so I installed that. No luck there, still frozen. I even uninstalled it all &amp; tried again with the same results.  I use this program on my home computers  &amp; feel fairly secure but now I am left wondering if I should go back to Norton's.  I gave it two stars because it DID scan &amp; found the problem...it just won't fix it. Any suggestions?
B0085YOD1A|5.0|since kindle fire doesn't have a percent next to the battery, this helps me a lot, and it also tells you how much time you have left until your battery dies. really cool
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After the first chapter I was disgusted with the trash that one would think such junk represented anything such as this was worth reading. No wondered there are so many stupid uneducated freaks out there if they read trash like this<br />.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Great action triller.I have read various books by Ken Follett and have enjoyed all of them. I am waiting for the third book from his latest series.
B002L3ARRU|4.0|It''s and Original movie, makes you feel part of thay day of you always dream about. i'm sure you will enjoy this movie.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|I've read all three novels by Stohl and Garcia, and enjoyed them.  The movie interpretation of Beautiful Creatures was disappointing.  Plot line was changed, the ending confusing, the acting terrible.  I understand a need to compress the story to fit two hours or so, but compressing two key characters into one is a travesty.  I'd give it one star, but I like Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Subject was fascinating, but the writing was very confusing, characters not defined well.  Excellent window into the North Korean lifestyle, which is frightening.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I'm done with this book yet but so fay I can only give it three stars. It is an odd way to tell a story.
B0052VI2WA|5.0|what a splendid album!<br />dans ma jeunesse j'avais la totalité des albums de YES en LP, dernièrement j'ai investi dans une chaine stéréo moyen de gamme ONKYO avec lecteur SACD C-S5VL, et là je comprends pourquoi le format MP3 est de la merde! je redécouvre toute la magie des compositions musicales des années 70. dommage que ce format SACD soit commercialement un échec.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|Love them! Can't wait for next season!!!! Eeeeee!!! I dont want to spoil things for those that haven't seen them so i can only say i have seversl favorite episodes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game because if you want to create stuff with no limits you can play on creative but if you want to try to survive and live of the land you can play on survival.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Always handy to have a calculator available and often times when I'm on the Kindle I need to do some math work.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Very unhappy !!!!!!! I'm confused more than anything !!!!!!!!!!What happened with this book ???????? Very very boring !!!! What else can I say !!!!!!!! NOTHING !!!!!!!!!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|If one wants a gripping well written story, get this book.  Ken Follett delivers again.  The characters are well defined.  The story had substance and intrigue.  It is one of those books that you won't want to put down and don't want to end.  It is a real gem.
B003FL4O9E|5.0|Brough back the good ole' days - would highly recommend if you want to reminisce on some Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
B0070YDOT8|4.0|I chose this game because I love playing casino games.I also am trying to learn card games and their betting rules.the game.we are very realistic and I would recommend this app to all players
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This is a really great dress up game. There are several hairstyle, eye-color, jewelry, and clothing items. I highly recommend it.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|There are some surprisingly good characters considering this is a typical teen movie and some good actors to make up for the bad ones.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a really big fan of minecraft pe but my brother has a ipod and he arlready got 0.7.0. So please hurry up with the update for kindle fire.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I just can't stop playing. It's simple and fun. The levels are pretty easy, but there are a few that stump.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is easy to play and fun for both children and adults.  I will enjoy seeing how the game progresses.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Im glad i spent the money for this game. It is definitely a lot better than most of the hidden obect games out there. I play this game all the time I just don't like waiting for energy haha.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I love the premise behind Doctor Who. I think most of the episodes are very well written. I like the plot twists that the show throws at you, how you think you know whats going to happen and it takes you in a completely different direction. I'd recommend this to anyone who's looking for a good show to watch.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a great app because it shows you how much battery you have left, if your battery is fully charged &amp; whether or not if you have enought battery left to play a game or watch a movie.
0670014893|2.0|This book contains far too much extraneous detail. I did not even finish it and believe it was over rated by NY Times.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I had already read in an interview that this wasn't the last book of this series, which bummed me out because I'm a quick reader and I knew I'd have how ever much longer till the next book is out to know what happens next.<br /><br />So this book starts right where it left off in reflected in you.  We all know Gideon murdered Nathan. In this book it goes back and forth from Eva kind of feeling some remorse for Nathan's death but then not really because he was her tormentor/rapist.<br />Honestly, Gideon does too much for this chick, she doesn't deserve him, at all. So besides Gideon having nightmares about his rapist, now he's having nightmares about Nathan. And Eva is all of a sudden the stronger one.<br /><br />AND.....<br /><br />Seriously, how does anyone think they can out smart the police in a murder investigation?  I can't understand how they're trying to be low-key yet they're neighbors in this book and they're smashing like 24 effing 7. Like how not obvious is that? If I was smashing my neighbor it would be super obvious.<br /><br />Also, he wants her forever and she does too but she has to think about it? I guess my love life is so uncomplicated that I don't understand these complicated relationships.<br /><br />Any who, enough of my ramblings.....<br /><br />The sex scenes were meh, it started with one a little too early for my taste, but it is an erotic novel, that's how they are. BUT it did get pretty repetitive after a while and downright pervertive. The author was super gross and twisted.<br /><br />I feel like there is too much coming into play with this novel and things can be wrapped up in the next book. Just wrap it up!<br /><br />Also, it would be greatly appreciated if the next book came out ASAP because I do this crazy thing where I read several books and by the time the next one is published and available for purchase I have already forgotten everything about the story. That's true pain in the ass.'s true pain in the ass.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|What's not to love.  Leslie Neilsen Robby the Robot Walter Pidgeon.  The first Sci Fi Movie I ever saw and still one of the best!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I've played a lot of bingo games, but this one is by far the best one! It does glitch occassionally but not very often. And this game offers so much more than the usual bingo out there. I highly recommend this game for anyone that loves bingoing!
0743289692|5.0|Very enlightening, the problems she talks about are very important and should be everyone's concern<br />Very enlightening, the problems she talks about are very important and should be everyone's concern
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I love the game, but after you've completed all of the challenges your score stops going up so you may not be able to beat the game. I'm about 770,000 and I've played at least a dozen rounds since I finished the last challenge with no change in my score.<br /><br />Also the unlocks run out pretty early on.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Some of the other book reading apps are little more user friendly as far as finding specific pages. but I have found this one to be excellent when it comes to study material. underlinin,  highlightin, making notes all can be done very easily.
B009NY43NY|5.0|This book is not being given the credit it deserves. No Sookie doesn't end up with Bill or Eric. After admitting to herself that there are things she wants out of life that a vampire can't give her she goes t o Sam. If you remember she always had feelings for him but always told herself that it was inappropriate because he was her boss. It would have been stupid for her to continue on with a vampire. With them her life was always in danger with no positive outlook for a happy life. I thought it stayed true to Sookie's upbringing.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Great stories. Amazing characters. Fall in love with the original show all over again. It was definitely ahead of its time. Watching the series is a Great way to rekindle your interest in Star Trek.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Cute game. Makes you think a lot on the strategy to get to the next level. Good game to make you think.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|I am so glad that I switched from DVD to Blu Ray- the extra features and better quality are worth it!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books but was EXTREMELY dissappointed in this supposed &#34;last&#34; one. Someone needs to buy Sylvia Day a thesaurus, and her recycling of so many lines from the first two books was outright unacceptable. I wipe my hands clean of this &#34;trilogy&#34;.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|I am so glad that I switched from DVD to Blu Ray- the extra features and better quality are worth it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the original feel of the story, which seemed to wrap around a clever study of humanity. It is written on recognizable stages made alien by the world they are set in.
B003274QH6|5.0|I am so glad that I switched from DVD to Blu Ray- the extra features and better quality are worth it!
B004KPX5GC|5.0|Great Disney film.  Classic old movie style good family movie. Great story about a strong woman who saw her race through the end.  This movie is not just about a great horse but about determination, strength and faith.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|I am so glad that I switched from DVD to Blu Ray- the extra features and better quality are worth it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the story between Gideon and Eva. I think this is my favorite book in the series...so far. You won't be disappointed.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|This battery monitor said I only had 43 minutes of battery left at 73%, which was wrong. I have several other monitors installed that are all more accurate than this was. When I had 72%, this one said I had 75% battery left. Don't waste your time with this.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game. This game is full of fun and entertainment. You will be relaxed after playing this game. You will love it too<br /><br />...
0439023521|5.0|With this book I have all the books in this really cool series I hope you read it before I Bought it.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The USB cable did not work, it did not meet my expectations.  My kindle still does not get charged as it should
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So I love this series..  if you have read the rest of the books then I think you'll agree this one is just as good.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Wonderful book. From start to finish it keeps your interest and reminds you how powerful true love is!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|The Watchmen really set the standard for graphic novels with its thought-provoking storyline and explosive art. What would the world be like if Nixon had remained president for more than two terms and superheroes were real people with real issues? What would you do if you could save the world but at the cost of millions of lives? This should be required reading for all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and fast it's great fun for kids to adults it really helps eye hand coordination and timing.  A great time for anyone. Have fun!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|My kindle power button doesn't always light up when it's charging so I downloaded this ap i itt 'sp. Now n be sure it's charging and it tells me how long out will take to charge. Worth the download
B00D2K40WY|5.0|it is so so awesome you really should get this app so get it for me you need to get it thx
B009NY43NY|4.0|eric turned out not to be a keeper, not a big surprise, always thought sookie and sam woud be good together, unless she decided she wanted to be turned into a vampire
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and it is totally not a waste of time in plus the theme changes<br />so you dont have to look at the same theme in plus u can get prizes if you complete<br />sertan things
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a wonderfully writen story which has a very nice ending. I later saw the movie and would recommend the book even if you saw the movie. The book goes into much more detail of the developing friendship of the two main characters. I loved it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app I have it on my kindle and its the best texting app in the whole world!!! Anyways it's just like texting on a phone but I'm texting on a kindle fire! Anyways I can text my Best friends ever now it's so awesome this app is worth it you should get it I love it I'm addicted to kik I'm always on kik so worth it it's worth to pay for
0857521233|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  I'm an elementary school librarian and wanted to read this book before ordering it for our school library.  I love to give \\"Book Talks\\" and tell students a little about a book I enjoyed, and encourage them to read it.  This is a book I will be highly recommending!  The author does an excellent job with the characters.  I felt like I knew Auggie and his family by the time it was over!  I felt Auggie's pain as well as his triumphs.  This is the kind of story that will make you laugh and cry, but also want to stand up and cheer!  Loved it!  Highly recommended!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game has caught my eye, at first I was unsure about playing. Now I am addicted, and getting it in HD free I love it. I recommend this game to all ages.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I haven't actually used it yet, but I have looked through it and am very impressed what it can do.  I am really glad that I downloaded this app...I will use it often!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think you should make a Go Kart, a Train, a Water Level, and a Jet Ski. Thank you carsen.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I love that it has a divide on it.  I use the divide a lot and several others don't have it!
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I read DIARY of a WIMPY KID  it was a good book but it wasn't great because the movie was better
0425263924|2.0|I couldn't wait to read the ending of this story. I was sad when the release date was pushed back again and again. Now I finally see it show up on my kindle, I am reading like crazy, and what do I get for it? NOTHING!!!<br /><br />Was it hot? Yes<br /><br />Was it anything else a book should be? No<br /><br />I am reading, and reading, waiting for a climax, and there is none.<br /><br />Then I figure oh great another cliffhanger? Really? I CAN'T even get another cliffhanger!!!<br /><br />This was a total waste of a summer read.<br /><br />I'll tell you what Ms. Day, since you are apparently more interested in money and the number of books you produce versus how happy your readers are, this reader won't read another word.  I won't be strung along and toyed with. You're a seasoned author you should know better. Good riddance!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am not much of a book reader but heard so many people talking about the 50 shades.. Needless to say I read all 3 in a month.. I absolutely loved this book. It has an awesome story line. I hope there is a 4th one!
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Cruise does not \\"nail\\" it if you read the books . And too compare this to X-mens Wolverine and Hugh Jackman is assinine. This movie did not do justice to the Jack Reacher in the novels and anyone saying he did is mentally misplaced. The only movie Cruise did that was entertaining was The Last Samurai. Hooray to the wife of one reveiwer for not seeing it.<br />This movie needed to have a new face play Reacher, not Tom Cruise they always cast him in roles from books that the character is so much more that his pretty boy wimpishness, as in Interview with the Vampire he ruined your mental image, Oh well not many people read anymore so all the Cruise groupies will rejoice at him playing a character they have never heard of. This movie was horrible .
B000V6OMJS|4.0|Downloaded this album to replace a taped version that my wife had that was not very acousticly great.  Very happy with this digital MP3 version and is a good value to boot.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like this game even though it can be very slow advancing to the next level, I would recommend this
B00BI73CVI|4.0|This film is a faithful staging of the Broadway Play.  It is beautiful to look at.  There is fine acting, but the singing is bit uneven.  Not bad, but not uniformly excellent. Anne Hathaway as Fantine and Samantha Barks as Éponine steal the show with excellent singing and haunting performances.
B009X2CRMK|3.0|The story was not enthralling.  A similar story line to past books by the same author. But then again, I'm a reader not an author and I couldn't write as well.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|The only reason that this book gets 2 stars is because the story itself isn't so bad. You get a decent inside perspect of World War II from the various countries involved. However, the writing is beyond horrible and there is nothing left to the imagination. Every event (major or minor) is completely predictable. Things just work out for everyone. Completely unbelievable and boring. The level of writing can't be greater than 8th Grade. Very disappointing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy spider solitaire and this one is fun and it has harder levels that are quite a challenge.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 4-year old daughter LOVES this app!!! Before she went to bed she reminded me to take care of her horses. :-)
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|So disappointed with this. I loved the first half of the book and the second half felt so rushed and I don't even know what to say about the ending. I thought I was reading a Trilogy and then to find out I have to wait ( who knows how long) for a fourth book?!?!?!? Again, so disappointed.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This is the first Kathy Reichs book I've read.  I was surprised as it was nothing like the TV series I watch.  An enjoyable read from cover to cover.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I liked the fact that I was unable to figure what was going on until the end. This is a great story with lots of ins and outs.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Excellent, couldn't put it down! Great read into the darkness of heroin and how it will destroy everything you would work so hard for.
B000GCFY0I|3.0|This would have gotten four stars, but I wasn't interested in this book at all until page 100, which is way too late.  I would have found it to be fine if I had at least liked the book at the start, but I literally had to force myself to read it up until that page, which is NOT fun.  I would have abandoned this book, had it not been for friends assuring me that Uglies was one of their favorites and that I would love it.  That being said, once I got past a turtle-slow beginning, Uglies was a very interesting read.<br /><br />This book was wasn't a generic YA dystopian title: oh, life sucks, every one's dying kind of stuff. It has its own unique spin on the government's oppression, with a plot that didn't seem too familiar to me.  And later, it became even more intriguing. By the end of the book, I was left wanting more. And there were some unexpected plot twists, which I absolutely love.<br /><br />This book isn't a plain, just-for-fun story, either. It brought up some questions for me. Would I dislike it if everyone got to be pretty?  What would I do to obtain 'prettiness'?<br /><br />The only thing I could not stand was that, as I have already said, I didn't like was the fact that the first 100 pages were absolutely boring for me. It took me at least two weeks to get into this book, because I didn't want to read it. And when I did, I found Tally to be shallow and selfish at first. I ended up liking her, but I was annoyed with her for a while.  I know that her selfishness is intended, but for some reason, it still rubbed me the wrong way.  This fact didn't have any affect my rating, though, since it is my problem and not the book's.<br /><br />So a good book, but one that is unbearably slow to start.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the game it's good and everything but some of my friends said they got the 7.0 update but I checked the store and didn't find the update. Why is that?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy access you can take all your books anywhere and read whatever suits your mood! You can get access on any device.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a classic read and will be the type of Tome in the class of Tolkien, the levels of detail and the past history are all carefully thought out there is a logic and progression to the background, the reads will become so involved that it so hard to put down. I recommend this book and the whole series to everyone, you will love the Starks, hate the Lannisters, but yet you will admire them as well for their cunning its a gotta read. Get It!
0307352153|4.0|I could relate to the information about introverts, being one.  At age 62, my experience has helped me gain insight into being an introvert, but the book was interesting as an introvert, a parent, and a teacher.  Loved the part about the financial breakdown of 2008.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Great movie Liam! You still have it. I can't wait for your next one, soon I hope. Make it a good one.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|Nalini has done it again, created a wonderful story.  You get a glimpse of previous characters, but the focus in on Kaleb and Sahara; they are enough to grab your interest and keep you reading.  Looking forward to the next installment in this engaging series.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Great movie Arnold! You still have it. I can't wait for your next one, soon I hope. Make it a good one.
B008602KQI|4.0|thought it was a very good example of a future scenario that is realy not that far from reality.....based on the path this country is currently moving towards, it should make people think!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Light and unobtrusive. I have a kindle fire hd, so usually you would have to slide the menu, then do a few more clocks just to see a percentage. Now all I have to do is slide and take a quick look. Definitely a good free app. Worth the money too if you missed it being free.
B0027MJU00|5.0|How can psychological horror glint with humor and flawed characters endear completely? I could despise and love Flynn's characters as much as my own self; they were that credible.
B0068FYZSE|5.0|I love the movie..because she so beautiful... and she dance so good..all the kids dance good too.... I really love the movie @.@
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have never read a Nicholas Sparks book that I did not LOVE.  I could not put it down.  It keeps you involved!
B003VANOFY|5.0|very comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Wireless is very convenient and the battery life is extremely long, usually somewhere between 5 and 10 hours (haven't really timed it exactly). I've had a friend comment that in a voice chat the sound quality from the headset microphone was much clearer than sound quality of microphones other people were using. The G buttons on the side of the headset are very convenient, I personally use them a lot for listening to music (pausing songs, skipping to next song, etc). the auto-mute on the mic when it is folded up is nice, honestly i use that more than the mute button on the side. I've read on other wireless headsets that they can't be used while they're recharging and I love that this headset does not have that problem. The only bad thing that i can say about this headset is that occasionally the volume wheel will stop working for no apparent reason, but this is easily fixed by turning off the headset and turning it back on(approximately a 2-3 second process so not a big deal)
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I really enjoy playing PM,  but I think it's a little too easy so far. I finished the first level to perfection in less than half an hour. I think my kids will like it a lot, though.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|I can't think of a close second in this genre and hope that Ellen Burstyn continues to make more movies like this one.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I loved how this movie showed the different circumstances upon which people have kids. It really showed what was important in having a family and how pregnancy wasn't all fun and games.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book had an unexpected ending, but it was a slow read & definitely has a style on writing to which I am not accustomed.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Another fun puzzler from Zeptolab, I like that only the end positioning matters, not the number of moves - for determining how many stars you earn.
B005HSL626|1.0|I just did not find this game entertaining.  It did not seem to have a goal and did not keep me playing as so many other games have done.
B002WTC92E|1.0|I downloaded this while on a trip because I finished my other book and remembered enjoying The Devil Wears Prada. I made myself finish it, despite thinking it was idiotic garbage. Like other reviewers have said, the characters were shallow and selfish, and the writing was just as shallow and superficial. I'm a 33 year old single woman, and I can guarantee that I would never loudly lament my single, childless status in a crowded restaurant. If this is what's important to women and how women treat each other, then I feel sorry for all of us.
0307887960|5.0|Easy to follow. Noticed weight change within a week and keeping weight down. The recipes though was off our taste. But I used the diea well and modified the spices.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It is simple to use. Small app. Would like to see a battery looking icon in task bar instead of just numbers.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This program is very exciting every week.  Keeps ones interest and doesn't get boring. Can't wait for the next season
B00005R24K|4.0|Cult classic that goes with the other 2 movies; Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.  Can't have one without the other two!
B005721W9O|5.0|Galaxy Quest was a perfect &#34;spoof&#34; for the time! Tongue in cheek all the way, yet done with charm and humor!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|I have always been a big Pink Floyd Fan from way back.  I enjoy this CD very much.  Thanks Amazon
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I typically guess the twists and turns in books and movies. A movie like this one that keeps me guessing until the end I really enjoy.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This was a pretty good book. I felt like some of it mimicked the movie sleeping with the enemy.  I still enjoyed reading it
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved reading this book, so much that I couldn't put it down! I am only hoping the move follows the book.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I thought a trilogy was three. Too many cliffhangers.  At the end of the book it doesn't even say when the next book is coming out. I love Eva and Gideon.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was as great as the first two in the series. I couldn't put the book down and was compelled to keep reading, but then sad when there wasn't more to read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game once you start playing you want to keep playing. Plus it's free that makes it all the better!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was hooked after the first few pages and couldn't put it down. I will be sad when I have completed the series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I have never played game better than Leps World!!!!!!!!!!<br />I play the game every day!!!!!!!!!!<br />Everyone should get the game!!!!!!!!!!
B00A757EFW|3.0|The game is not a full version you only get to play two levels before it starts over. Not to fun
B0063M22QO|3.0|Every click comes with a gong like sound, and BOY does it get annoying after a short time! Other than that little blot, the game is pretty okay.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I've been a die-hard Rod Stewart fan since 1980 and I believe this is some of his finest work. Lyrics are meaningful and tunes are catchy. Well done, Rod, well done.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I couldn't choose the layout or anything, just had to play what they gave me. I like games with choices, and this one doesn't have them.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|this movie is so much fun. it spoofs  many classsic westerns such as &#34;The High Country&#34; and Clint Eastwood as well.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love that I can just tap the icon and it takes me straight to my inbox without having to log in over and over again. The layout is simple and not filled filled with adds!
B000AARKOO|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven is one of my favorite films. I love the history it portrays. the sets are amazing, the music beautiful, the photography stunning, the costumes fabulous Ridley Scott  is such a marvelous director. Also the special comments are so helpful in understanding of the making of this Crusades epic
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have yet to experience any trouble with this app! Quick, easy, and entertaining! Best of all, it's FREE!!!! Highly recommended!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|Great little app game that is really fun for all ages. It is really cute with all of the little eyes on the little blobs.
B003B02O14|4.0|Plenty of twists and turns. Found it  hard to put down.  I would recommend  this work to all Grisham fans!
B0015AARJI|5.0|VERY FINE PRODUCT, THE SAME THAT IN THE PICTURE, I HOPE I WILL BUY IN ANOTHER TIME, FROM VENEZUELA...THANKS YOU
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|This was not what I thought it would be it was just like the first one except the back round
B003UESJFG|5.0|I love this movie! Sure I bought it for my 4 year old but I know it was more for me.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|my son likes it. he will play it for 1 to 3 hours until the kindle runs out of power.
B00821OX98|5.0|Never watched this prior to watching it on Prime....watched season 1 and Season 2 and looking forward to Season 3...Amazon Prime has fantastic HD quality
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well... I love this game every time I have free Time or something I always find myself playing this game... and I just think this is a really good game and I love it
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Love the graphics and the game itself. Very entertaining, challenging and fun to play. Sadly you'll have to spend more money if you want to see the tricks
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Love g5 games very challenging the puzzles were hard but fun. Five dollars is kind of high but it was a good game.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Fun and addictive. To be terrific this game needs to be fine tuned by manufacturer.<br />Could use indepth playing info,  explanation of special balls  abilities and better<br />screen contrast.
B009CWWFD2|5.0|In his usual style we follow two people from different backgrounds from early on to a great climax. A great read full of fun twists and surprises.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Love It! My husbands favorite show. And bought all the seasons, and are waiting on the fifth season to arrive.
B00C3MKCIS|5.0|First I have to say that this is one of THE BEST albums I have ever heard. Period. The writing and playing work incredibly well on this album and the sounds are absolutely amazing, expanding outward, upward and inward!! Top-notch musicianship and songwriting performance here. They really seem to have picked up where Genesis left off (the album is even mixed by Nick Davis) as a kind of Genesis for the 21st Century. It's almost as if Phil has passed the torch on to his son Simon and given his blessing on being the best, just as Peter, Phil, Steve, Tony and Mike once were as a band in Genesis. Sound of Contact have that same gift and power. If you don't believe me, just buy a copy and LISTEN!! There are some who have helped keep the flame alive, such as Steve Hackett himself, Peter Gabriel, Steven Wilson, Fish, Marillion, Spock's Beard, Lifesigns, Big Big Train, Frost (Milliontown), and many others that deserve great credit too, but for some reason this band seems to have nailed it even more successfully. I had heard a song or two on YouTube and I was impressed, but when I sat down to listen to the entire album, I was blown away!! So do yourself a favor and listen to this from beginning to end, then let us know what you think. Quite frankly, I am going to go as far as to compare it to \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" for the new millenium because there is some definate Pink Floyd influence in there too (you can even hear a sample of Echoes off in the far distance in one track!). It just doesn't get much better than this! Wow!!!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|My Husband just loves it! and we bought all the seasons and are currently waiting on the fifth season! Cool!
B005DF2QMC|2.0|THE CASSETTE DECK IS NOT BEING RECONIZED BY MY COMPUTER. I AM GETTING AN ERROR MESSAGE.  I AM STILL<br />TRYING TO FINE THE REASON.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|My husbands favorite show! we all the seasons and are currently waiting on the fifth season on its way now!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am very much enjoying this series and I have loved being able to watch it free with Amazon Prime!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|My husbands favorite show! The quality could be better but other wise were happy! And. we will get them all
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey but had not been watching it while it was being aired live.  A friend suggested I see it and I began watching Seasons 1 and 2 on Amazon Prime.  I was disappointed when I realized that Amazon charges to view Season 3!  My friend had recorded and saved Season 3, so I am watching her recordings but somehow she missed Episode 3 of Season 3 so I bit the bullet and paid to watch that one.<br /><br />From now on I will watch live and record it myself so that hopefully I won't have to pay to view any episodes in the future.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|The game reminds me of cut the rope.  It is cute.  I like the animation.  Not one of the games I can't put down, though.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I love this album it is one of the best i have heard in a long time. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves music.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Long time QotSA fan, and I really enjoy this album--bit of a mix of Era Vulgaris and Lullabies, if that helps at all!
0793563836|4.0|A very complete bass guitar lesson book. I just need to spend the time to apply it all and learn it!
B00296A4F4|5.0|Glee is amazing and it has the most amazing cast and creator and music in it I love glee finchel is my favorite on and off screen couple
B0085YOD1A|4.0|this is a great app with more than just a battary I got kit because it was free that day
0756659841|5.0|My 4 year old loves this book.  We have been completing a page everyday.  He is so excited to go find the stickers and match them up to the characters.  The only complaint I have is that there are some character stickers together but then the rest are scattered throughout the pages.  The stickers are reusable which are great for when my son sticks them and needs to restick them.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought it was a great book ready for the next one only disappointed about no information for the next one
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great even if you don't have young children!  A must see for everyone!  My college kids and I loved it!
B007IK44CK|4.0|It's your typical Mission Impossible and a little far fetched, but I enjoyed it. Tom Cruise is always good in this type of movie and he definitely makes it exciting. There were some interesting twists in it as well. I would recommend it to everyone who likes this movie genre; it was definitely entertaining. The only problem with it I had was the sound. I had my sound on the computer turned up to the fullest and still had problems hearing it. I might have put five stars if the sound had been better.
0553801473|5.0|I am absolutely drawn in and enchanted by this series of books.  I cannot wait for the next one.  I think this one tied in a lot of characters that will finally allow for the beginning of the end of this series.  No it doesn't come close to book 3 but yes it is entirely necessary for the final wars to rake place.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Shocking when certain scenes happen but can't put book down and make you want to keep reading to see what happen
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Liked the action effects of animals vs animals, tiger vs boy, ocean storms, etc.  Cinematography was great!<br />Did not care for the adult Pi with his tiring cutesy, heavy-lidded interaction with his co-star.  It seemed forced and unnatural.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Different lifestyle but interesting to read other ways of relationships and not just the same old romance novels althought very saucy.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I've gone back and forth with this book. I loved the first 2 parts of the series but this dragged on to me. A lot of the story points seemed unnecessary and the author keeps opening new doors without closing old doors. I'm sure she plans to do so in the future but it's giving me bad flash backs of Fifty Shades, which I didn't like at all. I was also disappointed that the series was continued, I really wanted to see a happy ending but I guess I'll just have to wait.<br /><br />That being said, I'm so glad we keep finding out more about Gideon, I really like his character and can't wait to see how he further develops.<br /><br />I know, this review is a little all over the place but it kind of matches the story.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|Loved the story line and what the bond between boy and horse was like.  Also, shows the harshness of war.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Just a great book. Very well written and easy to read and follow. The story really really gives a sense of what it would have been like to be a part of the politics, the madness and the ability to find peace in war. These stories should never be forgotten.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Story line easy reading and although got a bit graphic at times really enoyed and showed a different way of life.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I read so many negative things prior to this album coming out. I have been a Megadeth fan since 83'; I I must say, I don't not see why the complaints on this. It seems to be a quality record in my opinion. I've not listened to it in it's entirety, so I will not review each tune. But from what I've heard, I've got ZERO complaints. You can listen to the samples and make your own judgement, but from what I've heard; it's a VERY GOOD MEGADETH album.
B0082SU98U|3.0|Pretty fast read. Different from the movie but books tend to be different from movies anyway. A geek good book
B00992CF6W|5.0|mcpe is amazing on kindle but takes forever to update when it has updated on everything else PLEASE GET KINDLE THE UPDATE 0.7.1
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King nailed it!  I really, really enjoyed Joyland.  He is back on track and I'm so glad because he is one of my favorite authors.  I have liked some of his more recent books, but the simplicity of this book is really something special.  Thank you Mr. King for a great read!
1932735410|5.0|This book points out many things about the test that I would have never known studying the PMBOK guide.  This puts everything into perspective and helps with self assessment to fill in the gaps.  Very strait forward.  I feel that I am better prepared and more confident about taking the test than after reading the PMBOK guide.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|It doesnt get better then chucky and the best line my name is chucky you wanna play and is the classic
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Perhaps it is because this movie got such rave reviews that I was expecting something different.<br />Don't get me wrong, the acting was great, characters were well developed and there was some spectacular scenes.  It was a very important period in our history but it was just so slow and many of the scenes were dark and it was hard to catch what was being said. I had to keep myself from falling asleep.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Dear Gideon and Eva,<br />You are such a terrific match; I'm so glad you found each other. Watching your relationship develop through three books has mostly been fun. I'll never hear the word \\"Crossfire\\" again without thinking of you. I've enjoyed your angst and endless orgasms even while gritting my teeth over the idiotic behavior of your friends and relatives. But sometimes, even with good things, enough is enough. We are so there.<br />This book could have been your grand finale, but instead, Sylvia Day has decreed that you must slog (and moan) your way through two (TWO!) more books to get to your happy ending. I'm sure some of your fans will continue the journey with you, but I'm done.<br />Have a great life.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is so easy to use and at some point you have to look up a word and the meaning of it.  At least I do and it's right there at your fingertips.  Easy to understand and I find it very useful.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I don't know how to classify this movie, it remind me of No Country for Old Men where all of the characters are just trying to make it to the end and things happen. I thin the beginning is fine, the action and character stories carry you through the middle, if anyone has a problem with this movie it will be the ending.<br />Not every movie has to have a happy ending, but I think people are trying to figure out how the alternatives will work, this one has kind of an ironic twist/die with your boots on kind of thing. Gladiator did it better.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is 2 times better than temple run. Get this app now. This app has all of Tony Starks iron man marks. There cool.
0399213015|4.0|Love the book, so do my kids. It got here in good time. Was a little over the top with packaging and shipping was a bit more than this tiny book would need. Great book though.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|What a awesome game.... I want too see the movie...you will enjoy this and am 42!!<br />Your teenagers will love it also!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Very action packed and a great spin off of firefly. Great story line and good acting. Really enjoyed all of it.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read!  I have read all of the books in the series and I don't know which one is better!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was very interested in the topic but when I finished the book I wanted more so I was kind of left hanging.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I think this is a good and accurate app. It would be better if the ac and usb things worked.Lal lacks kids need and msn xmen and
B003THJA1G|5.0|Awesome show!  Hooked! Bought the second season after plowing through this one in one week end. Worth watching for sure.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Love this series so much.  I am disappointed that I have to wait, yet again for the conclusion of Eva and Gideon, but I'm sure it will be worth the wait.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|Not finished with the second season yet... but just as good if not better than the first.  Worth the time!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME! I`M GOING TO PLAY IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!<br /> I JUST UNLOCKED TRICKY SO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR A LONG TIME!
B000F8O35U|2.0|DVD was scratched and skips many scenes. Plus the \\"coloring\\" was horrible. Don't know how to get ahold of seller because I'm new at this, so I guess I'll take my loss :( Should've waited until it came in stores again.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This is a great app. It's really fun. But my friends that have it on their phones already have the 0.7.1 update with buckets and stuff. The only thing that could make this better is if we could actually have the update so we could do multiplayer games. UPDATE!!! Otherwise, it's awesome.
B000JBWWRY|1.0|Absolutely poor quality. I bought this movie for myself because I love this Disney classic but as bad as this sounds...I'd much rather watched it on tv and record it with a vhs (and I'm actually 28 :/)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A friend of mine, who'd not read any of them, objected because she'd heard that the book killed children. Of course, that's true. In the first book, the moral horror of doing that was not the focus -- it was adventure, the action: An ordinary girl with a bow, the stuff of all so called young adult fiction.  Sure, a background chorus of Good against Evil, but not much more. But this was a writer in transition. The Hunger Games was, as advertised, a young adult book. No offense. There's lots of those and many are truly great for all ages. But Collins was, then, aiming for a younger audience. The second book started getting more serious about how a corrupt and amoral power structure manipulates all of its citizens to maintain ostentatious & extravagant privilege for an elite. Their own 1%.<br /><br />By the third book, Collins breaks into the serious antiwar horror and indiscriminate insanity of war: an Iliad. Gods playing with the lives of humans and, here, children. OK,she's no Homer (and who is?) but that's what she does.<br /><br />Four stars for the first two, five for Mockingjay.<br /><br />Last, a thought on Safe and Sound, with Taylor Swift and The Civil Wars on backup. This collaboration may symbolize the paradox inherent in trying to appeal to two groups: young adults (Taylor Swift, a gifted singer appealing to the young) and The Civil Wars -- a somewhat older, quirky, southern Gothic duo. My preference would have the Civil Wars sing it solo and truly capture, as Conrad had it over a century ago: \\"The horror, the horror.\\"<br /><br />Or (spoiler):<br /><br />\\"For they imagined as they wished--that it was a wild shot,/ an unintended killing--fools, not to comprehend/ they were already in the grip of death./ But glaring under his brows Odysseus answered:<br /><br />'You yellow dogs, you thought I'd never make it/ home from the land of Troy. You took my house to plunder,/ twisted my maids to serve your beds. You dared/ bid for my wife while I was still alive./ Contempt was all you had for the gods who rule wide heaven,/ contempt for what men say of you hereafter./ Your last hour has come. You die in blood.\\"<br />― Homer, The Odyssey<br /><br />Argos (Buttercup): But the moment he sensed Odysseus standing by<br />he thumped his tail, nuzzling low, and his ears dropped,<br />though he had no strength left to drag himself an inch<br />toward his master.<br /><br />...<br /><br />But the dark shadow of death closed down on Argos' eyes<br />the instant he saw Odysseus, twenty years away.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|A great portrayal of the difficult choices and compromises that must be made in order to arrive at history-changing legistation.  Great acting.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|I bought this product hoping it would live up to hype.  I can say it does, I put two coats on my leather motorcycle gloves while using the hair dryer between each coat like they say in the instructions.  After drying the gloves after the second coat, the treated fingers on the gloves allowed me to access both my iPhone and iPad screens without an issue.  The untreated fingers still wouldn't allow access.  Make sure if you are doing leather gloves that you get the 'AnyGlove For Leather', not the 'AnyGlove' product.  Would recommend this product.
B00BWLKTOS|4.0|Have the original The Piano Guys, which i really liked, so this purchase was a natural.  This is another winner which I also like, although it did not strike me as strongly as the original.  Still worthwhile.
B00847KFDS|2.0|If you are a country rock fan, which now means Country fan, you will love this album. For Creedence/Fogerty/Rock fans you will be disappointed. I feel like this is a money grab or a \\"bring John Fogerty back in to the spotlight\\" album. Some manager probably told him he could make money and re-star himself by playing to the Country fan base and this is what he has done. For 40 years John has been rock music but now this album turns all his hits in to Country songs. They are all well done to be sure, but I would have preferred for John to stick to Rock partners like the Foo Fighters instead of going Country. Like I said, Country fans will love this, it's good music. I'm just disappointed he went this route.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|My husband & I both really love the music put out by these guys so yes we are enjoying the album.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|the game is huge but its been a lot of fun and sonl far haw seemed stable which is always good
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Ok read. The 1st 2 books were better! Too much sex & not enough of a story in this book! It seemed to drag a little today!
B00992CF6W|5.0|when will the update for the kindle fire come out for minecraft pe? it is a good game that I play everyday but it needs the update.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Okay game but gets boring after awhile. Update didn't work last time and lost all progress made in the game.  Good mindless game for awhile.
B00D41H2PS|5.0|This has NO HIDDEN OBJECT GAMES! That makes me so happy! This is a true point-and-click game. Taking notes along the way is very important. Mini-puzzles are not difficult,  but are interesting. The graphics were surprisingly good.  I had no glitches on my Kindle 1st generation; just an enjoyable little game.
B0000714BP|5.0|Great storyline, great acting, fun costuming, lots of good morality issues discussed. Fun to see Wesley Snipes and Patrice Swayze in drag!
B0061PEAUY|2.0|I thought the characters were very lame.  Not at all like the TV version.  The whole book was trite.  I can't believe a book like this was turned into a hit TV program.  I won't read any more books by this author.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best written, produced and acted series we have seen. Worth watching from the very first season and episode.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great story lines, great characters, great conflicts, Superb acting, delightful cameos from top-notch actors.  Who can ask for anything more?
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is an historic album because Macklemore & Lewis have broken through the hip hop ceiling by having a deeply meaningful and deeply felt song in support of gay marriage, namely, &#34;Same Love.&#34; There work has an honesty and courage that reflects real human and social needs and rights. Bravo to them!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I loved all of the things that they tied together in this movie.  A great storyline mixed with some retro fun stuff.  Great movie!
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Definitely better than most music today.  Its a great reminder of the past. Does not contain mass produced autotuned dreck fround in todays music.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A frightening glimpse into the dark world of North Korea.  Would seem like the fanciful world of 1984 or Animal Farm,  except it is true - not fabricated.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Lots of great story lines.  Love the map, really helps a 74 year old to play the game.  This got me hooked on hidden object games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Maybe I should hate it.  I'm SO addicted!  I'm getting pretty fast at it, but my wrist is getting sore.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer by John Grisham does not disappoint the reader.  It is wonderfully entertaining as his other works are.  The story keeps you riveted to the book and has an unusual twist that keeps one entranced until the very end of the book.
B004PZ4HC8|3.0|I have a friend who said he prefers to think of the upcoming movie of the same name as \\"The Brad Pitt Zombie Movie.\\" That could be in deference to the source material, or because it's very likely the film will have little to nothing to do with the book. And that's because there is no good way to turn this book into a movie.<br /><br />There are several reasons why this book as-is wouldn't make a good movie, and why the book itself is only so-so. There is no narrative arc. There is no central character. And, most importantly, so much is left up to the reader to decide. Brooks doesn't say how a zombie virus came to be; the reader is left to make that choice. He doesn't detail the ways in which it spread, what the Israelis did to protect themselves, how many people died, how many people survived, who made the decision to use nuclear weapons or how areas outside of North America were affected.<br /><br />There are many memorable and intense passages -- a computer expert escapes from a Kyoto high rise, the American military stages a futile fight against the zombies in New York, a big battle takes place in New Mexico, the Ukranian government bombs a bridge with chemical weapons, a downed pilot escapes zombies through a Louisiana swap -- but as a whole this book is really just a pieced-together assortment of anecdotes. Not terrible, but not great either.
B00CU0UE0E|4.0|This is such a fun album. The first half knocks it out of the park, and only slightly wanes at the end. This is a great summer album, ready to put on repeat at any party, or to get you moving in your workout. I will say \\"Farrah Fawcett Hair\\" is a little...silly. There's a load of funny nostalgia in it, but there's also talking and a super cheesy dance music singer. I can see myself skipping this one a lot. Other than that though, if you like Friendly Fires or Matt & Kim or similar, you'll love this band. They're a bit cheeky, but they're in on the joke.
B003SHDP4K|1.0|\\"Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD listened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought on his name.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|His first books on this saga were more interesting than this fifth book. Too many sub characters and subplots; and, he keeps on adding more. I downloaded the book through kindle. I have read 13% of this book but, it has not yet reached any highs. It has not given me any hard desire to keep on reading. In my opinion, the narrative is too fragmented, and often dull. If I want to start sleeping, only a few pages will do the trick.
068981528X|5.0|I'm replacing a book that &#34;walked&#34; out of my 8th grade classroom.  I've purchased several different versions of the 3 little pigs and versions from around the world and use them in a comparison/contrast unit.  I also do the same with Red Riding Hood.  Can't beat the book prices on Amazon!
B009AP2G26|5.0|But I might be getting tired of the show in another year or so. The music is great and the storyline still entertains
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Captivating story and commentary on morality. Jane Eyre is a powerfully moving walk through the life of a child and woman in mid 19 th century England
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Christoph Fischer<br />Sebastian<br />The Three Nations Trilogy #2<br /><br />I fully enjoyed the first book in this trilogy, but the author has taken this book to a completely new level and I was gripped instantly. The character development is so strong, they all had a place in my heart throughout the book. Incredibly well written, the story flows so smoothly and I never felt lost or wondered what was going on, I just went with it. The historical aspect was always loitering in the background, but was subtle that it didn't feel like a history lesson and just became part of the book. Everyone would take something away from this book, and I highly recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />I received an e-copy from the author in exchange for an honest review.
0765365278|5.0|I bought the paperback book so I could read it again.  It's just as good or better the second time through!
B00CRW2066|5.0|It's a cliche with The National, but more than any previous album this one takes a while to worm its way into your head. But once it does, the chord progressions, the orchestrations, and the lyrics are unforgettable.  Brilliant.
B008602KQI|4.0|Fun, exciting,  the idea  and the dynamics are interesting.  The killing is not portrayed in a bloody or sick manner
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game is amazing. The gas yea in Vietnam war against the true king and fleshflesh and south Korea has a c and fleshflesh to the thro and flesh out of thrones<br />Met my mom love 'll 'll army Qatar
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I bought this with the new 30 Seconds to Mars, who I profess a deep obsession with. Guess which one I'm wearing out.<br />I can't get enough of this CD. I knew several of the popular songs, but the entire CD is that good! My favorite at the moment is actually Bleeding Out. Partly b/c it sounds as if written as soundtrack to my second novel. Mostly because it's powerfully moving.
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|A Good Day To Die Hard, despite it's flaws, is not only a good movie but a good die hard movie. I don't understand the hate it gets. What really perplexes me is when people compare it to Olympus Has Fallen. I see so many claiming that Olympus has fallen is more Die Hard than this film. That is so untrue. Die Hard films are nowhere near as melodramatic and patriotic as Olympus. Don't get me wrong, Olympus is a good movie, but for different reasons. I think people's memories of the original 3 are a little skewed to be honest. As for being the most unrealistic in the series, Live Free is still #1 when it comes to being unrealistic. All 5 are.<br /><br />John McClane is still John McClane. He isn't in his mid 30s anymore. He's over 55 and his whole outlook on life is different now. He's not going act as he did more than 20 years ago, though parts of his old personality still shine through. Jack McClane is very much like a young John. Not quite hardened by experience, yet. Years of fighting trained professional terrorists will change you; another unrealistic aspect of the series. A Good Day has enough in it to keep anyone with realistic expectations glued to their seats. Lots of twists you don't see coming. The plot is pretty straight forward like the other 4 Die Hards. This time John McClane has to stop some russians from obtaining some items that, in their hands, will likely start a third World War. Another complaint people make about the film was the way it was shot. The shaky cam and slow motion isn't new to the Die Hard series, but it is a bit excessive here. I did like the look of the film, though. Looks especially good on bluray. The picture is colorful, grainy, sharp and gives A Good Day a really gritty look. This wasn't filmed in the traditional anamorphic 2.35:1 aspect ratio of the series. Those films had a lot of steady shots and stylized angles. Live Free was shot on Super 35 and cropped to 2.35:1.<br /><br />*SPOILERS* The ending could've been better; it wasa little abrupt. They just killed the bad guys and walked away. I would've liked to see Holly greet John and Jack when they returned home. With the Extended Cut (101 minutes), they made some improvements. They completely cut out Lucy McClane and put in extra footage that helped expand on John and Jacks relationship. This is very much a father and son movie and this extended cut does strengthen the film.<br /><br />So going into this for the 1st time, I did expect it to be much better than it was, but it was still a good movie. It entertained me, the story intrigued me and I cared about the characters. Those are the elements that make a movie good.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|when I downloaded this game I was so happy that they made a tf2 clone for the fire/android, but as I later found out I could not get past the game because of the choose a name not letting me choose a name.... I tried all kinds of names but I still could not get in
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|My review is for the theatrical version of the film and not the blu-ray with any added material. If you are a fan of the original Evil Dead, Evil Dead II or Army of Darkness films then you will be very disappointed with this one. This isn't a remake or continuation of the original campy horror flicks. It is a total departure from the fun over-the-top originals. The content is sick. The film is awful and or lack of a better word, it was just plain putrid...
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love this one it's colorful. Constant YOU don't really need any friends to help you collect the items you need for the upgrades of certain things.  It's easy yes challenging.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It's really good to know how much Battery life you have left. Very useful! Love it! Can't wait to show my friends!
193700788X|4.0|I have been a fan of the Sookie series for a few years now.  The ending was about what I was expecting.  This book was not as good as some of the earlier books in the series but I still enjoyed it.
0425263924|5.0|I was immediately drawn back into Eva and Gideon's world and I so enjoyed every minute.<br />I am glad to know there are two more books coming so I can continue to enjoy their journey.<br />Curious to see were all the subplots are going.<br />It's been a fantastic reading experience.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so much fun because it is like there are a bunch of little mini games in a big app. Try it out because your really going to love it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Very good way to end things. Sookie and. Sam together at last.  Claude ugly is very appropriate way to end his existence.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Should be required reading. A very important book. It is a blueprint for the changes we need to make in our society.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I had played other hidden object games, and this one is definitely the best! It takes a little getting used to...esp. finding only parts of objects rather than the whole thing. But I really love the different levels and different puzzles. Plus not getting bored with looking for the same things over and over is the best.
B00899F0G8|5.0|So addicting! Had to watch the last few episodes online before season four starts. Great quality stream from the website.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Highly Recommend. A true to life look at Bipolar Disorder.<br />Bradley Cooper gives a wonderful , true-to-life performance, and Jennifer Lawrence gives an Academy Award Winning Performance in this touching story of mental illness and just plain life. Robert De Niro is also great as Bradley Cooper's father.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You got to have this game . There is there is no finish  lime you just keeps going until you beat your high score or get caught . This game is so much fun . You got to get.  GET IT NOWWWWWWWW!!!!! !
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a great calculator that is big and easy to use. I also like the previous calculation view and easy tipping. I just don't like the font.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|There needs to be a quick reference key.  Too many symbols to remember.  It is fun to play.  Some of the goals are not associated with the game.  Stars are impossible to get and you really need them so, if you purchase stars then the game isn't free.  Making friends is easy, thank you for that.
0679805273|5.0|Great price and convenient!  My preschool class thoroughly enjoyed receiving this as a gift.  Teachers each year can now write in it about their experience that year.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|So obviously the reason I went to go see this movie in the first place was because of Jeremy Renner. He's one of my favorite actors. Gemma is amazing too. Well I saw previews for the movie and it looked really good. I'm an action junky, so figured it would be perfect for me, and man was I right. I hate seeing all the negative reviews about it. Yes, it's not like the fairy tale, but that didn't bother me. I just love how bad ass they turned out after everything they had been through. Plus, getting to see Jeremy shirtless was a plus. If you're a fan of guts, gore, and action, this is the movie for you. Don't listen to all the nay sayers...this movie is a must see!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I love everything about it! The graphics and the mystery are so good. It definitely keeps you guessing you guessing the whole way through.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I love this movie so much! Such a good Christmas movie for all ages to enjoy! One of my favorites!
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|THE BEST MUSIC APP EVER!!!! The abillity to mix the songs is the bomb no bugs and you can go and share it online.XD
B001NCKPV8|5.0|i think that sunshine of your love has that guitar riff and bass line that people remember when u say to a person remember that song
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have all three of the cut the rope games and love them all. It is really additive! I also like that they add new levels frequently, that way if you finish the game you can have new levels soon.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't get this. I can't find any way to update this to 0.7.1!  How do you update things for minecraft on kindle fire?!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book starts off well.  It feels very sadly, familiar in this day and time...and then, just as I was getting a little fidgety, feeling that we have been down this road.. all bets are off, and we are on a winding, twisty, turning road into a territory that is uncharted!  I couldn't put it down until I had reached the end!  A very satisfying read.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it wont update!!!! I want all my buckets and cakes and stuff. I reset my kindle it didn't update!!!! but I love the game. my fav game ever!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game dooooo much I am trying to get Lucy she looks like she would not be that Bad but
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is totally amazing. Not all players have gotten to this point yet but there is actually a mine where you can go in a cart. Difficult but fun. Also there is more new things like the zip line. I think everyone in the world would enjoy this app (including moi!)
B003I55BIA|5.0|Really good I don't usually read book but I finished I three day. It was really good and I plan on reading the next two.
0930289234|5.0|I ordered this for my boyfriend to read because I think everyone should read this!  It's so intense, the film adaptation was fine but the book captures so much more of the conflicts of the leading characters.  This book should be assigned in schools.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I do not have showtime on my tv so i bought my kindle so i could see dexter  but now i watch everything
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Extremely well written, wonderfully cast, interwoven sub-plots, comically quirky, just a dash of sexuality (Sigourney Weaver rocks!), and enough gore for the gore mongers but not enough to really offend. A very creative endeavour and a really fun watch. Keep a copy on the shelf and if you're not watching it again two months from now, someone else will be. I say we need a Galaxy Quest II!
B000T0XEGS|5.0|Ms. Stratas has a beautiful voice, and Placido Domingo is, as usual, his magnificent self. There is no better composer of opera than Verdi.
B0079LJZG8|2.0|Gary Oldman, one of the most versatile, dynamic and expressive actors of our time, demonstrates the depth of his acting skill by portraying the flattest, dullest, grayest, and least engaging lead character in recent cinema history. Watching this film is truly like watching paint dry. Not recommended. At all.
B00BY8DNK6|5.0|This is the cd that the record company should have released back in 86. Dio and the band at their best! there will never be another voice like Ronnie!  Long live rock n roll and DIO!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it!  I used it for the first time when I received my new Kindle Fire and I'm still learning how to use it.
B00AIBZM40|3.0|I liked the (minimal) originality, plot, and the acting was great, especially by the eldest little girl.<br />I would've rated it 4 stars; but the ending sucked beyond belief.<br />I'm not looking for \\"happy endings\\" and all that -- Just endings that fit the story-line, while making sense... And this one didn't do either.  (which had me pondering a 2 star rating; but settled on 3)<br /><br />The ghost (\\"Mama\\") has no problem killing adults, until the end... All of a sudden, her magic killer powers are only at half strength for some reason; and despite numerous times of trying to kill the man, & \\"put her (Chastain) to sleep\\", fails. __ Add to this, the concept developed during the movie: \\"the ghost will remain until the wrong is put right\\"... goes completely out the window; and the ghost does the exact same \\"wrong\\" -- but still \\"dies\\" (or whatever) and is \\"at peace\\".<br /><br />So... Sucky, sucky ending... Which made an otherwise enjoyable movie which I would've bought, a \\"straight back to NetFlix, while thanking God I'm a member & didn't pay $25 for this!\\" movie.... But I digress...<br /><br />Why bother putting all that content &/or back-story in the movie, if you're going to completely ignore it in the last 5 minutes!??<br />So not only does it not \\"pay-off\\" -- it ends up making absolutely NO sense... Unless of course, you're just one of those people who enjoy the pretty colors &/or scary images; and pay no attention to the plot/story/etc... Well, as evidenced by a lot of the reviews here, you'll think the ending was cool.<br /><br />The originality pretty much begins and ends with the design of the ghost's look, and the reason behind it -- But I guess it was just really, really nice, not seeing the same old, non-descrip \\"ghost\\" & \\"haunting-movie\\", so hats off for at least being that original... even though the idiot, \\"writer-director\\", completely dropped the ball at the end -- or -- couldn't think of a better way to get to the ending he desired, so he copped-out& hoped no one would notice.<br /><br />If I had 1 Dollar for every time a good movie was ruined by a horrible ending, I'd have enough money to make my own movie... which, I'd of course, ruin the ending on, in an attempt to be ironic, while allowing my own, to start my next \\"1 Dollar for every time\\" movie-fund.  LOL
B009R659L8|5.0|I've read her books since she started writing.  I think this is her best book, very well done.<br />My father was her accountant way back in the 1960's and that's when we started knowing her work.<br />Buy the book and read it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Very clear graphics and great board challenges. I've looked,bought, and downloaded  many a game only to delete it once i tried to play it. Superb!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Always enjoy the story line of this series. These characters are priceless. The every day workplace should be so engaging.  It makes me smile.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Just recently put this in a laptop that was long overdue for new thermal compound.  Lowered my temps when gaming ~8-10 degrees compared to what the manufacturer had in there.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love it  because you can actually have several locations set up for easy viewing. I don't know what else to say.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book. I would recommend it to anyone.<br />Better than the movie. Really good reading. Enjoyed it lots.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I loved it lots of answers were finally given in this novel. SPOILER ALERT: This story ends a major thread that has been woven through all the other novels the fall of silence. I can't wait to see how Singh cleans up the PsyNet. My only complaint- This book would have been perfect if Sienna and Hawke had been in it. In my opinion, this is second best book of the entire series, the best is Kiss of Snow. The entire series is a great read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this app! We have the best time playing together. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loves horses :)
B007HO392S|5.0|Shes a great artist and I am sure she will be around for years to come. Yea!!! for Carrie and her talent
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's a great game I like all the different types of mini games it has<br />And that you can get new games just by playing
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love it!  It helps me to stay in touch with family [especially those living out of state] and friends.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent trilogy<br />Ending was a little strange<br />Hope there will be more to follow. Can't wait for the movie. I would highly recommend this series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started a little slow for me and I put it aside for a while. I am happy I decided to pick it up again and finish.  Clever twists and turns. A good psychological study
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am certainly glad I didn't read the reviews before buying and bought on the release date as a true fan would. I anxiously counted the days until the release and as before Sylvia did not disappoint.  I am still utterly swept up in the whole Gideon/Eva storm.  I wont give away any information other than I was captivated by the realness of these characters.  I am soooooo looking forward to the next chapter and am thrilled to have their saga continue.  True fans will agree that three books aren't enough to fully explore the relationship and outcome of these spellbinding characters.  Hurry Sylvia and give a release date for book four.....I need something to look forward to!!!!!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|First time I heard her sing it engulfed me. Since then I have appreciated her music and will if she keeps making music like this.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|One of the greatest documentary movies ever made.  This version includes other performances that didn't make the 1970 movie, including Jefferson Airplane.  It's a great period piece with some of the greatest performances ever made, including the introduction of Joe Cocker to America plus first live play by Crosby Stills & Nash.  Highlights include The Who, Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix's Star Spangled Banner.
141659521X|4.0|Mitch didn't,t seem to have much energy in this book, did a lot of talking.  Worth reading if you are a fan
1444737112|5.0|So glad Bob found a happy home after being alone on the street.  I urge others to make happy homes for strays!  The return on your investment is inarticulate.
0316247545|5.0|I am a recent fan of the show, and I was pleased to see such a concise and well presented guide to all things Equestria available at a very reasonable price.  I have had the book for a couple of days, so this review comes after reading a significant portion of the book, and I assume the rest will be as good.  Character information, episode guide (beware of spoilers if you haven't watched all the shows), lyrics to all the songs from the episodes (they should work on a music release), location info and all presented with great pictures from the show.  Also notable is the extent of the design and art development materials and info directly from the series' creators.  This is a great book for children and older fans alike, and it scores high on the awesomeness, coolness and radicalness scales.<br /><br />Note: I pre-ordered the book and received it at a significant discount from cover-price thanks to Amazon's \\"lowest price\\" pre-order policy, which is worth looking into for pre-order items.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is, so far, a fun and enjoyable game. Not experienced any glitches or harping to use real money to buy stuff yet.
6305128952|5.0|The movie itself is what drew my attention to the natural horsemanship world over the conventional methods. The book and the movie have lead to me to trainers such as Buck Brannahman, Pat Parelli, John Lyons and Mark Rashid
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a very nice app that has worked smoothly so far. It handily provides remaining usage times for other apps that are running. One of my favorite features is the audio update on remaining battery time- very handy when you're reading since the battery display is not visible then.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great game just like bthe first  and always challenging and their is so much stuff to get in the game as well
B0079J28NC|5.0|trip through the surreal world of &#34;The Beatles&#34; with this quirky animated feature! Fantastic artwork from the UK and some of our favorite songs, this is a great movie! There's even some socio-political issues addressed, if you know what you're looking for! Good fun!
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|Download took forever and when I tried to open the game to try it out, got \\"internal error message\\"...anyone else have have this problem?
B008OM0EDO|3.0|This is movie is good no bad some times is bored but is good recommended for a good time tanks
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a great game and all, but I would like some more content in the game, if you've played minecraft pc or xbox edition this might get boring as the content is low. Please add more content! I would love it!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson is the bomb!  Every song on here is awesome, except maybe &#34;i'll be Home for Christmas&#34; which seems out of place on a Greatest Hits CD.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun and educational. My son really likes the bright colors,and the fact that you can put whatever you like anywhere you want.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is a Must have for any Pink Floyd Fan. The &#34;PULSE&#34; tour was one of the largest in the history of Rock.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Having lived in Newton it was &#34;fun&#34; for us to visualize where some scenes were taking place.  It was a great book but the plot twist was a letdown.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have minecraft pocket eddition in my ipod and in the kindle fire and in my ipod i have 0.7.0 when do Amazon is going to the update to 0.7.0.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My granddaughter sat thru it. Which is unusual. She nerver sit thru anything longer then 25 mins. Also wanted to watch over and over.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Great story and actors...a bit much realistic violence!  Can't wait till next season!  I'll be watching!  Whoever did the casting did a fabulous job!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I'm very happy with my purchase. Im sad that there will be not be a continuation, but I am also happy that I can come up with my own conclusion as to the future for Sookie and her friends and its a happy life. Thank you Charlaine Harris for creating this wonderful world to get lost in. I am and will remain a fan of everything Charlaine Harris.
0783226845|5.0|Quite possibly the best work of Al Pacino ever. A Must see / Must own movie. Truly fantastic, will keep you on your toes and maybe even cry a bit.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|His voice has got even better with age, however i thought it was a bit monotonous at times, he may have lost his range a bit over the years, thats my only criticism. I would still definitely recommend it.
0739432141|4.0|The world that Morgan has created is so detailed, full and rich, that it felt real, relatable and intriguing at the same time.  You dive right in to this new reality without much explanation so you're learning about this place as well as following Kovacs as he moves through the story.<br /><br />I found the premise of the book interesting and it kept me thinking after I'd finished it. The idea that you could take all of the data from your brain, knowledge, memories, etc and essentially upload it to another body and continue living, potentially forever, really made me think about what it means to be alive, and our perception of self.
B00BESLT6G|3.0|The same line of the first so nothing new. Need more jump out and scare you stuff. Would not watch again.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie go see it.  This is one of those movies that you will watch over and over, watch it at least 15 times
B00AIGQTEC|5.0|I feel this should have been released in the summer instead of winter because its perfect for cruising with the top down,and it should be a huge hit .Prince however refuses to promote anything and very little of the world will get the chance to hear this perfect pop gem.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law team up once more to battle the &#34;forces&#34; of Evil in the second installment of Guy Ritches' &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34;.<br />A Far cry from proper Victorian London, Guy puts his own &#34;steampunk&#34; twist on the characters and story.<br />Though heavily reliant on stop motion, it doesn't feel as 'newborn' as his first effort, delving deeper into Holmes' drug problems and manic episodes.
B000F8O35U|2.0|The quality of the picture is absolutely horrible. The sound is very low. My VHS played better than the DVD. I highly regret paying $34.99 for this movie. I would not suggest buying this item to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this game is fun it is awesome it is worth buying it is super fun for all ages and kid appropriate. I say u should buy thisgame u will love it. PRESS THE BUTTON PRESS THE BUTTON! !!!!!! ITSA GAME THAT IS AWESOME, EPIC, RADICAL,AND JUST BREATH TACKING!!!!!!!!!! PRESS THE BUTTON! !!!!!!!!!! LOL XD
B00COHAUD4|4.0|The movies was good but the kids made it better. Ending supprised me though. Would watch it again. Good twist.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is so addictive, that my husband has to share the tablet with me in order to play along! Very devious puzzles, very mind-provoking!
B003DZX3SA|4.0|The amazon description clearly states that there is a French audio track. I bought the DVD with the intention of showing it in French as part of our language lessons. What a disappointment to receive it and learn that only Canadian DVDs included the French track. The only options for my disc were English and Spanish.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|There will never be another toy story like this one. This will go down in history as a classic. A movie I will love and I look forward to watching it with my daughter when she is old enough to enjoy it as well.
0316227706|5.0|I purchased this book for my husband and he adores it. The photos are of several different breeds and mixes of dogs, all having a great time playing in the water.  My husband gets a kick out of it everytime he flips through the pages.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|This movie is great! And even though it's about vampires and werewolves it's not a sparkling vampire movie. Which is good. It's dark and it has a great plot in my opinion. Must see.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|no plot.  lots of secondary character development that has no impact on gideon and eva's story.  does not resolve anything from the second book; you probably could skip this and #4 to really get to the end.  huge disappointment.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I wish Ms. Day would have finished at least one story line before opening 20 more. I did feel like this booked was following in Grey's foot steps and maybe that is why 2 more books have been added to the series. The step brother is dead she could have just ended that and moved on, it's not like there isn't enough drama to move it along. However, now somehow the Russian mob is involved someone else is covering up, the receptionist seems to be MIA, Cary maybe having a baby and there is some kinda drama with her mom's money. While 2 more books will be fun reads it will be hard to pick up the next book. When I finished I though well that was a waste. I would recommend waiting to buying this book until the next one comes out when ever that might be. At least then you won't feel hung out to dry with this non ending.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|If you're determined to beat 'him' try authors - that's where I beat 'him' the most.  People I thought fairly obscure were guessed with amazing regularity, sometimes without even a second round of questions.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This was a great movie and always will be. I think it both interesting and creative how they have spun from this movie to create other equally great films. Amazing story line and amazing writers.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It's a lot of fun to play. As much fun as playing on my home computer but much more manageable on my kindle. Boards are challenging and lots of fun.
1592402038|4.0|I read part of this years ago and really enjoyed it. I've been writing a lot of papers at school and this has actually helped with my punctuation and it was a fun read. I want to get the child's version for my son
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love the game but it freezes ALL the time.I would also like to get a higher number of daily rewards.
B00CW665VI|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK. It was written from a male POV. So freaking funny and witty. Down right enjoyable. I was sad :( that the book was over but can not wait for book 2. Excellent job Emma Chase. Nice debut novel. You have a new fan.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I just began reading this book a few days ago and I am excitedly laughing out loud with tears in my eyes.  I'm remembering some of the talks my husband and I have had over the years about his days as a Boy Scout and I am wrapped up in another good read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing it keeps me entertens me for hours on end I love this game there is nothing wrong with this game
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Being a small child and going through things similar to what Charlie went through, this book means a lot to me. Going through life with an  underlying pain that you can never explain until you become  an adult is hard. To me it's unexplainable but this book puts it in perspective why I am the way that I am sometimes. Although I feel that I've grown from my experience I feel even more free knowing Charlie's story. What an amazing, emotional story.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|Today's free app of the day for June 7, 2013 is Battery Pro from MacroPinch.  This is one of those apps that seems like it should have been a 5 star app but in reality it disappoints which is why I am going to explain why I am giving this only 3 out of 5 stars in detail below.<br /><br />Yes, this app can be useful in telling you about your battery usage on an android device.  But the main problem I have is a message that pops up after a short period of time after opening it.  The message is \\"Rate Battery.  Do you like Battery?  Would you give your 5-star rating to help us make the app even better?\\"<br /><br />So I am reading that thinking how giving MacroPinch a 5 star rating is going to improve the app.  Does that mean that they are only interested in improving their app if everyone gives them a thumbs up approval?  That doesn't seem right.  Did the Wright Brothers improve flight by getting approval from beginner level pilots?  Innovation is what makes apps better, not positive feedback saying that the app is great.<br /><br />But even if the app developer's request for their users to leave a 5 star app to improve the app hadn't existed, this is probably not quite a 5 star app since they did not really implement a user's guide to help you understand how to use this app to its maximum potential.<br /><br />I want to apologize to many of the 5 star reviewers in advance.  I found that most of the 5 star reviews of this app to be of little value.  Most of them state that they love it, or that it is good, or it is simple to check the battery level, but very few seem to point out a single thing that makes this battery app stand out from others such as the ability to show how much battery power is used for a specific thing such as the screen lighting.  This proves my point above that many users can use this app but are not able to use it to its maximum potential.<br /><br />Because of the app developer's lack of innovation and lack of explaining how to get the most out of their app, I have to give this the 3 stars out of 5 rating I mentioned above.
B0047BXRB2|5.0|What a classic Sci-Fi picture!  The special effects, for the 1950's time period, are stunning.  They still hold up pretty well by even today's standards.  Great story line and the drama/suspense is well developed.  Some of the acting is a little cheesy at points, but for the most part well done.  Walter Pidgeion nails his role to perfection!  I remember seeing this movie as a little boy.  I had to have a Robby the Robot toy the minute they came out.  The creature stalking the planet kept me awake at night for a week.  I view this movie and the 1953 release of War of the Worlds as true landmarks in the science fiction genre of movies.  Most science fiction pictures from this era were black and white, B grade and lower, with little budgets and poor to even laughable special effects or monsters.  These two films pushed the quality bar way up and proved you could make a decent science fiction movie on par with other films from that time period.  A MUST HAVE for any science fiction movie buff.  There has been talk for many years of Hollywood doing a remake.  If it is remade, they will need to bring their \\"A\\" game, because the original still holds up very well.
B00992CF6W|4.0|v.6 needs a bigger update to add all the things Pc has I mean it said build on the go should it should be like the Pc edition except the name is minecraft pe thanks for understanding
B006QVRVJK|5.0|Wow, I never EVER would have guessed that Carnage would be as good as it was.  The first 10 minutes didn't really indicate which direction this movie was going until I stuck with it for a while.  Reading the description does NOT reveal exactly what kind of movie this is.  Please keep this in mind.<br /><br />It's NOT some family-friendly typically outrageous Disney-like adventure about two parents that get into a fight over who's really responsible for the son of Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly getting his mouth busted up as a result of a fight with another kid.  The movie description makes it seem like it very well *could* have been, however.  So what does Jodie and John's characters do?<br /><br />They invite the parents over (played by Kate Winslet and Christopher Waltz) to try and figure out what exactly happened involving Jodie and John's child losing a couple teeth, and what to do about it.  Are they going to discuss and figure out things like rational adults?  Maybe for a while, however... this is where the darkness of the comedy comes in.  Gradually- very slowly and precisely using clever words as a way to get in little digs and insults so to speak- the storyline unravels until the four parents eventually explode into several different types of emotions.<br /><br />However the unique thing about the concept is that, there's a feeling of believability to the whole thing.  It seems entirely realistic that Jodie and John's characters would invite the parents over to have a rational conversation as a way to sort out what actually happened.  It seems realistic that emotions would change -and that the friendly tone would suddenly disappear in a hurry- depending on the way the other parents interpret and defend the actions of their child.<br /><br />But... the movie writers take it a step further just to put the icing on this already well-written and delicious cake.  Whenever Jodie starts getting angry, her husband is always there to calm her down.  Whenever John gets out of line, Jodie is there to calm him down.  The same situation applies to Kate and Christopher's wife and husband characters.  This is EXACTLY what couples do, and the portrayal is really accurate in this movie.  Job well done there.  Both parents are simply defending their child's actions but *nobody* wants to lose their cool (well, not at first anyway).<br /><br />SO many outrageous accusations and events take place through this relatively short 80-minute movie, that you really have to stick with it to discover all the nooks and crannies.  There's a lot of depth to the development of the characters and the emotions they reveal.  Really rewarding movie in my opinion.<br /><br />The ending... oh boy the ending (during the credits I mean).  Well there's probably at least two ways to interpret it, though I strongly believe I know which one the writers were going for.  I won't spoil it though.  It's too much information at once.  I'm too much of a nice guy for that!<br /><br />Another thing I find unintentionally hilarious is how Kate Winslet and Christopher Waltz constantly try to rationalize their sons uncontrollable and angry behavior claiming that \\"boys will be boys\\" and he couldn't (can't) help his actions.  Also that kids at that age will be violent due to not knowing any better, so there's really no way to avoid it.  While plausible that kids may be violent sometimes, I believe their logic is wrong compared to Jodie Foster's at least (who believes such behavior is unacceptable and that her son wasn't able to defend himself from a smack against his face).  In today's world, that would clearly indicate bullying was in effect so Kate and Christopher's child would take the blame.<br /><br />Overall, wonderful movie on ALL counts.  Amazing that the entire film takes place inside a small apartment room and yet, it never feels like it should branch out to other settings due to the storyline being fully developed right there.  It never needed to.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I have always used google search and was so happy I could download it to my new Kindle Fire. Amazing!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I am so dissapointed with the way this book has ended that I have taken the time to write my first review on amazon. I am a fan of Sylvia Day and a feen for Gideon Cross and Eva's drama filled fantasy, but this last book just didn't do it for me! Yes, the sex was just as amazing as always! they're obsession with eachother only becomes worse as you read on, but as far as their demons and alterations throughout the books Sylvia handed us nothing, but cliff hangers all through out book three! There is not one issue this couple has had that I can honestly tell you we've gotten answers for! I can see where fans love the fact that their story will continue i'm all for it because im just as obsessed with these two as the rest of you, but give me a break... I have nothing to look forward to except more sex and the same exact issues that were left unsettled in books one AND two with the addition of all the new issues Eva's managed to pile up throughout book three!<br /><br />So if you like cliff hangers and unsolved mysteries go on and purchase book three now! If not my advise is you wait for book four and read them together, that way maybe if Sylvia is feeling generous we'll have some answers and you won't feel as dissapointed as most of her fans currently feel!
B00AF46Q5Y|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a story teller and that's just what you get in this book. This is a great story. OK, the characters may not be greatly developed, but who cares. What Archer gives you are those ah-ha moments. And, he really good at it. His books always remind me of a modern Charles Dickens. Just like those people who waited at the American docks for the next installment of Dickens to arrive via ship to see what happened to Little Nell, Archer manages that same anticipation at the end of his chapters.<br /><br />If you loved this book as I did, you'll want to read book one and three of the Clifton Chronicles, too.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|HIS VOICE IS TO DIE FOR. HE MAKES YOU RRELAXED AND I JUST LOVE LISTENING TO HIS VOICE. HE IS AMAZING. LOVE YOU DAVID COOK
B00D2K40WY|5.0|fun and imaginative little game. i could play for hours. fun to mix and match all the makeup and hair colors.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final was everything I'd hoped for. The story was deep and different. The message unforgettable even more because of the impossibility.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|[UPDATE: Returning three weeks later, I discovered a *FLOOD* of fake/solicited 5-star reviews!  I must assume the developer, either in-app or externally, or both, created, concocted, solicited, or 'forced' the hundreds of 5-star reviews that appeared after the app was the Free App of the Day.  So this app went from 3-stars to 1-star for developer shenanigans!]<br /><br />WHY does this app need internet access??  There is NOTHING in the app that requires this, unless it needs it for the \\"More Apps\\" screen where you can buy its Weather Pro software. That doesn't make sense, though, because it launches another software to reach the internet or the app store. So, again, WHY does this app need internet access?<br /><br />As far as the app's performance goes, there's nothing special here.  The battery \\"usage\\" simply takes me to the devices built-in utilization information.<br /><br />On the other hand, the amount of 'time remaining' doesn't add up.  When I started the app, my batter on my 10.1\\" Samsung Note was at 73% (already indicated in the notifications area) which would last more than a day on standby.  Yet the app said I had 29 minutes left.  Coming back to the app after a few minutes, the time now says 9 hours and 1 minute left at 72%.  Still daft.<br /><br />While this app really is pretty, there's nothing here that my OS already has built-in.  Furthermore, the free app ZDBox does this and a whole lot more, both regarding the battery and other essential functions.<br /><br />Even free, this doesn't seem worthwhile to have in my library.  Out of 5 stars, it lost 2 stars for idiotic internet access permission and for wacky statistics regarding the time left.  At least it's attractive.
B002ZBRSIY|4.0|I liked but the firstone was the best \\"for me\\" any way I remonend this movie because have fun, accction and my favorite actor \\"George Clooney\\" :)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoyed this book.I don't understand why all the bad reviews.I cant wait untill the fourth book comes out and possibly the fifth.I love to read and I love this story so if there are more books that means I can continue to enjoy the story even longer.Great job Sylvia Day
B004EBT5CU|5.0|THIS CD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CDS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME. I LOVE IT. LORI E FROM TEXAS
1596177373|5.0|My friend loved them! When I got them, I had to resist the urge to open them and take a peek for myself. The art on each card is very nice and detailed... Very Tim Burton like.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have been reading over the reviews and feel that a lot of people are just not being fair.  I will say that Yes I was disappointed when I found out there was going to be 2 more book  to the series but, this one did not leave me with a cliffhanger only lots of unanswered questions, which I can live with.  I love Gideon and Eva.  In this one you saw more of what makes Gideon Gideon and the dynamics of hos relationship with Eva.  I will continue to read the series regardless if it is 2 or 5 more books.  I am very glad that Sylvia posted on facebook exactly happened and why.  I would still recommend this series to anyone out there to read.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Unexpected ending. Very anticlimactic.  Good story up until last chapter or two.  No rhyme or reason as to why what was done was done.
B00D41AJ7G|1.0|This ia a cool idea but this app only lasts 30 minutes at best. I finished all 44 levels, if u can even call them that, in a matter of minutes. What did i just pay for? An overpriced DEMO!<br />With so many free apps available that last days sometimes week, i am upset i wasted $ on this ridiculously short game. Its also extemely simple, my 7 year old would be bored.<br />No Replay Value Whatsoever!! For what you get I suggest you not waste your time, money, or space on this game.<br />Since it has potential, I might increase my rating to 4-5 stars if Bart Bonte increases the difficulty and adds a ton more levels. Until then its a huge disappointment!
030789701X|5.0|This is one of those books where it is nice to own it in a hardback because it is massive! The pages are slightly thin (thankfully so because the book is huge!) but glossy and jam-packed with an insane amount of info on all things Skyrim. Someone mentioned the cover seemed cheap but it was what I had expected and to be honest, I could care less because its content will get you your money's worth and then some. It expands upon the previous edition to include the expansion packs that are included in the legendary edition which comes out soon or can be purchased online if you own the standard edition. It comes with:<br /><br />-A giant pullout map of locations -- their place on the map and an index to the right so they can be found easily<br />-Poster with the \\"signatures\\" of everyone who worked on the game<br />-A card with a code so that you can access an interactive map online<br />-An attached ribbon to keep your place<br /><br />The book itself Is filled with thousands of details and pictures which document every single aspect of the game in order to allow you to get the most out of each quest and build the best character for your play-style. Chapters are organized under the following headers:<br /><br />  -TRAINING: Covers character creation, skills per play style, perks, shouting, diseases, vampirism, lycanthropy, alchemy, smithing, enchanting and information about the world and how to interact with it: crime and punishment, horses, books etc. This list is not all-inclusive.<br />  -THE INVENTORY: Info regarding inventory categories<br />  -THE BESTIARY: Advice, information and pictures of the enemies encountered in the game<br />  -QUESTS: includes Main quests, Companions quests, College of Winterhold quests, Theives guild quests, Dark Brotherhood quests, Civil war quests, Daedric quests, other factions quests (Greybeards, blades, bards college, temple quests, etc), side quests, dungeon quests, favors and miscellaneous quests. I should also mention that all radiant quests are included<br />  -DAWNGUARD QUESTS: Vampire/character/location overview, main quests, postquest activities, dawnsguard faction quests, vampire faction quests, side quests and regional activities.<br />  -DRAGONBORN QUESTS: Overview characters/locations, Dragonborn main quests, Solesteim side quests, regional activties and world interactions.<br />  -THE ATLAS OF SKYRIM: Overview of northern lands of Tamriel, Additional locations, Dawnguard services, crafting and collectibles, hold 1: Haafingar, hold 2: Hjaalmarch, hold 3: The pale, Hold 4: Winterhold, hold 5:The Reach, hold 6: Whiterun, hold 7: Eastmarch, hold 8: Falkreath, hold 9: The Rift, Blackreach and other realms, Solshteim: northern mountains and southern ashlands, and Apocrypha. The mapping of these locations is extensive--where everything in a village is located, traps at quest locations, covetable items, etc.<br />  -APPENDICES: achievements and Trophies, Traders, Shrines, Unique Weapons, Unique Armor and Items, Skill books, other references, and the language of dragons<br /><br />Hopefully, this has helped provide some insight into what is included in the book. You will not regret buying it!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|DAVID CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU.... YOU ARE AMAZING AND ANYTHING YOU EVER PUT OUT WILL BE A PURCHASE ANYONE WILL HAVE NO REGRETS IN DOING.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|and it was a really fun read.  I bought the series and have enjoyed them all.  When is the next one coming out?
B00CE004XM|5.0|This is the &#34;match made in heaven&#34;... one kick-ass (male) guitarist paired up with one kick-ass (female) vocalist on the Blues/Rock Scene bringing everything they've got onto one album. It doesn't get much better than this other than having them over to your house for an intimate concert!!!  These two artists bring exactly what today's music is missing... HEART & SOUL.
B005LA3Z9M|3.0|Nicely balanced, well written, flows at a nice pace, a great holiday read. Absolutely nothing to take offence at and very pleasant decoding the Victorian meanings of flowers.
B0053B347M|5.0|Excellent product. I don't know the exact date I purchased this LED kit but it was easily 6 months ago. The lights are just as bright as they were the day I bought them. The adhesive on the back has not wavered once.<br /><br />The only part of the product that has started to show some wear and tear would be the on/off switch. I have wrapped this cord to the side of my monitor, using a bit of adhesive. When I turn on/off the strip I use one hand and this tugs at the connection between the wire and the switch. The other day the light started to flicker and I noticed the cord had pulled its self out of the housing. I pushed the cord back in to the housing and no more flickering... but it is a bit disconcerting.<br /><br />That being said, when the LED's finally give out on this product I will buy this same product again. A great way to add backlight behind your monitor and ease your eyes a bit in dark rooms.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Very good lineup of Stevie's best hits. Only wish &#34;Ebony & Ivory&#34; & &#34;Ribbon in the Sky&#34; were included but I gave it 5 stars for quality!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is perfect for minecraft enthusiasts and minecraft beginners I love it. It is great alternative for my computer version. Just as much effort I think has gone into this as the computer and Xbox 360 versions
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|They did a great job covering the book.  I like this version better than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy movies-it stays truer to the characters.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Our 4 month old granddaughter absolutely LOVES this jumperoo! A lot of options for amusement and she has loved being in it for over an hour each time....then eats and naps...and if I ask her if she wants to &#34;do Happy Feet&#34;---she flashes a huge grin and wants to get back in there to dance to the music!<br />She will outgrow this in a small amount of time---but it is worth every penny for the joy it brings!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I can not believe that the book left us hanging. I agree with the other review, was $30. for the trilogy not enough money??? I'm so disappointed that the author did not finish the series but just left us hanging.  I felt that she rushed this book.  It pissed me off that Eva couldn't no wouldn't say no to Bret.  This was by far my favorite series until this book.  Now I will never know what ends up happening because by the time the author writes what is suppose to be the final book I will have long since lost interest.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I have always loved this movie since I was younger. Lots of dancing and romance. A great movie to watch over and over again.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I had heard so many great things about this album and this woman. Now I know why, since getting it for Mother's Day. Her sound is unique and very heartfelt. You really feel the emotion in her music. Even my kids fell in love with this album and have their favorite songs! It's nice to not have to skip over songs for objectionable lyrics, too! I highly recommend it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have read many mixed reviews of the final books. I too have mixed feelings. I loved the series and st the same time was slightly disinterested at points. The final book is a fun read and I am glad the rides over. I personally enjoyed the fact it was all battles.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because u get to run and jump on trains trains and on each holiday like Christmas the guard would be Santa or on Easter the guard would be a bunny so u would be chased by a bunny so that is y i like it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I REALLY JUST WANT U GUYS TO GET THE UPDATE 0.7.0!!! I know there are lots of bugs but I really don't care. I just need my fire, eggs, buckets and caaaaaakkkkeeee!!!!!
B000I543T6|4.0|One of the best gangster films of all time. A must see film for anybody who is a Pacino fan.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great series of books, a required read for any fan of the show on HBO.  Can't wait for book 6.
B00030DEQE|5.0|The card arrived two says before the tracking estimated it would. Card works great. I'm used to using Linux and having things just work. Had to down load the latest driver from Intel before the card would work. Great card and fast connection speed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So much better than the movie can't wait to share it with my nieces. Can't wait until the next movie is released
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I was surprised to find the best song on the album was not one from one of the teaser videos that came out before release (smooth sailing).  None of the songs compare to the brilliance of no one knows, but this album is consistently good from track 1 to track 10; this sets this album apart from other QOTSA albums which had many b-side quality tracks.
0439023513|2.0|So, I loved the first book; couldn't get enough of it. The second was good, but nowhere near as good as the first. And this one was just terrible. I felt like I was reading a completely different story. It had poor character development and made you not really like the characters you loved before. Why did she do that. The only possible redeeming quality is the last chapter. I was looking so forward to a great closer and was very disappointed.
1439153663|4.0|okay once you got in to it.  Character development was good, but slow to develop. This was a book club choice.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I know many people complained about the plot, but I thought it was a great book, giving me the info I wanted on the characters, developing the storyline farther.  Will he finish in 7 books?  Most likely not. But I will enjoy reading them anyways.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I pre-ordered this album a month ago and it took an additional day to get to my house.  So, I looked for reviews everywhere and for the most part, they hated it.  So, I started to feel dissapointed already without even listening to it.  Also, I listed to the song previews at amazon with my laptop speakers and all I could hear was Dave M voice (which honestly is not the best asset of Megadeth).  So, I got dissapointed a little bit more...<br />Finally when the CD arrived, I was not as excited as usual.  Well, for my surprise the album is not what the so-called \\"expert\\" reviews claim to be.  Yes... Super Collider song it still there, and I hated it. But, Kingmakers sounds great and probably is one of my favorites of this release. There are other songs like Burn!, Built for War and Dance in the Rain that people will like.<br />It seems that some people wanted to labeled it as another Risk album...well, it is not and it does not even sound like Risk.  Honestly it sound more like some of the songs from CtE,Youthanasia, 13, and Endgame. Mustaine have written music like this in the past.  Check out: I though I knew it All, This Was my Life, How the Story Ends and Black Swan.  I would have liked a more aggressive speed metal album with more solos from Chris and less vocals from Dave (like Killing is my business and Peace Sells)but it is what it is... and it is a good album.  Perhaps we are all waiting for the next RIP but that is not coming.  I gave it 3 stars because there are annoyingly/painful songs like Super Collider in the album.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Fun to watch, intriguing characters. Not family friendly for young children because of adult story lines. Overall, tastefully done though.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It's nice, it looks good, it works good, but... I only got it because it was free. It's not really worth buying because it doesn't tell you anything your device doesn't.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|I didn't understand the purpose of this game, the instructions were useless, not fun, not worth the storage space on my phone.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Book was a good read.  Good character development and twisting story with many turns.  DId not anticipate the good ending.
B003QJME5G|4.0|I was able to control some standard 3 wire/3 pin fans as well as a CPU fan with a PWM 4 pin connector -- my 4 pin connector on that fan also was made to plug into a 3 pin connector so plugged right in.<br /><br />I ran Cooler Master 120S12, Cooler Master 80ST2, and an unmarked OEM CPU fan with 4 pin connector.<br /><br />Thought the color change feature was a little silly, but then switched from white to blue and that looks better with my particular computer's panel.<br /><br />It would be nice if the sides were longer and had a few differnt possible screw hole positions. In my case, this ends up recessed half an inch behind the front bezel...it would be nice to pull it out half an inch but to do that I'll have to drill my own holes in the sides risking poking a component with a drill bit.<br /><br />Word to the wise...take a look at your front plastic bezel carefully to understand your mounting options. My PC has a bizzare plastic front panel when it looks like to really mount this correctly, I would have to cut some of that panel away.<br /><br />The instructions are pretty bad...there is basic info on how to set jumpers for color of led's but the board is poorly marked and the orientaion of the pins in the diagrams is unclear so even that was not obvious. There was no information on installing the temp sensors including no suggestions on where to mount them, how to mount them, etc. This unit does not show voltages as an option. Temp in F or Temp in C, and of course the RPM.<br /><br />That said...overall this is pretty cool and does what it is supposed to. I think they should make this style available in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 fan versions.
B005I6EVUG|3.0|I kept looking for this case in-store for a few weeks because i didn't want to have to pay to have it shipped. I finally broke down and ordered it online and when i opened the supposedly brand new package, I was disappointed. There was a gash on the back, about one centimeter by 3 centimeters, where the leather/pleather/whatever it is was gone. So, here I paid nearly $30 for something...with a chunk missing out of it.<br /><br />You guys are lucky I'm impatient and don't want to deal with the hassle of returns and refunds with shipping products.
B00AG297GK|4.0|All the racism and stereotypes is actually funny. It's understood (by the history of other Cohen movies and shows) that it will be full of that kind of thing. Like knowing what to expect when you go see a Mel Brooks flick;  It's the nature of Cohen/Brooks... If you haven't figured that out yet, you should get used to it real quick or don't watch his movies.  It's all part of the satire.<br />I'd really have given it 3.5 stars, but without that ability, I chose to round up.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game. I love it and enjoy playing it. It makes me feel like I have a real horse of my own.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I like how the author includes real world myths and legends. Easy to follow story line and wonderful colorful characters. i look forward to reading the next.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|...in that there is a pretty good plot as well as good character development.  I bought this book to read as one of my 'guilty pleasures', but was shocked (delightfully so) at the fact that I truly enjoyed this book...for the author's writing style.<br /><br />Like I said, the characters were very well-developed and the story-line was much more involved than I thought it would be.  I think the author did a great job delving into each of the main character's psyche, and in doing so, truly personified them.<br /><br />I recommend this book to any readers that are closet romance novel lovers :)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love Evernote, it is exactly what I need!!  I have an Android phone, an iPad, a Mac laptop &amp; a Kindle E-Redeader. Evernote helps my keep track of all of my MANY lists on all of my devices &amp; and helps me stay super organized. This is something I cannot live without!!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is one of my favorites and the Clifton Chronicles are great!  Can hardly wait between the books for the next saga to start.
034580404X|5.0|my daughter bought this collection. its a great value for the bundle and these books are the book to read love that she got the whole collection for such a great price
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great program - by the time you get to Season 3 you are absolutely hooked! I'm trying to figure out how to survive until I can stream Season 4.
0307455874|5.0|After reading this book written by the sexiest President alive(LOL), and one with coolness, intelligence, wits and swagger, I had no idea what he had endured a great deal of negativity during his time trying to acquire a seat in the Senate, during his time in the Senate and throughout his journey in life. Such a great book, not to mention an amazing and will blow-your-mind read. It is a must-have; if you really wanna know about the man before his two-term presidency and while encountering hardships all while climbing his way to where he's at now and presently; as POTUS. LOVE YAH PREZ OBAMA!!!
B001ANSSDC|1.0|so bad, I try not to recall any specifics.  what a terrible waste of words and an ugly way to state the obvious.  thankfully I had the Kindle version and didn't have to look at that terrible cover over the course of the three days it took to get through this tripe.
B00263HWM8|2.0|What a juvenile movie that producer tried to cover up with extravagant visual effects.  Tom Cruise is so overrated as an actor.
0515153656|4.0|Just recently found one of JACK REACHER SERIES books by Lee Child. Glad I did. One boring afternoon, I happened to find his DIE TRYING adventure within a box of books given to me by a friend. GREAT DISCOVERY. Great book. Now, I, am finding myself involved with the character and his many adventures, written by Lee Child. Prior to my find, I tend to read JAMES PATTERSON, his WOMEN'S MURDER CLUB, and ALEX CROSS series. Other authors include, Tami Hoag, and Lisa Gardner. If you haven't read any of the JACK REACHER series yet, I think you will enjoy them, so far, I have.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Very creative show. I wish there were more episodes than what they have. Just as good as Dexter with the same amount of twists. The one bad thing though is sometimes its hard to understand the British accent. I still highly recommend this tv series.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|This is nicely done and enjoyable but not as riveting as Downton Abbey. A good window into the time period.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|We emergency streamed this on vacation for our two year old. Left the kindle at home so we used the amazon app on iPad. Worked perfectly!
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|I love all the Strokes albums. This one was a bit off-beat for them but there are some really awesome tracks on here. This may have some of the best guitars of all of their albums.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The 3rd book was awesome I don't do spoilers but I can't believe it left me hanging I didn't realize there would be a 4th book! I want it now
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a great keyboard! I have owned 3 or 4 new phones since I first purchased this app and it gets downloaded on every one. Simply the best and worth every penny.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|This is a rollicking yarn that carries you along with it.  I found some of the plot elements a bit contrived, but overall it was good fun to read. I was prepared to suspend disbelieve to see how it worked out.
B00992CF6W|2.0|My brother and sister have minecraft and I do to but my kindle fire hasn't got the update yet!!!!They have an iphone and an ipod touch and they both have the update. I AM VERY ANGRY!!! WHY!!!!!
B008BGNMZU|5.0|this is my second Fourplay purchase and I love it as much as my first.  They do an awesome job with their jazz entertainment.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|I usually don't buy a cd without hearing it first because, let's face it, some of them plain suck. However, with the strokes they are always good (at least so far). I bought this without hearing any of it first and wasn't let down one bit. Great album as usual.
160459201X|3.0|Life is a placebo effect for the most part.  What ever you believe will be, will be.  This book shows you how to use your mind as the engine of belief and exposes how your beliefs transpire.  It was informative and similar to other LOA books.
0060899190|5.0|The book arrived just as I expected it to. On time and in beautiful condition. The content was amazing as well. So many secrets told in incredible fashion. Absolutely loved it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I think this game is really fun and awesome because 1 you get to draw your own stick person and 2 you get to do super fun adventures on it! It's so cool!
193700788X|2.0|After reading all the other books in the series this really let me down. The ending could have gone some many other ways. There is still many questions to be answered.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|When this cd came out I had heard some bad reviews so I hesitated purchasing it.  I should have gotten it sooner because from start to finish I think it is one of their best efforts.  My only complaint is the profanity, however it does seem to fit with the theme of the individual songs.  Keep up the great work.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I chose a four because when the book became technical, the inconsistencies there made it feel like bad tv. Other than that, I absolutely enjoyed this book. Like watching my own action movie.
1442337966|5.0|Awesome, Powerful , full of information I can and do use everyday! Buy it,  you won't be sorry.!  . I got the CD. and still listen to it often.. It has changed me for the better.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|the look back in this book in to history is enlightening.  The character stories and how they intertwine makes it very entertaining.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you like city builders and a game where you can build an army and fight, this is the game for you! Any free time I get, I'm paying this game! Pretty decent graphics and runs smoothly on my kindle HD. I would definitely recommend this game.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|She entangled us even more in this series. It will leave you wanting more as we unravel the forces keeping Eva and Gideon apart.<br />A great read can't wait for the next in this series.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|i was looking for a good strat. game and i had enjoyed other such games from gameloft. so i gave this game a shot and i am pleased to say that its very fun. I also enjoyed the comic book feel that the game has.
B00C061I3K|1.0|The traditional complexity of daft punk is few and far in between.<br /><br />Sad story of another ground breaking artist going main stream....<br /><br />Dull and just like everything else out there bland no originality.<br /><br />Tron sound track was way better than this.<br /><br />I highly doubt original fans will like this.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The quality is phenominal.  I see things that I've never seen in the original taping.  The cast, crew and producers back stories are facinating.
0741470314|5.0|What I Liked about this book is it talked about the truth about Michael + not all the garbage the Media wants u to believe, if u want to find out about the truth about Michael read this book. A great source on everything that happened in Michaels's life! She also includes all her sources from where she got her information. If u want the truth behind all the child Molestation allegations this is the book for u, she also talks about what a good father he was + how he helped children all over the world!!
B004MYFV0O|5.0|The book I have been waiting for to find. It has got clear and precise instructions and step by step projects. For a person who never had art classes (not even in school) this book is an invaluable teacher. I am hoping the author has another book like this, taking it to the next level.
0425263924|5.0|I can't wait for the next one. There are too many story lines that were started. I need closure!!!! Please tell me I won't have to wait too long.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It comes in so handy when I am not at work and have access to a computer.  I enjoy keeping touch with friends I went to school with.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I have owned my Vita since release and never regretted purchasing it. While many games haven't really caught my interest this is one I have always had my eye on.<br /><br />Persona 4 Golden is a must-have game for any Vita owner. Especially fans of the Persona games and those who just love RPG's/JRPG's in general. I was hesitant to pick up Persona 4 because I wasn't sure I'd even like it even with the rave reviews it was receiving. Take note, I haven't really played any of the Persona games,... so this is coming from someone with no experience with the mechanics of Persona games whatsoever. After dealing with a lot of stress in one week, and Persona 4 Golden being on sale... I took the plunge and figured if I don't like it, I can always give it to a friend who will enjoy it if I don't.<br /><br />All those great reviews? None of them are wrong. As soon as I started diving into P4G, I couldn't believe how quickly the time passed and just how much I was enjoying it. I'm a WoW player; I mainly enjoy WoW for raiding with my team and find it hard to spare time for any console/pc/portable gaming other than WoW as of late. I am one of those people that find it hard to jump into a game and stick with it. My point is, this game grabs you, pulls you in, and doesn't let go. I'm finding extra time throughout my day just so I can spend time on it.<br /><br />Graphics: I don't know what PA4 was like on the Playstation 2, but I can say that it almost looks like a PS3 port for the Vita and not PA2. Seriously, it looks good. The parts where the anime comes in is colorful and vivid; the normal running around town and other daily things you do are well detailed for such a small screen and again, an older port. You can't go wrong here. I have no complaints. The characters are all very unique-looking as well.<br /><br />Sound/Music: You'd think with the music that goes on constantly, it would be annoying. Oh my gosh, heck no. I thought I was going to want to turn the music off after several days of playing, but not at all. More often than not throughout my day I catch myself humming some of the music. There are so many voice-overs in P4G I never find myself getting bored of reading through text. Many a times I find myself laughing because of the general humor and all in all, you can't go wrong. The voice actors did a wonderful job.<br /><br />Gameplay: Being new to Persona gaming, well let me just start by saying... Wow. This was a learning curve for me as far as Fusing and everything. I can say that I would of loved a better guide within the game, but the developers made sure that you can talk to the NPC's and most of what you may have questions about, will be answered. Now I did have to look up online guides for help, this is an intricate game when it comes to Fusing and choosing cards. With time you'll pick it up.<br /><br />There is no doubt this is a game you'll be re-playing over and over, so it's replay value is huge. There is so much to do and see, there is no way you're going to catch everything through the first play-through. 60+ hours? Heck yeah, there is no denying you won't be bored with how much you're going to be focusing on.<br /><br />For battles, I found it easier to control my team manually. I'm an RPG fan of many years and I can't see not controlling my characters with how I want things to be done. You have options of switching it around though so I'm sure there will be players who enjoy that. Nothing gets repetitive here, sure you're going to run into baddies and whatnot, but what RPG doesn't have baddies? You also have different difficulty settings that you can choose from when you first start your game, so in other words it's perfect for those who want to take it easy or who want a real challenge.<br /><br />I haven't finished P4G yet, but when I do I will definitely be adding more to my review. It is a must have for any RPG fan, I can't express that enough. For those of you new to the Persona games, don't be discouraged. This is a gem of a game and what makes it so intricate is what makes it so awesome.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|4 star out of 5<br /><br />It is a good book to look up words. It is also very very very interesting. You can have fun always by looking up words you have never heard about before. And it was very fun to look at the abbreviation of some  of the words. It's fun to look up weird sounding words and look them up and find out the definition. Good jobs to all the people who wrote this book. I love you..<br />Or type in a random word and guess what It means. Like this one time I accidentally typed in sex and I guessed the meaning<br />Even though I'm 13 and I am a girl. You may hook me up with someone. I did no the meaning . And if you do hook me up with someone. Tell them I  am a hazel eyed blonde that has a A average in every subject in school. I would love to meet them. Remember I am a 13 year-old girl. Oh and if you do have somebody for me to meet, tell them to email me at pfaffjayla@yahoo.com. Thanks for reading. And I am serious. This dictionary is awesome. Bye<br /><br />Love yours truly,<br /><br />  Jayla Sierra Pfaff

B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is the whole package. It has all the elements for an intriguing novel. Go go EL James. So entertaining. I'm looking forward to the movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, it keeps me on my toes and I am still learning how to do things.  I wishh there might be better direction on how everything works.  I have to ask my son or grandson on some of the things I need to do, in order to kepp playing.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|At first I was sceptical because of the reviews but it is awesome but towards the end it got boring
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is perfect for passing time an a good source of fun I love this game amazing amazing amazing awsome
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|First of all I want to say that Katniss is one of the strongest women characters I have seen on film in a long time. It's too bad that she had to star in such a degrading, sickening novel and film. I am disappointed in this film and I pray that we will learn to love.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved the fact that Dr. Alexander could give credible scientific evidence behind all of this info. Have read other NDE books and am very fascinated by the experiences. Makes death not so frightening.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love the book so much I am now reading it for the second time. Just can't put it down. Awesome
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|We can watch this movie over and over. My 2 yr old daughter and 8 yr old son both love it! Great for parents too! Right up there with Brave.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It helps a lot, I love it! It helps me a lot when I need, well you know a calculator!

B000LC4CVA|5.0|I love this edition of &#34;Celtic Woman&#34;, it is very interesting show and worth to have it.<br />I would recommend for purchasing.<br />J.Witek.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is super fun. Minimal problem solving skills needed. Not complicated, the graphics are really cute. I actually got this app for free! Totally would have paid for this though.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Shows you who the REAL crimials are in this country.....<br />I advise EVERYBODY to get this movie and educate yourselves
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I played temple run for a while but never found it extremely fun, I competed with my friends but that's the only real reason I played. This game however I play nonstop, most my friends either don't have it or don't have the time. But what do I care?! It's fun to play by yourself no competition,plus the daily challenge is something to do,and the missions are a lot of fun to complete.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|all I need it for is to tell whether or not I can go a little longer in between charges. For that reason it serves its purpose for me.
B006HUJRK6|5.0|I enjoyed the audio tape  My life in France by Julia Child, which inspired me to get the original recipe book and also this volume 2 in Kindle format.<br /><br />She love both of them
0394721772|5.0|My cooking skills is improving! All books written by Julia Child is opening new horizons in the kitchen.<br />Thank You.<br />J.Witek
1587613379|4.0|My partner and I are pursing a closed triangle. I got this book prior to bringing it up to have more of a better idea on the views of the different polyamorous lifestyles, Great for a reference and to help open up to new perspectives.
B001O1O71C|4.0|I liked the story as I was familiar with the locale. I think it required reading for all children growing up today to remind them what can happen.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|well written, simple to follow in sum very practical. Awesome, a book for all executives looking to make lasting change.
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|Can't stop listening to it. This album will go down in musical history. It's a masterpiece in all it's dimensions. We recently saw him in Boston at the Orpheum Theatre. It was a breathtaking show to say the least.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This bring to my house lots of joys. Not only myself and my wife, children also loved to listening and watching this DVD. Excellent purchase for gift. I would recommend for purchasing .<br />My regards,<br />J.Witek.
B00CY1JUW2|2.0|I was really looking forward to this but, it's not so good. I caught myself saying, &#34;what the hell is this crap?&#34; waayyyyyy too often.
1455121924|5.0|Very interesting and informative narrative regarding the ills of modern wheat. Fortunately, Dr. Davis provides the reader with some very tastey alternatives. A bit too much time spent on technical specifics for me (yawn). Avery timely work though given the state of the modern wheat belly. It was a real eye opener and I'm in the process of becoming wheat free as I write.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|It was okay, I think it could have been better.  The advertising on the movie made it appear &#34;better&#34; than it actually was.  I didn't hate it, just thought it could have been better.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Well written young adult literature that pulls you in and reminds you of innocence and how overwhelming first loves can be.

B00CXS55LG|5.0|I've got to do this, and this album by Deafheaven is the perfect impetus for my argument.  Anyone who says Americans can't or shouldn't be involved in Black Metal because it's some secret club reserved for forest dwelling Scandinavians, or church hating Euros, doesn't know what Black Metal is.  Americans have much more a right to play Black Metal, especially now, than any of the European bands.  We live in one of the most violent countries in the world. We see poverty, despair, and death every single day. Sometimes we can't afford food for ourselves or our families and we are threatened daily by a large part of the world community that hates and detests us.  Hell, we have to worry about our own citizens \\"losing it\\" and committing mass murder just to break the cycle. The sound of Sunbather is of a band waking up from the American Dream to find that all there is for us is the depressing bottom rung of society.  You were promised everything and you'll get almost none of it.<br />That's the bleakness of Black Metal, the darkness of despair. That is also where Deafheaven bring a different approach.  There can be no true despair without the promise of hope and Deafheaven's true power lies in the layering of melody into their blackened blasts to create something much more satisfying than run of the mill Christ hating.  This makes you recall images of seeing the glitz and glamour of downtown, of well dressed professionals clinking glasses and spending more on one meal than you'll make in a week, knowing that their lives are better, and there is nothing you can do about it.  Its the sound of a crack head stabbing someone for twenty dollars and leaving them bleeding in an alley surrounded by the grandeur and opulence of our broken system, while the life slowly but majestically fades from their eyes.  This is better than European Black Metal has been in about twenty years.  This is better than most American Black Metal as well.  Black Metal is a violent response to an oppressive environment.  There is nothing in the civilized world more oppressive than being an indentured servant, and most of us Americans are just that and only that. Thank you Deafheaven for putting a sound to the misery we feel everyday and to all detractors, go put on make-up and dance around with weapons in the snow. You've never seen real despair.ve environment.  There is nothing in the civilized world more oppressive than being an indentured servant, and most of us Americans are just that and only that.

B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood is amazing. Her voice is incredible and this cd does not disappoint. I've listened to this over and over and have not become tired of it yet.
B00ANVX6DY|3.0|Yet another quickly thrown out movie from Disney, just for profit. My 3 year old likes it okay, but it's definately not her favorite. My biggest complaint is that some of the songs are just plain stupid (A little bit of food?). I can't stand to listen to them because they lack creativity.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was hooked with the first two books written wonderfully by Sylvia Day! This book did not disappoint, of course I was left with wanting more because the plot was just that enticing. I will definitely be looking for the next book to come home. (Hopefully sooner rather than later!) I loved Fifty Shades and finding this series was the perfect thing to read once that trilogy was over. A must read!
B003K15IF8|4.0|&#34;Stoner&#34; is a touching story about a good man with a good brain from an unlikely background of poverty and struggle, who finds happiness in the country of the mind -  and also outside of his cold and stupid marriage in an interval of mutual love. He is almost beaten down by a scheming academic colleague, but brings off one satisfying victory over the bully. A well written novel.
B000FA675C|5.0|I will admit that I had tried to read this book before, but I didn't finish it.  Then I saw the movie a couple of times, and thought I better read the book to know what the main characters are thinking.  The book was very good, but I'm not sure if I like the movie or the book better.  Each was good, but like any book turned into a movie, you are going to have differences.  The biggest character difference that caught my attention was Teabing's character.  I know the book described him as portly, but I kept picturing him like he was in the movie when I was reading.  I really enjoyed reading it otherwise.  I can't wait to read the other Robert Langdon books.
0345803507|5.0|I personally felt the third book was the best of the series. Dives deeper into the character's background and tells more of a story. A good, quick read.
B00AHRWBH6|5.0|Written simply,yet so deep & profound.It speaks to me in every way. Following with practical actions<br />& teachings for life.Along the same path as my meditation teacher,Prem Rawat of 37 years.<br />Easy though very difficult to perfect,as practice makes perfect & this a perfect fit for my Life.
B002HFWBUI|4.0|If you are trying to get into the 80s retro thing, you need to see this movie. The clothes are fabulous. The movie is also quite good at reminding one about how a variety of non-sexual sensory experiences, especially when consciously isolated, can really add a little zing to one's bedroom play. No S&M required!
B00007KWHG|5.0|If you like this music, this is the c.d. for you.  It has all the big hits.  We loved it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Excellent acting. Unique storylines. I really like the way the show portrays the family dynamic. Although it is highly unlikely that a firm would win so many of their cases, I find myself rooting for Alicia every time.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Another great cd by kelly clarkson! I truly enjoyed every song on this cd. I listen to this almost every time I'm in the car. Great price and great product.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'm excited about the movie coming out so I thought I'd read the book first.  Glad I did! Just hope the movie doesn't disappoint.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Strength, cardio, abs... An intense 20 min workout. 3 exercises in 1 DVD. Each great to mix up and the last level 3 is a real workout!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is very good. Usually I wouldn't buy this but I got it as the free app of the day. Really helpful and accurate.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can book 4 come out already?!?!?!?  Can't wait to see what happens next with Geidon and Eva.  Awesome read Sylvia.
B000002QWD|5.0|This cd reminds me of my childhood christmas's spent in my grandparents basement. Bing crosby's voice is amazing, and this is the perfect holiday cd.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I am totally in love with Gideon & Eva's love story. I enjoyed reading the story for that only. I was disappointed with the lack of plot.  In the first 2 books no answers every came as easy as they did in this book. Eva could never just ask a question & the answer was giving. This book did answer all the questions I had from the 2 previous books but lacked the excitement and drama the other books provided. All the hype surrounding this book had me looking for a knock out and it COMPLETELY let me down. I kept reading hoping for a climax to build but it never did. I totally wish I hadn't paid the money because it was definitely a filler book. Sylvia Day could have wrapped up the story and had one final kicker in this book & now I'm 're-thinking buying the next book because I don't want to be let down AGAIN!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I fall asleep with my Kindle by my side.  Even though I have an alarm on my clock radio, this alarm clock is more to<br />my liking.  I love the choice of melodies, plus the weather app included.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|i have collected all 5 movies and i love them all.....just recently went to see number 6 and it is totally awesome can't wait until it comes out on DVD & there will be a #7
B004V2CQTG|5.0|This is a great distillation of the eight principles of leading change in organization.  It is a quick read of only a few hours.
B00371XIJE|5.0|A wonderful, heartwarming true tale about love, friendship and loyalty. Any dog lover will be in tears. I still get choked up thinking about it.<br /><br />A must watch if you love dog or animal movies.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|In the book I didn't really find the words I was looking for. These were the worst books ever in my life.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have trouble sleeping, even after a busy day.  This app has soo many choices to relax the mind and ease your stress that there is no reason to search for anything else.
B0001CNRS4|5.0|this is a really good movie. it shows character and motivation for young females as well as males to not give up on their hopes and dreams.....
