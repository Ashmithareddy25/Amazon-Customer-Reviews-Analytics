B002Q4U9YU|3.0|OK...MJ is gone and the money machine is on! I only gave this three stars because overall, it IS just ok. The material is top notch classic 6 star MJ, though there are plenty of other collections that deserve 5 stars! The only difference in this collection is the addition of a 'new' song written by 'Paul Anka & MJ\\" without crediting him. There are two versions back to back including and orhestral mix (I like the other mix better, this mix is too repetive and wears on toward the end). It was also written and recorded several years ago and could have easily fit on his late 80's early 90's musical input.<br /><br />  With all the songs in the archives, it would have been worth it to release a CD of 10 songs including This Is It. This is released as the movie is out leaving us the thought that it may be a soundtrack with the new song added, but it's not!You can't even just download that song either as of 11/5/09, you have to purchase the CD!<br /><br />  I have the deluxe version with the pictures from the movie which leads me to believe it would have earned more stars as a live CD soundtrack with those versions of these songs. Make sense? Yes! Make money? Yes?
B0029O08WA|5.0|Pre-ordered this item and it got to me a day after the nationwide release date, and at a much cheaper price compared to everywhere else. Kudos to Amazon!!!  Ofcourse I started listening to it immediately. Initially, I was comparing it to the Twilight Soundtrack, but was quite disappointed.  After a few listens, all the songs started growing on me.  All the tracks are fantastic.  I cannot wait to watch the movie, I'm sure the songs will sound even better after watching the movie.  If you like The Cure genre songs and other Indie rocks, you'll find this phenomenal as well.  Two thumbs way up for this one.  I'm sure Stephenie Meyer has all these songs in her playlist.  She has fine taste in music!

B000KJT8IG|5.0|This will one day be a classic.  At least for me, it has made me laugh.  It has a bit of everything about the Christmas Holidays, in particular, the insanity of shopping.  Family is great and this movie shows that at this time of the year, we need to take the good with the bad (cousin Eddie).  I already had the movie but wanted to upgrade to blu-ray (the price was right) and give the other copy to my son, who happens to have the same warped sense of humor as his old man.  A fun family movie except near the end the big kahuna, the word Ralphie( A Christmas Story) escapes Clark Griswald mouth when he loses it.  Delivery was as promised.  The only negative I found is, with both copies, something was/is not right with the sound - I need to turn up my system to the top to hear.  Only DVD that I need to do that with.  Why???  Dunno.
B002OEBMN4|2.0|Let me start by saying I'm a huge Slayer fan.      I have every album since Show No Mercy and every one of them brought another level to Slayer's depth and appeal.  World Painted Blood is the first to lack that.  It's definitely pure Slayer, they didn't go soft or anything, but there's nothing new here.      Spinning through the tracks you can hear clear reminders of albums past - some of the speed of Hell Awaits, some of the shrill solos from South of Heaven, some of the droning rhythms from Seasons in the Abyss, and (surprisingly) even some of the punk of Undisputed Attitude.      All in all, though, it feels more like a mish-mash of greatest hits than a new Slayer creation.
0446615625|1.0|What's going on here? Let me start off by saying that I am a long time fan of Baldacci...but I couldn't finish this book. That is a first for me with this author.  1) It seemed like it was going no where and taking a long time to do it.   2) The characters were a mish mash of unbelievable people.  3) The underlying preachiness detracted from the story.    The author introduces a lot of characters in this book but makes them too fantastic - at least too fantastic to have all in the same story. Any lawyer reading this book would find the idea of a DOJ lawyer working nights as a bartender laughable - assuming they had time to read fiction at all. Now you couple that character with our conspiracy theorists, one of whom is independantly wealthy with a photographic memory, his own multi-million dollar company, ON TOP OF mental issues? And Baldacci piles them on. The idea of a lawyer working nights as a bartender could be a story in and of itself but when you add more and more farfetched characters it just gets to be too much of a stretch.    And there was this constant underlying feeling of sermonizing or proselytizing from the beginning to where I quit. To be completely honest I never did figure out which way he was leaning (left or right) but it was clear he had an agenda and clear that the agenda was driving the story. I hate it when authors do that - regardless of how their political, social, or environmental leanings match up to my own. I don't mind a little political (or whatever) commentary just don't allow it to detract from the story.    I've found Baldacci to be entertaining and readable in the past. His work varies in quality but usually not by very much. This book marked a disturbing departure from that level of readability.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|These shows don't get old for me; they're just as funny the second and third time as the first.  The special features are also enjoyable, especially the interview with David Saltzberg, the consulting scientist.  I highly recommend getting the DVDs if you enjoy watching the show on TV!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Again, I had the original - but, because the price was right, I upgraded to the blu-ray and gave the older one to my son.  Fantastic colors, amazing technology and a wonderful story line.  I think it will keep the spirit of Christmas alive in children.  This is NOT a political statement folks - but, let's face it, the real meaning of Christmas is being washed away by certain people who have an agenda.  We can stop them if wew choose.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is a movie about the life of an average American family (however, in this case it absolutely does not make any sense: it could be an American family, or a British family, or a Russian family, or some other family). This film is about problems which every member of this family has. The plot of the movie is plain and certainly common. Speaking frankly, the beginning of the movie produces enough dreary feelings. You may think it is the regular tearful story about a stupid husband, a stinker wife, their daughter who suffers of solitude and incomprehension, and also about their neighbors: a slight crazy guy who sells drugs and peers through a his video camera, and about his father, an ex-colonel who so extremely hates homosexuals that you begin to suspect him in his latent homosexuality. Of course, the movie shows exactly that. But it is not made like other soupy stories. It does not want to make you cry. It only tells you about lives of simply miserable people; it tells you what they feel, what they dream about and finally what happens to them.<br />  Do you know why the movie Straw Dogs with Dustin Hoffman is really scary? It is not the violence of the ending when bookworm Hoffman kills everyone. The movie is scary because there is no right or wrong. And all this blood bath happened not because some bad guy decided to commit evil, while some good would stop him. It just happened through a series of coincidences. That is scary because in real life it happens like that. BAD GUY comes rarely. More often MISERABLE comes who in return makes miserable out of you.<br />  Similar to Straw Dogs, there is no right and wrong in American Beauty. And Lester (Kevin Spacy) is not a stupid perverted dolt, but middle class man who has not achieved a lot and who could not establish a proper family where he could find love, understanding and support. And his wife Caroline (Annete Benning) is not a bitch or whore. She is just a woman who is trying to crawl on to the surface but she cannot. Their daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is not an evil bestial who dreams to kill her parents. She is just a little girl who suffers from misunderstanding and who is very lonely.<br />  What is a person life like if shower masturbation in the morning is the best thing that will happen to him during the day? If he wanted to be strong and cheerful, but became weak and miserable. The center of the movie is the moment that, no matter how strange it seems, corresponds American Beauty to Fight Club. That is when Lester is trying to break free from the gray reality that surrounds him. In Fight Club the main hero finds relief in communicating with terminally sick people and then gains pleasure from bloody street brawls. Lester did not go so far. He just left his well paid job and started working in McDonalds, began to exercise and use drugs. The idea is that Lester broke free. He ceased being afraid of his bitching wife. He realized that there is no point in straggling for a job you do not like. Because you can be the happiest fast-food worker or the unhappiest vice-director of some office. And when Lester broke free, he felt good. He even starts to look better.<br />  But, unfortunately such a state is not permanent. It is like remission before the impeding end. And the end arrives. Basically, the movie starts from it. Lester dies. We do not know who killed him. It can be anyone. Daughter Jane who cannot stand him and who is ashamed that her father is trying to hit on her classmate. Wife Caroline who hates her husband and thinks of him as a slug and a loser. Jane's boyfriend (who is jealous that Lester did not hit on him), Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley), whom Jane is asking to kill her father. Ricky's father who is crazy about patriotism and fascism and thinks that Ricky has a sexual relationship with Lester. Everyone has reasons to kill Lester. Even Lester himself. Because all of a sudden he thinks it is too good for him to live. Why not die when you feel best? Whydie when you suffer? But Ricky delivers more ideas to the movie: sex, lies, and video. He records a girl he likes, while other things get on to his line of sight. Ricky is the only one person who sees a beauty in an empty bag dancing in the wind. So, it is not considers that he becomes as the final hero of the movie.<br />  The movie is made perfect in all means. From the point of plot (the writer Alan Ball won an Oscar for the original screenplay), and from the point of the director and actors. But first at all, this movie is great because it is about us. About all us, whoever we are -- Americans, Russians, children, adults, psychos. This movie breaks all stereotypes. The naughtiest girl in the school Angela shows up a virgin, the loving family is a joke; a homophobe hides his true orientation. It looks so usual, like routine. Fates of different people merge in one crazy ball and everyone is looking for his/her beauty.<br />p.s. sorry if I have mistakes(I am Russian))y die when you suffer?

B0007ZEO4G|5.0|This album is amazing, this David's Coverdale's debut in the rock history together the bassist/vocalist Glen Hughes from Trapeze. The songs have the groove of funk together the technical and expertise of musicians like Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore, including the fantastic and multipurpose drummer Ian Paice, playing hard and sounding groovy when necessary. The first song \\"BURN\\" is amazing, no words to describe, followed by \\"MIGHT JUST TAKE YOUR LIFE\\", LAY DOWN STAY DOWN\\" and 'MISTREATED\\" closing the best songs. The extra tracks are very good to listen to, specially the instrumental single \\"CORONARIAS REDIG\\", a kind of \\"Space Funk\\", I don't know how to describe it, very good, it's a mandatory album for Purple fans and 70's rock. Enjoy and Rock it!!
B002S0OBFK|1.0|This film was successful only because it was well distributed and advertising ,is very boring and perhaps frighten some people too fearful, nothing happens throughout the film!!!!! I will  not buy it on Dvd or Blu-Ray and I dont want it as a gift!!

B001A2ADGI|5.0|To have the vinyl version of DISRAELI GEARS in hands is the same thing as go back in time and have the original lauching with you. The CD version is already great but the vinyl has more life than the CD, you listen to all the details of the song, it's a different sensation. If you are a Cream fan and already know this album don't miss the chance to have it in vinyl because you can hear songs as SUNSHINE OF YOUR LOVE, TALES OF BRAVE ULYSSES and STRANGE BREW with a great feeling, just listening personally to feel it! There's no MP3 quality that can be close of it, don't lose your time and grab yours before they disappear for 30 years again!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|As a mom of 4 young children I was excited to hear that this movie was coming back out of the vault.  I wanted to share this movie with my kids.  I enjoy buying and collecting the Disney Movies, so it seemed only natural to add Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  My daughters; ages 2 and 8, and my son; age 6, enjoyed this movie. I liked the fact that it came with the regular DVD of the movie, an addiotional DVD with bonus features, and also a BluRay Disc of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  We enjoyed some of the bonus features as well; my kids liked watching the sneek peak of 'The Princess and the Frog', as well as a music video and a sing a long song of Hiegh Ho. There is also a commentary done by Walt Disney himself (prerecorded years back) and some interesting backstage viewing of Walt Disney's Studio.   All in all, we are enjoying this DVD and would recommend it to others that have waited for the return of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to share with their families.

B00030590I|4.0|I've only just seen this after years of catching snippets on TV.  Others here have detailed the plot much better than I could.  Color, music, drop-dead scenery (encompassing western Chinese deserts to Beijing's Imperial City to the Karst Country of the coast) and fantastic acting take this martial arts film to a completely different level from even Jet Li's other films.      One thing I wanted to mention was this: the Asian film scene has a WONDERFUL star in Tony Leung Chlu-Wai, who plays Broken Sword.  A subtle actor, Tony Leung Chlu-Wai's face is like an open sky--emotions just flit across it like scudding clouds.  He's mesmerizing.  He's by far the best actor here, regardless of all the swordplay.  For some reason, he reminded me a little of Rod Steiger--not because he looks like Steiger, but because he has that same bottled-up talent.      The king, played by Chen Dao Ming, is also marvelous.  His middle-aged face is filled with intelligence and a quiet acting style that's a joy to watch.  When he verbally spars with Nameless, I cought myself wishing we could just watch him!     Li's competent, and all the action's just up his alley, but he's so contained I found him uninteresting.  Fancy saying that about Jet Li!!  No, watching the many versions of \\"what happened to Broken Sword\\" simply made my night.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in other films.

B00007KLJJ|4.0|Love this movie. Searched to buy it.  Found it at Amazon.com and ordered.  Was shipped within couple of days.  The DVD arrived within couple of days after shipped.  Quality was good.  Enjoyed watching it couple of times already.  Glad to add it to my collection.  Best part of all....this DVD was about half the price of a new DVD at the store. At this rate, I can add several more DVD movies to my collection....Hooray for Amazon.com.
B000641D2Y|5.0|It's tough for sequels to surpass the One that started it all. The first one is a classic no doubt but.. how they managed to pull of a second 'home alone' incident was carried flawlessly! With more laughs, traps, and warm heart... I think they nailed it (no pun intended) with this one! I personally enjoyed the bird woman side-story over the shovel man. Additionally, their charming toy store is one that kids only *dream* about and was seriously beautifully done. It reignited the spirit of my precious childhood awe and wonders, which is priceless. :)
1601251831|4.0|My gaming crew tested out the Pathfinder Beta rules when they first came out, and we were all impressed with how user-friendly it all was. Skip ahead about a year and, with the advent of the Pathfinder Bestiary, Paizo has continued their tradition of support for D&D 3.5 enthusiasts while, again, making things just that much easier for the DM to handle.<br /><br />The Bestiary is a beautiful hardcover volume of 320+ pages (with Wayne Reynolds art on the cover, by the by) and contains 350+ monsters, from Aboleth to Zombie and then some. Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />The Good: First and foremost, bang for your buck. The production quality of this book is exceptional, from the sturdy binding to the pages, which are decorated with arcane, gothic whirls and swirls throughout. The paper is of good quality, and everything is in full color - everything. Additionally, every monster is fully illustrated, and 90% of the art is of excellent quality. Paizo obviously spared no expense in printing this book and getting it to fans.<br /><br />Now, for the contents. There are some innovations that old-school players may have to get used to. The Bestiary uses a 3-symbol system (explained at the beginning) to define the monsters: for example, each monster, after its name, has three symbols - one denotes its kind (aberration, undead, etc.), another its native terrain (urban, aquatic, dungeon, etc.), and another its native climate (cold, extraplanar, etc.). Additionally, each creature, in addition to Challenge Rating, has listed its XP awards - no more flipping pages in a DMG to figure out how much XP to give to your players. Additionally, each creature is fully statted on one page, with no space wasted. In some cases, there are 2 related creatures to a page (such as Bear and Dire Bear), but by and large each creature gets its own page (or, if the creature is complicated, like a Vampire, 2+). There are no separate sections for Swarms or Vermin, or to separate regular and dire animals; spiders and spider swarms are listed together, for instance, under Spider, and boars and dire boars under Boar.<br /><br />Something else that's great - Appendices. The Monster Creation system offered in the book is comprehensive and detailed and seems able to take care of any contingency - you can tailor any creature you make to a particular CR without any problems, see how much XP and gp it should generate, and so on. Same with monster advancement and alteration: want to change the listed creature's size, for instance, but aren't sure how that would affect the stats? There's an app (or in this case, a table) for that. There's also a section on universal monster rules so to avoid stat block clutter, and another on traits of creature types, and even another on monster feats.<br /><br />The Bad: Not much, but a couple things worth mentioning. First, when viewed critically, this is essentially the D&D 3.5 Core Monster Manual, just dressed up a bit. Certainly its very nice and, I think, worth the money, but this is probably only going to be useful to you if you are planning on writing up your own Pathfinder Campaign, since most of the monsters in Paizo's pre-written campaigns are already statted out for you in those products. Second, the book could have set itself apart by creating a few new signature monsters (of which there are precious few). Third, I was disappointed that the guide paid short-shrift to using monsters as PCs; while not outright discouraging it (and providing PC guidelines for creatures like Goblins, Tieflings and Drow, for instance), it doesn't really encourage monsters as PCs outside of the basic races in the Pathfinder CRB. For some, this may be a minor nuisance.<br /><br />Overall, I have to say that the Pathfinder Bestiary is money well spent, especially for those of us who refuse to convert to 4th Edition.ms are listed together, for instance, under Spider, and boars and dire boars under Boar.

B002OB9KPE|4.0|I've had this record for about a week and my rating has been climbing with each listen - by next week this will probably be 5 stars for me.  I really enjoyed the first two Transatlantic albums, and this third one is at least as good.  The sound quality is much improved over the first two and the musicianship is equally good.  Pete Trewavas' bass is particularly good.    Didn't think a third album would ever happen, so a nice surprise.  Here's to a fourth!

Takes you back in time (19th century).  What a way to spend a lazy afternoon or quiet evening!  You need to sit, uninterrupted to catch the one-liners. Oh the manners of the people in that era!  Men would not be as interested in this style but ladies are drawn to it....Highly recommend to the ladies.
0061719544|5.0|If the existence of the great Craig Ferguson has somehow eluded you, take this opportunity to find out who he is. A funny, sincere, thoughtful \\"vulgar lounge entertainer\\" who has managed to write the best memoir I've ever read. In the interest of full disclosure, I'll admit I'm completely besotted with Craig since I started watching his Late Late Show in 2007. The most amazing thing is that he would tell these same stories on his show if Standards & Practices would allow it. In other words, he fearlessly details his faults -- the drinking, the drugs, the bad behavior -- and is conversely humble about his talents and triumphs.<br /><br />Read this. Better yet, get the audiobook and listen to him tell his story. You won't want it to end.<br /><br />When you're finished, read his novel [[ASIN:0811853756 Between the Bridge and the River]] and then sit back and wait -- impatiently, like me -- for his next novel, \\"Sphinx of the Mississippi.\\"

B000002KAT|5.0|Van Morisson's \\"Astral Weeks\\" is a phenomenon. Recorded as if on a whim, within a few days with a bunch of musicians possessing (as it turned out) uncanny gifts of improvisation and collective spirit, it treads the line between rock, country and blues, even jazz. Song structures remind you of lyrical poems, rhythms and instruments are many times utilized in the best fashion imaginable. Better still, lyrics have something to say. It may take a while to get accustomed to the Irishman's elastic, sometimes growling singing, but in the end you may well realize that it just belongs with this music. Simply put, pop and rock music would be considerably poorer without this gem. Eclectic and beyond category, this is more than essential. For me right up there with the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" and Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\".
B002NXSRW0|4.0|This is a formula action movie with a lot of fantastic gadgets. It has power suits (the sort of military equipment envisioned by Robert Heinlein in his 1959 book, \\"Starship Troopers,\\" but which never made it into the crappy film adapted from Heinlein's book for economic and practical reasons). G.I. Joe also displays some kind of magnetic energy pulse weapons and lots of fancy airplanes, submarines and earth-drilling vehicles. The main technical device in the film is nanotechnology. Its use in the film is pervasive and this movie provides ample illustrations of how this technology could be dangerous. After seeing this movie you can understand why many scientists are calling for tight international controls of nanotechnology. All this gadgetry, combined with the film's well-staged action scenes and fast pace makes it entertaining. Saddled with the unwieldy name \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,\\" and produced in association with the toy company Hasbro (which also produced the \\"Transformers\\" movies) this movie is fully expected to be another franchise film. A sequel is built into the plot. Based on this first movie, I expect it will spawn another film or two which will produce a combined worldwide box office total of a billion dollars or more.<br /><br />The movie's main character is a G.I. named Duke (played by Channing Tatum of \\"Public Enemies\\"). He and his friend, Ripcord (Marlon Wayans of \\"Norbit\\") are the only two survivors of an attack on their heavily-armed convoy by a team of mercenaries led by Duke's old friend Ana (Sienna Miller of \\"Stardust\\"). The mercenaries have superior technology, including those magnetic pulse weapons, which are used to wipe out most of the convoy. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by a secret special operations unit called G.I. Joe. Despite its name, G.I. Joe is not American, but rather is international, comprised of the best soldiers from the world's armies. Duke and Ripcord talk their way into the organization and after undergoing a ridiculously short training program become elite commandos in the secret military organization headed by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid of \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\"). They are opposed by international arms manufacturer McCullen (Christopher Eccleston, a former \\"Doctor Who\\"). He wants to use nanotechnology bombs to rule the world (yes, just like a Bond villain). He not only uses nanotechnology to build bombs which can destroy whole cities, but uses medical nanorobots to control people and to change their appearance. McCullen is aided by a mysterious mad scientist, of course. G.I. Joe's mission is to stop McCullen from using the nanotech bombs. This is accomplished, but acres of room is left in the conclusion of the movie for a sequel.<br /><br />The story has a lot of coincidences in it. Duke and Ripcord just happen to be the only survivors of an attack. They also just happen to be the only people in the entire G.I. Joe organization who know the person who led that attack. They also just happen to be the only people who happen know that mysterious mad scientist. Another member of the G.I. Joe team, Snake Eyes (played by Ray Park of \\"X-Men,\\" who has no dialogue in this film at all) just happens to be the only person in the organization who knows the true identity of the arch-villain Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee). Granted, this is not nearly as many coincidences as it takes to get the ridiculous plot of Atonement off the ground, but it still had me laughing and rolling my eyes. It helps that G.I. Joe doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as Atonement did. The acting is so-so, and the film uses a lot of overt sex appeal in the form of big-breasted starlets for a movie based on a line of children's toys. The same could be said of the Transformers franchise, particularly the second film in the series. But, as a pure action movie, a popcorn movie if you will, G.I. Joe delivers the goods.training program become elite commandos in the secret military organization headed by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid of \\"Flight of the Phoenix\\").

Duke and Ripcord just happen to be the only survivors of an attack. They also just happen to be the only people in the entire G.I. Joe organization who know the person who led that attack. They also just happen to be the only people who happen know that mysterious mad scientist. Another member of the G.I. Joe team, Snake Eyes (played by Ray Park of \\"X-Men,\\" who has no dialogue in this film at all) just happens to be the only person in the organization who knows the true identity of the arch-villain Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee). Granted, this is not nearly as many coincidences as it takes to get the ridiculous plot of Atonement off the ground, but it still had me laughing and rolling my eyes. It helps that G.I. Joe doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as Atonement did. The acting is so-so, and the film uses a lot of overt sex appeal in the form of big-breasted starlets for a movie based on a line of children's toys. The same could be said of the Transformers franchise, particularly the second film in the series. But, as a pure action movie, a popcorn movie if you will, G.I. Joe delivers the goods.
6301971272|5.0|This is the art of movie making, this is what the cinema was meant for. 100% entertainment! If the highest rating a movie can get is 5 stars, this one deserves 6!! I've seen it about 15 times in different formats including pan&scan vhs, single dvd, laser disc and now this special edition. With the inclusion of newly dubbed 18-minute footage and 5.1 mix, this edition is a must have. Even though there are some negative reviews about new voices of Clint and Eli (sounding very old , even distracting from the movie), I believe it is partly psychological since you know which scenes are newly dubbed. If you are going to watch it first time and don't know which scenes are new, you won't get distracted or maybe will not recognize the difference at all. Some of the sound effects have been altered for the new mix (especially gunshots - a trademark of Leone) which is the only complaint I have. If it was possible to keep them intact in 'For A Few Dollars More' 5.1 mix, it could as well have been done for 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly'. But anyway it was great to watch the movie this way too. I take it as a different taste rather than comparing it with the 161-minute mono cut. I wish they could also save the 'Socorro' sequence and even more scenes. This film could last 5 hours and I still could watch it with excitement, not getting bored a second.  So; keep your single disc releases but also experience the new 179-minute release with 5.1 mix. (Second disc is loaded with extras worth to see)
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I love this album. I purchased three of Theory's albums at once, and this one is by far my favorite.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|Wonderful
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Let me start of by saying that I'm not a Trekkie in the least bit. When I first heard about this movie I was intrigued but I wasn't about to go to the midnight showing or anything. I was a little worried that I would be confused and not know what's going on but they made it in a way that you can understand it, even if you've never seen any previous films. It was a great movie and I am definitely buying it when it comes out. By the way, Chris Pine is really hot in it so that's definitely a bonus.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|The five additional tracks are incredible and worth the $40 alone.  Great sound and performance - good 'ol ragged Stones!  Let's hope the vaults continue to get opened.  I would have liked to see the bonus tracks added to original disc - that's my only small complaint.    The DVD is a fun bonus, but just so you know, the songs are not all complete on it.
B002AT4K9G|5.0|Lots of action, suspense and drama. Diesel and walker work well together, I hope their together if many more films. Just as good as Fast and the Furious!
B002B4AAS0|5.0|E, or Mark Oliver Everett for those unfamiliar with the band, has delivered yet another fine album that manages to set itself apart from his already vast body of work.  I'd go as far to say that, if you've never heard the EELS before, you should start with Hombre Lobo, as it is definitely the most accessible of E's work (Shootenanny gets a nod here in this regard as well).  This is more or less E's first 'concept album' (although Electro-Shock blues comes close), which definitely contributes to the accessibility of it, as thoe familiar with E know that he can churn out some pretty weird stuff.  Plus, after the release of 'Blinking Lights and Other Revelations,' an epic 2-disc set representing the culmination of almost 7 years work, I'd say a shorter, more focused album was the right call to make, wouldn't you?    Hombre Lobo is everything you'd want from an EELS album.  That Look You Give That Guy, carried by E's impeccable delivery, has instantly become one of E's most memorable tunes (a true feat).  Beginner's Luck is a great, catchy rocker.  My Timing Is Off is a classic EELS groove, and Fresh Blood, with its menacing groove and lyrics accurately capturing the mood of a despeate man on the prowl, will immediately grab your attention and stay in your head for a long time.  You will not be disappointed by Hombre Lobo.  Any EELS fan will love it, and it's also a great starting point for beginners.
B0029O08WA|4.0|When I first listened to the New Moon soundtrack I didn't really like it. I was a little obsessed with the Twilight soundtrack and didn't think the New Moon soundtrack was as good. As I listened to it more and more I started to love it. You should know that the songs are pretty Indie. I haven't heard of a few of the artist before but now I love them. The songs are very different but incredibly good. I can't wait to see how they fit into the movie!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Pink can do no wrong.  I saw her show in person and couldn't wait to buy the CD.  It's worth the money!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|WOW... Simply Stunning! As much as I do admittedly love many of today's special effects, there is something even more impressive about the stunning picture and sound quality of the Blu-ray editions of the classic films from decades past that are coming out now. Take this jaw-dropping Blu-ray of North by Northwest... At 37, I've actually never seen this film before, but since starting my Blu-ray collection, I have been re-acquainitng myself with classic films from the 70s, 60s, 50s, and before... what an engaging and amazing film Mr. Hitchcock made indeed! Blu-ray seems to make every movie that much better in my humble opinion, and the Blu-ray version of this 50 year-old masterpiece had me hooked form the first frames! The detail, depth and color purity and quality are simply stunning for a film of any age, to say nothing of one 50 years old. This film looks better than several more recent Blu-ray releases I've seen. And the 5.1 sound mix from the orginal mono audio is one of the best I've heard for a mono-to-stereo mix. Listening carefully to the mix with headphones, I heard alot of pleasant spatiality that's not often present in some 5.1 remixes from films of this vintage.... Superlative film. Superlative Blu-ray!
0743579275|5.0|The book reads to the intellectually evolved. An ordinary mind will not comprehend the details. Use the book as the second stage of reading after, Mafaism Volume-1 by Divine Mafa, The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins and The End of Religion by Sam Harris.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|I love, love, love this c.d! The songs are so catchy. I wasn't a fan of hers until Fearless came out. If you only think you like a couple of her songs buy this c.d and I'm sure that you will love every song.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This is the first book by Lehane I've read and I have been missing out.  This book's suspense and slow reveal is impossible to put down. Just when you think you got it figured out you realize you been tricked all along! As soon as I reached the mind-bending conclusion all I could think about was flipping back to the first page and taking the trip to Shutter Island all over again.
0316044695|5.0|My Heart just goes out to our military men and women. We who have never experienced it have NO idea what these brave souls do to keep us safe.  This book is very well written, especially for a person that doesn't do this for a living and has experienced this degree of physical and emotional trauma.  Highly recommend for those far away from the actual war to help them understand what our troops are up against in this war on terror.
0786939532|5.0|I'm not really a huge fan of Salvatore, but this book and the following two really stand apart from the rest of the Drizz't series. Character development, vivid descriptions, a well thought-out society...yes, quite different from his other books indeed.  If you aren't familiar with high fantasy it may be hard to follow - but if you are, you'll definitely enjoy this even if you have no idea who or what Drizz't is.
B001TWT0AE|5.0|This is an excellent movie and a classic. Everyone should see it at least once. It is a great asset to my movie collection.
0375413405|5.0|I didn't want to write a review until I actually tried some recipes. So I've tried like 3 recipes so far (some that I've made multiple times) and even though I've messed up a few times, everything came out delicious. That's how I know that it's a good cookbook. I like the way that she explains everything in detail, even with illustrations. I also like how she tells you what to make as a side dish, and what kind of wine to accompany the meal. Some of the recipes are a little labor intensive sometimes, but delicious in the end :)
B001PJRAUS|5.0|There's nothing deep or literary about Lost in Austen. It's a time travel tale that incorporates all the standard glitches, as 21st century Amanda tries to navigate her way around the style and conventions of the 19th century. Because she curls up with Austen every time she feels stressed, Amanda knows what should be happening in this strange new (old) world, but somehow, the characters simply won't behave as planned.<br /><br />If not taken too seriously, this foray into Pride and Prejudice is delightful. It's genuinely entertaining to watch well known and loved  characters adopt wills of their own. Jemima Rooper as Amanda is spot on, as she struggles to speak and conduct herself in accordance with Regency mores. Elliot Cowan makes a fine Mr. Darcy, although at times he seems to be channeling Heathcliff instead, and Tom Mison as Mr. Bingley threatens to upstage Darcy at several points. Supporting cast members are equally true to form. The scenery is stunning, and costumes reflect proper period detail, despite their rather muted colors.<br /><br />Lost in Austen is a sweet, frothy romance that pays tribute to the original while providing a throughly modern twist. A pleasant way to while away a rainy afternoon.
0545123267|3.0|The probably Hollywood pitch for Shiver is \\"Twilight with werewolves\\" and there are some obvious parallels.  Human girl and \\"monster\\" boy.  Romance. Sense of doomed love.  Teens.  But Shiver is a notch or two above Twilight, though Twilight was, in my mind, atrociously written, so that isn't saying a lot.  And Shiver does have some major flaws,but despite the flaws and the sometimes overwrought writing, it also has some good writing and decent characterization.    The general premise is the werewolves change with the cold, though as they get older the change comes sooner and lasts longer until they're permanently wolf.  The book is set in Minnesota, so it's cold a lot and pretty reliably.  The werewolves can postpone the change by staying in heated areas or wearing lots of warm clothing.  If you're wondering why they don't just move south where it's warm all the time, well, that's a good question that somehow doesn't come up until two-thirds of the way into the book and then is tossed into the discard pile with a sentence or two. It's a pretty gaping hole and one that just wasn't plausibly addressed.  There are also a lot of glossed over questions dealing with how heated areas/extra clothing work and to what extent and why some wolves change permanently earlier than others, etc.  The problem with these issues isn't just that they're unanswered questions  but they a) send a message the author either hasn't fully thought through her world or is assuming her readers won't and b) it all starts to  feel a bit arbitrary and manipulative--it's all being crafted to as to create this \\"tragic love story\\". This is especially true of the ending, I felt (no spoilers) where the logic of what happens to whom isn't at all clear (actually, it feels as logic is just tossed aside) and so again the author has manipulated an ending for impact rather than have things flow naturally as the story/created world has set things up.     The main character, Grace, lives with two bemusedly oblivious parents (implausibly oblivious unfortunately) and watches the wolves in her backyard, one in particular. Six years ago she had been dragged off her swing by a pack of werewolves and rescued by Sam (a werewolf).  The book's jumping off place is when Sam, in human form, finally  meets Grace.  The first meetings made me worry a bit we were in Twilight mode with all the focus on Sam's amazing eyes, but the teen starstruck language tones down in intensity not too far in, though it does reappear now and then.  Eventually, of course, Grace learns Sam's secret and also that this may be his last year as a human.  Their relationship progresses with the specter of his permanent transformation hanging ever overhead. Meanwhile, some of the wolves are getting overly violent with the locals (one boy is bitten and becomes a not-so-nice wolf) and Grace's friends become involved, though with varying degrees of ignorance and knowledge of the truth.    The plot is solid and has its tense moments, though I wouldn't call it gripping (though I'm assuming the targeted audience will be more captivated than I over Grace and Sam's love story), and as mentioned, it has some gaping holes.  The characters are a mix.  Grace's parents are simply too hard to swallow--Sam is spending nights, showering while her father is home, etc. and they have no idea she even has a boyfriend let alone that he's sleeping in her room nights on end.  Both parents veer too close to caricature as well--clueless business-focused dad and spacey artist mom.  Grace is a realistic teen, but neither she nor Sam really stands out.  Actually, I thought the sharpest, most interesting character was Isabel, the sister of the boy supposedly killed by wolves, though he was actually bitten and became one.  She is introduced as near-caricature of rich b--ch teen  but comes alive even in her small parts in the end of the book, more alive I'd say than the other characters who I felt slogged a bit  through the thickness of forbidden/doomed romance.    Shiver was a slow read for me; I didn't care much about the characters or the story and the plot holes nagged at me, along with small, niggling things like Grace saying her mom wasn't like all her friends' mothers:  \\"apron-wearing, meal-cooking, vacuuming, Betty Crocker\\" (I'm not sure this describes many moms today and I'm pretty sure \\"Betty Crocker\\" wouldn't be the first comparison by a 17 yr-old) or the scene where Grace crashes into the woods upon hearing a scream, then, not finding anything immediately, calmly goes back to get her sneakers and wanders through paying attention to what a beautiful day it was--the sort of writing that could have used a sharper revisionist eye or better editor.    Shiver isn't bad, but it reads like a not-fully thought out or fully polished work, one that with another year or so might  have turned out much stronger (though missing out on the Twilight money run).

B0018PH3L0|5.0|The widescreen, remastered, 5.1 version is terrific.  Over the years I have owned the VHS, 4:3 DVD, and now the 16:9 DVD with 5.1 surround sound.  This last version is like seeing it for the first time and the special features make you want to see it again.  This is the greatest Western of all time, now presented as it should be, in movie quality.  The book is even better.
B001AQR39O|5.0|Californication is a highly entertaining, often raunchy series that is well-acted & cleverly scripted. I really enjoy the use of music on the soundtrack of this show as it greatly enhances its themes and atmosphere.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought this since my netbook's volume output was horrible... until I got this little wonder.    First impression is that it is very small and is very attractive... the black anodized aluminum is definitely what sold me. A freebie was that it is powered by an internal battery, which can be replinished by a usb charger (included); that makes this amp a huge win for me since I am not a big fan of buying batteries. The clip is also very functional, allowing me to clip it onto the edge of my netbook LCD screen. The small gripe that I have is that the white plastic on the edges takes away from the total quality of the amp.    Reading the other reviews prior to purchase, I've seen some mentioning a \\"hiss\\" at higher levels of amp output, which I am yet to hear. Since hooking this up to multiple sources, I have noticed that highs and lows really come through with oomph, though the mids are a tad drowned out. But overall, the sound quality is pretty impressive. It has a bass boost function as well!    This amp is a sweet bargain. Anyhow, I always feel that pros and cons are the most informative when considering a purchase, so here goes....    Pros:    small  cheap  sound quality  bass boost  rechargeable internal battery via USB cable  gold-plated connectors on stereo cable    Cons:    usb cable is a bit long  angled stereo cable is too short  white plastic

B002HWRYJE|4.0|I watched this in the Theater and it was great!<br /><br />There were a few parts that I didn't really like.<br /><br />*cough* The slaughter of the Starfleet cadets at Vulcan *cough* At least we didn't see it, I don't think I could have kept my eyes dry for it. I was already gaping when when the Enterprise arrived and flew through the wreckage of the fleet. Thank Goodness that Sulu forgot to release the 'parking brake'.<br /><br />If you're a die hard fan than this might not be the movie for you, but if Star Trek is Star Trek to you than I suggest that you give it a shot and decide for yourself.

0375826726|2.0|I am disappointed with Brisingr.  It seems that Paolini needs to hone his writing skills, do pre-writing, and create an outline to follow.  The book drags on and you get the minutia of the land, the gore, etc.  Characters who could have been more fully developed are given short shrift.  Major events and even momenteous actions are breezed over callously.  I'm not sure how much time Paolini and his editors spent on planning and designing the book; but Brisingr turns out to be a long, unweildy, meandering read that ends with the badly placed \\"hope for a better day\\" motif.  After reading Brisingr, I really don't care to see what happens in the fourth book, especially if it rambles and, as we all expect, ends in the \\"Epic Battle\\" between Eragon and Galibrox, with Eragon, the underdog, killing Galibrox and freeing the world.
0142405809|3.0|This book is OK but I can't help thinking that the author was influenced by another book, \\"Amos and Boris\\", which is a much more sophisticated and eloquent book. This book is probably better for younger kids who are not quite ready for a richer writing style.

B002NXSRVG|5.0|I really liked this movie because I knew what to expect and i watched it for what it was a cartoon turned live action  nothing more than that so i was able to turn off all other expectations and it was enjoyable for me.

0312360258|1.0|Recommended Age: WARNING 18+ (due to language, sex, and drug/alcohol content)<br /><br />After one hundred nine pages, I almost stopped reading. I literally debated for an entire 24 hours whether or not to send the book back...<br /><br />I didn't. I decided that not all reviews can glow.  So I read the entire book, and I'll be honest and let you make a decision for yourselves.<br /><br />This story portrays a world in which \\"vampyres\\" have always existed. Zoey Montgomery is being forced to live with a religious fanatic step-father whose aim is to control her mother so completely that Zoey isn't allowed to exist in her Marked form, when she comes home with a blue crescent moon \\"tattoo\\" on her forehead, the sure mark of a fledgling \\"vampyre.\\" He's an Elder for the People of Faith and would rather see her die slowly than to take her to the school that will save her life and prepare her for the Change into an adult \\"vampyre.\\"<br /><br />Zoey flees to her grandmother's house, has a religious experience with the Goddess of Night, Nyx, then wakes up at the House of Night where her teen adventures begin as Zoey Redbird, adopting her grandmother's surname. Zoey faces a buxom blonde bully, shakes an obsessed old flame, starts anew with Erik (the hottest guy at school - which is mentioned several times), and becomes the leader she was meant to be in the group called the Dark Daughters and Sons.<br /><br />With its spiritual roots right out of a handbook for new Wiccans, this book expresses contempt for \\"religion,\\" which seems to encompass any faith that includes the idea of God as a singular. Elements and cardinal directions are encouraged to join in their ritual circle, after each person has had a pentagram drawn on their forehead with oil, and exchanged the proclamation, \\"Blessed be.\\" Rituals are a regular part of their schedules. Freedom to choose your faith and beliefs seems to be lost to all who carry the genetic marker for \\"vampyrism.\\" They must all worship Nyx, without question. And nobody does question, which totally takes me out of the book's reality. In the real world people get to choose.  It's like they've all been fitted with mind control chips: I. Will. Worship. Nyx.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the religious aspect is that it's so exclusive. As soon as you exclude part of your audience, you risk losing an entire sector of potential readers. If it wasn't so blatantly hateful toward what they call the \\"People of Faith,\\" then I might be able to scrounge an ounce of quality from the writing, which is not entirely ridiculous. If this book didn't include the dialogue, the overdone teen themes, and could make me care an iota for any of the characters, then maybe I'd consider letting a friend read this. But unfortunately, I can't.<br /><br />The teen-speak is insulting to the intelligence of today's teenagers and tedious to the adult audience it had potential to harvest some readers from, given the success of another famous vampire franchise with a wide range of age-appropriateness. Marked: A House of Night Novel just doesn't have the sophistication or depth to share air with the big boys.<br /><br />The swearing was gratuitous: f*** was used quite a few times, as well as sh**, dam*, b*tch, sl*t,and God's name was taken in vain several times within the first page as well as being littered throughout, h*ll is Zoey's \\"favorite word.\\" There's more, but I'll leave it at that for now.<br /><br />Drugs and Alcohol. There's talk of kids smoking p*t. The first conversation Zoey has with her first best friend of the book is about Zoey's \\"almost ex-boyfriend\\" getting \\"drunk\\" the night before. (In the end, Zoey's best friend was secretly seeing the drunk-guy and had been with him on the night in question.) Zoey gets rid of her entire life, family and friends with the exception of her too-understanding grandmother, and gets new friends and feels they're her real family.<br /><br />Sex. On Zoey's first night of school, she witnesses a sex act in a hallway. Sex is referred to casually on several occasions. This book also contains scenes of \\"making out,\\" but not in the tender way Edward brushed his lips along Bella's cheek, but in an animalistic bloodlust-induced frenzy.<br /><br />The specific overall worldview of the author is clear, which doesn't always bring an audience in, but that is merely the beginning of this book's many unresolved issues. I guess the most disappointing part for me was the anticipation of receiving this book (which, btw, came highly recommended from a few Shelfari readers whom I must now hunt down), and the subsequent let-down after realizing I had not discovered some great new vampire series, just recycled bits of Harry Potter, Twilight, and Mean Girls all rolled into one.<br /><br />[...]ex act in a hallway.

1590171993|5.0|I have given copies of this book to many friends with the simple recommendation that it must be read. Every one of them has thanked me.<br /><br />Like many of our own lives, Stoner's life evolves down a path never planned nor intended. While at times his limited choices seem to impose a lifetime of resignation and regret, at last his simple honesty tests his resolve and prove his integrity.<br /><br />It is not the quality of the story but the beauty of its telling that makes this book so worth while. Every paragraph is a thing of beauty.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|A great new show with a crazy story, but well played and a great buy for blu-ray. The show keeps you gripped to the seat and leaves u wanting more.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I just bought this album the other day after coming out from seeing the film.  I realize this CD collection took a lot of flack prior to its release for being what some considered little more than a Greatest Hits package. Well, Disc 1 is pretty much that. I won't lie. But as a soundtrack album, it does what it's intended to do, which is to recreate the experience of the movie. It's all in the sequencing. I could say, yes, I have all of these songs, but in order to hear all of them, in the order they were played in the film, I would have to search through a half dozen CD's to find them all. Here, you have them all in one great package, no need to sort through your CD collection to hear them again. Plus, most of the tracks are remastered so they sound better than ever.    The beautiful new ballad that closes out the film, This Is It, is also a big plus.      Disc Two, however, is what really makes the collection truly worth purchasing. The acoustic, stripped down, demo version of She's Out Of My Life is far and away one of the most soulful recordings I've ever heard, from any artist. The Beat It demo is a fascinating glimpse into MJ's artistic process, as we hear him actually laying down the song's first, original layer.    Lastly, if you're going to buy this anyway, it's worth splurging the extra five bucks or so to get the photo booklet. It's filled with beautiful, breathtaking stills from the movie, and if you loved the movie as much as I did, it's an experience you'll want to treasure forever.     This CD is the perfect way to do just that.
B000002LAC|3.0|I really enjoy listening to all of the artists on the Cd.  However, there were only about 2 songs that I liked.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|\\"Under My Skin\\" may not be as good as Avril Lavigne's first album overall, but there are some strong pieces here and it is not too big of a drop from her debut.  In particular the slower pieces are weak by comparison with her first album, and there isn't as much diversity in sound.  This album was released on May 24th, almost exactly two years after her debut, and almost three years prior to her third album.      The album opens with some good tracks.  \\"Take Me Away\\" has got a good edge to it, though the lyrics are a bit vague.  It leads well into \\"Together\\" another solid piece, though it isn't quite as good as \\"Take Me Away\\" in my opinion.  \\"Don't Tell Me\\" is the first single from the album, and it has a good strong message for young teen girls about not letting boys pressure them into going farther than they want to.  \\"He Wasn't\\" is about a failed relationship, which fits right into a good portion of this album.  It has a catchy chorus, but it is probably the weakest of the opening four pieces and yet still fairly good.  \\"How Does It Feel\\" is the first example of the weaker slow songs.  It is fairly forgettable overall.  \\"My Happy Ending\\" is my personal favorite on the album, and a good closer for the first half of the album.    \\"Nobody's Home\\" opens the second half of the album, another good piece.  The video focuses on the idea of being homeless, but one can also take the lyrics as emotional isolation.  \\"Forgotten\\" starts a bit slow and soft, but the sound builds through the first chorus.  It adds a bit of diversity in sound with its different approach, but it isn't anything special.  \\"Who Knows\\" is another decent piece, but nothing especially memorable, and a few too many repeats of the word \\"yeah\\" making it almost sound like a parity of herself in parts.  \\"Fall to Pieces\\" is another weaker song on the album, good for one listen, but not something I would listen to over and over again and lyrically it is fairly weak.  \\"Freak Out\\" is a nice return to some rock.Ultimately it isn't as good as the best tracks on the album, but it benefits from its placement after several weaker pieces.  \\"Slipped Away\\" is another weak slow song, though perhaps the best of those available, which isn't saying a lot.    This album has several good pieces, but overall it doesn't hang together as well as her first album.  It lacks the diversity of the first album, and what little it has tends to be in the weaker efforts on the album.  The first half is significantly better than the second half, and even though this is a step backward for her, it is still a bit above average as far as albums go.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|What can I say, Slayer is the best next to Manson. Seen them guys in concert to many to count. Their new album sounds more like their old stuff, which makes it good. Can't stop listing to it since I brought it. Hopefully they start touring soon. SLAYER RULES!
0385504225|2.0|While it was just barely an OK read I felt disappointed. Once I found out what they were looking for I knew exactly where they were going to end up. Then the book became just a question \\"how are they going to get there?\\" I could not believe that Langdon could not guess it right away. Also, the italic inner thoughts were annoying and the final chapter almost made me put the book down unfinished...
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Can anyone truly be surprised?  From the moment it was announced that Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Van Helsing) would be helming it and all through its production, just about everyone knew that the live-action adaptation of G.I. Joe would more than likely be incredibly bad.  And boy oh boy, whoever would have thought that it could be so bad.  If you thought that the universally-panned Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was bad, you haven't seen anything yet until you view G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.  Soldier buddies Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) get drawn into the world of the elite unit known as G.I. Joe to take on Duke's old flame Baroness (the gorgeous Sienna Miller) and \\"Destro\\" McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) as their criminal organization Cobra seeks world domination.  Along for the ride are familiar Joe and Cobra characters like General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee), Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Breaker (Said Taghmaoui), Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), Dr. Mindbender (Sommers regular Kevin J. O'Connor), Cover Girl (Karolina Kurkova), and an all too-brief (and seriously maligned) Cobra Commander (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is referred to here as \\"The Doctor\\".  While this is an origin story at its heart, there are just too many over-the-top ridiculous moments that you have to see to believe.  Not to mention some poor CGI effect sequences, stale action scenes, lame costumes, and some incredibly poor acting (particularly from Tatum as Duke), and the end result is this train wreck of a film.  Other than the fact that Sienna Miller looks great in tight leather, there aren't any true redeeming values to find with G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.  Even the most die hard fan of Hasbro's toyline will have a hard time getting any sort of enjoyment out of this wreck, and in the end, the best thing for any and all to do, is just pretend it doesn't even exist, which may get harder to do once the inevitable sequels rear their ugly heads.o once the inevitable sequels rear their ugly heads.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|What happens when you take the concept of Apartheid in South Africa, but this time apply it to a stranded group, or should I say stranded colony, of [[ASIN:B0009X768W BrundleFly-looking]] aliens? You get a cool rap song called [[ASIN:B000002Z7F Sun City]]! Oh wait, no no no. You get District 9.<br /><br />Little known Writer/Director Neill Blomkamp takes little known Actor Sharlto Copley, and with the help of very well known Producer Peter Jackson, makes a great sci fi movie. I was expecting that deliberate shaky camera work in District 9 (like [[ASIN:B0018QCXGY Cloverfield]]) because I had heard that the movie is supposed to be mostly excerpts from a supposed documentary in the making. But that is not the case. Indeed the movie does start out as a kind of documentary. But the shaky camera is a welcome absence. The movie then quickly evolves into a well shot, well acted, thoroughly enjoyable action/sci fi film.<br /><br />Copley plays a bureaucrat tasked with relocating the colony of stranded aliens. This \\"colony\\", that's actually more like a slum, is discriminated against and the aliens don't get much better treatment than if they were in a concentration camp. So it is Wikus Van De Merwe (played excellently by Copley) who must politically persuade the aliens to \\"peacefully\\" agree to move to a new camping ground. Yeah...good luck. And suddenly when Wikus finds himself the [[ASIN:B0002KPI1O Watermelon Man]], Wikus' world is turned upside down.<br /><br />Oddly, District 9 got slapped with an R rating by the MPAA. I didn't see much more than PG-13 violence and language in the flick, but my prawn-like skin may be a bit thicker than others.<br /><br />Verdict: Very cool movie.
0312360258|3.0|I really wanted to like this book I read really good vampire books I heard this was about a teenager girl living in some academy for vampires so I though hey maybe it might be as good as vampire academy.(I personally love that series)But from the begining it was okay but the whole way through the book it just got to be really ridiculous from her watching people having oral sex, to her mark being filled in, and having powers for all the elments. It was really childish writing I'm sixteen and half the stuff in this book was so awful I cant believe two people actually wrote it. Throughout the whole book I was thinking maybe it'll get better but it just got worst she got everything she wanted the boy, leader of dark daughters, and aphrodite out. I would reallly not recommend reading this but if you decide to dont spend your money on it go check it from a library
B000068TPN|5.0|I wasn't there, nor do I pretend to know how it really happened, but after reading the book by Galloway and the Colonel, I am glad there was a movie made about our brave soldiers in Vietnam.  I am tired of seeing movie after movie bashing our soldiers in Vietnam.  This movie also gives the prespective of the Vietnamese soldiers and leadership...    Good movie and recommended to anyone
0596522347|5.0|I work for a school district and I do quite a bit of staff development.  Nancy Duarte's book has helped me to rethink how to plan for my presentations; she has helped me to create ideas not slides.  Creating this type of presentation takes time, but the end product is well worth the effort.  I recommend this book to anyone who does presentations.
B00003CX95|5.0|Simply...I give you the best movie of all time... (War, romance, epic, drama, patriotism, etc.)

0061914177|5.0|In Gary Vaynerchuk's new book \\"Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion,\\" Gary explains the workings of the modern internet media--which has gone a long way towards overpowering traditional media platforms like radio and newspapers--and how to best utilize it towards forming your own brand and creating a monetary business out of it. In the first half of this book, Gary briefly touches upon his own biography and immigrant parents who came to Queens from Belarus, ultimately opening a liquor store. The business ultimately expanded, but it is Gary who turned it into the multi-million venture it is today. Vaynerchuk recounts his initial marketing strategies where he sent large amounts of money on renting a billboard or buying a radio announcement. This helped. But what ultimately took Gary's family business to new heights, cost way cheaper, and resulted in bringing a larger amount of customers was the internet. Throughout the book, Gary constantly emphasizes the importance of online social media and creating brand awareness--from blogging, to posting videos and audios. What I found especially helpful about this book was a step-by-step strategy that Gary includes in the end of the book. This strategy is meant to serve as not only an example of maximizing one's internet presence, but finding specific ways of targeting consumers relevant to your specific brand. In Gary's case, he started a video blog about wine that ultimately gained enough popularity to not only bring awareness to his liquor business, but to book Gary various speaking engagements that ultimately resulted in this book deal. I found the book short, practical, and easy to read. The lessons of this book can be made relevant to anyone--starting with a basic internet user and ending with a company employee.
0307387178|5.0|I'm sure most of us have rebelled against various forms of order during our youth (government, teachers, parents), but for some this portends a hurt that lies much deeper. Into the Wild details the captivating story surrounding the life, and death, of Christopher McCandless.    Having reformed my prior rebellious nature, this book churned some of the old hurt that I thought I had laid to rest. Though this book gives incredible detail of Chris' life and his incredible exploits, its a serious commentary on how we always hurt the ones we love. I was so moved, that I attempted to call my parents to apologize for my faults as a son.., at 4am in the morning.    Krakauer does an incredible job carefully exposing the layers of Chris' story. Carefully researched and beautifully written, I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of their predilections about wilderness exploration. Unable to put it down, I finished it in a single day during a marathon 6 hour session. It's a great read.    You won't regret it.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|\\"This Is It\\" is simply mesmerizing. Frankly, I don't see how it could be any better. If you love MJ or even like him a little, get this! Michael is so charming, so captivating, so whimsical. It is still hard to believe that this legend is gone. If you like MJ you will leave loving him. He is such a sweet human being and treats the other performers with great respect. His magic truly translates on to the big screen..so much so that you feel as if you are right there with him at the rehearsal. I for one will never recover from his loss. Indeed...Love does live forever! RIP MJ.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|A really, really good movie. But why is there no Closed Caption on this download? Eastwood rarely speaks above a gruff whisper, and the other actors (intentionally) have unfamiliar accents. I followed a lot of scenes by continually rewinding.
0061730327|5.0|I love books and think this could very well be the most inspiring one I have ever read.  It's a simple story told very simply and beautifully but is the answer to anyone who says that one person can't make a difference.  I bought it for my Kindle and was crying on the NYC subway yesterday as I finished it.  I went to the Barnes & Noble across from Lincoln Center to see the physical book because the graphics on the Kindle aren't great.   I stopped and told the manager how wonderful it was.  He said, 'Oh, I read the review in the NY Times yesterday.  We should put that book in the window' -- and he did!   Last night I was in the Village and talked to the B&N manager there who said the same thing.  I just bought ten copies from Amazon that I am going to give away.  I have told at least a dozen people about this book.  I think Africa is our great black hope, but I didn't realize until I read this book that the phrase 'the dark continent' must have come not from the color of people's skin but from the lack of electricity at night.  William Kamkwambe changed that in his little village and many others will read this book and do the same.   It's just wonderful.    Buy ten copies and give them away, and tell your library to order it.  I am also going to talk to T. Boone Pickens about buying many hundreds of copies to give away as part of his own program to harness the wind.  He has a few bucks to do it.
B0009353IW|5.0|A very unique record. Musically there are many different elements, some songs echo Mexican folk songs, others are a funkier mix of 1950's Mexicali and rock and roll with that signature Cooder sound. Lyrically very poignant as the spirit of the people survives a tragic situation.  Favorites are Muy Fifi, Chinito Chinito, El UFO Cayo.  The CD booklet is valuable to appreciating the album fully, with all the lyrics & translations and some great backstory.   Quite a piece of work Mr. Cooder!
0810983915|1.0|How can this type of 'writing; can be viewed as constructive. The values, or I should say lack of positive values that it puts forth help to reinforce thoughts and behaviors in our children that will encourage them in such destructive, weak behavior. Is this really the way you want you want your child to view life?
B000E1JOSE|5.0|This is a great CD!  So much talent - it's awesom. Order process was smooth and delivery was quick.
6305428042|5.0|This isn't a creepy, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type movie but will it entertain you?  Absolutely.  It's a wholesome, family movie that will hold your interest and you can still go to sleep peacefully at night without fear of nightmares.  It's become part of the Halloween tradition in my household.  I watch it several times during the season.  I like popping it into my DVD player while I cook in the kitchen.
B000RZIGVS|2.0|I purchased the Star Trek: The Next Generation - Complete Series and am disappointed.  There are disks that do not play at all.  Not quite the complete series I guess.
B00005K3OT|4.0|I absolutely love this unique and wonderful story. The acting is great. The story is a modern day fairytale if you like good writing and directing you will like this movie.the story is engaging humorous yet deep.
0375413405|5.0|Mastering the Art of French Cooking is a great cookbook. Julia Child made gourmet French cooking easy for anyone to have success in preparing and cooking dishes that could be otherwise intimidating.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Never too old for this Disney classic.  LOVE the Blu-Ray + standard DVD combo.
B002NOAF9W|5.0|Yeah!  Alright!  First, the orginal album, included here, is generally regarded as one of the best classic rock live albums, if not the best.  It's been out for 40 years.  I've loved it since it came out in December of 1969 (I was 17).  Santana, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Blood, Sweat and Tears, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash also came out with albums that month -- whew!  The five previously unreleased tracks: \\"Prodigal Son\\"; \\"You Gotta Move\\"; \\"Under My Thumb\\"; \\"I'm Free\\"; and \\"Satisfaction\\" make one wonder why they were left off in the first place.  Of course, the slower tempo blues songs, \\"Prodigal Son\\" and \\"You Gotta Move\\", from \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" and \\"Sticky Fingers\\" studio albums, wouldn't promote sales of \\"Let it Bleed\\".  But they're gems.  Jagger's blues singing never sounded more Southern. \\"Under My Thumb\\" lacks the anger of other versions, plods, but it's shrill guitar tone, thumping Bill Wyman bass line and Charlie's drums drive it home.  \\"I'm Free\\" is done uptempo, faster than the studio version off the mid-sixties album.  The song works in a different way.  Instead of a romantic, reflective, philosophical muse, the song becomes a celebration of freedom.  Perhaps the brightest jewel on this is the rousing closer, \\"Satisfaction\\".  Stones fans have heard this one so many times, on so many live albums, that it's kind of a downer.  But not here.  It's the best version yet!  So, in summary, the five unreleased tracks are a must have for any Stones fan.  This is the Stones at their best.  Charlie, Bill, and Keith never seemed to work together again as well.  Perhaps that's due to Mick Taylor's presence.<br /><br />As for the B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner sets?  I saw the '69 Tour, live, so I was looking forward to seeing Tina's dance revue.  Instead, it's a on a CD instead of a DVD.  It was quite an impressive revue of dancing girls.  Jagger has said he learned how to dance and prance onstage from this tour with Tina.  I wanted to see the dancing girls!  Do I enjoy Tina and Ike's band?  Not so much.  But B.B. King's guitar work displays his mastery of the instrument.  The set reminded me of his masterpiece, \\"Live at the Regal\\", and it's a nice souvenir of the concert I saw in San Diego back in '69.<br /><br />Also included in the package: A mini-poster from the original tour poster (I already had full-sized one); a free download of \\"I'm Free\\" from Guitar Hero 5.  I'm not into that, yet.  When they come out with a Stones version of Guitar Hero, I'm on it.  There's a mini-coffee table book with photos and reflections by Ethan Russell.  The photo of the joint by Jagger's Uncle Sam hat, shot as a possible album cover, is a time capsule from this magic time in rock.  Ethan shares some interesting anecdotes and observations.  Also included is Lester Bang's review of the album (he's portrayed in the film \\"Almost Famous\\") -- a compare/contrast essay of the Stone's bootleg \\"Live'r Than You'll Ever Be\\" (I used to own it) and this album.  The bootleg didn't stick around in my record collection; the original album did.<br /><br />The DVD shows the Madison Square Garden crowd, including Jimi Hendrix, as the band enters the house.  Jagger and Richards look young as they unravel \\"Prodigal Son\\" and \\"You Gotta Move\\" in an \\"unplugged\\" break from the rock.  Charlie Watts' photo session with the donkey on the freeway is hilarious.  But the album cover came out perfect.  The DVD shows Keith at the piano.  Mick, tipsy, if not drunk, fumbling with tapes.  Mick performing \\"Under My Thumb\\" is underwhelming. All in all, the DVD is a second-rate documentary.  Keith and Jimi hang out, jam a little.  The rousing \\"Satisfaction\\" is the DVD's best moment.<br /><br />If you're not a Rolling Stones fanatic, you may not want to pay up.  If you are, it's worth every penny.Tina and Ike's band?  Not so much.  But B.B. King's guitar work displays his mastery of the instrument.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|You never know what Dr. Frankenstein may crave as he examines the latest body. It's worth your time to watch this series and find out for yourself what this means!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I saw this film today and was blown away. It was great!  I would absolutely see this again and again. The concert would have been amazing, it is such a shame that it won't happen.  MJ was so very talented.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|I grew up on G.I. Joe.  I had a huge collection of the toys and watch the show every day it was on.  When I found out they were doing a movie I was a little skeptical.  I mean, they did ok with Transformers, but G.I.Joe is a different beast.  When I saw the trailer I thought \\"this is going to be stupid, but I will probably see it anyway\\"  So I finally went to see it in the theater with pretty low expectations.<br /><br />I can say I really enjoyed it, not sure if it was my low expectations or what, but it was really good.  Given the context of what G.I. Joe is, an over the top action adventure with near super human soldiers fighting and even more over the top enemy in Cobra this movie delivered.  Yes, it defies reality an so many ways and is pretty campy in places, but it worked.  I enjoyed action scenes, the back stories and the banter between the characters.  The affects were good and the acting was not too bad, with the exception of Duke.  The \\"yeah right!\\" and \\"O Brother!\\" moments were kept to a minimum, and that is an achievement for this kind of movie.<br /><br />They also gave props to the show, the obligatory \\"Yo, Joe\\" and \\"Knowing is half the battle\\" are obvious.  But small details like Breaker with the bubble gum and the mention of the Laser Artillery Weapon (L.A.W.) were nice touches.<br /><br />I watched it again last night on Blue Ray and it looked and sounded great.  And I still enjoyed it the second time.  I recommend it if you want just a fun far out action flick that does not take its self too seriously, or of course if you are a Joe fan.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|Crazy Love is the first Michal Buble album I have listened to on CD.  I have heard many, many of his songs on the radio, but I have never picked up a CD and listened to every song.  That being said, I am a big fan of his sexy, soulful voice and I enjoy his variations of classic, romantic songs.  I had a party a few weeks ago and the musical preferences of the guests were very diverse, so I decided to play it safe and put on Crazy Love.  Michael Buble's voice is very soothing and allows guests to chat with one another and enjoy his music simultaneously.  I noticed a lot of my guests singing along to the familiar songs on his album.  Although I prefer some of the original versions of the songs, I have really enjoyed Crazy Love and I look forward to listening to some of his earlier albums soon.

This re-release like her Deluxe Edition of her self-titled album features new songs and a DVD.<br /><br />The CD contains 5 new songs and a piano version of Forever & Always (previously released on Fearless) & the original 13 tracks on the Fearless album. The new songs include, \\"Jump Then Fall\\", \\"Untouchable\\", \\"Come in With the Rain\\", \\"Superstar\\", & \\"The Other Side of the Door.\\" \\"Untouchable\\" was performed prior to it's release on the Clear Channel Stripped site by Taylor as a big promotion for the 2008 release of Fearless. \\"Come in With the Rain\\" has been available as a digital download since 2007. I rate the new songs 5/5 because they are all very good and well done. \\"Jump Then Fall\\" is currently my favorite new song.<br /><br />The DVD that comes with Fearless Platinum Edition contains the 5 music videos that have been released prior to it's release, this includes, \\"Change\\", \\"The Best Day\\", \\"Love Story\\", \\"White Horse\\", & \\"You Belong with Me\\", 3 \\"on the set\\" behind the scenes making of the music videos (\\"Love Story\\", \\"White Horse\\" & \\"You Belong with Me\\"), a photo gallery of the 2009 Fearless Tour, A behind the scenes of the first show of the Fearless Tour in Evansville, Indiana. and the parody video of \\"Thug Story\\" with T. Pain that Taylor did for the 2009 CMT Music Awards. There is also 2 different exclusives, one done by Wal-Mart and one done Target. The Wal-Mart exclusive version of Fearless Platinum Edition contains 2 DVD exclusive bonus content of the V-Fest UK: Live performances of \\"Love Story\\" and \\"You Belong with Me\\" and the Target exclusive version also contains 2 DVD exclusive bonus content of the Clear Channel Stripped performances of \\"Untouchable\\" and \\"Fearless\\"<br /><br />All together the album is great and you won't be disappointed. Please note that there is only 5 new songs, not 6 as advertised seeing as the \\"Forever & Always (Piano Version) is just that, a piano mix of it's previously release. So if you are a Taylor Swift fan, you don't wanna be without Fearless Platinum Edition6 as advertised seeing as the \\"Forever & Always (Piano Version) is just that, a piano mix of it's previously release. So if you are a Taylor Swift fan, you don't wanna be without Fearless Platinum Edition

0312370849|5.0|This book touched my heart. it was about world War II and how lives were destroyed and how a  young girl tried to help her brother and for the rest of her life she had to endure her decision...The author did a good job of telling the historical tale you felt as if you were right there.
B001IXSU8M|4.0|I have a lot of respect for Lady Gaga. For those who just don't like the music, that's fine. For those who think she's a symptom of what's wrong with music, you don't get it.    Here is a young woman, clever and smart, self-made, and able to make a joke while simultaneously being the subject of it. On the surface, the music is slight, the sound very processed, and everything is engineered just so. \\"Paparazzi\\" and \\"The Fame\\" are perfect examples (but not the only ones) where she mocks and celebrates excess. Is she a celebrity stalker or stalkee? Probably both. Is she doing it for the fame? You bet!    The rest of the album is so unbelievably hook-y that it seems like a greatest hits collection in the making. I hope she can follow up as strongly. Much like Madonna (undoubtedly a strong influence), Lady Gaga's career is likely to be a fascinating study in evolution.
B001N26GFM|4.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is a movie that left me conflicted, to say the least. It involves a friendship that comes from the most unlikely of places, and ends with a tragedy that involves droves of Jews and one German boy. While I will not say exactly what happens, I will say that feeling bad for this one boy seems to be a bad thing in some ways because I felt sorry for him only because of the way he was presented. His father was the director of a camp that kills Jews, his family a beast filled with blind followers, and one boy looking into the Jewish camps and wondering why he wasn't allowed to play the game the Jews were allowed to play.<br /><br />As far as movies go, the movie was done well and shows something about the youth of a country that killed at leisure. There is the confusion, the wonder, the want to help, and all of the ignorance that youth can breed. It accomplishes everything it sets out to do, too, making you feel sorrow when the curtain comes down. I hope that the movie was also meant to make a person examine this sorrow they felt, knowing that the word genocide is associated with the thing they just watched. The other people in the striped pajamas were not props but were instead reminders of people that were going to die a horrid death, and yet one boy on the wrong side of the fence was the thing that we were watching. His life, his actions, his family's sorrow; these things were the things we saw. What we did not see were the pieces that were missing from the puzzle; the families that could not cry because they were no longer anything save ash mistaken for snow on the breeze.<br /><br />Do I recommend the movie? I'm not sure. I do know that I liked the movie, that it moved me, but I'm not sure it moved me in the way it was supposed to. It has a complexity to it, one that I hope people do not miss, but that several newspaper reviews seemed to lose in their interpretation of the movie. I suppose I'm saying that I recommend the movie but only to those that see the entire picture, and mourn for the entire picture as it is conceived.the entire picture, and mourn for the entire picture as it is conceived.
B001E5FYS8|3.0|It's clear to me that the Oscar was granted due to the subject matter; the nostalgia for the time when the Twin Towers were brand new, and when America was free enough that a man could actually wire walk between them without being picked off by a police or military sniper in mid-performance or being sentenced to life after he walked off the wire.  It's impossible for an American to watch this movie and not be constantly reminded of 9/11; this movie takes back the Towers from Bin Laden to some extent, and for that reason alone I think it won the Oscar for best documentary.  I felt the nostalgia myself, being old enough to remember Petit's feat and the construction of the Towers.<br /><br />It's great to see Petit perform; his enthusiasm is contagious; and as the participants admit, the planning and execution of the walk are like a heist movie where no one is robbed or hurt.  The climax, where we see him walking between the Towers, is worth watching the entire movie to see.  But the remainder of the film is flawed.  Primarily, I wanted to know more about his friends who helped him in his guerilla wire-walking endeavors, particularly the Americans who he recruited in New York.  How did he meet them?  Why did they agree to help?  I understand that artistically the choice may have been made to not tell us; it's Petit's life, and they're just along for the ride, and cut loose after he reached his lifelong dream.  But I think it would have been a better documentary if we knew a little more about how he persuaded his friends and helpers to help with his epic feat.  It's not like the movie didn't have enough time; even at 100 minutes, it felt awfully long.<br /><br />\\"Man on Wire\\" is at least worth a rent; you will like it, even if you don't love it.  But it probably won't be a movie you'll want to add to your permanent collection.
B00001ODGR|5.0|First of all, as my subject line indicates, I'm actually NOT that much of a Styx fan. Prior to purchasing this DVD, I had always been simply a casual radio listener, with respect to their more well-known hits, and didn't own any of their individual albums (actually, I still don't). And you can count me among those who found Dennis DeYoung's vocals and penchant for theatrical bombast rather...annoying. With all of that in mind, it was an odd whim on my part to buy this DVD when I saw it in a store.     I'm glad that I did, because it is an extremely enjoyable concert DVD...I would even go so far as to say it's one of my favorites in my music DVD collection.  Regardless of whatever interpersonal tensions may have existed in the band (from what I've read), here is a band playing their @sses off for their audience, and looking for all the world like they're having a blast doing it.  And they sound REALLY good. Shaw and JY are a terrific one-two punch on guitar (as a guitarist myself, I can particularly appreciate the way they interact and compliment each other), their new drummer (well, new at the time, anyway) is outstanding, and...surprise of surprises...DeYoung actually impressed the heck out of me with his vocals.  His voice is strong, clear, absolutely on-pitch, and seems to have improved with age. Honestly, he was the part of the show I most dreaded seeing/hearing, and he ended up being the biggest pleasant surprise! Yes, some of the cheese factor is still there, as others have mentioned, but it all works in the context of this show and their music.  Besides DeYoung, the vocals for the band were terrific overall; I've always like Shaw's lead vocals, and those are NOT easy high harmonies to hit on many of their songs.  The setlist is a pretty good mix...besides the obvious \\"big\\" radio hits, it was good to hear album cuts and \\"minor\\" hits like \\"Snowblind\\", \\"Lorelei\\", and my personal favorite of the entire show, the opening number, \\"Rocking in Paradise\\", which seemsto distill all the best aspects of the band nicely and neatly in one song (and they look like they're having a hoot playing it).  Sorry to the die-hard fans, but no, I do NOT miss \\"Mr. Roboto\\" in the setlist!  Oh, and lest anyone think I forgot him, the bass-playing Panozzo may look like the most understated performer of the bunch, but I like that balance he provides in their stage show...he just looks like he's playing it cool, enjoying all the silliness going on around him...and his playing is great.     So...that's it for me. A non-Styx fan who thoroughly recommends this DVD to anyone who likes just a good old fun and well-done rock and roll performance. Grab a beer (or soda) and some chips, and enjoy!
B001OBT3FC|5.0|When this disc came in I immediately played the Tchaikovsky 6th and found it very enjoyable. The sound is outstanding but one needs to manually select the 5.1 option each time it's played. The stereo version seems to leave much lacking but the 5.1 version provides an exciting ride.<br /><br />The Beethoven is also well done which all together provides a fairly satisfying evening's listening.<br /><br />I tried listening to the audio only, no picture, just to check my reaction on a comparative basis to some other recordings I have of the 6th. I have to say von Karajan's digital surround recording of the 6th on DTS is probably more exciting but the uncompressed audio on this disc does give it a distinct audio advantage.<br /><br />I would say that anyone who enjoys a colorful performance will enjoy this one; I'm glad I've added it to my collection.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|The makers of Ice Age have done it once again! Ice Age 3 seems like the perfect capstone for the Ice Age trilogy. It might not be quite as hilarious as the first two movies, but it is pretty funny. Sid is as clueless as ever. Manny becomes a stressed out parent. Buck is a decent addition (best line:  \\"He who has gas, travels at the back of the pack.\\").<br /><br />More importantly, Ice Age 3 is a good all-round movie. The blu-ray version has great graphics and amazingly rich sound - easily the best of them. The movie has some exciting action scenes, including a ride on the back of a pteranodon reminiscent of Star Wars.<br /><br />Granted the idea of a lost world filled with dinosaurs below the Ice Age snows doesn't make a whole lot of natural history sense. Then again, we're talking about mammoths who make fart jokes. That being said, the dinosaurs are well done (better in my opinion that Land of the Lost).<br /><br />If you liked the first two Ice Age movies, don't miss out on this one!
B000DZIGDU|5.0|I am not a huge fan of war movies in general.  I find them all too often rather boring and redundant.  I know that they have a huge fanbase but I just never found myself in that select group.  I have enjoyed a few to an extent, but in general, if it's going to be a war movie, I much prefer the kind that involves bows and arrows and spears and armor, not guns and tanks.  I think that it is my predisposition to war films that actually made `Jarhead' stand out to me as so well done.  It is far from your typical war movie, mostly because the war is not a major character in the film.  It is more a haunting enigma that hangs over the heads of every character in the film, a hushed secret that keeps eluding them the more they desperately reach out for it.<br /><br />Anthony Swoffard is reaching pretty high.<br /><br />`Jarhead' is based off of the memoir written by Swoffard.  I have not read the book, although I hear that it is fantastic.  It chronicles (as does the movie) the action, or lack there of, that takes place while these young men train to kill.  What I loved so much about this film is that it really captures that desperation, that longing for purpose that these young men go through while separated from all they know and love.<br /><br />Not too long ago I was on a cruise with the wife and we were talking with the other couples at our dinner table (whom we had never met before), one of which was on leave to get married and was going to be returning to active duty overseas.  During our conversation he commented that a lot of the soldiers he knew, young soldiers, were there for the `thrill'.  We collectively (at least the men at the table) agreed that a big draw for young ones to join the army is to get to try in real life what they spend hours doing in videogames.  Even the `Army Now' campaigns on television focus on the action, the fighting, the `thrill'.<br /><br />`Jarhead' exposes the reality behind that `thrill'.<br /><br />Thanks to some very competent performances, `Jarhead' becomes impeccable.  I have raved and then bashed Gyllenhaal in my reviews and in conversations.  He has talent, he just doesn't always capitalize on it.  This same year he did `Proof' and `Brokeback Mountain'.  In my initial review for `Brokeback Mountain' I raved Gyllenhaal, but after subsequent viewings I realized how `out of place' he seemed at times.  In `Proof' (which I have yet to review) he is just forgettable.  In `Jarhead' he is marvelous.  There is a quality to his eyes that portray an almost confused curiosity, as if he wants to know more but is afraid of what he'll learn.  He conveys that so well here.  Jamie Foxx also steps up his game by sinking into what could have been a generic and clich&eacute;d character and giving him a little extra life.  The slew of supporting actors, not the least of which is Lucas Black, really bode well with the film and its purpose and deliver exceedingly well.<br /><br />But, if you have read the four reviews that preceded this one you will know that this review was inspired by one man and one man alone; Peter Sarsgaard.<br /><br />This is my favorite performance by Peter and truthfully one of the best supporting performances of this past decade.  He has such power and control and dynamic character development.  What is so wonderful about this performance is that he truly plays `supporting' very well.  Throughout the first two thirds of the film he almost disappears behind the man that is Gyllenhaal, allowing the film to really root in Swofford's character.  He makes a statement, sure, and he becomes that secondary character you want to learn more about, but he never crosses that line with showy actorly acrobatics.  And then the sniper scene comes and this man crumbles and I was literally BLOWN away (seriously, best single sequence of acting in the year that was 2005).  Everything that he has been gradually building up to just unloads in a single breathtaking scene.  This mans entire existence shatters and leaves us with a devastating climax.<br /><br />Sam Mendes is a director who I really have a lot of respect for.  He has gotten a bad rap for winning the Oscar so soon (first film, `American Beauty') but his following films have proven his talent.  While `Road to Perdition', `Jarhead' and `Revolutionary Road' all have there drawbacks (`Jarhead' doesn't really have one for me, but I understand why others find it less than rewarding, especially if they were expecting a generic `war' movie) they also exude a distinct knowledge of subject by Mendes.  He understands how to create something that titillates the senses (`Perdition's' rain soaked sets, `Jarhead's' sun cloaked bodies, `RR's' rooms bathed in white)  but also delivers a profound blow.  I think that for a young director he has built for himself quite the resume (I still have not seen `Away We Go', but as per usual with Mendes, it has its raving and its scathing reviews).<br /><br />If you are looking for something that is less typical and more thought provoking; less generic and predictable and more emotionally investing then I highly recommend you seek out `Jarhead' immediately.  If you are looking for your average `blow `em up' type war film then stay far, far away.director who I really have a lot of respect for.

B000JMKSE2|5.0|In \\"The long tail,\\" Chris Anderson provides a unique explanation for the strong economic behavior of ecommerce retailers.  The author begins by reviewing mathematical curves that characterize the relationship between two variables: number of times an item has been purchased (on y axis) vs. items available for sale (rank ordered according to \\"popularity of item\\" on the x axis).  In traditional retailers (bricks and mortar), the curve follows a power law (e.g. y = 1/x)...but x is limited by the physical size of the store...          In contrast, the sales curves for modern ecommerce businesses (e.g. amazon, rhapsody, itunes) take on a different shape: x is much larger--nearly infinite--and as the sales curve flattens out to the right, it drops down much more slowly than one sees for brick and mortar businesses (the tail of the curve is flat or \\"long.\\"  This effectively means that there is \\"surprising\\" demand for \\"niche\\" products that you would never see in brick and mortar stores (which cannot afford to stock the same number of goods).  Amazon, itunes, etc. are effectively able to match demand for niche products with supply of niche products using powerful search tools and (in the case of amazon) third party vendors managing inventory.               Interestingly, Matthews points out that Sears was a pioneer in taking advantage of the long tail model of business economics.  Certain businesses (ebay, amazon, itunes) have taken the long tail phenomenon to a new level by using the internet to lower their fixed and marginal costs...and by creating tools that effectively match buyers and sellers for their millions of niche products available for sale.  After reading this book, the most interesting question that comes to mind is whether or not the amazon kindle will create the same economic wonders that itunes provided to apple via the power of the \\"long tail.\\"  The next 5 years will tell us...
B002H3F7F6|2.0|What happened to Sting's voice? He sings the songs on this album in a strangled baritone. Is this really what he sounds like now?  I gave \\"If On A Winter's Night\\" 2 stars for the lovely arrangements and the interesting choice of songs. Based on the vocals alone it would have only earned a single star.
0385504225|5.0|This mega-bestseller has unfortunately and unfairly received mixed reviews. The reactions posted on Amazon reflect the response. About 1500 people, an astounding number, expressed their opinions in an almost evenly divided manner; close to the same number of people gave 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 stars, although 503 handed the higher four or five stars, 686 offered the novel only one or two stars.<br /><br />Why did so many people have problems with this book? Apparently people focused on matters that they should have avoided. Two things come to mind.<br /><br />First, people tend to look for faults rather than enjoy what is in front of them; they do so with life generally. This is more unsound than seeing a bottle half filled. Pessimistic people with a half bottle of superb wine, who see it as being half empty rather than half filled, are still able to enjoy the wine. But people who look for faults end up tossing good wine - an excellent suspenseful novel in this case - into the trash can.<br /><br />Sure, if one searches carefully one can find faults. Yes, Dan Brown offers explanations of phenomenon which he says are the true reasons when scholars have a host of other ideas. For example, scholars recognize that we no longer know the meaning of the word amen and they offer many other speculative notions of its origin other than what our author proposes is the correct answer. It is true that the main reason why the ancients hid their opinions was not because they feared the ideas would be used to harm the world; they did so because they wanted to be helpful: they knew that the average person would be unable to understand the truth as they saw it and become confused.<br /><br />Certainly, the meaning of malakh is \\"messenger\\" and the biblical book of Genesis speaks of a nefesh, and not a neshamah, as Brown contends, and neither word means \\"soul\\" when it is used in the Hebrew Bible, but \\"life force.\\" Sure, while most people feel that \\"belief\\" is a religious requirement; most rationalists say that people should not give way to passive blind acceptance of irrational ideas, but that religion requires people to use their minds and improve themselves and the world.<br /><br />But, so what! This is a novel, not a dissertation. It was meant to be enjoyed. Why not do so? If Mr. Brown uses the plural Sefirot when he should have used the singular sefirah, so what? Why not smile and move on? Why not focus on the many many more ideas that Dan Brown presents correctly? Why not use this book to provoke further thinking? Why not simply enjoy the story?<br /><br />His ideas about noetic science are fascinating. His remark that the basic teaching of religion is respect of all people is correct. He is also right when he says that it is not enough to know the truth, the truth must be augmented through practice, through acts that help others. In short, those who approach this very fine book intending to find fault are missing a lot and are hurting themselves.<br /><br />The second problem seems to be that some people are turned off because Mr. Brown has a different concept of God and religion than what most people were taught as youngsters. But, perhaps he is correct and the childish notions most people hang onto are improper for adults. However, even if he is wrong, so what?

B002RVZV9K|5.0|I caught this limited release documentary in the theater and cannot wait to see it again and to gift it to every guitar-loving friend I know.<br /><br />\\"It Might Get Loud\\" is ridiculously, thunderously, deliciously good.  If you love music, if you love guitars, if you love the creative process, you'll love watching while the boys pull back the curtain on their first guitars, on falling in love with music and on how it all comes together.<br /><br />Some of the highlights; the Edge at the bulletin board where he first spotted 'Larry's' ad for musicians, the grown-up Jack White talking to little Jack White and getting to see Jimmy's face light up when he starts talking about the music.  It's all just fabulous.<br /><br />And when it was all over, I was just so glad that I play the guitar-- until I remembered, uh... I don't.  But they do.  And their enthusiasm and appreciation is just so infectious, you'll be running home to grab your imaginary Fender.

B001FB55I0|1.0|the trailer for T:salvation was perhaps one of the better trailers I'd seen in  along time. Despite the fact that McG was directing, my expectations were high. But man was the movie disappointing. Sure the special effects were great, which is a credit to the animators and the budget for FX, but everything else was just terrible. The story was WEAK, the acting mediocre, the editing choppy and all the fun of the previous terminator movies was completely missing. It was an overserious bore.
B001DPC4R8|5.0|I've recently picked up a turntable and started collecting vinyl records. I'm an audiophile and music lover and have always been a big fan of Hotel California, one of the great classic albums of our time. It is a collection of very well written songs and delicious sound quality as well....on CD.    It was only natural I should pick it up on Vinyl. Originally I picked up a used copy at a record store but found it too be a bit too worn out and noisy for my taste. Luckily, brand new copies of this album are available here on Amazon which is pretty rare for ANY classic record, and it's 180g to boot!    After a fair amount of back to back listening against the CD I've found the difference to be rather close but still there. The vinyl is a bit more open sounding and fuller as well; dynamically they are about the same.     On a song like \\"Wasted Time\\", \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" is where you will probably notice the difference the most.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is an excellent controller, you can feel the action in your own hands. It's awesome!   The only thing i didn't like about this was that at the description says that \\"The controller can be charge at any time using the Controller's USB CABLE\\" ... guess what, it DOESNT bring the USB CABLE! you have to look for an extra cable somewhere...   I recommend to fully charge this controller the first time it's used to a better battery life in the future.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Well, there is a lot to enjoy about snow white bluray. First of all, the video quality is up-to-par modern releases, which is remarkable considering the technical advantages newer films have had. Second of all, the audio options available can satisfy almost everyone who is not the most recalcitrant audiophile. The sound of the English multichannel track is a good complement for the already excellent video quality. Also you'll find some extras that are likely to satisfy everyone.    In an additional note I'd like to also recommend Spanish speaking customers buy this title. \\"Aunque el nuevo track para este bluray no es el que quiza se recuerde haber oido la primera vez, todavia conserva la \\"magia\\" que se recuerda de las primeras ediciones\\".     It's a must-buy.

B0000WN0ZK|4.0|This movie like alot of art movies has lots of images and ideas thrown at the viewer without really trying to tie up plot lines.  These type of movies are a aquired taste for sure.  Personally I like a straight narrative in a movie but that's not what this is about. It is about pictures and a young man's search for the answer to a mystery which becomes not important to the director in the end. However it was 1966 when this movie came out and it was different so it does still stand up as great movie of it's type. And it does have excellent actors in it; the late david hemmings and a young sexy  vanessa redgrave put in strong performances here,  and it includes a great cameo from the great rock band the yardbirds in which Jeff Beck blows up and smashes his guitar in anger.  So if you are looking for a straight storyline don't look here but if you are into arty image driven movies in which characters search for things then this one may be to your liking. This is a historical artifact too as it gives us a view of what was considered very avante garde in the midsixties.
0385504225|2.0|Man, what a let down this latest book from Dan Brown was.  I've been waiting 5 years to be blown away.  But this book is almost a carbon copy of the plot of The Davinci Code.  You have a hero, a villian and a complex set of puzzles and codes to be broken with a predictable twist at the end.  Unless you're interested in a brilliant description of the Masons and what they do, I would not recommend this book.  The next five years should be interesting for Dan Brown.  I hope he can produce something more original next time.
0545123267|4.0|After reading a lot of Sookie Stackhouse books, it was nice to get away from vampires for awhile and read about werewolves.<br /><br />Shiver is the story of Grace, and Sam, the wolf she sees every winter, with his hypnotic yellow-gold eyes. But in the summer, Grace does not see her wolf. That is because when the weather is warm, Sam changes back into his human form. Sam and Grace have been watching each other for years, though Grace had no idea what her wolf is. She does not notice Sam in his human form until one cold autumn day, he is shot by hunters looking to kill all the wolves, after a teenager is killed by them. Once Sam is shot, he changes to his human form.<br /><br />Sam's story, the story of all the werewolves is a sad one. Their loved ones think they are dead, and they only have so many years of changing back to human form until one day they will not be able to do so anymore. Sam is certain that the year he finally gets to be with Grace is his last before he changes to wolf forever. Grace is determined to keep Sam in human form, hiding him in her house from her parents and avoiding the cold at all costs. Cold weather causes the change back to wolf. Other wolves have tried moving to warmer climates but it doesn't keep them human. Grace and Sam are desperate to stay together, but they have to worry about Jack, the boy from school, not really killed, but turned and his sister, who is looking for the truth.<br /><br />Sam gives Grace the love and attention that she misses from her very busy and distracted parents.<br /><br />I really liked the novel, including the end (which I won't tell you!), though I have read reviews by bloggers that did not like it.<br /><br />The story moves seamlessly back and forth between Grace and Sam's point of view. It is a beautiful and touching love story. Though it is paranormal, Shiver is not scary in any way. There are some teen sex scenes with Grace and Sam but nothing too graphic.Though I'm not really sure what is appropriate for a YA.  All in all, an enjoyable read that I definitely recommend.<br /><br />my rating 4/5enjoyable read that I definitely recommend.      my rating 4/5
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This was the last studio album that was released during Cash's life.  As with most prolific artists this will not be the LAST album to be released with his name on the cover.  But for me this was it.  You can almost hear the life escaping this man as he pours his heart and soul into these tracks.  As far as I know the only original track on here is the titular \\"The Man Comes Around\\"  This is a stunningly simultaneously dark and crisp narrative about \\"the man\\" an agent of God who is making the final tallies for Judgment Day.<br /><br />The other tracks are all covers.  I love the way he warbled through Bridge Over Troubled Water, it was epic in scope.  I was surprised to find \\"I Hung My Head\\" to have originally been a David Bowie song, but Cash puts his mark on it.  The rest of the tracks are not as strong as the ones above, but add to the overall mood, the feeling of finality to the work.<br /><br />That is except of course for brave, vulnerable, soulful and heart wrenching cover of the Nine Inch Nails track \\"Hurt\\".  This is one of those tracks that begs to be heard.  Crank it all the way up to 11.  This is a powerful ballad, the lyrics which Cash subtly changed to make it seem more personal.  Once you have seen the video that was created for this track you can't help but picture June looking over his shoulder as he belts out this mea culpa to her and to his fans.  When you realize that June had passed before this video was released it takes on a whole other-worldliness.<br /><br />This album is not just for country fans, I should know, I am not a country music fan. This is an album for those who enjoy music and all the emotion that it can bring.  One warning, my dad described listening to Cash on this album as \\"... it was like he had forgotten how to sing.\\"  I can completely see his point, but for me that is what strengthens it.  It is raw.  It is decidedly unpolished.  And for me it was and is spectacular.<br /><br />T
0061914177|5.0|If you know Gary in anyway, this book is Gary speaking directly to you. It like having a private meeting, and getting all your questions answered.  He brings all the different types of New Media to you and explains how you can use them. GREAT BOOK!
0385504225|5.0|Many of us enjoy reading a good book for escapism.  We look for a book with a good plot, a \\"who done it\\" that we can't figure out until the last minute, a book with a secret where the good guys are people like us or our friends (or at least what we would like to be seen as.)  We like books where the bad guys are the opposite of us, those folks who do things we could never even dream of doing. But Dan Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol\\" isn't just a good book, it's a great book.  In this book, Brown raises some questions that make us a little uncomfortable.  Do we ever know those around us as they really are?  Are they putting on an act just for us?  Dan Brown's \\"bad guy\\" is just that kind of person that many people had complete faith in, assuming him to be the \\"right kind\\" of man.  He was trusted with Masonic secrets but in reality was anything but a person to be trusted.    Now let's talk about the \\"good guys.\\"  Robert Langdon from \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is back in this book, still reading the codes.  He then draws on his expertise in ancient codes and symbols so that sometimes he is able to understand what others have seen for years and never deciphered.  Other times Robert has to be helped along by keepers of the secrets (or of only one part of the secret.)  Speaking of secrets, Dan uses the biggest keeper of secrets, the Masons, to tie everything together.      This book took me back to eighth grade where my love of mathematics prompted me to join the math club where we tried to solve various types of codes.  Once you became a good code breaker the messages were easy to read.  It all depended on logic, observation and sometimes just luck.  Dan has this in the book but at the genius level and codes that have been around for thousands of years - codes within codes - secrets within secrets.  WOW!    The setting for the book is Washington D. C.  I've never been there, but even before reading this book I had it listed as a place that I would like to visit someday.  Now I want toread the book again with pen and paper, making a list of all the places that Dan writes about with their obvious purpose and then with their hidden agenda.  If half the people who read this book start making travel plans to visit DC in the next two years and carry them out, DC certainly won't need a stimulus package.    Dan's book is fast paced taking place in only ten hours for the main body of action.  It's been a long time since I have read a book with this much taking place in this short of a time span.  You won't want to put the book down even when it is over.  Make sure you have a couple of days to put aside for just YOU and pure enjoyment.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Bruce still has the energy to rock n roll on the Magic CD.  The CD starts off with the fierce rocker Radio Nowhere.  You'll Be Comming Down keeps the pace going strong as well.  As a matter of fact its mostly rockers at the beginning.  My favorite track is clearly Girls In Their Summer Clothes.  The arrangmeents on that track just do it for me as the keyboards fills are very captivating.  There are more ballads at the end such as the hidden track Terry's Song with its gripping lyrics.  That doesn't mean the CD gets worse, it just means that we see the softer side of the Bruce man.  And there is nothing wrong with that.  This CD is a good one almost on the level of The Rising.
B0026IBXBO|5.0|The movie followed the book to a T. Dan Brown can write anything and turn it into a controversial best seller. He has done it before and Soon Will again, I am sure!

0061914177|5.0|I am not sure what more I can say about this book but I'm going to try and say a few things anyways.<br /><br />This book changed my life. PERIOD. Now I know that sounds maybe a little corny or cheesy but it hit me HARD.<br /><br />I've been following Gary for about a year and a half now only through WIneLibrary.tv - around mid 2008 I started to follow his business words. When \\"Crush It\\" came out, I still wasn't sure but I decided to buy a copy anyways.<br /><br />I sat down to read the book and finished it in about 3 hours. It changed my life. I emailed Gary and let him know right away.<br /><br />Here's the thing. I've been making very good money for many years. VERY good. I've done very very well. But something about Gary's words hit me hard to the point I was willing to give it up and start over.<br /><br />Gary's message is simple:<br /><br />1) Love Your Family<br />2) Work Super hard<br />3) Live your passion<br /><br />So here's the thing. I love my family. I work super hard but was I really living my passion?<br /><br />Tough one to answer. Yes and No.<br /><br />Living my passion in a sense that I'm self employed and could work from where I want and when I want.<br /><br />I'm an entrepreneur at heart. I've been starting businesses since I was seven and pulling a little red wagon filled with soda around the local marina, to crushing it in stamps and baseball cards, becoming an eBay powerseller, to building highly profitable websites...<br /><br />But I realized I'm wasnt living my passion to the extent where I was building and leaving the legacy I wanted to leave for my kids.<br /><br />Legacy.<br /><br />Hit me the hardest. Not in terms of monetary legacy but the things my kids and grandkids  are going to see that I did in my life. Everything we do in our lifetime is permanent.<br /><br />I emailed Gary that night and let him know I was willing to give up all the money I make to live more closely aligned with his 3 simple suggestions. Gary responded right away. Class act.<br /><br />That week I drove to Toronto to meet Gary. I had two opportunities to talk with him.<br /><br />First, we chatted in an elevator and Gary said a few things that solidified my thoughts moving forward. Then I spoke to Gary again where he said a few kind words and gave me a few tidbits of advice.<br /><br />But Gary is relentless.........<br /><br />When I got home I decided I wanted to purchase 35 copies to give out to friends, family and donate to local HIgh Schools.  (if this book was around when I was in High School I would have saved about 15 years of grief)<br /><br />Gary goes on to thank me two more times.<br /><br />First, he thanks me live on UStream and then emails me again thanking me a second time. To which I replied, \\"Gary, you already thanked me...\\" Gary wrote back \\"I know, I wanted to do it again.\\"<br /><br />I've never met someone live by the words they've written more than this guy. There isn't an ounce of B.S. in the book. It's raw, real and the author lives it every single day.<br /><br />It would be hard to find someone else living this true and honest to their words.<br /><br />The book's concept is really simple and the author is living it.<br /><br />Since reading the book I've begun to crush it on all levels. This book will no doubt allow you to cash in on your passion.<br /><br />I know I will.<br />IN two weeks I've made bigger moves and strides than I have in the past few years. (even though I made a lot of money in those years)<br /><br />While not meant to be a motivational book, this book will kick your ass off the couch and get you into gear.<br />And if it doesn't, let Gary know... He'll probably come to your house and return your money personally.<br /><br />Some people look at the book strictly as a way to make more money and utilize the social media tools...But there is a deeper message to this book. Find it and you'll win every time. Guaranteed.<br /><br />35 copies cost me $401.45 - a true bargain for what you'll learn in the short 150 pages or so.<br /><br />Crush it folks. Seriously.

0553584537|2.0|I usually enjoy Lisa Gardner's books , and know a certain amount of suspension of disbelief is required, but the behavior of the protagonist Bobby is just plain unbelievable.    He kills a man righteously in the line of duty and because of some obscure law is being sued criminally by the man's parents.  Can such a law really exist?  How would the police ever be able to do their job?  The father-in-law an incredibly rich and powerful judge.  Of course!    So what does our hero do?  He meets the widow openly in a public museum.  He goes to the judge's house when beckoned, where he is offered a bribe.  He goes to the wife's house when she says she hears an intruder, finding the nanny dead, hung in a blatantly fake suicide.  He tells the widow the suicide is faked before he calls the police.     Nope, no way i can get past all that.  Especially when the wife is thoroughly unlikeable.  All the women in the book are, actually.
0307716988|5.0|I enjoyed reading and getting to know Michael Jackson better.  At times I can actually hear his voice by just reading the words.  If you are a fan or just liked how he performed, I would take the time to read it and get to know him a little better.  Sheds light behind this introverted, shy soul who could only break out of his shell when he was performing or when he was with people that went through what he did as a child.  There is no doubt in my mind that he was a very lonely man and that makes me sad because he was known by virtually everyone and he gave all that he had freely because he had a heart and cared.  He was a gentle human being and he was made to look like a monster when he wasn't.  There is no doubt in my mind that the media contributed to his loneliness and kooky behavior...and ultimately destroyed him.  I question all the charges that were ever brought about him, I question all the things the media wrote about him and I question the integrity of most of the people that he had around him on a daily basis because there is no doubt in my mind that he was innocent and that people just wanted a piece of him and his money, no matter what they were willing to do in order to get it.  I pray that he is finally at peace.
0718152433|5.0|I read some of the negative reviews so I checked this book out at the library first. This is a great book for people that enjoy cooking, gardening, (regardless of where you live!)and it is fun to just read... I have already tried some of the recipes and loved them. The Roasted peppers stuffed with the tomatoes, capers, etc on sourdough was awesome! and soooooo easy!! My husband who is strictly meat and potatoes actually complimented this dish. The book inspired me to get back to cooking. I am not big on fancy recipes and tend to make variations to almost all recipes anyhow so I really liked the way this was written. When I create something new and write it out for friends I write it the way I cook it. I thoroughly enjoy the \\"How I grow\\" sections since he tends to try to grow things just about anywhere including in buckets or soup cans! This inspired me to not be so picky about things being \\"just right\\". I really liked the concept of the book being in order of season since I was looking for something new to do with Squash and Zucchini. Great buy but as always depends on what you are looking to do.
0307716988|5.0|The book is great!! It's nice to read something wrote by Michael, instead all these books wrote by people who thinks to know his life. Besides, the design is amazing. The book is sign by Michael in the cover with golden letter and inside of the book too. Besides there's a draw about himself made by himself and there are so many photos, all of them with a mention. You can't miss this book!!
141041986X|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Suzanne Collins is a genius, pulling readers into the story with wonderful description and suspense. The characters are well developed, with a touch of romance between the two main characters...but no spoilers.   With the plot line there is bound to be some violence, but it's not over the top, which I thought was great (considering what's on TV these days). The final death scene is a little scary, not something I would recommend for anyone under ten, but it is very short and can easily be cut.   Another plus was the content. Bearing in mind the unsuitable topics in many of today's young adult books, I was very surprised at the complete lack of inappropriate scenes and foul language. Children under thirteen can actually read a young adult book! I believe this could possibly be a Guinness World Record.  The futuristic world Suzanne Collins has created is completely and utterly believable, the characters are engaging, and the plot is just plain AWESOME.   To put it simply: YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!
B001D2AYCI|5.0|I compared this deluxe edition to the Rhino remaster and the deluxe edition has more tape hiss and less over all level, which is probably closer to the original vinyl sound. Rhino sounds good, it has noise reduction to bring down the hiss and compression/limiting to make everything sound at the same loud level, which is perfect for your ipod. Which is best? I prefer the good old analog sound, less compression which gives more dynamic range to the music, but the Rhino release isn't bad like some say. The bonus tracks are fun to listen to, they're mainly instrumental versions, you hear the detail in the instruments which is nice. The quad mix isn't great but interesting to hear surround sound from back then. The artwork and packaging are nice too. Enjoy!
B001NFRA90|5.0|Wow! Why did it take so long for this gem to be released? If there was any \\"sweetening\\" that took place back at the ranch, i can't detect it. One night? One show? Sure wish I'd gotten the memo about this gig. Hard to believe that Emmerson and Hughes, whose respective bands ELP and Deep Purple co-headlined California Jam in 1974, are \\"reduced\\" to playing what is basically a club date a quarter century later.     What folks need to know is that Hughes is peaking NOW, producing outstanding solo material that stretches far beyond the long shadow of his brief Deep Purple stint. And, while Emmerson is currently battling a disabling issue that prevents him from touring, his recorded output in the last decade or so is terrific. Both artists have worked with Marc Bonilla, who has carved out a niche by teaming with all sorts of \\"recovering\\" musicians, most recently (for me) original Chicago drummer Danny Seraphine with his \\"California Transit Authority project.\\" Keyboard player Ed Roth is ubiquitous on recordings by these artists too. Clearly a formula that results in \\"keeper\\" music from all concerned.    I'm almost ashamed now to admit I lost track of Hughes and Emmerson during the '80s and '90s, while complaining that there was precious little quality music to be found. Guess I just wasn't looking hard enough! Now, I'm playing catch-up, and can attest that every back catalog and new title released by these artists is a heart-and-soul affair that will not disappoint.
1906694168|4.0|A friend sent me a copy of The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (ordered from the UK) which is the last book in the Millenium trilogy by Swedish Author Stieg Larsson. This final book in the trilogy picks up where the second book, The Girl Who Played With Fire leaves off. It's over 600 pages and gets bogged down in details now and then but it's still a very gripping novel. We are able to follow Salander as she faces her past head on and ends up barely holding on to her own life. Mikael puts the pieces together and helps solve a mystery related to a hidden group that has protected one man and themselves amongst high government security. Larsson's writing style is rich and detailed and is strongly character driven. There are definitely disturbing parts to this novel as in the others that are graphic and violent in nature, so be forewarned if this is something that bothers you. From what I've read about Larsson, I believe it was his intent to bring attention to the issues of violence against women that he must have believed was a societal issue as well as government corruption. This was a common thread throughout the Millenium Trilogy.<br /><br />I found Lisbeth Salander to be the most interesting character in the series. She was a strong, quirky, unique and feisty character. She endured a childhood of abuse and tragedy that was horrific and continued into her adulthood. In the toughest situations she endured and fought and never gave up her fight for truth. She was resilient and intelligent and even referred to as possibly having Aspergers Syndrome which would explain some of her social challenges and genius level abilities with computers.<br /><br />Sadly, Stieg Larsson died before the Millenium Trilogy was published. I will miss reading more about the characters and some storylines that were left hanging and we will never know the answers to...one especially is what happened to Lisbeth's twin sister Camilla. We are left to our imaginations now.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I also saw this in a theater and when it was over, it was clear no one wanted to leave the room, we all would have been content to spend the rest of the afternoon and evening with these 3 guys. One of my fav moments is when Jimmy Page starts the opening notes of Whole Lotta Love - the looks on the Edge's face, and Jack White's face in particular are priceless: they are trying to maintain you know, professional demeanor, but inside they're going \\"OMG it's Jimmy Page playing Whole Lotta Love!!!!\\" I am buying this for a bunch of people on my list, and a copy for me too, to watch all over again.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a GREAT jumpstart to getting in the habit of an exercise routine.  For a bit of background, I am 5'5\\" and weigh(ed) 244lbs when I started two weeks ago.  While I was an athlete and very active when I was younger, about 6 years ago I had a series of pretty serious accidents and injuries (several in cars and was crashed through a fence and rolled on by a horse) that put the screaming brakes on any kind of exercise for awhile.  And let me tell you, when you're used to eating anything and everything in order to fuel an 8-12 hour day of working outside HARD...and then you keep eating like that when you're doing NOTHING...it's easy to pack on 60lbs almost overnight it seems.  Then moving to work in a hospital (JUNK FOOD GALORE!!!!) in one of the fattest, most out of shape cities in the U.S. for the past 4 years has not helped.      ANYWAY, I just wanted all the \\"beginners\\" to know where I'm coming from - haven't exercised regularly or hard (several false starts over the years) in 6 years and have 100+lbs to lose.  The only regular exercise I do is walk my dogs for an hour a day.  That being said, I found this ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE to do the first 3 days...I kept at it as much as I could, but I did take quite a few \\"5 second\\" breaks with water.  However, by day 4 - YES!!!!!!  I was shaking, and I was dying, and after it was over and I flopped on the floor I had 220lbs of worried dog all over me wondering if they were going to have to try and dial 911 :)  As I am on week 2, I have lost 10lbs.  The last 2 days I have done away with the \\"modifiers\\"...although I am somewhere between the two back-up girls intensities.  I have not had any knee problems, and I work out in front of a mirror (yuck) to check my form...but I would think if you are someone who HAS an existing knee injury or other physical problem probably you should be under the supervision of a physical therapist and/or other medical professional instead of jumping around on your own and hurting yourself.  As someone who came back from some pretty serious injuries I can say it's best to have the professionals there by your side.      For those of you who don't have time - HA!!!  This is 25 MINUTES...and if you really push, it does work.  For myself I cut the a.m. dog walk to a half hour, come home after that and do this (so I don't get up any earlier), then have started walking the half hour to work (instead of a 20-25 min trolley ride), walking home another half hour, then take the dogs out for another half hour or so.  So basically this DVD and adding an hour of walking a day (the new on foot commute) and eating well has lost me 10lbs in 2 weeks.      Thank you Jillian for giving me something short enough to stick to every day for the first few weeks, and hard enough to kick some butt and feel changes FAST!!!!  Here's to getting to Level 2!
B0013KUL8M|5.0|Imagine a child who was born on a ship, in 1900, and never set foot on land in his life, yet learns to be a world class jazz piano player from listening to a few scratchy 78 records brought on board by passengers and crew. This is the oddball life of \\"1900\\", the title character, played very well by Tim Roth. He becomes a word of mouth draw for transatlantic travelers, such that even the self-described 'worlds greatest piano player' AKA Jelly Roll Morton, must come and see him...just to KNOW who's best.     Challenged by 1900's abilities, they have a 'cutting session',   each in turn trying to beat the other, and...   well you can find out how this ends. I ain't tellin'!    It is wonderfully shot and narrated, and one of my favorite movies,   with music as central but not over-ridding the personal story.     A movie  I have long tried to get here in Thailand, and had to send   a Euro zone 2 cd to my sister to send to me. But I liked this movie enough to do that just to see it again.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|It's hard to put into words just how riveting this documentary is. If you are a fan of Led Zeppelin, U2, or Jack White (who I had never heard of before this film) you will want to watch this over and over. Some of the coolest parts: watching the Edge as he listens to old tape of U2 giving birth to a song, complete with Bono faintly counting time in the background; watching Jimmy Page put a 45 on a turntable and play air guitar in his home to one of his early influences - the 1958 hit The Rumble; watching Jack White build an electric guitar in the opening scene, and just being delighted overall at this \\"young\\" guy's appreciation for the blues and his talent as a musician.     My favorite band is Led Zeppelin, my wife's is U2, so this film would have had to absolutely fall on its face for us to not like it. But even as excited as we were, as high as our expectations were, and as much as this film had to live up to in our eyes, it did, and more!
B00177YA1K|5.0|People go through life oblivious to the reality around them. As pointed out in this movie, at one time everyone knew the world was flat; and now everyone knows we are alone in the universe. But what if we are wrong? Who will protect us? &quot;Men in black used to be the term for the bad guys. This movie shows they are our last line of defense. This is a fun movie and there are many great actors to add to the fun.<br /><br />Every one is so busy watching Tommy Lee Jones make his stoic looks and Will making one-liners that they miss the person that hold it all together.  In addition, that person has to do act throughout the movie in an Edgar suit.  Have you ever tried one on?  Vincent D'Onofrio has to look unnatural and act natural.  This was one movie where I felt sorry for the bug.  He even drops his snack (Linda Fiorentino) near the end.  It just shows that bugs lead a hard life.<br /><br />If you are into recent bug movies, look for &quot;Out There&quot; where they mention bugs in a rug<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JKZ3 Men in Black II (Widescreen Special Edition)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:6303965954 Out There [VHS] ~ Bill Campbell, Wendy Schaal ]]

B000EHQTZO|5.0|The original King Kong (1933) is very impressive considering it came out in 1933.  This is a black and white movie with very impressive special effects.  It stars Robert Armstrong, Bruce Cabot, and scream queen Fay Wray as Kong's female obsession.  This movie has it all - a giant ape, a good looking damsel in distress, a lost isle with dinosaurs and native inhabitants, and New York City.<br /><br />I like the 1976 remake, but nothing beats the original.  Haven't seen the 2005 Peter Jackson remake.  Some of the things I noticed about the 1933 movie is that Tyrannosaurus Rex walks completely upright.  This is the old school way of thinking.  In recent decades it has been suggested that T Rex probably walked hunched over, with its back pretty much parallel to the ground.  This shows how old this movie is, but at the same time it's fascinating to see this.  At times Kong appears two dimensional, but this is completely acceptable because this was 1933 technology.  Kong fights and kills several dinosaurs, including T Rex, a raptor, and a serpent-like creature.  The battle between Kong and T Rex is epic and goes on for quite some time.  You'll also see a Stegosaurus and a Brontosaurus, although Kong does not battle either one.  When Kong is brought to New York City, he escapes captivity and goes on a rampage.  The finale to the movie where Kong climbs to the top of the Empire State Building and battles biplanes that are shooting at him is classic.<br /><br />Compared to Jessica Lange in the 1976 version, Fay Wray is pretty much terrified of Kong for the whole movie, whereas Jessica Lange warmed up to him quite a bit.<br /><br />Special features of this DVD include audio commentary by Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston (visual effects) and interpolated interview excerpts of producer and director Merian C. Cooper and Fay Wray.  This movie has been restored and digitally mastered for a clear picture and sound.<br /><br />If you want to watch a classic monster/horror movie that is still well respected three quarters of a century after its release, then see the original King Kong.  I first saw it on TV when I was probably five years old and I still think its great.  So will you.rters of a century after its release, then see the original King Kong.  I first saw it on TV when I was probably five years old and I still think its great.  So will you.
0385504225|4.0|In his follow-up to the mega-best-selling The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown has produced what is essentially a love letter to the Masonic Order combined with a humanistic New Age manifesto, thinly disguised as a genuinely entertaining ticking-clock thriller.<br /><br />When Robert Langdon arrives in Washington to deliver an address at an awards dinner at the urgent request of his friend and mentor Peter Solomon, he discovers he has been duped; not only is there no dinner, but Peter has been kidnapped, and Langdon's presence in the capital is not to deliver a speech but to assist the kidnapper in decoding a series of Masonic codes supposedly leading to a cache of hidden wisdom. As Langdon deciphers layer after layer of an increasingly complex code, he must draw upon his vast but incomplete knowledge of Masonic lore in hopes of saving his friend's life before it's too late. Working with him are the director of the CIA's Security Office, who insists that what Langdon is about to uncover is somehow related to national security, and Peter's sister, a beautiful and brilliant noetic scientist on the verge of discovering a tangible link between human thoughts and material reality, including the existence of the soul.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is every bit as readable as The Da Vinci Code while even more intense and possibly more controversial. The writing is engaging, the characters are rich and well-supplied with interesting back-stories, and the action is practically nonstop. Brown clearly undertook a monumental research project in preparation for writing; readers are inundated with a wealth of information about Masons, noetic science, and New Age mysticism, though as in Brown's previous books the line between fact and fiction is rather blurry at times. The book takes place almost entirely in Washington, D.C., and readers will enjoy experiencing the buildings, symbols, and myths of the U.S. capital from a new perspective.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, traditional Christianity (along with Judaism, Hinduism , and Islam) is portrayed as at best backward and uninformed and at worst downright deceptive. Masons, on the other hand, are the enlightened protectors of sacred knowledge, and those who embrace the concept that God is within us all are on the path to true fulfillment. Brown's treatment of the Masonic Order is unequivocally positive, although his descriptions of Masonic rituals paint them in an undeniably sinister light even as he defends their motives. The book contains no sexual content and minimal foul language, but the stark evil of the villain along with depictions of ritual sacrifice, bizarre ceremonies, and sadistic torture and murder make the story much darker than either of the two previous books in the series.<br /><br />The pace lags a bit toward the end as Brown lapses into preacher mode, working his characters into a frenzy of pseudo-spiritualism that contributes little other than to make one wish the book had ended a few chapters earlier. Nevertheless, as an example of how to communicate what could have been pedantic and esoteric information in a thoroughly engaging way, The Lost Symbol succeeds brilliantly.ism , and Islam) is portrayed as at best backward and uninformed and at worst downright deceptive.

0882709194|1.0|This book is not, as Ray Comfort alleges, a word for word reproduction of Darwin's original Origin of Species.  In the first printing, he omitted whole chapters (four, to be exact).  In the second printing, he included those chapters but chose to omit various diagrams and other supporting evidence included by Darwin in his original publishing as evidence for his theory.  Additionally, the 50 page introduction by Ray Comfort is in large part plagiarized from the work of Dr. Stan Guffey.<br /><br />Even if you're a theist looking to explore Darwin's work, do not waste your money on this book.  Ray Comfort has borne false witness against Darwin in his omission of vital material, and he violates the Commandment against theft when he steals the work of Dr. Guffey without permission or attribution.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|After the first ten minutes of the first episode of \\"Breaking Bad,\\" I was confused. But from then on the plot unfolded with a bang. It is so well-written with plenty of twists and turns, with mixed-in drama and humor, that I was hooked. Every character is perfectly cast and played. I couldn't believe that Bryan Cranston was the same man who played the idiot father in \\"Malcolm in the Middle.\\" Each episode has its own mini-plot, often seemingly unsolvable.     My only criticism is that there are only seven episodes per season.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I like zombie stuff and this move has that along with some very funny scenes.  Really funny.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Wow.  This is an impressive venture.  For about the first 14 minutes, there is no talking whatsoever, just Daniel Day-Lewis mining alone for oil in the middle of nowhere, but that time is well spent and there's never a dull moment.  In fact, what you see in that quiet beginning foreshadows what lengths Day-Lewis's character, Daniel, will ultimately go to in order to protect himself and his company.  For the most part, I understood why Daniel behaved as he did throughout the movie, lying to, killing and rejecting those around him.  Daniel is, generally speaking, a likeable character until he eventually goes off the rails toward the end, a selfish man alone with his money.  Daniel Day-Lewis gives an outstanding performance here, totally Oscar-worthy.  The guy really knows his art.
B002AR9YPI|4.0|One of the most original and haunting albums I've heard in quite a while. It's contemporary and nostalgic at the same time. Maybe a mix of Radiohead and King Crimson? It's hypnotic and I'm finding something new to appreciate with each listen.
0316044938|4.0|A teen girl was raped and murdered -  her soul soars to a land this side of heaven.  She's created a comfortable place to reside while watching her family frantically search and as they learn to accept her death years later.  She has other spirits surrounding her along with a \\"mentor\\" helping her along.  This is Susie's middle ground, a place to allow her to accept her abrupt death and her life after death - and she's telling us her story - from the dead side.     It's  interesting looking down from above.  I believe the author wanted to take us through the grieving process from the dead victim's point of view.   Susie remains in this \\"heaven\\" watching how her death effects everyone associated with her, including her family and murderer.   Yes, her murderer.  Susie takes us through the murder from beginning to end - she meets others that came to this same fate by the same hand.  He's a meticulous, disciplined serial killer that is a strange man but nothing points to him as a suspect.  Her father knows this 'neighbor' did it - even though there's no real proof.      This is where I felt Susie's frustration most.  Her father is going mad, her mother is shutting herself down, her siblings and the remainder of her friends are all going through their own private hells and Susie can't tell them a thing. She can only watch as it plays out in front of her like a movie on the big screen.      Susie just can't seem to let go of her past life.  In the end, her murder brought unlikely pairs together and tore others apart and put them back together again.  It's my opinion that Susie remained in that slice of heaven for years attempting to adjust to being dead AND to make sure the living adjusted too.  Only after this could she be at peace and move on to the next level of heaven.    We know how much we miss those that we've lost and now this book tells us how much those that are gone miss us too....This story was so true to life on so many levels.  From helplessness and emptinessof family and friends to the inner workings of a serial killer's mind.
0385522401|5.0|On Chesil Beach made me think for days of the poor souls who just couldn't quite complete their connection with each.  About half way through the story, I was a little unsure of the path the book would take but at that defining moment my heart burned for them to figure each other out.  The resulting frustration and inability to communicate ruined a future for these tragic souls.  Her walk down the beach, alone, made me yearn for someone's action.  For both of them 9C will always be empty, just like their hearts.

B0029LHW4U|3.0|What made Layne Staley so vital to Alice In Chains? He had a unique vocal style that inspired many imitators. But in addition to being distinctive, it was versatile. He manipulated his voice in creative ways; one example is \\"Grind\\" from the 1996 [[ASIN:B000002B8A self-titled album]], where his vocal twists into a cadaverous, menacing snarl on the verses. Moreover, though Jerry Cantrell wrote most of the music, Staley brought a certain flamboyant weirdness to the band's sound. He had a background in glam-rock, which gave him a taste for indie theatrics. This created an interesting tension with Cantrell's more bluesy, rootsy style. It also led Cantrell himself to get a little deeper into that style, with detailed acoustic guitar playing and other instruments such as harmonica. All this made Alice In Chains a lot more quirky and creative than the grunge-metal label might suggest.    Unfortunately, those odd, underground quirks left with Staley, and are mostly absent from Black Gives Way To Blue. For a reunion album made after the death of the lead singer, it is not bad, and packs a few solid AIC thrills. The self-titled album already had a lot of murky, undistinguished music, so it's not impossible to live up to their old standard. But the self-titled album also had some unpredictable, bizarre Staley inventions, like the delirious rant at the end of \\"Frogs,\\" and it occasionally shook up the tempo with a loud, harsh anthem like \\"Grind\\" or \\"God Am.\\"    By contrast, Black Gives Way To Blue mostly consists of sludgy, drawn-out tracks. Even the single \\"Check My Brain\\" is kind of slow, and the chorus is drawn out without much rhythmic structure in the vocals. Compare this to the tight, harsh stomp of \\"Grind\\" or the bass hook in \\"Would?\\" and you'll see the difference. Of course, AIC always had a slow sludgy side -- their classic album [[ASIN:B0000028M7 Dirt]] is full of meandering half-jams like \\"Rain When I Die.\\" But even those tended to have strong riffs and choruses. The riffs in Black Gives Way To Blue are really self-similar. The crashing riff in \\"Check My Brain\\" isn't really that different from the one in \\"Last Of My Kind\\" or \\"Lesson Learned.\\" The one guitar part that stands out a bit is the lead in \\"Take You Out,\\" with a slightly more light-hearted tone than usual.    The production is slick, but makes some songs sound a bit thin, especially the first two tracks, where the guitars sort of buzz without the crushing heaviness that we all expect from AIC songs. Yet, the vocals in these same songs closely follow the flat, brooding style of classic AIC (Cantrell sings \\"oh yeah\\" with that old drawl), creating a sense that they're going for the old style but not quite getting it. However, to be fair, there is one song that absolutely nails the classic sound, namely \\"A Looking In View.\\" This song faithfully recreates AIC's trademark oppressively dark pounding, and it sounds awesome.    The band's more subdued side is well represented -- \\"When The Sun Rose Again\\" has down-tuned acoustic strumming that vaguely recalls \\"Heaven Beside You,\\" but the percussion has a certain light touch that is novel, and welcome, in an Alice in Chains song. \\"Your Decision\\" has an arrestingly stern Cantrell vocal. But, these songs have a more streamlined radio sound, compared to the oddity of the classics. (I always thought it was strange that \\"Heaven Beside You\\" was a hit, with that strange guitar loop that sounds like it was recorded in some backwoods swamp.)    There's a new singer, William Duvall, taking up Staley's mantle. I was wary when I first heard about this, but he doesn't try to copy Staley, and actually, Cantrell's vocals are dominant -- hearing Cantrell all over the album, I even wondered why he bothered finding a new singer. Duvall's most prominent role is on \\"Last Of My Kind,\\" where he shows a strong voice for conventional singing and screaming, but without Staley's theatrical versatility. Once again -- this is a good, but streamlined AIC, glossing over many of the quirks and oddities that made them interesting.    The same can be said of the lyrics. Now, even Staley was often a very muddled writer, and that was never the point of AIC anyway, so the guys don't have to be lyrical geniuses to write a good album. But Staley brought a vulnerable, confessional bent to songs like \\"[[ASIN:B0000029F8 Nutshell]],\\" which reads like a tired man's honest rumination rather than typical rock angst. Now he's gone, but the band is still working with AIC's usual dark moods, so the lyrics have gotten more vague. For instance, \\"Last Of My Kind\\" is a vaguely angry, somewhat generic fight-song describing how Duvall will \\"smash all the temples and crawl through the rubble.\\" [[ASIN:B001UGGVBU Lacuna Coil]] write stuff like this a lot, and it's fine for what it is, but isn't something that one pays much attention to.    Still, Cantrell deserves as much credit as Staley for creating the AIC sound, and he is in great vocal form. The best part of \\"Private Hell\\" is when he sorrowfully hums \\"uh huh, uh huh, uh huh\\" (this kind of wordless chant seems to express the sad backstory of the band better than any lyrics ever could) and he achieves the same brooding tone in \\"Your Decision.\\" Cantrell's vocals are perhaps the album's biggest draw. Repeated listens do bring out a few good guitar solos, as well.    In the end, this album is probably still more varied than anything that AIC's soundalikes could possibly come up with. The best parts of Black Gives Way To Blue are better than the weak parts of the self-titled album. \\"A Looking In View\\" is a great long grind. But there is no song as tight and forceful as \\"Grind\\" or \\"Them Bones,\\" and the vocals lack the theatrical dramatism of the old days. Perhaps it's really more like a Cantrell [[ASIN:B0000655YW solo album]]...
B001PO53IO|5.0|I know, sounds like an exageration, but believe me. This is the finest box set you will ever experience. This is what Blu-Ray is about folks. Fantastic surround sound that encompasses the entire sound field, flawless dialogue tracks, and thunderous bass. Dear God, Star Wars was meant to sound like this. Digital clarity that only Blu-Ray can provide.<br /><br />Our cable company has yet to add Cartoon Network to our HD roster, so what a pure joy to finally see this beautiful animation come to life in all of its glory. The episodes are simply glorious. The colors, the lighting, the depth, the dimension, I just can't believe anyone would say something negative about this presentaion.<br /><br />The packaging is fantatsic as well. Built solid, with amazing texture, and beautiful booklet with early images of the charecters, planets, and crafts, along with fun comments about each. The discs are held in place quite nicley, and the whole set just reflects Lucas perfection!<br /><br />The special features are so in depth, and fascinating. My 7 year old son and I just loved hearing the backstories and realizing how much care goes into every aspect of the charecters and storylines. I know some people just don't accept this new generation of Star Wars. Well, you know what. Thats their loss!<br /><br />I have come to love these charecters, and they are handled with intergrity from the writers. The episode \\"Rookies\\" is one of the most moving stories I have seen in many years. These clones do have personalities, and you hurt for them as they mature and try to fullfill their \\"purpose\\". Yoda is a pure joy in \\"Ambush\\", as he takes on a challenge to defeat a legion of battledroids, while helping 3 clone troopers learn more about who they are, and how to use the force in their own unique way. Plo Kloon also shows his compassion for the clones as he risks his own life in space to save their lives because of how much he values them. The special connection between Anakin and R2 is also explored, as well as his genuine care for Asoka (his young padawan).<br /><br />My son and I love Captain Rex, and Asoka, and really enjoy the appearances by Aurra Sing, Kit Fisto, Plo Koon, Aayla Secura, and so many other fun charecters we only catch little or no glimpse in the films. We are both so psyched for what has been rumored to be Boba Fett's appearance in season 2!<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series, this is simply a must have. If you have been turned off from the series from all of those...well, you know what I mean. Forget them and give it a try. FINALLY, a box set worth every penny!!!!!!!!!ne care for Asoka (his young padawan).

B000C65Z1G|5.0|A good measure of the pleasure in this film derives from its African focus both in sight and sound. Shots of the people in their homeland and recording of their musical heritage provides flavor to many the the scenes. Beyond that we are treated to fine acting by both leads (Fiennes and Weisz) as well as by the supporting cast. The action is taut as first the wife and then the husband search out the link among a number of health organizations engaged in research into the efficacy of a new drug to combat TB. Death, violence, racial intolerance and bureaucratic face-saving are all part of the dramatic stew. Happily, sufficient evidence for alternative interpretations and moral judgments on each lead characters behavior and outlook. Thus we have an interesting film rather than a sermon to the already converted.
1603420398|5.0|I really liked this book.  It is well written and very easy to understand.   In addition to written instructions there are also crochet diagrams of the particular motif being crocheted.  In the past, I have always had issues with crochet diagrams.  This book has certainly helped clear up that problem for me.  The book is also a pleasure to look at as it is colorful and inviting.  Just looking at the cover makes me want to crochet something.  Great job.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Altman with some help on the screenplay and production, and a free hand on direction, makes the most of a delicious script through the efforts of a top notch cast. Set in a British upper class home in the year 1932, a richly drawn set of characters  capture the class distinctions of upstairs and down as an ill-assorted gathering of the upper class and status seekers are engaged in pursuit of contradictory goals while those below stairs take on the identity of their masters and mistresses while engaged in their own status struggles and attempts at gratification.This is a film for leisurely watching so as to savor the verbal and physical interactions. One of the Good Ones.
1601251831|4.0|Good book, except there is no index and the table of contents is lacking. For example the dragons are grouped together in the book, but the only list of monsters in the begining is by monster in alphabetical order (so the dragons are not grouped together). I do like the layout for each entry and Paizo has a lot of useful info in the back e.g. to help new GMs understand levels vs. hit dice, etc. Not that's hard to do, but once again Paizo outshines Hasbro with quality over quantity.
0439023491|5.0|I am so addicted to this series. The second book was just as enthralling as the first. I couldn't put it down. I have nothing but good things to say about it except that when I reached the end I was craving more. It's going to be a long wait until the next book and I think I'm just going to have to read catching fire again because it was just so good. I'd totally recommend this book to anyone craving a story that catches your attention and doesn't let go, even after it's done.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|The Ultimate is a compilation of what could be considered the most representative songs of the Bee Gees in the 50th anniversary of the group. Rhino's remastering makes this compilation much better than those made by Polydor in his previous collections. In the last compilation by Polydor, The Bee Gees - Their Greatest Hits: The Record, the music actually sounds louder but not necessarily better.  Rhino remastering of the songs make them sound more crystalline and without the loud volume used in The Record.<br />The collection itself is great for casual fans that want music in their collection of this band.  And this band without any doubt is one of the most representative of the modern history of music worldwide, the song selection is very successful and when you finish playing the CD the listener is eager to hear more, which is a very good sign.<br />The biggest problem facing by this compilation will be their capacity to attract the usual fans of the band because the songs in this collection have appeared again and again in several previous compilations like Greatest, Number Ones, Love Songs, The Record, and so on. Everything indicates that the record label plans to re-edit over and over again these songs in different packaging in the best style of bands like Kiss, who make so many compilations than the fans have enough of it.  Hopefully, the Gibb brothers do not follow this behavior since eventually ends up disappointing the fans.<br />Hopefully with Mythology Rhino reconsider the selection of songs and make major changes. Only regular fans of the band would purchase a set of 4 discs, but if those discs bring the same songs as always many of these fans will not buy Mythology. I think the song selection in Mythology of Maurice Gibb and Andy Gibb is appropriate since most of these songs are not acquired with ease and are available with the original sound, which is very poor.  To hear Overnight or Wildflower among others, with good remastering is the strength of this compilation of Mythology which attracts regular followers.<br />But the disks representing Barry and Robin need important changes to include older songs that have not been remastered yet as Baby As You Turn Away or Country Lanes, for example or maybe solo songs like Shine Shine, My Eternal Love, Another Lonely Night In NY, Like a Fool, among others, and even better than that, unpublished material!<br />Gibb Brothers and Rhino have the final word; hopefully they realize what the usual fans want, rather than try to sell the same songs over and over again!of Mythology which attracts regular followers.  But the disks representing Barry and Robin need important changes to include older songs that have not been remastered yet as Baby As You Turn Away or Country Lanes, for example or maybe solo songs like Shine Shine, My Eternal Love, Another Lonely Night In NY, Like a Fool, among others, and even better than that, unpublished material!

0393325172|5.0|I loved the film version but had heard of rumblings from loyal fans of O'Brian that the film was a hodge podge assembly of various books.  Having not till now read any of the books, I still loved and own the film.  A friend loaned me this (first book) in the series and having read it now I am fully salted and totally hooked.  What a fabulous author, who has caught the very fragrance of the ocean, all the phrases (none of which I understood) of the sailors as orders are barked fore and aft, of the cycles of calm and tremendous action as naval warfare is blasted at close quarters.  I can hardly wait to chomp down on the other book loaned to me, which is \\"The Far Side of the World\\".  Very highly recommended.....endlessly fascinating characterizations, with even the simplest person well fleshed out.  My only regret is that I had not read O'Brian earlier.....Haul up the Maintopsail, I am going to retrieve more O'brian booty!!!!

0060920084|3.0|Bill Bryson's The Lost Continent is fairly funny and entertaining, but only if you can overlook Bryson's condenscening attitude and repetitive writing style.  Most episodes in the book work something like this:  \\"I went somewhere I probably didn't like, saw some people I didn't like, took in an attraction I thought was tacky, and reminded myself and the reader that I was far better than all of the above.\\"  For the most part, it's another example of unearned Yuppie smugness being passed off as wit; I can almost see Bryson's pinkie sticking out as he drinks latte from a disposable cup.      It didn't help that only a few pages into the book, he describes a visit to a specific location I had also visited at nearly the same time.  Bryson's description of the place was factually untrue, and I felt that Bryson had intentionally, and falsely, savaged a specific place because he thought it would sound funny.  Again, it's not that I felt differently about the place, but that his description of it was simply false.  I felt that called into question all of the subsequent descriptions.    While Bryson's episodes are structurally redundant, his conversational writing style draws in the reader.  When Bryson eases off on his attitude, he is genuinely funny; his descriptions of family vacations are very funny.  It's my understanding that his later works do just that, so I'll probably pick up a Walk in the Woods.
B000051VWW|5.0|It's funny. I haven't written many reviews on Amazon and I honestly waivered between whether I wanted to chime in on how great 2Pac's All Eyez On Me double CD is or how much rock is missing a kick a$$ album like GNR's Appetite for Destruction. After recently watching the Lovers Rock concert DVD I settled somewhere in the middle.    I am a product of the 80's & 90's and I can honestly say that I feel that Sade is in a class all her own. Madonna, Janet, Mariah, Whitney, and the others all are great artist in their own right but Sade's uncompromising and unfaltering sound is truely timesless.    On Lovers Rock Sade does not dissapoint. She elavates her artistry and offers her fans the purest view of her soul that we have ever seen. I believe that this album was released in 1999 and after truely \\"listening\\" to it for the first time in a few years I can see why it takes Sade so long to craft each album. Sade truely pours her heart and soul into her work.     I will not give the track by track break down of songs. All that I will tell you is that if you like I am a TRUE fan of all REAL music then you MUST own this CD. PERIOD! If you don't already own this CLASSIC I strongly recommend that you pick up the DVD/CD combo pack. You won't be disapointed!    Sade, please provide your fans with another work of your masterful art. It's truely LONG over due.
0061649694|5.0|When I first began seeing ads for a movie called \\"Coraline\\" I said to myself, now there's something Tim Burton must be involved in. The eerie, angular characters, the distorted sense of reality, the dark foreboding world the characters inhabit - all of these, to me at least, screamed Burton. But no. This delightfully oddball tale sprang from the mind of none other than Neil Gaiman, a writer with whom I'd been acquainted in-name-only for several years now. Gaiman first came to my attention by way of his association with H.P. Lovecraft, an author he and I share an immense appreciation for. I read his introduction to a collection of Lovecraft stories published by Del Rey and made a mental note to investigate his work. And then some years went by. While shopping at Walmart back in February, I came across a \\"book version\\" of this new movie I'd been hearing about, and lo, I recognized the author's name. It was now the proper time for Gaiman and I to get reacquainted.<br /><br />Coraline tells the story of young Coraline Jones, who relocates to a rather isolated old home who's large rooms and floors have been divided into flats. Her neighbors are, of course, a bit eccentric to say the least and young Coraline spends her first few days exploring the house, grounds and her neighbors and finally exhausts each of these in turn. What is that that is said about idle hands being the devil's workshop? Coraline, hoping for some playtime or at least playtime suggestions from her harried parents, stumbles upon the door to an alternate universe and there our story really takes off.<br /><br />Within the first few pages I was struck by some minor yet noticeable allusions to that greatest of absurb, frightful children's tales: Alice In Wonderland. We have a secret entrance to a world where things don't quite make sense, and a Cheshire cat as our fearless, erm, guide. Their are further allusions along the way, but rest assured this is no mere copycat tale. Gaiman introduces his own brand of wicked vision, his own plot twists and turns, while still maintaining Carrol's sense of the absurd. And Gaiman's poem songs are superb.<br /><br />I recently read a few of Gaiman's short stories from Smoke and Mirrors. These are earlier stories and while some are good, some, to me, show the writer still gaining his footing, attaining his voice. What is striking about Coraline, is the sureness of Gaiman's delivery. His sentence structure is now taught, his descriptions crisp and quick. In S&M, he mentions that one of the stories was inspired by his desire to create a Raymond Carver story. For those unfamiliar with Carver, he wrote in a very terse style, short sentences, deadly sharp, much in the manner of Hemingway. This is what we have here: Gaiman's style distilled to pure essence. Gone are the extensive adverbs and awkward asides that characterized lesser of his early stories.<br /><br />Parents reading this with their children may be struck by the portrayal of Coraline's parents: two humdrum people, their minds perpetually entwined with a glowing pc monitor, their rumps perpetually ensnared in a computer chair. Anytime Coraline asks a question, she is left to feel that she is interrupting, that really her parents have no time for her. While I can sympathize w/ the parents at my ripe old 31 years of age, I can see where many children can identify with this scenario, seemingly screaming yet their parents hear not a peep. This also provides the perfect catalyst for Coraline's departure and initial acceptance of the \\"other\\" mother and father. Compared to the movie, I do feel that parts of Coraline's character reversal in terms of how she views each set of parents was a bit rushed, where it was allowed to develop more gradually in the movie thus seeming more realistic. This said, I must also say I feel that the movie version did a better job, overall, of presenting Gaiman's vision in a way I feel he actually intentioned. But while the movie is astounding, the bookis a fabulous read as well. There are certain insights which Gaiman offers that came only be gleaned from perusing his prose.<br /><br />In closing, I can't think of a book/movie adaption combo that better serve each other. If you've only read the book, be sure to see the movie; if you've only seen the movie, read the book. If you've done both, for heaven's sake, do it again!There are certain insights which Gaiman offers that came only be gleaned from perusing his prose.

1591841666|4.0|This proved to be a very useful read, because it spells out the necessity of determining when you should quit something and when you should pursue it. It's a short book, but you will want to take your time and think about what the author suggests, especially because quitting is so foreign to us. However by spending some time looking at what you are doing and if it's something you can really commit to, you can save yourself a lot of time, money, and effort. I wish I had read this before before I embarked on my ph.d program years ago. It certainly would've saved me a lot of time and effort. In anycase, I highly recommend reading this book, as it will help you prioritize what really matters in your life.
1416594787|5.0|great book, a step by step on evidence for evolution. Note that this is not a attack on religion or is evolution against religion. You can accept evolution and still have a god/gods. Please read the whole book before insulting/ attacking anyone whom disagrees with your personal beliefs.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|we discovered Castle a few weeks ago so we had to see all of the first season.  great cast, sharp, cheeky dialogue, romantic tension and a mystery; who could ask for more?  well, we add a glass of wine and some chocolate and all gather around the tv; then it's perfect.  we love the relationships with Castle and Beckett (of course), but also his mom and especially his daughter.  And we love Ryan and Esposito's banter and Med Examiner Lanie and Captain Montgomery. we just never get tired of shows like this.
045122499X|1.0|Ken Follett may have done a lot of research on medieval buildings, but he obviously did very little research on marriage and families in the 14th century. The utter disregard for historical accuracy eventually jarred and irritated me so much that I skipped several hundred pages of the book.     Some examples:   There is significant discussion between Merthin and Caris about Lolla, Merthin's 16 year old daughter. She is described as being at the age where she is \\"between a child and adult\\" and Caris chides Merthin for assaulting her \\"self-esteem.\\" (Yes, Follett has a character in 14th century England use the phrase \\"self-esteem.\\" Never mind that the concept of self-esteem didn't enter psychology until the late 19th century, at the earliest.)  In fact, the concept of adolescence as the period between childhood and adulthood did not develop until the mid 19th century. There is great concern on Merthin and Caris' part that Lolla may be sexually active. In the 14th century, girls were eligible for marriage at 14. At 16 years old, people might have been asking rather why she wasn't married or at least betrothed.  In the final chapters of the book, the main characters are all in their 40s, portrayed as in the prime of life. In the 14th century, men and women were old at 40. Very few people lived into their 50s or beyond (a little over a century later, Henry VII and Henry VIII were considered old men when they died, both in their early to mid-50s).  The bottom line is that marriage, children, and family relationships in the 14th century were simply not the way Follett portrays them.     None of the main characters is very appealing. Merthin comes closest, but he is very nearly a Mary Sue (or Gary Stu, in this case): brilliant, overcoming one tragic episode after another, misunderstood yet always saving the day (or he would, if it weren't for the jealousy of the lesser beings around him). The rest of the characters are static, never developing, rehashing the same situationsand character flaws over and over without ever learning anything. No explanation, or the thinnest of reasons at best, is given for characters' motivations. Why, for instance, did Ralph lust after Gwenda for decades? Especially when he thought she was ugly. We are simply told that he does and expected to believe it.     There is no actual plot. There is only a series of unfortunate events loosely strung together by the reader's hope that one of these days, the bad guys will get what's coming to them.     I've certainly read worse books, but this is a long book and a serious commitment to make to such a historically inaccurate and unsatisfying story.
1416594787|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It could have all been said more concisely, but that would have been less fun.  It is a great summary of all aspects of the evolutionary process.  I particularly appreciated the treatment of genetics, as I do not have a strong background in that.  Dawkins probably could have been less smug in his teatment of the \\"history deniers\\", but that isn't his style.  The book has many footnotes that offer additional explanation for those with less scientific backgrounds.<br /><br />If you could give half stars, I would give it 4.5!
B001TODCII|3.0|Taken: 6 out of 10: Taken comes this close to being great. It had an admittedly rocky start with Liam Neeson is trying to reconnect with his virginal 17 year-old teenage daughter in a way that seems just on this side of creepy. (Dude get your own girlfriend... really)    Speaking of which; swarthy bad guys, who clearly have never heard of Nancy Grace, are kidnapping Rich American Girls and making them drugged out street walkers or selling them for millions to Arab Sheiks based on whether they are virgins or not.    So ex-CIA estranged father Liam Neeson has 96 hours to find his daughter before she is gone forever deflowered and then burkaized apparently. A Fate Worse than Death you can almost hear the characters thinking.    Its as if Charles Bronson was guest starring in an Ilsa the Wicked Warden film located in George C Scotts Hardcore and the entire enterprise was PG-13. And yet the film still works two thirds through. Liam Neeson is more than fine. He is kicking ass on all cylinders. Its the bad guys that drop the ball.    First a rich French guy starts quoting the Godfather. Its not personal its business For starters the quote isnt even in context. He might as well have told the gun toting Liam Neeson may the force be with you for all the sense it makes. Second of all you cant quote the Godfather without referencing the fact that you are quoting it in the first place. Any screenwriter who does that should be sleeping with the fishes.    The second slap to the head is an Arab Sheik character that looked like he stepped out of a 1940s Bugs Bunny cartoon. Honestly I dont know where to begin on this silly stereotype. Why is he the film? Why does he have a knife to the white virgins throat? Who would Oscar Schindler shoot????    The last point seems important since the Arab is basically a Juden in a dress. Same large noses, same aversion to pork, same living in ghettos in Europe (Or/and having all the money), same secret organizations paying off French politicians, same affinity to despoiling white Aryan virgins... The more things change the more the stay the same I guess. (They didnt have the Arab cook and eat a baby. I guess they are holding that back for the sequel)    Overt French xenophobia aside, Taken is a fun ride for most of the trip. (The dinner with his French policeman friend and Frenchman's wife was a particular highlight) And as I did mention Liam Neeson does kick ass.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Up is a film that everyone will enjoy. It's an adventure that kids will love, and an emotional story that will make you laugh and cry at the same time. I'm waiting to be disappointed by Disney and Pixar's duo, but it has yet to happen. This is just one more magnificent film to add to their list. Up will touch your heart and soul to the core.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I couldn't believe my eyes, Thom Yorke, Death Cab for Cutie, Muse, The Killers, and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club? All on the soundtrack to what is most likely to be one of the worst movies of the year. A sequel to one of the worst films of 2008. Based on a book series that isn't even worthy of being used as toilet paper. Yes you heard right, this soundtrack is downright amazing. The wife purchased it, being a big fan of the movies and books, and when I saw the track listing I had to give it a listen. Nothing Thom Yorke is attached too could possibly suck and I was right. With an eclectic mix of artists the somber mood of the record easily slips from one wonderful track to the next. Even suck artists OK GO managed to surprise me with a very relaxed arrangement that is above and beyond the trash they usually put out. How did this happen? I have no idea but whoever is behind the soundtrack gave New Moon much more than it deserves. Its typical to see so many tweens and tarts opposed to actual good music, so sorry you got suckered into purchasing actual GOOD music. A wonderful collection of songs, its just too bad its the soundtrack to this really stupid movie.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Anyone who has ever seen a PIXAR movie knows that the brilliant people behind the computers make movie enjoyable by everyone! That's right, a kid's movie enjoyable by an adult but with no inapropriate humor to make it happen. Everyone likes PIXAR movies. Even angsty emo teenagers who grumble through the whole thing are secretly touched by their honest storytelling.<br /><br />I've had the same boyfriend for 5 years neow and I have never ONCE seen him cry in a movie. I, on the other hand, cry at the drop of the hat. Of course I'm crying through the for 5 minutes of the movie, but I look over at my boyfriend and see *GASP* he too is crying! But don't worry parents! This movie is not overly sad. PIXAR knows what is neccisary in a story and how to tell it tastefully. The first 5 - 10 minutes is rather sad, but it is a natural part of life.<br /><br />Of course the rest of the movie is pure genius. I'm always surrounded by dogs and they nailed the personality of the dogs perfectly. From their frequent distractions to their frightening intensity when on the hunt. Kevin is also delightful and the boy is easy to relate to.<br /><br />The only thing that really shocked me in this movie was the demise of the villan. ***SPOILER*** I am terrified by heights and when I watched him slide of the side of the balloon and fall to the earth I felt my stomach go somewhere far away ***SPOILER*** While this is rather shocking it's really the only way for this story to end.<br /><br />People with younger kids may find themselves explaining death to their toddler, but this is a talk we all need to have with out kids at some point. Other than that, UP! was delightful! I laughed, I cried, I found myself quoting the movie for many months afterwards. Thank you John Lasseter
B000VSBX34|2.0|Disjointed, sophomoric, and joyless, \\"Help!\\" is a major step back from the far more satisfying \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".    The movie's only saving grace is its music, but you may find yourself getting really restless waiting for the next musical number to begin.
B00006HYQ5|5.0|I stumbled on one of these little mice at work, quite by accident; my ergonomically correct mouse died, and I bought a fancy optical, cordless one which left my fingers numb and/or painful from using it only a couple hours, even though it was advertised as ergonomically designed.  One of my coworkers wanted the optical, cordless mouse, so I offered to trade it for her little travel mouse.  Since using the travel mouse, fully 75% or more of the problems with my carpal tunnel have ended.  I'm sold and am now going to buy one for my home computer, as well.  (The problem for carpal tunnel sufferers, for those who don't know, is that arching the hand over a large mouse or track ball device tends to place the hand at a 45 degree angle to the wrist, further stressing the carpal tunnel, pinching the nerves and causing either pain or numbness and stiffness.  Because this mouse is so tiny it fits nicely in the cup of your hand, it doesn't require your wrist to flex while using it.  Combined with my gel wrist rest, it's a total winner!)
0451213092|3.0|As others have already noted, this is not a typical Follett book. It is an interesting read, however, for anyone who wants to get a first-hand perspective of what Iran was like during the revolution.    My sense is that some aspects of the tale, especially all of the narrow escapes and the doggedness of the Iranian official who was cast as the villain, were embellished quite a bit to make the book more interesting.    It isn't the most engrossing of reads, but I've seen worse. If Follett had been given a free hand in how the final product was presented, it would have been much better. Perot's fingerprints are all over the place, particularly in the overly glowing descriptions of EDS employees.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Trevor (Christian Bale) took the wrong path in life and stayed there.  This movie artistically shows what happens mentally and physically when that decision is made.    Mentally, the world looks bleak.  The color scheme is mostly grey tones, with only clues showing up in vivid color.  Instead of paying attention to these bright clues, though, Trevor views them as a threat.  He drives himself crazy and drives others away who could help him.    Another artistic effect is the harsh lighting.  It mimics what it feels like when you're trying to sleep and someone blasts the curtains open.  Whenever Trevor tries to sleep, he's awakened by harsh lighting, which I interpreted as his conscience preventing him from ignoring the truth.    Physically, Trevor is deteriorating along with his mind.  Christian Bale lost a lot of weight for this role, to the point of his ribcage sticking out.  I admit I was a little worried about his health.    Some parts of the story confused me, but overall, I enjoyed how artistically this cautionary tale was told.
B000001GEM|5.0|Having been severely underwhelmed by the stodginess of Simon Rattle's much-vaunted Berlin recording of this great work, I turned with relief to this, the last of Karajan's versions. It is by no means afflicted by the \\"smoothification\\" which sometimes marked Karajan's later work: it is both grand and rugged, speeds not especially slow and invariably generating the requisite tension at such points when Brahms bursts out of the prevailing mood of melancholy and the music surges forward, as in the \\"Aber des Herrn Wort\\" and the great, consolatory C major fugue, so reminiscent of Bach. The Vienna forces are superb, galvanised by Karajan's sure direction, secure of intonation and startlingly unified. The soloists are equally inspired: José van Dam easily the finest bass-baritone I have ever heard in this part, noble of tone and subtle of expression; Barbara Hendricks' silvery voice soars angelically to rival Gundula Janowitz - which is high praise indeed. It is an \\"old-fashioned\\" account compared with Gardiner's friskiness but I think this Romantic, humanist grappling with grief and search for meaning in death needs more weight than Gardiner gives it and this 1983 recording remains my Brahms Requiem of choice.
B002MRROKS|4.0|This is a great DVD. Only 4 stars because I would have like more features and more camera angles. Set list is great  including \\"On A Plain\\" and \\"Stay Away.\\"     Dave on drums is amazing, especially impacting the Bleach songs. Nirvana fans should have this on the shelf. It reminds me of how much I dig this band and how great of a songwriter Kurt was.     I wish they would release MTV\\"s \\"Live and Loud\\" next.     Long live Nirvana.
0307716988|5.0|I love this book, it's truly a window into Michael Jackson's heart.  He was a magnificent human being - loving, kind, insightful, and both innocent and wise for his 29 years when this was written.  How we let such a treasure slip through our fingers, how we let a vicious worldwide media rip him apart, is incomprehensible.  It's an absolute crime.      Michael's life story, told in his own words, is sheer delight.  To see what shaped him into the astonishingly brilliant performer and talent he was for so many years is wonderful.  The stories about his family, his brothers, and the numerous people he interacted with throughout the years are enchanting.  His spiritual depth and loving heart sparkle on every single page.       It is truly heartbreaking to know he is gone forever. If you are a Michael Jackson fan, you cannot do with out this book.
B00514HDNW|2.0|I know this is a classic and I am supposed to love it.  But I did not like it the first time I read it, and I still think the 3 movies are better than the book.  At least they had some action and the plot moved well.  I f not consider this book to be a classic, or up to the standards of Azimov or Clarke.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I would have to say that seeing this movie is essential to the survival of   the world and especially, American citizens.  Don't just sit there, do something.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a must-have movie for every collection.  The Diamond Edition includes both a regular DVD as well as the blu-ray edition of the film.  This is something I greatly appreciate with four young children--the regular DVD can be used by them to watch over and over while the Blu-ray film remains pristine in our collection.     Snow White is one of my favorites of all Disney's films.  It is not only a classic movie, but one that has ingrained itself in American culture.  This particular release includes bonus features such as Disney's Family Play and Backstage Disney.  Children will enjoy the mini games while film or history buffs will love the behind-the-scenes information.    In classic fairy-tale tradition, Snow White must escape her evil step-mother--and--queen.  She runs away and encounters the seven dwarfs.  For a while, all is well--Snow White endears herself to the dwarfs and takes care of them in return for a place to stay.  The Queen discovers her hiding place and entices her to bite an apple that has been infused with an evil spell.  Snow White succumbs to the apple's poison.  All is not lost, however--the spell may be broken by true love's kiss!  When Snow White's soul mate arrives and kisses her, she awakens to live \\"happily ever after.\\"  While some may object to the helpless female character passively waiting to be rescued by her prince, the movie is still an enjoyable story and this could provide an excellent opportunity to discuss such issues in a wider context.    This is one movie that needs to be in everyone's movie collection.  The entire family will enjoy watching this--it is a timeless classic that has been visually enhanced for modern viewing.
B0015DROBO|5.0|story started out slow.  was not sure i wanted to co nti nue after the first 20 pages.  glad i did.  the characters were  very real and i could picture them in my minds eye.  before long i was totally immersed in the story. i have already bought the girl who played with fire.  plan to read it right away.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Even though many people say Skin and Bones should not be on this album, I think it serves its purpose. I've seen the Foo's 4 times now and the last time I saw them they absolutely ROCKED that song. It was probably one of the best performances they did that night. Hands down, great song. Obviously there were going to be songs that were missed because they have way too many great songs for one cd unless they made it a double.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Michael Buble's newest album \\"Crazy Love\\" is both relevant and reminiscent of a day that brought us the talent of Frank Sinatra and the like. Gentle crooning is beautifully contrasted with big band style accompaniment, complete with horn section.  Smooth, soulful remakes of \\"Georgia\\", \\"Crazy Love\\" and \\"You're nobody till Somebody Loves You\\" are dramatically contrasted  with lively versions of \\"Cry me a River\\" and \\"Baby (You've got what it takes).  Buble's mix of classic and contemporary, jazz and pop will appeal to both new and seasoned fans. \\"Crazy Love\\" will not disappoint.
B002M2T1UO|3.0|Many of the DVD's were scratched, and scratched badly upon opening. This is not an Amazon shipping problem, but a Sony packaging problem. It seems that the glue to hold the pages together dried on the inner sleeves, and when you pull them out (DVD's) the scratch on the hard glue. I am getting a replacement set, hopefully this was an original production run problem.
B002L9N4EM|1.0|The kitchy \\"chocolate box\\" packaging might seem cute, but the discs inside are the same from the 2001 release, with none of the new extras included on the Blu-ray discs. Plus, you'll be ticked when you realize that there is no conventional DVD case inside the box. This box won't fit on your shelves. Get the Signature Collection BD, or order the 2001 DVD if you don't own a BD player. The simple 16-page booklet inside isn't worth buying this one.
B000025XKM|5.0|This was Nick Drake's third and last completed album. It is also often thought of as his most personal. In the only interview he ever granted (for Sounds Magazine), one of the few revealing things he had to say was that he felt his second album BRYTER LAYTER had been \\"over-produced.\\" Although I don't necessarily agree (I love the album), it's understandable how a singer-songwriter as Drake may not have felt at home surrounded by orchestral arrangements. Drake's music demands a certain degree of focus in order to be fully appreciated, and he possibly felt that the arrangements on BRYTER LAYTER, though making his music more commercially accessible, disabled him from telling what he wanted to say the way he wanted to say it.<br /><br />PINK MOON appears to have been more or less a reaction to the arrangements of the previous album; sort of an this-is-how-I-want-to-be-heard act. It displays Nick alone with his guitar, only accompanied with a brief piano bit during the brilliant title track which also opens the album (\\"it's gonna get ye all...\\"). For some years, said title track was just about the single song on the album I listened to regularly; when I discovered Nick in my early teens I was more easily drawn to his more produced albums. However, as the years go by I turn increasingly attentive to the nuances within the other songs on PINK MOON, which are often too subtle to be grasped at first listening but all the more stunning once you do get them. Nothing is really polished here; it seems that we are meant to be reminded that it is a human being behind the songs. Every aspect, from the lyrics to the guitar-playing to the vocal, feels so unmasked, so honest that it sometimes, literally makes me shiver; Nick singing \\"Take a look you may see me on the ground / For I am a parasite of this town...\\" is only one instance. Also in the brief, instrumental \\"Horn,\\" which could be mistaken for being a mere \\"filler\\" if one doesn't pay sufficient attention, each sound coming from the seemingly repetitive guitar-picking provides a distinct personality. The playing on \\"Road\\" is literally hypnotizing; every time this song is running, there is no thing in the world I would rather do than just listen and listen.<br /><br />When PINK MOON was released in the winter of 1972, it is reported to have sold even less than its two predecessors. However, as Nick Drake finally began to gain wider recognition years after his death, the album has come to be regarded as perhaps his most arresting, timeless work. Whereas BRYTER LAYTER included some elements which were quite typical in British folk rock of the time, such as the use of flutes, there is little (if anything) to indicate that PINK MOON was born several decades ago. \\"And now we rise, and we are everywhere...\\" Beautiful.<br /><br />(Review was updated March, 2012)the seemingly repetitive guitar-picking provides a distinct personality.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I used to wait excited for his new books; this one however has changed that.  I will never purchase another perhaps rent from the library but I doubt it. Lost Symbol is BORING!
B0021L8UPS|3.0|Yep, the father in this film really has the blinders on.  He does not want to see what is right in front of him.  He takes the orphan's side over that of his wife and kids.  Also, there is a weird scene with him and Esther on the couch when he's been drinking wine but seems to be drugged.  And I find it hard to believe that the little sister would have the physical strength to help lug a body around, or even to knock Esther down.  Also, why didn't the orphanage know more info about where Esther came from in the first place? Big plot hole.<br /><br />However, there is a real, creepy factor at work in the film. Esther is just too advanced, too good to be true, highly manipulative, and well played by the young actor.  Nice locations too, and CCH Pounder is always good in just about any role she takes on.<br /><br />It's worth a rental, if not a purchase.
B0002ADY1K|5.0|It is such a pleasure to hear these great songs remastered. The bonus songs are very good too. I enjot \\"Demons and Wizards\\" more but still highly recommend this classic.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|It's a beautiful, timeless love story that is so well-written that it's breath-taking when the plot twists.  It's very difficult to NOT giveaway the twists in a story to a writer watching a film.  I was distracted enough by other details that the two big plot twists packed a major wallop.  It's theme of love, acceptance, personal growth, and all the things that are really important along with its wonderful, wonderful characters will stay with you forever.  I know nothing about animation.  Visually, it seemed stunning.  But while so many animated films rely on the visual alone, this is as complex and vibrant a story I've seen in a film in quite some time.  Oh, and it's hilarious.  Just expect the kids to be saying \\"Squirrel!\\" a lot.     I'm buying this for everyone I love for Christmas.
B0002ADY1A|5.0|I bought this CD upon reading the reviews here. The reviews that rated it highly are spot on. This CD is crisp, clean, vibrant and a spacial pleasure. Highly recommend!
B000R8YC1I|5.0|I never realised it took five years to make this movie. Puppets and scenes hand made not computer generated. Worth the money.
0743298039|5.0|I have a line up of books to be read, with this as the third one down the line.    Everyone tells me to hurry up and read it, that its great.    I'm still gasping over the story in Coronary, about some surgeons in Redding CA.    Excellent transaction through Amazon.com
B001GCUER0|5.0|I love this series and the second season was as good as the first and this is the best way to watch because there are no commercials.  I can't wait for the 3rd season to come out on DVD.
B0011Z5CV0|4.0|This is one of baby's favorite toys.  Nice music, colors, textures, and patterns.  Very interactive.     No five star rating for four reasons:    (1) Too few songs and too short segments of songs.  (2) Too short record time.  (3) Notes on trunk are quite difficult to press.  (4) Tricky to press the spot that must be pressed to initiate music.    These issues mean that someone other than baby must constantly press different parts of the elephant in lieu of baby for quite some time until baby learns to do it alone.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I loved every minute of this movie, and this extraodinary tribute convinced me even more that there won't be another artist like MJ...this would have been the unforgettable concert...I am really glad that the producers recorded these rehearsals...
0767020308|4.0|It's been years since I read the book so I can't comment on how close the film follows it.  I haven't seen the Gwynneth Paltrow Emma either so I can't compare these two films.      The production was first rate---costumes, settings, etc. as one would expect.  I thought the whole cast was excellent, too, with the exception of Kate Beckensall in the lead.  I don't know if the fault lay in the direction, the script or the actress, but her Emma comes across as so unpleasant that I really couldn't be very happy for the ending.  She is obviously privileged, pampered and very well treated by everyone, including the well-named Mr. Knightly, who cares enough for her to tell her off when it's necessary.  Her own father is adorable but sleeps a lot and obviously has never bothered to discipline his darling daughter.    Her sense of smug superiority  and out-and-out rudeness is so off-putting that I was really happy when the handsome blond guy she liked married the sweet and truly beautiful governess.  In reading other reviews, I gather that Paltrows's version of the character is much more sympathetic.  I think I'll check that out.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|Love it, enough said. If you watch the DVD that comes with the special edition, you will know that this is NOT just a Neal Morse solo album with guest musicians as some of the detractors have ststed. Everybody had their input. As far as Neal's lyrics go, yeah, you can tell he is Christian, so what? Every artist puts their own opinions and beliefs in their lyrics, unless you just want some generis radio dance fluff about shaking your booty. Listen to any of the great bands, you can tell they put their soul in the lyrics, whether others agree with them or not.
1579128149|5.0|Chock full of beautifully done photos, as well as sharp wit.  Just about every page has something silly somewhere.  For example:<br /><br />  \\"Sodium is the most explosive and the best tasting of all the alkali metals\\"<br />  \\"Disposable oxygen tanks for hobby brazing and as a refreshing pick-me-up...\\"<br />  \\"So many important chemicals have been discovered by accident that one has to wonder what a bunch of bumblers chemists are\\"<br />  \\"Bananas are high in potassium, thus both healthy and radioactive.\\"<br />  \\"This piece of the mineral thorite might contain an atom of francium, if you watch closely.\\"<br /><br />He's also quite informative.  For example, some of you may have taken exception to his comment on sodium, which he explains on the page about cesium:<br /><br />  \\"Cesium is widely listed as the most reactive of all the alkali metals, and technically it is.  When you drop a piece in a bowl of water it *instantly* explodes, sending water flying in all directions.  But that doesn't mean it makes the biggest bang of the alkali metals.  Sodium takes longer to explode when tossed into water but the whole time you're waiting, a plume of hydrogen gas is building up, and when all that hydrogen ignites, the explosion is much bigger than anything you can get with cesium\\"<br /><br />Sounds like some important research there!<br /><br />Or this fact that makes perfect sense, though I never really thought about it:<br /><br />  \\"Even lead will float on mercury\\"<br /><br />Overall just an excellent, easily readable, pretty, thought-provoking book.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I just seen a release date of 02/15/2010 on the Family Video website.  I am not a big fan of MJ but I thought this movie was great. I can imagine how huge his concert would of been. I reccomend purchasing this movie or go to see it if your a fan or not.
B002MRROKS|5.0|After owning a bootleg copy of this classic concert for years, they've finally decided to OFFICIALLY release it on dvd. The picture and sound are amazing for a show that is nearly 17 years old. I would recommend this set to any fan of Cobain and or Nirvana. There's no extra's at all, except for a short video of a young fan meeting Kurt after the show, its at the very end of all the credits. Like a prev. review said, I to hope they release MTV Live and Loud from 1993, I would also like to see hollywood rockfest released in the near future.
B001DHE9KG|5.0|In December of 1981, New York's Metropolitan Opera unveiled what would become its all time most popular offering--Franco Zeffirelli's production of Puccini's LA BOHEME. The original cast included thee of opera's best known performers: Teresa Stratas as Mimi, Jose Carreras as Rodolfo, and Renata Scotto, so often cast as Mimi was Musetta. Critics praised the cast but were mixed as far as reviews were concerned--some believed the production was \\"too big\\" while others praised Zeffirelli's designs from the simplicity of the loft in Act I and Act IV to the largess of Act II's Caf&eacute; Momus scene and the understated beauty of Act III. The public fell in love with the new LA BOHEME  immediately and twenty eight years later, it is still a magical experience of opera.<br />This DVD, originally a Live in HD broadcast of March 2008, allowed movie goers two great opportunities. Seeing the opera broadcast in a large screen made it almost like being at the Met. Viewers also got to see behind the scenes shots such as the scenery being assembled, which for this production of the opera was just as interesting as the opera itself. It also included a tribute to the director, interviews with the performers and conductor, and an enchanting interview with members of the children's' chorus. Only some of the scene changes are included in this DVD as well as a portion of eth Zeffirelli tribute. The interviews are not included, however what is included is the wonderful performance of that afternoon.<br /><br />As far as the cats is concerned, it was excellent for a live performance. Conductor Nicola Luisotti conducted the score with vigor. Tenor Ramon Vargas is the production's Rodolfo. His acting is good,  and he is at home in the role, though \\"Che gelida manina\\" is transposed down an octave which is not uncommon in live productions. Angela Ghorghiu as the young seamstress Mimi seems a bit if a stretch as the opera begins, but she is expressive and plays a woman dying from consumption with conviction. Ludovic Tezier and Ainhoa Arteta simply playing the tumultuous lovers of Marcello and Musetta. Paul Plishka performs the dual roles of Benoit and Alcindoro,  roles often performed by Met favorites later in their careers, a tradition that dates back to Italo Tajo in the original production. The entire cast works well together and seems to enjoy the performance.<br /><br />The DVD transfer is good though not as spacious as on the large screen which is to be expected, but it is still a worthwhile disc that contains the magic of this beloved opera.ovic Tezier and Ainhoa Arteta simply playing the tumultuous lovers of Marcello and Musetta.

0547258305|4.0|When she was very young Katsa's grace for killing became apparent when she was defending herself from her uncle. After that she was brought up as the King's killer, the one who was called upon to take care of problem subjects who failed to do what he liked. But Katsa was not happy with her charge and slowly she found a way to use her grace for more constructive purposes. While seeking to free a kidnapped old man from a neighboring kingdom Katsa happens upon another graceling, one who seems could be her match. What starts off as an unexpected encounter will eventually precipitate a change in Katsa's world that she never could have expected.    I really enjoyed the way the author took such a fresh perspective on the idea of people with supernatural powers and the way she built it into her society. I also liked the idea of the mismatched eyes. The story was very engaging and I liked all the characters you are supposed to like, especially Katsa, Po and Bitterblue, and was horrified at all the right places. I truly didn't foresee what would happen as the book went along and it was fun to sit back and be carried along with the adventure. This sort of reminded me of McKinely's \\"Hero and the Crown\\" although I rather enjoy Cashore's writing style a bit more. I can see where some of the themes may offend more sensitive people, particularly the violence and the intimacy without marriage theme, but I think it is all approached in a thoughtful and relatively non-graphic way with clear reasons given. Truly a very well written story with a strong female lead that I would not hesitate to recommend to young adults.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|My review is of the movie Star Trek and not the DVD. The casting for this movie was great with nearly every actor perfect for the character they were playing. The problem I had was with the story. Time travel is fine, going to an alternate universe is fine, but there were some things that just took me out of the movie.                                           SPOILER WARNING       First, after 30 plus years of Star Trek showing ships being built in space from Star Trek TMP on thru the other movies and TV shows JJ Abrams decides his new Enterprise will be built in a corn field.   Then we go to the destruction of Vulcan and Spock prime watching this from another planet which is far enough away that the Enterprise is traveling for 5 minutes in the movie before Kirk is dropped off on the planet Spock is on.   Then after all other Trek movies and TV shows explain that you have to be fairly close to a planet or ship to transport or \\"beam\\" someone to and from it, at the end of the movie you have the Enterprise \\"beam\\" Kirk and Spock halfway across the solar system from Saturn's moon Titan to Nero's ship orbiting Earth.   My biggest complaint is the changes to Kirk. In the real military, personnel work their way up the ranks from cadet or ensign thru different grades until they become a officer. In the original Star Trek Gene Roddenbery took the time and effort to create a back history for Kirk where he served on other ships before becoming Captain of the Enterprise. In this new movie Kirk goes from Cadet to Captain which is incredible and totally unbelievable.     I know Trek is fantasy and entertainment, but alot of people put a lot of time and effort into making these characters into \\"people\\" we could relate to and would like to spend time with.
B000005HLV|5.0|I actually owned all the Mayhem albums before I finally got this one as I usually  don't care much for overhyped albums. Well... I must say that it really isn't even close as to the best album from these guys.  This one is just amazing.  Must say it is actually rekindling my interest in Black Metal as a whole.  Just a great, great CD all the way through but I must admit that Freezing Moon is the best BM song I've ever heard.  Epic and cold.<br /><br />In the end, the vocals really just make the album IMO.  The drumming is superb as well and as a whole the album is just really impressive.<br /><br />Update: Aug 13 - It been years now since I first heard this CD and I must say it is probably in my top 5 favorite albums ever.  There is just some innate about it that I can't quite put my finger on.  Mayhem just sounds so cold, evil and nasty and they sound super raw here.  This is simply put a masterpiece.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I just saw this amazing movie yesterday and i was floored at how great it was!!  Even though it was rehearsal footage and not the actual performance, his youthful energy and charisma was so in your face!!  the dancers were also so crazy talented and everyone was so in synch. there is no doubt that the concerts would have been his best filmed concert!!  his love for us, his love for the orchestra, his love for the earth, his love for his dancers, and his love for his family are so obvious and gorgeous to see!! he was a wonderful human being and i was dancing in my chair in the theatre and boppin my head....there's just no way you can just sit there!! So, yes purchase the dvd because it is just so priceless and beautiful!!      i just want to add this....i am also a huge prince fan, and i've seen him live many times since 1990, but michael's performance surpasses that of prince because he doesn't have a diva attitude and didn't preach about god like prince did even in rehearsal!!  so there you go, michael was and still is the bomb!!
0385504225|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, and all the little-known historical information about buildings, people, etc.  but honestly, it's same old story.  Take the DaVinci code, change the setting to Washington, change a few names, and you've pretty much got the story.      Read it, it's interesting, but don't expect huge things from it.

0061245097|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy the second installment since she left Bones in the first. This book came out of nowhere and was finished in one day. I couldn't put it down, I think i was smiling the whole time. It was superb, sadly over before I knew it. I'm now working on the third installment of this series. This book was action packed with angry moms, family reunions, blasts from the past, action (flying, fighting, dodging bullets), and unexpected, unrelenting romance! Everything you possibly want in a paranormal suspense romance. Wonderfully written and presented!
B000YAA68W|5.0|I loved this movie. I identified with Marjane's story because I know what it feels to be displaced out of your home country and to live as a stranger from that on. Simply honest and complete. It has become one of my favorite movies of all time!
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I didn't think I would like this at all, it was most unexpected.<br />It had characters I remember from the cartoon from childhood. it had superb action fights and scenes. Lots of futuristic weapons and planes. Lots of great actors, it was action from beginning to end.

B00026WU82|3.0|Five stars... I can't see (neither understand) the reason why. I've given many oppotunities to this album (in this very moment I'm giving it one more), expecting each time to hear what is in it that makes a lot of people happy-yelling about it... For me it's got one good song followed by another boring one. The goods are WONDERFUL indeed, and the borings are crispy and extremely poor arranged... For me it's a long long way between this album and the almost perfect \\"Subterranean Homescik Blues\\" or the glorius \\"Bolde on Blonde\\". Anyway, there's no account for taste.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I went to see \\"Nemesis\\" once.  I went to see \\"Star Trek\\" 16 times.  Enough said!  I wasn't alone as I started recognizing others in the theater back for more as well.   I can't wait for the Blu-ray!!!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|*References to spoilers in book!*    It is difficult for me to give less than 5-stars for what I believe is a 6 out of 5 stars book. HBP, in my humble opinion, is one of the greatest of the Rowling series, as it gives a specific insight into the workings of the Dark Lord, and everything in Harry's life starts to make sense. I agree with previous reviewers that this is the darkest book yet, and I think that's one of the drawcards to reading this book. Dumbledore is Harry's protector, mentor, and in the end, the greatest sorcerer of all time; on the other hand, Snape's character is further developed and we are now finally forced to make the decision: is he, or isn't he??    -Good Things-  1) Jim Broadbent is an excellent selection for Slughorn, and his character is as jovial and unique as out of Rowling's novel.    2) I also believe this is the best performance by Michael Gambon as Dumbledore - he appeared too neurotic in the previous films, as Dumbledore is never supposed to be overly-nervous, as he always has an idea of what's going on. The scene in the cave is straight from the book, and we see Dumbledore exactly as Rowling had intended: a vulnerable person, just like everyone else. Plus, the setting was fantastic and very suspenseful.    3) Ron vs. Hermoine! Very enjoyable scenes between these two characters, adding extra humour to a very dark film.    4) Draco Malfoy's character is more prominent in this film, and viewers enjoy seeing a side of the younger Malfoy that perhaps is hinted in the previous films/books - overconfident on the outside, but different on the inside. This scene also shows a side of Harry's character that will further show in the final film.    -Bad Things-  1) For goodness sakes, WHY do they see it as their prerogative to change CRUCIAL sections of the book?? And then add other useless junk?? The waitress - completely unnecessary scene, as we get many glimpses of Harry's developing maturity in other scenes. It made no sense to add it. The fire at the Burrow - this is just plain ridiculous. The Burrow is the place of Harry's salvation, where the Order meet on countless occasions, etc. etc. I don't understand why they chose to burn the place up - where do they propose Ron's family live for the Dealthly Hallows dialogue??!    2) One thing I am really disappointed was removed from the films was the story of Neville's parents. They were NOT killed by Bellatrix Lestrange (as the previous film hinted) - and there was a key scene in this film that gives the background to Neville's determination to prove himself in the final book. Mr. Weasley's attack was removed completely. Moreover, there was what would have been a very funny revival of a glimpse of Lockhart connected with these events - I for one like these references back to earlier books, and am not happy with this exclusion.    3) They also seem to have removed the older Weasley boys from the movies, and this is not acceptible, as Bill, Fleur, and Charley play a key role in battle against the Dark Lord, and Bill's attack by the warewolf gives further credit to their parts to play. The upcoming wedding also sets the scene for the Deathly Hallows and I am sadly thinking perhaps this will be completely removed from the next film.    4) The pensieve scenes, including very interesting flashbacks, were also omitted. They were what makes the Dark Lord's story make sense, and the key flaw in his character. I think more time should have been invested into this story of Tom Riddle, rather than scenes that were not even in the book, and were silly to add.    5) Also, one word: SNAPE! WHY do they cut his role??! Alan Rickman is fantastic, and enjoyable to watch as Snape. They should retain his role, and stop putting his scenes on the cutting room floor.    So, why 4 stars?? Well, it is overall a good enough film, and it is enjoyable to watch. I am nit-picky as someone who has read the books several times, and has really enjoyed the intrigute story behind Harry Potter and Tom Riddle, so perhaps get a bit over-excited about scenes that are not specifically important. It is still a great film to watch, and it will certainly be interesting to see if they retain all the key parts of the final novel - since they're filming the final book in two films, let's hope they're doing this in order to keep all the important content and not simply for revenue raising.
B000066C1N|4.0|You can't go wrong with Bryan Adams. There are some really great songs, instrumental and vocal.
B0021L8UXU|5.0|I thought nothing of this movie when I heard about it, but I'm a HUGE Emma Stone fan and Jesse Eisenberg has recently won me over with Adventureland so I gave it a shot. I have to say I had the best time at the theater. More fun than I've had in years. I went alone but the whole theater was in it together... Laughing, ooohing, etc. It was great. Go see it, buy it... It's super fun.

B001993Y2C|3.0|Luckily I caught the series on sale much cheaper than the Amazon price. I would not have paid the higher price knowing I would have to repackage the set into proper DVD cases and throw away the junk packaging. It was easy to search out the BD contents on the web and piece together my own booklet containing the contents of each disc. It just took a bit of time.    The gritty grain however is just plain annoying. Very dissapointing to \\"dumb down\\" my HDTV settings so the grain isn't overwhelming. Many scenes I was looking forward to viewing in spectactular HD were so grainy and pixelated that it detracted from the viewing experience. Ron Moore in his comments actually states that he didn't get the chance to watch much of the HD version and his statement about how now we get to watch the show as it was actually meant to be seen doesn't sound convincing.    On a positive note the space battles were some of the best I've ever seen in Sci-fi tv unlike many shows and movies that cram so much action and confusion into the scenes that you can't figure out what is going on.

B00005JPD0|4.0|The story:  The story is interesting and compelling. It is hard when it needs to be and soft and touching when it should be. It touches many emotions. The plot grabs your imagination and keeps you interested. You do need to give in to the plot concepts to enjoy it the most.    The direction:  What I like most is the way your viewing time and attention is never wasted. The director skips over unnecessary stuff and keeps the story and action moving along. There is not a lot of filler conversation unlike many other movies.    The acting:  The acting is excellent. Denzel is Denzel yet, somehow different. He has a more 'humane' nature in this movie. He is more humble and polite in ways that don't diminish his strength and inner character. I found him to be very believable.    Summary: I liked this movie immensely. Its now part of my collection and I'll watch it again in the future...or is it the past?

Knowing the enemy (recognizing psychological barriers) is a valuable tool.<br /><br />That the author was able to communicate effectively in a succinct, 160 pages is ... well, bless you, Steven Pressfield! As an overworked editor I enjoy Pressfiend's lean, powerful writing, analogies, personal anechdotes, etc. He's a highly-effective communicator.

I have to admit that I don't care for a couple of the songs: \\"Start the Simulator\\" irks me and \\"Riding the Crest\\" is a bit repetitive (though parts of it get stuck in my head).  However, there are amazing songs on here.  \\"The Bandstand\\" is outstanding - the music caught me in the first seconds.  \\"What There Is\\" touches me deep inside.  \\"Foot of the Mountain\\" is delightful.  \\"Shadowside\\" makes me a little sad but in a good way.

There are all manner of songs.  \\"Crawl\\" (my current favorite) and \\"Hopeless\\" both have chorus words sort of screamed with a guttural intensity.  \\"Anthem of the Angels\\" is a sorrowful and slower song.  The release \\"I Will Not Bow\\" encourages you to live your life.  Every song on here is good, not repetitive, and with well-written lyrics.

B000MQC9H4|2.0|It's almost Christmas, and I am one of those people who gets into the mood early.  So when I found this one, starring Kate Winslet (whom I adore), I thought, can't go wrong, right?<br />Wrong.<br />Iris Sempkins (Kate Winslet) of Surrey has been pining after Jasper for three years.  Her life goes into an uproar when he suddenly reveals he is engaged.  Meanwhile, in LA, Amanda (Cameron Diaz) breaks up with her boyfriend (Edward Burns) when she finds out he was cheating with his receptionist.  On a whim, she decides to house exchange with Iris over the Christmas holiday.  While on Holiday, Amanda meets Graham, Iris' hot older brother (Jude Law).  In LA, Iris meets Miles, Amanda's ex-boyfriend's friend (Jack Black).  And the rest, as you might say, is history.<br />Kate Winslet and Jack Black's sidestory is absolutely adorable.  It is muted, it is subtle, it is cute, it is everything you would want in a romantic comedy.  They had real chemistry together, and I was definitely rooting for them to get together in the end.<br />I also adored the story with Iris and the screenwriter.  Very sweet and makes you realize that relationships are more than just between lovers, family members, you get the picture.<br />And, I know it's petty, but I loved the Dustin Hoffman cameo.  Funny!<br />But the majority of the story centers around the \\"love\\" (AKA \\"lust\\") between Amanda and Graham.  First off, while I liked Amanda's beginning (how she kicked out her boyfriend), I thought her story increasingly became boring and stupid, particularly right around Graham's \\"drunken\\" entrance.  I really hated Hollywood's \\"Well, you're drunk, I don't know you, so I think we should have sex\\" mentality.  WTF?  Who does this sort of irresponsible thing?  Maybe a teenager, maybe a college student, but a successful movie producer?  And a widower?!  With two young daughters?  Doesn't at least Graham realize that love doesn't abound from a one night stand with a drunk stranger?  I don't see how Hollywood thinks they can pull this horrible coupling off without making the rest of the world raise their eyebrows in skepticism.<br />Not to mention, Jude Law and Cameron Diaz have no chemistry with each other.  It's all physical.  Jude Law is a hunk; Cameron Diaz sexy.  There is nothing else between the two of them, and yet most of the movie centers on them and their falling in lust.  Boring!<br />In fact, the movie bored me so much (well, at least the parts that Kate Winslet and Jack Black weren't in) that I brought out my computer to surf the net at the same time.  I almost never do that.<br />My advice?  If you like Kate Winslet and Jack Black, I would watch their scenes and skip over everything else.  You'll thank me for it in the end.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*s horrible coupling off without making the rest of the world raise their eyebrows in skepticism.

B002MW50KO|1.0|What can say.  I love Bob Dylan and I love Christmas albums.  Having said that this album is for \\"Dylan completists\\" only.  Bob's strained and gargling voice is the main downside on \\"Christmas In The Heart\\".  His vocal styling may have worked on \\"Modern Times\\" and \\"Love and Theft\\" but here it is virtually unlistenable, bordering on laughable.  The only songs that are listenable are \\"Must Be Santa\\" with its Los Lobos style arrangement and energy and \\"The Christmas Song\\" which benefits from his world-weary voice.  Kudos to Bob and Sony Music for donating the proceeds to \\"Feed The Children\\" but overall, unless you need to complete your Dylan or Christmas album collection, give the money straight to your favorite charity instead.
1596061669|4.0|'The Shadow of the Wind' is a wonderful tale of Daniel Sempre, a young boy in post war Barcelona. The boy has recently lost his mother and is having a difficult time coping with the lose. Daniel's father is a book seller and finds it hard to relate to Daniel. After a bad night, Daniel is taken by his father to the Cemetary of Forgotten Books. Daniel is told to find a book that he will be responsible for taking care of.<br /><br />Daniel finds a book which he reads and loves. When Daniel tries to find more work by the author, he discovers that there is a mysterious poerson who has been tracking down all of the works of this author and burning them. Is his book the last one? Why are the books being burned? Where has the author disappeared to?<br /><br />The story takes us in and around post war Barcelona during the reign of Franco. Daniel delves ever deeper into the mystery and it does not just involve the missing author. The mystery begins to extend around Daniel, a friend's family (who's daughter he begins to fall in love with), and the missing authro's story.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was pleasantly surprised. I stop short of saying it tops Dickens and the other authors Zafon is compared to.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I never paid attention to this season when it first aired, but decided to check out the DVD. I watched the entire season in one weekend. Wow. I am blown away. This show takes quality TV to a new level. When I think of TV masterpieces, I think of Mad Men, Breaking Bad and Dexter. SOA brings a whole new intensity those shows do not have.    The acting is superb. These characters are gritty and unevolved on so many levels, yet they are very complicated and have depth.    It's funny how, as viewers, we're always given a character to connect to and feel for no matter how immoral they are. With SOA, there isn't one character I am cheering for yet I still watch. Yes, Jax does have a softer side and does have a glimpse of a conscience, but at the end of the day, he still runs on primal instinct.    I heard the second season is incredible. Let's hope it's renewed for a third.

0385504225|2.0|[...]<br /><br />First and foremost, here's the answer to the question everyone seems to want to know:  No, The Lost Symbol is not as good as The Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />Now, down to business: In the interest of full disclosure, I was predisposed not to like this book, because Dan Brown's writing irritates me. Still, I tried to give the book as much of a chance as possible. I know The Lost Symbol isn't War and Peace, so I tried it enjoy it for what it is: A best-selling thriller.<br /><br />I did my best. I really did. I suspended disbelief. I ignored the obvious plot holes...the Architect of the Capitol doesn't have a key to the front door? I looked past the annoying italics peppered throughout EVERY page, which are supposed to reveal characters' dramatic inner thoughts, but really just jar you out of the narrative. I even ignored the false-drama cliffhangers at the end of each chapter. (But when a dumb cliffhanger and an italicized thought were combined, I couldn't help but laugh out loud -- eg. Katherine's destiny is to light this torch. Mine is to destroy it.) I really tried to enjoy it. I promise.<br /><br />If you can get past all those faults, I suppose the story itself isn't terrible. Now-famous symbologist Robert Langdon speeds around Washington, D.C., deciphering encoded message after encoded message, hoping to save his friend Peter and stop a madman from revealing the Ancient Mysteries kept secret by the Masons for centuries. All the while, Langdon (and Brown) are constantly inserting little-known facts about various D.C. landmarks, as well as history, philosophy and religion. For instance, do you know the meaning of The Apotheosis of Washington (pictured above -- click on the image for a larger view), which is painted on the ceiling of the US Capitol dome? That explanation is at the heart of Brown's point for the novel, so I won't spoil it here. But even with all of Brown's historical hmmmms, it still didn't feel like The Lost Symbol delivered the same level of drama and intrigue as The Da Vinci Code. Maybe that's because I was more prepared to be skeptical this time, and I kept asking myself, \\"Is that really true?\\"<br /><br />And that was the biggest problem for me -- I never trusted Brown to lead me through the story to a satisfying payoff. Trust is such an enormous part of the unwritten reader-writer contract -- trust that you are in safe hands and the set-up and rising action will ultimately lead to a denouement that makes the time spent getting there worthwhile. Because of the clunky plotting and cliched writing, I expected to be let down at the end, so I never fully invested myself in the story. And so there was never a moment when I put down the book and thought, \\"Wow, I'm really enjoying this novel.\\"<br /><br />That said, I have to admit, there IS a payoff at the end. A cool twist, as well as a fairly interesting lesson in philosophy make the last 100 pages or so pretty enjoyable. But I didn't even realize I was enjoying them until the book was over and I was once again rolling my eyes at the cheesy last line.s The Da Vinci Code.

0316044938|4.0|The Lovely Bones starts out like an emotional freight train, then mellows as it progresses, and ends on a relatively nice note.  As a parent of young kids, I had a hard time with the first few chapters; Not because of their graphic nature, but rather being forced to imagine what it would be like to lose a child.  In fact, this whole book is difficult from that perspective.  There is a certain beauty and melancholy as the survivors slowly accept their loss and move on with their lives; and it is nicely balanced with the place in their hearts this young murdered girl will always hold.<br /><br />There are a number of reviews that are critical of how Susie's mother handled her death, or how unrealistic several elements of the story are.  Reading between the lines, those reviewers seemed more upset the story didn't go the way they wanted it to.  This is a book that you need to just go with; and when you do, you become immersed in the characters.  Some have commented that Susie's intimate experience late in the novel felt forced or out of context.  You have to be kidding; The author spent the better part of the book setting it up.  I saw it coming a mile away.<br /><br />I would have liked a stronger revenge angle, but only because I despised the murderer and wanted to see him suffer; but it really wouldn't have fit in the context of the plot development.<br /><br />In summary, The Lovely Bones is a very engaging book.  No, it is not one of the great literary works of all time, but in an age of throw-away paperbacks you can't remember a week later, this book has some staying power.

His sound is his own, but definitely reminds me of Sinatra. The quality of his voice is outstanding and my favorites are Georgia on My Mind and Crazy Love. This is something young and old will enjoy. The younger generation has discovered him and the older generation will be reminded of days gone by.  Great album, worth the $$$.\\"

0385504225|2.0|I was one of the legions of fans who absolutely loved Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code. In fact, I recall staying up all night to finish the latter, and being nearly comatose the next day during a conference I was attending. I was very eager to read The Lost Symbol, because I liked Dan Brown's detail and research. This book though - I don't have much good to say about it.     The pros - Once again, Dan Brown's detail to research is fascinating. He obviously researched the Freemasons, and took a lot of what he learned and turned it into a story. Well, sort of. I actually like his writing style, too, although some people do criticize it. His books read in some areas like a textbook, which is the part that I rather like when the topic interests me. I can see it being a bit dry for the action aficionados. He brought back a character that I like as well - RObert Langdon doesn't come off as some muscle-bound clod, but this intellectual-but-can-kick-butt-when-necessary.I do have more to say on this subject, however, later.     The cons - The villain is really, really bad. He is a caricature lifted out of some cheap straight to DVD slasher flick. He reminded me of Jason from Friday the 13th. Sorry, you can't cover a tattoo- especially whole body ones -without A LOT of makeup, and that would be so obvious that the only way you could pull it off would be to masquerade as a cross dresser. The other characters were BORING. Peter Solomon and his sister or whatever their names were (see - they made such a little impression that I cannot recall a thing) not very well-fleshed out, and once again, just seemed like caricatures. ANd Robert Langdon, despite my fondness for the charcter, also bored me. ANd that Japanese woman was ridiculous - made me think of those terrible stereotypical cartoons from WWII days. Boring. The whole plot was just confusing and silly, the editing wasn't very good, though I have to admit that at times I did get distracted by the less than ideal formatting in the Kindle edition. I skipped through whole sections of the book and I don't think that I missed very much. I can't even remember the end, but I know that it didn't come fast enough.     Sounds pretty bad. It is not a good book. SOme people may enjoy it. I did not. I would advise borrowing it from a library or some unlucky person like me who actually pre-ordered it.

B001O8D47S|3.0|Diane English picked up and rearranged the missing pieces of the romantic comedy genre, based on the multidimensional affective feminine universe. But smartly she focuses her whole attention around seven well defined characters; the first three are of course Meg Ryan as the devoted wife always trying to shine as human being. But living into a happy bubble (living in a beautiful home at Connecticut, married with a successful executive and supported by her best friend (Annette Bening) - the second main character - she will have to have to face the world when she hits the bottom at the moment she realizes her husband cheats her with the alluring Eva Mendes. The third main character is her mother (the lovable and still beautiful Candice Bergen) who will support her according her particular style, and finally we have Ryan's daughter a girl who's living the hard transition of the adolescence (with its doubts and fears)  . But the other three secondary roles turn around Eva Mendes the seductive lover of Stephen Haines, (who looks fine in this role); the pregnant friend (who expects this birth with hope and illusion) and the lesbian character (who lives with a super model).<br /><br />New York is the big stage, the fashion world and its well known dissonances rounds an entire and passable film with a happy ending when the different destinies of these women intersect themselves.<br /><br />Curiously there's no single shot with a masculine character all the way through. We just listen far references (as the telephone call with Ryan's husband).<br /><br />A very well written script makes of this movie a pleasant and enriching experience for making us think.<br /><br />But the raw material was by far much more promising that the final outcome.

B002GSXKN8|3.0|Quite frankly it pains me to see these 4-movie packs knowing how much I've spent over the years first collecting the movies on VHS, then on DVD and then finally on digitally remastered DVD and now I'm moving onto Blue Ray.  I know call me a sucker but the first two Batmans are in my top ten list.  So what are you gonna do.  But for you who are new to the series or revisiting the series, its an excellent value.  Just word of caution reading from other users review this sounds like your getting the old unmastered transfer of the film as well as the crap extras that came with it and not the newer digitally remastered version, that are beautiful to behold and come with the best dvd extras.  So if you value savings over clarity and perks this collection is perfect...if not seek the Special Editions.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|No reason to belabor these comments - if you enjoyed the Connery/Bond movies, you will find this to be a deeply and excruciatingly painful degradation of the Ian Fleming novels.  I will not watch or purchase another Bond movie with Craig in the lead role - for my money, he is almost the perfect \\"anti-Bond\\" - no culture, no sophistication, a deadly dull \\"tough guy\\" and totally politically correct - what a bore!!!
0061719544|5.0|This book provides entertaining and touching insight into the life experiences that created the public face of Craig Ferguson, from his ordinary origins in Scotland to the unexpected public character we know today. Craig makes no attempt to hide the immature - and sometimes questionable - decisions of his past, but presents them as an accepted part of who he is.  We also see, however, how his responses and willingness to explore new things (which likely explained his alcohol and drug experimentation pattern) allowed him to explore and embrace a new country, and a new life that was quite different from his family and native land. Craig is unashamed of his pride in his American identity and his devotion to the country that he chose.  I'm sure his story and emotions reflect the journey of many immigrants to the US who have left a home country to be adopted into a new.    This book is a beautifully balanced and honest look at life - joy, humour, darkness and desperation - combined into an engaging read.  I highly recommend it.

At first, I wasn't sure if I even wanted to read it since I thought the subject matter would be too disturbing, but it is written in such a way that it is not as brutal and disturbing as it COULD be.  The murder scenes are not too graphic, and I was pleased to know right from the beginning that cannibalism is not allowed in the games...WHEW! (because honestly, the title made me think otherwise). I was pleasantly surprised and am anxiously awaiting the call from the library to tell me that Book 2 has arrived.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|When I heard this documentary was out, I was itching to see it and then I got delayed. I started getting worried but I checked the theater and they still had it running once a day. HURRAY I wouldn't miss it and was going that day. THE GUITAR GENIUSES WERE PLAYING & I WAS SEEING THEM! And let me tell you, it was everything I expected and MORE!    I am a longtime U2 fan and WHO ISN'T a Led Zeppelin fan??  Jack White is kind of new to me, but the film is going for past, present and future generations of rock guitar expertise and that is exactly what is achieved. As another reviewer expressed, it is quite a thing to see the faces of Edge & White marveling at what Page is talking about, playing etc. He IS the GOD up there in the trio, who can make the guitar do things no one else I've ever heard yet do since Page has run his fingers across guitar strings.  NO ONE.  There are many, many truly talented guitar players out there who I would include in a list WITH Page, but Page set the bar HIGH ENOUGH for all these other players to try and reach for; he made them want to be THAT GOOD. And a small handful ARE that good.  BECAUSE of Page.    Now I've heard people diss Edge, saying he wasn't much a guitar player etc.  Well, I'm a HUGE HUGE U2 fan and so I ALREADY know what Edge can do and how he does it. He creates multiple guitar parts for one song; he hears it all in his head, uses several guitars in one song, and blends all the parts together to combine an AMAZINGLY masterful blend of guitar parts to express himself in JUST ONE SONG!  He, like a symphony writer, hears all the parts of what he wants to write and with his guitars and MASSIVE pedal board, creates magnificent sounds that are TRULY UNIQUE and unmatchable by anyone else in rock today.  AND ONE MORE THING: Edge CAN DO A ROCKIN' MAD GUITAR SOLO ANYTIME HE WANTS TO.......his skills are mad crazy.    Jack White - that opening sequence of him making that scant guitar is something else........truly poetic and his scenesare proof of what is yet to come and of how much he has already done.  I wasn't as familiar with his work as I was with the other but I knew who the White Stripes were and WOW are they great.  Dude is most righteously talented and for a young man, has a keen interest and understanding of the blues. That usually takes years to possess/acquire. But he already has it.  He has proven he can spread his talent across many different bands, but I think it would befit him to settle down and suit up with one and let it rock.  He did look truly awe-inspired in watching Page & Edge (not just patronizing - he seemed genuine) and looked to be soaking it all up. These guys have made it to the BIG SHOW!!  And I am sure that is where Jack would surely like to be at some point.  He has time to experiment now; but to be a master, you have to get your sound and rock it out like there's no tomorrow.  I am sure he will.    Like the others, I did not want this to end.  Seeing them all play together was LIKE A DREAM. And do it on slide......oh wow, what a moment.  Hearing Edge tell them all, \\"no it's a B Minor\\" (again to all the Edge nay-sayers, the dude knows music) as they are jamming together, I mean, this is a \\"never going to happen again\\" moment and it was a \\"goose bump\\" moment watching as they all sit together with instruments in hand, taking turns or playing together, eyes riveted on one another.  I can tell they all had fun making this - there was JOY in there eyes and in their music. There was JOY IN ME.    If you love these guys, if you love guitars, if you love rock music - GET THIS!!!

0316017922|5.0|This is a wonderful book.<br /><br />I very much like Gladwell's writing style. Whatever he says, I feel like he's being reasonable and thoughtful. He is the opposite of someone like N. N. Taleb, the acerbic author of The Black Swan. Taleb advises humility by being haughty and condescending while Gladwell does so with introspection and humility himself. There is another similarity between these two authors where one did it wrong and the other got it right. Taleb used bizarre fictional scenarios to try to make his points with a flowery \\"literary\\" feel. In this book, Gladwell masterfully describes real situations in interesting, yet not overly dramatic ways to do the same. (It's hard to seem overly dramatic when commenting on the actual cockpit recordings of a plane destined to crash.)<br /><br />This book was a pretty comfortable mix of information and presentation. He used real stories to try and paint a picture that went beyond just the statistical facts. He managed to do this without going into rambling editorials since he did have plenty of fascinating research findings to keep things accurate. At the end he did go into a vague territory that would seem unsubstantiatable by the record available to the public, however, since he was talking about his own family's personal stories, it was quite credible and interesting, and it gave his premise a personal aspect.<br /><br />The main point of this book is, in my opinion, very important. It's also complicated. The nature of \\"success\\" is incredibly oversimplified in our normal existence, but Gladwell shows pretty well how that might be a big mistake. If having a lot of smart talented people doing clever, useful things is good, then surely as a society we'd jump at the chance to double that kind of productivity. I think there is a natural gravitation towards meritocracy, but it is much slower than it needs to be for our introspective species. This book shows why and how we might start to rethink how we plan for success. There is absolutely no moralizing in here, but the thoughtful reader will draw their own conclusions about all kinds of topics. It should put one's successes and failures in context. After reading this I was actually more hopeful that humans can work together to maximize success for us all.oralizing in here, but the thoughtful reader will draw their own conclusions about all kinds of topics.

B002NXSRX4|5.0|When this movie was released on video this past Tuesday, I walked right past it at my local video store.  Then I came down with the flu and had my misses run out and pick me up a few movies that she might think I'd enjoy.  This was one of them.  I figured I'd just fall asleep to it and then tear it apart in a review.  I turn it on and watch the first scene before I turn over and go to sleep.  I didn't turn over to go to sleep until the movie was over.  It just grabbed me from the start.  The weapons weren't too unrealistic (given it's in the future) and the action was on the same level of a Transformers movie.  Needless to say, I returned the video to my store and then proceeded to buy it on Blu Ray where it's even better because crystal clear high definition plus high octane action equals everything I could ever want from a movie.  GI Joe's are for guys and Barbie's are for girls..  This is absolutely a guy movie.  Not to say women won't love it, but men will just a little more.  (My fiancee watched it with me and was bored).  The action never stopped so I don't know how you could get bored with this.

B002I6251G|4.0|I was a big fan of the first two Editors CDs.  A guitar sound reminiscent of the Chameleons UK (an 80s favorite of mine).  Saw them twice as well....once at the 9:30 Club in DC and the Electric Factory in Philly.  This is a very different sound that is heavy on rhythmic synthesizers.  I really enjoy this CD, although it is a very different sound for them.

I'm so glad to have seen this film because it is a vigorous reminder of just what a great entertainer he was, how talented, how detail oriented and determined to deliver eye-popping performances. It's really well done. I'm glad I'll be able to remember him this way.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was my first of Dawkins' books and I am now planning to read the rest.  As he says, I don't think there's any possible way that a reasonable person could come out of reading this book with any doubts that evolution is real.  I found the book fascinating from beginning to end, well written, and pretty easy for a non-scientist to understand.    My one minor gripe is with the Kindle edition--I wish that the photographs from the book had been included.  Even though I know they would have lost something not being in color, it would have been really nice to see them--and as a result of leaving the color pages out, the footnotes that refer to those pages were rendered useless because rather than linking to, say, \\"color page 4\\", they simply linked to page 4.  Still, all in all, a great Kindle translation, and most of the black and white drawings/images were rendered very well on the Kindle.

B00005YUFK|5.0|As a long-time fan of Hugh Masekela, I have heard just about everything he has recorded. So keen is my attraction to his sound, that I can recognize a Hugh flugelhorn solo within 2 bars by his signature licks and playfulness. Of course, there have been albums that were not up to par for my spoilt ears, but I dismiss that with the acceptance that he is only human and entitled to moments of mediocrity, just surviving with his art....    Just as I had began to get the feeling that the old lungs were not powerful enough, the chops not as practised, and the gravelly voice tired, Hugh brought out Hope.     It was a stunning surprise!! It is arguably the best ever live recording from Hugh. It ought to be required reference material for any budding audio engineer seeking to capture a concert perfectly.  The dynamics are spot-on, from rumbling drum rolls to gunshot snares, as Hugh intersperses vocal play with horn solos accompanied by a very tight combo (Baghiti Kumalo on bass!). The playfulness is still there, in particular as Hugh plays the naughty old man in the \\"Marketplace\\", to the delight of what must have been an audience of insiders.    If you do not know Hugh Masekela, buy this CD. If you know him, do not leave it out of your collection. It spans tunes from the 60's days to the early 90's, performed in a timeless way (i.e. without sythesizers, drum machines and other studio clutter). The material also covers his topical range very well. Too bad I cannot give more than 5 stars. I might be forced to give 3 and 4 to other perfectly deserving work!
B001FB55HQ|4.0|I agree with previous posts! I am so tired of them trying to shove Blue Ray down everyone's throats by forcing them to purchase BR instead of DVDs because they are not putting extras, or alternate versions, or even second discs with the DVD versions anymore. I don't own a Blue Ray player and I'm not buying one just so I can watch extras (however the extras are half the reason I buy a movie a lot of times). I'll keep buying regular old DVD's if they have the FULL PACKAGE or I won't buy any at all and wait until they release it with all the extras. It's crap.<br /><br />I'm in the entertainment industry and I want to see the storyboards, the preproduction, the special effects, hear the commentary, etc. Every time a new wave of movies are released there's less and less on the DVD and they're putting it on TWO blue ray discs (which defeats the purpose of blue ray anyway - it's supposed to hold more and they're putting the same mount of content on 2 blue rays as they did on 2 DVDs). They're just trying to get as much money out of people as they can. It's CRAP.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this movie, but am not happy about the DVD vs. Blue Ray release. Might as well stop making DVD's altogether if you want us to buy Blue Ray so badly.

0743297334|2.0|I'm hardly a literature major. I read for fun, and when I don't read for fun, I read to broaden my horizons. Having never read a Hemingway book in my life and wanting to step out of the comfort zone inhabited by Koontz, Rowling, Brown, Palahniuk and other modern authors, I picked this book up, expecting something grand after reading countless praise.    Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe I don't have an eye for clever literature (okay, I definitely don't have one). Whatever the case, this book struck me as unbearably boring.    I'm not some child who reviews books he never finished. I read the entire thing. I'm also not some uncultured college kid whose idea of a \\"classic\\" is Twilight and Stephen King; I've read and enjoyed books ranging from The Metamorphosis to Catch-22. But I could not enjoy this book at all.     Aside from a trip to see some bullfights, nothing happens in this book. People talk, get drunk, go to bed, wake up, talk some more. There's no story behind it. The narrator, Jake Barnes, is afflicted by a strange wound that apparently leaves him incapable of entering a relationship however, this wound is only mentioned in a passing glance and never revealed, expounded upon or even brought up ever again. The characters are either jerks or cardboard. There's no conflict and no resolution. It's like if Seinfeld were a book.    After trying to find out what all the fuss is about over this book, I found that there are some symbolic parallels between Lady Ashley (the central figure of the book, apparently) and other people or actions in the book (the bull fighting, for example). In addition, this book does seem to give justice to the generation of the time, which is cool for history buffs. So it is a more clever book than it appears on the surface.    I won't say this book isn't good. For all I know, it probably deserves its title as a classic. But what I will say is that I found The Sun Also Rises to be extremely boring and did not enjoy a moment of it. I'm very glad it was a short read.
B000A2WNB2|4.0|This DVD set is a good addition to any Muse fan's collection. That said, this isn't as well done as the concert on the HAARP set. However, it is interesting to compare the two and see what great leaps Muse has made in terms of fan base, style, presentation, and all-around pinache.<br /><br />The direction of the concert is good, but not great. It's quick cuts and fast paced \\"action sequences\\" try to keep in the spirit of the music, but would probably be better suited to a hardcore metal band like Slipknot. The extreme close-ups are something you will love or hate. How close to Bellamy's nostrils do you want to get? That is up to you as a fan.<br /><br />One note of caution in buying this dvd here: it is listed as all-region and it is actually Region 9. Therefore, Americans may not be able to watch it on their standard dvd player. It will play in DVD-ROM drives for computers and if you happen to have an all-region dvd player (which are not easily found).
B000ZELISO|5.0|I've been a huge fan of the book series and have loved all the movies thus far. This latest installment is clearly the best: improved acting from the young stars, plenty of humor, romance, and thrills. If you've enjoyed the previous films than this is a MUST! Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I have ADD and being able to watch a DVD all the way through, without being distracted, is my measure of its quality (visual, plot, acting, effects, etc. etc.). I am also an audiophile and very picky when it comes to quality in most everything I purchase. I recently bought my first Blu-ray player (LG) and this was my selection for my first Blu-ray DVD. I was going mainly from the huge number of positive reviews that had been registered. Incredible! I sat down with the intention of just watching a short portion until I had more time. I was immediately transported into a very unexpected escape... completely drawn into the screen. I watched the whole series that same day. I have since watched it again with friends. Simply fantastic. The camera work is unbelievable. The sound is worthy of the video quality. The production is off the charts. One of the best DVDs I have ever watched. Truly one to own. Also a great demo DVD for your home theater or your new HD screen.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|I am about half way through this season so far, having just bought it. I was curious as to how this series was, since I never heard anything about it other than they had made one. It was on sale so I purchased it...<br /><br />Boy, am I glad I bought it! It is a load of fun and action and the drama's pretty good too! The actors and actresses all fit their roles well (while she is a good actress, the Lena Headey playing Sarah Connor is too skinny - Sarah, especially in the 2nd movie was way buff because she was preparing for war - this lady just looks like all the other way too skinny hollywood women trying to look tough. I find it really hard to believe that being so thin she could be as physically strong as she is portrayed to be, but eh, that's Hollywood/America these days). Oh, and like someone else mentioned in their review: some of the filming quality/cuts were very shaky/jumpy and abrupt which is distracting but not so bad that it ruins the show. Hopefully they fix this problem in the second season.<br /><br />I AM disappointed the season is so short - but they have done such a good job on it. I am just hoping the second season will be as good. If you like sci-fi and the Terminator movies you should definitely enjoy this. It is a blast! It expands on the Terminator world too, which I always enjoy - things they don't go into detail on in the movies they can explore here. Definitely worth the price of the sale price, however for it being such a short season (only 3 discs, totalling 9 \\"hour\\" long episodes)I wouldn't pay over $20 for this. $15 would be ideal, but I paid $18.99 which wasn't bad - less than the price of most 2 hour movies (and this is about 6.5 hours long total).
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Awesome movie and very entertaining. Never boring. I've seen it several times now and I never do that with movies. In fact, I seldom go to the theater. And to think this is just the rehearsals! Go see it-you will be very pleasantly surprised as I was!      And to \\"Editorial Reviewer\\" Fenessey: MJ didn't \\"claim his earpiece wasn't working\\" which you say caused him to \\"flubb\\" J5 lyrics- gee I think he knows those pretty well ya think. He was saying that he was not raised using earpieces in performance and the sound level felt like a fist in his ears. He didn't miss any lyrics, he stopped the performance to comment on the effect that the earpieces were having on him and the difficulty he was having in adjusting to their use. Did you actually watch this  movie carefully before you reviewed it? (Or are you one of \\"those\\"?) Please change this review to reflect what really happened in the movie that we can all SEE and HEAR.

B00003CX9W|5.0|Some 60 years ago my father took me to see the original picture, that changed my perception of Music.  Since then, classical music has been one of my main interests, and also a help in difficult moments.  Disney was a visionary, and his idea of renewed music programmes in cinemas can be now a very positive help to improve the cultural level of any country.
0385504225|3.0|This book has already been thoroughly reviewed. I'm only weighing in on the language, sex, and violence.    Foul Language - Some of the foulest in a low to moderate amount. It didn't move me to stop reading the book.  Sex - A few references to having had sex. Some references to a huge \\"sex organ\\". No sex scenes. Nothing graphic.  Violence - About the amount you would expect in a PG-13 movie thriller. A severed hand. Multiple violent murders. Blowing up buildings. Gun shooting. A torture chamber and torture scenes. It's not dwelt on or explicitly described, but there's lots of violence.    I did read the entire book and I found it to be an entertaining read, nothing more, nothing less.
159562015X|1.0|Several other reviewers said that the book is useless without the code to access the assessment tool. I disagree - I thought the assessment tool was useless and got just as much out of reading the different descriptions in the book. The assessment provides two statements and asks you to choose between them as well as how strongly you associate with your choice. I felt that many of the choices were false dichotomies, the two options were not opposites and many times I agreed equally and strongly about both statements. You'd be better off asking your spouse, friends or colleagues what your strengths are. Don't waste your money on this book.
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Guitar Worlds interview with Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King before the release of World Painted Blood stated, \\"We are the AC/DC of thrash metal\\". Words cannot be anymore accurate than that. Slayers 10th disc fires on all cylinders, just like they always have. The phrase \\"if you like one, you will like them all\\" may sound negative to some and cliche' to others, but there has not been one Slayer album that I have disliked ever in my 20+ years of listening to them. World Painted Blood does not differ in the slightest. What I have always liked about Slayer is that you can listen to it once through, get a sense of the song structure, and be humming along to it the second time through. Slayers consistent goal to please its fans should not go unnoticed, considering the fact that they have been ripped to shreds by reviewers when they have even remotely altered their sound at all. Never can you please everyone. This is a band that obviously loves what they do and it shows, considering their not the pups that they used to be. World Painted Blood also has some of the meanest and creepiest lyrics that they have ever written, that goes along pretty well with the Playing With Dolls DVD in the deluxe edition. The instrumental execution of the songs are spot on and vicious as well. I am not going to get into a song by song breakdown, others have done an excellent job of that, I will just say it rocks. So don't be a Slayer fan and hate this one. Their commitment to serve as thrash metals kings should be highly justified. Like I said, its Slayer, that's all that needs to be said.

B001I0T92Q|4.0|Using this in a Sony PSP Slim w/ 2 Sandisk 16Gb Class 2 memory cards. It has worked flawlessly from day one in my system. Followed instructions exactly, key is that the microsd cards must be inserted into the adapter and then the entire MS is formatted in the device just like a normal MS.     This is a replacement for another/different uSD adapter I had purchased (it was one of the black ones also offered here on Amazon). But that one broke after a week. After that experience, I treated this MS with much more care than I usually do for a typical MS. So, honestly, I don't know if the other one broke because of mishandling or poor build quality or both but the bottom line is, given the size of the components here, these adapters are going to be most reliable if they are left in the device and not messed with much. Fortunately, with 32Gb, that is not going to be a big problem for a while. :)     My tips for a potential PSP buyer would be:  1. Follow the instructions for formatting of the MS Pro and it'll be compatible. I've been using mine for months now.  2. Use your PSP and USB cord as your memory stick reader/connection rather than popping the card and putting it in a \\"drive\\" type reader.  3. Only pop and swap the card minimally, in general. I don't swap cards between this PSP and others anymore.  4. Go for bigger capacity microsd cards right off the bat, so you won't feel like you need to swap or mess with the uSD cards. I think removing and inserting the uSD is the biggest risk for damage given the small contacts and flexible nature of the device when the uSDs are removed. (I'm pretty sure this is how I broke my first one).   5. Consider buying two adapters.    The value this product represents over a 32gb MS Pro Duo (the adapter + uSD cards cost less than my local Best Buy charges for a 16Gb MS), the extra care and handling is worth it. In fact, I can't even find 32Gb MS Pro Duos for sale anywhere and my understanding is that even when they are available they currently cost more than the actual PSP system, itself!    A 32Gb PSP is an amazing portable entertainment device to behold! :)
0385504225|3.0|I felt there were many unecessary chapters in this book.  Toooooo much detail!  Way too long.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This is an edited review.  This is It, is a spectacular production worthy of numerous film and music awards.  This is one product that no one will forget.  The concert that almost was. I was fortunate to have seen the movie 8 times. Each time was an event and a discovery of something new.    I just finished watching 7 promotional release videos on YouTube. These videos show more of the creative genius involved than was seen during the theatrical release of the movie.    [...]    By now most should have seen the TII \\"Light Man\\" video, if not it is found on Amazon. There is no doubt in my mind after having viewed just the promotional videos, that had Michael Jackson lived, it would have been a very long time before he retired from concert performances.    IN THE EVENT YOU ARE WONDERING WHAT IS ON THE VARIOUS DISC GO TO AMAZON UK  THEIR SITE PROVES COMPLETE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION. (SEE BOTTOM OF PAGE.)

B0027ZEHGO|5.0|\\"Sicko,\\" a critique of the American private health insurance system, is Michael Moore's most powerful and affecting film.  It is stylistically less flamboyant than Moore's earlier efforts - no ambush interviews for instance - but presents poignant cases of American lives ruined by callous HMO's like Kaiser.  The film is long and comprehensive, covering perspectives from within and without the system (including repentant former HMO employees who discuss rejection of care).<br /><br />Intuitively, we know that our system is broken; most working-class people have or know of HMO horror stories.  In my case, Kaiser physicians lied to me about my cancer prognosis in order to minimize their treatment costs.<br /><br />One of the strongest elements of the film involves Moore's travels through Canada, the U.K., France, and (gulp) Cuba.  There, the lives of health care providers and patients compare favorably with their counterparts in the U.S.  It shows that the private system in the U.S. is neither inevitable nor really desirable, and starkly reveals the inhumanity of corporate-managed care.<br /><br />As socio-politically divided as our nation is, I doubt that there are many open-minded people who will flock to see this film.  Many Americans regard private enterprise with religious zeal, and recoil in horror at words like \\"socialism.\\"  Nevertheless, if you consider yourself amenable to open discussion of sensitive issues like health care, \\"Sicko\\" is worth a look.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This turntable works great.  I had a little trouble setting it up, but called the help line at Sony and they finished walking me through it.  It's way more sound studio than I need, but I love it for the simpler functions that I need it for.  Very impressed with the quality, and I don't impress easily.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|After seeing Firefly I had a real appreciation for the comedic timing of Nathan Fillion. But the great thing about that series and its' big screen installment 'Serenity', was that it created a wonderful platform that also showcased the amount of heart he puts into a character. When I saw commercials for Castle I knew I wanted to give it a shot. I was so highly entertained by the wit and charm of both leads. Not to mention the chemistry that they exude. This show is not just the regular will they or won't they treatment.The personal moments of revelation for the leads gives a depth to the 'relationship' that they are building. It is quirky and smart with a wonderful supporting cast and some very potent cases. The first season has it's lite and funny moments, with the characters shooting out their own one-liners at crime scenes, (which I think is more tongue in cheek service for some other forensic shows and their one-liners). The lite moments make for some powerful contrast to the earnest and heartfelt responses that the characters have over such cases involving a child abduction as just one example of the cases that cut a little too close to home.   A show that is always entertaining, with it's own spin on the who-dunnit crime drama. It is so much more than that. Not just fitting of being called drama (crime drama) or comedy. It is such a rare blend that touches many bases and yet doesn't seem to fail. It falls in the category for me like the show 'Due South'. At some moments quirky, charming, romantic, comedic, dramatic, while always backed up by heart.   If you like a show that gives those little details- family moments for Castle- (great mother/son moments) (touching father/daughter moments)   Some character backstory for Beckett (loss of her mother) (the audience knowing she is totally in love with Castle's ...writing) She was a major fan which is a wonderful way to play off why she would fall for this sometimes immature novelist.  More little details- the cardgames- (you have to watch to know what I mean)  And wonderful character interaction with all of the supporting characters of the police department. Tamala Jones and Stana Katic (the dress sequence/girlfriend moment at Beckett's) - another must see moment.   Very nice to see a program that gives the little moments in between the standard action that can make a show seem very nuts and bolts.  For a truly fun ride I would seriously recommend checking out Castle. If you think I'm wrong let the show speak for itself. You won't be disappointed.
0385504225|2.0|Dan Brown has basically rewritten The Da Vinci Code and simply inserted Masonic symbology for Christian symbology.  I found the mystery porton tiresome.  Been there, read that.

0439023483|4.0|I need to create a \\"kept me up to 3am\\" category! I have a few books on my shelves that have done that, kept me so enthralled that I just knew I couldn't sleep until I found out what happened. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS.<br /><br />A post-apocalyptic world has been divided into twelve zones of production. The 13th zone was destroyed because they would not submit to the new Capitol's rule. Katniss lives in zone 12, a coal mining district in what was once Appalachia, with her mother and younger sister. She has been the one who provided most of the food for the table since her father's death and her mother's subsequent depression.<br /><br />The Capitol demands tribute from each district of one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18. They are sent to the Capitol and then on to the Hunger Games - a constantly filmed huge arena where one teen can live in order to win fame, fortune and never be hungry again. To survive, the teens must either kill the other players or starve/freeze them out.<br /><br />Katniss is horrified when her little sister, who is put into the name drawing for the first time when she turns 12, is selected for the Hunger Games. She volunteers to take her sister's place and then it's off to the Capitol.<br /><br />I won't spoil it, but there's sequels!
B002P7UCMC|4.0|This review is specific for the Special Edition version of the album. The actual 11 songs of the album are all very excellent. this is no doubt their heaviest album to date, and i love it. my favorite song off of it is by far \\"Waidmann's Heil.\\" All the songs are absolutely amazing except for three things. this is just my opinion, but \\"Wiener Blut\\" is hard to listen to without my mind just drifting off about a minute in. Second, the riffs in \\"Rammlied\\" and \\"Mehr\\" are almost, if not, EXACTLY the same. and third, i cant help but think that the whistling in \\"Roter Sand\\" sounds like the globetrotters theme.    and now for the reason i rated the special edition specifically 4 stars. the only thing thats really different is the extra CD, and all they really are are just different versions of \\"Roter Sand,\\" which im glad they put on a differet disk, cuz i tried listening to all of them, and frankly got annoyed by the repetetiveness of all the tracks.     i recommend getting the standard edition of the album, but if you absolutely MUST have this, the i say go for it. this is an absolutely amazing album.

B002H3F7F6|1.0|Just one more opinion on the negative side.  I wanted to find something to like about this, it's Sting after all. But the weird thing he is doing to his voice and the lyrics themselves make it impossible for me.  The voice style thing is just pretentious.  Why does he need to sing in what he believes is the style of the time and subjuct 21st century people to it?  Sting, we aren't in the 13th Century, sitting around our castle fireplaces drinking mead. We don't want to lament...    I realize this isn't supposed to be a Christmas album, God forbid he does something commercial.  BUT, a Christmas album by Sting would be a very welcome addition, as he already did a beautiful rendition of Gabriel's message(unlike this new horrible one) and a nice version of I Saw Three Ships on other CD's. Maybe he should just lighten up and sing Holly Jolly Christmas, can you imagine it?  No, me either, BUT...it would be better than this mix or THE LUTE CD!      I'll be waiting to see what Sting comes up with next. Hopefully something that makes sense and is influenced by the recent reunion tour.  Which was great by the way, saw two shows.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|Sons of Anarchy is a unique blend of drama, sensitivity, romance and violence all ingredients to make this series compelling and different. It is raw and edgy at times but this is all a necessary factor to the story lines. The violent scenes are not excessive or intrusive, but justified to the story line. Life is not sugary sweet, and underworld crime does exist. The way this series is portrayed is one of a kind. Highly recommended if you like something a bit different. Hard to believe Charlie Hunnam is English - he does the American portrayal so well. Katey Sagal is such a versatile actor she has my highest praise, tough but warm - hard to play role but she has it down to a fine art. I enjoyed this series and look forward to the next.
0061730327|4.0|The title, as in many books, is a little misleading.  I was expecting to get right into a story of the mechanics of a complicated wind- mill system developed by a young man.  I stayed with the book, however, on the lesson to always read at least the first 100 pages of a book before you decide not to complete reading it.  I am glad I did.  The story got better and better to where I could not put the book down.  The writing was very good, although it did not sound in the voice of Kamkwamba, rather the voice of Mealer.  However, it was very easy to read, and a great story, I would recommend this book to anybody - fiction and non-fiction readers.

B00005JLF5|5.0|A lot of people point out that Season One of STAR TREK DEEP SPACE 9 suffered from growing pains and that is certainly true.  DS9 was, in my opinion, the best of all the STAR TREK series, and it while the storylines that drove the series and made it such an enormously enjoyable series were not there in the early seasons, it wasn't like the show was mud in the early seasons.  In fact, while the show got incredibly good in later seasons, it was still, even in its first couple of seasons, absolutely first rate.<br /><br />One of the ironies for me is that if I were to do a list of my all time favorite STAR TREK characters, few from DS9 would make the list.  Odo is perhaps my favorite, but as a rule I find the cast to be more than the some of the parts.  For instance, I think it is a better ensemble cast than VOYAGER, but I like The Doctor and Seven more than anyone on DS9.  But this cast really fits together well in telling stories and even in Season One, before the big story arcs get under way, they feel like a great team.<br /><br />DS9 is famously the darkest ST series, with more ongoing storylines than any other ST series.  In a way, having the series set in a particular location helps lead to this.  The original series, THE NEXT GENERATION, and VOYAGER were all focused on spaceships always in motion and always encountering new species and planets and phenomena.  But DS9 would have gotten old quick with nothing but a visitor-of-the-week fomat.  And given the initial premise of the Federation on DS9 acting as a buffer between the Bajorans and the Cardassians.  With the later addition of the Maquis and the meeting of the Dominion, the show had a degree of political and narrative complexity utterly lacking in the other series.  In many ways, DS9 is more reminiscent of BABYLON 5 than THE NEXT GENERATION.  It is interesting, by the way, that those two shows, that resemble each other in many ways, ran almost concurrently.<br /><br />What is most delightful in rewatching this is how well it has stood up over time.  Part of it is that its aesthetic and tone anticipated what has become more pervasive in TV SF.  This was true even before Ronald D. Moore moved over to DS9 from TNG at the start of Season Three.  Moore, of course, was the creator of the reimagined BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  I've just finished rewatching Seasons One and Two and have begun Season Three.  I don't want to say that Moore was the only reason the show got so good in Season Three, but he was clearly one of the reasons.  But my point here is that even in Seasons One and Two, before it got completely into gear, it was a very good and enjoyable series.as stood up over time.

B0012GMWI4|5.0|It is possible to miss this gorgeous music or to dismiss it as something that sounds good but is not your thing. It is just not cool enough and a bit too accessible and pop like for you too be into Travis, you might say. That would be a huge mistake on your part. Some of their most beautiful and ambitious songs can be found on their latest Ode To J. Smith album (it is 2009 now) and I have a feeling that it will not be very long for Travis to shower us with more jewels. I am choosing this album The Invisible Band because it contains even more great songs on it that either The Man Who or Ode To J. Smith (obviously that is a matter of personal preference). I hardly ever listen to any Travis album from A to Z. I much prefer to listen to this kind of music as part of my... greater listening experience, by mixing it with things...less accessible. However, some of the most beautiful songs I often hear, I hear when I load my Travis compilation into my cd changer. My favorite songs of Travis are: Before You Were Young, Luv, Side, I Love You Anyways, Turn, The Humpty Dumpty Love Song, Quite Free, Driftwood, Battleships, Chinese Blues, Sing, The Last Laugh Of The Laughter, Safe, Slide Show, Afterglow, Re-Offender, More Than Us, Dear Diary.
B001AKF3H4|4.0|When it has came down to it, back in the 1990's the music industry had been known for the best movie songs that have topped the Billboard Charts. There was Celine Dion, whom had been known for her signature ballads like My Heart Will Go On from Titanic, and When I Fall In Love from Sleepless In Seattle. But, while Celine had a lot of great movie songs, nobody had dominated the movies in singing and in acting in the 90's like Whitney Houston. Her reign as a singer/actress had not lost its luster with the massive success of her signature songs like Exhale from Waiting To Exhale becoming the first movie song to debut at #1 on the singles charts, a Oscar-Winning song with When You Believe from The Prince Of Egypt, and her music from The Preacher's Wife in 1996, which ran for over 1 year at #1 on Billboard's Gospel charts and included a signature remake of The Four Tops standard I Belive In You And Me. But when it has came down to what makes Whitney best at her ballads from films, none of them has been able to top the impact of the music from The Bodyguard, as the most successful movie soundtrack of all time. While, there are so many people whom had been turned off from Whitney Houston because of her personal issues the past several years, she had bounced back well this year with 2009's I Look To You, but there are those who just love her movie songs, than this would be the treat for you.<br /><br />The 1992 soundtrack for the movie The Bodyguard mainly showcases Whitney Houston as her signature voice, with the music that showcased Whitney, as well as other acts like Arron Neville, the soulful and bluesy Joe Cocker, and many other acts. But, it is mainly Whitney that has the spotlight, with her biggest movie songs that still stand the test of time like the Grammy-Winning #1 track I Will Always Love You, which still is the longest-running movie song to stay at #1 on Billboard, as well as her other biggest songs including a well-rendered cover of Chaka Khan's I'm Every Woman, as well as the intimate standards Run To You and I Have Nothing. Her other songs like Queen Of The Night also hit the nail on the head well.

0312370849|3.0|Two sides of sixty years - The 1942 Vel'd'Hiv' roundup of the Jews in France with 10-year-old Sarah locking her brother in the cupboard thinking she'll return, and the 2002 story of Julia, an expat journalist assigned to write about the tragedy - a woman going through life issues brought to a head, in part, by the tragedy she covers.  The author allows these characters to alternate chapters until Sarah's story is mostly silent.      I missed Sarah - and wasn't sufficiently interested in the life of Julia.  I was horrified by the cruelties of a segment of history of which I was unaware, touched by the kindnesses shown to Sarah (particularly by the good couple), compelled by the efforts to rescue her brother (best part of the book, in my opinion), and disappointed by the predictabilities of the present-day story's characters, esp. Bertrand (Julia's husband). I didn't cry or cheer, unlike other reviewers.  The last quarter of the book felt hollow and didn't work for me.  It seemed that the author was writing for a younger audience who wouldn't see things coming (yet matters of adultery, abortion - these probably wouldn't be covered in a book for pre-teens, though possibly for teens).  Maybe this was written for and would suit a mother/daughter reading group?  I can't fault the author for simplifying matters if she was genuinely trying to get wider appeal to spread awareness of this slice of history, but I like my books a little more sophisticated - not so flat. I almost wished Julia HAD lived in the home that had been Sarah's - that might have been more interesting than the neat little package the author left.      I also felt that the continual questions in Sarah's segment grew tiresome and tried too hard to lead us without letting us ask the questions (\\"Why was this happening to her?  Why so much pain, so much suffering, thought the girl.  Why such hate?  Who had decided this and what for?\\") - they felt like a crutch.  I think Sarah's reactions in all cases were authentic, and I was very glad the points were made - just that the writing device didn't serve as well as it might have.    I liked Julia's daughter Zoe (seemed like a real and spirited person) and honestly, I did like Julia - perhaps I just didn't care enough about the modern story when compared to Sarah's story.  Just a lot of family squabbles, people finding things out or situations unfolding in a way that the reader could see from a mile away.  Even Zoe's behavior was more or less stereotypical for a \\"unique\\" girl of her age, come to think of it.  The reactions of the family and others were so predictable. You knew the love interest (who, by the way, you KNEW would be the love interest) would come to terms with things - you knew so many other things.  Unfortunate, because the book could have been so much more.    It was clear that the author did much research - it would have been nice to have included at least a brief afterword discussing resources used, reading recommendations, etc. - great for book groups as well, who gravitate to books like this and love more info.  Did she interview survivors?  By-standers?  I think many readers of historical fiction have come to expect this feature - it was crying for something like this.    Bottom line: Sarah's Key was worth reading, I kept turning the pages, but once Sarah was more or less out of the picture, I was less engaged and more frustrated.  The predictabilities cancelled out the strengths. I was glad to learn of the true story behind this novel, however, in which the fictional Sarah, according to the author, serves to inform or remind us.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Simply put, this is an outstanding documentary.  Not only does it give the viewer an inside peek into a very unhealthy, and frightening industry, it offers consumers some steps to take toward promoting change.  The bottom line is, if we do not buy inferior products, we will send a message to the food industry that we demand change. Our purchase power is our only leverage, since it is clear the government agencies are NOT on our side, and they don't have much regulatory authority, even if they were. When even Wal-Mart is now stocking some 'organic' products due to customer demand, we know we CAN be heard.  In fact, we need to be even louder, as we just say, 'NO!'<br /><br />This movie will leave you sickened by the amount of toxins we are ingesting, and the foods that are barren of nutritional content.  The statistics regarding insulin resistance and the number of diabetics expected, in this, and the next generations, are staggering.  If we look further down the road, at our already fragile health-care system,  we can readily see that with these dire health predictions, due to poor nutrition, that any system, new, or old, will not be sustainable.<br /><br />As the old saying goes, 'you can tell how civilized a population is by the way it treats its animals.' Well, it goes without saying, that we are failing miserably in this area.  However, watching the poor, enslaved workers in these processing plants, is just as uncivilized, and, a blight against humanity.<br /><br />When you finish this film, you will never put another morsel in your mouth, without thinking of the poor animals so cruelly sacrificed, the subservient farmer, those in the processing plants, the toxins ingested, or the big fat cats, who are only out to make a buck. And, don't even get me started on the soybean monopoly. This part of the story will break your heart and make you wish you could never touch soy again, in protest; but we can't avoid it---and the industry knows it. Just like we can't possibly avoid CORN, or its byproducts.<br /><br />I hope this movie will make more people think about how citizens are being manipulated for the wealth of a few.  It makes it clear we can make a difference, with a little work, and shedding the denial that has become our comfort zone.<br /><br />We must remember, when we sit down to eat that juicy steak, that the cow didn't commit suicide for us.  And, the undocumented worker, that handled the meat? He may now be in a police car, after a decade, or more, of doing a horrendous job, 'one of the most dangerous in America,' just to survive. I wouldn't doubt that they are suddenly turned in when they become burned-out and less productive, or have sustained injury.  They are considered disposable. There is a dirty story behind every morsel, before it goes through our lips, for which, we must not remain ignorant.<br /><br />Knowledge is power!byproducts.

I'd like to see more of his benefactor and her daughter, both are gorgeous, would like to see their intelligence as well. And what a great place to live! The story about the girlfriend leaving clues is very interesting... can't wait to see that play out. Love the sidekick character as well. Keep 'em coming!

B00006RAKP|2.0|beware of this cd if you already have any greatest hits cd's from Elton John....They are basically copies of two others cd's plus a few other songs from later years....This would be Ok for those that don't have either, but on one cd I own(I have two)has all the same songs and also the same poor quality( the other one is better but still some volume fluctuation between tracks... I even put it on a sound editor and all the sound waves and volume are all over the place....some of them actually \\"straight line\\" (flatten out) within the same song.....<br />  I used my sound editor to get the volume even and add some \\"cleanup\\" and bass boost and burned them to a cd...it sounds a lot better, but still not the best it could be...would benefit a great deal from re-mixing all the soundbites.<br /><br />  as is, you may be disappointed in the sound quality and the volume variance .....there is nothing more annoying than listening to a CD that has such inconsistency in the volume (even within the same track.  some of the track to track volume is so bad you will have one blasting away one minute and then can hardly hear the next....still looking for remastered/remixed tracks of older Elton John tunes  ......
B002V33ZLU|4.0|I too thought that the story was dragging out a bit without solid characters... I still intend to watch through the season. I enjoyed the last one I watched, Water, a good story. I would like to see some interaction with others in the universe, mainly for more character opportunities. I also hope they will eventually figure out how to control the ship. I think they are still lacking in great characters. Think Atlantis and SG-1. Now there were some characters to keep you watching! I was heartbroken when they ended. Maybe they just need to clarify the \\"team\\". Right now I'm thinking the braniac gamer-best character so far, the pilot and his girlfriend, the military dudes(2) and the doctor-who is an extremely unlikable guy-but necessary in my mind. I am a Stargate fan and will give this show time to grow.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game was my first sci-fi novel and remains my favorite to this day. The writing style is vivid enough to fully comprehend what is happening but vague enough to allow the reader to use his own imagination (as the author himself states). There has never been a fictitious character I have cared more for after reading a book than Andrew Wiggin. He represents so much in the human spirit. The primal instinct, the compassionate heart, the deep seated moral dichotomy between doing what one knows is right and wrong, and the ability to comprehend and accept consequences to ones action. There's a lot more here than just an action story about boys with laser guns in zero-gravity cubes and it is something every literate human should experience.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|I have been studying Amazon's updates for all things \\"This Is It\\".  I was hesitant on purchasing this CD because I knew that the first disc would have all the songs that I already have in my own collection(\\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"Earth Song\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", Smooth Criminal\\", \\"J5 Medley,\\" \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\", \\"Jam\\").  And I was right! But the second disc with the demos and spoken poem makes the purchase completely worthwhile.  I must have listened to that disc at least 3 or 4 times. I might have just fed into the MJ machine but I feel a little closer to the King with this CD. You will too!
B001N18HOG|5.0|As a Pearl Jam of the first hour, I've been following the band over its now 19 years (and counting) history, with its mostly highs and some lows. When the band announced they were about to reissue its classic debut album \\"Ten\\" for its 20th (?) anniversary, I was at first non-plussed, to be honest. But I finally gave in and checked it out. Boy, amd I glad I did.<br /><br />\\"Ten (Legacy Edition\\" (2 CDS; 28 tracks; 132 min. ) brings on CD1 (11 tracks; 53 min.) the original album in a remastered version, and it sounds as I alwasys remembered it, if a bit better. But the real deal is of course CD2 (17 tracks; 79 min.). It brings the original album remixed from scratch by Brendan O'Brian (who would mix a lot of the subsequent PJ albums), and it sounds a bit different but not all that much, to be honest. This isn't a radical retooling. The bonus tracks that follow bring the pay-off: \\"Brother\\" with vocals (there was an instrumental version on \\"Lost Dogs\\"), the tremendous \\"Just a Girl\\", an early version of \\"Breath and A Scream\\" and of \\"State of Love and Trust\\" that both rock, the previously unreleased \\"2,000 Miles Blues\\" that is as bluesy as the title implies, just great, and the short (also previously unreleased) \\"Evil Little Goat\\", the only track on here that doesn't add much.<br /><br />In all, this is a very nice 'legacy' edition to an absolute amazing debut album (although I was disappointed by the absence of liner notes to the album). Pearl Jam remains a force to be reckoned with these days, in particular in concert (I was not moved by their latest album \\"Backspacer\\"). I saw them deliver an epic 3+ hr. set at Bonnaroo 2008, which just blew me away. Can't wait for the future of Pearl Jam.
B002MU4NLI|1.0|There is absolutely NOTHING new in this DVD release as to extras - just the same old Tom Bosley \\"Making of...\\" and Frank Capra Jr.'s recollections.  It is a total shame that for AFI's # 1 Most Inspiring Film of All Time that Paramount can't come up with NEW extras!  There is so much that could be done - but isn't.  The Tom Bosley featurette is centuries old - and was originally made for TV! And it isn't all that good to begin with. So ALL you get with this new packaging is...new packaging in a cheesy Christmas tree-backed box along with a cheap little bell with \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" writ on it.  How wonderful if they had an ornament such as the one released by Hallmark in 1996 - a small tableau of George and Mary and ZuZu beside a Christmas tree.  That was a fantastic ornament!  But a tinny little bell is all you will get with this re-packaging.  So, if you have 2007's double disc set you have everything already - except for the tiny, tinny little bell.<br /><br />This year's release of \\"White Christmas\\" at least had the dignity to include several NEW extras.  And as terrific as \\"White Christmas\\" is, it is nowhere near as beloved a film as \\"Wonderful Life.\\"  Anyway - happy holidays to one and all.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|After The Gold Rush is the second remastered CD I have bought from the Neil Young Archives series. The first, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere I bought because I didn't yet own it on CD. This one I bought to compare with the old Reprise label release that I already own. After listening to both of them many times, it seems that the benefits of the remastering accrue much more to the former album than to this one. As one reviewer noted, the remastering done thus far for the Archival Series is more apparent on the electric pieces.  As far as the music goes, After The Gold Rush is one of the most important albums of the last half of the 20th century. And while a remaster is long overdue, I have to strain my ears to notice any appreciable improvements on most songs. The benefits of the remaster are most apparent on the smug, preachy yet still powerful Southern Man. Elsewhere the benefits are quite underwhelming.  Like the Reprise issue, this CD is accompanied by an attractive booklet containing lyrics, pictures, and important album information. If you already own this on CD, whether an upgrade is worth the added expense depends on the quality of your sound system. But then, this remaster is so inexpensive it will be hard to resist. I look forward to further releases in the series.
B001PR0YDA|5.0|I went to the midnight show of Disney's 'A Christmas Carol' last night and going into it, I was really excited. I was lucky enough to see the train tour that went around the country to promote the film and even got to see director Robert Zemeckis talk about the film at the D23 Expo. I'm a big fan of the Charles Dickens story as well, of course my two favorite film versions star Kermit the Frog and Mickey Mouse.    Disney's new motion capture film is wonderful! I absolutely loved it, and I'm usually not a fan of motion capture. Jim Carrey is fabulous as Scrooge and the three ghosts. This adaptation is more faithful to the Charles Dickens classic than any other film version. In fact, it even begins with the opening of the book. And I found the 3D to be more impressive than Disney's previous 3D releases. In this film, items appear to pop off the screen and into the theater.    Overall, I loved this new version and will definitely see it again in theaters. However, I must warn anybody with small children that this film is scary. In fact, it made me jump twice. I have to say that my favorite film version is still 'The Muppet Christmas Carol,' mainly because it's fun and has a lighter tone, but this new version is very good. This is sure to become an annual tradition for families to watch every holiday season.

0375707972|5.0|As I read Schlink's novel, it was nearly impossible to believe it was not a memoir. It was also nearly impossible to put down. I started reading the book yesterday morning, and for the entire day I took it everywhere with me. I read it in waiting rooms, traffic jams, while the potatoes were boiling. And at the end of the day, I picked it up knowing that I would not sleep until I had come to the end.<br /><br />The honesty with which Schlink approaches the inherited guilt of the \\"second generation\\" of Germans, those who were born either during or just after the war, was truly remarkable. While the book is ostensibly about the love affair between a young man and a former concentration camp guard, it is really a showcase for all of the moral, ethical and personal dilemmas faced by these alienated post-war Germans. Schlink tackles the problem of inherited guilt with a clarity of vision that is startling in its depth. At one point Michael asks the plaintive question: \\"..we of the second generation were silenced by revulsion, shame and guilt--was that all there was to it now?\\" (p 104). That silence--manifested in the numbness which was shared by both the victims and their persecutors,as well as by Michael himself--was symbolically and materially represented by Hannah's illiteracy.<br /><br />Illiteracy, the inability to read and write, was Hanna's downfall. But in a deeper sense, Hanna's illiteracy represents the unwillingness to become self-educated, to make the independent, informed decisions that all Germans faced under the Nazis. Indeed, Hanna's \\"illiteracy\\" is something we all share. The Milgram experiments, originally intended to discover what it was about Germans that made them so cooperative with Nazi outrages, demonstrated beyond the shadow of a doubt that most people, anywhere, will cooperate with atrocities. (I would strongly encourage anyone who believes the Germans were somehow \\"different\\" to read up on the Milgram experiments.)<br /><br />Eventually the silence of complicity is overcome by Hanna herself, when she finally cures herself of illiteracy. When Michael discovers the literature of the Holocaust in Hanna's cell--Primo Levi, Elie Wiesel, Hannah Arendt--he begins to weep. That scene represents one of the most moving and significant statements of faith in humanity that I have ever encountered: We can all overcome our complicity. We can all overcome our ignorance. We can all overcome our silence.vercome by Hanna herself, when she finally cures herself of illiteracy.

1433502402|4.0|The ESV Study Bible is a well made quality sewn bound Bible in both hardcover and leather editions.      The book introductions, notes, and articles are excellent as are the illustrations and maps.  The notes come from a mildly calvinist perspective and are thoroughly written.  The ESV is one of the best translations out there for accuracy and readability.  This Bible is well constructed and the paper quality is top notch!      The Articles and Resources in the back of this Bible cover everything from Doctrinal Overview, Ethics, Bible Interpretation, to World Religions and Cults.  There's not much more that could be added to a Bible.  If I had any constructive criticism it would be that perhaps there are too many helps making this a large, heavy Bible to carry to church although people are doing it.      I rate this Bible as 4 stars because, although excellent, like other ESV Bibles it has a poor concordance as compared to most study Bibles on the market.  Having said that, you won't go wrong with this Bible which truly illuminates the Word of God!

B000V8I2QU|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of Bruce but I do love several of his songs and he has my highest respect as a musician, songwriter, performer. That said, \\"Radio Nowhere\\" is one of the best songs i've heard in a long while (just listened to it 4 times in a row in fact) and i'm on Amazon to decide if I should get the entire album. Reading the reviews I see many are dissatisfied with the sound of the record and I agree that it could sound better. The reason for the poor quality is attributable to the mastering of the record which, for those who don't know, is the final process in the production of a song/album. The mastering process is supposed to be an overall review/tweak of all the songs to be included on an album, after they are mixed, to create a homogeneous overall sound - similar EQ, levels, etc. What mastering has become however, is a loudness war instigated by the RECORD COMPANIES to one-up the loudness of latest pop song. In the eyes of the record cos, sounds louder = sounds better. This is true to to a certain extent, sound quality is increased as loudness is increased. But after a certain point, sound quality diminishes with increased loudness, resulting in distortion, harshness and ear fatigue, which is why many of you stopped listening to the record even though you like the music. What happened in this case is indicative of the recent/negative trend in the mastering process. Here's the likely scenario: A label exec stands over the shoulder of the mastering engineer and says \\"Make it louder.\\" The mastering engineer says, \\"But...\\". The label exec says \\"Make it louder.\\" I'm sure the pre-mastered recording sounds great and Brendan O'Brien probably cringed when he heard the final product, but he won't bite the hand that feeds him so won't intercede. And don't blame the mastering engineer either. He'd love master it at say, early 90s levels (How good does Nirvana/Nevermind sound?)    Try this: listen to several songs spanning the BS catalog. Notice that the songs get louder the more recently they were released. Notice also that they sound progressively better and then, suddenly worse. This is highlights the change in the approach to mastering which has occurred over time.    Why did I just spend 45 mins typing into the void? Because this issue REALLY angers me. I can barely listen to many modern recordings because modern recordings are mastered TOO LOUD. The labels are to blame.

B0013FNC38|3.0|Jason Mraz is the kind of sweetly done adult pop that gets the occasional breakthrough, and his \\"We Sing...\\" is the 2008/9 model. His airy, [[ASIN:B000Z0UEU6 Jack Johnson]] copy, \\"I'm Yours,\\" broke Billboard chart records of longevity, and was the most omnipresent earworm since [[ASIN:B000301YY8 James Blunt's]] \\"You're Beautiful.\\" That song has made Jason a newly minted star, but how does his breakthrough CD hold up? Like a Hostess cupcake. He'll sing about it, dance for it, but that cupcake is one that Jason would consider himself too nice a guy to shoplift.<br /><br />\\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" offers up creamy observations on love and life, overproduced goopy ballads and sweet folky pastries. When it works (\\"I'm Yours,\\" \\"Lucky\\" with [[ASIN:B002DHSGVI Colbie Caillat]]), it makes for solid easy listening fair. When it doesn't (\\"The Dynamo of Volition\\"), Jason comes of as really annoying white-bread soul without much depth. And frankly, the sterile horn charts and string sections often make the songs sound over-produced. If you listen without digging in too deep, \\"We Sing...\\" is pleasant enough, but paying stricter attention shows an artist playing it way too safe.

I feel sorry for the author who seems to know too much about how to violate women (should be interesting to find out why) and the readers who gave such glowing reviews.  Does assault and victomization really entertain those sad souls?  Whatever happened to nurturing and protecting people?  Larsson, you should be ashamed to write such trash.
0060765380|1.0|One word; silly.      Man, this book was brutal, from it's ridiculous, which may not even be a strong enough word, character Monk to its cartoonish action scenes.  I was dying, DYING for this thing to end (I try to finish what I start).    The marine biologist's, or patient zero's (or whatever)story is so illogical that I would expect Santa to come down my chimney before anything like that happened to anyone.    The scenes are drawn out, the dialogue is unrealistic, and the octopuses come off as aliens.  It's a science fiction book.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|Michael Buble new album Crazy Love isn't as good as I thought it would be.  There are 13 tracks on this CD and there are really only 4 of them that I like.  None of them are really bad though-just not the greatest.  Of course I have my favorites.  Listed below are the tracks on the CD:    1) Cry Me A River  2) All of Me  3) Georgia On My Mind  4) Crazy Love  5) Haven't Met You Yet  6) All I Do Is Dream of You  7) Hold On  8) Heartache Tonight  9) You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You  10)  Baby (You've Got What It Takes)  11) At This Moment  12) Stardust  13) Whatever It Takes    Some of these songs are easy listening while others are fun.  My favorites are Georgia On My Mind, Cry Me A River, and All of Me.  If you like Michael Buble, you will like this album.  I wish there were a few more songs on this CD I could get into though.  There are still a few songs I really love so I guess it's like any other CD.  Most of the time-no matter whose CD it is-there are only a few that I like on the album.  But if you are a Michael Buble fan, I still recommend Crazy Love!
0061914177|5.0|Like the title infers, I found this book to be a total kick in the pants.  The things that Gary talked about (social media for marketing) and so on and so forth were things that I've had thoughts about and knew were teeming with promise, but just never acted upon them.  Gary shows you exactly how to act on those ideas and make them work for you...and that's through work, hard work, lots of hard work.    This is one of those books that doesn't MAKE you do anything, but gets you excited and want to get up off the couch and start working towards your dream until you can't stay awake another second.  In Gary's words, you start 'Crushing It'.    This is a must read for anyone who aspires to be an entrepreneur...a great perspective from a great talent to add to your arsenal.

B0019LY5I2|1.0|I've been a GI Joe fan since the original Larry Hama comic. When I heard they were going to make a GI Joe movie, I hoped it would pull it's source material from the comic since it has an excellent story and excellent characters. Unfortunately any similarities between either the comic or the cartoon is superficial at best.     I Hate when a movie comes out based on a earlier book or TV show and completely disregards the original source material.     Larry Hama build an incredibly compelling relationship between Snake eyes and Scarlett that is the core of the comic.  Watching them completely ignore that in this movie killed any enjoyment I could have gotten out of the action scenes.

B002MW50KO|5.0|My CD arrived early and in excellent condition.  I eagerly tore through the wrappings in a hurry to listen to it in my car.  The very first song brought a smile to my face, and stayed there for the rest of the album.  Ocassionally I lol as his whiskey- and -smoke abused vocal cords were stretched to a limit, but the slower blusey numbers hit the right cord.  We had a freaky snow shower this day, and as I listened to MR. DYLAN croon out \\"have yourself a merry little Christmas\\", I got some Christmas spirit two months early!   After all these years of listening to  COMO, AUTRY, MATHIS, CROSBY, etc., it took BOB TO MAKE ME LISTEN TO THE WORDS OF THESE SONGS AGAIN.  wHAT A MAN!!
B002VECMA4|3.0|A man's wife leaves him. The man happens to be Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor), a small town newspaper journalist. To impress his wife and make her see him in a different light, Bob enlists to Iraq as a war correspondent. Sipping a drink in a plush Kuwaiti hotel, resignedly waiting for the green light to cross to Iraq, he meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), a garbage can company representative in search of a contract (or so he says). Bob is immediately intrigued. Not so long ago, he heard of Lyn in the course of an interview with a retired army soldier. Lyn's supposed psychic powers prove to be too much for Bob the Journalist to resist and he joins Lyn on his sojourn into Iraq. In the process, he discovers the (brief) story of the American Jedi, the soldiers of the U.S. Army's New Earth Battalion; the psychic warriors...<br /><br />As I am one of the few adult women in the US who consider Clooney's sex appeal only a click above Mr. Rogers', there was a single compelling reason for me to see this film: its title. Unfortunately, the film does not live up to it. Yes, there are goats, men, and plenty of staring, but... the zany comedy/satire one is expecting never actually materializes. For a comedy, there are not enough laughs. For a satire, the pun is too diluted and lacking of a consistent object. The story frequently changes direction, until you feel it is the director's wish to keep the main plot hidden from you. When the film's conclusion finally arrives with a whimper, it forces you to ask: was the hour and a half leading up to this ending worth my time? The answer, in my case, was NO.<br /><br />Still, the acting is excellent. Bridges as the stoner and Spacey as the villain are satisfying (if not predictable). There are a few good lines that may elicit a chuckle here and there. As long as you do not expect a fast action comedy, or a wise, stay-with-you-long-after-the-viewing satire, you may be able to enjoy some parts of the film...
B002PL8SWY|4.0|This set is wonderful, what all box sets should be. The book is great, the packaging is great but fragile. The spine between the LPs is very thin and mine tore just removing the record. The bonus disc is too short and lackluster BUT it is great to hear BB and Tina at their primal best. It is still a great deal and a worthwhile set.

Being a young newlywed myself I could not imagine losing my husband so soon as she did; and having the strength to move on with life..  I could not stop talking about this book to my husband, as I finished reading for a day I would tell him what was happening.  He will not read a book, so I thought we could watch the movie together (he is good that way, he will watch chick flicks with me).  Boy was that the biggest mistake ever!!  I hated the movie, it was nothing like the book at all!!  I was embarrased to have asked my husband sit through those 2 wasted hours that we will never get back.  I can't imagine liking this movie even if I hadn't read the book.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this movie
B0017HMF6W|5.0|\\"NORTH BY NORTHWEST\\" (1959)<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this is the 50th anniversary of Alfred Hitchcock's great romantic thriller starring a perfectly cast Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint and marvelous supporting work by a \\"jealous\\" James Mason, a \\"gay\\" Martin Landau and an always droll Leo G. Carroll as a cynical and unflappable government agent.<br />But at the heart of this terrific film that never seems old lies the brilliant \\"double-chase\\" original screenplay by the late Ernest Lehman.<br />Inspired by a notion Hitchcock expressed to Lehman that he always wanted to direct a movie that included a chase across the faces of Mt. Rushmore, the two film geniuses slowly built a story from that lowly beginning.<br /><br />Lehman was inspired to maintain a tone of a sometimes funny but always thrilling and finally romantic plot that never lags and ends with the iconic climax that Hitchcock initially ordered.<br />In preproduction it was called \\"The Man in Lincoln's Nose.\\"  The idea of the main character running from and to something and keeping him almost as confused as the audience about what was really going on has now connected in a direct way to three generations of movie lovers.  By identifying with our on-screen hero, we can be brave, witty, loyal to something noble and be rewarded with true love.<br /><br />Lehman's great creation of a dapper movie hero who remains confident, debonair and witty is the model for the cinematic transition of James Bond from a lesser literary figure to a screen personae.<br /><br />Hitchcock was trained as an artist and his films are composed with an efficient eye to visualizing the emotion of the story with images first and dialogue second.  He worked out everything - all the shots -- on note cards.  He said that when he was done with his story-board, he felt he had already directed the film.  When he was actually shooting scenes, he rarely exposed film that could be edited in any way other than what he had already determined.<br />Bernard Herrmann's memorable score, certainly among his best, adds immensely to the tone of the film; never forecasting events but always supporting the tension or romance.  For many, recalling certain films, it's Hermann's score that first comes to mind.  (Try thinking of \\"Psycho\\" without the screeching violins.)<br /><br />This week (as of this writing) Warner Bros. is releasing new editions of a restored \\"North By Northwest\\" on DVD and Blu-ray.  The extras include commentary by writer Lehman, a making-of documentary and a two fine new featurette that examines the cinema art of Hitchcock.<br /><br />One's contemporary cultural education is not complete without experiencing this iconic film.

B00180R06I|5.0|\\"VAMPYR\\" (1932)<br /><br />None other than Alfred Hitchcock deemed Carl Theodor Dryer's \\"Vampyr\\" the \\"only film worth watching - twice!\\"<br /><br />The first sound film by one founding architects of cinema itself, delivers a palpable, sensual experience that few works of film can match.  Director Dryer is a hypnotist and the film will put you in a waking dream that scratches blood from the skin of the supernatural.<br /><br />This strangely layered film is about the journey of a man named Allan Gray who is drawn to a countryside inn by ghostly forces.  Allan gray is played convincingly by \\"Julien West,\\" who in real life was the secretive Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg!  At the inn, Gray becomes involved with the family that lives there and the ghosts and demons that also seem to be part of the family.  But it's Grays attraction to the sexually charged virgin daughter Giselle that seals his fate and final his confrontation with the ultimate vampyr - Death itself.  Interestingly, Giselle is played by the \\"great, accursed Sybelle Schmitz,\\" whose real life was as interesting as her screen personas.<br /><br />The final moments of asphyxiation in the blasphemed bodies of the horrific bat-men have probably had more influence on horror cinema than any other.<br />Long out of circulation in an acceptable transfer, Criterion's recently restored digital edition make this truly terrifying landmark film new again.  (Not rated, full frame, 75 minutes)
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I had no expectations of being disappointed with a Disney/Pixar BD, and being that it took me a whole dedicated day to get through everything, I now feel it was worth every penny. The film was enjoyable, funny, sad, and scary filled with some nice messages about life and loss. I can understand why the majority of my customers loved it.<br /><br />The Blu clarity is outstanding, and the amount of reference points are extensive, but one that stands out the most for contrast lines would have to be when the house is entering the lair (balloons against the dark cavern). The sound is selectable between 5.1 DTS, 2.0 DTS and Descriptive English. The 5.1 was beautiful with tons of reference points, sometimes excruciating (that bird screeching) but thorough nonetheless. Now for the supplements (all times in minutes):<br /><br />DISC 1: (BD)<br />* 5:46 Partly Cloudy short film. Was hilarious. A great depth test for your display with the clouds. Nice little message of tolerance no matter how difficult someone might be.<br />* 4:40 Dug's Mission. An almost lo-def looking short take on our main dog dealing with the main three baddies on a chase.<br />* 22:17 Adventure Out There. A must see documentary about the crew taking the actual trip to the Tepui location in South America. A beautiful travel infomercial in itself. Loved how their guide only wore sandles for the ascent and hikes.<br />* 4:56 Alternate Scenes Ending of Muntz. Sketches and interviews regarding different endings for that bad guy that they had come up with.<br />* 1:00 How-to on using the Digital Copy.<br />* Cine Explore option while watching the film. The two directors give their commentary with multiple pop-up screens showing art, ideas, etc.<br />* Screen Saver. Allows you to set a time period for your screen saver to activate.<br />* Maximize Your Home Theater. The standard Pixar multi-step process for setting all of your theater capabilities.<br /><br />DISC 2: (BD)<br />Documentaries<br />* 6:24 Geriatric Hero. History behind the creation of our old guy. All of these documentaries are interview oriented with sketches and film clips to supplement.<br />* 8:26 Canine Companions. In depth analysis on the breed choices, training and dog behavior studied to get the dogs in the film to be more - dog like.<br />* 9:00 Russel Wild Explorer. Covers the reasons for his character to have the loss and why he was \\"egg\\" shaped as opposed to other sketch ideas.<br />* 5:04 Kevin (bird). Nice reference to the Swiss Family Robinson ostrich; covered the hardest part of any of these animation films - the feathers.<br />* 4:38 Homemakers Pixar. Enjoyed the work that went into them studying sub-floors and lighting options in making this look so real in the house.<br />* 6:25 Balloons and Flight. Tells the now famous number of balloons used; some interesting dirigible history; shows the Pixar group using that local Bay Area air service I keep seeing fly around here (research stuff).<br />* 7:37 Composing for Characters. Have to be into the musical/scoring stuff for this one.<br /><br />Extras<br />* Global Guardian Badge Game. After the initial setup of name, difficulty levels and tutorial material, the game has an extensive amount of country/geography material. Customers grouped around and we did fine for the United States section, but we randomly tried Africa and we bombed (some of the countries they were asking for I hadn't heard of in years) - good learning tool though.<br />* 9:15 Alternate Scene - Married Life. Another sketch/interview piece about more material being removed/added into that section of the film. The scene itself would have been only a minute longer.<br />* 6:00 montage. A mix of characters doing funny things - will make the kids laugh.<br />* Screen Saver option.<br /><br />DISC 3 (DVD)<br />* Film, plus special features from disc 1. WITH THE EXCEPTION of no Spanish subtitles/language; English only.<br /><br />DISC 4 (Digital Copy).<br />* Code both unlocks the copyand gets you the usual points at the Disney site.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent product no matter how you look at it. The case has that new single hinge, multi-page off center chassis that has proven to be less than durable, but it should suffice for low usage storage.

His world is slowly turned upside down as he plunges ever deeper into the primitive, nature worshipping community only to discover the missing girl is the bait and he is the prey. A paranoid, occult thriller featuring Chrisopher Lee as Lord Summerisle and an au naturelle Britt Ekland.  Directed by Robin Hardy from a masterful screenplay by Anthony Schaffer.<br /><br />It is highly ironic that local churches offer \\"Harvest Festivals\\" in lieu of more disturbing Halloween parties for their youth, when in fact it was the pagan harvest rites that often included blood sacrifices!

B002KDUDG6|4.0|When I received a promotional copy of Michael Buble's \\"Crazy Love\\", I was expecting it to be a pop album.  After listening to it, it was not quite what I expected but still a pleasurable CD to listen to.  Most all the songs are covers of songs by other artists.  There is a wide variety of music on the CD, but many of the songs are from older generations of music.    He has an amazing voice and can tackle all of these songs well.  I am not a big fan of cover songs because I always compare them to the originals or more popular versions; however he does a pretty decent job of making them his own.  The song, \\"Cry Me A River\\" has great instrumentals and sounds like it should be in a movie or theatrical performance.  I also like his original song \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\".    I am an Eagles fan and had a hard time listening to his version of \\"Heartache Tonight\\".  I also feel this CD might appeal more to an older generation who grew up with these songs.  It is not a typical pop album, if that is what you are looking for.  I think this would be a great CD to listen to while having a nice dinner or romantic evening with your significant other.  It is a nice family CD that everyone can listen to and can recognize at least one song from.  It is a very soothing and pleasant CD to listen to.  Overall, I enjoy this CD when I am in the mood for something a little different.  It is great to listen to while relaxing.  I think it is worth checking out!

B001F7MSFW|4.0|PLease note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't speak to the quality of the DVD transfer. But I did want to make a few comments about the movie.<br /><br />I basically watch movies like this for the special effects and the action, not expecting anything much in the way a convincing story, well developed characters, or even good acting. That way I avoid the anguished indignation of the many sci fi or fantasy fans when the sequel fails to live up to their overblown expectations. After all, it's sci fi/fantasy, what did they expect? Last Tango in Paris or Gone with the Wind?<br /><br />Of course, the counter-argument is the movie, Bladerunner, which has everything, but then Bladerunner was based on the Philip K. Dick novel, and Dick was a half-wacked, dyspeptic but brilliant sci-fi writer who was in and out of psychiatric care or even mental hospitals much of his life. Maybe there's a lesson there somewhere when it comes to finding good ideas and move scripts.<br /><br />But anyway, all that aside, I really enjoyed this movie, perhaps because I didn't see the original Hellboy which everyone here is unfavorably comparing this sequel to. But this movie has some of the best action, special effects, spectacular background sets, and fight sequences of any recent super hero movie. The fight between Hellboy and the Golden Army soldiers, who can reassemble themselves sort of like animated Leggos, is cool. The final fight scene in the clockwork-like underground cave is ingenious and suspenseful, and the super kung-fu elf bad guy is like something out of Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon.<br /><br />Overall a pretty exciting action flick that is sort of like Tolkien's Middle Earth meets Lost in Space, since there are some campy sci-fi elements too. I give it a solid 4.5 stars just for its adrenalin pumping action and special effects. Just ignore the sappy love affair and sit back and watch the action. Plus when the ectoplasmic being in the cool looking space suit tells their CIA-clone boss he can \\"**** my ectoplasmic schwanstucker\\" at the end of the movie I just about fell out of my chair.oplasmic schwanstucker\\" at the end of the movie I just about fell out of my chair.
0385341008|2.0|First let me say that I didn't even finish the book.  I read a little over 100 pages and called it quits.  My impression of the book is that the author was fascinated by the German occupation of Guernsey, researched it well, and thought hard about how to present her research to the general reading public.  I think she chose a poor method to achieve this goal.  The writing is very witty at times, but wit alone cannot carry a book successfully to conclusion.  It felt like she had a checklist of the historical research she wanted to convey and that with each successive letter she checked her outline to see what information she wanted to tell us next and then did so through a letter, whether it fit into what little of a plot existed or not.  It became terribly tedious and nothing compelled me to continue reading.

1416583408|2.0|Sadly,  this is one of many, many books that are filled with assertions, not facts. We now have an enormous amount of information about dogs thanks to scientists who decided that  the reason for not studying dogs because they weren't in their \\"natural habitat\\" is incorrect. Living with humans IS a dog's natural habitat. They are, in fact, our first domesticated animal. Trustworthy books on the dog include those by  Vilmos Csanyi, If Dogs Could Talk, or Lindsay, the three volume treatise, the Handbook of Applied Dog Behavior and Training.    But even better is to do your own work understanding your dog. Buy the Brenda Aloff book, Canine Body Language or  the Abrantes book, Encyclopedia of Canine Behavior. Then watch your dog, study your dog, see what he does when presented with various stimuli.     As to horrible mistakes based on, perhaps, just her dog (the fallacy of reasoning from the particular to the general) is Horowitz's  comment on meeting another dog. She's right AND she's wrong. When two dogs meet, they SHOULD be allowed to do the \\"sniff test,\\" etc. on a loose lead. Why? Dogs that are restrained may respond negatively out of what some believe is the \\"frustration\\" of not being able to make a dog-like \\"meet and greet.\\" This is very similar to  fence behavior between two dogs which presents the same difficulties for the dog. Two dogs on opposite sides of the fence often start barking and snapping. When allowed to meet without the fence in between, there is a far more subdued \\"conference.\\" As a member of a rescue group, I have witnessed this over and over and have stopped using the \\"time-tested\\" recommended \\"first have them meet on opposite sides of a fence\\" approach to introducing one dog to another (A far better approach is to find a partner and walk the two dogs together for a mile or so.)    So her recommendation is, on the surface, a good one, loose lead meeting, good. Unfortunately, two completely clueless dog owners (remember, I'm in rescue) can't possibly tell if their dog or the other one is \\"targeting\\" the other dog or just harmlessly anxious to meet this canine passerby. \\"Oh, but my dog/other dog is wagging their tail.\\" Ah, wagging. Here's an example where a little studying of the Abrantes book would pay dividends. Wagging comes in lots of varieties. Is the tail going around madly in circles or is it high and stiff and wagging back and forth slowly like a metronome...it makes a difference. Did one of the dogs avert their eyes? How about the approach? Did one dog attempt to approach the other dog from the side or are they both coming towards one another head to head. And of course there are the tailless Dobies and Rotties, so you need to look at other signals, ears, lips, body language. I don't normally allow my dogs to meet other dogs on the street because there is too much risk and very little reward. If you like to walk your dog on busy streets, teach your dog to \\"heel\\" or \\"on by\\" when meeting another dog. See, for example Koehler or Patricia Burnham.    All in all this book is like most of the mass media junk, sitting on shelves in your favorite book store, either filled with anecdotal information or making statements unsupported by anything other than the uncited \\"study.\\" There are good books on dogs, but  they are far and few between, the McConnell series comes to mind as well as Be the Dog by Duno, The Dog's Mind, by Fogle or the Domestic Dog by Serpell.    But if you have a dog, then you really have the best available information curled up next to you. Just don't draw conclusions based on \\"human logic\\" or what's more accurately called anthropomorphisms.  What I mean, for example, is the call we often get (by the wife) about a recently adopted dog, that the dog is urinating in front of the husband as soon as he walks in the door. And the husband (it's invariably the husband) is sure that the dog is doing it for spite and no matter how loudly he screams at the dog, the dog continues to pee as soon as he walks in the house. Well I am sure most of you know what's going on here. Dogs don't do anything for spite (their range of  emotions are far simpler than ours). The dog is being deferential. It's what dogs do to show submissiveness to a senior, more dominant animal. So we tell the wife to tell the husband to stop screaming at the dog and make believe he actually is happy to see the pup...or feel free to return the dog to us and go out and get a nice stuffed animal    As to this book, unless you're in the book store, sipping a latte while skimming the book (and looked up the reviews via wi-fi...or you're a relative...pass...
B001FB55I0|4.0|I liked this movie a lot, but I enjoy the TV series much more. It is easier to follow the time-travel elements in the TV series over the movie T-4.

B002OVEB5S|3.0|With Slayers long gaps between cd's you'd think there would be more Reign in Blood type of moments but overall this is a medium paced cd for the band. Sure there are a few super fast songs on here but there is a good amount of 'spoken word' singing delivery style from Tom and the tune that repeats \\"die in front of me\\" for the chorus (possibly \\"playing with dolls\\") is easily the slowest & most basic thing Slayer has ever done w/ lots of slow finger tapping on the guitar. Rick Rubin was back again to produce and I'm surprised he let the guys off this easy. I guess the Marilyn Manson type of tours are rubbing off on them tempo wise. Another short clock in time at under 40 mins. Makes you wonder what they do w/ all the years in between and downtime between shows. Personally , I think God Hates Us all has been their best effort as of recently. Christ Illusion and this new one have too many 'phoned in' type of moments for Slayer. Hearing this cd reminds me of the track they did for the Wrestling industry. A bit more mainstrean and accessable. And you know Slayer has changed their ways if they are packaging this cd with a dvd called \\"playing with dolls\\". I guess those Hell Awaits days are long gone. If you are a die-hard then this cd has its moments but there are others i'd put on first.
0553350048|4.0|** This review was for the original listing- the title was \\"Agatha Christie Mystery Collection - Complete set\\".  The items available were not complete sets however.  It appears the listing has been modified (which sellers can do after they list an item) and now only advertises one edition.  I have bumped it up to 4 stars as a result.    There are multiple listings for these books. I recommend buyers search on \\"Christie Mystery Collection Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" to examine them all.    Original Review:     (when this was for \\"whole collection\\"... left here in case it reverts to that again)    The Agatha Christie Mystery Collection as published by Bantam roughly between 1983 - 1988 provided a fine collectible set from the best selling author.  This series made an attractive addition to any fine library, with over 70 volumes.  I am not sure how many were in the total set, I have 65 and have seen others reference 75 or 80.  There were a couple short \\"bonus runs\\" several years later that added a few extra titles so it is hard to say what a total set really is.    These are not currently available in (new) book stores and can only be found via used book stores, online, or private party sales as far as I know.    The books were typically bound well, hardcover in a navy blue (almost black) faux leather padded cover with gilt imprint on the cover and title on the spine.  The end pages (inside of the covers) had an attractive pattern, although some later editions had the pattern marred slightly by mass printing errors.      This specific item listing is not anything like an official one (i.e. listing is NOT made by Amazon).  Buyers should be aware that the sellers likely do not know what a \\"complete set\\" looks like (as little information on the whole collection seems to be available).  I would advise contacting a seller and asking how many books, and which titles, are in the set they are advertising before buying.  Especially if there are no details for their item underComments.  The image shown was likely only the FIRST item listed here and would not match anything currently listed.    The books are fine, I am not reviewing the works of Agatha Christie either.  The vagueness of this listing and the potential for the buyer not getting a \\"complete set\\" as advertised is what generates the low review.      However, it is possible a seller could have a large collection of the books here for sale and that could be of interest to someone wanting a great looking set of matching Agatha Christie books for a display shelf or as the starting point for a collection.    The books are available on Amazon individually also, usually listed as \\"Mystery Collection\\", \\"Bantam blue\\", or \\"leatherette\\" in the title.      Be aware that many copies were purchased by libraries so conditions can vary greatly and buyers who are building a nice collection should exercise due diligence. Some sellers are better about describing their copy than others, as you will see.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|One of those movies that has grown (a significant amount I should say) on me over time, `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is probably, in my personal opinion, the greatest swashbuckling sea adventure film ever filmed.  Now, when I walked out of the theater the first time I saw this I didn't feel that way.<br /><br />I was supper hyped about seeing this (you think I worship Peter Sarsgaard, you should see the shrine I have in my bedroom dedicated to thy Holy Crowe) and so I was there opening night with all this built up enthusiasm and wound up nearly falling asleep and completely giving into my friends constant griping and concluded that this was a dud of a film.  Problem was, I already promised my father that I would see it with him the next day and so I braced myself for boredom (although I do enjoying watching Crowe do anything).  Get this; there in the middle of the day I watched this film through new eyes.<br /><br />I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Now I was already going to buy the film regardless of my feelings (like I said, WORSHIP) but now I had a new outlook and was highly anticipating the DVD release.  While the film is glorious (I've seen it nearly twenty times and am strongly considering watching it this evening...the wife is away for the weekend which always turns into an excuse for me to eat pizza, drink beer and watch every Russell Crowe movie I own...which is all of them) I have to give a major shout-out to the extras here, because this DVD is packed with them and they are all amazing.  This should be noteworthy coming from me, because if you follow my reviews then you know that I never discuss extras because to me the review is all about the content of the film, not the DVD, but these are just too good to ignore.  I don't generally watch the extras but I've seen these a few times and find them thoroughly engaging.<br /><br />Back to the film.<br /><br />I think my issue with the film upon first viewing was that I was expecting something totally different.  I was under the impression that the last fifteen minutes here (briskly paced, non-stop action) was the entire film.  It is not.  It is the last fifteen minutes.  Now, as we all know, I love slow brooding character studies; but not at midnight (yes, I went to the midnight showing).  That was a huge mistake, although had it been a high speed adrenaline rush I don't think it would have been.<br /><br />So, like I said, the biggest issue was that I was expecting something else entirely.<br /><br />Upon subsequent viewings (many, as you can tell), I've come to appreciate this film as so much more than just your average high seas tale.  There is a beautiful honesty about its portrayal of sea life that makes me quiver in appreciation, but there is also a genuine sense of comradeship that really becomes the basis for the film in my opinion.  The chemistry between Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany is utterly fantastic and it really makes this a simmering beauty of a film.  There is a natural elegance with the way Crowe portrays Jack Aubrey's feelings towards his crew, and the awkwardness with which he tells a joke (much like a grandfather at a dinner party, unsure of others reactions but sure in his own `need' to tell it) is completely endearing.  Just witness the way he allows his character to seep into his delivery, making every word seem so natural and almost expected (\\"Name a shrub after me; something prickly and hard to eradicate.\\")  Matching him every step of the way is Bettany who completely soaks his character Stephen in a rich loyalty and constant admiration.  Even when Jack displeases Stephen you can tell he is only displeased because he knows in his heart that Jack can do better.  He believes in him that strongly.  Both performances are utterly stunning and completely deserving of any and all praise.<br /><br />The fact that both were snubbed of Oscar nominations is disgusting, especially when those hammy `Mystic River' men took home the gold.<br /><br />Peter Weir is in top form here, creating such an authentic look at naval life.  I love the way that the creaks from the wood on the boat can be heard in every frame.  There is not a single false note here.  It's remarkable to tell you the truth; totally and completely remarkable.<br /><br />So, knowing what you are in for will surely heighten your appreciation for this modern masterpiece.  It is the best of a genre and more than that, the best in the world that is cinema.  It fleshes out not just the two men who form the focus of the film, but it fleshes out the world that is sea life; the ship itself becoming a major player in this film.authentic look at naval life.

B000001EXR|5.0|If you are considering getting Carnival of Souls, you probably have a lot of KISS's other works and are looking to complete your collection. That being said, should you buy COS? That depends. If you are looking for more party music to cheer you up, well, this isn't the album for you.<br /><br />A lot of people criticize KISS for doing songs that mostly focus on sex and partying, and frankly, that's what they excel at, in a loud, fun and hard rockin' way. I really don't have a problem with that because they are very talented at it, and quite frankly, there are a lot worse topics that a person could sing about.  Most times that I listen to music, I'm looking for an escape from the mundane problems and dramas of reality. So, KISS fills that void for me perfectly.<br /><br />But when I finally got around to buying COS and listened to it, I was floored by how really good it is. Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Eric Singer, and Bruce Kulick really made a touching and beautiful album when they recorded these songs.<br /><br />The playing by all is amazingly good, and the range of singing by Gene, and especially Paul are outstanding. So if you are ready to listen to something more mature and moody from KISS, look no further, this is the album for you.
0385532458|4.0|Just got this book on Nov 4 and I have read 5 of the 7 stories. I find it interesting these were originally meant to be books but the ideas didn't go far enough for the author to continue them as books. Each story in the book is about 40 pages, as the book is only 320 pages long. I finished each of the ones I read in less than an hour. Good change of pace to get a story that takes less than an hour to read instead of a couple of days.
B001FZ6R0Q|3.0|This would be just another saturday matinee kid show had is not been for the high quality 3D and exciting cinematography, Very fun, mindless entertainment with great performances.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|On track 12 of this CD that I received, the song is called A Daily Anthem, it plays OK from the beginning of the track until the time of 4:20, (where this song ends then), and the total length of time of track 12 is listed at 15:24.  Then there is a long area of blank (no sound) space from 4:21 until another song starts up at the 12:00 minute mark and then this new songs plays until the end of the track at 15:24 which finishes track 12 but it's a completely different song, which I don't have a clue what it is, or what it is called.  Does anyone else have this problem with this CD ????  I'm wondering if I got a defective CD and there should be another track listed inbetween these 2 songs, but all I get is like 7 1/2 minutes of blank air time in the middle of track 12.... pretty strange I would say, but I like the CD, nothing against David Cook and his music but I'm not sure why track 12 is goofed up like this.
0316010669|5.0|I get this underlining impression that \\"Blink\\" is designed to help decrease discrimination against black people in America. It seems to be the author's focal point.  Since Obama, this ideal is very popular, and Malcolm is coming in at right time.  Sure, it get's into \\"thin slicing theory\\" but it is heavily armed for negative notions against African Americans from White (Caucasian) people.<br /><br />But then again, the author Malcolm Gladwell is half Black and half White, so this makes sense.<br /><br />It's an easy read, not a trivial subject, and racism is a great starting point to get his ideas across!<br /><br />Peace
B002POVIMS|5.0|I love every track on this album! It is sexy, mysterious, funky, and unique and I can feel the music in my soul. Elly is going to be par with Annie Lennox in my opinion; she is a true artist. La Roux is original and fun and every song is sharp and thoughtfully written. I love the 80's techno vibe and how it is turned into something of the future.
0385341008|5.0|Charming and funny, with a lot of interesting information about the occupation of Guernsey by the Germans during WWII. It even has a happy ending.<br />I hadn't planned on reading this book, so it was a really great surprise.
0385532458|5.0|\\"Ford County\\" is quite simply proof that John Grisham can write. Obviously, he gets a lot of grief from those who dismiss his work as plot-driven fluff. But there is and always was more to his work than that. Writing in the more confined forms of the short story--where intricate plot twists and long-built tension are impossible--Grisham shows us he can be as entertaining with tools such as interesting characters and truths about human nature we can all recognize.    It's also his funniest work. I'm glad he wrote it. Not that it will change the literati's impression of fiction that is meant to entertain an audience (heaven forbid). But I can practically guarantee that, had Grisham used a pen-name for these stories, the critics would have hailed an important new voice in Southern literature. Go figure. Good for you, John.
B000A2RRF4|3.0|This concert video is high quality, with excellent sound and good close-up footage.<br /><br />Michael is such a wonderful dancer and performer. You want to keep your eyes on him at all times.<br /><br />How frustrating, then, to have the camera constantly pull away to show the crowd. Right in the middle of intricate dance steps! What a waste! Sure it conveys excitement, but how many fainting young people do we have to see passed hand over hand through the crowd to the medics? Someone was really misguided here. There are also a lot of cutaways to the other musicians, but at least this makes more sense, and is part of what we want to see - the performance. If I wanted the other, I could look in the mirror and scream Michael and hyperventilate till I passed out.<br /><br />When the camera is on Michael, though, it is worth it.<br /><br />There should be a warning sticker: \\"Excessive FFF\\" (Freakin Fan Footage).
B002OVEB5S|5.0|I havn't been crazy about everything slayer has done since season's in the abyss, but world painted blood is plain awsome.  It sounds like their 80's stuff like \\"R.Blood\\" \\"south of heaven\\" and \\"seasons\\" with a touch of god hates us all and christ illusion.  Great stuff.
B002MW50KO|2.0|Well...let's see...anyone who knows my own work knows that Dylan is the greatest teacher I ever had. No one can match him for what he's accomplished in this life. A Christmas album...First off, all profits are going to feed a lot of people. It's a very generous and kind thing that he and his record company have decided to do. I don't know of many artists who would be so generous. As far as the quality of the work...Dylan sees things his way...and that's the way it should be. It is what it is. I do think it's time for him to be satisfied and happy with all that he's done and enjoy his grandkids. His legacy is intact, and no one can ever take that away. He done good. His voice has gotten rougher and bluesy-er which I happen to like but only with the right material. A Christmas album is not the right material, by any means. But, again, it will feed a lot of hungry people...so with that in mind...go for it. If anything it could be a collector's item. I still have his \\"Little White Wonder\\" albums. What I'd like to see is something to really suit his voice now, which would be an original Blues album. Kick it around Bob. Grab those New Orleans boys again and George to produce.
0385504225|1.0|I try to finish every book I start, even if the book is less then thrilling or even mildly interested, I might skip pages or narratives but I finish it.  This is more then I can say for this book, I had to stop before it drove me completely nuts.  I cannot remember the last book as boring and bland as this one.  There is make-believe uninteresting plot, personality-lacking main characters, people who can't give straight answers, and scenes after scenes of super boring Masonic blabber that does not give any answers to any questions.<br /><br />Anyone who ever read Dan Brown knows that he is not a good writer, so I did not expect him to improve with age.  I know he goes to archives and copied pages of uninteresting tales and puts them in his book as is without editing or even trying to make them more appealing.<br /><br />However, even not expecting anything good, this so-called book was HUGE disappointment.  There was one happy moment in the book when he killed Langdon, I almost started to breath easy, but then he had to come up with crazy story and revived him.<br /><br />This is one truly terrible book, it will kill your vacation if take it to read on vacation, it will kill your weekend if you read it at home, it will make your train ride impossible, and if you listen to it on CD in your car - beware of accidents.  Skip this book; find a better author to read.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|The music is really original and well arranged. This certainly is pop-music of the highest level. But the singer still sounds to me like Bono on helium.
B002J8LVO0|5.0|It was about time this was remastered! I own the MFSL gold cd, and this new version sounds very good, a little brighter than the MFSL, the instruments come out clearer but this also adds a little bit of hiss. The sound levels (no extreme compression/limiting here) give room for the dynamic range to breathe. This album is a classic, the songs flow nicely one into another and now we can enjoy it without having to buy expensive gold remastered cd versions. Cheers!
1594152497|1.0|I am going to tell you what I believe. I believe this is a work of the devil to draw christians away from Jesus Christ. If you notice, the media, and everywhere we go, there are things trying to draw us away from Jesus Christ. Even religious holidays are covered up with nonreligious icons like The Easter bunny, and Santa Clause. THE WORLD IS COMING TO AN END. WE ARE GOING THROUGH A SPIRITUAL WAR. THE DEVIL WANTS US TO BELIEVE THERE IS NO JESUS CHRIST AND THAT HE CAN'T SAVE US AND THAT WE CAN SURVIVE WITHOUT HIM. THIS IS THE DEVIL'S PLAN. ONCE HE HAS YOU WHERE HE WANTS YOU, HE CAN TAKE OVER.    I would like to share you about my experience. I thought I could live not believeing Jesus died for our sins and that he can't save us, but I was mistaken. Good things actually happened to me, but one day I saw a spirit of the devil that was trying to take over my soul. As soon as I asked Jesus to protect me, I was saved. The spirit disappeared and I was alive. LET ME SAY AGAIN, THIS IS A SPIRITUAL WAR WE ARE GOING THROUGH. THE ONLY WAY TO WIN IS TO BELIEVE IN JESUS CHRIST AND THAT'S ALL. ISN'T THAT AMAZING! JESUS PEOPLE ARE NOT SUFFERING. I MAY NOT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BUT I AM DOING FINE AND I AM HAPPY. GOD'S PEOPLE ARE EVERYWHERE TO WARN PEOPLE ABOUT HOW JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS AND HOW WE CAN HAVE LIFE FOREVER WITH HIM. THE WAY TO WIN IN THIS CHRISIS IS TO BELIEVE JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR OUR SINS, AND THAT'S ALL!!! WE ALSO HAVE TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE IN DISBELIEF AND PRAY FOR THEM. IF WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SINNED, WE MUST REPENT, AND THAT'S ALL. ISN'T THAT EASY!!!!!!!!    YES, WE HUMANS ARE SMART, BUT WE STILL NEED TO BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS OUR SAVIOUR AND THAT HE DIED FOR OUR SINS!!!!!!!!!!!PLEASE GET EDUCATED, READ THE BIBLE TOO (ESPECIALLY THE REVELATION SECTION), AND COMPARE NOTES, AND YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH!!!!!!!
0061914177|1.0|I was looking forward to this book when I saw the author on TV.  While reading the book, I kept hoping the gem or central idea would be gleaned; the reason or reasons for the time spent reading would be revealed.  I was sadly disappointed.  The author seems to have little appreciation for what it is that has made him a success (the knowledge of wine and the energy he adds to the promotion of that knowledge).  Social Networking is his venue but there are not a coherent thread to follow in the development of his business strategy that can be said to be revolutionary, unique or even worth the time spent reading this book.  The number of sentences that begin with \\"I\\" is sad as this book is more about the author than the reader.
0786838655|4.0|I purchased this book shortly after its publication in the hopes that my youngest son and I could start reading another series together (we had recently finished the Cirque du Freak series and thoroughly enjoyed it.) As much as we loved \\"Cirque,\\" the Percy Jackson and the Olympian series took us on a journey that neither of us will ever forget. Rick Riordan's seamless weaving of Greek Mythology into a coming of age teen tale made for an engaging, evolving, storyline that readers of all ages could enjoy. The ONLY reason that this particular book got 4 stars is because some of the late book in the series are actually better. I applaud the author and his ability to remain entertaining over the course of an entire series. I highly recommend this book to one and all.
1878424505|5.0|Relevant when he wrote it.  Relevant today.  There is a lot of wisdom in this book if you take it to heart and apply it to your life.  You could read it agaqin and again and get something new out of it each time.
B000002U9W|3.0|I have long wanted to acquire AHM as I have most Pink Floyd though until recently only about half of pre-DSOTM Pink Floyd. I read all the very mixed reviews and decided I'd probably like it, so plunged in. I've got to say I'm disappointed. Maybe its wrong to say there's anything wrong with this recording per se. The challenge I have is that I have a great deal of music to choose from, and by now own almost all Pink Floyd (bar I think, More, and oddly enough the first one).    I therefore have two choices to make: first I have to decided I'm in the mood for Pink Floyd, and secondly, I have to decided which. I've listened to AHM once only, and while I know it's wrong to make a decision on such short acquaintance I honestly don't think I'll be selecting it again in a hurry. I'd have to decided I'd rather listen to this than any of the others in their amazing portfolio - and the reality is all the others are better (some far better and some slightly better). So what chance does it have to see the light of day? It's a little tedious, and the chamber music doesn't appeal to me. It's the sort of thing I might occasionally put on to justify having bought it in the first place, but doesn't warrant intensive listening.    But who knows? It may be one of those recordings that rewards persistence. Only time will tell - if it ever makes it back onto my player.

B002OEBMN4|5.0|For those of us who have been listening to Slayer for these many years, this is their best work in a long time.  I think they really should be given credit for sticking to what works and not trying to reinvent themselves every few years like another band I won't name.  They do it for the fans!!!!!  Tom sounds better than ever and the band is non-stop.  Loved it!!!!
0385504225|2.0|To be honest, I was really excited about this book, like REALLY EXCITED. Not the fact that Dan Brown writes controversial issues, but that he is an entertaining author. However this book I was not very entertained by it. Was it a page-turner? Yes, but that's only out of frustration because like some other reviews have said, this book goes no where for most of it! No one ever bothers to explain anything, and Robert Langdon is plain annoying. He wasn't like this in A&D and Da Vinci Code! He goes through most of the book rebutting everyone else's statements. \\"Yes I've heard of it but it's not possible\\" was probably said once on every page.... until the last one I guess. The story just became so predictable after a while. Dan Brown seemed like he tried way to hard and then fell flat.    anyway, read it if you like to read, don't if you expect something great. I hope his next book featuring Robert Langdon will be better. I mean come on this guy found the Holy Grail and yet in the Lost Symbol he didn't believe most of the claims throughout the novel. AH frustrating read to say the least...
1592289444|4.0|As I was reading my mind had a hard time believing.  Then I read it might not be true...that would make more sense.  What a story teller!

0061914177|5.0|This is a fun, easy, quick read. And damn entertaining. But don't let that fool you. It's also packed with valuable information that, if used, could change everything about your life.     Like Gary, Crush It, is genuine, intelligent, sometimes brash and always brutally honest. What it never is: apologetic. Gary, in his straight forward, no BS style tells it like it is. He not only details his own journey from obscurity to celebrity, but also makes the case that it's possible for any of us. And, then shows HOW to do it. Imagine that.     Essentially, Gary's supposition is that these unprecedented times translate to huge opportunity for anyone willing to grab it. Instant communication, the thirst for and access to knowledge/information, as well as the fewer than 6 degrees of separation that stand between us, have leveled the playing field, and that field is now ground zero for a whole new game. Gary looks at examples of real life people/companies who are playing this new game and how they are playing it. He analyzes what's worth your time and what's not in the realm of social media. He talks strategy, offers straight-up advice and dissects what's necessary to most effectively navigate this new world. It's all great stuff, but...    this book is not just about social media. The subtext throughout is something much more basic and vastly more personal. Gary's deeper message is this: you can equip yourself with endless social media tools and be savvy enough to use them, but they are of little help if you don't possess passion and the desire to work harder than you ever have to pursue it.     This is not new information. And Gary knows that. What is new, as Gary artfully details, is the ability to channel that passion in this new frontier, to be able to leverage the personal brand you can now build through social media and create a life that you're so excited about, you never want to go to sleep.     The information, the writing style and the message of Crush It! are solid, yet I can see some people reading it and thinking,\\"Huh? What the hell is this guy talking about?\\" And, in my opinion, those cases are not a reflection of the quality of content, but rather a reflection of the challenge the book presents to the reader. This book is intelligent, thoughtful and practical, and what will most determine if this book speaks to you, is your mind set when you purchase it. Like anything else, you have to be willing to not only hear what Gary has to say, but to do something about it. This book will not \\"change your life\\" if you don't execute. Gary lays down the gauntlet (albeit wrapped in layers of motivation, inspiration & encouragement): Forget where you are now, what you think limits you and what you do/don't know, what matters most is this-are you willing to \\"work your face off\\" for your passion? Because THAT is what it is going to take to crush it.
0385504225|1.0|After reading Dan Brown's latest, The Lost Symbol, I described it to a friend as one of the most boring books that I have ever read. I realize that is harsh, but when the book is put forth as a thriller, there is no better description. While I didn't consider either The Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons as great literature, I enjoyed both for their entertainment value. This book left me completely cold in that regard. By the end, I was so tired of lectures and dissertations about symbols that I truly didn't care about what happened to any of the characters. The true action in the book ended many chapters before the final one, making them rather superfluous. I just wanted it to be over so I could close the cover and be done. This is not my usual experience with reading and certainly not with any book I regard as decent. For those who enjoyed Dan Brown's earlier bestsellers, forget this one!
B002TNMKNQ|5.0|The singer's voice is the definition of powerful.  This edition of Florence and the Machine's debut album is a two disc version.  The first CD is the same as the single disc you will see in stores.<br />The second disc is a DVD full of goodies.  It has music videos(full version, not just extracts) for \\"Dog Days Are Over\\", \\"Drumming Song\\", and \\"Kiss With A Fist\\".  Next, it contains videos of live performances of these three songs, performed by Florence and the Machine at the Rivoli Ballroom.  The singer provides short introductions to each performance, which are pretty entertaining.  Watching these makes you wish you were a part of the audience.  :)<br />So if you can find this edition, definitely grab it!  :D
B002OEBMN4|5.0|for one, myself being a longtime slayer fan and love of true thrash this is a great kick ass album. the band finally stepped out of the overly produced recordinds previously that came out. for todays generation this is what real metal sounds like. not that im dismissing or trashing slayers last albums witch were great,i think this is a return for what they do best. something they haven't done in long time. pure,gritty,in your face, live sounding. a sound and artform that has been lost through the age's. i think alot of older band,s from that time evenually gave in to todays overly produced fake sounding bulls***. this is a bold move for slayer, and i hope they can pave the way for other bands to come back and show that this is what its all about. kikin ass and playing somethin thats worth listening to and sounds good. somethin that sounds real.all you kids today, take a lesson, listen to this album and and hear some true metal vetrans rip it up.

B000MV8AE0|2.0|Well well. I saw this and felt like laughing. Repeatedly. Though not at the same time the rest of the audience did. No, my compatriots were all believers in art, who accept that a great artist can be vulgar (laugh when he dropped his drawers), brutish (laugh when he destroyed the model), oblivious (laugh when he poured water on his neighbors, over and over....), and demeaning (laugh at his insults to all around him, and even those not around him.) This movie was targeted at the Oprah crowd, for whom women have been always oppressed, mushy banalities count as deep thoughts, self-indulgent narcissistic artists are more essential than the bores who design bridges and build computer networks, and greatness (however defined) trumps all other scales. (See: Polanski, Roman)<br /><br />No, I laughed when Ana and Louie locked eyes during the ludicrous conducting. She was wagging her arm as if she were saying \\"Bye-bye\\" to a reluctant four year old going to a party. This was just silly. And interminable. I laughed when the deaf maestro could hear her soft spoken words but couldn't hear thundering applause. I laughed when Anna walked off into the field at the end. I felt sure that she was going to be wearing a habit at the end of the film; how else to explain that no one has heard of her? But their ending was even sillier.<br /><br />I could go on, but why? A dumb film. With some dumb dialog, dumb anachronisms, and doubly dumb performances, it was a one star film. However, I do commend the film-makers for allowing Anna to keep her clothes on! One small detail done right; combined with some lovely, if stagy, cinematography, that's worth a half star. Another half for the (glorious, if chopped) music. But nothing anyone ever needs to see!
B000PC0U1W|5.0|With the feel of the graphic novel the film looks fantastic and has a story to match. I have watched it 5 times and it feels fresh! 5.1 sound is strong in dolbyhd as pic looks great. Review and screening on the 5th of November on Sony Denon Energy
B002R2K6LC|5.0|Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe, Norway's new millennial Simon & Garfunkel are back, issuing a DECLARATION OF DEPENDENCE five life- and world-altering years after RIOT ON AN EMPTY STREET.<br /><br />This time around, Kings of Convenience are Feist-less but lyrically feisty. DECLARATION OF DEPENDENCE is an album that seems open to interpretation on at least three different levels - personal, artistic, and global.<br /><br />In addition to the album's title, songs such \\"Rule My World,\\" \\"Freedom and Its Owner,\\" \\"Peacetime Resistance\\" and \\"Scars on Land\\" suggest that the Kings have been thinking much about a world dominated by a single global superpower.  If so, they sound less than impressed. \\"Only someone who's morally superior/can possibly and honestly deserve/to rule my world.\\"<br /><br />At the same time, maybe these are just metaphors to reinforce the fact that love remains a battlefield, as in songs such as \\"Mrs Cold\\" and \\"Me In You.\\"<br /><br />\\"Boat Behind\\" could be about two lost lovers or two childhood friends getting back to work together: \\"So we meet again after several years... of separation/Moving on moving around/Did we spend this time chasing the other's tail?\\"<br /><br />As with [[ASIN:B000056MYN Quiet Is the New Loud]] and [[ASIN:B00026W82U Riot on an Empty Street]], this new album is gentle, catchy, and packed with songs that are real \\"growers.\\"  Played low, it's delightful background music.  Louder or through headphones, its lyrical punch is clearer, with sad-wise lyrics giving a melancholy edge to its summery sound.<br /><br />Ultimately, however you interpret these songs, Kings of Convenience recognize the simple truth that in today's globally connected, interdependent world, actions have consequences.  And relationships matter.
1596434252|5.0|This book provides wonderful examples of the creative things that can be done with pop-up books. As an art student, this book has been invaluable in finding new ways to approach paper-construction assignments. Each letter provides a new surprise!<br /> I would recommend sharing it with everyone, but leaving it in the care of children is probably not the best idea.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Not-so-hot on the heels of ANGELS & DEMONS and THE DA VINCI CODE, Dan Brown dumps his symbologist hero Robert Langdon into the Washington DC-based, Masonic-ritual exposing THE LOST SYMBOL.<br /><br />Of course, there are plenty of suspenseful... ellipses!  And Langdon reacts with over-the-top fear and wonderment to the run-of-the-mill discoveries he makes along the way.  But still, this feels more like a tired Hollywood sequel than a committed attempt to rise to new heights.<br /><br />While the characters, Langdon and heroine Katherine Solomon are frequently puzzled and bewildered, regular thriller readers are likely to be less surprised at how things unfold. Villain Mal'akh provides the lunacy and gore.  But the final revelations THE LOST SYMBOL ultimately uncovers are a huge... letdown.
B00009L1TA|4.0|Can't say that any of the actors in this were allowed to do their best; but, despite this, the film was entertaining, if not first rate. Travolta often seemed to be acting at acting in the role of a Department of Drug Enforcement agent called in to try to untangle a messed up Ranger exercise in which a number of recruits and their training sergeant had been killed. The objective was interrogation of the two survivors. Jackson is the over the top brutal training sergeant who is seen in flashbacks as the questioning elicited conflicting stories of his death. He played the part to the hilt. Nielsen as the official interrogator is pretty convincing. There are times when the film seems  to lose momentum but soon gets back on track with some bit of action. All-in-all,  the 100 minutes will pass quickly and leave a good taste behind.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I always enjoyed Michael's music through the years, but I never really understood that the man was a genius until I saw this movie. It really allowed me to see the behind the scenes creative process involved with his music and dance, and to get a sense of how much went in to his shows and each and every song. He put his entire self into the performance, and he clearly had an unbelievable gift. This movie really allowed me to get a glimpse of his genius at work.<br /><br />I would definitely enjoy seeing many of the numbers in the movie again. I noticed somewhere that one reviewer didn't like the film because Michael wasn't singing at his full ability for some of the movie. Yes he was saving his voice for his tour. However even when he was using a small percentage vocally of what he had, it was  fantastic, and I was totally entertained. There were moments when he really broke out and put his all into it, and it was amazing.<br /><br />The movie also gave you a good look at some of what would have been seen on his concert tour, such as the music videos that were to accompany the stage performers. They were simply fantastic. Michael had spared no expense and as always with him, there was some ground breaking stuff.<br /><br />Of course you can't help but feel some sadness that his life was cut short as it was. Regardless, I'd totally recommend this video.
B00005JLWN|5.0|One of my favorite. Easily in my top five, and one of the most underrated movies of all time. Great actors who really sell the role (Christian Bale should have won something for his part), along with a great story that makes you think, but leaves with a nice resolution. Granted, the action does force you to put your logic on hold for a second...but I really don't have a beef with that. So long as the characters actions and abilities have been explained prior to those actions being fleshed out on the screen (ala the Gun Karta training, which explains WHY he can stand in the center of a circle of bad thugs and still take them down) then I'm okay with it.<br /><br />It was this movie that made me want to read 1984. Does a lot better job at the whole \\"government control\\" theme than V for Vendetta ever did.<br /><br />The theme of the movie is brilliant, and Kurt Wimmer does a great job of showing why humans must feel, even if that leads to bad choices down the road.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|Probably the most rereplayable of the Die Hards, the latest effort in the long running series delivers on exactly what everyone expects:  A typical guy movie that contains lots of explosions, lots of action, and a certain trademarked cowboy euphamism.  I wouldn't necessarily consider this the best Die Hard movie (Die Hard 3 clearly takes that title) but Live Free Die Hard delivers a modern twist that allows plot lines to become more... explosive and believable.  Granted believability really isn't the goal in a Die Hard movie.  There is certainly ample occurances where you will have to be quite forgiving in how the movie bends the laws of physics.  However, it brings about a decent (and most applicable) plot line, decent acting and lots, and lots of amazing action sequences that leaves you pining for the next step up in your surround system, and only hoping that you can fly a car into a helicopter, and destroy a plane with your bare hands when you are passing into your 50's.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|This doesn't get released till November 10th, 2009. But, I just saw it in theaters (it was in very select theaters on Nov. 5, 8pm). It's every bit as good as I hoped it would be. I was lucky enough to be near a theater that played this just a few hours ago, there were only 8 in the whole state of California that was playing this. Visuals were amazing, and the sound was superb. It's not easy to fill a place like Royal Albert Hall with as much intensity, energy and passion as the Killers have done. The stage was attractive and familiar if you've been to a Killers show. The shots were well filmed and the sound capture was good as well. I can't wait to get this and play the **** of my surround system.<br /><br />Update:<br />Received it in the mail the day the DVD/Bluray was released. Way to go Amazon!<br />My rating of 5/5 remains unchanged. This release is every bit deserving of 5 stars. I know it isn't clear on the Amazon page, but the Blu-ray version does NOT come with a CD. The DVD version does. However, that is more of Amazon's fault for not listing correctly, so I disagree with the reviewers who let this affect their review of the Bluray. Product reviews should pertain only to the product, IMO.<br /><br />This Blu-ray is great because the concert itself was great. The Killers are probably one of the best live bands in the world today. This movie release brings the Killers concert experience into the home very, very well. The energy from the band is amazing and Brandon Flowers is left gasping for air at some points.<br /><br />Just buy it, you will not regret it.
B001OB2CF0|1.0|I agree with others who've called this a huge disappointment compared to earlier Cars albums. Let's start with the title -- how much dreck oozes from a title like \\"Heartbeat City\\"? And the lyrics? \\"Summer, summer, summer, summer, it turns me upside down\\"? Like it was written by a 6 y.o. And the sound is just generic synth. I think the reviewer who suggested that they were older and just not that into it anymore probably hit the nail on the head; I think there's probably more energy and a hint of desperation in a band's earlier works that goes out the window when they've made it and aren't dependent on the next gig to make rent. Anyway, this album can't hold a candle to Cars or Candy-O.

0786868724|5.0|I first heard about Mitch Albom's writing from my wife. She has a soft spot for happy-go-lucky, optimistic, sometimes sappy stories, and I hastily--to my shame--assumed Albom fit in those categories. Somewhere along the way, I decided to give one of his books a chance. \\"It's so short,\\" I figured, \\"that it won't hurt to give it a try.\\" Which was really my way of saying, \\"to cross him off my reading list, once and for all.\\"<br /><br />Years later, Albom is one of those at the top of my list, and \\"Have a Little Faith\\" is another example of the reasons why. Albom stitches together the very different, yet faithfully similar, stories of a Jewish rabbi and a former-drug-addict-turned-inner-city-pastor. As he prepares to give the rabbi's eulogy, he begins tracing the man's past, his toils and sorrows, his secrets of marriage, and his open-armed view of the world. He also struggles with his own judgments of this inner-city preacher with the big belly and criminal past. Both rabbi and preacher have something to teach him--and us. Both men are examples of faith and Godly wisdom purified through sufferings in this world.<br /><br />As always, Albom employs a concise, almost winsome style that still manages to touch upon the honest hurt and anguish of human existence. He doesn't duck the difficult questions. He offers up answers that rarely seem trite. And, in the midst of the uncertainties, he tells a story that offers a little faith, hope, and love for all of us on this same earthly journey.<br /><br />Am I an Albom fan? You betcha. Thanks to my wife's patient nudging, I look forward to each of his books, and I can truly say that I'm ashamed no more.
0316044938|3.0|I just finished the book. When I bought the book, the girl at the cashier said (as she bagged my order which included this book), she said - Oh wow, Lovely Bones, that is such a good book. I quote. I felt excited about reading it. I am always intrigued to read books about authors perspective of what heaven is like, since I miss my mom so much. Either I missed some details because I read the book post op from my elbow surgery, or the book just simply had a very anti climatic ending. I don't the murderer was ever proven or charged or discovered as the murderer, and I am not sure why the book was titled Lovely Bones. On the positive note, the author makes excellent use of words, I like the word selection and flow. But was disappointed otherwise
B002NXSRW0|3.0|The main problem with G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA?  It's not a G.I. JOE movie.  At all.  Somewhere along the way, the studio probably decided (correctly, it seems) that they could tack the G.I. JOE label on this baby and make a few extra bucks.  This story line could be told with any characters, and it would still make no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />Let's face it: you don't watch films like this for the story, the plot, the acting, the dialogue, or anything that you would watch a decent movie for.  You watch it for cheesy lines, lots of action...basically something to watch while eating nachos and drinking beer.  And, on that level, God help us all, THE RISE OF COBRA works.<br /><br />I won't bother rehashing the plot; there isn't one.  There's a whole lot of miscasting--Marlon Wayans? Really?--and way, way too many flashbacks; we don't care about Snake-Eyes's past, we only care about how much a** he kicks in the present (and, thanks to Ray Parks, he kicks a lot).  There's too much back story between Duke (Channing Tatum, as reliably wooden as always) and the Baroness (Sienna Miller, slumming it hardcore), and eventually a showdown between Duke, Cobra-to-be Rex (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and Destro-to-be McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) involving who loves the Baroness the most (did I just ruin things?).  Yeah, even for an action-and-no-brains flick, it's far-fetched.  And don't get me started on the excelerator suits.<br /><br />But there's something to be said for actors who know they're making a horrible movie.  Gordon-Levitt is a pure and under delight, hamming it up almost as much as he did in (a far superior film) KILLSHOT; Eccleston is pure and utter camp, as is Dennis Quaid as the leader of the Joes.  We also get cameos from Sommers mainstays Brendan Fraser and Kevin J. O'Connor, and you know you're watching crap when you think to yourself: \\"This film could use more Brendan Fraser.\\"  Fraser's MUMMY nemesis Arnold Vosloo is grossly under-used as Zartan, Cobra's shape-shifting wild card, as is Jonathan Pryce as the U.S. president.  Ultimately, we are left with a movie that means little or nothing to those of us who grew up with G.I. JOE, but is still valuable as mindless action schlock that appeals as a 2-hour distraction from reality.d, as is Jonathan Pryce as the U.S. president.

9113020730|5.0|This is the third book in what is now a trilogy of novels centered around the character Lisbeth Salander. Salander is unique -- a deeply flawed but also incredibly resourceful individual who will fascinate you. This book begins where the previous volume (The Girl Who Played With Fire) ends, with Salander brought to the emergency room of a hospital in Goteborg, Sweden, with three bullet wounds, including one in her head. One of the persons who tried to murder her later comes into the same hospital into a room two doors from Salander, bearing grievous wounds that Salander herself inflicted.<br /><br />You will have to read the first two volumes of the trilogy to understand the storyline in this volume. That should be no problem, because the first two volumes were hard to put down. This third volume is the longest in the series, but it reads even faster than the first two. The first half of this volume sets up a situation involving legal charges against Salander that seem irrefutable, especially as police and prosecutorial resources are marshaled against her. Because of the charges against her, Salander is locked into her hospital room with no access to a computer and only very restricted access to information from outside. This lead-in creates tremendous tension, as the reader is allowed to look into the careful measures that Salander's friends and foes are taking to prepare for a courtroom denoument.<br /><br />If you have already read the first two volumes in this trilogy, you will not need any coaxing to buy this third volume. It contains much less explicit descriptions of sexual behaviors than the second volume contained -- all to the good in my view. I found it to be the most exciting of the three volumes. It is rumored that a fourth volume in the series exists, but it is in need of editing and may also be locked up a long time in litigation regarding the deceased author's estate. Whether a fifth or sixth volume exist in outline form is anyone's guess, but we are unlikely to see anything beyond a fourth volume anytime soon, and even getting at the fourth volume in our lifetime may be a stretch. All of which is to say, get this book and enjoy it. It may be the last we ever see of Lisbeth Salander.ee anything beyond a fourth volume anytime soon, and even getting at the fourth volume in our lifetime may be a stretch. All of which is to say, get this book and enjoy it. It may be the last we ever see of Lisbeth Salander.
1416955070|1.0|...as in, \\"Why is this book so popular??????\\".<br /><br />I'm currently on page 145 of 486, and I am not sure if I want to continue. I am a YRCA completist, I have read Mistik Lake, Deadline, Twisted, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian (both of the ones I've mentioned are soon to get a review). But how on earth did this garbage get a YRCA nom???<br /><br />NOTHING exciting, with the exception of Jace stabbing a demon, has happened so far. THis is one of those books that you drift off while reading. I can not believe how boring it is so far!!!!<br /><br />Clary Frey (I tried so hard to pretend that name isn't cliche, unfortunately I failed) is such an annoying character and a total Mary Sue. Her mother has announced that she wants to spend the summer at a farmhouse, and yet Clary acts all bitchy because she had all these parties she wants to go to and these art classes that are apparently \\"interesting\\". Boo hoo hoo, wah wah wah. Basically the only character thus far I like at all is Jace, he seems like a cool guy (yet another cliche name! Yay!).<br /><br />The writing is so poor I don't even know if I can take any more. \\"He stabbed a demon in the neck and blood fountained on his boot\\". FOUNTAINED???? Excuse me????????? Am I on drugs or did I just read the word \\"fountained\\"??? And if you're trying to make it as in a Kill Bill context, couldn't you just get better grammar and say \\"a fountain of blood sprayed on his boot\\"? IF you thought that was bad, there's more.<br /><br />Sorry, Cassandra Clare, but you did not make a fan out of me.
B001PR0YDA|5.0|This animated adaptation of Charles Dickens', \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" could well become the classic film version to 21st century kids as the Alistair Sims \\"Scrooge\\" became in the 1950s.  The animation is so 19th century authentic that it actually is continually illustrating the Victorian classic book.  It is true to the Dickens words and spirit.  From the beginning it is a visual-experiencing of olde London.  All that is missing is the smell of coal smoke and horse dung.<br /><br />It is not just Jim Carrey (Scrooge, 3 ghosts, & more) and Gary Oldman (Cratchit, Marley, Tiny Tim) that so passionately do the unforgettable characters' voices. Colin Firth, a necessary for any top quality Victorian London story, as Ebenezer's nephew Fred's voice, is animated to look the most like himself.<br /><br />Animated sets are thrilling and punctuated with moments like sliding down hilly iced-over cobblestone back streets, the coal soot patina on 1840s shops, and animated London fog looking more atmospheric than the real thing. Scrooge's bony fingers are as true-to-life as on an emaciated elderly man near death. Scrooge is himself a bit ghostly; like a more aged Lemony Snicket. And about as darkly evil.<br />____(Excuse the name dropping, but with any great film--it is bound to be compared to other accomplishments.) Like the aerial flight through time where Scrooge is hand-held by a ghost.  It recalls images of Mary Martin in \\"Peter Pan.\\"<br /><br />The 2nd 'Scottish' Spirit's home was a Victorian Christmas visual masterpiece of delight; and the trip through Christmas Present, more like floating with \\"Mary Poppins.\\"  Spirit of the Future's trip adventure, however, depicted more peril than anything \\"Indiana Jones\\" ever encountered. Action! Misadventure! Fear!<br /><br />This film is technically animated beyond \\"Polar Express.\\"  Characters' hair, snow & ice, and the Cratchit Christmas goose are all as aesthetically fine and real as any photography.<br /><br />The only negative for this adaptation to Dickens' Christmas Spirits' story is the inability to push a \\"play\\" button on a remote for a second viewing. I can't wait for a DVD version (next year?). For now, it's back to the box office.<br /><br />IT'S A CLASSIC-both book and film.  Don't do this Christmas without seeing it.  It's perfect for our economic times: the underlying theme that Christmas is about giving and family.  Take your family (as long as the kids are beyond 2nd grade).

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been exercising on and off for years either at the gym or on my own.  I did some cutbacks recently and gave up a few of my favorite things, among them my membership to Equinox, a 'state-of-the-art' gym.  I decided to go ahead and buy some DVD's to workout at home.  Since Jillian Michaels is 'the trainer of the moment', I bought her DVD's.  Well, what a big surprise!  Level One was tougher than I imagined.  In this particular one she only uses light weights and the rest is just using the body.  I consider myself an intermediate level and found it a bit challenging.  Push ups, jumping jacks, and so on.  She is just as tough on the DVD as in the TV show 'The Biggest Loser'.  If you lack motivation I guarantee you will get it from her.      If you never ever exercised before, this DVD is not for you.  My recommendation is to review it first before actually doing it to know exactly what you will be doing and prepare mentally for it.  I love it because I am driven and determined to do everything she says to get quick results.  My motivation?  Admiring the way she looks.  If you just concentrate at her core while actually doing the exercises and envision yourself looking that toned, cut and buff, that is enough there to make you keep going.  I highly recommended. I actually own the two other DVD's and they are just as good.    Definitely not for the weak of mind.

B001YYQ9SS|3.0|I have seen this movie like a 1000 times, it is beautifully made, if not a bit confusing plot wise (I have played the game like 1000 times too, so my confusion is not for lack of understanding of the FFVII universe)     But this is not what this review is about. I am reviewing the BluRay and lack of respect to us fans. I got the BluRay today and was VERY disappointed to find out the Zack animated short is not included AGAIN! I thought this thing would have EVERYTHING. If Transformers' 2 BluRay can have 6 hours of special features... well.  Instead we only get the new Danzel short and a disappointingly short list of the same stuff we got on the DVD... no Zack short though, to me this feels like an excuse to squeeze more money out of us.     I previously bough the two disc DVD, in which of course, since there was a SPECIAL \\"Limited Edition Collector Set\\" whatever they call it, edition coming out at some point (which sold/sales for $49.99) wasn't included either. It was only reserved for those who forked out the cash. I thought, that by now, SquareEnix know that they got just about all they can from the DVD sales, so they should have included BOTH shorts in the BluRay plus whatever other incredible footage and revised scenes they claim to have, is not lack of space (neither was on the DVD) is just pure disregard for the fans who follow them even though they are the KINGS of delays and overrated hype. It disappoints me to see whoever decides what was to be included in the special features (or not), holding out on us fans like this. What, are they going to release a BluRay special edition with some fancy cover and charge $100 bucks for it just to get a 20 minute short film!?  Do they really expect us to buy every release they put out there? I Guess I should just buy the most expensive one and shut up, but that is not the point.     I rate this a 3 because the movie is enjoyable and you do get the 1080p HD experience, but that's it, there is hardly any new special features, so there is very litle point to buy it if you have the DVD. I say save your money, or buy another BluRay you don't have...like Transformers 2 lol.
0439023483|5.0|This book was a great read!  I was told by quite a few people to read it, and I was hesitant at first, having heard how violent and gory it was and it's sci-fi. I'm not into sci-fi.  And yes, it is a bit violent and not so bloody, and sci-fi.  And it wasn't that bad......and I could not put it down!!!  It's the first sci-fi book I've been able to read all the way through and completely enjoy!<br />The characters are strong, the story is strong and it's an intense and engaging page turner!<br />I started out rooting for Katniss, but in the end more of my concern was for Peeta and I don't care for Gale at all.  I'm not sure I want Peeta and Katniss to be together.  I almost feel that Katniss doesn't deserve him.  I don't want Katniss to be with Gale.  I'm not sure I think that Katniss should be with anyone.  I guess we'll see how that all turns out.<br />I finished it in two days and immediately went out and bought the second book 'Catching Fire'!<br />I'm not sure I agree with the reading age of grade 7 and up....but I'm not sure.  It's definitely for a more 'mature' reader.<br /><br />Rumor is it's becoming a movie, script penned by Ms. Collins herself!  I will definitely be seeing it when it happens!<br />And if you're looking for a intense read, I very much recommend this book!!

1416594787|2.0|Presumably, Mr. Dawkins set out to write another book on evolution because he believes a significant percentage of the general public doesn't know the underlying basis for the theory of evolution. He suggests these people are creationists in denial.    What's wrong with Dawkins' book---To begin with, he doesn't give us a good perspective on evolutionary biology. For example, if fossils in the Cambrian period required millions of years to evolve why is there an absence of their ancestors in the Precambrian period? Why is there a lack of certainty about the evolution of birds?  Why do different molecules have different rates of evolutionary change?     Creationists believe that the world was created by God. They do not necessarily dismiss evolution. Creationists believe that parallel evolution, extreme specialization, mosaic evolution, molecular evolution and other evolutionary characteristics are plausible, though not completely understood.    As physicist Freeman Dyson said, in some sense it seems as if the universe knew that we were coming. I doubt that Richard Dawkins would agree.    This is the second Dawkins' book I have read. I wish that I had not.
0385340575|4.0|When I was perusing my local bookstore for literary entertainment, my attention was seized by the opening discussion on the \\"12 signs\\" for identifying a potential terrorist and went home with this novel.  The story took me on a rip roaring adventure & fulfilled my desire for escapist edge of your seat thrills and danger which was what I was looking for.  I recommend this to anyone who's looking for outrageous action/adventure fun.
0786838655|5.0|This book is amazing. It is a very action packed book about the Greek gods which covers everything, from satyr to Madussa. This book is a very fun read which pulls you in - It makes you read more and more. The main character is a twelve-year old boy named Percy Jackson. Percy has dyslexia which causes him to see words in a different way than us. Since Percy has dyslexia and for other reasons that I will not dislcose (for fear of giving the secrets away), he has gotten kicked out of many boarding schools. Also Percy is what they call a \\"Half Blood.\\" Read the book and you will find out more about Percy Jackson's exciting quests.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|This movie was fun and enjoyable if you have little knowledge of Star Trek like a lot of die hards do. While I do consider myself one of those die hard fans, I enjoyed the movie for the sheer fun of seeing Trek with a new generation of actors and special FX technology. I have to agree with a lot of reviewers about the storyline being relatively weak. I think the whole time travel line was pretty much played out with Star Trek: Enterprise. I might have missed something during the movie while choking on some raisinettes or something, but the one thing that really bothered me about the story was could someone tell me how a Romulan in charge of a Mining ship of all things get the gear to make it travel through time? I would still recommend this to anyone and I definitely want to buy it on Blu-ray. The quality of Blu ray is better than seeing it in theatres!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I'm 34 years old, have enjoyed The Beatles since I was a teenager in the late 80s, and would describe myself as an audiophile, but not too crazy. In the last couple years, I got into Vinyle LPs and generally find good examples of Vinyl LPs to be better sounding than CDs of the same content, often even better sounding than DVD-A's or SACDs.    Anyway, a part of my Vinyl collection of which I'm most proud is The Beatles Collection vinyl LPs from MFSL (Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs) in flawless condition. They're the best-sounding recordings of The Beatles I've ever heard, far and away richer, fuller, more powerful, and more nuanced than the original 1980s CDs. Recorded from the original (stereo) master tapes, they're great. But like the 1980s CDs, they're all stereo, and as you've probably heard, a lot of the earlier Beatles albums have pretty crummy, contrived stereo, with voices and instruments often panned severally to one side or the other, like a gimmick.    Enter the new Mono remasters. I ordered them on the strength of earlier reviews, and I'm not disappointed. First, the quality of the sound, generally, is much closer to the nuanced, less edgy detail of the Vinyl MFSL records. But most surprisingly, in most cases, the mono MIXES usually are more satisfying. Moreover, they are incredible in the way they don't sound like what I imaged Mono would sound like. That is, they still have a compelling sound stage or image.    I had assumed that only the earliest Beatles records would sound good in Mono, but I was happily surprised at how even later albums like The White Album and Sgt. Peppers sound better on many tracks in these Mono mixes than in the Stereo mixes. The best way to describe it is that they have more impact, oomph, presence. Excellent examples of this include Glass Onion on The White Album; the stereo mix sounds a little like it's in a can or cave. The Mono mix simply kicks ass and rocks with deep, impactful bass. On earlier albums like Help!, \\"Yesterday\\" is far better in mono (as are just about all the simpler, acoustic ballads), because the simplicity of the guitar and Paul's voice are much more out front instead of artificially panned to one side or the other.    You won't be disappointed with this box set.
B002LBKDYE|5.0|I just watched this film and all i can say is WOW. Everyone in this country needs to see this film. I am a 50 year old woman and i watch the news and read the paper daily and never have I seen something that effects the lives of so  many. I am gong to buy a few copies and tell people to watch and then pass it on.   What is wrong with the FDA and all those in charge of our food, that they would allow this to go on. I for one will never eat another tyson or purdue chicken. I will make an effort today to find an organic grower in my area.   We have to start voting with our pocketbook, and we have to stand up and say I am not going to take this anymore. Watch this film, eye opening.
1416550534|5.0|It gives me great pride as a fellow Aussie to review this engrossing, atmospheric historical novel from Queenslander Kate Morton. A great story well told, this book ticks all the boxes - well crafted characters, finely detailed plot with a delicious mystery to solve, grandeur and elegant settings. Moves seamlessly between past and present as the story of Grace and the goings on at Riverton are told in slow-burning sublime style.     Terrific stuff all around. Buy it. Read it. Enjoy.    (Note - first published as \\"The Shifting Fog\\")
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I think someone said in their review.  \\"This not your fathers Star Trek.\\"<br />While the movie had good action scenes and the acting was ok, it was not Star Trek as everyone remembers it. Perhaps it should have been called \\"Star Trek, the alternate time line\\", and should have had different characters.  When I saw the advertising for this movie, I though it was about the James T. Kirk we all know.  A story about his younger days at Star Fleet Academy and his early<br />assignments.  The other characters , Zulu, Chekhov and Uhura<br />were much younger than Kirk in the original series.  Yet they<br />seem to be about the same age in this movie. The producers tried<br />to get people in the theater by adding Leonard Nimoy to the cast.<br />He did not fit in this movie.  And it looked like someone dug Spock up from his grave to appear.<br />This is not Star Trek as the old trekkies know it. If they cannot come up with more voyages of the original Star Trek Enterprise 1701 and its sister ships 1701A, B, C, D and E as we know it. Then they should let sleeping dogs lie.<br />I feel this will go the way of the remakes of other great movies,<br />(Wild, Wild West, King Kong, Mighty Joe Young, Zorro, The Jazz Singer, The Time Machine and many others) down the tubes.
0545123267|5.0|I knew after the first seven pages, I was hooked. I loved how Sam and Grace's relationship was something that grew through the years, so that once they met, it felt real. Sometimes I get annoyed, when all the books I read have the protagonist fall in love out of nowhere (not that it couldn't happen, but you'd think feeling that strongly about someone would take a little time). I really felt like they could have been so in love, just from watching one another from afar...<br /><br />Out of all the werewolf stories I've read, this is without a doubt my favorite one. The ideas in it make sense, the characters are perfect for the story, and it was all very original. I never felt like I knew how it would end (I just knew how I wanted it to end!). Grace's obsession with the wolves was a little odd to me, but I guess my obsession with books is a little odd to others, so I can't fault her for it. Sam was a sweet, adorable guy, and I couldn't help but to love him. I loved the minor characters, especially Olivia and Isabel (who grew on me eventually). In all, a fantastic novel, and I really need to see about checking out some Maggie Stiefvator's books at the library. If they are anything like Shiver, then I have found a new author to keep an eye on.<br /><br />Highlights: The minor characters definitely brought more to the story. They were fun, crazy, scary, and everything in between. Plus, I wasn't expecting to love this novel, I thought I just might like it. But I loved it.<br /><br />Lowlights: Grace's family really disappointed me, but I thought they were highly realistic. Some people have parents like that, who never notice anything, and it's sad.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I'm a REALLY BIG Led Zepplin fan. First time I bought the LP and CD with Song Remains the Same is around 1992 and they are crashed up for a long time ago, because they have been in action so many times.  So yes of cause I have it on DVD and CD now.   I see myself as a grown up man, but I must say I have sometimes still been close to crying like a baby when I listen or worst hehe see Since I've Been Loving You on DVD. And I have many times been flipping out in the middle of Dazed Of Confused and No Quarter. When it comes to this kind of music this is the BEST, you can get, THAT'S IT!
1595141979|5.0|Let me quote myself: \\"Does 'Oh, my, gosh' cover it?\\"<br /><br />This novel was truly fantastic. The plot was so much better in this novel than the last, and we really got some more insight on what it truly means to be Shadow Kissed. I thought Rose really grew up in the last book, and I was so wrong. She grew in this one. First, she doesn't get Lissa as a part of her field experience, then she starts seeing ghosts. Can life suck any worse? The end fight scene was entertaining, and kept me on my toes. This series is a definite must read.<br /><br />Highlights: Dimitri + Rose = Awesomeness. Seriously, how long was I waiting for that? I also loved how Mead wrapped together all of these events, and had me going \\"it makes sense...\\"<br /><br />Without a doubt, my favorite part was the very end, with Rose and Lissa. Weird, I know, but it was. I was thrilled that Rose finally thought of herself, and not everyone else.<br /><br />Lowlights: The part that bugged me the most? Towards the end, one of the casualties in the fight. If you read it, then you know what I'm talking about. WHY?!? Now I'm dying to read Blood Promise...
0385532458|5.0|John Grisham has nailed his characters - I read with a smile pasted across my face as I recognized familiar events unfolding written with just the right sincerity. Shades of Faulkner's \\"The Reivers\\" in \\"Blood Drive\\"  - John's crusade with this book seems to be only to have fun. He must have drunk from the same well as Eudora Welty who also knew how to write with a twinkle in her eye. A book of priceless stories that would make a great gift for guy or gal.
1401323820|3.0|I enjoy the TV show Castle, which is why I bought this book. However, for me, this book falls short of the show. (Rare, since I prefer reading to TV.)<br /><br />The dialogue is much like the TV show. The characters banter and there is a lot of lighthearted fun in the way they speak to one another. However, the story lacked detail. The plot was a spin on various episodes of the show. At times it was more like reading a summary of events.<br /><br />The characters also lacked detail. If I had never watched the show, I doubt I would have had a clear grasp of the characters. Heat came off a little too needy (in a drippy, drooly, school girl crush kind of way) and Rook (Castle in the show) came off a little too childish.<br /><br />The book is short (196 pages) and doesn't require a big committment. It's easy to read, light, and a good distraction from life. Overall, good but far from great.
1576754227|2.0|While this book does have some interesting ideas, none of them is very well developed. If you feel like you need to be more productive, this book will only make you feel guilty, with suggestions like \\"if this isn't the most important thing in your life, why are you wasting your time on it?\\" The author says in the introduction that he got where he is in life by asking successful people about their productivity habits, then emulating them, and this comes through in the book: it reads like a collection of his notes from those conversations. If you've never read a productivity book before, this might be an interesting whirl-wind introduction, but really, why waste your time on it?
0743277465|2.0|I almost always love the books I buy, it is rare that I pick a book and read it and then have it turn out a disappointment. Josh Waitzkin's book is a book that picked with high hopes, and it turned out to be a dud. I enjoyed his lectures on Chessmaster, and liked \\"Searching for Bobby Fisher\\" the movie about his chess career. Bases on this movie and chess program, I was certain that the book would be good, but it was not.<br /><br />Much of it is taken up with detailed descriptions of his recent \\"Push Hands\\" competitions, which I had to skip as they bored me stiff, and the \\"lessons\\" he gleaned from them I found to be nothing that I cold use in my life. I understood from other reviews that the title is a misnomer, and that this book is a biography more-or-less. This did not put me off, as I was interested in the reason why he quit chess, and whether he would ever take up the game again. Regrettably these questions were explained unsatisfactorily,  too cursory. There were a few mildly interesting pages, but they were few. I could not finish his book!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Without a doubt Tarrantion's best movie since Pulp Fiction. Absolutely stunning cinematography, dialog, acting. Keep in mind there is LOTS of long drawn out scenes with LOTS of dialog, but this just adds to the tension. Amazing movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout DVD!  I bought this DVD not expecting much out of it, just something to keep me somewhat in shape as I just wasn't making it to the gym as much as before due to a job change.  Let me tell you that I sweat more in 20 minutes than I ever did in 45 minutes working out at the gym.  Save yourself the money you're spending for a gym membership and buy Jillian's DVDs!  You will definitely get your money's worth!  I also have Jillian's Burn Fat and Boost Metabolism DVD and am getting ready to purchase her No More Trouble Zones.  I do get a little bored doing the same thing over and over again, so I plan on mixing up the 3 DVDs during the week.  I don't know if I've lost any pounds, but I definitely feel stronger and more toned.  So if I lose inches and not pounds, works for me!  The fact that you get so much out of 20 minutes is great too.  I am a mother of a 6 and 2 year old, I have a full time job and I'm in school so I need a workout that is effective and doesn't require too much time out my day.  Thanks Jillian!
0312330537|5.0|I often wonder why people take so much time and energy to write these reviews; especially the negative ones. This is my first time and it's because I just loved this book and I want people to know it. It's great when an author speaks to you and you can't wait to get back to the place where you can be with the book again. I mean it's a 900 page book and there were only a few pages that dragged for me. That's amazing. What a journey. As I read in bed next my girlfriend, it was as if I was in Bombay.  She was sitting in bed in Tucson while I was having adventures in Bombay in the Slum or at Leopold's CAfe, or...<br /><br />Loved the way he writes; it's so personal and real. It was a little weird that wherever he was somebody was looking for him.  But, he is a very charismatic man. Thank you for writing this book. In my humble opinion, it is indeed a masterpiece.
B000J10EQU|2.0|Superman Returns: 4 out of 10: This movie is definitely missing the spark that made the first two Supermans fun. (Superman 3 was pretty awful and Superman 4 is one of the worst films of all time). Superman comes across as a bit of a jerk and a bully in this film and the franchise is not all that better for it.    Superman has gone away for five years in a plot contrivance that threatens to sink the film before it can begin. The claim is that he is seeking the remains of his home world (Not to sound like a comic book geek, but he if gets his powers from our yellow sun one would think he shouldn't be flying past Pluto let alone halfway across the galaxy.) He comes back, sort of says hi to mom, tortures his poor loyal dog with a tennis ball and heads to the big city where he stalks his ex-girlfriend Lois whom he did not even tell he was leaving and who has clearly gone on with her life.    I'm not exaggerating the stalking. Superman hangs outsider her house using superpowers to snoop like some DC comics version of a cautionary Lifetime movie.    Lex Luthor is also back with another stupid plan though Kevin Spacey does play the character well and a talented Parker Posey fills both the Otis and Mrs. Teschmacher shoes.    Both leads (Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth) have zero chemistry with each other and considering they were passionate lovers, their conversations are pretty stunted and mundane.    The action sequences are decent but the whole film seems to drag at two and a half hours and there is a distinct lack of joy. (You know something fun like everyone putting his or her Kryptonite up on E-bay, or Superman dating a supermodel to make Lois jealous that kind of thing, everyone seems so damn melancholy.) Speaking of melancholy, I noticed that Superman never asked about any disasters he didn't prevent while he was on his so-called vacation. Maybe a trip over lower Metropolis to see Ground Zero would have given him a reason for all the moping.
B00006JSS8|3.0|Sound quality is good, but inevitably need to be supplemented with other CD's... Too many tracks are under the table!
B001W79MB8|4.0|Well, this is a pretty good anime flick...  not as good as Akira or Princess Mononoke, but still a good anime nonetheless.  Some scenes can get a little longer than they need to be but isn't that the case with all anime movies? :)  I give this a 4 out of 5.  If you are an anime fan you will enjoy this movie, but there is nothing new or mind-blowing.
B002OVEB5S|2.0|I have purchased the last three Slayer albums, and they just keep getting worse.  I am not a die hard Slayer fan, rather just a heavy metal fan.  Old Slayer was full of infectious grooves that make you feel like your driving 120 mph.  I usually judge music by its melody and its power.  There has been no melody to Slayers music for quite some time.  The rhythm guitars are tuned way out in the production on this particular album, therefore there is no power.  Before listening to the album, I read the lyrics.  Seriously guys, how old are you?  The lyrics get more perverse and more religion challenging as Slayer gets older.  I felt dirty after reading them.  I expect war and horror with a Slayer record and a little ode to Satan, but this is just over the edge stuff (Beauty Through Order and Psychopathy Red especially- rape related). There are also MANY instances of infant and child slaughter here. If this stuff was history related, maybe it would be passable, But this is just what is on these guys' minds.  One thing I know for sure- at this rate, Slayer is going to hell.  They are probably atheists and don't believe in hell, but how do you think you got here? Just a random collection of atoms caused by a big exploding ball?  Everything required to live just happened to appear as well?  How did the big ball from the big bang get here?  Whatever religion you follow, there is a beginning and an end to everything.  Stop tempting fate guys- grow up and write some real music, or hang it up.  Stop trying to shock everyone by pimping yourself out for the money by writing the most offensive lyrics you can think of.  Oh yeah, Hate Worldwide is the best song here but that isn't saying much.
0439023491|5.0|After reading the Hunger Games I intantly took out my laptop, typed 'Hunger Games Sequel' into my Google toolbar, and read that 'Catching Fire' was not due for another five months. NOOO!!<br /><br />I preordered 'Catching Fire' and got it the day it came out. Less than a week later I finished an was blown away by the action-paced, suspenseful, and definetly worth-the-wait novel.<br /><br />***A couple spoilers***<br /><br />The story of Katniss continues, as she must face the wrath of the Capitol after the suicide stunt and 'rebellion' she displayed during the last Hunger Games. Katniss is forced to feign absolute love for Peeta, so the Capitol can keep the pretense that \\"we still rule over you, those two didn't rebel, they were crazy in love\\".<br /><br />Although Katniss begins to have feelings for Gale, her once platonic friend, and they share a first kiss. To be honest I switched back and forth between who I wanted Katniss to be with and now I would be happy with either or neither.<br /><br />The brunt of the action in this book takes place in the second half, when the still alive winners of the Hunger Games are redrawn and put into the Quarter Quell.<br /><br />***spoilers end***<br /><br />Although I had trouble getting through the first part the second payed off and I loved the twist at the end. Overall I thought the book gave us a truthful view throught the eyes of a somewhat cynical girl (but really who can blame her), and made me anticipate book 3.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|Michael Buble's Crazy Love is a great CD to just listen to.  No bells, no whistles, just Michael's wonderful rich voice, beautiful instrumental arrangements and classic covers that will have you hummibg along from the time you push play.  Just plain great.
B002NOAF9W|4.0|I agree with what's written here. They should have edited a complete show into the DVD. Granted, filming large rock shows was pretty new, and most likely they had to change film reels and all that during some songs, but they could have spliced in some audience footage to fill it rather than slow mo stuff which we saw on Gimme Shelter. It sounds good but there is a big difference in the 5 bonus songs, as they are remixed, and a bit louder, which made it difficult to create my own correctly sequenced full 15 songs album. I wished they would have done it for me!! Still working on the audience blends, not wanting to loose any of it. I may grab some extra Jagger patter from the Gimme Shelter film to fill in as well. When I have too much time on my hands :-)
B002OEBMN4|5.0|You know when this CD first came out this week i almost was discouraged by the first person that reviewed this CD. I bought it and to my suprise this is one of Slayer's best. \\"a solid effort?\\" are you frickin kidding me!?! This belongs aside Reign in Blood, South of Heaven and Seasons in the Abyss. Its that good!! The interplay between Lombardo, Hanneman and King is now what it was when ol Dave left. This is a masterpiece in my book and has gotten a ton or replay in my CD player. You would think after 20+ years that would sound tired because of such a demanding genre but they sound as fresh as they did when they first starting out. The guitar work is amazing and the drumming is very aggressive and tight. If you are a fan of Slayer this is a must for any fan. BUY IT NOW!! Ive been listening to metal for almost 24 years now and this work reminds of my very first experience with metal which was South of Heaven. Now to see this live will be the icing on the cake. Did i mention....BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!
B0029MAXO0|5.0|I am a huge fan of Keith Urban, I would say he is one of my favorite artists of all time. I would HIGHLY recommend this record to anyone who is a fan of Keith Urban, even if you aren't, after listening to this album, you will be!    This album is fantastic, it has highs and lows and takes you on a journey that only Keith Urban can provide. The guitar riffs are amazing and the words speak to you in that special way.    If you're not a fan of Keith, be sure to pick up this album and listen to it.

B0015QT78O|5.0|I so enjoyed this show in the 80s and enjoyed it all over again when it ran on the SciFi channel a few years back. I've looked for this on video and DVD in every possible place I can think of to no avail. How many people need to request this before it becomes available?     The premise of this show is very sweet and endearing. It showed an innocence that is sorely lacking in today's current line-ups. My favorite is the Christmas episode where Paul's mom's boyfriend tells him, \\"You're a better son than Paul Forrester ever was.\\" (It always makes me cry.) Another favorite is one where an officer tells Paul to put his hands on the vehicle and spread 'em. Paul proceeds to place his hand on the vehicle and then quickly spreads his fingers apart, obviously hoping that was what the officer meant. How could you not fall in love with a show like that?
B000MAH5O2|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed reading this book.  It has really given me great insight into this very inspiring leader.  When you read this book you will realize he is much, much more than a great speaker.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I don't have much I can add that hasn't already been said.  While I prefer a lot of the mixes in stereo, there is no beating this box set for historical value alone.  I think \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" sound horrible in mono.. as if there are pillows in front of the speakers..  But that is how they were back then and this set is merely to replicate that.  The differences between the mono and stereo mixes are very interesting and the first four albums that were already released in mono on CD in the late 80s sound better here.  It is great to be able to buy legit copys of \\"Revolver,\\" \\"Pepper\\" and \\"the White Album\\" in mono.  And the \\"Mono Masters\\" 2-disc set is another holy grail in itself as these are the original 60s mixes that jumped out of car radio speakers way back when.  Never before available officially on CD until now.  This package is a dream come true for fans that have long awaited such treatment to be given to these mixes.  Thankfully Apple did it right!
0756405890|5.0|There are lots of books were the protagonist is ultra-human. Whether it be Heinlein's Uber Mensch or Doyle's \\"Sherlock Holmes\\", the classical Achilles, or a Manga vampire-like creature, literature (good and bad) is full of them. What really separates the Good books and Bad books that have such people is whether the protagonist pulls a solution out of his rear end, or whether we've been methodically led to each achievement, ready and primed for him/her to do their 'stuff'.<br /><br />Kvothe's story, in Rothfuss' \\"Name of the Wind\\", falls into the latter category. Kvothe is a character that can do many things well, but none of them can come as a surprise or as unbelievable if you've been paying the least bit of attention to the story. Rothfuss brilliantly prepares the reader to understand how each feat was achieved. And honestly, it's been a long while since I have read a book that was so well conceived and derived. It is simply brilliantly micro-managed.<br /><br />Now, some of you might be looking at the book size and thing 'egads' that's a lot of words. Let me tell you that the book is a quick read. I mean, I'm as slow as molasses when it comes to words per minute, and I finished it in a few days.<br /><br />The story is told as a memoir, but the book doesn't start at that point. It starts in it's own 'present' and then for it's own reasons goes into the flashback. When I first read the 'present' chapter I was somewhat discouraged, and thought that in all likelihood, what I had in my hands was an average sort of book. But that was not the case. So if you find yourself in a similar frame of mind, do continue on.<br /><br />Talking Points:::<br />Excellent World Building<br />Very Good Writing<br />Excellent Plotting<br />Interesting characters<br />One of THE Best Books I've read this year<br /><br />Be forewarned that the book does not cover Kvothe's entire life. I have written the publisher, but they had no clue as to when-where-how a sequel would appear. They referred me to the author's own webpage. So I, and a very large number of other people, await a new work more than eagerly.<br /><br />Pam T~number of other people, await a new work more than eagerly.    Pam T~
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I was so upset to have missed his concert in Los Angeles, as it could be his last: he last toured 15 years ago, but this DVD is the closest thing to seeing him live.  I don't tire of watching it.  Beside his legendary talent, he demonstrates great class in his interaction with the audience.  What's not to love?
B000EGFVQS|2.0|This book arrived with the jacket torn, writing and stickers on it and dog-earred. I was expecting it to come as described in 'good' condition. This was not so.
0810983915|4.0|My son got interested in this series from other kids at school.  When I agreed he could have his first copy, I had no idea what I was in for.  I learned to look at the book from an amused kid perspective than rather that of a strict parent.  There are funny things in these books...you just have to make sure your child understands and respects that. My kids school library had ordered 2 copies of this.  It's so popular that is has 37 holds on it.  went ahead and bought to more copies and gifted them to the school.  The librarian was so grateful!
B00003CXAA|5.0|Everything was as it should be.  The box set was in excellent condition and the DVD's were in perfect shape.  Thanks loads, this made my husband very happy.
B000056BOR|5.0|i like this movie because it's just funny.  rock hudson and doris day are great together in a movie about how the neighbors share a party line. it you want so laughs, try this oldie but a goodie.
076532413X|3.0|I picked up this book because I like the TV show so much that I wanted to learn more. There are major differences between the two, mainly that the flashforward in the book is 20 years in the future, while the flashforward in the TV show is only 6 months. I think 6 months makes the story more compelling, and has a more immediate effect on the characters and the choices they start making.<br /><br />While the book centered on scientists and explained the scientific cause of the flashforward, I prefer the FBI agents on the show not knowing the cause. I have to admit that all of the scientific explanations bogged the story down and I skimmed over those pages.<br /><br />Gave this a 3 out of 5 rating as it's a great premise and I enjoyed it, but it was a little on the dry side and I could have done without all of the science. Not a must read, but just okay.

B002PEP4SC|3.0|I love the TV show but the book, not so much. Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) is absolutely charming as a wealthy, pampered, self centered but likable character. Jameson Rook in the book, to me, came across as an immature fraternity brat and was utterly charmless. I found him thoroughly unpleasant.    If this is going to be a series, the hot(less) sex scene after such a short acquaintance (kind of like an obligation to page 105), dulls all the possible tension in this relationship for future Nikki Heat books if any are planned.     The plot and writing style were quite okay. It was a fun read most of the time, but I wish they had canned the immediate consummation of what really is a very unromantic relationship and make Jameson, whose name sounds sophisticated which he isn't, at least likable. I liked team Roach and Nikki herself.    I wonder who wrote this...in the poker game I have seen James Patterson, Stephen Cannell and Michael Connolly with bit parts. One of them maybe? Maybe it is joint endeavor.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|When I saw the first trailer for this movie it reminded me of The Good Son, which was an excellent movie. There is just something about demented children that creeps the heck out of me. I went into this movie with a little reservation expecting it to be a poor entry into the psycho-kid genre, but thankfully I was wrong.  This movie exceeded my expectations in every way and gave me hope that they can actually make a great thriller with a little bit horror mixed in. My only beef with the movie is the first twenty to thirty minutes which could have easily been condensed, but once Isabelle Fuhrman's Esther is introduced the rollercoaster begins and keeps you enthralled and sweaty-palmed all the way to the end. Isabelle Fuhrman came way out of left field with her performance as Esther. Her Russian accent is top notch (I actually thought she was Russian in real life). Fuhrman is extremely convincing as she switches personas from the kind, sweet Esther and the evil, sadistic Esther. She plays it well, almost too well. I haven't seen her in anything else, but she seems more experienced that all of the child actors out there.    The TWIST at the end will leave you speechless. Buy it. Rent it. Just see it any way you can. You really won't be disappointed unless you have REALLY high expectations. If nothing else simpy see it for Isabelle Fuhrman's performance.
B001PR0YDA|3.0|I saw A Christmas Carol today at the new IMAX theater at the local AMC 24. While the screen was a little smaller than the IMAX theater I went to in the past, the less confined seating was much more relaxing and picture quality seemed to be even better. Seeing this in digital 3-D is the only way to go. This story has been told a million times before and while it's still a great one, I felt a little bored at times. I miss the days when Robert Zemeckis made films with real actors on the screen, not just the animated versions of them. I will admit that it has come a long way since The Polar Express, but those eyes still have a creepy dead look to them. Jim Carrey is very restrained, especially for him, and made a Scrooge to remember. He also plays The Ghost of Christmas Past and Present. This film is way too scary for kids. I know if I was little and saw this, I wouldn't sleep for nights. It's weird that they released this just one week after Halloween, but if you want to get in the Christmas spirit way too early, this is a very faithful adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic.
B002M9WW30|1.0|Do NOT EVER EVER order early from Amazon.com.  You are foolish if you do.  In most cases, Amazon will lower the price just days following the release of the item.  Those who have previously ordered at a higher price are shafted.  This item is a perfect example.  They first listed it at $ 64.99 and then it lowered to $ 52.99.  Now it is $ 49.99.  All those people who ordered at the higher prices, do not get the lower price, even though they probably still have not yet received the item.  Most would agree that this is dishonest.  To put a stop to this, we should all agree that when this happens we return the items that Amazon overcharged us for.  Maybe then Amazon would stop these games.  I have decided to buy only from vendors who sell on Amazon but not from Amazon.com.  Never again.
B002OB9KPE|2.0|I had high hopes that Pete and Roine hadn't yet fallen under the Neal Morse spell (Mike Portney had years ago)....but I was wrong, very wrong. At the very first listen, I had this strange urge to find some very uncomfortable clothes and sit in a pew. No doubt the $$ I shelled out for this regurgitation of Morse sermon's has found it's way to a collection plate somewhere....very likely so Neal's Pastor can buy a new BMW.  About 6 years back, when Spocks Beard did the Snow album, it was revealed that Neal Morse had found God (or something to that effect), who had apparently been hiding in the basement....and so Neal quit Spocks Beard and began to churn out solo albums saturated with cries of \\"forgive me\\" and \\"help me\\"..it seems that finding the \\"Creator\\" can be very painful indeed. In fact to listen to Mr Morse, one would think that finding religion is a very painful process and makes your life quite miserable. His voice and music became more and more despondent and he sounded in need of a truly good bowel movement to purge whatever is eating him up inside....but sadly, he never did. Now he has brought back 2 very talented musicians to join his quest for the Grand Enema. The result....to a T...is 4 very talented musicians contributing to the Neal Morse Formula. Listen to any of his 4 or 5 past solo albums and there you have it, he does the same thing over and over again ad nauseum....and we keep falling for it! Well Neal....cudos to you, you got my money again! Will I ever learn?  Maybe I'll see you in church...  Or better yet, for all of us, in the mens room.  Time for me to go dance with the Creator....to my knees I go....

B00004W5A6|5.0|I was reluctant to pick this up because it's stereo and not a 5.1 mix.  I have quite a few DSD titles and I've never really been blow away, definitely can be better than the standard release but this is the first title that really just blew me away and made me a believer in the potential for DSD stereo, if it appears, done right.  So if you're a fan and have the equipment to play this then it is definitely worth picking up, of course at a reasonable price.  Bit of surface noise, which you would expect but I didn't find it a problem.  The crispness of the instruments is amazing...  truely excellent 24 bit stereo sound!  If only other titles were as sweet as this....
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Comic books have better plots and dialogue for crissakes. Dan Brown is way off on this one. Purely done for the money.
B002RSDW80|5.0|A friend of mine who was an actor once told me that he thought the hardest part to play was someone either living or within living memory.  With the coming of the internet and YOUTUBE age, that's likely to become a more common problem, but no less daunting.      And Ms. Streep pulls it off with a performance so good it was like Julia Child breathed again in all of her good-hearted, iconoclastic glory.    Honestly, overall, I did not care for the film too much, and I could have cared less for the other actors in the film. That's just my opinion, and other reviewers have written about them in glowing terms, so perhaps I missed the bus somewhere and may have to rethink that position one day. Also, there have been some serious complaints that the Master Chef (I am unsure of the formal title) of the Cordon Bleu was depicted in a way that made her look like a far more snobbish and dreadful person than she actually was.  Nevertheless, it is absolutely worth it just to watch the scenes with Ms. Streep.  It's one of her best performances yet, and that's saying something.  She takes a so-so movie and a so-so script and makes them sparkle as the legendary gourmet who tried to make everyone's life a little happier through those most basic and delicious media - good, hearty unpretentious food, good company, and good cheer.  Just an amazing performance, and were she alive, I will just bet Julia Child would have been the first one on her feet cheering and clapping.           I note with a smile that the one thing you will not want to do is watch this movie on an empty stomach!      Recommend!
B0000073BG|4.0|I was so glad that Amazon had this CD!  It was an import and expensive but well worth it!  I couldn't find it anywhere else!  I am really enjoying the CD; I had it only on vinyl record before and now can listen to it in my iPod or Apple computer whenever I want.      If you like the 70's progressive-rock group Renaissance, you'll love this album.
0765350386|5.0|the book takes a long time to set up and i set it down a time or two thinking it was just not gonna do it for me. wow am i glad i hung in there. this book had one of the most amazing endings i have read in a while and mr sanderson has earned my utmost respect. i had gone ahead and bought the whole trilogy and was beginning to think i had wasted my money. now i have the whole set in hand so i can dive right in without having to wait or go looking for the other books. it has been a long time since a writer has made me feel so satisfied once the book was over.i will be reading on a college football saturday and that is some of the highest praise i can give mr sanderson.

B002NXSRX4|5.0|When I was a kid, just like any other boy my age, I watched my fair share of GI Joe episodes.  However, what really captivated me at that age were the unbelievably awesome action figures and toy sets that accompanied the franchise.  I can remember cracking open the Sears catalog and dreaming about the new vehicles and huge weapons that were released as accessories to the figures; knowing full well that I could never convince my mother to buy me any of them.  I once managed to score some parachutes for my Joes and began a tireless quest to find just the right height from which to drop them.  I settled on the balcony of an apartment building.  Imagine my dismay when I discovered that the toys didn't actually float down like real parachutes.    That is what this movie accomplishes in silly popcorn sort of way.  It's the imagination of young kids everywhere who dream(ed) of how awesome these vehicles and weapons would be in real life.  And that's how I watched this movie:  Constantly anticipating the next ridiculously awesome piece of advanced technology that the filmmakers had thought up.  And it's all here.  Jet packs, fully armed snowmobiles, submarines that maneuver like fighter planes, awesome pulse rifles that take out five guys at a time.... etc... etc.    I could really care less about who Scarlett falls in love with in the cartoon or the comic book.  I could care less that The Baroness in the film is nowhere near as cool as she was in the original cartoon.  This movie hits all the points that really mattered to me as someone who grew up loving this stuff.      It's all about the tech, man.  It's all about guns and ninjas.  And ninjas with guns.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|On September 9th, I went to Best Buy to buy the Beatles remasters. After a race to the new release rack, the one mono box perched on the top shelf was ripped from my eager grasp by a twenty-something who beat me by a second, all the time realizing that he was in no way a true Beatle fan, but an ebayer looking for a quick buck....Drats... Would have to settle for the stereo set and went home half pleased with my purchase, just happy that I would be able to hear this new release... Being a beatle freak since the early 70's, I have bought multiple copies of Beatle vinyl, cassettes, 45's, imports, bootlegs, etc... over the years. So when I started playing the stereo cd's, I was mostly thrilled at what I was hearing. Pepper, Abbey Road, The White Album, just fantastic. Really sonically wonderful... There was that annoying stereo separation with the vocals on one side, and the instrumentation on the other, but oooh so clear and modern sounding. At this same time, I also placed my order for the mono box. Well, about a week ago, the postman didn't have to ring twice. He left the box at the front door, and when I ripped it open, my heart began to race. Beautifully constructed, mini versions of the vinyl I had so missed for years. Great booklet, sturdy, box, all the inserts, plastic and paper sleeves, really nice! Now, for the really good part. THE SOUND. I consider myself to have a very discerning musical ear. I have been a musician and recording artist for 30 years, and know how to critically listen to music while enjoying it at the same time. The first thing I was struck by was the prominent place that Ringos drums had in the mono mixes. Once relegated to distant mud, his fills are now a vibrant, driving force in all the Beatles songs. This, along with a very rich, deep, bass sound, reveal a top notch rhythm section that really drove these songs in a way the stereo mixes can't. Also, the vocals do not have the added reverb that is attached to the stereo versions which allow them to sit on top of the music, instead of making them sound in the distance.... The mono mix also allow the songs to be very balanced and concise musical statements, more cohesive than the stereo mixes, more like a performance instead of a record. The stunning urgency revealed in rockers like Ticket To Ride, Slow Down, Day Tripper, and Paperback Writer, to name but a few, make a full, warm, sonic statment that blow the doors off the stereo masters. PPM, WTB, Mono Masters, Rubber Soul,and Revolver, all bring this home in spades. Songs like Yes It Is, This Boy, Yesterday, etc... are so warm and intimate, vocally stunning. I have not listened to the whole box yet, but find myself totally engrossed in the Beatles music listening to these mono mixes. Great dynamics, thanks to no limiting, and truly a representaion of what John, Paul, George, and Ringo wanted you to hear all those years ago. A masterpiece!

B002M5E2DW|1.0|Make no mistake about it this is yet another \\"self-help\\" book. It is trying to pose as something mystical but there is nothing mystical about it, just a few peoples philosophy on how to live life. Now that fact on its own is not bad (several self-help books really do help people live better lives) but the content in this book presents -- what I believe to be an incorrect(even destructive) way to look at life. It suggest you always look to what you want to become in the future, and that by doing this you will create your future. But in reality only one person can win the gold medal, and if you spend all your time focusing on it, not only will not be able to enjoy the moments leading up to it, but if you do not win it all that anticipation will destroy you inside. A much better philosophy on life is found in \\"The way of the peacful warrior\\" I strongly suggest reading that instead.
B000ZEE3I6|1.0|Where to begin, where to begin? Well, I guess I'll tell you that there will be spoilers in this review and that this is coming from someone who has read this book over 5 times. Well, I guess I'll start with my reasons for hating this abomination.Nothing in this movie matches up to the book except for SOME of the most basic parts of the plot. They couldn't even put in some of the basic parts of the plot to this movie. I didn't expect an exact replica on the big screen, and I did tone down my expectations after the mess that was Phoenix. However, I did expect to see a Harry Potter movie. Not a teen romance with Malfoy randomly throwing a bird into his magic closet at random intervals. The character's had no emotion whatsoever. In the book, the students and staff are beside themselves crying because of Dumbledore dying. In the movie, they all look at his body with a straight face and shoot some magic light in the air.     If I remember correctly, the book had something at the end... hm... I remember it was the most exciting part... maybe, a fight? Yeah, there was a gigantic battle right after Dumbledore died, as I recall. What I DON'T recall is the deatheaters blowing up the school right underneath the bedrooms and classes, and just calmly walking out the door. I also remember a funeral scene vaguely, where the entire plot was set up for the next book including a wedding. Oh, wait one minute! I forgot. In the movies Fenrir Greyback is a human, Ron's brother Bill doesn't exist to be turned into a werewolf or get married, and the Weasly's home BURNED DOWN. Basically, they have destroyed the end of the movie to the point that the next movie is un-doable.     The entire movie is a crappy teen romantic comedy set in the wizard world. I remember that there was some romance in the book, there was the half blood prince plot, about three or four more flashbacks, an actual explanation of the horcruxes as opposed to dumbledore's \\"horcruxes are pieces of a soul in a random piece of crap\\" explanation in the movie, there was some of theDursley's, there was some stuff about Sirius, and there was some business with the Order of the Phoenix. Yeah, instead we get, \\"I love you more Harry\\" \\"No I love YOU more Ginny\\" and so on with other random characters. I wanted to walk out earlier than halfway through, but was waiting for the battle that never happened. I definitely think that Dobby deserved an appearance after getting cut out of his appearances in 4 and 5, and considering what happens in Hallows.    The acting was pretty mediocre. Rupert Grint was good as Ron with what he was given. Emma Watson was boring as Hermionie. Daniel Radcliffe needs to learn that there's more emotions than pissed off and dead serious. Michael Gambon epically fails as Dumbledore again (Who saw that one coming?), and the rest of the cast was pretty bland.    I felt no emotions other than pure disappointment and boredom coming out of this movie. I felt like an old rag when I came out and that mood lasted for a little while. I nearly laughed at how ridiculous Dumbledore looked falling off the tower in slow motion, and overall felt drained at the end.     Overall, the movie would be a complete waste of time to see, and a waste of money to bother paying for. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  I would give it less than zero stars if it was possible, and never plan on going anywhere near this abomination ever again. I don't know if I want to bother with Hallows at this point if this clown is going to be directing it. Well, that's all folks.

My wife, a fellow Trekker (or Trekkie, if you prefer), had no interest at all in seeing the film. It was not going to be the Kirk, Spock and McCoy she grew up with. Why should she care? Well, I convinced her to come with me to the movie and we both loved it. She was amazed that they actually pulled it off! Can't wait to watch this again on blu-ray!

I own several of Dylan's albums, but many are just compilations which don't include the overlooked songs on this CD.<br /><br />Some of my favorites:<br /><br />'Talkin' New York' is an outstanding song chronicling Dylan's impression of the city.<br />'Gospel Plow' has an amazing harmonica piece all throughout it.<br />'House of the Rising Sun' - I had always only heard 'the Animals' cover of this song, so it was nice to hear Dylan's take on it.<br /><br />I downloaded the CD to my computer and started listening to it and found the sound quality was excellent. I recommend this album to any Dylan fan or anyone who loves music period.<br /><br />5/5

1881273156|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of TWO friends who thought it would help me understand and explain some recent dating miscommunication and other assorted shenanigans, and wow... it did help.     It had never occurred to me that other people expressed their affection in ways I didn't. I always sought verbal validation, quality time, quality conversation... that's me. If I'm not getting that, I feel like you aren't into me, you don't like me, you aren't interested in what I have to say, etc. Other things are nice add-ons, but at my core, this is what I need to feel loved.     It also made me realize what a lot of the dysfunction in my previous marriage was. I've started categorizing everyone in my life by how they feel appreciated and cared for, and I do feel that all my relationships, romantic and otherwise, will flourish and be helped by the understanding this small book brought to me.     Don't be close minded and put off by the Christian bent. I'm not big into the religious thing, but if you can separate any biases you have and be objective about the universal truths and lessons offered in this book, I think you'll find you gain a lot. Look at it this way -- all religions teach love and compassion, and this is just another way to learn that and be a more loving, understanding and thoughtful person.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Batman of the comics was the hero with the \\"wow!\\"-factor, the hero who took care of \\"everyman\\". A hero has to grow up and move along with time, adapt to a culture in which drive-by shootings are not something of Bonnie and Clyde but \\"that neighborhood\\", in which the sports-hero shows miraculous muscle growth over time, in which every certainty starts having a question-mark.   We deserve this Batman; the man in the hero has his doubts and question marks, he struggles and comes through. He has become us. Go see the movie and let your mind do the wandering over the various levels at which this movie speaks to you, from the gut to the brain to the emotions. Live it and let your inner self grow.
6302860253|5.0|This was my comment on the condition of the tape of Carmen I got from Amazon, the class that I mention was my rebuttal to Carmen. I explain in that class that I loved the sound track to Carmen but I was surprised to find that the translation revealed the evil side of women in this movie. I think the reason why heaven blessed this with such good music was in the song by Mary Poppins, \\"A spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down\\". The truth can be a bit hard to swallow, but this well done movie was the first time the evil side of women was so clearly conveyed to me.  My rebuttal to the evil side of women is told better on my first class, (#1a at Vimeo), but the last class sums this movie of Carmen better.    Dear Mike Libby,     I got the tape in a few days and copied it to a dvd (it came in perfect), so I could record a class over it. That's class #127x12 at MikeOversonEndTimes-org. I talk about Carmen and show a few scenes of it in the first 30 minutes, you can tell I recorded over that tape at the very end (at 2:08 minutes). It was a perfect tape to record my \\"LAST CLASS & GOODBYE\\" on. (Because the evil side of women has ended the magic and wisdom heaven was sharing with \\"the one\\" to share with the public through these classes, and that made Carmen the perfect tape to record my \\"last class & goodbye\\" on). Thank you that it was in such good condition. (Class 127x13 is a 53 minute summary of 127x12 that I did for Vimeo, under MikeOversonEndTimes.)         I just looked at every review of Carmen and didn't find one by Leonard Maltin. However John A Furner's review: \\"Maltin's Carmen review is brain dead\\" was right next to my review. Being \\"the one\\" I've learned about the evil games they play on the internet to discredit, mock or slander what I'm doing, and this is an example of it. Fortunately for me, God has a way of complementing the things I do, and that includes even this movie review I did of Carmen. Before I tell it, I'll provide the instant knee jerk reaction to mock me and that is: \\"U R so vain!\\". That was the \\"Final Cut Express\\" I got on 10-12-09, (mocking me as U R so vain), that caused me to record \\"MY LAST CLASS AND GOODBYE\\" over the tape of Carmen the next day on 10-13-09. The amazing complement I found was in the lyrics to the song \\"Daniel\\" by Elton John. Though I've only seen (and loved) Spain on a tour video and in Carmen, I believe the lyrics refer to my premature death, that's from God ending my classes and my life soon due to \\"no thanks, no pay and no respect\\". As it says in the song: \\"Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane, I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain, oh I can see Daniel waving goodbye, God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes... Daniel my brother you are older than me, do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal, YOU'RE EYES HAVE DIED but you see more than I...Oh I can see Daniel waving goodbye, God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes\\".

B000005RST|4.0|MCMXC A.D. \\"The Limited Edition\\" being Enigma's debut album and their 1990 release is an album that brings back many memories for me. I remeber seeing the video Sadness on MTV back in my first year of going to Spyken. Here we get classic tracks such as \\"Sadeness\\", \\"Principles of Lust\\" and \\"Mea Culpa\\". The limited edition also includes 4 additional remixes not included on the original release. The artwork is quite nice and was done by H.P. Uertz. None of the lyrics are included. Allmusic gave this album a 4/5 in the review and I concur with this assessment. 4/5.

All the lyrics are inluded and also get a list of whom plays what on the album. 3/5.
B001UV4XWO|4.0|\\"The Box\\" is one of those films where a lot of adjectives are necessary. It's taut and suspenseful, but it's also metaphysical, ponderous, cerebral, unexplainable, and above all, preposterous. It goes in all different directions, sometimes caught up in circles, sometimes taking detours, sometimes going completely off course. It's a bizarre, unpredictable story of intrigue and paranoia, continuously twisting and turning, pushing the limits of comprehension with a slew of seemingly unrelated concepts; we begin with a button and a suitcase full of money, but this soon gives way to spiritual quandaries and sinister science fiction subplots, the latter of which involves radio signals from Mars, physical disfigurements, and hordes of mind-controlled drones with bleeding noses. There's even an ongoing social experiment, which could be indicative of a morality play.    Based on Richard Matheson's short story \\"Button, Button\\" and its 1986 \\"Twilight Zone\\" adaptation, \\"The Box\\" takes place in Richmond, Virginia in 1976, and I honestly don't know whether or not that's a significant plot point. We meet Norma and Arthur Lewis (Cameron Diaz and James Marsden), a cash-strapped suburban couple who awaken one morning to find a plainly wrapped package left at the front door. Inside is a black wooden box topped with an encased red button. Neither one knows what to make of it until receiving a visit from the mysterious Arlington Steward (Frank Langella), who, for as yet unknown reasons, is missing the left side of his face. If the Lewis' decide to unlock the box and push the button, he explains, two things will happen: They will be given $1 million dollars in cash, and someone they don't know will die.    Will one of them push the button? It's not as if they couldn't use the money. Norma, a literature professor, learned that her school will no longer provide free tuitions for children of the faculty, which doesn't bode well for her son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). She also has a severely damaged foot in need of repair. Arthur, a NASA scientist involved in the creation of a Mars camera, is no longer being considered for the astronaut program because he failed the psychological exam. But the fact remains: Their financial security will come at the expense of ending someone else's life. Norma tries to reason that it may be a death row inmate. Arthur tries to reason that it may be their neighbor or a baby. Heck, it may even be himself or their son. How well does she know either one of them? How well do they know her?    I'm not going to reveal whether or not the button gets pushed. I will say that, from this point on, the story ventures into even stranger territory, befuddling itself with inexplicable paranormal occurrences, gateways that may or may not lead to salvation, deeply rooted scientific conspiracies, motel rooms with maps pinned to the walls, secret wind tunnels, and a brief discussion of Sartre's vision of hell. Who is Arlington Steward? Who are the people walking around with nosebleeds? If the box is capable of being programmed, then why are there no mechanisms inside it? What's the significance of a murder that has a man on the run? Does Arthur's Mars-related research have anything to do with what's going on? Does Norma's damaged foot?    As to whether or not all the above questions are answered, I'm not entirely sure. Writer/director Richard Kelly clearly has his own ideas about logical story patterns and how they should be followed. And yet, there is something to be said for creating a sense of apprehension out of nothing at all; if you can engage the audience in spite of a cumbersome plot, if you can keep them hooked by continuously building tension, then you've made a successful film. \\"The Box\\" may be a confusing mess, but it's also one of the most absorbing mysteries I've seen all year. The plot can be deconstructed any number of ways, but I suspect we're not supposed to learn so much as experience. And we do. For a film that's neither believable nor understandable, that's quite an achievement.    The ending unfolds in yet another display of twisted logic, and it culminates in a final shot that brings up an entirely new series of questions. What's the message \\"The Box\\"? That damnation can only be avoided by resisting temptation? That humanity must be willing to sacrifice for the greater good in order to survive? That existence as we know it is just a temporary state and death is a period of transition? Or is it that there isn't a message at all, that the whole thing is just an exercise in psychological thrills? I know Kelly is aiming for something here, but unfortunately, I have no idea what that might be. No matter - what I appreciated most was the film's ability to build suspense and maintain an air of mystery. That must count for something.
B001UV4XTC|5.0|Larry Gopnik is a physics professor and family man who suddenly finds his life turned upside down. It starts when his wife takes up with Sy Ableman and continues with a seemingly endless stream of moral, legal and financial problems. Most people would fight back with a fury. But Gopnik has a timid and indecisive temperament, the kind that allows others to walk all over him while he wonders what he is doing wrong.     He goes to see two junior rabbis. They bring up issues related to God that has Gopnik questioning himself even further. But, stil feeling unsatisfied, he has a driving need to see Rabbi Marshak. However the senior rabbi is unwilling to talk with anyone besides boys who have just had their bar mitsvah. The film ends abruptly and with a sense of impending doom that leaves Gopnik more confused and doubting himself than ever.    I really loved this movie and I'm disappointed that it hasn't seemed to garner the widespread acclaim of the Coen brothers' \\"No Country For Old Man\\". But maybe it's very Jewish characters are difficult for some people to relate to. Personally, as an atheist \\"goy\\", I found Gopnik's struggles to be universal and enjoyed the movie's religious imagery and biblical references. Suburban life in the late 60's was also beautifully captured, including Gopnik's nervous lusting for a sunbathing neighbor. I especially enjoyed the subplot involving Gopnik' teen-age son, as his pot smoking, Jefferson Airplane listening and general rebelliousness signal the social changes occurring. The best film I have seen this year. Don't miss it!
B0021L8UPS|5.0|This was a very creepy, well-done movie. The characters were very convincing and the concept was quite clever. Thoroughly entertaining.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The Beatles' catalog FINALLY gets the treatment it deserves.    These are the clearest, sharpest copies of their recordings I have ever heard, and that includes the original British pressings as well as the legendary Mobile Fidelity LP's, which were supposedly cut from the same stereo masters.  A note to those who complained that the recordings were not remixed: we are lucky that they didn't try it.  Listen again to the Yellow Submarine Songtrack mixes and you'll see why.  Although those new mixes might have a bit more clarity or \\"punch\\", they just don't get all of the subtle effects, balances and sounds exactly right, and on the Sgt. Pepper cuts, for example, it's obvious.  I'd much rather have the cleanest possible copies of the original mixes, thank you.    Compared to the crude graphics of the 1987 CD's, the packaging is more in keeping with the caliber of the music (though not as nice as that of the mono boxed set, with its reproductions of the original LP jackets and inner sleeves).  One criticism, however: the cardboard sleeves are too tight for the discs, requiring you to grab the discs by their playing surface to pull them out.  Not a huge problem if you make copies for regular use and keep the originals in their sleeves (which is likely how those of us of limited wealth will treat them), but not as well thought-out as the rest of the package.  I'm glad Apple finally got their act together and produced these reissues while most of us original-generation fans are still around.  Now, onto the Christmas Messages, Shea Stadium, promotional films...    Buy it, you will not be disappointed.
0756656230|5.0|I began collecting Lego for me about 6 months ago...not many moms have this hobby, but it is a blast. After 15+ years of picking up and sorting the %&**&^%$%^& things, I decided to collect some girlie ones for me....gorgeous pastel ladies who could live in gorgeous pastel houses except when they are under attack by my husband's mean old trolls.  It took about 6 months of reading geeky product listings on [...] to figure out who is who and to whom they are related. Wish I had had the Standing Small minifigure book back then because it is just what I needed to identify and buy the female minifigs and house parts.   The photography of the minifigs is out of this world; we tried taking photos of some of our minifigs, and it is extremely difficult to capture the quality of detail in this book. Also I now know which ladies came in which set, and which guys' bodies would be great for sex changes into lovely ladies. May the fun begin!  The limited text (the pages are mostly filled with photos of Lego) explains how Lego developed in a chronological sequence that brings back happy memories of buying them 18 years ago for my then  3 year old son. The authors did a beautiful job of documenting the introduction of each set and type of Lego.   If you enjoy playing and collecting Lego as an adult, a child or an in between, these two books are a blessing.   For building ideas, read the above reviews as there are other sources more suited for building things not in the Lego sets. Our favorite is Brick Journal, which highlights many incredible creations each issue.  This two-book set is a masterpiece of fine art and history and a very entertaining read. I could not put it down last night when my husband pulled it out of his car as a gift for me.
0385504225|4.0|It took me several weeks to finish this book. I'd start, stop, start again. After I reread the first 80 pages or so several times, the book really picked up.<br /><br />There are over 1500 reviews posted, so I won't go over covered ground. I would like to state that the anticipation for this book was so great that Brown would have had a hard time producing a book that pleased everyone. It is much like the DaVinci Code in its writing, layout, dialogue etc. But whether you like the book or not, I think it is a fascinating look at Washington DC. The references scattered throughout the story made me want to revisit our capitol and start looking for the symbols.<br /><br />It seems from talking to others who have read the book you are either going to really like it or really dislike it. Hopefully, Brown will mix up his formula writing a bit for his next book. I think this one was perhaps too close to the DaVinci Code in its writing and plot execution which disappointed readers. I'm glad I stuck with it as I did end up really liking the book.
B0000019HU|5.0|This is probably one of my 10 albums to bring to a desert island. Stunning sound, creative and sensual, yet edgy and powerful. True ear-candy.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Live-action wise (the animated films having always retained a mature nature since 1992), this is the best take on Batman since Burton's two. Batman's origin's are explored and some of his training is delved into. Christian Bale makes for a good Batman, the voice that he uses for the character doesn't get on my nerves as most people would think but my main complaint are, like others, is the action sequences. There are too many fast cuts and the action is just barely indistinguishable. Michael Caine is the best Alfred, Michael Gough from the previous four hardly being in them until Batman & Robin, and that was only because he was dying. Caine's version is much more involved with Bruce and cares about him, a noted scene being when he's driving a poisoned Batman home. You can tell that he's deeply worried about him. Katie Holmes. How to describe her. Well she's more believable as a DA than Denise Richards was a physicist but she doesn't really convey any emotions (much like Lois Chiles and Barbara Bach from the Bond films). And her inexplicable interest in wanting to know Batman's name seems almost forced in my opinion. I know he saved her life, twice, but she's never really given any inclanation to really find out who he is. Liam Neeson and Cillian Murphy are perfect as Ra's al Ghul (Ra'Z al Ghul is not his name) and the Scarecrow respectively. My main problem with the villains, Scarecrow imparticular, is that they look nothing like their comic book counterparts. I know Nolan wants to keep a \\"realistic\\" look to the films but I wish he were a little more faithful to how they looked in the comics. The plot is very good, with plenty of twists and turns to keep a new viewer on their toes. Lastly, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer's score is quite good but their heroic theme is quite forgettable when compared to Danny Elfman's, but definitely a step up from that atrocious Elliot Goldenthal.
B001A3GSFW|1.0|i guess i just don't do punk.  i know it's uncool to trash the ramones, but having 10,000+ songs ranging from jazz, rock, pop, dance, hiphop, folk, indie, and more, this moronic, puerile stuff leaves me cold. i disliked it in 1979 and it hasn't improved on sampling their 'greatest hits' today. i'm not prone to neg reviews but just had to burst the 5-star bubble. if this is your bag you'll know within the first 10 secs because it's all the same.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Bad A$$ CD, the album continues to grow on me after a month, every song is great!
B001PR0YDA|5.0|...Sometimes creepy even. Ask the ghost of Christmas past.<br /><br />Going in, I wondered what this latest version of a Christmas Carol would have to offer, to differentiate itself from other versions. Songs? Crazy characters? Turns out that a lot of the fun here is the 3-D. The ariel view  throughout becomes like a ride through the streets of Jolly old England, circa 1836. Horse and buggys, street beggars, dogs... cool stuff. Zemekis pays close attention to details throughout, giving us a great sense of the dark, dismal, and the cold.<br /><br />Perfect set up for the widest array of ghostly scenes I think I've ever experienced in another Christmas Carol. Including Scrooge being chased around by a roaring Death Cab. Around Stave IV.<br /><br />I have a feeling that Zemekis may have lifted a few one-liners from Mr. Magoos 1962 opus version, but other than that, he follows the book very tightly, and offers a unique interpretation of the story. He still hasn't figured out how to CGI the eyes straight entirely in his work, but he puts this sqiff to use, in characters like Marleys Ghost, who does a neat trick with his eyes in one scene... oh yeah, and when he unties his jaw.. hillarious!<br /><br />I'm a big fan of a lot of Christmas Carols in general so I can't say its the best version I've ever seen; But this is a top shelf experience... see it in 3-D, so you can enjoy \\"the ride.\\"
B0007TKNCY|5.0|If I were to make a list of the best comedy films of all time, \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" would be #1 on the list. Followed by \\"Arsnic And Old  Lace\\" and \\"Way Out West\\".  This is a perfect example of the screwball comedies of the late 30s and early 40s.  Grant makes a perfect straight man for Hepburn`s character. Other reviews blow by blow details of the film, I`ll just say that if  laughter really is the best medicine, this should cure just about anything.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Conclusion: Digital effects without any emphasis on plot or acting.  I am writing this while watching it at my house with some friends over (yes, I am so bored from the movie that I am sitting here on my laptop while watching it).  About once every couple of minutes the writing and acting is so bad that we all just bust out laughing at the same time.  I cannot imagine anyone with an IQ over 80 enjoying this.  The action scenes actually have very little of the actors, it's mostly CG animation which is giving me PTSD flashbacks of Jar Jar Binks and Star Wars Episode 1.  Please do not support horrible films with your hard-earned money.  We have to reward those companies, directors, actors who produce quality films; and this certainly does not qualify.    Channing Tatum should never be allowed to \\"act\\" in a movie ever again.  Just because 15 year old girls think he is cute does not mean he should be in films.    Oh ya, the music is forgettable and is cookie-cutter C-movie quality.  All Hans Zimmer rip-off type music (not that his stuff is any good either).    Wow, as I write this, this movie gets worse.
0307266303|5.0|...and couldn't put it down.  I'm not a super-athlete, not even a runner, but this was one of the most inspiring books I have ever read.  It lays to rest all the current dogma about what makes a person a \\"great athlete,\\" and cuts to the meat of the matter--it's in his heart, his soul.  It sounds trite, I know, but trust me...the author says it so much better.  This book has so many amazing characters who are SO brilliantly described that they MUST be real...it's the perfect example of truth being stranger than fiction. This book made me tear up several times, it made me laugh, and I simply could not put it down.  The author is an extremely gifted storyteller, and I just cannot recommend this book enough.  For anyone!  Even couch potatoes...you've gotta read this book.
B000XTCBWS|4.0|Testament did us all a service by licensing this Ring cycle for commercial release.  That said, I have a few caveats.  First is the ridiculously high cost.  I purchased each of the Keilberth operas piecemeal as they were released... total cost over $200 or about 3 times the cost of the Bohm set which probably still remains the best balance for cast, perfomance, and sound quality.  But at least each of the individual Keilberth operas was lavishly produced and came complete with full libretto.  This new box set costs about the same and doesn't even come with librettos!  C'mon Testatment, being able to download the librettos from your website isn't the same and you know it (saves them some cost though...)<br /><br />Secondly, the performance, while very good, has been somewhat overrated by grateful Wagner fans thrilled at being able to hear Varnay, Hotter, Windgassen, etc. at their peak in (nearly) modern sound.  I tend to agree with some of the other reviewers who claim the Krauss 1953 cycle with nearly the same cast is a superior performance.  To be honest, I even slightly prefer the Keilberth 1952 cycle for the conductor's more rapid fire conducting (though the cast is weaker and the sound quality is far inferior).<br /><br />Since I wrote the above, I've been listening to the Keilberth cycle again.  Result?  Snore..... For some reason, despite all its obvious felicities, this Ring just can't seem to hold my attention.  It may be the sound.  I sometimes feel discombobulated when listening to this recording which has the strange quality of being almost, but not quite stereo. Voices and strings are heard in pretty good stereo, but the brass sounds like only average mono. I'd blame the Bayreuth acoustic but other Bayreuth recordings from Bohm and Barenboim don't sound like this.  The effect becomes more annoying the more I listen and I almost wish the entire recording was mono.<br /><br />But despite the sound, I'm afraid the true reason for my growing dissatisfactionwith this Ring is Keilberth's second rate conducting.  I don't get bored like this listening to Bohm, Furtwangler, or Karajan.  (Solti is definitely not boring either.  His overly aggressive, melodramatic way with the music is ideal for people with short attention spans.)  Not that these conductors are perfect.  Bohm sometimes has a problem with detail and color.  Karajan tends to homogenize everything to achieve a beauty of sound, etc...  But all three conductors have a special way with this music that I find emotionally engaging.  In comparison, Keilberth seems rather staid and boring.<br /><br />I hate to admit it, but I think that A. Maus had it right all along...
B002ELM5HY|3.0|Mark Knopfler has a unique story telling approach. This album has a nice English countryside feel to it but opens up with friendly Scottish vibe.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|I guess if you are 5 or are easily moved by fancy special effects then you will love this movie.  If you grew up watching and loved the GI JOE cartoon, then save yourself the frustration.  Worst adaptation ever and the story is way off mark.  I guess we should allow for some ingenuity and redefinition of story line as it moves to the big screen, but to me overall, it was empty.  Full of bad acting, cheesy one liners and overly annoying special effects.  A Transformer isn't even able to do all the crazy dumb stuff they do in this movie.  I love special effects, but this movie is proof that it can be done too much and in bad taste.  What was up with Snake Eyes leather lips?  I can only hope they will not make another.  I guess I'll have to settle for the original cartoon to watch the true American heroes.    I say yo blow, cause this movie is a bust.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|Wow this concert was one of the best I've seen. it is worth every penny. The video is window perfect, and the sound just amazed me. I felt as if I was there. Beyonce really knows how to give a true great show all around!!!! Highly Recommended!!!!
B001AVCFK6|1.0|Do you know who liked this film?All of the people with ADD who could never sit still long enough to watch the various Trek series and therefore were not fans. As for the real fans(of which group I am proud to count myself amongst), this film will hit you like seeing your dog getting run over on Christmas morning;it is that sad and heartbreaking to see what J.J. has done to what Mr. Roddenberry slaved and fought for; namely, a glorious vision of the future where mankind is trying to evolve and live in unity with the universe using logic, reason,and yes, sometimes raw emotions. I am a second generation Trekkie, have watched all of the series and films as well as having read a great number of various Trek novels, and guess what? 40+ years of history,alien and future human cultures, ethics, characters,etc. are destroyed with a single film.I hope that Mr.Nimoy received a great deal of money to justify this atrocity.Why do I feel so strongly? Let me begin:  1)Kirk is a wild criminal youth and goes from being kicked out of the Academy to acting captain in only a few scenes. Nonsense.  2) The Orion girl at the Academy. If you know anything about Trek history (which clearly Abrams does not),a nonFederation member cannot attend the Academy without the recommendation of someone in Starfleet.The Orion Syndicate is a group of slave trading pirates and does not belong to the Federation. Also, Orion females emit an intoxicating hormone which literally drives human men crazy and thus would not make for an ideal classmate or crewmate.  3) Spock is too emotional and too sexual.Vulcans feel the need for sex only once every 7 years and he is engaged to T'Pring on his homeworld. In the series, he wished to uphold his family honour and was fully ready to marry her. No romance with Uhura was presented.  4) Alternate timelines are just a lazy excuse for not wanting to follow the Trek vision. Sorry Abrams, but your \\"alternate Trek\\" universe was garbage, and worse than any made for tv SciFichannel movie. Romulus is gone,Vulcan is gone,everything we Trekkies love about the true Trek universe is gone and replaced by Twilight in Space.    I could go on, but I won't. Surfice it to say that if you are a true Trek fan, revelled in Mr. Roddenberry's vision of a better, more enlightened universe, you will hate this film. However, if you view Trek on the level of Flash Gordon and Star Wars you'll probably think that people like me are a bunch of crybabies. Each to his own. All I know is that at the end of this film, about half of the theatre was sitting with our mouths open and brains in a knot. \\"What just happened? Was that for real\\"? Those statements were uttered more than once as we realised that Abrams has just massacred our Bible. Was there anything good about it? The special effects were awesome, casting was pretty much on the mark (the actor who played the young McCoy could literally had been DeForrest Kelley's clone in every way). Young Kirk really didn't capture anything about Shatner, which I don't know if that was on purpose since Shatner was publicly upset about not being included, but I didn't care for him at all. Quinto(aka Sylar for Heroes fans) was excellent with the material, but this just wasn't thought out or written by anyone who remotely cared about Trek. If you are a nonTrekkie, please don't write about how I need to get a life or how great you found the film to be. Trek films are supposed to be for those of us who have loved the series for 30+ years, not for the special effect junkies who want to see explosions in space.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Like I've never seen it before. Bluray is a must for animation. I love it then and love it even more. The picture quality was 5/5 as well as the sound. Can't go wrong with this classic masterpiece and the dvd included worth the price!!!
B002NOAF9W|5.0|Prior to buying this I was a little apprehensive as I had read some less than complimentary reviews on Rolling Stones chat sites. Most people had an issue paying top dollar for what they percieved as re-packaged material. But I found otherwise. The DVD of outtake footage from the 1969 tour, although only 28 minutes in length, is superb. There is a sublime scene of the Stones and The Grateful Dead at a heliport about to head out to Altamont. Jagger clowns around while Jerry Garcia chuckles in the background. Priceless footage. The CD of BB King and Ike and Tina Turner and the 5 unreleased Stones tracks are also welcome new material and the enclosed Ethan Russell book is a very nice touch. In short, a little expensive but probably worht it for the die hard Stones fan.
B002GMNLLA|4.0|i think they followed up where the left off on above the weeping world. good songs although some i think get a bit long at times, dont like to critique a great band but i defenatly think that there previous album flowed a little easier.  still i love insomnium and being from boring old Kansas, its a great soundtrack to the gray cold winters here.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love all the exercises, they are easy to follow and keep up with!  I want to share it with everyone, I bought one for my sister and plan to buy for Christmas for my co-workers who workout or don't have time to.  I hate aerobics, I usually get lost trying to follow all the fancy moves, but this is perfect, it has cardio, strength and abs.  This gives you a great workout in 20 minutes! I love it!
B001EN71DG|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie itself, because there are plenty of other sites for that.  I want to comment specifically on the digitally remastered edition.  If you are one of those that refuses to watch the new version because \\"that's not how it looked when it came out\\", you should still get this set, because it includes the original format as well.  Personally, I was not born when these movies came out, so the raw, grainy version has no special place in my heart.  I have seen the old version, and it's cool.  But the remastered version, in my opinion, reflects what Lucas would have done had the technology been available.  If you want proof, look at episodes 1, 2, and 3.  If you don't own these movies already, buy this set.  If you only have the original version, buy this set anyway.
1933308087|5.0|What an absolute compedium of knowledge Jinny has amassed in this book.  If you want to know the history of a block, this book will tell you.  It is also a virtually endless source of block ideas, and a manual on how to decipher the drafting of any goven type of block, and how to draft the blocks yourself. And every single block shown in color, in real fabric.  What a visual delight!
B002MRROKS|5.0|Reading '92 is widely regarded as a great/important show in the Nirvana canon, as they were still ascending while touring \\"Nevermind\\" (though this set also has songs that would end up on \\"In Utero\\" in slightly different form).  This DVD presents the set in very good quality (some video limitations given the technology at the time, but overall, an vast improvement on the bootlegs i've seen) and the sound is terrific - i listened to it in DTS on my system and the mix sounded great (i also changed the sound field on my theater receiver to 'rock concert' which punched it up even more).  I bought the CD/DVD version, and the DVD is definitely better, in that the CD (while very good) has been edited for certain things (such as their take on a couple of bars of \\"more than a feeling\\" and some between-song-banter); the DVD has basically the whole thing, start to finish and runs around an hour-forty vs. the 78 min or so on CD.  Plus, the DVD includes Kurt's entrance in a wheelchair, which in context, is amusing, since he was rumored at the time to be in bad shape/questionable to perform, and that's something the CD doesn't convey, plus you get to see just how big the UK festival crowd is (and it's huge).  I never had a chance to see them live, but this really shows what a great live band they were - as a power trio, maybe they were the 'grunge Cream?'.  Grohl is a madman on drums here.  This one was worth the wait, no question.  What a shame it all ended in 1994......we could've used more music from guys like this over the last 15 years, for sure.
B002Q0F6V0|5.0|Didn't think I would have any interest in Alice without Layne, but heard some of the songs on Pandora and loved them.  Had to buy the album to add to my Alice collection.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I can't come up with  words to express how tremendous this box set is.  Come on, it's the greatest group ever and still great after all these years.  I showed my class of juniors in high school the DVD and they were ALL singing along.  \\"And in the end...The Beatles!!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I am a fan in China. Being his fan from 15 years before, and I hadn't realized that at all.    The movie makes me tears in eyes, makes me laugh, makes me moved, by his voice, his singing, his dancing.    I will keeply watching the movie untill it close, and I must have a DVD to seeing him anytime when I miss him.    Because, it is hardly to say goodbye to him.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|This is a rather good CD by this outstanding Canadian performer, though for some it may be to pop and a bit less jazz-y in comparison with Michael's previous releases. Yet, I think, finally this singer is finding his true voice in the music world, so he's challenging himself to do something different and go far and beyond the jazz standards, we all have been listening and liking so far. It's a bit of try & fail experiment, but he can certainly pull it off, and still go it satisfactorily right. So, I, for one, am still a die-hard fan of this amazing guy!
B0018Q0PXW|4.0|[[ASIN:B0018Q0PXW The Reluctant Fundamentalist]] is a cleverly written tale told entirely in the first person. Changez meets a man he assumes is American by the way the man carries himself. \\"It was your bearing that allowed me to identify you ... for I see your face is hardened.\\" Changez, a Pakistani sporting a beard, and the American sit together for tea and a meal at an outside restaurant in Lahore, Pakistan.<br /><br />Changez begins his fascinating, rapid fire story explaining how he spent four and a half years in America, where he graduated from Princeton and secured a good job with a valuation firm: Underwood Samson & Company. The Reluctant Fundamentalist quickly became adjusted, thriving in the Big Apple where he considered himself more New Yorker than American. Although the university secured his future, it \\"could not make me forget ... the city of my birth.\\"<br /><br />Changez tells the American how enamored he was with women's provocative attire compared to the traditional dress of Pakistan. He talks of a relationship with a woman named Erica whose former lover, Chris, died of cancer during an intense, intimate partnership. Although Changez desired her sexually, Erica could never forget Chris' ghost to become involved in another love affair.<br /><br />As he speaks, gentle Changez notices the hand of his American acquaintance clenched into a tight fist after saying he smiled when the twin towers fell on 9/11. To lighten the moment he says he \\"was caught up in the symbolism of it all,\\" powerful America was \\"so visibly brought to her knees.\\" To further ease tension, he almost rebukes the American by asking if he does not feel joy at video clips showing \\"American munitions laying waste the structures of your enemies?\\"<br /><br />A deep personal tension builds throughout [[ASIN:B0018Q0PXW The Reluctant Fundamentalist]]. Because bearded Changez looks foreign, he says he felt victimized after 9/11. When his other business partners passed through immigration without incident on a return trip from Manilla, he was pulled aside and practically strip-searched. All too often, a tire on his auto would be punctured, his badge went missing, his phone or fax line stopped working. He tells how he felt singled out even among friends.<br /><br />When the United States bombed terrorist targets in Afghanistan, Changez saw TV footage of American troops raiding a Taliban command post. He tells of the horror he felt as innocent country folk were sometimes killed along with suspected terrorists. Wrath overwhelmed him. Afghanistan and Pakistan were friendly Muslin neighbors. U.S. troops in Afghanistan could plunge the entire area into war since India was already flexing her muscles toward Pakistan.<br /><br />Changez continues baring his deepest feelings to the American as they eat. He confesses how disturbed he became to realize that as an evaluation analyst, he was enabling businesses in the United States or in puppet-like countries which shared similar philosophical ideals. These same conglomerates were responsible for American power, politics, and war mongering in the Middle East. As a result, he left everything: his moneyed job, his American friends, and Erica whom he never again located.<br /><br />Toward the end of their meal, Changez explains in detail how he returned to Pakistan where, as a university lecturer, he now used this platform to turn his countrymen against the United States. He organized student rallies to demonstrate for the independence of Pakistan's domestic and international affairs - demonstrations the press would label anti-American. Speaking before international television that came on campus, Changez told the networks: \\"... no country inflicts death so readily upon the inhabitants of other countries ... so far away, as America.\\"<br /><br />After their meal together ends, Changez walks his increasingly suspicious American acquaintance to his hotel. \\"I know you have found some of my views offensive,\\" he says, but \\"...we are bound by a certain shared intimacy.\\"<br />This tale will move anyone who has seen the demise of New York's twin towers, but from two different viewpoints. On the one hand, Americans see the catastrophic collision of jet liners into each of the towers that eventually collapsed killing thousands trapped inside.<br /><br />On the other hand, [[ASIN:B0018Q0PXW The Reluctant Fundamentalist]] sees the murderous effects of retaliatory war wrought in emotional anger against nations whose peoples are innocent but whose leaders or uncontrolled terrorist enclaves are caught up in religious fundamentalist philosophies.

The story is well thought out and meticulously written.

0393061310|5.0|Great book!  If you're going to say anything about politics you kind of have to read this book.  Which is a shame because it's really long and hard.  I nearly threw it on the floor about ten times because I was so sick of reading about different cereal crops and locations. But you know how it is -- you have to include a lot of proof if you're not going to say that rich white nations really deserve to be that way cos of their skills and hard work.
B00000478B|5.0|o.k. the truth of the matter is, most of Bird's revolutionary contributions to modern Jazz were well made and done with by the time he was signed to VERVE...  Verve was merely the world discovering that the atom had been split... 10 years earlier... and not quite being ready to fathom it, having it delivered with somewhat more easier to understand language than that on the DIAL and SAVOY session... ergo, Bird on VERVE... which represented a commercialization of Parker's sound, and in some ways \\"experimental stretching out\\" in a way, which many fans weren't quite ready to accept...<br /><br />As for me... well... its true I'll take the DIAL and SAVOY sessions any time... the set is still interesting because you get to hear the man at work outside the settings he was best known for, and how he applied the formula... Take, for example FUNKY BLUES, which more-so anticipates the type of Whiskey drinking blues that followers of his such as Stitt and Donaldson would popularize years later...  Other tunes feature Parker with Strings... Laura for one can best be described as haunting... and if you meditate on his great life and genius and how great and tragic it is while listening, can have as haunting effect as the changes to the tune itself.  (Stella has a similar vibe!)<br /><br />But then are tunes that in some ways are a bit less then hip... yet  - - do get you into it...  The orchestral mambos aside,<br />take OLD FOLKS - - it features very rich Swingle Singers type vocals... with Charlie Parker's bluesy wailing sax, Parker's artistry may not be taken to its highest level ever, but the arrangement itself IS... and one can almost imagine Bird laying back and smiling while taking a deep breath and digging the vocals between his solos...  -- Actually, I dig it - - including \\"If I Love Again\\"... and his famous version of \\"In The Still of the Night\\"...  In fact, listening to the Alt takes are interesting... The vocalists have a bit of trouble coming in, and the take is clearly run away... and just when its going nuts (vocalists are frantically speeding up trying to catch up with the rhythm section) I'm going, \\"Woe, woe, woe...\\" in my head, and finally, thank God you hear somebody, possibly the producer whistle to stop the take.  - - Despite that, after multiple takes, you can tell everyone is in good humor... despite one wreck after another... they obviously manage to pull it off... because it would turn out to be one of Bird's more memorable WITH STRINGS recordings.)<br /><br />...and the bebop side of BIRD is also presented... on CHI CHI for example its the old Charlie Parker live on 52nd Street theme, with one valuable catch... the recording quality is nice, full and rich...  In fact, there is a point in the middle of the compilation where Bird starts covering tunes like THE SONG IS YOU, STAR EYES and SHE ROTE (Out of Nowhere) and other standard based changes with a simple ensemble where he really shines and demonstrates being in top form.<br /><br />On top of that you have the JATP recordings... which in my book are sometimes more fun to listen to for the VIBE than BIRD himself (again, I prefer DIAL and SAVOY), but all important moment of Jazz (not to mention civil rights history - - read up on the story behind the story if you ever have the time!)<br /><br />As for my overall critique of the set, keep in mind that a great deal of it also has alt and false takes - - meaning that there's lot's of stuff that will delight the hard core Jazz historian/student of Bird that will annoy the average listener.  (Being die hard, every time I get to hear his voice, I tend to jump out of my seat... and I also enjoy the recording booth banter...)  - - I think another interesting point about the album is that one is left the question many have since asked... Had Bird lived what direction would he have gone...?  My guess, based an exhaustive listen of his music at that era... he probably would have done what many before him did... I imagine he would have stepped aside and become a \\"passionate follower\\" and contributer to whatever would come (most likely Hard Bop) - - while at the same time recording more publicly fathomable albums (like With Strings) - - the fervor of bop would have been gone, but I can imagine him on shows like Sullivan playing \\"cool\\" but bluesy hits of the era and kinda going in more of a Quincy Jones/Stan Getz/Paul Desmond type direction...  Most of his followers probably would prefer not to believe that... but that's what I imagine... and whatever, it doesn't matter, because the past is the past, and this is our only glimpse of it...<br /><br />As for the VERVE concept... well, they had a tendency to take well know Jazz stars of the era and burry them with great production and orchestrations... then say, \\"o.k. this is your track... do your thing...\\"  In the end, a lot of artists scored their biggest hits thank to the formula... (Take Jimmy Smith and Wes Montgomery!) but in the end, the truth is the way I see it is this:  If you dig the VERVE recording, its usually a cue:  Good artist... dig deeper... so:<br />All in all... if you want to dig Bird, get the SAVOY and DIAL sets... or consider the MASTER TAKES version of this set, but if you're a die hard like me...

0061020680|5.0|I'm currently reading/rereading the entire run of Discworld books, in order.  I previously had read about a third of all the books, but nowhere close to any order.  Death probably appears in more books than any other character in the series, and plays a major role in five of the titles in the series, this being the first.  This is the first one where we learn much about Death, where he lives, what rules governs his vocation, and his associates (like Albert).  And, we learn the delightful name of Death's fearful steed:  Binky.<br /><br />Like all of Pratchett's books, I find myself less interested in the plot of this novel than in the way it builds up a little bit of the Discworld universe.  I like out each book allows you to explore a little bit more of Discworld, of having the characters you know from one book interact with characters from another book, of learning a bit more about the mythology of the books.  I can recall hundreds of little details about characters, ideas, places, species, guilds, and the like, but I am not sure I can remember more than one or two plots or any of the books.  Pratchett is hardly the only writer of whom something like this holds true.  Pretty famously Raymond Chandler is not regarded as very good at plot.  You don't read FAREWELL MY LOVELY or THE GOODBYE LOOK in order to find out \\"what happens next.\\"  You read Chandler for his extraordinary characters, the amazingly seedy Los Angeles he describes, and his absolutely astonishing prose.  Interestingly, I think the main reason we read Pratchett is for his delightfully odd characters, the way he describes the Discworld, and his hysterically funny prose.  I don't think calling him the Raymond Chandler of comic fantasy would really help anyone understand his work, but they do share some similarities and virtues.<br /><br />I'm not sure how long it will take me to read all the books in the series.  I'm reading several books in between each Discworld book, so it may take me well over a year.  So far I'm only reading a couple of Pratchett's books a month.  But in a way this is a great thing.  For the next year and a half I'll be able to visit Pratchett's nutty creation again and again.ly reading a couple of Pratchett's books a month.  But in a way this is a great thing.

B000P7V46C|3.0|With Hackett gone, the creativity was getting spread a little too thin. Musically, the album is a masterpiece and would be acceptable to the casual listener.  It has a variety of colorful ballads: 'Ballad Of Big', 'Deep In The Motherlode', 'Little Nemo', 'The Lady Lies' but it just seems kinda empty and \\"plastically routined\\" with Collins singing by himself even with vocal overdubs.  I give it a 4 for the effort, but a 3 for reputation from the previous albums.  Two noteable presences of the album that are nothing lackluster are Banks's lush polyphonic synthesizer arrangements and Phil's drumming prowess.     If you're a 70's Genesis fan, it will most likely be your last album to recommend.  It does makes a good album to start with if you're not willing to take quite a plunge into the art/progressive rock scene of their earlier material, but your curiosity drives you to hear their sound before their huge pop era.

B002NOAF9W|4.0|I was delighted when I first heard about this being released, but then my next thought was.... are they going to use those damn disc holders that are used with so many other Deluxe Edition cds. You have to peel the disc off the tray and if it turns while you are doing this, you get a circular scratch on the disc from it rubbing on the tray on the opposite side of which you are prying. And many times the discs get this circular scratch in shipment.  Well I got my copy yesterday and sure enough, there was those damn peel and scratch disc holders again.  Other than that, I think ABKCO is doing a better job of releasing Stones material than the Stones are themselves.  Mick, Keith and company, before you go out on the road again, before you do anything for that matter, get yer ya ya's out and see that LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE ROLLING STONES gets released on blu-ray and DVD.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I purchased the BK-2 over the summer, and since its arrival I have used and abused it. I was so impressed with outdoor tasks that one would typically want a knife like this for that I decided to TRY to kill it.  From chopping wood to punching a hole in a junkyard car door, then prying said hole open, this knife shows little signs of fatigue.    If you want a solid, heavy duty knife, go with the BK-2.  It'll outlive anything else you've got.

0061864153|5.0|I started listening to Bon Jovi when I was 6...I am now 29. The first cassette tape (man, that makes me feel old!) I ever owned was New Jersey, and from there, my entire musical life was changed. I have followed Jovi through every album they've ever released, the break they took in the 90's that seemed to last forever, and have caught as many shows of theirs as I can...often dragging a reluctant father, who was then replace by an even MORE reluctant husband. So, without a doubt, Bon Jovi has, is, and always will be my favorite band.<br /><br />I have not yet seen the documentary that accompanies this book (I don't get Showtime...bummer), but the book is a very in-depth look into one of the worlds most successful bands. The guys speak candidly about their days starting out, just how green they were when they released their first few albums, and how much they've learned in the 25 years they've been making music. The photos are awesome. Many are concert shots, but there are a bunch of back-stage shots that offer a behind the scenes glimpse, as well as some personal family shots.<br /><br />Basically, if you're a fan of Bon Jovi, I absolutely recommend this. If you've followed their career and bought all the albums, then buy the book...you won't be disappointed.  I can't wait to see the documentary that goes along with this. A great book from a great band. Here's to another 25 years guys!
B002T9H2LK|4.0|When this film came out earlier this year,   I figured Quentin Tarrantino, Brad Pitt...should be good!  To me it was, with the exception of some of the   scenes which could've been cut shorter and their points   would have still been made.   But other than that, I loved it!  I went with two of my freinds and one of them acted   like the graphic violence was just too much for her   delicate sensibilities, and I thought to myself   \\"DUH!-It's Quentin Tarrantino!, i.e. Reservoir Dogs?  --Pulp Fiction?--From Dusk Til' Dawn?---Kill Bill 1 & 2?--  I think everyone knows by now that graphic violence   is a given when you see his movies!\\"     My other freind, a guy, found it just to be   \\"just okay\\", so see there you go...it's not a film   for everybody, but I found it to rank right up there   with Tarrantino's better work as a director.   As for Brad Pitt, I'm very bias when it comes to him...  I just think he and Johnny Depp can do no wrong in   anything that they play in!  (-:  But putting that aside and trying to be as analytical   as I can be for the sake of this review, I really found   his character to be quite believable as the ringleader of   a bunch of nazi-killing renegade soliders in WW2 who   suffer no fools and take no prisoners!   Eli Roth, the director of a lot of modern-day horror   fare was just that...HORRIFYING in his role as the   baseball bat-swinging, nazi-hating psycho \\"BEAR JEW\\"   who Brad's character refers to as THE REAPER!!  Brad effects his Missouri/Oklahoma southern accent  for this role, even though the character says he hails  from Tennessee!---But most people can't detect the difference.   Of course, being a QT film, there are plenty of sub plots   and plot twists all interwoven throughout, as well as   his trademark dark humor, culminating in an explosive ending.  So to those of you who haven't already seen it,   I'd say rent it first before buying it just to see if   it's your cup of tea. But I say it's a 4 star film for   sure, subtracting a point for the extra long scenes   that I mentioned earlier.  I have the 2-Disc version because there are some   great extras and deleted scenes that were cut,   but probably could've stayed to explain certain details,   like what's the backstory on Brad's character,   and how did he get those rope burn scars around his neck?  (HMMMMMM!!)

B000069KE0|3.0|Chicago - Chicago (3.13 stars)<br />Original Release: 1/26/1970<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Movin' In (3 stars)<br />This introductory song is like the song \\"Introduction\\" on Chicago Transfer Authority (CTA).  Musically it seems less intense than the former and in that light forebodes for me that character of what was originally the first of a two record album.  As in the introduction on CTA the lyrics are a kind of mission statement of the band's intentions.<br /><br />The Road (3 stars)<br />Another self-conscious song of a band member trying to seduce an adoring female fan into doing whatever they want and not worrying about the limited time, due to being on \\"the road\\", they will have together.<br /><br />Poem for the People (3 stars)<br />A little more musically interesting longer song.  The song's lyrics complain that close-minded people often dismiss so much of what goes on in the world.  The chorus ironically claims the world is a funny place but mostly nothing to laugh about.  I guess they mean funny strange rather than funny haha.<br /><br />In the Country (4 stars)<br />Song switches gears a bit half way through bringing up the intensity a notch with a slowly evolving suite of the central melody.  Lyrically the song finds inspiration in the country (vs the urban/city) via a chance encounter with a perfumed enchantress.  Song wraps up in a cool guitar coda bringing in an intense horn debriefing.  This song has more of the character of songs from Chicago's first album as it is longer and more complex but would still end up as one of CTA's shorter songs.<br /><br />Wake Up Sunshine (3 stars)<br />Lyrical appreciation of a woman who brings life and light into a man's life.  The lyrics could almost be literally about the sun except for the last line.  Upbeat instrumentals make this song more just a short, pleasant thought.<br /><br />Ballad for a Girl in Buchanan: (3 stars)<br />A possibly too quick whirlwind tour through the conflicting passions that can be awakened by one who feels the call of love.  The suite encompasses \\"Make Me Smile\\" through \\"Now More Than Ever\\".  Musically this suite feels as random as The Beatles' \\"Abbey Road\\" medley, yet despite the \\"Ballet's\\" central theme around which the music nicely rests, I felt hurried through it and I would compare it unfavorably to the Beatles' effort.  It seems I used to like this song more than I do now, so perhaps repeated listening has not proved favorable for my appreciation.  Only Make me Smile and Colour My World are, in and of themselves, long enough to constitute a full song, the rest of the songs clock in at well under 2 minutes.<br /><br />Make Me Smile (4 stars)<br />Optimistic look at love; the song feels like a fanfare at the end of a symphony or at the beginning which is precisely how this theme is utilized to define the suite that is the \\"Ballet\\".  Strong horns fuel the energy of this song and the suite.<br /><br />So Much to Say, So Much to Do (3 stars)<br />This song lets the air out of the tire bringing in ominous overtones that show the lover's hesitations, concerns, distractions.  Very short song that might have done with a longer treatment.  I'm not clear on some of the lyrics meaning.<br /><br />Anxiety's Moment (3 stars)<br />Instrumental suggests a moment of hesitation in the progress of a blossoming love; a tone of trouble sets in and crests into a musical conflict which resolves into...<br /><br />West Virginia Fantasies (3 stars)<br />...a countryside cruise theme...suggesting that perhaps lover's anxieties need a quick getaway to allow them a space to be examined.<br /><br />Colour My World (3 stars)<br />Piano piece with a slightly too brisk tempo for my tastes.  The lyrics evoke a renewed appreciation of the love that was first declared in \\"Make Me Smile\\".  I've often thought that the reason why a movie can just be about love is that love creates its own weather, its own drama.  This \\"Ballet\\" is like those emotions in minature.  Again for me the piano comes off as a bit heavy-handed (or, perhaps, heavy-fingered).  I also find myself wanting more sostenuto here.<br /><br />To Be Free (3 stars)<br />This instrumental suggests renewed commitment and determination.  Perhaps the singer/lover is now returning from West Virginia and driving all night back to chicago to see the love that had inspired all this inner drama.<br /><br />Now More Than Ever (3 stars)<br />We return to the theme of \\"Make Me smile\\" with a quick, happy ending; love will survive.<br /><br />Fancy Colours (4 stars)<br />The song begins with a soothing, tinkling of wind chimes and an organ's sustained note fades in making this one of the more imaginative beginnings to a Chicago song.  Then a bittersweet melody gives way to a wacky, upbeat theme.  Musically this song is very interesting.  The lyrics are a bit difficult but also evocative.  This innovative song introduces what was the second record of the two record album and heralds, for me, the fact that this second record brings back some of the flavor from CTA.  The song ends with a disturbing series of horn blasts.<br /><br />25 or 6 to 4 (4 stars)<br />This song also carries a strong sense of CTA.  It's intense rhythm recalls the guitar chorus of Led Zeppelin's \\"Babe I'm Gonna Leave You\\".  This theme is kept up throughout the song.  The lyrics effectively echo the sense of urgency, anticipation and expectation that the music portrays.<br /><br />Memories of Love: (3 stars)<br />This four part composition brings in a different tone with orchestral-like arrangements ending in a mournful song.  It is a nice change in tone but does not particular stand up well for me on its own.<br /><br />Prelude (3 stars)<br />Nice, gentle instrumental introduction to the two following instrumental movements.<br /><br />A.M. Mourning (3 stars)<br />Colorful orchestration sounds dated to me.  The theme moves gradually from morning to an orchestral climax which resolves into...<br /><br />P.M. Mourning (3 stars)<br />...a trumpet which paints a sultry evening.  Strings come in and add some tension followed by a brass section that adds some hope.<br /><br />Memories of Love (3 stars)<br />Plucked strings form the backdrop to a profoundly sad homage to a love just now lost.  The music doesn't quite hold up to the restrained passion of the lyrics for me and the overall composition doesn't hang together for me.<br /><br />It Better End Soon: (4 stars)<br />This four movement song works better for me than the \\"Ballet\\" or \\"Memories of Love\\".  I think it is due to its sharper focus.<br /><br />1st Movement (4 stars)<br />Revolution is in the air and its time to take it to the streets!  The horns strengthen the determination as always.  The lead vocalist convinces me that the time is drawing near...<br /><br />2nd Movement (4 stars)<br />Flute and guitar work together to provide a dialogue of sorts; a building jam that isn't too dense.  Also check out the Ian Anderson-esque vocalizations which seem from this recording to be comin from the flute player.<br /><br />3rd Movement (4 stars)<br />A melodic revolutionary rap.  You should be willing to pitch in and join the cause by the time this movement is done...or you ain't a true peace lovin' brother.<br /><br />4th Movement (4 stars)<br />Nice brief refrain with good horn section to close it out.<br /><br />Where Do We go From Here? (3 stars)<br />This appears to be an early work by Peter Cetera.  A good indication of his song writing capabilities, the interesting vocalizations almost make this a four-star song for me...but not quite.  This song makes something of a nice coda to \\"It Better End Soon\\".<br /><br />Make Me Smile [Single Version] (2 stars)<br />This version stitches together the vocalizations from \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"Now More Than Ever\\" leaving you no instrumental or bridge between the two.  It definite feels like the \\"Ballet\\" got gutted.<br /><br />25 or 6 to 4 [Single Version] (3 stars)<br />Version of the song for people with short attention spans.<br /><br />Album:<br />Having carefully reviewed each side and song of this two record album I have come to realize that I have a strong preference for songs composed by Robert Lamm.  The first record in this album does not feature Robert Lamm songs and, as such, introduces works by other members of Chicago that were less present on Chicago Transit Authority.  Apparently I appreciate the intense arrangement of horms that Lamm supplies.  Other songs allow the horns less restraint and so they become, to my ear, more ornamental in character, less strong, less Wagnerian.<br /><br />Also, it should be especially noted that the sound quality of the CD is very poor in comparison with Chicago Transit Authority and it hardly sounds like this album has been remastered.<br /><br />Progressive rock fans might like the \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchanan\\" more than I do, at least on this recording.  Perhaps a live rendition of this suite would suit me better.

Where Do We Go From Here? (3 stars)o a love just now lost.  The music doesn't quite hold up to the restrained passion of the lyrics for me and the overall composition doesn't hang together for me.    It Better End Soon: (4 stars)  This four movement song works better for me than the \\"Ballet\\" or \\"Memories of Love\\".  I think it is due to its sharper focus.    1st Movement (4 stars)  Revolution is in the air and its time to take it to the streets!  The horns strengthen the determination as always.  The lead vocalist convinces me that the time is drawing near...    2nd Movement (4 stars)  Flute and guitar work together to provide a dialogue of sorts; a building jam that isn't too dense.  Also check out the Ian Anderson-esque vocalizations which seem from this recording to be comin from the flute player.    3rd Movement (4 stars)  A melodic revolutionary rap.  You should be willing to pitch in and join the cause by the time this movement is done...or you ain't a true peace lovin' brother.    4th Movement (4 stars)  Nice brief refrain with good horn section to close it out.    Where Do We go From Here? (3 stars)  This appears to be an early work by Peter Cetera.  A good indication of his song writing capabilities, the interesting vocalizations almost make this a four-star song for me...but not quite.  This song makes something of a nice coda to \\"It Better End Soon\\".     Make Me Smile [Single Version] (2 stars)  This version stitches together the vocalizations from \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"Now More Than Ever\\" leaving you no instrumental or bridge between the two.  It definite feels like the \\"Ballet\\" got gutted.     25 or 6 to 4 [Single Version] (3 stars)  Version of the song for people with short attention spans.      Album:  Having carefully reviewed each side and song of this two record album I have come to realize that I have a strong preference for songs composed by Robert Lamm.  The first record in this album does not feature Robert Lamm songs and, as such, introduces works by other members of Chicago thatwere less present on Chicago Transit Authority.  Apparently I appreciate the intense arrangement of horms that Lamm supplies.  Other songs allow the horns less restraint and so they become, to my ear, more ornamental in character, less strong, less Wagnerian.    Also, it should be especially noted that the sound quality of the CD is very poor in comparison with Chicago Transit Authority and it hardly sounds like this album has been remastered.      Progressive rock fans might like the \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchanan\\" more than I do, at least on this recording.  Perhaps a live rendition of this suite would suit me better.

0385504225|1.0|I'm not going to write a lot here -- I'm going to keep it simple. I kept waiting for the plot to improve -- it didn't. I waiting for the ending to make up for it -- it didn't. I believed the hype and build-up for this book and bought it the instant it was available. That won't happen on the next book.

B002S0OBFK|1.0|Fortunately I saw this for free so I didn't have to walk out or anything. In my mind the Discovery channel show \\"Haunting\\" is scarier than this movie. Nothing really creepy happens until the final few minutes of the film, until then it's just a lot of creaky doors and banging.    I'd think if they gave the same budget to a local Halloween haunted house pretty much anywhere in the country they could have made a better, scarier, film.    The real strike against it is showing the ending in the commercials though. I kept waiting for the bit where Micha is thrown through the door... sure enough it happens... RIGHT AT THE END OF THE MOVIE! Literally 20 or 30 seconds from the end of the film.    Way to ruin things marketing department!
B000ZELISO|5.0|The original actor who played Dumbledore died he was very ill while filming the second Harry Potter movie.    I believe it was some form of cancer.. If you are a true Harry Potter fan you would know what happened to the actor.       I have a really great idea why dont people  who didnt like the movie stay home next time so the theatres arent crammed full of smelly people who leave before the end of the credits, and save room for those of us who want to be there.  Then the shows sould not sell out and real Harry Potter fans can see the movie.  Stay Home next time.  There are enough fans who will go see to make these movies successful.   Learn like other people have said that movies cannot always be a faithful adaptation of a book.  Dont not judge this movie based on the others but what it was made for and probably how JK Rowling wrote the book for.  The movie and book are made to set the scene for what is to come the final battle.  Yes some things are left out but I feel if people read the books instead of just watching the movies then they will know these things that do not need to be spelled out in every movie.  If you havent read the books I suggest you do so and you will see what JK was trying to do.   It is pure laziness of those peoples part who refuse to read the books, get up get the books and quit complaining about it.  And not be so critical of a movie that was great and enjoyable..
B002H3F7F6|3.0|Generally speaking, I give Sting four or five stars per album (including The Police with a few exceptions), and I'm not going to bash what he is doing here, but he took a turn with 2006's \\"Songs From The Labyrinth\\". Training himself to sing in a different tone and style, learning the lute, he is certainly following his muse. However, like anything in life, people like what they think you are, and then hate it when they discover there are other dimensions to you. Sting's career has been very much this way. Starting with this ska/punk sound in the early Police recordings, to a more ska/punk/reggae/jazz/pop sound in late Police work. Then onto more jazz/pop in Sting's early work graduating to classical stylings on \\"The Sould Cages\\" and then into adult contemporary, world middle-eastern music and onto electronica/dance/hip hop.<br /><br />To me this is the mark of a talented musician--able to adapt and adjust. There's no doubt about Sting's lyrical craft--one of the best in pop hands down. So here is \\"If On A Winter's Night...\\", which shares more in common with \\"Labyrinth\\" than anything else. Not a holiday or Christmas album, but a winter album. Now, I grew up in Colorado, and I KNOW what cold, bleak, dreary, desolate winter feels like! Listening to this in San Diego with clear sunny skies all about did not sever this wintry feeling, however. That's just it, this album sounds like winter, like it should be.<br /><br />This amounts to just average Sting, unfortunately. I don't know what happened, but this decade has not seen his best work. To be sure, there are some good songs buried in the large snow drifts here like \\"Gabriel's Message\\", \\"Soul Cake\\", \\"There Is No Rose Of Such Virtue\\", \\"The Snow It Melts The Soonest\\", \\"Lo, How A Rose E'er Blooming\\". This is tempered with blizzarding boredom like \\"Christmas At Sea\\", \\"Cold Song\\", \\"The Burning Babe\\", \\"Now Winter Comes Slowly\\", the mediocre revision of \\"The Hounds Of Winter\\" and \\"Balulalow\\". Thankfully, \\"Cherry Tree Carol\\", \\"Lullaby For An Anxious Child\\", \\"The Hurdy-Gurdy Man\\"(not to be confused with Donovan's classic), and You Only Cross My Mind In Winter\\" lift the tail end of this album out of Beowulf's entrails.<br /><br />It's high time to get back to basics with your next album, Sting. Let's rock.<br /><br />Here's how \\"If On A Winter's Night...\\" compares to Sting's other works:<br /><br />1978 Outlandos D'Amour: Three and a Half Stars<br />1979 Regatta De Blanc: Three and a Half Stars<br />1980 Zenyatta Mondatta: Four and a Half Stars<br />1981 Ghost In The Machine: Three and a Half Stars<br />1983 Synchronicity: Five Stars<br /><br />1985 The Dream Of The Blue Turtles: Four Stars<br />1987 Nothing Like The Sun...: Five Stars<br />1991 The Soul Cages: Three and a Half Stars<br />1993 Ten Summoner's Tales: Five Stars<br />1996 Mercury Falling: Five Stars<br />1999 Brand New Day: Five Stars<br />2003 Sacred Love: Three Stars<br />2006 Songs From The Labyrinth: Three Stars<br />2009 If On A Winter's Night...: Three StarsAnxious Child\\", \\"The Hurdy-Gurdy Man\\"(not to be confused with Donovan's classic), and You Only Cross My Mind In Winter\\" lift the tail end of this album out of Beowulf's entrails.

B001PR0YDA|5.0|As a fan of Charles Dickens (not only the Christmas Carol but all his works) I was very excited to see a new rendition of this Christmas classic.  I had high expectations with Jim Carrey performing Scrooge and the ghosts and I am very happy to say, I was not disappointed.  I won't clutter this review with much detail about the story, afterall, we all know it.<br /><br />The look of the movie in 3D is absolutely wonderful.  3D is either a success or a disappointment and in this film it's a success in my opinion.  It looks amazing, it's not just some doctored scenes with items pointing out at you...it's a full environmental experience.  The movie in its entirety is visually stunning.<br /><br />The story is very well told, it starts just as the book begins with Scrooge signing Marley's death certificate and unlike many renditions there is no narration through out..the story unfolds before your eyes and is told through the characters.  Jim Carrey is wonderful as the ghosts and Scrooge, in some instances I wouldn't even have realized it was his voice if I hadn't already known it.  Gary Oldman voices Bob Cratchit, that was a nice surprise.<br /><br />The ghosts travels with Scrooge were the best that I've seen and the most visually stunning, they do have an advantage with it not being live action and this also adds an appeal for younger children, making this rendition fit for the entire family. This story really is about hope and change and the \\"magic\\" of Christmas.  Robert Zemekis did a wonderful job here and he definately deserves a nod for understanding what this story is about.<br /><br />Also one more note: we got to see a 3D preview of the new movie Avatar and three other upcoming films, so make sure you arrive early, there are several previews in 3D that are exciting to see as well, so don't miss them waiting in line for popcorn.<br /><br />This film is a great way to start your holiday season.  So as Tiny Tim observed...God Bless Us, Everyone!

B001PR0YDA|3.0|When you see Jim Carrey portraying a lot of characters in a movie, you get excited because you know the potential he has when creativity is allowed (The Mask, for example). Unfortunately, this movie doesn't take advantage of their star. As a matter of fact, practically anyone could have played the roles he was given with the same excitement.<br /><br />The effects here are amazing, and the computer animation is wonderful. Their treatment of Marley's Ghost is by far the best of any Christmas Carol movie I've seen. It's actually scary, which is good. However, Jim's performance as Scrooge and the ghosts seems basically phoned in. He's playing the characters pretty much standard as any other version of the film. His interpretation of the Ghost of Christmas Past is actually the weakest I've seen (their decision for his overall design was strange anyway). This is one time they probably would have come off better to just let him play Scrooge and give the ghosts to someone else. Gary Oldham does a great job as Cratchit and Marley, actually stealing the show from Carrey's generic Scrooge.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting Scrooge to play like Ace Ventura or anything, but it would have been nice to see a little spark of fun in there somewhere. It seemed to me that Carrey was actually bored with the roles (since this was motion captured from him).<br /><br />Still, it's nice to see \\"A Christmas Carol\\" on screen again. This is pretty much a fairly standard version of the story and probably won't be considered \\"must see\\" for the holiday season after this year (like \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" or even other versions of \\"Christmas Carol\\"), but it was nice to see the 3D take on it.
1401323820|5.0|I love the TV Castle and now I love the Author Castle.  Hopefully, the three book deal mention on the TV will become a real deal in more books.  I enjoyed the book to the point I bought it from Amazon and after reading donated to my local library as they didn't have in their catalog.  It was fun with visualizing the characters in the book and matching them with TV.

B001IF252C|3.0|When I upgraded to a new-model MacBook Pro I realized (after getting setup) that I would need an adapter to get it to work with my Dell 30\\" display. The Apple Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter is the ONLY adapter that will work, so despite the horrible reviews on Apple for the product, I bought one (at the hefty $100 price tag).<br /><br />The adapter works fine most of the time. I connect my monitor to my laptop every weekday morning when I get to my office, and most of the time it works well. About 1/3 of the time when I connect it flickers single pixels or the entire screen. I have to disconnect and reconnect up to 5 times to get it to work, and sometimes that doesn't even work and I have to restart the computer with the cables attached.<br /><br />I have to say, if there was another option out there I'd purchase it in a heartbeat... but if you have a 30\\" display and a new model MacBook Pro I'm afraid you're stuck with this.
B000XA5K4I|1.0|The villain in this movies wears a Freemasonry lapel pin throughout (square and compass with a G in the middle).  Clearly we are meant to understand that \\"Mason = Evil.\\"  But it is not discussed anywhere in the movie and I don't get the point for making this lapel pin displayed so prominently in so many scenes.  Also, the end of the movie reveals the entire plot, if you can call it a plot, is about a man (Clive Owen) shooting hundreds of people in an attempt to assist an anti-second amendment agenda.  This makes no sense whatsoever.  Save your money.  Save your time.  Save your brain.
0743487486|5.0|This book provides a radical view of child rearing.  It is very well researched and it won the National Parenting Publications 2006 Gold Award. In addition to child rearing it reflects on interpersonal personal relations in general.  It is not difficult to read.  I found events from my own past that seem to confirm the views presented here.  The views presented here are truly based on love and RESPECT for one's children.  I believe this to be a truly seminal book and I highly recommend it.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|And this still isn't on DVD?  I've been waiting patiently for this show to be on DVD. I loved watching it during my teen years and I still love it. Daria was just so great and the stories. Pure Genius.   I hear that it'll be on DVD soon, and once it becomes available, I will be buying it. Hopefully, there are no episode missing and there are some DVD extras.  If you've never seen Daria, just watch it. It has all the typical teen stereotypes and the normal, and not so normal, teenage experiences and it's all told through the eyes of a sarcastic outcast, who still manages to be completely lovable.     EDIT:  Thank goodness this is finally on DVD. I will definitely be ordering it.  Now, if only I could get A Different World on DVD, I would never have to watch t.v. again, haha.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Remember when Star Trek was fun? Well, it's fun again. For folks who aren't interested in anything new or different, there's the grand old TOS series on DVD. For others, there's this (plus viewings of favorite TOS episodes).    Like many others, I left the movie theater with mixed feelings. The alternate universe, the destruction of Vulcan (which, since we've seen comparatively little of the planet over the years was oddly emotional), the Spock-Uhura thing...they were all...different. And the movie really was leaving all those changes in place. It didn't pull a fifth-act \\"save the future\\" stunt. But I also left feeling really, really happy because for two hours I had had lots and lots of real, true fun at a Star Trek movie. I'd laughed out loud, with the rest of the movie theater, from a genuine place. I'd felt suspense, even while wondering at some of the plot holes. I'd seen a thoroughly enjoyable movie that has at its core the study of the relationships that pop culture has immortalized. This was the first time that had happened since First Contact.    So I went to see it again, because I wanted to have fun again, and I got over the strangeness of the alternate universe and found I enjoyed it for what it was. Are there plot holes? Yes, as there are in every Star Trek movie. Is the villain strangely stupid? Yes, but why not another baddie bent on destruction rather than on salvation? Do things change? Yes, but if they didn't, there could never again be suspense in a Star Trek movie because we'd all know, deep down, that nothing was really at risk because everyone would have to be intact and in place in time for TOS to begin.    What makes it work is the fun and the excellent casting. Chris Pine captures the devil-may-care side of Kirk and throws in just enough spot-on Shatner moments (the leg-crossed chair-sitting, for example) to connect his performance with Shatner's without merely copying. Zachary Quinto comes off as a rough draft of the Spock we know from TOSand the movies--in a good way. I realized I'd become used to a Spock who's comfortable with himself, and Quinto captures the unease of being caught between two worlds very well. And Karl Urban just is Bones. He's obviously studied DeForest's performance (and I've read that he's a longtime Trekkie), and he had the whole theater with him with his one-liners. The fact that Pine and Quinto both present characters who are still in the process of becoming makes Urban's already-there Bones the perfect counterpoint. The rest of the cast all entertain and engage. I'm not sure the character of Sarek matches with the disapproving father that I always thought he was, but again, the situation he's reacting to is different than what has gone before, I really enjoyed watching him watch his son navigate some treacherous waters. And Bruce Greenwood's Pike is simply fabulous.    For me, this Star Trek is worth having on DVD because it's rewatchable because of the great character moments. The balance of character and excitement is perfect, and there are moments of real humor and moments of real emotion. Which is what many, many of the TOS episodes were about in the first place.     I think people new to the franchise will enjoy the movie because it is fast-paced and not too full of itself. After all, everyone already knows Kirk and Spock even if they never watched the series, so in a sense everyone's coming home to these characters, even if it's the first time they've really watched Star Trek. For people already into Star Trek--well, if you want exactly what you saw 40 years ago on TOS, watch TOS, but if you're up for some fun, this more than fits the bill. It cancels out none of the great TV (or the movies, which cannot all be called great by a long shot), it merely adds to the possible ways to have fun watching Star Trek. And that's a very good thing indeed.
B0021L9ME6|5.0|Totally underrated movie. Watch it on bluray on a 90 inches screen, it's looks fantastic ! The effects are awesome, Halle Berry superb and super good looking, and the story holds all the way for that kind of movie. Furthermore pretty funny also.. I think people totally misundestand this movie and don't take it for what it is. I was sitting back with a feeling of I'd really like to see a sequel but I guess thats not gonna happen since it's gotten all this bad critics.. If you have a good large HD screen, or like Halle Berry a little bit don't hesitate to buy it on bluray, it's amazing !
1405862416|1.0|A book about stopping oppression, tyranny, totalitarianism, and censorship gets dubbed into a simple censored version. An insult to the original book. People might say that this makes it more accessible to more people, but it doesn't. It doesn't because unless they read the full book they won't understand the real meaning, they'll understand some person at penguin readers opinion.
B000FGGE7C|4.0|All that I can say, so much better in Blu-Ray.  Watching the movie in HD you really truly get the idiosyncrasy pieces that the director was going for when the film was made.  The only question I have to ask still, when will there be a sequel? :-/
B001PR0YDA|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Ebenezer Scrooge begins the Christmas holiday with his usual miserly contempt, barking at his faithful clerk and his cheery nephew. But when the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come take him on an eye-opening journey revealing truths Old Scrooge is reluctant to face, he must open his heart to undo years of ill will before it's too late.    The cast led by Jim Carrey (as Scrooge / Ghost of Christmas Past / Scrooge as a Young Boy / Scrooge as a Teenage Boy / Scrooge as a Young Man / Scrooge as a Middle-Aged Man / Ghost of Christmas Present / Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Charles Dickens' novel) & directing by Robert Zemeckis (also produced) (who also directed \\"The Polar Express\\" (2004, also produced and wrote the screenplay), the \\"Back To The Future\\" (1985, also wrote the story and screenplay, 1989, also wrote the story & 1990, also wrote the story), \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" (1988), \\"Forrest Gump\\" (1994), \\"Contact\\" (1997, also produced), \\"Cast Away\\" (2000, also produced), \\"What Lies Beneath\\" (2000, also produced), & \\"Beowulf\\" (2007, also produced) is excellent!    The music by Alan Silvestri (who also did the music to Zemeckis' films since \\"Romancing The Stone\\" (1984), he also did the music to \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra\\" (2009) & \\"Night At The Museum: Battle Of The Smithsonian\\" (2009) is excellent! The cinematography by Robert Presley (who also did the cinematography to \\"The Polar Express\\" & \\"Beowulf\\") is excellent! The film editing by Jeremiah O'Driscoll (who also did the film editing to \\"The Polar Express\\" & \\"Beowulf\\") is excellent! The casting by Scot Boland, Victoria Burrows (both of did the casting to \\"The Polar Express\\" & the upcoming \\"The Lovely Bones\\" (2009) & Nina Gold (who also did the casting to \\"Bewoulf\\") is excellent! The production design by Doug Chiang (who also did the production design to \\"The Polar Express\\" & \\"Beowulf\\") is excellent!The art direction by Marc Gabbana (who was a concept artist on \\"The Polar Express\\" & \\"Beowulf\\") & Mike Stassi (who was an assistant art director on the upcoming \\"Avatar\\", \\"The Polar Express\\" & \\"Bewoulf\\"), he also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" (2010) is excellent! The set decoration by Karen O'Hara (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming \\"Alice In Wonderland\\", \\"What Lies Beneath\\", \\"Cast Away\\", \\"The Polar Express\\" & \\"Beowulf\\") is excellent!    This is an excellent telling of Charles Dickens' novel and one of the best telling of Scrooge's story ever made as a movie. This is another motion-capture hit for Zemeckis. Jim Carrey is impressive in 8 roles that were given to him by Zemeckis.
0385504225|3.0|There's an exciting and entertaining two hundred page book buried inside the 528 pages of Dan Brown's latest Robert Langdon thriller titled, The Lost Symbol. For readers who find value in pages per dollar, there's some benefit here in having more pages to turn, which might prolong a reader's pleasure. For me, the surplus pages riff with exposition that adds little to the novel. Unlike his earlier best sellers which drew heavy criticism from the Catholic Church and increased sales, The Lost Symbol is unlikely to irritate the institutions that Brown describes. In this case, Masonic ceremonies, symbols and buildings are likely to increase the range of Washington, D.C. tourism rather than lead to ire. The entire novel is the revelation to Langdon of a buried symbol long kept secret in Washington. Along the way, the adventure, suspense and plot twists can be entertaining, provided a reader has the patience to put up with superfluous exposition while awaiting the return of action.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B001L51RQE|3.0|Sting's voice is annoying, it's downright bloody shreking! Copeland's drumming is all over the place (is he really a member of this band) and Somers is just trying to hold the band togather. God bless him...     I can't understand the fascination with this group?
B00288KNJU|5.0|I'm not a die-hard movie critic, but I do enjoy movies immensely. I'm 18 years old, and I LOVE Coraline. The theme is dark and wonderfully done, weaving both Neil Geiman's book and Henry Selick's genius. I won't leave any spoilers, although I would recommend parents view this before letting their younger children watch it, especially if they frighten easily. There are some pretty intense scenes at the end!    Oh, and the 3D version is wonderful too, especially in Blu-Ray! I hate when movies are overtly 3D, to the point that watching them in 2D is very choppy and contains unnecessary scenes (Journey to the Center of the Earth, anyone?) But Coraline delivers a beautifully flowing movie and no scenes jumped out to me as being too overdone for the 3D effects. EVERYONE needs to watch this movie!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This movies is the best revenge movie ever. And the person that shipped it did a very good and quick job.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Saw this in the theater when it was released.  It was very well done with good but not great acting.  Great job though of staying in character based on the original series.  Action was excellent and the actual plot was well thought out.  If you've ever even mildly enjoyed the Star Trek movies or series, you should find this to be a good movie.

B001PO53IO|5.0|If you enjoy the Clone Wars series and have a BluRay player, you're doing a disservice to yourself if you don't pick this up. My cable company doesn't offer Cartoon Network in HD, so it's like seeing it all for the first time for me. There's a lot of great bonus features, although a commentary by Dave Filoni for each episode (a la Ron Moore's BSG podcast commentaries) would really top it off. And the booklet included has a lot of great pre-production and concept artwork, including a nice teaser of a certain group of characters from Season 2. Well worth picking up, and you won't find a better deal than Amazon.

B001GCUNW6|5.0|I recently watched all three Bluray's in succession.    Here is the rank:    1. Movie 3  2. Movie 1  3. Movie 2    1 and 2 are nearly a tie, but this one is a notch above them.    This movie is imaginative and adventurous making it a fun to watch.    Poor \\"Scratch.\\"  If he does not get a nibble on an acorn soon he'll be too thin and weak to chase them around our universe anymore.      I never stop rooting for that little fella!
B002H3F7F6|5.0|I enjoy the cd very, very much. It's the first time it happens to me since, maybe, Mercury Falling. I'm a bit hard to satisfy, needing many things... lyrics, arrangements, voice, production... and, above all, the feelings the songs arouse in me. This cd hit me in my heart. And in my soul. Sting chose songs and melodies to describe \\"winter\\" that are not usual and not expected. I also love the fact he \\"describes\\" Jesus, Mary, Joseph and the mystic of Christmas in a very human way. I mean: like they were human beings, with their feelings involved in all their tragic story. That it's ours also. Winter and death, mystical birth and human death as moments of our lives, of everyone's life. Voice, instruments, arrangement, are all very essential, all very \\"real\\" and simple. Again \\"Less is More\\", the Sting I love more.... Percussions are the winning key sometimes, giving the melodies a clear Eastern taste. Jesus was born there, isn't he?    - Gabriel's Message: it's so essential it's hard to think you can barely chage it, yet here it is a totally different song. Less airy, less mystical, more painful.... as the announcement was not only joy, but responsibility and sadness to. The Gloria with different intonation seems to ask us if really Gentle Mary should be glad of her destiny.    - Soul Cake: what to say? A masterpiece. Perfect in every respect, since the first bass/guitar notes. Only regret is for the final coda that, in my opinion, should have lasted much more. Hope in live performance. Again, the accent here is on the \\"souls\\" on human beings wandering in the cold searching for charity, for warmth, to lessen solitude and desperation. The trumpet playing God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen is simply genial, again playing with pain and sorrow a melody usually sang in joy and triumph. A perfect song for All Saints' Eve.... getting back our pagan traditions before it was transformed in Halloween...    - There is no Rose of Such Virtue: again percussions make the difference. And Sting several voices are perfectly intoned and mixed. The Alleluia gives shivers to me. The song gives joy and an airy feelings of love around us.    - The snow it smell the soonest: very slow, sore, very well sung. The guitar is beautiful and perfectly matches Sting voice. It's not an easy song of course, very slow and boring for people who love Sting for Roxanne only. I can perfectly understand why they hate this record...    - Christmas at Sea: again a masterpiece. Celtic Harp is one of my fave instruments at all, and the flavor it gives to the song is undeniable as well as the Mary MacMaster choir that works as refrain in a song more acted than sung. It seems a follow up of Island of Soul, a Soul Cages piece 20 years after. In Stevenson's poem the man sees the coast... and the house where he was born. Wallsend, maybe, after being all around the globe so many times, Sting returns home. Metaphor for death, maybe, or old age, understanding oneself, finding \\"home\\".    - Lo how a rose eer blooming: accordion is maybe one of the most sore instruments at all.... here it is perfectly matched by a sore voice, whispering in the middle, the Holy Secret of Virgin Mary holding the Savior. Pipes enters and we are in full Christmas time. Accordion vanishes in the night............    - Cold song: it's the following of In Darkness Let me Dwell..... Tragic, dramatic,  the violins recall me Inverno by Vivaldi. Sting voice is a bit too low in this one. Is the only song I'd prefer he would sing a little higher. That said, he sings well.    - The burning babe: once again painful but strong \\"holy\\" vision. The songs progresses in intensity with the vision told. Very '70s... It recalls me The Pentangle. A real gem, in my opinion. Tragic as only the death of a man that knows his destiny since the beginning. All of us, indeed, know we will die.... Again fading coda is a crime... It seems for some seconds the Blue Turtles are back.... older, wiser... too short.    - Now winter comes slowly:Purcell here, from the semi-Opera King Arthur. Of course a very hard thing to sing and digest.... I can't say I don't like it, but surely it's not Sting's cup of tea in my opinion. Again, a little higher could have been better. But the singing is very hard and Sting is good.      - Hounds of Winter: A very sore, sad cover. Different from the original one, more mature less rock. A different song indeed. Loneliness is all around. Violin makes the most with the voice in a beautiful arrangement.    - Balulalow: I don't like it at all. I don't like the melody in itself. I heard many version on YouTube since I knew Sting would have covered it but I can't stand it in any of it. Sorry, my fault.    - Cherry Tree Carol: this cover is essential bluesy and the guitar is wonderfully played. Sting sings very well the story about Joseph being a bit angry and then remorseful for what he said after having understood. Once again, Joseph is a man, caught in things bigger than him. Angelo Branduardi did a totally different cover of this Carol many years ago... between the two there is the entire galaxy. It's a matter of \\"reading\\" a story from one point of view or another. The harmonics beginning and closing the songs are nice and very evocative.    - Lullaby For an Anxious Child: nice, not very different from the recent cover. It perfectly inserts itself in the mood of the album. And remember that before Winter there is a far Spring.....    - Hurdy-Gurdy Man: ok, if you have listened to the \\"classical\\" version, say the Quasthoff one, you can be shocked, but since Sting is no baritone, I find his way of singing this \\"song\\" very good indeed. If Pavarotti could sing Popular songs, than a pop singer can sing classical opera like it was a song. The piece is beautiful, again loneliness, cold winter of life and weather, people don't understanding.... hungriness for success and human warmth. Accordion, violin and voice are perfectly mixed together.    - You only cross my mind in winter: Written on Bach's Sarabande from Cello Suite, it's a miracle. Evocative, ghostly, sweet and yet so sad.... lyrics are one of the best thing Sting ever wrote. But the silence of the snow is deafening............ and you look behind you to see if your personal ghosts are here with you.  And the last verse.... that Winter that closes the album and the journey is perfect.      Bonus Tracks    Bethlehem Down: I don't like this song very much, but Sting sings it very well. Arrangement is classic, orchestra and all very traditional.    Cradle's Song: Not including this one on the standard edition it's a crime  Angry  It's simply wonderful, very hard to sing, the Blake lyrics are wonderful. The arrangement is simple yet complex: it starts with voice and Celtic Harp only, then all other instruments enter one by one... and when trumpet does its melody.... you cry. Don't ask me why. Bass do a very nice work.... wonderful! It ends with jingle bells that are so far away from Christmas as you can imagine. The baby is sleeping, finally... and the music vanishes in a ringing of angelic little bell....I love it.     Coventry Carol: A very classic Christmas Carol, once again in a traditional settings, with violins pizzicato starting the song along with Sting. He sings very well, and the Choir Stile Antico is sublime, of course. Also the instrument under his voice during the strophe (a stopped guitar?) is very evocative of the necessity of singing quietly. It ends with Harp, voices and... little bells. A big contrast with the lyrics, telling us ferocious Herod was to slain all children in town...   It's a pity it's not in the main edition of the album.
076532413X|4.0|I've read 14 of Robert J. Sawyer's 18 novels to date, as well as 2 of his 3 short-story collections, and I would rate Flashforward as his second-best novel after Illegal Alien.  I have to admit, however, reading Sawyer is problemmatical.  For me, Sawyer's writing can be analyzed in a pro vs. con manner:    WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT SAWYER'S WRITING: His novels have incredibly fascinating and highly original premises with an excellent, thought-provoking exploration of their social and philosophical consequences that leaves you thinking about the story for days.  In fact, when seeing science-related articles in the news that touch upon philosophical issues, I find myself even years after reading a particular Sawyer book saying to myself \\"Hey, that reminds me of that Robert J. Sawyer story where...\\"  The other reason I like Sawyer is that he is one of the few modern authors who knows/remembers how to actually write a great ending to a story.  Many of his novels end with a really good bang, and even the \\"quieter\\" novels still have endings that leave you very satisfied.    WHAT'S NOT SO GREAT ABOUT SAWYER'S WRITING:  The quality of his prose is highly variable.  While on occasion (not often) his writing style is engaging, usually his prose is very bland, even awkward.  I've actually cringed at times when reading particular passages at how poorly written they are.  Sometimes he'll suddenly veer off in the middle of a crucial scene to spend nearly a page describing the geographical layout of Toronto or his favorite Star Trek episode, for no reason whatsoever except that Sawyer himself obviously thinks it's so boffo-neato!  Ugh!  Another problem is his characters - Sawyer puts the weight of terrible philosophical decisions and heart-wrenching emotional situations upon them, but has failed to develop the characters sufficiently to make the soul-searching angst of the character believable.  At other times, his characterizations are distorted by hitting us in the face repeatedly withreminders that a particular character was raped or abused, or has a terminal illness, or went through a painful divorce, etc., as if lumping the character into one of these societal categories is sufficient to explain their thoughts, emotions, and actions.  That's the other problem I have with Sawyer's writing - he keeps on repeating the same character situations from novel to novel - the psychologically scarred rape victim, the psychologically scarred divorcee, the desperate victim of a terminal illness, over and over and over.  It's gotten to the point where I welcome novels of his that don't feature such characters.  Finally, there's all the pop-culture references.  OK, so we KNOW you love Star Trek and classic TV sitcoms, Mr. Sawyer -- alright, already!    Anyway, ultimately the pluses outweigh the minuses for me. My favorite novels of his besides Flashforward are Illegal Alien, Starplex, Calculating God, End of an Era and Rollback.  Novels of his I did not care for are The Terminal Experiment and the Neanderthal Parallax trilogy.  His best-written novel in my opinion, in terms of quality prose, plot, and content is Frameshift.  It's also the one novel of his where the main character's personal baggage (in this case another terminal illness) is actually well-integrated into the storyline.  The only reason Frameshift isn't among my favorites is because I find the story very disturbing.    I have not read the Quintaglio Ascension trilogy (the idea of sentient dinosaurs strikes me as silly), nor his newest novel yet, Wake.
0061703087|3.0|What's obvious to the reader it's however extremely hard for the main character to discover. The story does keep the reader on the edge of their seat. Not the kind of sci-fi I enjoy the most.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Hearing the title -Get Lucky- I was not sure what to expect from Mark this time. The release in beginning fall was of course familiar.     Having it heard once I was enthusiastic about this CD and it has been getting better with each time listening to it. Best music to enjoy the fading year at the fireplace with a cup of tea. Good melodies, nice scottish folk elements paired with Mark Knopflers guitar riffs and licks make it perfect.  Strong recommendation!
B002JM1VJG|5.0|hi all you madonna fans out there.this is all the best bits just now on the one disc.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|One of the darker and most apocalyptic comic book adaptations yet to make it to screen, Watchmen is a super-powered epic in a dystopian world where the lines between right and wrong have been blurred and danger and doom seem to be closing in on all fronts.  It's famous for its darkness and its view of a cynical world, but I think it's going too far to call Watchmen a nihilistic movie.  For every look at the broken society it tales place in, every moment of human depravity, and every shade of despair, there's also an unexpectedly bright glimmer of hope, a chance at redemption, or a moment of tender beauty.  And of course, it all takes place in an action-pached, visually awesome panorama.       Taking place in an alternate version of 1985 America where superheroes and supervillains have existed since the late 30s and have changed the course of world history (including a quick ending to the Vietnam War that saw Vietnam become the 51st state), Watchmen opens in a dark, cynical world where a nuclear showdown between the U.S. and the Soviet Union seems imminent.  Superheroes - except for those acting under the auspices of the U.S. government - have been banned for several years now, although some rogue crimefighters still continue on in the shadows, such as the masked, highly violent vigilante Rorschach (played by Jackie Earl Haley).  We see through flashbacks how the relationship of superheroes, the general public, and the government had changed over the decades: originally greeted with great enthusiasm, beating back a crime wave in the 30s and 40s and helping to win World War II; the backlash a few years later including the hate crime murder of the openly lesbian superhero Silhouette and her lover, as well as the locking away of various costumed crimefighters into mental hospitals; the superhero rennaissance in the 1950s with the appearance of the first truly superpowered hero, the godlike Dr. Manhattan (played by Billy Crudup); the formation of the Watchmen with sincere hopes of saving the world; and the twilight of the superhero age with conflicting agendas between the heroes and the government, rifts within the superhero community opening up due in part to the increasingly open hyper-violence of characters like the 'superhero' The Comedian, public panic, and finally the banning of costumed crimefighters.  (And this is just the backstory to the main tale!) Which brings us into the movie's present, where Dr. Manhattan is one of the only 'legal' superhumans (who would be difficult to ban even if he weren't working alongside the government - his power surpasses that of the combined might of all the world's conventional and nuclear armies) - and the mentally unbalanced Rorschach leads a brutal one-man war against crime, while possessed of a seering hatred of the very world he's supposedly protecting.  And most of the former costumed heroes have simply slipped back into the fabric of society and are leading relatively 'normal' lives, their secret identities still mostly unknown.       Yes, it's difficult in the beginning to tell who the good guys are and who the bad guys are, and to some extent even after the movie's conclusion it's up to the viewer to decide who falls under which heading.  It's made somewhat clearer as the flashbacks bring in the long-standing motivations of various characters, as well as their often tragic pasts.  In my mind, by movie's end, there actually are some characters who deserve to be filed as true heroes, there are definately some true villains, and there are a lot who straddle that blurry line.  The lack of the movie clearly identifying in its early chapters who you're 'supposed' to root for and against ends up as a plus rather than a minus and fits in with Watchmen's somewhat non-linear storytelling.       After Rorschach decides that the death of one of the supposedly retired members of the old Watchmen team was actually a murder, he gets it in his head that someone's coming after all past and present superheroes, and attempts to enlist other former Watchmen to form a resistance.  He also seems to feel that this ties in to some grand conspiracy that's going to usher in the end of the world.  Largely dismissed as paranoid by his former peers - and with understandable reason given his increasingly erratic and hostile behavior in recent years - later events begin to add credence to at least some of Rorschach's theories.  But can he put the remaining members of the Watchmen back together, and if so, will that save the world or somehow destroy it?  In the overall story that, with flashbacks, covers years, we see heroes unable to stop the chaos in the world from spinning out of control and nearly go insane from it; we see heroes fall from grace and try to crawl their way back up; we see villains recognize at last the horrors of their own atrocities and attempt to go straight - or do they?; and we see the most powerful being on the planet slowly start losing the ability to relate to humans or to perceive existance in the same way mortals do.  In many of its instances Watchmen is as it's been touted - heroes struggling in an uphill battle to make a difference, and not always succeeding.  In other cases though it's a case of the Villains doing exactly the same thing - trying to make a difference and not always succeeding.  Because in the minds of most (not all) of the movie's real bad guys, they Think that what they're doing is for the greater good.  And what's even more potent than having them just all be insane with really twisted views of the world, when you see their reasoning and their goals, it often makes a horrifying kind of sense.       There's more subtext to the movie than could be discussed here.  A few random observations - the musical score and the use of various songs fits in absolutely perfectly with the onscreen happenings; the sudden return of two supposedly retired Watchmen to save the trapped inhabitants of a burning skyscraper is one of the most dramatic and awesome movie moments I've ever seen; the physical battles are incredible; the constantly changing patterns on Rorscach's mask are freaky cool; and Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre II is possibly the sexiest super-heroine yet seen on screen.       Watchmen succeeds hugely on multiple levels.  It should be noted that though this is a superhero movie, this definately isn't something to get in for your seven year-old Spider-Man/Iron Man fan (those movies are great too, but in a different way).  A grand, disturbing and enthralling epic.
B002MU4NLI|4.0|The box is pretty neat, it's has the classic picture of Bailey and his family with his angel looking up with a 3-D tree sits in the background with the ornament. I can understand people complaining about this little trinket, it's nothing really speical. If your a fan if this film you'll remember the angel saying every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings. That's the reason, I believe, for the bell. The package is wrapped in soft, red fabric but it can easily be ruined but it does look nice.    The movie itself is considered a classic. My only problem with the film is it told George's story very well and Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey did a great job. The movie took over an hour to tell the story of Bailey's life but the angel comes in and the story rushes along. The ending was magical to say the least but I wish they took more time to do the ending.     The movie is well worth the price it's an American classic. As long as dvd's and blu-ray and whatever comes after that exist, movie companies will always release the same dvds over and over again.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This book is very similar to the show Castle.  If you enjoy the show, you will enjoy the book.  It has the same witty humor, and there are parts of the book that had me thinking \\"That's exactly just what Richard Castle would write.\\"

The first 45 minutes played very well with good picture quality, but after the 45 minutes the DVD begin to freeze then showed video artifacts on the screen eventually the DVD just froze and would not play.

Very unhappy and the DVD has no useful purpose.  It is not playable.
0385504225|2.0|This book has no depth. I found I didn't care about any of the characters anywhere in the book. Worse, I kept seeing Tom Hanks as the lead.    This book was on a par with Hannibal. There really is a need for editors.    Save your money. If you can't pass entirely, borrow it from the library.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|A textbook example of how to ruin a successfull stage musical by translating it to the screen. Pad out the plot to inordinate length, replace some of the best songs with third rate ones, add all sorts of unnecessary embellishments to the plot, etc. Pass on this, and go for the 1999 Disney version, which is far superior.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|When you get Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris, and Morgan Freeman in one film you know you are in for a treat. This movie does not disappoint. Each of the actors does a superb job in each of his characters giving each incredible depth. Even Richard Harris' character is important even though he is only in a few scenes. Each of the characters both have their good traits and their evil ones. Eastwood and Freeman play reformed gunfighters turned farmers out to get one more bounty. The internal turmoil and conflict of going back to their old ways is played well by both. How violence has worn on each plays a central roll in the film. Hackman's character is the extreme law and order man who wants to control everything that goes on his town and will go to very violent means to make sure that he does.    Although this film is extremely violent in places, unlike a lot of other films it does an excellent job of showing the results of that violence on the perpetrators of that violence. They don't just walk away at ease with themselves.    The features on the blu-ray are pretty good but very dated. There is the behind the scenes feature, the interviews with the major actors, the voice over commentary, as well as a retrospective of Clint Eastwood's career up to that point. And that's the main drawback to the extras, they weren't updated for the blu-ray so they are about 15 years old. Not that big of deal for me, but something that someone might want to know.
0307454541|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson is a complex and well-written thriller and crime detection novel rolled into one.  The characters are compelling and hold your interest through almost 600 pages of translated text.  The one drawback is that some people will have difficulties with the somewhat graphic violence depicted upon people and property.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This movie was one I was very hesitant about watching but am glad I went to see it.  It turned out to be an exceptional true sci-fi movie which I greatly enjoyed.  Its a shame they dont make many more decent true sci-fi movies like this.
0793563836|5.0|This Complete Edition from Ed Frieland is fantastic. Thanks Ed for skipping the Tab that  so many instruction books use. I found this a clear and easy to follow set, I would  recommend it to all bass instructors as well. The spiral binding is a great touch.

B0029O08WA|4.0|As a \\"50-something\\" Twilight fan- I bought this as soon as it came out- and I LOVE it! It's as good-if not better-as the \\"Twilight\\" soundtrack-and easier to listen to-very mellow-and I was very unfamiliar with most of the musicians on the New Moon soundtrack-but will be exploring some of them now. I highly recomend this CD even if you're NOT an Edward/Bella fan(is that even possible?)
0316069906|5.0|Full disclosure: I'm neither a vegan nor a vegetarian.     I thought this book was a good read for the following reasons:    a. It's not merely an \\"essay of why you should not eat animals the way they're raised today\\". This is a story. He's telling HIS story. He embarked on a journey to see what worked \\"for him\\" (regarding food choices) and he takes you with him on this journey. He tells you many personal stories, about himself, his son, his family, that make the book nice to read and connect you to the author.  He tells many anecdotes of him \\"sneaking\\" into farms in the middle of the night that are very interesting, he has letters from family farmers and industrial farmers alike, etc.    b. He's not an \\"extremist\\" and actually seems to seek some kind of compromise. He does not advocate that animals should not be killed at all whatsoever. He advocates that the way we're raising (and killing) animals today is immoral.  Basically, there's one side that says \\"animals should not be consumed at all whatsoever\\", and another side that says... \\"let's eat cheap meat, even if this means we basically torture the animals throughout their lifetime and then kill them in a gruesome way\\". He seeks a compromise. Yes, we can eat meat. No, it's not necessary to eat as much meat as we do. Yes, we can find a way of farming that respects animals' rights.   I like that he tries to find \\"a middle way\\"    c. He substantiates his claims with facts, he doesn't make \\"emotional arguments\\".    To be honest, I think everyone should read this book. Whether you choose to continue to eat meat or not, whether you think animals deserve to be treated nicely or not, you should still read this book to see where your food comes from and to make an imformed choice. Knowledge is power :)
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Say hello to Fawlty Towers: The Complete Collection Remastered! This newly-remastered collection of the classic BBC comedy series will have you laughing like almost nothing else!    I'd had surprisingly little exposure to Fawlty Towers until fairly recently. Back when I was a wee lad I remember seeing about two episodes of the show. Lately I've seen a heck of a lot more and found it to be one of the best, most consistently funny shows ever made!    The series follows the lives of people staying and working in Fawlty Towers, what is possibly the worst hotel in all of England. It's located on the British coast where, it turns out, people actually voluntarily go for vacations during the summer (having swam in the Pacific Ocean in an area just about as far north as Southern England, I think they're quite mad). The hotel is run by the impossible-to-deal-with Basil Fawlty (John Cleese). With him are his long-suffering wife, longer-suffering maid and even longer-suffering Spanish bellhop, the scene stealing Manuel (Andrew Sachs).    The plots tend to be very simple, and occasionally reveal a great deal about the age of the show (it was made in 1975 and 1979), but the execution is genius. The comic timing on display is incredible, particularly that of Sachs and Cleese.    This newly remastered version of the show contains all twelve episodes (12?! That's it?! Not a lot, I know, but the recent great shows The Office and Extras also only have twelve standard episodes each), of the show. You also get a whole raft of extra features, including commentaries, interviews, outtakes, a little booklet and even a Torquay Tourist Guide! Nice!    This is a very funny show and a heck of a good deal. I can't possibly praise it enough. Go pick it up!
1569242739|3.0|I'm not a vegan (yet) but I am trying REALLY hard to be one. I love butter, eggs, and anything that's baked using them.     After the great reviews I've been reading about this book, I thought it was worth trying their recipes. I really wanted to like this book. I dreamed of making vegan goods and giving it to my non=vegan friends.     I've done 3 so far (+2 of frosting) and sadly I've been a little disappointed. Both versions of the \\"yellow vanilla cupcakes\\" did not taste great and were too \\"muffiny\\" in texture. The peanut butter cupcakes were OK for me, but everyone else that tried them did not like them (the texture was fine though). I think maybe they're too \\"molassy\\".... I don't know.    The \\"to-go\\" buttercream was also not good. The only thing that I LOVED and plan on keeping was the \\"chocolate mousse\\" frosting. I DO NOT like \\"buttercream\\" frostings in general and this frosting (with not shortening or butter) was very good (silky, rich, consistency sturdy enough to pipe). For the price of the book (around $10) I think the book was worth it because of this recipe and because it's really made me think of alternatives to doing vegan baked goods.    I will continue trying recipes from the book and I hope I'll be rewriting this review with more positive notes!
0385504225|5.0|Despite the criticisms of this book, (many of which are valid), I found it wonderfully entertaining. If you're looking for a literary masterpiece, perhaps you should look elsewhere -- but if you just plain want to curl up in bed with a good book, this is it

B0001611DI|5.0|this is an enGROSSing , absorbing , gripping , unique , scary , intelligent , fun pre CGI horror picture . others will go on at great length about its' attributes . they're right . i really haven't anything additional to add but my vote . they make lots of great film now . this is how they did it circa 78' on a relatively modest budget (that's an enormous understatement) . GEORGE ROMERO is a genius .
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I just watched \\"This is It\\" for the second time in a week. First on the regular screen the second time on the IMAX screen. Both leave me looking forward to my personal copy. I was never lucky enough to see Michael in person but growing up and listening and seeing him this movie was a true treasure and a gift from Michael to all of his fans. I can tell you that not a word was spoken during the entire movie by anyone nor was there any conversation as we left the theaters. It is a glimpse of how he worked with his directors, his dancers, his singers and musicians. Wow..not the perfect stage performace,,the way he directed, he moved, he felt and how he loved everyone..his drive for that perfect note and that perfect step. I never heard him raise his voice and although I understand that at the end Michael was not the final say in how his film was put together..I feel he would have been proud. Please don't judge him for his past actions (I believe he is innocent and never harmed any children, his intentions were honorable but in this day and age we all must be careful) Thank you Michael for giving all of us a chance to see you. I know you never meant to leave us and all of us fight some type of demon in our lives. God Bless and I hope that you have some peace now.
B0000509C4|3.0|if all i had to go on was the critics , i never would have seen this nifty little film . all the critics seem to have a favorable knee jerk reaction to the first film (name stars and whatnot) . it's not a bad picture either . i saw this at the time of release alone . i had very low expectations . i like comic books a lot and enjoyed the animation . i really liked the story about the stuff in the lake but thought the picture was kinda lame overall . i guess this must be what they characterize as a quilty pleasure . the film was released well before dvd and so on . i did not choose to see it again until dvd with its' correct aspect ratio . the picture kinda nagged at me or haunted me throughout the years until i did revisit it on dvd . today i bought it . i can't really rationalize why i like the picture so , but i do . i prefer it to the first film . when i told my wife we were gonna see CREEPSHOW 2 , she asked if that \\"was the one with the lake ?\\" excitedly . i think the critics are upset GEORGE ROMERO did not direct this little omnibus . rather like AMICUS anthology films , this one may grow on you . it's no knockout but it sure is fun .
B0021L9MJG|4.0|I've always been a fan of the original Creepshow movie. Classic scares with a wicked sense of humor and some great star power. The sfx are lodged in the '80s but were no means cheesy for the time period. The movie looks great in hi-def but I would liked to have seen a few more extras beyond the theatrical trailer. If you are a fan of the film or enjoy a fun scare then this film is for you.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|WHEN MICHAEL DIED IT BROKE MY HEART. I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH HIM AND HIS MUSIC SINCE \\"THRILLER\\". THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME. IT SHOWS HOW INTO HIS SHOWS HE REALLY GOT. NOW I KNOW WHY SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID YOU NEVER SAY NO TO MICHAEL JACKSON. HE KNOWS HOW HE WANTS TO DO HIS SHOWS AND HIS MUSIC, AND THATS THE WAY IT IS. THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER MICHAEL JACKSON. HE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE KING OF POP. IF I DIDN'T LIKE ELVIS SO MUCH. I'D SAY MICHAEL WAS THE KING OF MUSIC. ANY MICHAEL FAN NEEDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE, AND MORE THAN ONCE.
0545123267|3.0|Feelings are mixed coming out of reading this book. On one hand, I think it was interesting and compelling, while on the other hand I think that it lacked depth and substance.<br /><br />I like the authors take on the supernatural werewolves. It was unlike anything I have read thus far, and that always goes a long way with me. Originality is so important, and unfortunately a lot of books lack it, especially within the supernatural YA realm.<br /><br />Grace was attacked by wolves as a child, and has ever since been fascinated with them, one in particular draws the most interest from her. When she finds \\"her\\" wolf Sam in human form, and injured, she feels compelled to stop at nothing to help this wolf.<br /><br />Clocking in at close to 400 pages, this book has plenty of time to develop complex relationships between characters. I found the emotions to be very superficial, and lacking any sort of real depth. I could feel the author reaching for that depth, but sadly falling short again and again. This short step leaves a lot of the story seeming melodramatic and tiresome.<br /><br />For a large portion of the book, the main character Grace isn't attending school. She had never missed a day prior to her wolf lover becoming human so it would stand to reason that her extended absence would be noticed. The author makes a slight attempt to explain why truancy officers aren't banging down her door, but falls short yet again. We wind up with a teenage girl, that has a wolf/ boy living in her room and sleeping with her every night, while she skips school everyday and hangs out at candy shops. Some explanation was absolutely necessary.<br /><br />The overall story-line is interesting, but the bits a pieces that contribute to that story-line aren't strong enough to hold it together and make it believable.<br /><br />While overall I would say that I have lukewarm feelings toward this book, in the long run it is quite forgettable.
031606792X|2.0|Let me just start by saying, I agree with what some other reviewers said  first and foremost being  the writer's lack of description:  had I not seen twilight before reading these books, I'd barely have any sort of mental image of the characters or the scene    then, the biggest anti-climax I've ever been wound up for:  she gets married, and it goes perfectly  she gets pregnant, and she's thrilled by it  -minor conflict; edward doesn't want it. quickly squashed in the blink of an eye, when she gets Rosalie on her side  conflict resolved  -minor conflict of pre-mentioned conflict; JACOB doesn't want her to keep it; quickly squashed in the blink of an eye, when she brushes him off. he accepts it, no more said about that  then she almost dies and then does, and is a perfect vampire with a perfect baby in a perfect life where she doesn't react the way they thought, avoiding a whole 'nother plot development  and the other conflict in the story is, you guessed it, quickly squashed in the blink of an eye. they call up some friends, alice leaves and comes to the rescue at the end it's so painful how easily YOU CAN SEE IT COMING FROM THE POINT WHERE ALICE LEAVES  Bella's stupid assumptions that 'if alice doesn't think there's a chance, then it must be so' is really boring and you can tell what she's up to, and then a crap load of people show up like you knew they would  and in the end alice comes back with the smoking gun evidence needed to resolve the situation with the volturi like you knew she would  and they all live happily ever after like they should, would, and do.  after all the hype and taking the time to read the first three books (which were good, I admit)  I feel as though I've just been broke down, rode hard and put away wet
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I wasn't too sure if I would like this book or not.  A book of letters... didn't sound enticing to me at all.  However, I must say that the author has done a magnificent job of drawing me in.  I love these characters!  I'm ready to pack up and move to Guernsey!  Not only do I like the characters, but I love the writing, the kindness and consideration of each other, the politeness and courtesy!  Where has it all gone?  It brings to mind a slower paced life with time to value friendships and share.<br /><br />This book has led me in a multitude of directions, I want to know MORE!  I've already downloaded information about Charles Lamb.  I've visited the Guernsey travel site.  I've looked up a recipe for potato peel pie!<br /><br />Obviously I'm enjoying the book.  I haven't finished it yet, but I had to share that this is one of the best reads I've had in awhile.  I'm a mystery/thriller kind of gal, so for me to rave about a book like this, it definitely says a lot about the book, the author, and the writing style.  I'm so grateful my book club \\"forced\\" me to read it.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood Season One is worth every penny! The acting doesn't make you want to vomit. You get sucked in (pun intended) because you get attached to the characters. I love the satire. The characters have unbelievable accents that make you feel as though you are in Louisiana.    Can't wait to buy season two!
B001GCUO1Q|3.0|Nothing special about this movie. The plot line is a little too loose and the writting nothing special. The movie relies on it's special effects to keep the viewer entertained. The effects are good, but a better plot would have helped a lot. Jackman is good in his role, but the role is limited. This could have been better. Of course I'm comparing it to Spiderman and Watchmen and that's a high standard to reach, but they are the competition.
0143038583|5.0|The top two reviews have done an admirable job reviewing this book.  I want to focus simply on the vegetarian section, indicating something I think he missed, and pointing out a couple things he writes that I think miss the mark.<br />The thing I think he missed in this section is that a major reason to be a vegetarian, aside from animal rights, the suffering they feel, whether or not they have a face--all of which is covered well in the section--is to be a pacifist.  For me this was the major reason to become a vegetarian.  I was convinced by another book about 15 years ago - \\"Diet for a New America\\".  Robbins, the author of that book, chronicled a host of reasons to ge veg (environment, vegetarian athletes, health), but for me the strongest argument was to consider the way that eating animals could be viewed as a \\"gateway behavior\\" to accepting violence in other realms of life.  I believe that acceptance of eating animals gives us all an edge such that, if there is a balance in question, where an argument could almost go either way--to punish or not, to kill or not, to invade or not--our daily diet will push us in the direction of bloodlust.<br />While I agree that being a vegetarian separates us from our relatives and even tradition itself, I think there are many things a thousand years from now that no one will be sorry are lost traditions, and that our current method of meat eating is one of those things (let's keep it open for discussion that there might be some form of test-tube meat that everyone will find acceptable in the future).<br />Further, I think Pollan misses the beat on a couple things in this section.  First, the proposal that \\"Under the pressure of the hunt, anthropologists tell us, the human brain grew in size and complexity....\\"  Well, that is one theory.  And it surely has merit.  But aren't there a number of other possibilities?  Aren't there theories that we evolved more as scavengers than hunters, that our bigger brains had more to do with the mind-bending task of socializing in larger groups.  I am no authority.  I dabble in this.  It seems to me that this point could have used more research and that Pollan was all too willing to accept hunting as the reason for big brains.<br />Second, Pollan then goes on to suggest that \\"much will be lost\\" by shedding our carnivorous habits.  Isn't this a vagueness we can be spared.  He is waxing nostalgic about our lost hunter ways, and not adding to his prior argument about lost traditions, either.<br />Third, he points out the irony that \\"animal rights...asks us to acknowledge all we share with animals, and then to act toward them in a most unanimalistic way.\\"  I hope the reader will agree with me that \\"we\\" do not \\"act\\" toward animals.  Pollan labors extensively elsewhere in the book to show how removed we are from what we are eating.  We \\"act\\" toward the animal that produced the steak on our plate about as much as we acted upon the broccoli plant that produced the side dish.<br />Fourth and finally, did he really need to mention sex?  He asks us not to trivialize the desire to eat meat, likening it to the absurd result of trivializing sex on the basis that we can reproduce without it.  This is too much.  Yes, we can eat alternative veggie meats.  Yes we can reproduce without the act of sex.  Such reproduction is hugely expensive though.  It's unreasonabe to argue that sex is only for reproduction.  Maybe that was another reason to have a big brain, to help us in the long-term relationships we need to raise children beyond the days, weeks, months or rarely few years of our animal cousins.  So I make his point on sex, but that doesn't argue for the comparison to the desire to eat animals.  Sex is part of our social fabric, and not too likely to be replaced in the near future.  But veggie meat alternatives are here, and it doesn't seem as if it would tear a society apart to divorce themselves from that bad habit.  It hasn't hurt India.ding task of socializing in larger groups.  I am no authority.  I dabble in this.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|The newly-released blu ray version of the film looks wonderful - great contrasts, very clear picture, especially in the B&W version.  (The disc comes with both the color and B&W versions).  The picture is in its original aspect ratio 1.33:1, so it is shown in pillarbox (black bars on the sides of the display).  The true videophiles will appreciate that nothing was cropped from the original image.

They and their cast of characters will all appear cartoonish in comparison. Of course, this is a movie about the mafia from the working man/gangster point of view, where \\"The Godfather\\" was a mafia movie filmed from the viewpoint of the executive suite, so there really is no valid comparison there. \\"Goodfellas\\" really does seem ahead of its time when you realize that the only artistic work about the mafia that compares to it in quality is the HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\", which debuted nine years after this movie was made. \\"Goodfellas\\" tells the real-life story of mobster Henry Hill, and it is largely true, although there are individual scenes that are out of sequence and others that were added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the coca ine down the toilet during the drug bust. Also, Tommy, the character that Joe Pesci played and the part for which he won an Oscar, was actually a composite of two separate gangsters. Other details are omitted completely, probably because they would have spun the movie off in too many different directions. For example, crime boss \\"Big Paulie\\" actually was having an affair with Henry Hill's wife, Karen. When Tommy tried to assault her and Paulie found out, that was when he alerted the Gambinos to the fact that Tommy had killed their missing crew member, \\"made man\\" Billy Batts, nine years earlier. This is the true reason that it took so long for Tommy to be killed over that incident. Thus, masterful direction of the story by Martin Scorsese in what was probably his finest film is why the audience has a more cohesive view of the mobsters portrayed in this movie than if we had been told every last detail.<br /><br />What really makes this movie great is all of the personal details that enable you to see these mobsters living a largely suburban life, concerned about kids'  birthday parties and getting the sauce just right for dinner, and all the while completely immersed in a completely amoral lifestyle in which murder and bribes solve everything- a lifestyle to which they would never voluntarily choose an alternative.<br /><br />The film I recommend as one of the classics, but as for this version, if you have the Blu version already and you have the documentary on the gangster film, I can't see putting out this kind of money for four mobster related cartoons.<br /><br />Film - 5/5<br />Extra features 2/5 (nothing we haven't seen before)<br />Averaged together = 3.5 stars<br /><br />I round up from 3.5 to 4 stars just out of respect for the film.ere added for dramatic effect, such as Karen Hill flushing the coca ine down the toilet during the drug bust.

B0029O08WA|2.0|In my opinion the first soundtrack was soooo much better than this one.  I am hoping that after seeing the movie the music will make sense and I may like it better.  I'm just worried if I will like the movie if this is the mmusic chosen for it.  I couldn't even listen to every song all the way through.  The only one I kinda liked was Meet Me at the Equinox.  This music was just not my cup of tea.  I bought it because it was the soundtrack but still think I may have wasted my money.  I am warning people about it before they buy it.  I was just disappointed.  I expected better and maybe the next sountrack will be more to my liking.
B001FB55H6|1.0|I already entered one review, which was not posted, apparently because it was a pure angry rant. I admit that. So this time I thought I'd try to explain why I didn't like it because I feel that science-fiction lovers, such as I, really need to be fore-warned about what they are in for.<br /><br />I wanted to give this 0 stars, but that's not allowed.<br /><br />Unless you are prepared to be assaulted with 3 endless hours of non-stop (and extremely graphic) murder, mutilation and dismemberment, avoid this movie. There is nothing to balance all this endless, nauseating violence. Not a single character rises above the level of thrill-killer. There's no one to identify with, or care about. Every character is more-or-less depraved, mostly more.<br /><br />\\"Texas Chainsaw Murders\\" is way more sophisticated movie-making, character development, and script-writing, except that mega-millions of investment dollars were sent down the tubes on actors and FX in \\"Watchmen\\".<br /><br />The \\"alternate reality\\" is 24/7 nighttime, 24/7 rainfall, 24/7 squalor. It's implausible even in a hypothetical way. (What do people in this world eat, if there's never a ray of sun?) No civilization, even a made-up one, can exist if every person gets his jollies murdering every other person.<br /><br />I planned to enjoy my dinner while watching it. My dinner was spoiled and my evening ruined. I had to stop it in the middle, but started up again to see if there was somehow a brilliant revelation at the end to make it worth enduring. But that did not happen at all, it was just more of the same ugliness right through to the dopey predictable end.<br /><br />The actors are all excellent, given the hopelessly .05-dimensional creep characters they have to play. It was really a pleasure to see Stephen McHattie again (before he got a bullet through his head). Billy Crudup is unrecognizable, and thus perhaps this will not be a blot on his otherwise distinguished career.<br /><br />The special FX are also superb, sometimes fascinating. No fault there, either.<br /><br />\\"The Incredibles\\" by Pixar handled the same concept with complete brilliance by comparison. This movie amounts to the equivalent of a spoiled adolescent's way of getting attention by beating up smaller kids, breaking their toys, and shouting obscenities. That is the intellectual level of this excuse for a big-budget movie.<br /><br />The writers, director and producers of this movie should take a lesson from any Japanese anime, in which all the elements of character, plot, love-interest, struggle against opposition, personal demons, temptation, redemption, etc. are carefully handled with sublty and craftsmanship. You will find none of that in this awful flick. What you will find is blood in your face, compound fractures, body parts, splattered screaming corpses, and laughter at murder.  No point to it at all. Repeated over and over.<br /><br />I really feel that anyone who can sit through three hours of this extremely inhuman, sadistic, in-your-face murder and mutilation of people and their corpses, and say they like it, has real sociopathic tendencies and ought to be under close observation by mental health professionals.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|When I first saw this movie was coming out, I didn't have high hopes for it at all. I thought they were going to ruin it like they do normally do with other series of movies. but I was wrong, and gladly take back my negative thoughts of it.  It blew me away, and definitely gave the element of surprise with a few twists as well as a big give-away near the end.  Definitely check it out, its worth it!

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is a story and characters I will not soon forget. Although fictitious, young Liesel Meminger takes her rightful place alongside Anne Frank. And there's Rosa and Hans Hubermann, Rudy Steiner, the mayor's wife, and Max Vandenburg. Hans's accordion is almost a character itself. The first half of the book often moves slowly, but staying with it is rewarding. Narrated by Death, even Death is moved when required to collect some of these characters' souls. I can't recall the last time a writer's words brought me to tears, but the final few chapters were blurred reading.
0440237688|4.0|My 7th grade Reading teacher absolutely loved this book. I didn't get around to reading it until I was long out of middle school, but I'm very glad I did.    Technically, I believe this is children's fiction. However, it's very, very deep.     The story takes place in a utopian society where everyone has forgotten how to feel (which would be one of the wort things that could possibly happen to a human in my opinion). Each child, once they reach a certain age, will be assigned a job. There are medics, glorified babysitters, and so on. And then we have our main character, the Receiver. The Receiver is a very special person as he has to receive all the old memories of feelings and then pass them on to future generations.     There is a lot of depth in a short book. You honestly can't go wrong with this book. It's very good, albeit simple.

In Fight Club, a nameless narrator chronicles some of the very unusual that he experiences after having met a man named Tyler Durden. The narrator's house explodes, he ends up living with Tyler, fighting at bars, threatening to cut off the testicles of congressmen, and so on.

The cymbals are muted, the guitars are slicker with no growl, and it seems designed to lay Dave's vocals ahead of everything, but it doesn't rock. Are they trying to appeal to a group of people that are growing older that think can't tolerate the noise of rock music? I'll take the original recordings over these any day. I hate compression! I'm not too old to rock!!! Dave, I want you guys to blow my head off on the next record!!!
B00006G8HX|4.0|Right away, I will say that out of 5 stars, I expected a 4 star movie, and I got a 4 star movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it suffers from being between two epics: An epic of comedy (The Voyage Home) and an epic of tragedy (Wrath of Khan)<br /><br />I pointed out in my (NEW) Wrath of Khan review that Wrath of Khan was about Kirk, and the \\"maturation\\" he suffers by Spock's death.  Spock's death shows to Kirk for the first time that he is not invincible, and he has cheated death for so long, that the inevitable came, and did what Khan intended to do: hurt him and make him go on hurting: taking his closest friend from him.<br /><br />Unfortunately, you can't really continue the same Star Trek journeys without Spock.  A brilliant writer/director likely could, but it would have to be a genuinely BRILLIANT writer/director, and even then some fans would still whine and complain about Spock.<br /><br />So they have to bring him back.<br /><br />To their credit, they did a very good job of bringing Spock back without making it seem like a cheap \\"I got better\\" asspull excuse to bring him back to life.  The Genesis Planet brings Spock's body back to life, but without his mind, it is a nonsentient animal, confused and in pain, as it rapidly ages with the planet.  Teen!Spock has sex with Saavik to sate his Pon Farr, and the Klingons finally return to try to steal the Genesis Project secrets from Kirk.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd is magnificent as a Klingon.  And in terms of effectiveness, I have to say he's in some way better than Khan.  While Khan eventually caused Kirk to suffer the death of Spock, it was only after Khan had died, and indirect.  Christopher Lloyd's Klingon is cold, calculating, cunning, and brutal.  Such things he does and memorable lines include killing his gunner for accidentally destroying a Federation science vessel when he wanted it disabled because he wanted prisoners, or when he has Saavik and David prisoner on the Genesis Planet, he orders one of them killed, and says \\"I don't care which one\\".<br /><br />In fact, the Klingon seems to directly affect and hurt Kirk more than Khan did, at least in the short-term.  While Khan swerved and screwed Kirk several times, Kirk was always smugly in control of the situation and was a step ahead of Khan.<br /><br />This is the first time in the film that a villain gives pause to Kirk, and seriously hurts him while being alive to do so.  First, David is killed while struggling with a Klingon.  This news hits Kirk so hard, he falls to the ground in shock and anguish.<br /><br />And then of course, the Klingons' attempts to take the Enterprise force him to have it self-destruct.  Another hurt on him.<br /><br />But ultimately, because dollars and status quo and a great character's continuing adventures demand it, Spock must return.  Spock's \\"Remember\\" mind-meld with McCoy becomes central in this film, as they take Spock's body just as it conveniently ages to Nimoy's current age, and bring it to Vulcan, to \\"extract\\" his \\"Katra\\" or soul or whatever from McCoy and return it to Spock.  The ending is very touchingly heartwarming.<br /><br />But ultimately, because bluh bluh dee bluh mentioned above, Spock must return.  And while the movie is decent enough, it loses some points for its severe mood whiplash from the previous film, and the seeming long-term \\"lesson\\" and its effects---that being Kirk is not infallible or invincible---being ended, as even though Kirk hurt with the loss of his friend, he got better, and got Spock back eventually anyway.ich one\\".

The ending is very touchingly heartwarming.      But ultimately, because bluh bluh dee bluh mentioned above, Spock must return.  And while the movie is decent enough, it loses some points for its severe mood whiplash from the previous film, and the seeming long-term \\"lesson\\" and its effects---that being Kirk is not infallible or invincible---being ended, as even though Kirk hurt with the loss of his friend, he got better, and got Spock back eventually anyway.
0307269981|1.0|Ugh. Can't even get all the way through this book. I really enjoyed the first book, but this one is boring and dull, drowned in details and too many characters. I can't keep track of them all, nor do I really care to. After reading other reviews on Amazon to see if I should keep reading or not, I've decided not. Disappointing.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I loved this movie! It has a great story, and the acting is top-notch. You can really feel the tension. This movie is just plain amazing and if you don't like it there is something wrong with you.
B002UD56I6|4.0|I really enjoyed this. I was surprised by how Michael Jackson danced and moved well, very impressive - for a 50 year old guy remember - and looked healthy which makes it even sadder he passed away.<br />He sure didn't look like a guy who was \\"frail\\" or ill (as some UK media described him) or that his heart wasn't in it. In fact he looked better than he had for some years.<br />Some productions look as if they could have been crackers - for the example the 'Smooth Criminal' sequence was brilliant, with some very clever splicing putting MJ in a 40's gangster film (Rita Hayworth's 1946 film 'Gilda'), an updated 'Thriller' video and the moving 'Earth Song'. Also there were some good rehersal performances of 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It' etc. He also seemed clued up enough and knew what he was doing to direct his dancers and keep rhythm. I also read some reports or rumours that a double was used for some sequences but I didn't spot any, if one was used I can't see the join!<br /><br />It's an enjoyable yet frustrating (in the sense of \\"What if?\\") look at what his shows could have been like. It was interesting getting an insight into the production/videos. I'm sure the live shows would have been incredible!<br />In a curious way, this is one of the best and worst things. In presenting the MJ the fans/public want to see (understandably), it makes you think you never thought he'd die, but now he's gone - if that makes sense. In a sense, maybe the film fools us in the way Michael often fooled us.<br />But I think it was supposed to be celebrate him, and this is surely a must for fans to remember him by.<br />At the end, the audience in the cinema even applauded which isnt something you see very often.<br />I'm not even that big an MJ fan but can appreciate he was a pop legend and I enjoyed some of his music, he has made some very good music.<br />It would have been such a spectacle to see him in London.
B001FB55HQ|1.0|Blu-ray gets a 2 disc director's cut while dvd gets only a pos single disc with only the theatrical cut.  Getting tired of having some studios try to shove blu ray down my throat by withholding all good special features and added footage.   DVD is still the top selling format.  Wish they'd just give us the quality of discs we used to get.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|I had low expectations of the film after hearing some of the many disappointments.  But to my surprise, I found it very entertaining.  It was a fun and had great martial arts sequences, good action scenes and a nice sense of humor to it.  The story line for an action flick kept me attentive as well.  The plot moved along well and didn't feel like there were any slow moments.  I wasn't comparing it too hard to the original cartoon because it's a different time now and artists can have some creative liberty.  It was still fun to see some of the old familiar characters.  Great job with Snake Eyes.  Overall, good entertainment.
1439138311|3.0|I loved the idea of the book.  A irish imigrant comes to Brooklyn, sounds great.  And parts of this book are great.  At times I couldn't put it down. But much to my disapointment the end of the story was lack luster.  I was so bummed out by the boring ending.  I wouldn't read agian and would think twice about telling a friend to read it.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|This was a great action packed movie.<br />Can there be a more versatile actor today than Russell Crowe, especially when he's directed by the great Ridley Scott.

B001DJLCRC|4.0|It seems that the tragic hero is making a comeback, particularly in the realm of television. These characters are no more victims of fate than they are of their own actions, their greed, their mistakes. These characters live and breathe so many shades of grey we don't know whether we should be rooting for their triumph or eagerly awaiting their inevitable downfall. We love the character, but we hate ourselves for loving such an amoral being. It's confusing, it's morally uncomfortable, but it's a whole lot of fun.    Enter Bryan Cranston's brilliant portrayal of Walter White, the latest entry in the tragic hero tradition. Walter is a high school Chemistry teacher who is in dire financial straits. Walter's wife is pregnant, his son is handicapped, and Walter himself has just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and learned he has little time to live, and a fortune in medical bills that insurance won't cover. What's a man to do? Well, if you're Walter White, you use your chemistry expertise to get involved in the crystal meth business, in the hopes that when you leave this world, you leave behind some money to make sure your family is taken care of.    Preposterous? Sure. But it works, largely thanks to Cranston's stellar performance as White (which has earned him Best Actor Emmy wins for both of the show's seasons so far). Walter is a mess of a man--on one hand, he's the ultimate family man, doing whatever he can to hold his family together and make sure they can survive financially once he dies. On the other hand, he's being insanely selfish, putting at risk the lives of himself and his family and supporting what an extremely harmful underground drug trade. Cranston handles the role with great finesse, moving seamlessly from moments of despair as we watch a man dealing with the devastation of cancer, to moments of hilarity as we watch Walter cluelessly try to establish himself as a player in the drug business.    The first season of \\"Breaking Bad\\" clocks in at only 7 episodes, and is a great introduction to the show's zany, darkly comic world. The story flows smoothly, playing more like an extended movie than a television show, and makes for great TV on DVD. The show is not without its flaws--the story of Walter and his family is consistently compelling, but some of the side stories are not, and not all of the acting is as strong as Cranston's. In particular, Jesse, Walter's high-school dropout partner-in-crime, doesn't always rise to the bar set by Cranston, and his side stories at times leave you wanting only to get back to Walter's plot, but he also provides a comic foil to Walter's stoic seriousness and is an important inclusion to the show.    All in all, the first season of \\"Breaking Bad\\" is a wild ride featuring an outstanding lead performance and a dark, compelling story that carefully balances the poignant and the inane. What a refreshingly different series that ends with nothing but great promise for future seasons to come.
B002OEBMN4|4.0|Years ago Slayer produced three amazing heavy records collectively known as the Unholy Trilogy: Reign in Blood, South of Heaven and the near perfect Seasons in the Abyss. Unfortunately after those three gems Slayer has produced a bunch of uneven and often disappointing CDs beginning with the horrendous Divine Intervention and more recently with the putrid God Hates Us All. It seemed Slayer had abandoned any semblence of the melody and variety that made Seasons and South of Heaven such a thrill to listen to. Slayer seemed content to just play fast for the sake of playing fast with Tom Araya screaming away in his best Sam Kinneson imitation. Tempo changes and structural variations went nowhere and good ideas were abandoned simply to thrash away into chaos.<br />Fortunately World Painted Blood finds Slayer returning to the form that made them so great a couple of decades ago. World Painted Blood has diverse songs with tempo changes and Tom Araya varies his vocal style to keep things from becoming redundant. The songs are the strongest Slayer has written in years and the playing is as sharp and deadly has ever. There are even a couple songs with strong melody where Tom actually sings, shades of Spill the Blood. At least for awhile until he reverts to his Sam Kinneson scream. But all in all, a fine CD from Slayer and a compelling reason to believe that Slayer's Reign in Blood will continue for many years to come..<br /><br />Best Tracks: Beauty Through Order, World Painted Blood, Playing With Dolls, Human Strain, Psychopathy Red
0375703764|5.0|I have an odd relationship with this book. I'd read enough about it to interest me, and then requested it as a gift from my father. When he bought it, he flipped through it, and gave it to me, laughing. He had seen the strange formatting of the book: switching between colors and fonts, pages full of writing, pages with no writing, blocks of text that are backwards, sideways, upside-down. It was like no other book he'd ever seen--and I couldn't wait to dive in.    Well, I didn't make it through it the first time. Containing a bizarrely layered series of narratives partially written in a somewhat dry, academic voice, it requires more attention than I was able to give it at that point in my life, and I found myself barely inching through the book's 800 pages. Ultimately, I had to put it down, vowing to revisit it at a time when I could give the book the time and energy it deserved. A few weeks ago, I tried it again, and found it to be one of the best reading experiences I'd ever read in my life.    To describe the structure or the plot in any great detail would be futile, and were I to succeed, it would take away half the fun. All you need to know is that it's about a family moving into a new house where things aren't quite as they seem, and that it's format of the book is like nothing you've ever experienced. There are footnotes, letters, journal entries, appendices, that frequently have your eyes and fingers flying all over the place, fingers wedged to mark pages as you consult a reference, or flip back to a footnote, or whatever else the book demands of you. The process of reading that the book requires as is different and immersive an experience as the text itself.    But it's worth it. Ultimately, this book consumes you. Once you start reading it, it's hard to let go; even when you put it down, it permeates your thoughts. It's disturbing, it's scary, it's profound; in parts it's even funny and romantic. This book seems to flawlessly transcend genre and classification, and roots itself in your head and won't let go. Even after you've finished, you'll feel like there's so much more hidden in the book--codes, footnotes, references. You'll find your thoughts turning to it when you least expect it.     At least, that was my experience. \\"House of Leaves\\" is not a book for everyone. It doesn't tie up nicely, it doesn't even begin to answer all its questions (though upon deeper reflection, it may answer more than it seems to), and some may find reading such an unconventional book to be a chore. \\"House of Leaves\\" demands an entirely unique relationship with its reader--if you give yourself to this book, it can be an infinitely rewarding experience. It was a journey like none I've had with a book before, and doubt I will again. But, if you prefer a very straightforward reading experience, and are unwilling to try something this radical, I can certainly see where it would be a bit much for some readers.    I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone -- but for those who can handle something so different, so unabashedly experimental and out-there, and who have the patience and desire to surrender themselves to the book and to explore the secrets that lie within its hallways... well, then you're in for one hell of a ride.    Note: As others have mentioned, \\"Haunted\\" by Poe is meant to be a sort of companion album to the book, and is a great album that is definitely worth a listen during or after experiencing the book.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|I'm glad to own this album finally....I can't believe I didn't own it yet and I managed to find this great product at such an unbeatable price.    Everyone should own this!!!!! RIP J Yancey
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Becoming a \\"classic\\" horror movie is very difficult.  Mainly because each generation becomes more desensitized to violence, and more used to horror conventions.  As such, they come to expect the gore and monster jumping out of nowhere tactics.  This is why Phantasm's ability to achieve classic status, especially given its modest budget and production value is such a feat.  Unlike most, I did not see this movie until very recently, meaning I've seen a very large amount of horror flicks prior to this so did not expect to find anything new in an old low budget horror flick. How wrong I was.    Phantasm is a creepy, scary, psychological movie.  The movie is more interested in playing with your mind than with a body count, which is the way I prefer it.  There's an air of mystery throughout the movie, some of which is not resolved.  I liked that a horror movie, especially one from a few decades ago, found ways to surprise me and keep me on the edge of my seat.  Sure the effects and makeup is a bit dated, but that doesn't stop this from being a classic movie.  If you haven't seen this, I highly recommend giving it a chance.
B001YV504U|5.0|No, it's Iowa...What a classic movie, and it looks so much better in Blu-ray. Never gets old.
0061537969|5.0|I LOVED \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\"!! Yes and I am a dog lover, but the author made the book so much fun to read and hard to put down. I've been spreading the word about how good this book is and I am amazed at how many people have heard of it and loved it too! My book club gave it 13 out of 15 thumbs up. The other two votes were sideways thumbs, they still enjoyed the book. I hope our next book is as good!
B000NQRE0K|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. From the acting to the cinematography to the outstanding score, this is just a perfect film. I couldn't wait for it to be released on Blu-ray, and it completely lived up to the promise. Everything looks spectacular and the Blu-ray really enhanced my passion for watching the movie, something I didn't think was possible. If you own a Blu-ray and have Braveheart on DVD, you have to upgrade. So worth it.
0810983915|5.0|My niece loved this book as much as she loved all the others in the series.  She is 8 and not a fast reader.  So when she announced with pride she read the book in two days, that alone made the purchase worth it.  She would highly recommend the book as well as the series.
0307266303|5.0|Read a book about running? I love reading, but the thought of reading a running book to me is so boring. Yet this book was so highly rated by so many people, that as a runner over four decades, I decided to give it a try.    I was hooked from the beginning. The book is predominately a story from beginning to end, about the world's best runners that no one has ever heard of. The way they approach running makes a lot of sense logically. I've always wondered how my dad could run marathons in his thin Brooks running shoes, with virtually no padding or support. But now...I get it. Less is more. And I'm giving it a whirl, having recently bought a pair of Vibram Five Fingers shoes (sweet!). The first run I made (start with much shorter distances than you're used to) was amazing: fun and completely natural.    If you run/jog more than a few miles at a time, and are open to a new way of running (perhaps the *correct* way of running), take a chance on this book. And similar to me, you might start buying extra copies for running friends and family.
0060775858|4.0|Goodnight Moon is a classic for children.  The story is simple and the illustrations are beautiful, taking you and your child into a world of pure fantasy.  I am only disappointed that the book (purchased NEW) arrived with \\"scuff\\" marks.  It came in a package with 2 other books and they were fine.
B000002UC5|5.0|Paul is a genius and a musician's musician.  He actually beatboxes on \\"That Would Be Something\\" a good ten or fifteen years before anyone else would even think of doing it.  He played every instrument himself and taught his wife to sing back-up.  He beat a book for percussion on \\"The Lovely Linda.\\"  He used a leg of of his drum on a Stratocaster to simulate the sound of a steel guitar on \\"Man We Was Lonely.\\"  He played glasses full of water.  He shot a bow and arrow.  He started a fire in a studio -oops!  He took avante garde chances that even John and Yoko would have balked at.      It was his habit to turn to music in times of despair.  Had it not been for the tragic loss of his mother when he was fourteen, he may never have become the musical genius he is today.  He did the same thing after Brian's death- \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and \\"Fool On The Hill\\",  John's death- \\"Here Today\\" and Linda's illness- the \\"Flaming Pie\\" album, namely \\"Somedays\\", \\"Heaven on a Sunday\\" and \\"Calico Skies\\", all of which were influenced in one way or another by her and Hurricane Bob     He healed his deep emotional wounds left by the Beatles break-up with the music on McCartney, and for that reason alone this album is special.  If the others could have done that the way Paul did, maybe the break up wouldn't have been so bitchy.  Then, he took the ultimate leap when he admitted in the questionare that went out with the advance that the Beatles were over.  The others would have been content to lie about it forever.  Good for him.     I get irritated when people call this an album of outtakes.  Understand he recorded most of this stuff at home with crude equipment, no vu meter and only one mic.  Listen to it with that in mind.     Fans of bad movies can equate this album to Rocky working out in Siberia to prepare for the big fight in Rocky IV.  Yes, this album is rough and loaded with instrumentals.  But listen to it in the context of his career and you'll love it as much as I do.
0452289963|5.0|This book, to say the least, changed my life. I do not know where I would find myself today unless I read it, probably obsessed with my appearence and posessions,- simpy unhappy.  This book has allowed me to look through all the layers the ego adds to one's life and therefore forget the true meaning and beauty of it. Eckart Tolle points out the obvious, it is so obvious it has been completley disregarded by human kind. Since I have read this book I refer back to it every single day to live a more joyful life, no matter where I may find myself. My friends have read it or are reading it and they agree to the message, it changes lives no matter what your life may contain. I am only 17 years old, and my only regret is that I haven't read this book earlier, it would have saved me from a lot of unnecessary suffering that mostly imposed on myself, almost all pain is self created. I am currently urging everyone I love to read this book, even people I don't love! I gurantee that if someone reads this book and understands it's message they will live better life. There are countless books on how to behave to be happier, better, smarter etc, but this is the only one that goes deeper, and sticks, far beyond all the shallow changes people pursue.  If every single person read and understood the book's content I am positive that all misery would end, this may only make sense to you of you read it. But if I had enough money I would buy a truck load an give it out to everyone.    After reading this book and no longer have an excuse to be sad, and unless you want to be unhappy, I strongly encourage the world to read it.
B000PC6A3E|3.0|First, there is no Japanese language track and only Japanese or Chinese subtitles, not both.  (I'm not sure which subtitled language is listed because I don't read either language, but I suspect it's Chinese because some of the characters are much more complex than most Japanese characters.)<br /><br />Also, IF YOU OWN A SONY BLU-RAY PLAYER THIS DISC MAY NOT PLAY!  I sold a perfectly fine Batman Begins BD to a guy with a Sony player who fantasized that the disc was filthy or heat damaged, neither of which were true.  Only after he bought a 2nd BB BD and discovered that it, too, would not play in his Sony BD player did he realize the problem was his player, not because I was some sort of scheister, which I'm not.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />After the guy returned the disc to me it played (and is playing now) perfectly fine in my PS3.

0786838655|5.0|My daughter is 9 years old.  This is her review-  I LOVED the book!  Rick Riordan's writing style is great.  I would be interested in reading the other Percy Jackson and the Olympians books.  I never got tired of reading this book, and every part I loved.  I can't believe there is a movie coming out about this book! I wonder if it would be different than the book in any way(probably).
0385736002|5.0|I finally gave up my refusal to read the Harry Potter series and dove in nose first and was hooked on the genre. I found that I was hungry for more adventure and read the Percy Jackson series and became even more addicted! By the by, I've never tried drugs before but I guess when you're hooked... Anyway, I was looking for my next big read and came across the Nicholas Flamel series and have read the three books up until this point.  Can't wait until the next installment.  I need to find something else to occupy my mind until its release date. I've never been good at summarizing anything so I won't even try it. However, if you have a great appreciation for mythology and history then this is definitely a good read for you.  Oh yeah, just totally bypass the age range.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|We bought this for our 4 year old son, he has watched it before when he was younger, but this time round it is having so much more of an effect, i am glad we bought it - we don't have to \\"send it back\\"!
B00014NE62|5.0|I first read this book in the summer of 2003 and then had my boyfriend buy me the DVD for Valentine's Day 2004. I'm not sure how many times I've watched this movie since, but it's at least fifteen if not twenty. If, for the rest of my life, I were only allowed to watch five movies, this would be one of them. I never get bored with this movie because there are so many little details to notice and I find a new one almost every time. Every single element is well-done, from the acting to the sets to the costumes to the absolutely beautiful score.    I'm also impressed with the casting. James Wilby has the perfect blandly attractive look for Maurice, Forster's \\"ordinary\\" protagonist, but the pensieve emotion he puts into the character makes him anything but bland. Hugh Grant, in one of his early roles, displays the same ease in playing a sensitive snob that he has in some of his later films, but with none of the self-consciousness and manufactured charm that have marred much of his work over the last fifteen years or so. After a while I forgot it even was Hugh Grant. As for Rupert Graves, he inhabits his character with all the charm, roughness, and lack of inhibition required for Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper who proves to be Maurice's salvation. In the smaller roles, credit is due to Phoebe Nicholls, who plays Anne, Clive's wife, and Mark Tandy as Risley, Maurice and Clive's entertainingly pretentious friend from Cambridge.    \\"Maurice\\" is a sweepingly romantic film about a man altered by love, propelled by his overwhelming passion from a state of unthinking and uninspired existence to depths of emotion that cause him to question everything he thought he knew about his place in the world. When we first see Maurice as an adolescent boy, his life appears to be already planned for him; he will finish his current school, begin a new one, grow up to become an Edwardian gentleman, and marry an appropriate young lady. \\"I think I shan't marry,\\" the young Maurice tells his teacher, Mr Ducie, who laughs it off as one of those ridiculous things children say. And indeed, when we see the barely-adult Maurice at Cambridge, his early thoughts of societal rebellion appear to have gone nowhere; he's an unremarkable undergraduate whose attempts at insight sound more recited than believed. Contrast the dull and inarticulate Maurice having dinner with the Dean to the bold, clear-thinking, defiant man of the film's last few scenes and the contrast is extraordinary.    The DVD extras are entertaining; I particularly enjoyed Rupert Graves's comment that, after the release of the film, he received an abundance of fan mail from Japanese schoolgirls. The extras also offer a number of deleted scenes that will be of particular interest to viewers who have read the novel.
B0010358CQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  The graphics is incredible and so realistic!  I would recommend this movie to anyone
B000002V07|5.0|When this came out in the 90's it was a complete reveleation. This kind of freamy alternative rock was kind of unheard of; the strongest track remains Fade Into You with Hope sandoval's dreamy/druggy voice. Unfortunately this was and is so spectacular that they would never again produce anything close to it on further releases. Also the band seemed to come to a stop for a long time which was a shame. This, however is a classic.

0385339607|5.0|Gresham is at his best in this colorful tale of a young lawyer on the run from bill collectors, struggling to find a job out of law school and falling into the case that will make or break his career.    This is the only Gresham book that is written in the first person, and Gresham does a marvelous job in reflecting the protagonist's thoughts and emotions as he interacts with a variety of characters, from good-old-boy lawyers and their crony judges to the uneducated poor who are fodder for corporate rip-off artists to the various parasitical characters that live off of the legal system in some form or fashion. With a variety of sub-plots, the reader is not really sure which one will take center stage... and that is one of the beauties of this novel in that it reflects life's vagaries.     I was only lukewarm to Gresham's writing, until I read this book. If you're a Gresham fan, then read it. If you're not a Gresham fan, this book will change your mind. Highly recommended.
B002BFIN6K|3.0|I have some Rachmaninoff on 78 and all of it that was released on LP (although not every different LP version), the first release on CD of the complete recordings, plus several other CDs which release some other Rachmaninoff recordings not included in the \\"complete\\" sets (alternate takes of the Beethoven \\"Spring\\" sonata and the 1929 2nd concerto pre-war and post-war released takes, for example). And I have several versions of the piano rolls, including the complete on Telarc. I also have some bootlegs which released stuff not officially released, at the time, on LP or 78, and may possibly include material not released anywhere else; there are, for example, two different completed takes of the Chopin Ballad, and possibly the Scherzo, and I don't know if my bootleg release from the 1960's is the same pair of takes as the LP or CD release; I have heard, many years ago, both but don't have copies of both Ballad takes (and Scherzo?) and the bootleg doesn't specify the take. And there are 3 takes of each of the Edison releases: I have no Edison 78s and not all takes have been released on the \\"complete\\" editions. The Veritas edition doesn't specify takes, but some takes definitely have not been released commercially on LP or CD.  I waited a long time to buy this Zenph reperformance CD because of my disappointment that no SACD was released, hoping for an import SACD or a Blu-Ray disc version.  But neither has happenned.  I do have the two previous Zenph releases on SACD and highly recommend them.  A high definition surround sound download of this album is now available, but I haven't heard it--I like to own actual physical media.    This is an excellent sounding CD, but it falls a little flat and doesn't give me the experience of being in the presence of Rachmaninoff the way many of his original records on 78, LP, or CD do and even some of the piano rolls recordings.  Perhaps the lack of the high resolution recording, as on SACD, contributes, but perhaps it has something todo with the recording venue.  When Rachmaninoff recorded the records reperformed on this CD, and especially those recordings from the 1920s and 1930s, he was recording mostly in small, acoustically kind of dead studios, and he undoubtedly adjusted his playing to suit the room in which he was recording so that it sounded good to him, there.  I suspect that the Zenph analysis of his keystrokes, dynamics, application of peddle, etc, are as accurate as the analysis of Glenn Gould and Art Tatum's playing on the other SACDs, though Rachmaninoff's playing was undoubtedly more complex than Gould or Tatum's.  But then, Rachmaninoff's small dead room keystrokes are reperformed in a medium size concert hall, if the pictures are to be believed; and Rachmaninoff would not have used the same keystrokes and peddling in that larger more lively room.  Perhaps if this data set were re-recorded in a medium sized living room (which wouldn't even have to be as dead as the 1920s recording studio) with the same 1909 Steinway, it might sound a LOT more like Rachmaninoff was playing there.  Perhaps such a recording (with video even) and with a few more solo works added could be released on Blu ray.  I would love to hear that and would buy it in an instant.  But this is a real disappointment coming after Gould and Tatum.
0240810961|5.0|Stanchfield's voice is so clear in his writing, you get the sense of his passion for the art, and his desire to teach and inspire the next generation of animators as if you were one of his students. His writing ranges the philosophical discussion of what it means to be an artist (animator) and it's place in society, to very specific instruction on what to draw and why. You should read this. Animators in any style should read this.
B0025KVLU6|2.0|Well, I received my shipment of the Beatles Remastered White Album CD, and thoroughly enjoyed CD1.  The songs had a lot of new life to them, and sound really great.  HOWEVER, either my CD2 is defective, or I am simply missing something.  After inserting the CD in my computer, the Documentary video starts up and runs fine.  The Credits video runs fine.  BUT I can never find any songs on the CD, even though they are listed on the label.  I did a Windows Explorer check on CD2, and there are no audio files of any type showing up, even though the audio files for CD1 show up when I check that CD.  What is going on?  Anyone have any ideas, or do I just send the shipment back?  By the way, this is the second shipment, since I sent the first one back for the same reason.
B0017HEX76|4.0|Knowing the film is in Korean with the ability of English  helped.  I would have given it 5 stars except it is not that easy to get the english version up.<br />It takes a bit of trial and error and guessing the first few times then I wrote the instructions down.<br />Using the remote was easier than the buttons on my machine.  The big problem is the first screen you get is all in Korean and you have to guess what the three choices are.  I think it was the middle choice that got you to the language menu.<br />You have to reset it each time.<br />Other than that - it is fine.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|i was doubtful at first. but this animated series is for starwars fans only, and its a must. i love it
B00003CXBK|5.0|To appreciate how exceptional 'Princess Mononoke' is, just try to imagine Disney doing something like this. Imagine how overbearing and preachy its message would be, or how sickly cute and perfect they would make San, or how the owner of the ironworks would be a ruthless, ugly, rich old guy. In contrast, `Mononoke' is a thought-provoking film that refuses to settle for easy answers, and contains very complex and well-drawn characters.     One thing to note is that this is quite adult-oriented compared to some Miyazaki films such as `Kiki' or `Totoro'. Although there's nothing gratuitous, there is a surprising amount of violence, and some mature themes. That apart, this film explores typical Miyazaki themes; including environmentalism, alternate history, Japanese mythology, and feminism. And like all Miyazaki films, `Mononoke' is superbly drawn and animated, incorporating some fairly subtle CG effects for the first time. In the original Japanese, the voice acting is universally excellent. (Although people have problems with some performances in the English dub, I can't comment as I always watch anime in its original language).    For the characterisation, the movie aggressively turns history on its head by having strong, capable women in powerful positions (even if Ashitaka is cast as the traditional `hero').  Lady Eboshi especially is a fascinating character, as she is a genuine antagonist. Her position puts her in direct conflict with Ashitaka and San not because she is evil, but simply because her needs clash with theirs. San herself is extremely aggressive for a heroine, and the various forest animals are even more ruthless and determined. The film constantly blurs the line between protagonist and antagonist; Eboshi destroys the forest but provides work and shelter for social outcasts, San and Moro defend the forest creatures but resort to violence to do so.  There is no `right' and `wrong' in this movie, just competing agendas. Such depth and thoughtfulness is welcome, and is one reason why I consider Japanese animation to be above its American counterpart.    If I had to make one criticism of this film, it's that there might be one too many competing agendas. We have Ashitaka and his quest, San, Eboshi and the ironworks, Moro and the wolves, the boars, the monkeys, the forest gods, Jigo, and the Emperor's mercenaries. There is an awful lot happening in this movie, and the various alliances and battles do require some concentration to follow. This alone means `Mononoke' is more suited to an adolescent/adult audience than for children. The pacing and storytelling is perfect, though, meaning the movie is not really difficult to fully appreciate or understand, provided you put in a little effort.     In my opinion, `Princess Mononoke' is Miyazaki's best film, and that's saying something. Outstanding animation, well-drawn characters, intricate plot, and some thought-provoking themes, all presented in a more mature and complex style. An amazing piece of work, and one of the best anime ever made.     Five stars all the way.
B0001I55OC|4.0|I read Crichten's book and loved it so I wanted to see the movie.  It was fun and mixed action, history, romance, and suspense.  As far as I am concerned, Gerard Butler carries every movie he is in and I liked Claire and Donniger.  Paul Walker is cute, but not a terrific actor.  In addition, there were several historical mistakes made (modern historians and scientists don't know the actual \\"recipe\\" for Greek Fire, among other errors).  But if you are able to file up a large amount of \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" then this movie is pleasant and fun.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|We have all of Michael Buble's CDs and this may just be the best of the lot. Orchestration itself on the Cd is fabulous, as well as his vocal stylings.
B002O4J4DO|5.0|I purchased this locally. Sound quality is excellent. Most of the songs are presented in the mono mix. To me that is a treat! I have not watched the DVD clips yet. Reasonably priced. CCR were the masters of the under 3:00 minute classic track.
B000F7CMRW|3.0|I have to admit this was far too artsy a production for me. None of the characters were sufficiently defined to care about, none of the action sufficiently comprehensible to break through the torpor induced by the cross-cutting of scenes and characters. The cynicism which was the hallmark of fine cold war films, was marked, but I was led to indifference  since it was all puppetry devoid of human characteristics. I shouldn't think any blame accrues to the actors whose playing seemed to be in tune with the desires of writers and the director; George Clooney, in particular, is to be congratulated for his heroic underplaying which dimmed his impact to near zero.   Over-all, it was quite an achievement to convert a hot issue into a bedtime story.
B000022TSH|5.0|Melancholy movie plot; very worth watching; those who \\"love to hate\\" rich interfering daddies and politicians versus the good guys will enjoy.  Get out the kleenex box for the ending!!     Great Jack Nicholson acting AGAIN
B002L3D1GY|5.0|One of my ever favourites by King.  The Running Man short novella here is nothing like the movie.  Although I did like the movie, this short story is much better, and very different.<br />If you're a King fan, you won't be disappointed.  Spend the money.  Grab some snacks. Get a warm blanket.  You'll be up til the wee hours.  You won't be able to put it down.  Remember \\"Rage\\" was written long before you ever heard of the violence on school campuses today.  The Long Walk I have read several times.  Roadwork is another story that's hard to believe how long ago it was written.  This is really early stuff, but King could have easily written this is the past decade.  These stories are less 'bizarre' and more realistic than other works.  Some of King's best work, ever.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is the one show I don't get sick of. I've seen all the episodes of both season 1 & 2 about 4 times already! It is just full of funny situations and geeky comments! you gotta love it
B00006CXSS|5.0|i originally started watching this series on TV but missed several episodes.  When I saw that it had been released on DVD I was anxious to catch up on what I had missed.  This is one of the best depictions of WW2.  The characters are so well drawn out I feel like I might have actually known them.  I laughed, cheered and cried all the way through. The 101st Airborn Easy Co. was a brave group of men who helped save this country and me, a little girl of less than 3 years of age.  God bless America.
0756405890|5.0|Just bought this book today, deliverd to me superclass mail by a \\"freind\\"  This sodding book has kept me up till 3.30am.  I have a list now of things BAD ohh so BAD about TNOTW  ------------------------------------------------------  1/HEADACHE  2/Just having finished im on a HIGH,sleeppppy  3/I hate doing this  \\"my review\\".    Cant believe there are so many 1 stars, so i had to have a peek.  Thing about Trilogies in general they are more than 1 book long and hard to let slip that its a begining ;)  Kvothe is not easy to understand, its a big book, read it in less time since, since,,,,,pfff oh! Joe Abercrombies gems. He is smart, and the reasons for them are PLAIN to see in how he was curious from the start kind of embedded in him from the get go.I cannot see how anyone apart from trolls can mark this book a 1. a 1. backed up by drivel as far as i could make out. Its amazingly well TOLD this NEW way of writing, his amazing powers that spring from nowhere?? had a friend who was like that. Love those types of folk, real quick to pick up, also do yourselfs a favour, buy this book if you are a serious reader only, you will be doing as little work as possible, unputdownable:) other 5 stars in here sum up most points why this is special, 20 odd 1s, its petty, pretty, petty;)
0451169514|3.0|Despite my initial surprise in finding that Stephen King's writing was not that of many popular contemporary writers I am beginning to wonder why everyone loves his stories.  I enjoy Kings' writing, full of rich detail and great word choice but the two novels that I've read haven't had the gripping plots I was expecting.  Though IT was very unique in many ways the novel became so strange that I often found myself wondering what King was talking about.<br /><br />I found King's combination of flashbacks and present day events as the story progressed to be fascinating.  Though it was sometimes confusing I enjoyed the structure of the novel.  Moving between the Loser's childhoods and their adult lives made the novel much more interesting, presenting the reader with two similar but also separate plot lines.  King seamlessly melts past and present by beginning a sentence in the presents and finishing it in the past.  IT had a very unique layout of text that I found entertaining to read.<br /><br />While the plot may have begun as something compelling, after 1090 pages I was certainly ready to close the book.  The different descriptions of events began to grow tedious and I found myself wondering when the book would finally end.  When the end did come I was thoroughly confused by the origin of Pennywise/IT as well as the meaning of the \\"macroverse\\" the \\"turtle and the \\"deadlights\\".<br /><br />IT provided many interesting plot turns and I often found myself unable to put it down.  However, the novel was simply too long.  I am a person who enjoys reading long books but I found that the bulk of IT was nothing more than unnecessary and often tedious fluff.  Many readers would find IT entertaining but you must be willing to invest the time and patience necessary to finish this sprawling coming of age horror.
B002H3F7F6|2.0|Sting lives up to his reputation for exploring unexpected material in his post-Police days. I like the material.    And I wanted to like the recording soooo bad. I expected stunning sound quality, especially since this release is on Deutsche Grammophon. I have a bass-shy, vividly detailed fledgling audiophile sound system. The mid-bass on this recording sounds bloated and completely overwhelms the mids and highs. The miking is also especially poor. Couldn't they place the ensemble in a live acoustic space and get decent imaging and reverb? This sounds so studio-ish it's a shame.    I gave this disc one tormented listen and probably won't revisit it very often.    Props to Sting for the selection of material and musicians. Shame on the production crew and DG for this sonic atrocity.
0316518565|4.0|A probably slightly biased book seeing as it is about Nick Leeson and is written by Nick Leeson.<br /><br />Someone who works for Leeson makes a costly mistake and this, we're led to believe, is the catalyst for the downfall of one of the world's oldest banks. Leeson, we're told, gets sucked into making bigger and bigger gambles with derivatives, a still not very well undertood part of the financial sector and, of course, the rest we know.<br /><br />Leeson comes over as greedy, as do his superiors at Barings. As long as he was claiming to make money, they were fine with whatever he was doing, not that they knew what he was doing.<br /><br />A very interesting yet somewhat flawed book.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|When I first heard Neon Bible, I wanted another Funeral.  This is not another Funeral.  Rather, this is a more mature, darker sound which, upon repeated listens, has grown incredibly on me.  Had this been my introduction to Arcade Fire, I'd be just as in love with them as I was after hearing Funeral.
1594132666|5.0|Received this book as a gift and it was recommended by several girl friends.  Absolutely loved this book!  The author successfully touches on feelings and thoughts that all normal women seem to have at various times in our lives.  And the changes and lessons learned we all go through as well.  Recommend it to all women - all my sisters!
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael Buble has done it again.  He has taken the old standards and made them his.  He is always able to add his special touches to songs and make them his very own.  My favorite song off of the Crazy Love CD is \\"Cry Me a River\\".  The musical arrangements add to the songs on this CD.  Michael seems to broadening his scope.  As always he sounds great.  Crazy Love is a nice way to kick back and relax.
1416594787|4.0|While I think that Dawkins has done a good job in this book of laying out the case for evolution, I was not completely satisfied when I reached the end. A lot of the information is really just introductory. He seems to selectively decide when he should get into more or less detail based purely on his own intuition, which sometimes makes for a frustrating circumstance where he spends too much time explaining something already familiar, and not enough explaining something really complex. Also, the frequent tosses to his other books were quite annoying. He could have spent some time explaining those concepts on their own. I'm a college student, and I don't have much time to go reading through Ancestor's Tale or Blind Watchmaker looking for information that should have been included in the Greatest Show on Earth.<br /><br />At the end of the day, though, in spite of its minor flaws, it is a great book. It is a must read for anyone who doubts evolution. There is so much evidence, from the fossil record to biogeography to genetics, that evolution really is, as Dawkins likes to say, \\"the only game in town.\\"  It is pathetic that in 2009, there exists a need for such a book.
0307408833|2.0|After hearing about this book online I was very excited to try my hand at some vegan, gluten-free baking.  I had no problem finding all the ingredients at my local natural market co-op, PCC.  Yes, some of the ingredients were expensive but I was willing to give it a go.  I tried out the pumpkin-spice muffins to horrible results, twice.  As Ms. McKenna suggests I followed her instructions to the letter.  No where in her entire book does it talk about coconut oil being solid at room temperature so the first time I made the muffins I did not melt the coconut oil down into a liquid.  This left a lumpy mess in the bowl but I proceeded as best I could hoping it would turn out after baking.  NOPE!  The second time I tried it I did melt the coconut oil down and was having high expectations that this time it would turn out.  After baking the muffins for even an extra hour they still did not pass the toothpick test.  Both my husband and I are experienced bakers and do not have this problem with other recipes.  This book is going back to the bookstore.  Maybe someone else has the time and the money to spend to adjust the ingredients and instructions to make these recipes turn out right but I don't.  If anyone has any other good recommendations for gluten-free baking cookbooks I would certainly be interested!
B002RHGYOA|5.0|Great book. I loved this story. Larsson weaves the backstory in a way that creates plausible tension and conflict. Don't miss this book.
B001S55X0I|5.0|There are certain movies that stand out on the holidays.  This is not one of them.  It probably should be.  You will find that many of the Python crew plays many different characters in the movie.<br /><br />Now the truth can be told.  It all starts with three wise men delivering gifts to young Brian.  Oops they correct their mistake.  Later, Judea, 33 A.D., on a Saturday afternoon, once again Brian (Graham Chapman) is a tad far down the mount when they hear what sounds as &quot;blessed are the cheese makers&quot; (it's not meant to be taken literally that could mean any manufacturer).  That is where Brian first sees Judith (Sue Jones.)  Later he shall be involved in the People's Front of Judea.  Later still he will be mistaken for the messiah (it is a logical mistake).  Two factions fight over who owns the messiah (the Shoe Followers and Gourd Followers.)<br /><br />You will recognize many of your favorite vices and verses.  One of the highlights of the story is the speech given by Pilate and Biggus Dickus.<br />As with most complex movies you will find the one you are looking for Python comedy, fanatic parody, or if you wish a deeper meaning.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this movie the next on your list should be &quot;Wholly Moses&quot; (1983) with Dudley Moore and Laraine Newman.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I will always treasure this CD, along with every other album I own by the one and only King of Pop, Michael Jackson.  He was a constant inspiration to me, not just with his music, but with the way he lived his life.  It doesn't matter that disc one is mostly greatest hits, with one new song.  I bought Number Ones when it only had two songs I didn't own (Ben Live and One More Chance) and that was when he was still on this earth.  Plus, disc two....Oh what can I say about disc 2.  She's Out of My Life demo, I like this better than the finished version.  Just Michael's voice and one instrument.  Who could ask for anything more.  I haven't heard his voice so clearly since \\"Speechless\\" (which might just be the most beautiful song ever written).  Finally, there is \\"Planet Earth.\\"  I've owned Dancing the Dream:  Poems and Reflections by Michael Jackson for a few years now and I dearly treasure it.  It lets me see the heart of a man who has always been my hero.  And to hear one of those poems read by the man himself.  I couldn't love anything more.  After listening to it, I had to go outside and feel the breeze caressing my skin and the sun on my face.  I looked at the grass and wanted to feel it between my fingers.  He really reminds us how precious our planet really is.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan or who wants to know more about this amazingly talented, bright, and caring man.  We'll never see his like again.  But, as Kenny Ortega added to the end of the movie, \\"Love Lives Forever.\\"
1594488878|5.0|I devoured this novel on a plane ride from California (I was actually cranky that the plane landed before I could read the last 20 pages!). Nick Hornby is always a fun read, and this book is no exception: quirky characters, inventive situations, and great plot twists. Not the most literary book, but great for the beach, a long flight, or to amuse you before turning out the light. And like many Nick Hornby novels, strangely emotional. Beneath his sarcastic exterior, Nick's actually a softy sentimentalist.
044654146X|5.0|This is an enjoyable read that highlights how Israel has come to become such a leader in high tech startups. It is quick, light reading that explores the historical and cultural aspects that lead so many Israelis to pursue entrepreneurship.     In Israel, it seems, there is a culture that embraces the questioning of authority, a flat hierarchical structure across society, and risk seeking behavior. For those who have traveled to Israel, these notions will not be unfamiliar to you. Furthermore, the book explores how the contacts made during mandatory army service serve as valuable social networking tools later on.    The book was exactly was I was hoping for. It is written for the layperson, and did not read like an academic journal. While most books about Israel focus on its conflict with the Palestinians, this book only brought up politics and conflict as it pertained to the subject at hand, and didn't editorialize in the process. Furthermore, the multitude of stories and vignettes made it a engaging read that held my interest for the time I sat reading it.
0618164413|5.0|My son (4) loves curious george. It is a great book and a good price
B002MW50KO|2.0|I love all kinds of Christmas music:  the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Nothing beats listening to \\"Star Wars Christmas\\" with all its cheese.  No mistake:  you can be a Dylan fan and not like this CD.  It's like watching a great baseball hitter whiffing on a fastball.  It is so bad it's funny.  I played it for my son, and he thought it was someone parodying Dylan-it's that bad.  As others have said, I'm glad Bob is giving the proceeds to the hungry.  But, he could have spared us all the pain and made his own gift.  Though, I will have a good chuckle listening to him cackle \\"Little Drummer Boy.\\"

B000AP04MO|5.0|This movie \\"Two for the Road\\" has been a favorite of mine since it came out. It is a little different to watch as it is filmed as they do often in France, going back and forth with sequences which can be a bit confusing. Neverless, it is really a wonderful, fun movie. Audrey Hepburn is delightful as always and Albert Finney is very good,too. Their love story when they first find each other is passionate and continues to be although they have the usual problems after they are married. I would reccomment it to anyone.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is a fine addition to your gaming rig. It is identical to the one that comes with your PS3 system. I have tried off-brand ones and they feel cheap and kind of flimsy when playing with them. I recommend buying the Sony one because it feels \\"right\\". Sofar we have put hundreds of gaming hours on this controller and have yet to see it misfire once. I also recommend buying the [[ASIN:B001H4NMNA Playstation 3 Energizer Power & Play Charging System]]. The price for the charger is really cheap and holds 2 of these controllers.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />>> OEM feel and function<br />>> Wireless controller with the PS3<br /><br />Cons:<br />>> Some wear noted around the L3 and L2 joystick (maybe lube with graphite dust).<br /><br />All in all a fine addition to your PS3.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

1401307957|2.0|I'm glad I got this little book from the library and didn't paid for it.   I often woundered how people without God make it though trauma and tradigy.  Well, Danny Gregory is one.  I acknowledge in this journie he trained his artistic eye to see and grew in drawing skill.   Unfortunately, the book dosen't show the first attempts, how he learned perspective, shadow and finally the use of color, you don't really SEE the process and progress.      The information I wanted was what art matterials he tried, what did he like, or didn't work for him.  The only indication of material was on the front cover.     Definitely, not a how to book on drawing. There were no new insights or revelations for me.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The best album I have ever owned. It went 19x platinum! While My Guitar Gently Weeps is one of my personal favorites. Some of the second disc's songs get to be a little uneven, however. Revolution 1, for instance, you don't at all need if you have Revolution. Revolution 9 is not a song. Yer Blues is also pretty bad. But with all the great songs, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Blackbird, Back in the U.S.S.R., Helter Skelter, and most of the rest, it is completely made up for.
B002NPUCP8|2.0|I looked forward to her album.  The hype was there...Santana.  Bought it,ituned it, deleted all but one song.  \\"Highly Strung\\" demonstrates Oriantha's talent; the rest was \\"Hart-redone\\" or some other FM noise.    Who tells these kids that their songs must have words?  Such inane lyrics drowning out such talent!  You know, I don't care if she wrote them or not.  Her talent is playing the guitar.  She can join the great guitarists, like Morse, Mclaughlin,...  Or she can become the intro band for others.        I would rebuy this album, if the lyrics were gone and it concentrated on the amazing talents of this young guitarist.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|Anyone who appreciates GI Joe as a Real American Hero need not waste any time with this politically correct garbage.    Not only did they forcibly remove the American theme from this respected icon and childhood toy, they also radically altered the characters from the line.    Because Bonaventura is an Obama fanatic, one cannot seriously expect anything patriotic from the \\"blame America first\\" crowd.  They totally botch the origins of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, and they refuse to provide anything interesting in terms of storyline.    Since when were Duke and Baroness supposed to get married?  Duke is Scarlett's man on the cartoon show.    The CGI is terrible, and so is the acting.      Not only is this stupid film a 300 million dollar box office bomb, it is a complete and total waste of your time!
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Gerald Butler's performance is excellent and the score music was great sound. The video quality on Blue-ray is outstanding.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|Michael Buble has an amazing voice to begin with.  The sort of silky smooth tones that make us ladies swoon.  He executes melodies perfectly, and his arrangements and interpretaions are excellent.  Michael Buble's interpretations are both faithful to the original, and at the same time new and innovative.    But even with all of that in his favor I was shocked at my husbands reaction.  He groaned as usual when I put the CD in the player.  He really isn't into this kind of music, and figured he was in for another chick love song fest, which he puts up with because he loves me.  But the first song hooked him, and by the third song he commented that \\"this guy ain't bad.\\"  That is high praise coming from my husband.  He actually listenned to the entire CD and was quite impressed.  My husband also really hates it when a new(er) artist sings an old song, but he loved Michael Buble's versions of some classic favorites.    All in all Michael Buble has another hit CD on his hands and is sure to win awards and acclaim.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I had heard just a couple of Michael Buble's songs before but never had a CD. I'm glad I have this CD now. I love it! There is a variety of sounds throughout. I love to be able to sing along with my music...especially in the van...and I am easily able to do so with this album. It turned out I was familiar with some songs and sang right along, and others were easily learned. If you like all types of music...like I do...you will love this! I recommend it for anyone! The kids are even loving it. They request a certain \\"Track #\\" since that's how they see it in the van. :)
B00004TJKI|2.0|Anatomy of a Murder is an interesting period piece, however I was stunned to learn that the period in question was 1959. The sexist attitudes in the film literally made me feel ill. The most stunning moment is when the entire courtroom brakes into full-throated laughter at the mention of the \\"panties\\" that are missing evidence in the alleged rape.<br />This movie does not stand the test of time. It seems like an overly long endorsement of those ancient falsehoods that good women don't get raped and bad women lie about it. Beyond that, the courtroom antics are a bit over the top and the judge unbelievabley lenient about it all.
B000FA5QS6|2.0|I won't add to the other positive comments about this book. It's wonderfully written. But the formatting on Kindle is deployable. In particular, the paragraphs breaks are hard to discern, making it difficult to know who is speaking.I hope the publisher will update the book to make it a better Kindle read.
B001LRJH0U|3.0|In this movie Virgil Cole is a lawman for hire<br />with his companion , Everett Hitch,who carries an 8 gage shotgun.<br />They are hired to pacify the town of Appaloosa.<br />The rich influential Bragg has killed the previous Marshal and his deputies.<br />When a widow woman enters the picture, things get more complex.<br />A witness comes forward and Bragg is arrested and tried, but escapes<br />twice on the way to trial<br />and finally is pardoned by his friend President Chester A. Arthur.<br />In Appaloosa things go from bad to worse until a strange conclusion.<br />This acting is good, but the plot is just kind of basic.<br />The characterizations are kind of one dimensional, so that<br />the macho sort of drowns out the feelings that you probably should have for them?
B0013K1ALE|4.0|For Zeppelin fans a review is unnecessary.  For those just discovering the band here's what you need to know.  Should you see it?  Definitely.  Should you buy it?  Depends.  It helps to know the studio versions first since many of the songs from the concert use the studio version as a jumping off point for long sonic explorations and solos.   The high points:  The music is very good and has aged quite well in my opinion.  I also enjoyed the backstage scenes and the segments of the various goings on with the fans, the band, and the crew members. The scene where manager Peter Grant confronting the venue manager over a man selling pirated photos of the band comes to mind, or the garage scene where security lets in a group of surprised and appreciative fans that don't have tickets.  These are very reminiscent of scenes from The Grateful Dead Movie and offer a wider perspective of the whole concert experience.   What does not work... are the fantasy scenes of each band member played against the backdrop of songs associated with them.  To be blunt they are dated and cheesy.  And so are their outfits, but that can be more easily forgiven.  It was the early seventies!  And last but not least, the sound it good and the video is surprisingly clear and clean for a show that was shot over thirty-five years ago.   All in all, if you find yourself liking this band and their music, this film is required viewing.

I strongly recommend any C++ book written by Myers (I have read several and loved them all).
0765350386|5.0|Brandon Sanderson knocked it out of the park with this book.  Riveting and compelling from the first page, we have a layered and complex action adventure tale that will captivate any reader.  I particularly appreciate how much of the story was advanced via balls and social interaction; the intrigue nicely balanced out the battle scenes.  Sanderson's magic system is intriguing, his characterizations are complex, and overall, it was a completely enjoyable book.  Strongly recommended!
1604590483|5.0|Ok, call me crazy but I started applying these principles and WOW! Believe me, I've always been a rigid cynical person but part of my path is to learn how to instill the magic ingredient into my life; FAITH. This book as well as \\"The Magic of Believing\\" has opened that amazing door for me. I applied these simple concepts to my life and I am no longer flat footed for one example. That's right the power of God flowing through my subconscious put arches in my feet after nearly 40 years.<br /><br /> You may see some negative reviews on this and \\"The Magic of Believing\\" and all I can tell you is they are absolutely correct. Yes I said CORRECT! Why? Because as Jesus said \\"According to your faith it is done for you!\\" Therefore if they believe it's not going to work then they are 100% right; it won't work. If that's you then you would be better off spending your money on a pack of cigarettes. If you want to explore your faith then these two books are a must have.
B001PR0YDA|4.0|Jim Carrey voices Scrooge in Robert Zemeckis' version of a Christmas Carol. You know the story, he's mean and self-centered and on Christmas eve he's visited by 3 ghosts. But this version is still very worth seeing due to the great animation and the fine work by Jim Carrey.<br /><br />  I expected Jim Carrey to be extremely annoying voicing Scrooge, as well as playing the 3 spirits. He's pretty restrained though and that's good since he gives his best performances when he's not over-acting. Zemeckis is good at making this kind of movie but he's too good to just make animated movies. I'm hoping that his next is a live action film. I mean, this is the guy that made Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Romancing the Stone and Forrest Gump. Still, he deserves one of his animated movies to be nominated for best animated film and this one deserves it the most.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I don't know why so many people are hating on this movie. Okay, so its not the best story, or acting. But it is still good. The story in my opinion has more depth than the Transformers Revenge of the Fallen story. This movie is just a fun movie, and is a bit corny at times. But it is still a good, fun movie. If your a fan of action movies, then you will probably like this movie. So give it a chance.
0060254920|5.0|This was a family favorite growing up. When the movie began to surface I discovered my husband had never even heard of it. So I promptly purchased this book for him and our son. He is now a bigger fan that I. Enjoy this lovely story of a very imaginative boy with a talent for trouble. It will become your family's favorite bed time story as well.
B001GCUNWQ|2.0|I found this movie beautiful and boring.<br /><br />Spoilers below!<br /><br />The weasel character was an obvious rehash of Crocodile Dundee.  Has it been so long that nobody recognizes that?<br /><br />The eventual relationship between the mother T-Rex and Sid reminded me of the dragon that falls in love with Donkey during Shrek.<br /><br />I never thought for a moment that anything bad would really happen to Sid, so the suspense turned out to be how many big dinosaur feet the characters would dodge on the way to his inevitable rescue.<br /><br />Diego has devolved into a boring selfish middle-aged sabre toothed tiger that doesn't want to find a mate, or get motivated to do anything unless disaster strikes.  I'll resist the obvious joke that he's grown rather long in the tooth.  Nope, I couldn't resist, actually.<br /><br />Addng a love interest for Scratt was the most original thing I saw happen in this movie.  Scratt grew the most of any character in the movie.<br /><br />So, if you want to see your lovable Ice Age characters do goofy fun stuff and not get smooshed under a dinosaur foot, this is the movie for you.  Or, if you want to see all the new ways to fail to get a nut, you'll have fun here.  If you expect anything more, you might find yourself waiting for it to end.
0679847367|5.0|As a former bookstore manager, I am well aware of the popularity of this book as a graduation gift. A few months ago, a lady from my MOPS group told us about this idea. Buy the book near your child's birth and put it away. As your child grows and develops relationships with family, friends, teachers and coaches...have these people write words of inspiration within the books cover. This makes the gift upon graduation so much more meaningful and memorable.

B001FB55MG|4.0|It is a good family friendly flick, and one wouldn't have to hesitate to let their kids see it.  Kids would find it pretty funny and my kids were laughing through the whole thing.  I enjoyed the film.....it was cute and somewhat funny.  I think Adam Sandler was alright, and he was his usual self but with family friendly humor.  I didn't think Kerri Russell was all that great in this flick, and Courtney Cox, I think, was channeling a little bit of Monica from Friends in this film, but it worked.  But my favorite character in the film?  Bugsy.  That big eyed family pet was hilarious!<br />If you're looking for a family friendly film this is definitely one!
0143038419|2.0|this novel was given me to read by a friend who lives in Bali. It has had its' share of bad reviews, and I am afraid, I'm going to add another. Although she writes reasonably well, I found that the main effect of this book was to make me want to give this woman a slap! She was 'happily married' and had a husband and a dog. Fair enough. The marriage broke up, also fair enough, but she casts herself as the good guy by giving the ex all her money. Not once does she mention the dog! It may seem a little thing, but it sets the tone for the book as she swans around, first, Italy, where she eats a lot and learns Italian. This was the best part of the book actually. Then onto India, where people only merit a mention if they are in some way 'spiritual'. Never mind the worse than grinding poverty, our plucky, adventurous lady writer isn't actually going to dirty her hands. Though she did wash a floor once...sigh! Why can't these writers ever connect with God in their own city? And so, onto Indonesia, where she finds love. Not hard to do over there, where new agers flock like mosquitos and are usually white, European and loaded. they also usually get chronically ripped off by the locals, but that doesn't make for an exotic story... I have the feeling that this book is going to - if it hasn't already - generate a million dollar industry in lectures and workshops on how to 'eat, pray, love.' Spiritual - not.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Watched this movie last night and have to say I really enjoyed it.  It was laugh out loud funny.  Reynolds and Bullock worked pretty well together in this film as far as the playful bickering went (I'm finding myself a bigger fan of Reynolds now) and Betty White, as always, was entertaining.  But it was missing something and I feel it was lacking a bit on the romantic side.  That was really the only thing I was disappointed in, was that I wasn't totally convinced at the end of the movie that either one of them had fallen for each other.  It still seemed like a business deal between them.  And Sandra Bullocks eyes bothered me in this film.  They just didn't look right for some reason.<br />But overall it was a cute funny RomCom and if one likes that kind of film then one would probably like this movie.
1442973587|5.0|The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is a wonderful little book.  My favorite thing about this book is that Dr. Chopra says so much in so few words and yet it is very easy to understand.  There have been so many books written on the keys to success.  This one gives one a different perspective on not only what is success, but how to go about being successful.  At the very start of the book, he suggests that success is not based on hard work and posits the opposite.  Dr. Chopra states that when one is in compliance with these spiritual laws of creation then success manifests effortlessly.<br /><br />My absolute favorite part of this book, and it hard to choose because I have several favorite parts, is when he is discussing dharma.  He defines dharma as one's life purpose.  I think it is in the last chapter.  While discussing dharma or purpose, he says that he taught his children at a very young age not to worry about getting a job, and not to worry about getting good grades in school.  He instructed his children to spend their time figuring out what their purpose was.  They were to figure out what gifts they possessed and how they were to serve humanity.  He promised them if they did this and could not find work to support themselves that he would take care of them.  I have 2 small children and I am going to do exactly the same thing.<br /><br />Excellent book and I recommend to anyone who is seeking answers to the success question.<br /><br />Warmest Regards,<br />Kai Ajala Dup&eacute;
B001TODCII|4.0|A co-worker suggested this movie saying it was better than most were giving it credit for and I was hesitant to take his word on it, as this co-worker has suggested other movies to my hubby and me that I ended up really disliking (My Super Ex-Girlfriend for example).  But I gave in and gave it a try as I do like Liam Neeson, but I wasn't expecting much in the end.<br /><br />The plot was a little weak and the movie overall was a bit formulaic.  I didn't care for Maggie Grace as the daughter, and felt her acting was a bit lame in this movie.  And I definitely wasn't expecting Liam Neeson to be so kick-butt in this movie and I was surprised at how much I really liked this film by the end!  It's a good guy takes revenge on the bad guy flick and Liam excelled at it in this movie.  And that is really why this movie is so good.  Much, much better than I thought it would be and I am glad that I took the chance and saw it.  You should too!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I confess to enjoying this film thoroughly, even though the plot has holes big enough to drive a starship through. I rebelled initially when Romulans appeared. Romulans? Who fought a war with the Federation and who were never even seen until Original Series episode \\"Balance of Terror\\"? However, the plot manages to sort this out.<br /><br />The \\"Enterprise\\" crew look reasonably like (and act reasonably like) younger versions of the beloved original series characters, and there are lots of affectionate nods towards the old series, including McCoy's famous \\"Dammit, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a ...\\". Zachary Quinto is especially effective as Spock. However, I am disappointed that there was only a slight element of the classic Spock-McCoy contretemps, and, in spite of numerous fights, Kirk failed to tear his shirt even once... Perhaps in the next film, to which I eagerly look forward.
B001N26GFM|5.0|What to say about this film?  It was engaging.  It was moving.  It was powerfully emotional.  Jack Scanlan as Schmuel was an excellent choice for the 'boy in the striped pajamas' and I had read somewhere that that young boy was able to pull at your emotions with just his facial expressions and he pulls even stronger when he does speak.  Whoever wrote that was completely right.  As does the innocence of the friendship that builds between the son of a German Nazi Commander, and a boy that lives in 'the farm' on the other side of an electrified barbed wire fence.  I found myself rooting for their friendship, even though I knew that it would be short lived.  I expected it to end when Bruno betrays his friendship to Schmuel when he lies about Schmuel taking food.  But it didn't.  The boys continue their friendship through the fence and in an attempt to apologize to Schmuel for lying, Bruno sneeks across (or under) the fence to help Schmuel find his father who has gone missing within 'the farm'.  The Nazi Commander and his wife discover their son is missing and start a frantic search to find their son.  The movie then takes an unexpected turn (although, somewhat expected if you know any history about concentration camps) and it's at that moment when your emotions are truly put to the test.  For me, I had my emotions in check up until the two boys meet and from that point on, there was no holding them back.  The tears flowed to the very end.<br />It's a powerful movie and I highly recommend it!

0385504225|2.0|As a rule, I usually do not read novels but considering the hype and the subject matter of Mr. Brown's latest novel, I forced myself to read it.  If you've seen the movies or read the books \\"Angels and Demons\\" or \\"The DaVinci Code\\", simply take all the pseudo-history and junk science and transport it to Washington D.C. instead of Rome or Paris, and you get this book.  Like Mr. Brown's previous works, this novel strains the readers' credulity until you're halfway through the book and at the point you might as well finish it.  On the other hand, if not for Mr. Brown's work this decade, the publishing business might not be where it is right now, so for that, the author deserves respect for resurrecting a moribund industry.  Overall, if you like Dan Brown, you are going to like this book.  Serious readers, stay away and you will be much better for it.
B002JOUNDY|4.0|Kenneth Branagh directs this amazing telling of Mary Shelly's original book.  The visuals are amazing, De Niro plays the monster to Oscar calibur quality, and Branagh directs himself as Victor Frankenstein.  Helena Bonham Carter does a great job as his love interest.  The best part of this movie is the fact that it doesn't shy away from the subject matter.  It takes a head on approach, showing in gruesome detail what happens when man decides to play God.  This is one that should be in your collection!

B002BFBAWO|4.0|Give props to writer-director Greg Mottola for not repeating himself.  The temptation must have been great to copy \\"Superbad\\" but \\"Adventureland\\" is a completely different animal.  Both are coming-of-age flicks but the tone here is bittersweet.  \\"Adventureland\\" is funny in part but it's mostly poignant.  I like this film alot but it didn't resonate in my subconscious like \\"Superbad\\".  This is not to slight the film but only fair warning to anybody expecting something else.
B00005JGAF|5.0|Easily one of the top ten rock records ever.  Wore out my vinyl in  six months, back in the day.  A few throw-away tunes I suppose, but there are monster classics here: Teenage Lobotomy, Do You Wanna Dance,  Rockaway Beach, Sheena, Surfin Bird,   and \\"I don't Care\\" which had what sounds like an unusual chord change, for them. Of course, they were branching ou. Within a year or two the sound was.. maturing.       The bonus tracks here fill in the story nicely.
B00004RF83|5.0|From John Frankenheimer and Rod Serling comes an edge of your seat political thriller from the height of the Cold War.

Douglas find his Col. Casey in the middle.  No special features, ws, b&w.
0385504225|3.0|Let me preface this by stating I don't read a lot of books.  My main source of reading comes from magazines in the bathroom, calorie labels and street signs.  However, I was sucked into the Da Vinci Code hype and have read all of Dan Brown's books, enjoying each one.    So, when I heard that he had another novel out, I had to jump on it (or make that \\"Sit on it\\" because when you're 5-foot-6, you need something to help you see over the steering wheel).    The Lost Symbol is typical Dan Brown, a mystery that leads Bobby Langdon (I get to call him Bobby because we're close) into Washington, D.C.  When I'm reading about all the secrets of the Nation's Capital it's very eye-opening and I was thinking to myself that Brown is making this stuff up.  He's a terrific writer and you won't be disappointed but after the climax the book just goes on and on.  Trim the final 50 pages or so of this book and it would be a 4-5 star book.  Not the best I have ever read but still a solid effort by the man who loves turtlenecks.
0765350386|4.0|The Final Empire is the first volume of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy.     The land has been controlled by the sinister Ruler for a thousand years. And for a thousand years, it has suffered. A cruel noble class enslaves and tortures the broader population. An evil church oppresses the hearts and souls of the people. The landscape itself suffers - ash raining from the sky all day and eerie mists filling the streets at night.    However, this charming realm is not without champions. A handful of Skaa (essentially the common folk) have access to Allomancy, the metal-based magic that is generally the plaything of the upper classes. Lead by Kelsier, a talented Mistborn (that is, one that can use all sorts of types of Allomancy), a crew of thieves and rebels plot the overthrow of the Final Empire.    The majority of the story is told from the perspective of Vin, a sixteen year old girl and another Skaa Mistborn. She's 'discovered' by Kelsier and brought into the plot, wherein she soon plays a critical role.     The premise of the book is, if not unique, still sadly quite rare. Whereas most high fantasy follows a 'good land, bad threat, good prevails' structure, the idea of starting in a world where the bad guys already won is too rarely explored. And Sanderson spends a lot of time in the exploration. Kelsier's crew of rebels infiltrate every aspect of society - from the military to the mines, from the church to the nobility. They discover undeniable corruption and faint glimmers of hope, and, in a credit to the author, the characters spend their time articulately debating everything. The revolution against the Ruler is a meticulously-plotted scheme, and we're let into every detail.    If the scheming is the real protagonist of the book, Allomancy takes a close second. Sanderson has invented a unique system of magic based on the consumption and 'burning' of metals. Pewter gives strength, while Brass allows emotional 'soothing', etc. It is an elaborate and intricatesystem that the author takes no small pride in explaining.    However, underneath the complex plotting and the magical world-building, there's not a lot of character development. When push comes to shove, Vin is the same magical stableboy that we see in every high fantasy novel. She's found on the streets, parentage unknown, heir to an unprecedented magical power, etc. etc. She's more likable than most, but, when everything else is stripped away, her plot arc is pedestrian and clear (down to the predictable romantic interest). This is, needless to say, a disappointment.    The Final Empire has an elaborate premise, an intriguing plot and meticulous world-building. But without strong character development, it comes dangerously close to being just another high fantasy, if better written than most. Sanderson has come up with new ways to dot the i's and cross the t's - but is still ultimately writing the same sentence.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|One-time self-proclaimed \\"Next President of the United States\\" portrays himself as a scientific expert by spewing statements like, \\"We all know...\\", \\"All scientists agree that...\\", \\"It is obvious that...\\", and \\"No one can argue that we are doing this to ourselves...\\". He falls short of claiming to have invented Global Warming in his spare time at Harvard, but other than that, there is no solid science, no scientific rebuttal, and an over-abundance of political bravado and blustering posturing. To start a \\"documentary\\" with a statement like, \\"We are killing ourselves...\\", is not only ludicrous, but silly. This statement, however, does set the scientific tone for the next hour and 45 minutes; there is no science here. Every statement he utters is either wild speculation or a simple repeat of the popular beliefs the media has shoved down the masses throats.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|\\"This Is It\\" might be a perfect elegy, capable of quitting us of our longings after the dead, now happily sent along the way to a better existence.  Compiled of footage shot during the rehearsals leading up to Michael Jackson's planned comeback tour, this cinematic event is remarkable for its mundanity, slack composition, and candid view of a personage rarely - perhaps never - viewed with such mortal limitation.  Never have his moves snapped less, his voice been feebler, never the Neverland of fame more pitiable.  Run out and go see it right now.<br /><br />Simone de Beauvoir said, \\"One is not born a genius, one becomes a genius\\", and here is firm confirmation of this truth, the implication of which is that genius is not essential but ephemeral, a coat which we wear.  MJ has many coats, but all of them are glam and unreal - he has no need for hours in wardrobe, because superstar garments are his street clothes.  When his dancers sweat down to their skivvies, Michael keeps cool in a brilliant silver, custom-made, double-breasted, over-sized sports jacket.  When his band shows up looking like its laundry day, for MJ it might as well be opening day.<br /><br />You'd think that we jaded Americans would have developed a prudent resistance to unthinking hero-worship, but alas.  Michael could not shed his living-godliness if he decreed it so, a Midas-like fate thrust upon him even as he half-asses one dance sequence after another.  Do not expect to see a single moonwalk in \\"This Is It\\", the King of Pop is weary and conserves himself to much applaud.  As in all good cults, a glimmering embodiment is ritually upheld: Michael's vague, inarticulate band direction is greeted as masterly and perfectionist, the opening sequence is unified by teary fawning from dancers the world over, and the creative \\"partnership\\" of Kenny Ortega is dominated by obsequent deference.<br /><br />\\"This Is It\\" will save you from such fanaticism, and thus I highly recommend this movie.  It is the longsought cure for Thriller fever.  I guarantee that half way through this two-hour home movie, you will look deep inside yourself and know that Michael is truly gone.  This is because under no condition save remembrance of the deceased do we readily submit to such unpolished, rambling banality.  Go ahead, treat yourself to some good old-fashioned catharsis.  Idols are meant to be deposed, Michael would have wanted it this way.

Much to my surprise it held my interest the entire length of the film.  It was warm and occasionally humorous.  All in all a very well done classic.

B002S0OBFK|4.0|A well-written review of any film should never label its subject \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\".  Rather, it should give you an idea of whether or not you can expect to enjoy it, based on your own preferences and expectations.  Paranormal Activity is a particularly controversial film when it comes to the potency of its terror.  Most reviews either complain, with great disdain, \\"I hated it - it wasn't scary at all\\" or exclaim in total satisfaction, \\"It scared the pants off me - I loved it\\".  There seems to be little in-between.<br /><br />I saw the film today, having read enough reviews to know pretty much what to expect.  But before I reveal my own reaction to Paranormal Activity, I would like to offer a few ideas that those who know little about this film may find helpful.<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock, the celebrated director who was known as \\"The Master of Suspense\\" held many interesting theories about what frightens an audience.  Hitchcock believed that, when properly stimulated, the viewer's imagination was far more powerful - and far scarier - than many direct images that may or may not frighten the average viewer.  Directly depicting a ghost, a monster or a demon for example, even with today's special effects, may scare many viewers, but that will depend solely on the quality of the effects.  And even if well done, many viewers may find the images unconvincing or downright laughable, for they may have other ideas about what a ghost, monster or demon should look like.<br /><br />However, if the filmmaker merely implies that a supernatural event is taking place, and sets up the situation with enough skill, the viewer's imagination can take over and sometimes yield a far more frightening experience than any vivid imagery ever will.  After all, people go to horror films to be frightened, and what could be more frightening than unseen terrors from one's own imagination?  By setting the mood with dark rooms, low lighting, eerie shadows and other effects that many people will associate with their greatest fears, an innocent image of two people peacefully sleeping, unaware of what may be going on about them or to them, can become very frightening indeed, even if few special effects are used.  This is especially true if the moviegoer has developed enough empathy with the characters to place themselves in the same situation.<br /><br />Many modern horror films rely on blood, gore and violence, with horrible creatures conjured up by special effects and vivid scenes involving battles with ugly demons or manic killers in order to provide thrills.  That can be a lot of fun, and certainly very scary.  But it can also be argued that, as CGI effects advance and become more vivid and frighteningly realistic, many viewers become inured to violence, blood and \\"creatures\\" while depending less and less on their own imagination, and in the process, they will sometimes forgo a far scarier experience.  I know that no special effect ever came close to my own nightmares, because my nightmares are stirred by the things I fear most, and not the things that I've been conditioned to find scary.  In short, no amount of vivid terrors can match the human imagination, provided that the imagination is properly stimulated.<br /><br />Well, this is the basic idea behind Paranormal Activity.  Largely on a shoestring budget, the writers/director/actors of Paranormal Activity have managed to create an old-fashioned thriller that relies almost exclusively on the viewer's imagination.  Those who like their \\"scary movies\\" full of CGI, monsters, blood and violence are warned; you will probably be extremely disappointed.  But if you have enough respect for your own imagination, and can allow yourself to be frightened not by what you see, but what you think is there, you just may find Paranormal Activity to be every bit as frightening and well done as many people say it is.<br /><br />By the way, I saw it with a friend.  He did not find it frightening at all.  On the other hand, I definitely expect to have trouble sleeping tonight.  Whether or not you will agree may depend on how effective your own imagination can be.<br /><br />Recommended.night.

0143105426|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years.<br /><br />And Jane Austen's grand opus is still beloved for a good reason. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night -- and the best part of it is the interplay between the two strong-willed main characters, whose initial dislike of one another blossoms into love once they learn how to overcome his pride and her prejudice.<br /><br />The Bennett family is in an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane -- since their estate is entailed and there is no Mr. Bennett Jr., a good marriage is considered essential for at least one of the girls. But her forthright, independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy. Lizzie believes Wickham's account -- and she's in for a shock when Darcy unexpectedly proposes, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives, and what Wickham did to offend Darcy.<br /><br />And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton. The family is plunged into disgrace, which also wrecks any chances of a halfway decent marriage for the other daughters. The only one who can set things right is Darcy, who will do whatever he must to make amends to Lizzie -- and unwittingly establish himself as the man she loves as well...<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances, visits and drawing room banter between Lizzie and virtually everyone else, and interwoven with some rather opinions from Jane Austen about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />The only real problem: Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time, and the narrative is kept distant from the characters. So, not for casual readers.<br /><br />But despite that formality, Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote some unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter between Lizzie and Darcy (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start (a major-league snub at a dance). Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, including the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love. An absolute must-read.ongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />Despite its mildly stuffy style, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B002MW50KO|5.0|Having been a huge Dylan fan many moons ago, I couldn't resist checking out the Amazon music sampler on his just released Christmas album \\"Christmas in the Heart\\". My first reaction was........OMG! Bob, what were you thinking? However, after giving it several go rounds, it occurred to me that it will probably end up a Holiday classic. The 40's and 50's sound is very nostalgic. The back-up vocals, fantastic. My favorites: \\"The Christmas Blues\\" and \\"Must Be Santa\\" which can be described as a \\"Swisskapolka\\" meets the seven dwarfs. Love it. Ordered it. Thanks Bob. Enough said.
0671042858|3.0|I was actually listening to the audiobook, read by Anne Heche (who added a lot to the story with her narration, I think).<br /><br />While listening to the book, I had thought the girl was a bit older than her 9 years, as Stephen King writes the protagonist as a mature individual. [She doesn't necessarily 'act' her age until the end when she is so desparate to get home].<br /><br />'Tom Gordon' refers to the baseball player she of whom she is a fan; who shows up as a 'spirit' to motivate her to keep on going. [The protagonist ran away after her brother and divorced mother were arguing while on a trip, and soon regretted her actions].<br /><br />This type of story [a child is lost, survives on his or her own while parents search] has been told before, but this story is told pretty well.
B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|A-ha has been part of collection for the past 25 years.  As such, I have a different take on this album and what has led to this musical release.  Unlike most, I felt their earlier work was fine but not outstanding.  After reforming they continued to move in a direction that \\"East of the Sun / West of the Moon\\" began.  \\"Analogue\\" was their most consistent and finest moment.   Expansive, plaintive and dour all in the same breath.  Those who hold tight to albums such as \\"Scoundrel Days\\" must understand that they were still in the process of blossoming.       We now come full circle with \\"Foot of the Mountain.\\"  Morten Harkett's voice has never been as clear and mature as on this release.  Songs such as \\"Shadowside\\" soar with strings ablaze and guitars washing over us.  One can see where Keane has found inspiration.  This album seems to meld earlier synth influences with their more current guitar flourishes creating a nice mix of old and new.  \\"What There Is\\" uses a gentle electro-inspired movement without overproduction that their early releases suffered from.  \\"The Bandstand\\" would fit nicely alongside current purveyors of Nordic and electro flavored pop such as Annie, HK119, Dragonette or Empire of the Sun.  \\"Riding the Crest\\" has synth pads channeling Gary Numan in their usage.  Most songs soar and that is not something one can say with recent A-ha releases.    While the album is not without some slower moments I digress to let you decide what merits each song impacts you.    I strongly recommend it especially in light of their breakup after their final farewell tour.    Happy listening!!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The first ten minutes of this movie alone made this the best Star Trek movie to date. Why is that... It's been said from the beginning of production that this movie had to be for everyone, not just Star Trek fans, and that's what it did. My wife, who had no interest whatsoever, is now a fan. She has now gone back and watched everything I have that's Star Trek. This movie didn't just reinvigorate a falling franchise, it sparked what could be the largest popularity this franchise has ever had.     To the so-called purists who have done nothing but rip this movie, well, just stick to your old TV series and movies and the rest of us will move forward, including what we already have, and we'll continue to enjoy new Trek for years to come.
B00005JM02|3.0|Finding Nemo: 6 out of 10: As a kid's movie Finding Nemo is great. If somehow your munchkins don't already own a copy, have the toys or God forbid seen the ice show (there is something about fish on ice that's a bit creepy. Funny but creepy.) Feel free to buy a copy. You'll get your moneys worth, as the little animatrons will undoubtedly view it endlessly.    But as an adult with no little minds of my own to feed the movie left me wanting. For one thing I've seen it before... about a hundred times before. Parent loses kid, kid loses dog, dog loses family, family loses toy, and so forth. Then the endless journey filled with danger, setbacks and endless comic relief characters begins. Finding Nemo, at least narratively, doesn't bring anything new to the party.    The fact that Pixar themselves are guilty of using this exact same plot in all their movies doesn't help matters. (Pixar's next feature The Incredibles would actually break this trend somewhat and is the most adult friendly toon of theirs to date) The simple fact is after being spoiled by Shrek (or even Ice Age) I like my kid films to be more accommodating to adults.    Not that some things don't work very well indeed (Bruce the 12 step shark and the \\"mine, mine, mine,\\" seagulls are particularly effective). It's just that the whole film had a cloying sentimentality I usually associate with NBC Olympic coverage or a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie about a Depression Christmas.    That said kids will love it. The animation is spectacular. And as these things go it certainly is very well done. Just not my cup of tea I guess. I prefer my fish with a little more bite and lemon and butter.
B002BSHWUU|3.0|Hi. I just got my stereo box yesterday.    Am I the only one who finds them extremely bright and compressed? They do sound better than previous CDs, but upper mids/treble - hot, hot, hot! And everything is pushed up to the near 0 db level! I never liked any of the previously released Beatles on CD, with following exceptions (some of these I have, and some only borrowed):     1) original Japanese version of \\"Abbey Road\\" (worth about $100 used, and now I can see why)  2) 80's Japanese \\"Let it Be\\"  3) import \\"Yellow Submarine\\" (blue cover with additional tracks and no orchestral maneuvers)  4) \\"Let it Be\\" naked    Everything else sounded unbearably bright to me, with the xception of \\"Abbey Road\\", which was just muddy. So I thought this time they would do a nice analog-like remastering job. And new version definitely has more detail and overall is not as congested as the ones before. But it seems that most people involved in the project have a severe high frequency hearing loss, either due to age, or desire to push the sound thru those car stereos and all the traffic noise. This reminds me of the 60's and 70's theory, that sound should be mixed in such a way, that it sounds great through AM radio. I have a similar sounding \\"enhanced\\" Japanese mini LP edition of Bill Evans' \\"Walts for Debby\\" - also much brighter and compressed than the original. My system was never known to be bright, so I'm pretty sure I'm hearing what I'm hearing. And I hear a lot of talk that original Beatles tapes were recorded bright. I don't know - I don't remember any of the original Parlophone LPs to sound this bright, and I've had a bunch of them in the early 70's.    As of today, I still prefer my Japanese vinyl Beatles (never was impressed with MOFI version, for the similar brightness issue and strange EQ). I hear that mono version is not as bright, so I might try that, since they are available again.
B002MW50KO|1.0|It pains me to see so many 1 star reviews coming from Dylan's own fan base.  I have been a fan for over 40 years, and I cannot disagree with the negative opinions rendered.  Bob Dylan's voice has been shot for quite a few years now, but that hasn't stopped him from making critically acclaimed albums like \\"Modern Times\\".  This holiday outing is not laughable as some have stated, but it is an embarrassment that Columbia records released it in the first place, and in the process exposed Dylan's now vulnerable voice that sounds painfully inadequate.  The only song on this entire cd that works is \\"Must Be Santa\\", Which should have been released as a limited edition X-Mas single for this charitable cause.  His live shows have become incoherent because of his smoke torn voice.  He changes all the arrangements of his songs during live shows, because he can no longer sing those notes as they were recorded.  There comes a time in everyones life, when it is time to get off the stage, whether you are a doctor, heavy equipment operator, or in this case an musician.  I believe that the time has come for Bob Dylan to do exactly that, and get off the stage and reflect on his iconic career, without having to be laughed at any longer because he hung on too long like a washed up prize fighter.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|This album kills me,and is not for virgin ears. Do not take what your hearing seriously. It is a comedy album and meant to be. That being said it is a scream with such songs as \\"Asian Hooker\\",\\"Girl From Oklahoma\\" and \\"Community Property\\" being the three funniest on the album. They stole every sound that was popular in the Eighties. Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Whitesnake you can hear in the songs. They take Sleaze Rock to a whole new level of debauchery. No one under eighteen should own this album, though you have heard worse language from your parents. For some good unclean fun this is the one for you.

B000ELJBAK|5.0|David Gilmour's first solo album was released in May 1978 squeezed in between Pink Floyd's Animals and The Wall. Needless to say, this is not to be compared to the scope of those monumental achievements. Pink Floyd was on a definite high at that point.    Truth is David's own lyrics are distinctively different from the ingenious heavy gloom of Roger Waters', something which allows the songs to carry a much lighter feel. Musically though, one can hear similarities throughout the album with that trademark guitar sounding as great as always. What we also get here is mostly the rawer vibe of guitar, bass and drums. David's beautifully inventive melodies are given even more room and jewel the songs!     Out of the nine tracks, seven were solely composed by Gilmour - three of them being amazing instrumentals. There's No Way Out Of Here was written by the members of Unicorn, a band David did some production work with, and Short And Sweet is a collaboration with the great Roy Harper. Worthy checking out is Roy's Universal Soldier album which came out two years after for a great version of Short And Sweet with Gilmour on guitar!    This remastered reissue is also worth getting for it does improve it sonically, brings a nicer booklet and offers longer codas which - even not being that revealing - are more than welcome.     To finish it off I would like to point out that while On An Island might be a more complete, better produced and an equally inspired album, when push comes to shove this is still my favourite - one I keep revisiting on a regular basis for sheer pleasure.

1401923119|5.0|[[ASIN:1401923119 The Biology of Belief: Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter, & Miracles]]    In Biology of Belief, Dr. Bruce Lipton shares his personal conclusion on conventional science and the systematic impact science has on human potential through belief.     Genetics, as a body of knowledge, serves as good example, and it stands to reason, that modern genetics is dogma, when taken strictly as matter of fact.     Through his book, Biology of Belief, Bruce chronicles breakthrough moments in science, including the cultural transformation that followed, which in some instances prevailed in spite of fundamental religious belief - a true force to reckon with.    Bruce strategically turns the tables on science by applying subjective humanistic scrutiny as the new control or protocol, while reassessing and challenging the validity of any scientific principle imposing limits on human potential.     Herein lies the benefit. When science aligns with universal truth, research becomes a facilitator for profound discovery in step with who we are as co-creators.
B002HFP0QU|3.0|You can always tell when the Holidays are approaching. Yes, kiddies 'tis the season for compilations by acts that haven't seen the charts in decades. I guess they couldn't piece Mythology together in time for Christmas so this bunch of retread material will have to suffice for now. The sound quality is excellent but does not equal the work done on the 6 disc Studio Album set from a couple of years back. The price is right, too. How generous, since 10% of us are unemployed and all of us will soon be forced to carry health insurance that we either can't afford or don't want.<br /><br />Good News!

Lotsa luck, guys! You'll need it.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|first thing first this is another sad attempt at milking the hits.  and bringing out a tired song with Paul Anka didn't move me either. Anka ain't made a song that has counted to me since \\"Silver Spoons\\" was on tv. but anyway thanks to the vocal genius of Michael Jackson he  can take the most corn syrup cut cut and make it sound rich. anybody else singing \\"this is It\\" and I wouldn't pay it much mind and I can see why MJ kept it in the vault collecting dust.  the rest of the disc has all of the usual greatest hits compilation jams which are timeless but have been sold over and over and over again. disc two though is the jewel because the demos are on point on the show Nuff.<br /><br />MJ vocally shows why there ain't nothing out here now touching him when he wants to bring it.  his versatility and range speak for itself.<br /><br />musically the brother did it all. he was truly one of a kind and so many acts owe there careers to him. the music here and the film say one thing to the acts already established and the newbies on the way:Step your game up.<br /><br />this Brother was a Musical Genius and He paved the way for so many.

B001W63DX2|5.0|Iron Maiden's most ambitious tour yet. With Bruce Dickinson piloting a custom jumbo jet carrying the entire crew, all the equipment and the band they are able to jump from continent to continent  in hours playing a concert basically every other day in a new city. The documentary is especially interesting and fun. Very impressive feat they pulled off and the concert is of course vintage Maiden. I highly recommend this for any Maiden fan.
B00168HARG|5.0|As this series neared its premier, I was absolutely positively certain that the show would be unspeakably bad.  And perhaps this is why it was canceled after its second season.  I feel that so many people (especially Terminator fans) had already made up their mind before hand and never really gave the show a chance.  I gave it a chance and watched the premier; then promptly abandoned the entire show.  As it turns out, the premier episode was the weakest of the season.  In fact, at episode three, the show suddenly goes from just 'decent' to 'awesome'.  And it was these stories about how the plot develops that I was constantly hearing from those that stuck with the show that convinced me that I needed to give it a second chance; and I'm so glad I did.    First of all, this isn't entirely a reboot.  It follows the continuity of the first two movies quite nicely, but exists outside the story line developed by T3 and Terminator Salvation.  It's an 'alternate version of events', so to speak.    {John Conner}  The character was done perfectly.  Gone is the 'most annoying kid in the world' attitude.  Here it's obvious that he's grown up watching his back at every turn.  He's sick of running; and with the arrival of a Terminator protector, he feels it's time to start fighting back.  His technical skills are also more impressive and a little more believable than previous interpretations.    {Sarah Conner}  She is, after all, the star of the show and often narrates each episode.  She's motherly but never forgets her mission to protect her son and stop Skynet before it's built.  Her days of paranoia and erratic behavior are over.  What's great about her portrayal here is she rarely ever seems to be afraid.  She's calm, cool, collected, and just plain awesome.    {Cameron}  John's Terminator protector and was initially the hardest part of the show for me to like.  I groaned during her scenes in the premier.  However, as the show developed, her character quickly grew on me.  Herscene as she looks on in fascination at the robot at the chess tournament, in particular, was remarkably directed.    {Terminators}  The rest of them are also well done.  We really get the feeling that just one of these guys is nearly unstoppable.  The initial Terminator from the pilot, Cromartie, appears to have been 'terminated' at the end of the premier.  However, the majority of this season he is seen as constantly rebuilding himself in order to complete his mission, suggesting that no matter what kind of damage a Terminator sustains, it will...never...stop.  Another example of this is when John attempts to hack an extracted Terminator CPU in which John see glimpses of the world through it's visual memory bank giving a fascinating yet disturbing look into their behavior.  At one point the CPU comes back online attempts to complete his mission despite not having a body.    Trust me, I was one of the hardest people to convince that this would ever be good.  But it is.  It's incredible.  Give it a chance to develop and grow on you and there's a good chance you'll gain as much appreciation for it as I have.    ~nico~
B00005ASHM|5.0|As a record collector,somehow I'd previously overlooked this all-important \\"Concept\\" album,until recently acquiring a version of \\"love is here\\" in association with a project I'd been working on.The Wilson influence was immediately apparent and so a copy of \\"Pet Sounds\\" I had to have!  Oddly,it wasn't until getting  to the stereo versions of the songs that the true brilliance came out,and so by track 24,my justification for buying this album was justified.  Fantastic!
B00005U122|3.0|As good as the musicians in this band are, it's much like watching a Pink Floyd tribute band. They can play all the right notes, but they will never sound like Pink Floyd.      The truth remains that the contribution Waters made to pink floyd was with lyrics, not sound. With the exception of Final Cut, it is Gilmours vocals that remain the signature sound of Floyd, and it was Gilmour and Wrights musicianship that defined Floyd.    This was a great concert, despite Waters looking disinterested at times, but no matter how talented the musicians here are, the Pink Floyd sound I grew to love is simply lacking.    If you want to hear a good cover band play Pink Floyd songs, get this DVD. The sound quality is great.      If you want to hear Pink Floyd play Pink Floyd songs post-1985, buy the Pulse DVD. (Or better yet, get the laserdisc version if you have the player and can find it!)

Cameron Diaz, in her first film, is a visual treat and perfect as Tina, the woman who may not be what she initially seems to be. Amy Yasbeck, an over-the-top Marian in the Robin Hood parody \\"Robin Hood: Men In Tights,\\" is mysterious and also may not seem to be who she initially appears to be. Peter Riegert, a nut case in \\"National Lampoon's Animal House,\\" is devious as the nasty Dorian. One of my favourite moments is-SPOILER-when The Mask is dancing at the \\"Coco Bongo.\\" I especially loved Lt. Kallaway and Doyle, specifically during the park scene and the swingin' aftermath. Hilarious, and semi-serious, from start to finish. The special features are somewhat disappointing, as there's no director commentary for the deleted scenes, which I think should have been kept in the movie. Also, the picture quality of the deleted scenes wasn't very good. I highly recommend the movie. If you like Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz, you'll LLLLOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVEEEEEEEEE<br />THIS MOVIE. Grooovvvvvvvvvy, baby. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.
B00005JXY3|5.0|The Karate Kid Part II continues the story of Daniel(Ralph Macchio) and Miyagi(the late Pat Morita) as they travel to Japan to help out Miyagi's old girlfriend and her niece(Tamlyn Tomita from The Joy Luck Club), however, they are confronted by Miyagi's old foe Sato and his nephew and Daniel's new enemy, Chozen. The martial arts sequences were great to watch as well as the romance scene with Daniel and Tomita's character. The theme song of the film \\"For The Glory Of Love\\" became a big hit in 1987 and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Music Score. This is the best of all the Karate Kid series.
B0027REDK2|4.0|I was looking forward to this reissue for quite a while, as it has both the original UK LP and the remixed versions of songs that appeared on the US LP.<br /><br />It appears, though, that I must be the only person in the US who prefers the original UK version. I did have a copy of the US LP, and then the Carnival mini-LP (as these 12\\" EPs were called at the time), but I got my CD copy almost as soon as it became available, and that is the version I have lived with since.<br /><br />Though I can appreciate them as remixes (and I have always preferred the night version of \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" to the album version), in the context of the original UK album, the remixed songs that appeared on the US pressings sound too bright and sterile.<br /><br />In terms of sound quality, this reissue is the rare instance of a remaster done up right. Dynamic range appears to be mostly left intact rather than squashed for the sake of loudness, and the overall sound is a bit fuller than the orignal CD, which sounds slightly anemic in comparsion. (EMI is excelling at this as of late, as anyone who has heard the Thomas Dolby or Beatles remasters can atttest.)<br /><br />The packaging is fantastic (though I agree with the reviewer who complained about the typeface used for the liner notes), and I particularly appreciate the attention to detail in the track listings, especially the inclusion of catalog numbers for the original releases.<br /><br />In any event, this reissue should satisfy anyone who originally bought the album way back when, regardless of which version you prefer. Recommended.

There are a couple of inconsistencies, but even so, I really liked this movie. I think it was very well done, and probably the best movie I've seen all year.     I'm not sure that all the hard core fans will like it, as it is a re-working of the \\"Star Trek Universe\\", and as THEY all know, YOU SHOULDN'T MESS WITH IT!    Seriously though, It sets up the \\"Star Trek Universe\\" for sequels, which I am looking forward to.

B001993Y2C|2.0|This set contains all the seasons of BSG and including the movie Razor, but not Caprica or The Plan. I thought that the inclusion of Razor was a nice bonus, since I only thought the regular episodes were included.  The box is quite large and overly done.  The top of the box lifts up exposing the central core of character photos, kinda like your opening a futuristic computer core. There is the plastic Centurion action figure on top, it's average quality and can barely stand up on its own. The bottom part of the box is quite drab as the colorful cardstock piece falls off once the plastic wrap is removed.  The blue blu-ray band and red dress of Caprica actually gives a nice contrast. The episodes are contained in four containers one on each side of the box's perimeter.<br /><br />My main problem was with the containers for the episodes.  The blu-ray discs are are staggered in a flip top like holder.  I could barely get them out, at first I thought that the packaging was damaged as the cheap cardstock that holds them in place seemed smashed, but realized that they were all that way.  The flip top lid is also held in place by an odd \\"rubber velcro\\" with is hard to secure in place.  It all felt very cheap and unfortunately I didn't feel that I could store them safely on a shelf without the elaborate box.  I ended up returning it for the reason of being unable to easily access the discs and the fear of scratching them since you almost need some needle nose pliers to remove them. I plan to either buy the european region free tin or await another and hopefully cheaper box set.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|I have been listening to this album on a typical Sunday morning. What a piece of work. Listening to all the instruments makes you think that there are still excellent musicians around. Portnoy delivers!!! His drumming skills are incredible. Less we forget the remaining members. Trewawas' bass line provides the groundwork for the remaining instruments.  Go and buy this masterpiece. You will play it constantly!!!!
B000069AUI|4.0|A Rush of Blood to the Head being Coldplay's 2nd studio album and their 2002 release is an alternative rock release with a sound that to my ears sound like alternative rock light. That does not mean that it is a bad album. Far from it but alernative to me should be a bit more experimental. One could also call this Brit Pop. The album spawned 4 singles. \\"In My Place\\", \\"The Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\" and \\"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\\". The album was met with positive reviews  and Allmusic, Rolling Stone and The Guardian all gave it high marks. The booklet is very sparse. It contains no lyrics but a bunch of links to political organizations important to the group. 4/5.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I'm still trying to decide on this new album but so far its just been OKAY. Nothing really stands out about it and makes me feel like listening to it over and over again. Definately NOT my favorite album. Don't get me wrong its got some nice songs to it and maybe if your a fan of Michael Buble you'd like or love this more album but not me!
B00000273M|4.0|Greatest Hits being a compilation album with the Bangles and contains such classic tracks such as \\"Manic Monday\\",\\"If she knew what she wants\\", \\"Walk Like An Egyptian\\" and \\"Eternal Flame\\". The booklet contains no lyrics but we get well written liner notes written by Mark Rowland. Allmusic and Robert Christgau gave this album high marks in their reviews and I agree. 4/5.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|A marvellous look back, a nostalgia trip, and it's everything they say it is - Kristofferson does an excellent job of narrating, the tracks chosen are very indicative of the extraordinary breadth of talented artists who appeared on the show - but the clothes and hair?  whoagh, take a look at Loretta Lynne and Marty Robbins and weep!  The only incongruous performer is Joni Mitchell, who seems atrangely out of place and key.  A truly brilliant DVD and highly recommended to both all Cash fans but also to those who went through those times.
B002NOAF9W|2.0|I've loved this album since I bought it on vinyl at a used record store in 1983.  The Stones have put out a ton of live material, but I've always considered this their very best.  The heart-pounding, fists-clenched version of Midnight Rambler is probably the best live track the Rolling Stones ever produced.   Bluesy yet energetic renditions of lesser Stones classics like Live With Me and Stray Cat Blues stand out too. A couple of Chuck Berry chestnuts are lovingly rendered, retaining the original fun while adding depth and texture.  Mick's iconic banter with the audience (\\"I've just busted a button on my trousers...\\") is a lot of fun, too. I could go on, but anyone considering buying this thing already knows and loves this collection.      When I first heard about a new version, with unreleased tracks and even some video, I bought it without hesitation.  I should have hesitated.  The new edition is nothing if not well-packaged, coming in a thick box that's just a bit too tall to fit onto most CD shelves.  Inside, there's a hardcover book with lots of pictures and some bland text by the usual bunch of self-important Rolling Stone (the mag, not the band) writers and critics.  And then there are the discs.  Disc 1 is the original album, supposedly remastered, but I didn't hear a difference.  To be fair, when I ripped disc 1 into iTunes using Apple Lossless Encoding, it did register a slightly higher bitrate than the original CD, which I purchased in the late 1980s.  So...there's that.  Disc 2 has the unreleased tracks.  Oh boy!  Now we're getting somewhere.  After 40 years, some new material from that amazing performance.  So I popped it into my CD player and heard a very nice version of Prodigal Son, followed by 4 undistinguished tracks AND THAT'S IT.  Five tracks count 'em FIVE. I was pretty disappointed, but there were 2 more discs, so I soldiered on.      Disc 3 contains highlights from the other performers who played with (maybe \\"warmed up for\\" is too harsh) the Stones.  There's some ok stuff here from B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner, but both artists put out better material on their own.     disc 4 was the \\"Bonus DVD\\" with live footage from these legendary shows.  I was amped again, despite the disappointment of disc 2.  Again, I was disappointed.  Yes, there is some nice footage of Mick and Keith doing that same version of Prodigal Son, and snippets of some other stuff, and there is some nearly-wordless footage of Keith talking to Jimi Hendrix.  Then there is some pointlessly lengthy footage of Mick trying to direct the album cover photo shoot on a highway that was closed down while the Stones dithered and complained about the cold.  I think the whole DVD was about 20 minutes long.      This could have been an effective release if they had ditched the fancy package and hardcover book, added the unreleased tracks to disc one, jettisoned discs 3 and 4 altogether, and put it out as a augmented and remastered version of Get Yer Ya Yas Out.  Then again, they couldn't charge $42 for that, which is what I paid for it, let alone the $60 suggested retail price.  Hopefully, some of you will read this and avoid making the same mistake.
B000000I0I|5.0|I first heard Ommadawn when I was in college, maybe age 19.  Now, 24 years later, I still find it one of the most affecting, soulful, beautiful and inspiring pieces of music I've ever heard (especially side 1).  It's the sort of thing I used to lie in my dorm room with my girlfriend of the time and listen to with the lights out.  How to describe it: a cosmic, atavistic, almost tribal hymn; a chorus to this world and every other, a play of the gods, a dance of angels...  I could go on, and maybe I would start to sound kind of silly or corny, but it's all true.  If you want to hear music that can really affect you, this is it.  It is timeless.
B001C4CI8A|3.0|3 of 5 stars for the gritty drama movie Body of Lies. The lead role is played by Leonardo DiCaprio who does a great job playing a deep undercover CIA spy in the middle east. The plot is rather complex and I don't think I could summarize it easily. The focus is on middle east terrorism and a couple of groups making plans. The movie was expansively photographed with a rich selection of locations. Since the story jumps from country to country (Jordan, Turkey, USA, etc) they did a nice job of giving a look to each place. There are some action scenes which are good. Some brutal torture scenes and a fair amount of blood. The movie seemed long and its pace slow at times. All-in-all, I did enjoy it and do recommend it.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|It was hard to  choose but I finally opted for the mono box. I have  all the 87 cd's and it was time to listen to Revolver and Peper in mono after all that has been said about these mix.     A great box indeed ! I'm glad I have it. Peper in mono is fantastic. But the real revelation is the White album mono mix. I think it's far better. Back in the USSR, Dear Prudence are just tremendous. And even Ob La Di-Ob La Da sounds nice without the stupids hand claps of the stereo version.    But is it the ultimate box ? No. Some stereo remasters works better and for each cd it's mainly a question of taste. Mono or stereo ? Here's my choice :    PPS :  mono even if I'm not so impressed and if the remastered stereo sounds also great to my ears. Actually I love the stereo version of the Capitol Early Beatles album.  WTB : mono, but again I think the stereo Capitol Second album with the reverb is great, as is the UK remastered stereo version.  AHDN : stereo.   BFS : stereo shines.  Help : 65 stereo mix. But the capitol version is the one I love best. That's only me you know...  RS :  65 stereo mix, more airy ...   Revolver : stereo. Overall I'm a bit dissapointed with the mono mix : the trippiest songs are best heard in stereo.  Peper : mono, so smooth. Really great !  MMT : mono.  White album : mono.The real surprise for me !    KInd regards.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I just finished watching this and I can't stress enough how important and informative it is. You must watch this dvd.
B00008YLV2|5.0|This will be a gift for my 16 year old son so he hastn' received it yet.  He loves Black Hawk Down and has watched a zillion times.  I think it will be a hit.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I found this CD to be inspiring, moving and...well, amazing. It's one of Michael Buble's best. My favorite is his song, \\"Haven't Met You Yet\\". Although, the covers that he did on this album are also great. He does great renditions of \\"Always on my mind\\" and \\"At this moment\\". I'm a big Michael Buble fan and I believe that this is one of his best. Run out and pick this up!
B000NIVJGI|1.0|I have a Samsung Blu-Ray, and the BR disc of the 20th Anniversary version of Dirty Dancing. The picture quality of the movie is just awful, particularly on the indoor scenes. Faces and backgrounds were almost fuchsia, almost always. I did not adjust my TV color, since all of the \\"extras\\", including extended scenes, outtakes, and deleted scenes were perfect quality. What a pity. My first BR disc purchase and such a disappointment. The manufacturer should be ashamed.[[ASIN:B000NIVJGI Dirty Dancing (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]]
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie does not replace the other Trek shows and movies, it parallels. The original series has alternate, parallel universes; my favorite is \\"Mirror, Mirror,\\" TOS episode 33 - which has a very different Capt. Kirk; the Terran Empire it is one of the most drastic re-imaginings of ST (and we already knew by this time that Kirk has a dark side - in the first TOS first season episode \\"The Enemy Within\\").<br /><br />There are several alternate time line stories in the various Trek series - some involving time travel, and many while Roddenberry was at the helm (including the aforementioned episodes that shows a vicious Kirk) which shows that such things are not against Roddenberry's vision at all. True Star Trek fans can, and do, appreciate alternate universe stories.<br /><br />I grew up on TOS, and watched all the other Trek series with passion. I collected Star Trek novels. I wallpapered part of my bedroom with extra copies of Star Trek blueprints. I wear a VOY outfit every year for a campus lecture I give on literary influences in Star Trek. I show the STNG episode \\"The Defector\\" to my English 101 students (for their definition essay assignment). And yet, somehow, I manage to also be a fan of this film. I do not mind diversity in the Trek universe, I do not mind re-imagining (if it wasn't for alternate universes, would we have seen Uhura in that great \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" uniform? The Terran Empire was evil, but what uniforms they had!). The other series are still alive - always will be.<br /><br />If you don't like this particular series (I hope there are sequels), that's fine but do not project your dislike to all fans - we are a diverse lot (as appropriate for Roddenberry's vision). For instance, I was never a big Deep Space 9 fan although I still watched it faithfully, and it did have one of my favorite ST episodes: \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" - another re-imagining, though not as drastic as \\"Mirror, Mirror.\\" But I will not call a Deep Space 9 fan as being somehow not a true Star Trek fan or less of one. For would not such judgment prove that it was I who was actually not the true Star Trek fan?<br /><br />This movie is an alternate universe Star Trek - accept it as such and enjoy the ride, for it is a great ride. Besides the great action, there are good characterizations. Yes, Nero could have used a bit more character development, and Spock needs a bit more explaining though I get the feeling we will learn more as the series progresses; for those who feel that the characters are not fully explained or developed, if they were fully explained and developed in this movie, what is left for future movies? I like that there is some mystery that is only hinted at, and that we have to wait to find the answers to (Spocks and Uhura's relationship for one!). There are also plenty of inside jokes and nods to all previous Star Trek series (each time I see the movie I catch more). So, is this a movie for real Trek fans? Yes. Infinite Diversity from Infinite Combinations - enjoy this re-imagining, this alternate universe.n or less of one.

0061719544|5.0|This memoir is unapologetically honest and inspirational, with bits of wisdom thrown in that really make you stop and think. All of this done with both humor and extraordinary poignancy, making you laugh on one page, and cry on the next. This is definitely on my list of Must Reads. Get the hard-back to enjoy the photos and the Kindle version so you can read while traveling. Be sure to follow up with the audio-book -- read by the author -- and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Other reviewers have mentioned the political side to this book, and yes, there are a (very) few political thoughts and comments thrown in that not everyone is going to agree with. They in no way overwhelm or otherwise distract from enjoying this book. Besides, being able to have and express differing thoughts is part of the beauty of being an American, whether native born, or -- in Craig's case -- on purpose. Well done, Mr. Ferguson. Proud and pleased to have you as a citizen.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Wow... don't know why it took so long to see this newest album, but it was indeed worth the wait!  Yeah, at 21 she still has that amazingly youthful quality but this set is sooooo much more than \\"cute\\".  David Foster has crafted a sound and style that belies Renee's age and experience and, in fact, establishes a recognizable uniqueness that all singers  struggle to find. Picture a mix of Joni James and Ricky Lee Jones... now double the talent level.  Unlike many albums, this one is memorable for every track...no weak fillers here.  If you love vocal swing with ear-filling, heart-pumping big band accompaniment, then all I can say is BUY IT!!
1416594787|5.0|Dawkins is outstanding as ever in presenting mind stimulating information that really puts the world we know into perspective.
0385504225|5.0|Super read, can't put it down! Lots of historical facts, and for those familiar with Washington, DC, you'll be surprised at what you did not know about this city! Great follow-up to DaVinci Code!
B001JNNE64|5.0|Blu-ray book review:  The Film- The image quality is a little soft, but a vast improvement to the DVD version.  The sound quality is excellent.  The hd presentation of \\"Amadeus\\" is very good considering its age, and if that isn't enough to buy this DVD the wealth of supplimentals makes this a no brainer!  The disc comes in a digibook with about forty pages of production notes and cast and crew info (unfortunately the hardback cover of my copy was slightly dented in transit).  There is a digital copy compatible with Windows Media Player. I really don't see myself watching a 3 hour film on my zune, but you might. Also included is an hour long documentary on the making of the film, which is quite good.  The extras that I have enjoyed the most are the audio commentary and CD. For $13 this package is a steal!
B001PR0YDA|5.0|The story of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and its themes haven't been fresh in people's minds for well over 100 years, which is why the new film adaptation by Robert Zemeckis is so surprising. This is, from my perspective, the definitive version - a sumptuous visual feast that in no way compromises the drama, excitement, and hope of the Charles Dickens classic. Its greatest achievement is not reducing itself to the level of jolly Christmas clichés. The streets and buildings of nineteenth-century London are brightly coated with snow, yet they betray the cold reality of poverty and despair. And Ebenezer Scrooge, having been played by many, many actors over the years, finally looks like the ancient, decrepit, bitter man I always imagined him to be; his face doesn't show the slightest trace of warmth, humor, or charm.    The film's success can be attributed to Zemeckis' love affair with special effects, which in this case involves the same motion capture technology he employed in \\"The Polar Express\\" and \\"Beowulf.\\" This allows for the creation of characters caught in that delightful gray zone between real and unreal. Some are more exaggerated than others; Scrooge - a little too tall, a little too thin, a little too hunched over - is a menacing physical representation of his own anger and resentment. The Ghost of Christmas Past, an elfin wraith with a breathy voice and a head made of fire, is as slight, slender, and soft-spoken as a candle. The Ghost of Christmas Present is a loud and jovial Father Christmas figure, whose laugh is just as big as his body, perhaps bigger. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is a silent yet frightening skeletal phantom made out of shadows.    Scrooge and the Ghosts are all played by Jim Carrey, which hardly comes as a shock since he has an affinity for variety of character and over the top performances. Other actors include Gary Oldman as Bob Crachit, Tiny Tim, and Jacob Marley, whose postmortem appearance in Scrooge's bedchamber is intensely creepy, just as it should be. Robin Wright Penn plays both Scrooge's younger sister, Fen, and his neglected fiancée, Belle. Bob Hoskins plays old Fezziwig, a man so thoroughly in the Christmas spirit that he and his wife defy gravity as they dance. Colin Firth plays Scrooge's hopelessly optimistic nephew Fred, quite possibly the only person who thinks his uncle is worth addressing in a friendly manner.    As Scrooge is taken on his journey of redemption, both he and the audience are treated to fantastic aerial tours of London, with shots that swoop and soar over rooftops, through windows, and around street corners. 3-D technology, normally so unimpressive, is here perfectly utilized, allowing for one of the most immersive environments of any recent animated film. One of the most stunning sequences involves a spectral carriage chasing a shrunken Scrooge up and down dark, snowy cobblestone streets; it's not only an astounding visual achievement, it's also an exhilarating thrill ride. Harkening back to the roller coaster train sequences created for \\"The Polar Express,\\" Zemeckis proves that you should stick with what works best.    There are also some equally effective quiet moments, such as the opening shot, which pays homage to classic Disney animated films with the opening of a book. Other moments are surprisingly powerful, as when a grieving Bob Cratchit, his eyes red with tears, seems to be staring directly at Scrooge even though he can't really see him (Cratchit, in that moment, is nothing more than a vision of the future). I also appreciated the shot of doomed ghosts floating just outside Scrooge's window; some of them act humorously, banging their heads against their chain boxes, and yet we can't help but feel sorry for them.    The entire film embodies a darker, shivery tone - not to the point of becoming a computer-animated horror film, but certainly beyond the colorful whimsy of the average Christmas special. This, I believe, truly captures the tone of Dickens' original story, which doesn't spare the reader the hardships of destitution, disease, and loss. Consider Bob Cratchit's family; they do make merry of themselves on Christmas Day, but they also live a meager existence, and there's always the sense that, should nothing about their situation change, they could end up with even less.    Robert Zemeckis created a perennial holiday classic with \\"The Polar Express,\\" and I think he may have done it again with \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" Yes, we have seen this movie before, and yes, its message is far from original. But there's no denying the fact that it's sending a good message, where love, compassion, and the possibility of hope reign supreme. There's also no denying that, with visuals this striking, it practically begs to be seen, especially in 3-D. This is one of the year's best looking animated films, so richly detailed, so sharply defined, so gloriously shot. It creates a mood, effectively evoking feelings of warmth and tenderness without becoming sappy or mindlessly cheerful. That above all made seeing this film an absolutely beautiful experience, one that I recommend to everybody.
0385504225|2.0|Maybe to be begin with, I must tell you that this is not a novel but a script for a planned blockbuster. Maybe if one takes it as a script, disappointment would be lesser. After the Da Vinci Code, this is a very frustrating one for the fans like me. Some quick notes:<br />1. Character formations in the novel are extremely weak, shallow. Robert Langdon is a reactionary guy. He first reacts to whatever told him, then he is surprised and accepts. Same pattern throughout the novel.<br />2. After [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]], Mr. Brown might have decided not to touch culturally and religiously sensitive issues. This book will not bring much reaction from the Church etc.<br />3. The novel looks likes a \\"sponsored post\\" (!). As if funded by freemasonry establishment. I have no problem with freemasonry, just that the novel should have gone beyond mere propaganda.<br />4. Well, despite all, if the narrative brought about exciting revelations like it did in the previous novel, it would still be satisfactory for me. But I wasn't particularly excited with turning points in the novel...
B002C6K7NU|1.0|It really is a shame. After all that this band has been through, you want them to make a new disc of original material that is within shouting distance of any of the classic 70's discs. Unfortunately, this disc is,IMHO, the nadir of their career. The songs sound all the same, with a metal-lite generic sheen that sounds like a thousand bar bands across the USA. The lyrics sound like focus-group slogans designed to incite the beer swilling goobers at whatever state fair they're playing at to yell \\"SKIN-NERD\\" and tongue-kiss their fat girlfriends. The worst example would be the song Skynyrd Nation. And the whole \\"I want it to be the way it used to be\\" vibe is naive and lame. I can imagine everybody standing out at the T-shirt stand until they hear the opening chords of Free Bird and thus escaping the playing of any of these new songs. And Johnny V., to put it plainly, SUCKS!!! You are not Ronnie, so stop trying to be! I would rather hear a Rickey Medlocke solo disc than another one as bad as this one.....
B0002B15XI|5.0|This is the original movie that started  the MASH TV series.  Alan Alda isn't in it  nor is Roberta Swift of  many of the characters you are used to from many years of the TV series.  However Trapper John and the Painless Polock are there, who are not in the TV series.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This is a must see.  I feel many people will feel differently about there negative feelings about Michael Jackson.  Michael himself was a child and in this film you see him smile, chew gum and suck on a lollipop.  He was truly looking forward to his comeback tour but just watching what he did to prepare for this endeavor, you can tell he was truly happy.  He wanted his children to watch him as a preformer and not just \\"dad\\".  That was the whole intention for this tour.  I use to feel very negative about Michael Jackson but after seeing this film and viewing how hard he worked and how gracious he was to those who were working with him, I feel he was truly unfairly accused of the charges that were brought against him.  I still believe it was not a good choice to have young boys sleep in his bed but I truly believe he never touched any of those kids.  Rest in peace Michael.
0783225849|5.0|What is there to say, This is a fantastic classic that one must have and have watched a hundred times.  It is a great movie.  The famous shower scene is that famous, Anthony Perkins was wonderful as Norman.  I can't say enough about it.  You must have the movie in your collection.  If you don't collect movies at least watch it. It's great.
B000002O8D|4.0|This CD is pretty good.  The Lynyrd Sknyrd Band does their best to deliver the goods.  Guitarist Ed King sounds incredible and the songs featuring guests like Steve Morse and Toy Caldwell are stellar.  Freebird is truly moving with the audience singing for the late Ronnie Van Zant and Ed King does an incredible job peforming Allen's solo on it.<br /><br />However, if there is only one thing that keeps this CD from getting 5 stars is Johnny Van Zant's lack of his big brother's vocal muscle.
0307266303|5.0|As a person who aspires to be a runner, but really isn't, this book really has the potential to be life changing for me.  If you've ever been told humans aren't meant to run, or that a new, more expensive shoe will fix your injury problems, you soooooooo should read this book.  Some interesting science tucked in to the middle of a great story, very well told.  Loved the description of what he looked like when he was video taped running - laughed out loud.
1603420398|5.0|If you like the cover of this book, you will certainly like its contents!    Lovely fresh colours, and LOTS AND LOTS of beautiful shapes and patterns.     The book starts off with a short course in how to crochet, very well explained with clear photographs in close up.    Each section of the book covers one shape (e.g. circles) and for each shape she uses different combinations of four colours (three shades of green and orange for circles; purple, pink, lilac and green for hexagons, etc.). this gives the book a balanced look, you won't be overwhelmed by all the different colours, and it will also give you an idea how different motifs of the same basic shape will work in different colours (all the individual motifs are really different, she doesn't just change the colours to create a 'new' pattern!)    I really loved the lay out of the book:  There is one motif per page. Each page has a photograph, a diagram (a pattern description in symbols only), a pattern description in text only - very good, so you can switch between visual pattern and text, and they therefore complement each other nicely - and a paragraph or two against a coloured background with some handy advice.    I crocheted a lot when I was in my teens (and yes, mainly squares and circles), and then I sort of stopped and moved on to other things. Had I owned this book then, I probably never would have stopped (be warned!).    Because it is such a long time since I held a crochet hook, it takes some time for me to work out her patterns (just reading at the moment), but her instructions are very clear and she makes good use of diagrams and photographs. I am confident that I will be able to solve any crocheting problems with just this book, and I own her other book too (the crochet answer book), which I also really like very much.    Yes, of course the book would be even lovelier if it also had photographs of finished projects - as some reviewers suggest - , but with the thoroughness of this author the book would then probably be too heavy to handle. Because the possibilities are literally endless. And personally, I am very glad she chose to limit herself to describing different motifs, as I would not have wanted to miss any of them.    If you really want to find out how to combine her shapes without actually making them first, you can ofcourse use a photocpier, or buy two extra copies of the book (one for each side of the page), cut them up, fill a printing page with your chosen shapes, and start copying then.    Have fun! I certainly will...
B0028SVXR6|5.0|Make no mistake by reading other reviews of this album- NO ONE, other than Mars Volta, could have made this album.  Lay your expectations of a nostalgically repeating past of Deloused or Francis or whatever album you love coming back for another.  The Mars Volta have focused their lens on an element of their style seen in part in every other album they have made (the slow, subtle, melodic)and extended it for a full length album that in my humble opinion, stands FOR WHAT IT IS as a masterpiece.  Buy the album.  Open your mind.
B001O0TXAS|5.0|I bought this movie based on a friend's recommendation and even though I don't have little kids, I enjoyed it so much that I bought the second movie where they return to Africa.  The smattering of Life's Lessons throughout the movie only add to its appeal.

B002NUULNG|4.0|Ahh...Ghost in the Shell. The 1995 movie based on the manga that was called by some the second coming of Akira. I can't help but agree with that. So here we are almost 15 years later and we now have a sequel, a spin-off TV show, with a TV movie and it's influence is seen in movies such as \\"The Matrix.\\" Now we have GitS 2.0, which is not a sequel (though I can see why people could be misled into thinking that.) but a redone version of the first movie. The colors has been changed and some CG has been brought in to replace the old animation. Its supposed to look more like the sequel, \\"Innocence,\\" but honestly it looks weird since the original movie was made 9 years before the sequel. But I'm not going to review the movie itself, I'm just going to tell you why you should buy this on Blu-Ray.  The first thing all you purists need to know, the original Ghost in the Shell is included on the disc in HD. It doesn't look that great but it looks better than the DVD for sure. Also, the transfer is not the DVD master from the 2005 re-issue simply upconverted (contrary to popular belief), it is the Blu-ray master from Japan. They didn't really clean up the film but this is pretty much the best it's ever going to look unless Bandai, Manga or Production IG want to put up the money for a full re-master.  Which brings us into the new 2.0 version. This puppy has demo worthy video. The animation has been nicely cleaned-up, the new CG pops, and the re-mixed soundtrack (which I'll get back to in a minute) can bring the house down. This is one of the best animated Blu-rays out there, up there with \\"Cars,\\" \\"Wall-E,\\" and \\"Akira.\\" While consistency is off thanks to the new CG, new colors and old animation, but this is not the fault of the transfer.   The soundtrack for the original Japanese version has actually been thrown out the window completely. Not only are there new sound effects, but the original cast has re-recorded all their lines, with one exception: the Puppet Master. The Puppet Master was originally voiced by a man, and has now been replaced by a woman. Also the song that plays in the background during the market chase with Batou has been removed. It is such a small thing that people probably won't notice (but I brought it up for a reason).  Now, I'm going to be honest, I'm a fan of the English dub of GitS in all of its forms. When this was announced I thought for sure they would re-dub the movie with the new GitS: Stand Alone Complex cast. This is not the case. They used the original dub from 1995 for this version (So Mimi Woods is playing Motoko, not  Mary Elizabeth McGlynn from the SAC dub.) with the new sound effects thrown in. Which brings us to a inconsistency because in the 2.0 version the Puppet Master is supposed to be played a female, but instead, is still played by a man, since this is literally the same dub. This isn't the only inconsistency, the song from the marketplace is now back in the movie. There some other small gripes but only the hardcore fan would notice.  Now onto the extras. They consider the old version of the movie as a extra, and it is a pretty cool extra, having both versions in HD. Then we come into a couple of weird quirks. On the box, it says there is a commentary with the director, as well as a making of feature for 2.0. What we get is a making of feature....for the original movie and a theatrical trailer...for the original. Along with come bios and glossary. The features on the box are no where to be found, which is quite a big gaff. Maybe future re-prints will correct this but as of now, the features on the box are not there. To me, it isn't a big deal, but it kind of sucks that we don't get what the box promises.  All in all this is a must buy for every GitS fan. Not only do you get the new version of this movie, you get the original in HD. That way, you get the best of both worlds. Everyone else, give this one a rental, because this is really for the fans.  EDIT: 9/29/11 - The included original version of Ghost in the Shell is not the HD master from Japan. It is a laserdisc master, upconverted to 1080i. Also, they've fixed the back cover in later prints to have the correct features on the back. I still recommend this if you're a fan.
B0029O08WA|4.0|Some of the negative reviews made me write one myself. After reading that the music in this album is poor, not emotional, too depressive and so on, I made a conclusion that either you understand this type of music or you don't. In no universe this music is bad.<br /><br />Basically, all of the songs are indie. Therefore, it is absolutely natural that a person who all his life listened to madonna and now enjoys Miley Cyrus will not like this. The thing is that indie music is too complicated and not catchy enough to fall in love with it at the first listen. So if you've never were a fan of indie music and you've never listened to any of the artists in the album, it is unlikely you will like the \\"New Moon\\" soundtrack. However, you've always have to begin somewhere, so it might be that after a few listens, you may like this and, who knows, become an indie fan. On the other hand, if you want to understand this music, you will not achieve that, while listening to the album at the party or when busy. You have to take some time off and just listen.<br /><br />Another thing, which really annoyed me, is that people compare this to the first album. I guess that they wanted the same album with the same bands. But what's the point of releasing the same soundtrack to a different story with different emotional status? If you enjoyed the first soundtrack just because Paramore was there, I mean, they've released their new album, go and buy it. If you're looking for something particular and that artist is not on this soundtrack, how can you be disappointed, if the bands which are here already are literally great? But again - it's all about if you've experienced indie before. You will be disappointed if you want the same stuff as it was on the first soundtrack, if you want good music - here it is.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />- Meet Me On The Equinox<br />- Roslyn<br />- Done All Wrong<br />- No Sound But The Wind<br />- New Moon (The Meadow)
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I purchased this movie for my two preschool daughters.  Normally, I would not have purchased a blu-ray (extra cost) but with the discount code I only paid 12.97 including s&h.  I could not have bought a dvd for that.  My girls love the movie.

B001UW58WW|5.0|I bought this DVD just before I went to David Garrett's concert with my family in NYC where he played the songs from this DVD and many others.  David Garrett is, hands down, one of the most talented violinists in the world!  He plays classical, as well as the modern music, with such ease.  Seeing him in person, of course, is so much better than just listening to him, since you could actually see him interact with his band members (each one very, VERY, talented in their own right.)  Great listening music in the car or in the house, this DVD soothes the soul.  Highly recommend it.
0307266303|4.0|I picked up a sample of \\"Born to Run\\" on my Kindle and before I was halfway done with the sample, I went back and purchased the entire book.  I am new to running, a sport that I have always HATED with a passion.  I have always been surrounded by runners and my build did not allow for me to run for any great distance.  In the past year I discovered how wrong I was and I am slowly developing a love for running... ...and that is the common theme in all the characters in the book.         Yes, this book is about the Tarahumara, a tribe of ultra-healthy, seclusive Mexican Indians who have survived through the centuries by running.  Whether it was outrunning trouble or outrunning dinner, these people's culture surrounded itself on outperforming everything around them.  This book is also about other people outside of the Tarahumara nation who share that same love.  People who enjoy pushing their bodies to the limits, and what happens when both of these worlds get together to race.         Peppered within the story, Mr. McDougall also refers to the historical and sociological implications of running.  At times, these can be a bit distracting from the main story, but they do allow the reader to develop an appreciation (or further appreciation) for how running has shaped humanity, even when talking about cultures which have rarely intertwined.  A few times I found myself saying \\"yeah, yeah, I get it, now let's get back to the story\\", but to be fair, I always got my wish after only a couple of pages.           I highly recommend this book.  The story is well told and I found myself wanting to go out for a run after each chapter.  A few of my friends have picked it up based on my recommendation and they have all come back to thank me for it.  Today we are heading over to a book signing and I intend to thank Christopher McDougall for writing this book.  It has already inspired me to run further and more often and I am discovering the runner inside of me.
0385504225|5.0|I was wary of picking up this book. I loved the Da Vinci Code and I've found that with sequels, while entertaining, don't usually provide the \\"oomph\\" of the first book (and I say \\"first\\" loosely because I know Angels and Demons preceded Da Vinci but I had read Da Vinci first and then gone back and read Angels and Demons).    That being the case, I was pleasantly surprised when I couldn't put Lost Symbol down! To me the story had much more action, more character development, and more drama than Da Vinci. It also seemed to provide a lot more food for thought than Da Vinci Code did. I was swept up in the thrilling story line and finished the book within 2 days of picking it up!     If you haven't picked up this book yet, please do. You won't regret it! Dan Brown just gets better and better!

Did you learn something by reading above?  Or Did you get remind something by reading above?    Skill is practical only after measuring trade-off and context.

0385341008|5.0|I had forgotten that the Channel Islands were under German occupation during World War II.  This little gem of a book brings that part of history to life with such charm and tenderness that you just don't want the book to end.  The format is similar to 84 CHARING CROSS ROAD and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, but this is the best of the three books.  You feel as if you know these people and that they actually existed.  It has spurred me on to read more about the Channel Islands and their history and, if I'm lucky, I'm going to see them for myself.

B000NVL9FQ|4.0|Emerson, Lake & Palmer - Emerson, Lake & Palmer (3.77 stars)<br />Original Release: November 00, 1970<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />The Barbarian (3 stars)<br />Instruments combine to evoke the image of a heavy, plodding Barbarian moving across the landscape.  The quick work of the drums, however, evoked a sense of listening to the soundtrack of a silent film however.  The busy-ness of the instrumentation on this instrumental tends to tire the ear and detract from the passages that creatively evoke the mood that the song aims at.<br /><br />Take a Pebble (4 stars)<br />The bass and a profound piano accompany the haunting vocals in the first part of this song.  Then with a cascading rhythm layered piano takes over.  In the middle of this there is a quiet section with a thoughtful acoustic guitar playing amidst the sounds of water drops.  the lyrics are difficult to interpret but I suspect that what they are getting at is how the moments of our lives, successive moments in time, disturb, distort and destroy our memories causing them to fragment and to dissipate as the force of the latest experience propagates in our minds like a pebble thrown into a pool.  The quiet mid point of this song might represent a moment when the knower achieves a reflective clarity regarding this relentless process and finds a place of stillness within the perpetual succession of time.  Layered piano work has both a timeless cascading part and an ever changing timely part.  The end of the song concludes this pleasant and disturbing journey with further descriptive words.<br /><br />Knife Edge (4 stars)<br />The menacing lyrics walk you through a mad world with a mildly hypnotic rhythm.  The instrumental middle section expands the musical theme and moves briefly to a more ethereal passage.  Then its back to the plodding guitar-organ of the openning hard rock theme.<br /><br />the Three Fates: Clotho/Lachesis/Atropos (4 stars)<br />Big evil organ opens the song.  After a while a piano emerges.  The piano playing is strong, colorful, then quiet, gentle.  Then the piano swells with a rising passion like ocean waves.  Emersons piano work moves through many themes and takes you in many directions with skillful ease.  There are lots of interesting textures and moods painted in succession by Emerson in this instrumental.  There is a good balance of variety without becoming a tedious jam session.  The song ends in an explosion that dissipates just as the next song kicks in.<br /><br />Tank (3 stars)<br />In this instrumental the percussive melody paints the picture of some persistent machine moving over the landscape.  A drum solo appears which seemlessly fits into the feel of the song as a whole but sounds still like a drum solo.  I have a sense of a tank negotiating in its plodding yet nimble way an obstacle course of a landscape as I listen to this song.  In the last half of the song a sinister rhythm of synthesizer, drums and and bass kicks in.  Then a high-pitched harmonica synthesizer sound plays a strange blues.  It is as if the tank has done something of consequence and now lumbers on in some new realm or mad reality.  Although the song did engage my imagination it was more difficult to connect with emotionally.<br /><br />Lucky Man (4 stars)<br />the lyrics describe a man with women and wealth who performed his duty for his country and found death as ready to take him as anyone else less fortunate.  The haunting chorus underscores the lyric's irony.  The vocals sound Beatlesque.  The song ends as a synthesizer comes in and brings an electric energy that is taunting and haunting all at once.<br /><br />Album:<br />The often dense style of Emerson, Lake & Palmer is the best asset and greatest liability.  The songs on this album tend to succeed in balancing these things but not always so well.  The band's style of play lends itself to themes of madness and relentless motion.  The imaginative lyrics and themes seem concerned with dark spirits.  The darknessin this album is akin to that of King Crimson's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\".  Lake's vocalizations help to cut down on the density of the instrumentation.  This density tends to soure me to their music over time but I have found this album one that has suffered less from than than there other albums from the 70s.<br /><br />This album is an early progressive rock classic with exceptional musicianship combined with fantasy sound textures that transport you to another world and I recommend the album as a whole to prog rock fans.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />4 Star Songs (4/5 stars)<br />1.  Take a Pebble (4 stars)<br />2.  Knife Edge (4 stars)<br />3.  The Three Fates: Clotho/Lachesis/Atropos (4 stars)<br />4.

B002K0WBXW|3.0|While it has some very humorous moments, this movie was weak in the romance department.<br /><br />One major point was that Sandra Bullock seemed a bit old to be paired with her leading man. Now, I have no idea of their actual ages, but even the grandma in the movie (who did a great job, by the way) mentions, upon meeting her, that Sandra Bullock is no 'girl'. Ryan Reynolds' ex even seems years younger than Bullock.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that the woman must be younger than the man or anything like that. It's just that, other than Grandma's remarks, it was not something that was really brought up.  It just seemed like something that his family would have questioned, at least a little.<br /><br />It was still easy to see how Andrews (Reynolds) fell in love with Margaret (Bullock). I mean, he knew everything about her, almost, and learned even more during the weekend. All Bullock seemed to fall in love with was Andrew's family. She never did seem to really learn anything about him. In one scene, she finally shows some interest by asking him about his father. When Andrew refuses to answer, she talks about herself some more. I thought, \\"Okay, he's finally going to open up a bit.\\" Nope, he just talks about her some more and that's it.<br /><br />The 'look' saved this movie. Both Bullock and Reynolds were able to give and get that 'look' that says, \\"Oh, I think I'm falling in love with this person.\\"<br /><br />Bullock trying to feed the dog to the eagle was the absolute funniest scene in the movie. ;-)

0385504225|3.0|Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon travels to Washington DC to meet his old friend, mentor and prominent mason Peter Solomon.  Langdon is to deliver an evening lecture in the US Capitol Building.  On arrival he finds the severed right hand of his friend placed in the Capitol rotunda.  Yes, the night has taken a bizarre turn ... and the bizarreness keeps on happening right through to the end.<br /><br />Langdon's mission is to save Peter Solomon who has been kidnapped. This involves joining forces with Peter's sister Katherine, delving into Masonic secrets, and (of course) treading on the toes of the CIA.  Oh, and I must mention the new bad guy and Langdon's adversary: Mal'akh, the tattooed eunuch bodybuilder.<br /><br />I found this novel highly entertaining, in a very implausible way.  There is frenetic action galore, some interesting snippets of information about the Freemasonry and Washington DC.  A good escapist read for those of us who sometimes need and enjoy a novel that requires no commitment except for time.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith

0061914177|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - perfect for the entrepreneur and Internet junkie alike. \\"Crush It!\\" is conversational, fun, and a quick read - although it's packed with plenty of useful information for both newcomers and those experienced in the Internet alike. I consider myself to be well read in entrepreneurship, the Internet, social media, and marketing, however Gary Vaynerchuk provides plenty of information that I had not even come across prior to reading this book. His message is very similar to Seth Godin's [[ASIN:1591841003 All Marketers Are Liars: The Power of Telling Authentic Stories in a Low-Trust World]] which emphasizes the importance of authenticity and storytelling - however \\"Crush It\\" having just been released this year (2009) has more up-to-date and tactical advice for building your business via the Internet.<br /><br />\\"Crush It\\" reminded me quite a bit of [[ASIN:0307353133 The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich]] by Timothy Ferriss - check that one out once you've finished \\"Crush It\\" if you haven't done so already.

0316096199|3.0|It's hard to read, let alone review, a book about rape, but I think that this book it is an important one.  Lucky is a memoir about a college student who was attacked and raped in the park by her campus.  Despite its difficult subject matter, Lucky reads smoothly.  I feel that this is an accessible book for people to read who would like to understand better how to deal with rape, and to see all the ways that it impacts someone.<br /><br />For me there were four distinct parts of this book (although the writer did not designate them as such - it just felt to me to read like that).  The first part was the beginning, in which the actual rape sequence is told right up front.  It is hard to digest but is written very clearly and directly.  I really felt for the narrator in the next scenes, which immediately follow the rape, in which she goes to the police and is examined and has to tell her friends and family members what happened.  At one point she describes something that I imagine must be almost as horrible as the rape itself - having to live the rest of her life as a rape victim:<br /><br />\\"I knew exactly what had happened.  But can you speak those sentences to the people you love?  . . . That question continues to haunt me.  After telling the hard facts to anyone from lover to friend, I have changed in their eyes.\\"<br /><br />The second part of Lucky, for me, described the weeks and months following the rape.  I found this part to be lacking because it seemed to me that the narrator wasn't really dealing with her true feelings.  I suppose that that is how it actually happened, though, and she did a good job of making me feel like I was right there with her in that time and that space, even though I often wanted her to do things differently.  At times it seemed like she was pushing the rape out of her mind completely, and writing about her college classes and other things that any book about any college student would include.  I wanted her to focus more on the issue, but perhaps she dealt with it by not focusing on it.  In this part the theme of writing was introduced, which I did enjoy.  Sebold dealt with her emotions by writing poetry and fiction.  She took classes and seminars by Tobias Wolff and Tess Gallagher.  Tess Gallagher is actually a pretty central character in the book, who accompanies Alice to court when she has to confront her attacker (although she's disappeared by the end of the book without explanation, leaving me to wonder what happened).<br /><br />The third part of the book, which I really liked, moved on to show how the narrator was intent on prosecuting her attacker.  It was easy to cheer for her and she showed a lot of strength and wisdom.  She describes the legal process well and at one point she mentions wanting to go to law school so that she can prosecute other criminals (she later decides to pursue teaching instead, and says it became her lifeline and salvation).  It seems very fulfilling that the narrator finds some kind of justice and closure in the midst of all her suffering.  At the same time, she is still human. I could tell that the rape had affected her and that in some ways it had changed her in a negative way.  She seems to use men for own reasons and disregard what they must be feeling.  She has a strange relationship with her father that she never quite explores in depth the way I wanted her to.  (At times she has a close bond with her mother, who is always anxious and has panic attacks).  Through all of these shortcomings, however, for most of the book she seems strong and like someone to whom most readers would be able to relate, despite the horrible thing that happened to her.<br /><br />The fourth and last part of the book, though, takes a strange turn.  I don't want to include spoilers so suffice it to say that the narrator is no longer the intelligent, strong fighter that the reader had gotten to know and admire.  This made me feel like my hunch was correct that she hadn't been dealing internally with the aftermath of her rape.  I was disappointed at her downfall but, more than that, it didn't seem to make sense to me.  I thought that the writer should have spent more time on the last part of the book and less time with the mundane intricacies of college life.  I felt there were issues left unexplored in the book.<br /><br />Overall, I \\"enjoyed\\" reading Lucky, although that is a strange thing to say about a rape memoir.  I thought it was well-written and that it dealt with some very important social issues.  I especially liked how it explored the subject of how different women deal differently with rape, and the need for there to be open dialogue about it.  The writing in parts is flourishingly poetic, which was a strange offset for the subject, but it usually worked.  I would like to read another book by Alice Sebold to see whether the tone works even better with a lighter subject matter (although, from what I understand, her novel Her Lovely Bones has anything but a light subject matter).  I give Lucky three and a half stars and would recommend the book, but be forewarned that the subject matter is obviously difficult.<br /><br />For more book reviews and other posts of interest to readers and writers, please visit my Blogspot blog, Voracia: Goddess of Words.rape.

0061478784|5.0|Being a huge fan of the anime, I jumped at the chance to read the book. Normally, people automatically like what they experienced first, but I really loved it. While the movie and the book have their differences, I adore both of them as complimentary to one another.    With all the Harry Potter rage, I realize that most fantasy fiction aimed at YA audiences will inevitably be compared to the works of J.K. Rowling, but to be honest, watching those movies never compelled me to read her books. Just not interested...     I knew that the anime based on this book would leave out many details--as movies are apt to do--but I was enchanted enough by it to find out the rest. I'm so glad that I did.     The Howl and Sophie from the book are so much more fleshed out and flawed than in the movie--Sophie being more of a pain in Howl's butt and vice-versa. In my opinion, this makes them even more relatable. If you think you love the anime Howl, you haven't seen anything yet. The book Howl is way more charming in his sarcastic and shady way--if you have ever found yourself completely enamoured of someone whom you were simultaneously distrustful of, you'll get what I mean. The book Howl is that gorgeous and charming guy that you try to hate but can't say no to, written in a PG way. And let me tell you, I'm not normally the kind of reader with very much patience with overly PG books. This, however was a very imaginable, witty, and all-around enjoyable read.
0439023483|4.0|I very much enjoyed this post-apocalyptic book about a young girl, Katniss, who is forced into her society's once-a-year Hunger Games. Of 24 tributes who are elected, forced really, to enter the games, only one will survive, for the \\"game\\" is to hunt each other and battle until only one is left alive. The games are telecast to remind everyone of the ugliness of war. The Hunger Games is the first in a proposed series of books, and I look forward to the next in the series.

B002IKLZZY|4.0|Enough's been said about the quality of the movie. The two new documentary features that are included in this 2-disc edition include one on Hitchcock's style and one on Cary Grant. No quibbles with the Cary Grant one...very inclusive and people that actually worked with him sharing their views as well as many film clips from all his movies. The Hitchcock  documentary contains only limited clips from only certain movies and if you can imagine a documentary on Hitchcock with no clips from Psycho, Vertigo, The Birds, Rear Window, Rope, etc., then you might actually enjoy it. While interesting, I kept getting hit over the head with the fact that whomever did the documentary only had access to certain Hitchcock movies -- more than likely those that were probably available through the same seller as the 50th Anniversary DVD of North by Northwest. Very poor form on a moviemaker with such a stellar reputation as Hitchcock.
B0006N2EZ0|2.0|There are some parts of this movie that don't check for me.<br /><br />One major issue is that the screen writer clearly has an understanding for how race plays out in film, yet still deliberately creates a movie that is racially insensitive.  Typically, media is viewed seriously for subtle racist messages, and unfortunately, this movie fails although appearing to be just the opposite.<br /><br />Costner is presented as the hero for which the movie cannot do without.  He has a whole cast of sidekicks to help him to complete the task including the black limo driver that he recruits by informing him that if he doesn't become his side kick he will be killed because the \\"cocky black soffer\\" always dies by being in attentive.  The driver is a racial stereotype of a young lazy black man that has to be directed by a white superior.  The writer clearly understands that these racist roles are created for blacks but chooses to recreate bad roles for African Americans.  I do not know why.<br /><br />  The depiction of black women in this movie is also extremely poor.  Whitney Houstan is not just spoiled; she is sexually irresponsible.  She is a stereotype of a successful African American female.  In one screen she almost has sex with the man plotting to kill her because she is angry at her boyfriend Costner, and wants to make him jealous.  Her character is immature.  Her sister is so sexually dysfunctional that she attempts also to sleep with Costner even though she knows that she would be sleeping with her own sister's lover.  I have an issue with this.  Not only does it reproduce patterns of male domination (females cannot be trusted) it also depicts black females as being sexually immoral. Like Houstan, her camera sister is extremely immature and needs the guidance of a white male played by Costner.<br /><br />  The character of Rachel leaves much to be desired as far as a woman is concerned.  She is inconsiderate and abuses the people that work for her.  She also sexually harasses Costner and than tantrums on her own employee when he stops sleeping with her.  We are supposed to view that in line with her Leo character type, but her character is really just immature.  It doesn't make sense either since a singer as successful as the one she is playing would have to have a lot of discipline. The portrayal was just unfortunate.<br /><br />  Costner's character is the usual white male come to fix problems all the problems of irrational (black) people.  That Costner must in fact fix the mess made by these two sisters is reaffirmed when Rachel's sister ends up being the one behind the murder plot.  It is really just pitifully prejudice. Blacks cannot have legitimate threats against them without them really being about killing each other. Rachel's sister is jealous, murderous, and caddy.  The actress cast is one of the most beautiful minority women but she is in the role of a criminal that would kill her own sister over petty jealousy.  The story is really ridiculous, and sad to point out, but it is a racist movie.<br /><br />  I like Costner, but his character also needs tuning.  He is emotionally constipated to the point of being abusive. He beats up some man just for giving him lip.  He also jilts Houstan after sleeping with her, and this is supposed to some how prove that he is better at his job.  It just places him in the position of being in control rather than his female partner. That seems to be the main function of the scenes inclusion; a white male is always in control no matter how subordinate his position realistically would be.<br /><br />The interracial love story would be interesting if the couple did not break up at the end of the film for no appealing reason. Again, when viewed for a general pattern most of these interracial movies end the same way; the couple is delegitimized. The Bodygaurd is no exception. The problems with this film could have been corrected easily, by simply making Houstan more mature, removing the jilting scene as it doesn't make sense, and not breaking the couple apart at the end of film--the major change would also be not making another black person really behind the murder plot.reaking the couple apart at the end of film--the major change would also be not making another black person really behind the murder plot.
0380807343|4.0|Neil Gaiman has written a deliciously, wickedly scary book for children, very reminiscent of master children's book writer Roald Dahl. The heroine, young Coraline, is an explorer by her very nature. During a particularly boring day, Coraline borrows an old key from her mother and unmasks a door that leads her to a scary adventure that includes her \\"other mother,\\" a wicked, evil creation with button eyes who wants Coraline to live with her forever. In the course of the adventure, Coraline must rescue three children who have lost their souls to the \\"other mother\\" and also Coraline's very own parents, who have been taken captive. Along the way she meets a talking cat who becomes her dear friend and rescuer. I can't wait to read more of Neil Gaiman. He is most famous for his The Sandman comics, which have been wildly popular for years.

B002L9N4DS|5.0|Is there room on here to fit all of what Forrest Gump means to me and possibly others? Probably not!  Forrest Gump mixes so many styles of film in one movie it is incredible.  It is a comedy, drama, war movie, love story, one of spiritual enlightenment, but most importantly it is about a life.  We all walk this earth and from the beginning of our life, we grow, we laugh and love, we have pain and heartache, and eventually we die.  How will others remember us?  How in a positive way have we touched others during our life?      The Blu-Ray version of this film is like watching it again for the first time.  There are little things in the background that stand-out unlike the regular version.  The battle scene is visually striking.    In the play Hamlet, Hamlet is in the graveyard and comes across Yorrick's skeleton.  Yorrick was the king's jester and Hamlet spent a great time with him when he was younger.  As he holds his skull, he speaks the lines, \\"My gorge rises at it (his skull)\\" meaning his throat rises at it.  I always took this to mean his spirit was moved to the point of being choked up!  There are quite a few scenes in this film that bring me to that point.  To me these aren't superficial feelings, as in other films, but touches the spirit, and that is why I feel that Forrest Gump is more than a film, but a life lesson.
0385341008|4.0|This is one of the most charming, enjoyable books I've read in a long, long time. In my estimation it's right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird. I give it the highest of recommendations. If you're in the mood for a \\"gentle\\" read, one that illuminates the human spirit, I highly recommend The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. My only regret is that I can only read it for the first time once. I would love to have the experience all over again.
1932100660|5.0|Dr. Campbell was doing research in the \\"all dietary fat is bad\\" era.  This was also the era when America was being sold \\"Crisco\\" in huge vats, by the way.  Saturated fat has indeed been killing us, no doubt, as is what Campbell calls \\"sugary junk foods\\".  And No one would say that whole plants are not a healthy food source.  But does this mean we should eliminate all animal based foods from our diet?  That's the drumbeat of this book.  I find, however, the proof to support the extreme position to be very weak.<br /><br />There is a glaring problem with the \\"Lessons From China\\" chapter: high glycemic foods are never mentioned.  We hear about how the more affluent Chinese eat more meat, but if they have a few extra bucks for meat, wouldn't they buy more bread, cakes and cookies?  My advice for people who still want to read this book, would be to add \\"and high glycemic foods\\" every time the phrase \\"animal based protein\\" is mentioned in the context of human diet, because the reality is that if you have more money, it's silly to think that 100% of it will be spend on meat alone.  I suspect that the more affluent, less healthy, Chinese subjects not only consumed more animal-based foods, they also consumed more high gylcemic foods.  The book just doesn't reveal (or the study did not uncover) what's really required: How do the two groups compare on high glycemic food intake?  On transfat intake?  Were the affluent Chinese subjects eating as much Crisco as Americans were?  If so, you don't need to be blaming animal protein!<br /><br />On the topic of dietary fat, we get the old-school nutrition establishment party line to cut fat, without an offer of where to get the replacement calories (how many pounds of spinach leaves can you eat?). I think it's irresponsible to advise eating no animal based products, and also eating no fat, to Americans that have 1000 high-glycemic choices for every one whole plant based choice.  What do they think is going to happen?  Haven't the authors heard of the \\"Snackwells Effect\\"?<br /><br />On the topic of human blood cholesterol levels, we read \\"With almost no exceptions, nutrients from plant-based foods were associated with decreasing levels of blood cholesterol.\\"  Really?  Was is the plant-based foods, or was it lack of high glycemic foods?  I urge people who are interested in books like this one to read Gary Taubes' \\"[[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories]]\\", the premise of which is that cholesterol levels are most often worsened not by eliminating meat, but by eliminating high glycemic foods.  Taubes is a science writer who combed the research papers and tells a compelling story about why so much of the nutrition establishment is stuck in the 1950's.<br /><br />Dr. Campbell says, \\"There are snake oil salesmen ... and there are scientists...\\" I agree that the laboratory research Dr. Campbell mentions in the book was certainly of great value to understanding some specific mechanisms of cancer.  And he goes on to say \\"...scientists who have formal training, conducted research, and have reported on their findings in professional forums.\\"  What he didn't say, and the I would add is \\"...and so have a lot riding on keeping consistent, even at the expense of ignoring new research that suggests problems with the old way of thinking.\\"  And although Dr. Campbell takes on the scientist persona when it comes to his laboratory research, it seems that he and his son are trying to cash-in on the whole plant-based diet thing.  Maybe not as blatant as other pitch men, but I don't see that much difference between these authors and the diet gurus; they all believe in what they are saying, and they use the opportunity to cash-in on it.<br /><br />So although I value the research Dr. Campbell did in understanding cancer mechanisms, I think he is doing a disservice to the collective health of American by continuing to espouse the old-school nutrition establishment party line.\\"Snackwells Effect\\"?

B00005QK3W|4.0|The utmost repect is due to Sir Paul MaCartney. Through a decade of artistic inirtia, and more dire, the death of his beloved and then a bitter divorce, the world's best bass player has picked himself up, dusted himself off, and made some of the most vital art of his career.<br />Flamming Pie may have gotten the ball rolling, but as to Driving Rain, well, frankly, he has not been this inspired since Band On The Run.<br /><br />This is defiantely a collection of Paul tracks, with all the tight writting and perfect production. But listen to the organ on \\"Tiny Bubble,\\" his bass on the title track, or the long jam near the end of the album. The planning is careful, but the execution is loose and fuled by the love for playing that got lost on 80s albums such as Press To Play or even as late as 1993s Off The Ground. Like rain driving down from the sky, the songs here fall by chance, but always land dead on target.<br /><br />Speaking of Driving Rain, listen to the title track's lyrics: \\"Why Don't We Drive In Rain/Straight Through The Eye Of The Hurricane. 12345 Let's Go For A Drive.\\"<br /><br />No, this is no silly love song or a quiant drive in the country. Paul has suffered loss, and is trying to get OK again. This is no mop top driving in his car--this is a man and an artist trying to find an accpetable shape of life again after the unbareable.<br /><br />Paul has, classically, been accused of being trival and quint, and to a large degree, the critics were right. Listen to Speed Of Sound--great playing and little to say. It is hard to beleive this is the same guy who listened to Biero and Stockhausen and hung out with Billy DeKoning.<br /><br />Then turn to Tiny Bubble on this album, where Paul says \\"You can't imagine what I've been going through/I would not wish this on a soul much less you.\\" These are adult concerns spoken by an adult to other adults. Paul's ability to express emotions so sincerely and with complete simplicity is astounding.<br /><br />So many years have passed, that little B word need not enter the conversation. If we collectively have not already, it is time to see all of Paul's work after 1970 as its own entinty. It may be spotty, it may have many pot holes.<br /><br />But the fact that McCarteney has surrivived it all and is making some of his most vital music at nearly 70--music that puts everything into a context that helps him still thrive-- is a testimony to his greatness as an artist. Driving Rain is this artist at his peak, some of his most subtanative work since.................what was the name of that band again?e conversation.

B00004W221|5.0|I have to admit that for as long as this movie has been out, I hadn't seen it until recently.  I was throughly impressed.  Yes, a movie script is going to be different from reality because they have to fit years of actual experience into something under two hours; however, I thought it was done very, very well.<br /><br />The special interviews were fantastic to watch after viewing the movie and realizing that many of the elements that I wondered were true or not actually were true.  If you haven't seen it, I won't give it away, but watch the special features and you may be surprised.<br /><br />You can search YouTube to watch the actual footage of the last few minutes of the game in which Rudy played.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite sports movie (and there are some good ones out there).  I love how the movie depicts years and years of hard work leading up to his dream whereas other sports movies, the team or player become whipped into shape during one short season.<br /><br />Great movie.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Not going to repeat what most others have already said. Snow White's PQ and AQ are just awesome on this transfer. Perfect way to present to your little ones or older crowd who may have seen the film many of times. Watching this transfer of the film on a good HD set up with surround is just a totally new experience. Remember the aspect ratio is not the typical 16:9 so you'll have bars on each side of the screen, although Disney has put some thought into it and you can enable a feature that replaces the plain black bars with pictures that blend into the movie. Can't go wrong with this one. Disney, keep them coming!

With a script and dialogue written by a Japanese robot and  a desire by the end of the 'film' to see Brangelina lined  up against a wall and shot, avoid this tripe at all costs.  Defecate instead. One star only for the musical score, zero  for the rest.
B000068QVN|5.0|I was one who was priviledged to see GFR live when they performed in Chicago. It would have been in 1970 or so.  I can still remember the concert, the standing in line, etc.  It was well worth it and the show was fantastic. This album brings back to mind all those memories. I was an avid fan of the early GFR all the way through their first albums up to Phoenix.  It was in their later albums that I drifted away.  It seemed that they begin a shift from the hard rock that was their forte into the lighter \\"kid rock\\" sound. This was not my kind of music and I just drifted away. I never did understand the complete rift between GFR and Terry Knight, but think their first 6 albums their best. I was glad to find this and have no hesitation recommending it to anyone who loves the classic GFR.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|Loved the movie! Long time fans of the franchise should be happy because this is clearly a set up for future installments!!!
B00164GDD2|4.0|First keep in mind how old this film is and the style of movie they were making at the time. There is \\"some\\" noticeable grain in the movie but it's meant to be there, without it the movie would just loose a lot of it's original feel or place in it's era of movies. That said, Ghostbusters on blu ray is just the best transfer this film has seen to date. No, this won't be one I'll use to show off my setup or as a demo but it still looks far better the any of the previous releases. My kids had not seen this movie yet so this gave us a perfect chance to sit down and watch it with them. Sounds great through surround sound, if you loved the film then.....no reason why you won't fall for it again.
0312427999|1.0|The Shock Doctrine is a dangerous book for it may taint the minds of those who lack a basic knowledge of history and elementary economics. It may fool those who are naïve, those who take every written word for fact.  I fear for a generation of young adults who will grow up on completely misconstrued propaganda in the belief that what authors like Ms Klein write has anything to do with fact, reality and the way the world works.  It is a shame, as the views, morals and values of the masses impact us all.  That's why the shocking lies in this book need to be exposed for what they are.      One of the accolades for the book on its back cover reads \\"If you only read one non-fiction book this year, make it this one\\".   This scares me, and should be of concern to all; but it probably also summarizes who the author had in mind when writing this book.  I am not surprised, as anyone not fitting this group should find Ms Klein's work a glaring and complete delusion to truth, history and economics.      This is a shockingly wrong book; it is wrong on so many levels, not just the complete mischaracterisation of history and facts.  But those errors are straightforward to refute, and many commentators have pointed those out.  Of a deeper concern for the welfare of humanity are Ms Klein's ideological obfuscations.  What Ms Klein's work mounts to, is a disguised praise for Communism, for what else can her passages imply?  She seems to be in favour of a \\"right to work, to decent housing\\"; she seems to support land re-distribution and debt forgiveness.  What about property rights Ms Klein?  What about the fact that resources are finite and men have to compete for those resources?  That is the reality we face; while it appears, Ms Klein is striving for ideological utopia, which by the way has been tried, tested and failed (I know as I come from a country that tried; involuntarily I might add).  If Ms Klein is a disguised supporter of Communism as it appears, it is totally baffling that she uses quotes from George Orwell's \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" to illustrate the ills of free markets. How illogical. Those quotes warn about the dangers of Communism and tyranny, not free markets.  It makes me wonder if Ms Klein wrote this book with an understanding of socio-economics and with a careful intention to manipulate facts, or if she does not herself understand what she is writing.  I doubt the second possibility, but am truly surprised by the insertion of such ill suited quotes.      Ms Klein: military dictatorships are not libertarian free market economies.  They are fascist states. Of course they use coercion, torture and abuse.  That's how fascist states are run. Don't confuse them for what Mr Friedman stood for.  Torture is not a \\"silent partner\\" of free markets.  It is a tool of fascist dictators.      The most far fetched, outrageous, illogical and simply incomprehensible arguments of Ms Klein involve her extension of the word \\"shock\\" as applied to torture, to economic \\"shock therapy\\". Just because the same word is present in the two phrases, does not mean that they mean the same thing.  Have those praising The Shock Doctrine realised that fact?  The two \\"shocks\\" which she uses interchangeably, are anything but the same thing. The behaviour of agonising pain applied to defenceless individuals is abhorable.   That does not mean that the adaptation of individuals to a free market economy has anything remotely to do with it.  I can assure you, that most real proponents of free markets do not take pleasure in ripping out other men's fingernails, or applying electric shocks to someone's body.  Don't use universally tarnished and denounced examples of behaviour to blame a philosophy that has been developing for two centuries and has marked the greatest progress of human civilization.    Why does Ms Klein not move to North Korea or Venezuela? I am sure she would feel right at home there, in her little socialist paradise.

B001UV4XWO|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect from this movie considering the fact that Richard Kelly's last movie, \\"Southland Tales,\\" kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. But upon the finished viewing of his latest film, \\"The Box,\\" I think he has returned to the form that made me fall in love with \\"Donnie Darko.\\" What a totally cerebral experience. A movie that jumps from a military experiment gone array to a noir thriller to a bout of existential looks at the causes and effects of free will and finally to a bit of theological looks at life after death. This movie completely and unequivocably held my attention throughout as any great director can do with a fantastic story. I've read quite a lot of reviews that just bomb this movie due to its confusing plot but I, for one, believe that this is highly enjoyable cinematic experience. I couldn't recommend this movie more.
B000LPS3B2|4.0|There's a kind of mental checklist I write up whenever I sit down to watch an Asian horror movie. One, girl ghost with long hair over her face. Two, water. Three, revenge. Four, empathy with the villain. Five, a twist.    I actually got \\"Shutter\\" in the same delivery as \\"The Ghost\\", and while both movies certainly have all of the above criteria in common, and both are ultimately formulaic and on-rails, \\"Shutter\\" is hands-down the superior film, for a number of reasons.    It's also an excellent movie without any comparisons to go on. The first and most notable quality which \\"Shutter\\" has is a decided sense of contrast. There's a definite sense of low-budget amateurism in the production values, and this is offset by sleek, tense direction and a very compelling central performance by Ananda Everingham. The result is a horror film that feels more real and honest than its contemporaries, and, given that we're walking on some very familiar ground with the subject matter, this realism is a very important asset.     The special effects are kept to a bare minimum - directors Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom show great courage, in this age of OTT effects-laden dreck, by actually using their skill behind a camera to create the fear for us. There's a lot of good old-fashioned JUMP!! moments on offer, but \\"Shutter\\" keeps the tension going in-between these parts, by never letting the action drag or the tension disappear. Which is a brave gamble - the constant sense of dread could have become very old, very fast - but somehow \\"Shutter\\" engages us from the first frames and keeps us engaged until the credits roll.    The use of sound - ambient sound, screams, offscreen effects - is very clever, and very effective - a lot more so than in many horror films. Suphot Raksa's sense of aural storytelling is an ideal compliment to the director's visual sense, and the sparse, straightforward dialogue provides a utilitarian method of delivering a fairly straightforward plot.     Besides Everingham giving an excellent performance as the hero Tun, there's a general high standard of acting on offer - even the more minor roles like Tun's girlfriend Jane, or his best pal Tonn, are well-crafted characters. Besides Everingham, nobody stands out, but then, nobody's got as much screen time as him, either.    I will not write any plot spoilers, but be assured - if, like me, your Asian horror fix has been neglected of late (frankly I stopped watching because they all got a little... ...samey), \\"Shutter\\" is absolutely worth your time. While it is very similar to a lot of entries in this particular genre of horror, and is, at its heart, unoriginal, it's also an elegant, well-made and genuinely frightening film. On the other hand, if \\"Saw\\" and \\"Scream\\" are more your style, stay away from this one. \\"Shutter\\" is an acquired taste, but for those of us who like this sort of thing, it's definitely superior.     Recommended.

B00006IUL6|4.0|I should say that the fact that the sun doesn't set for months becomes a major theme in the film, coupled with the question of just what is the behavior that a good cop will expect of him-or herself. Al Pacino gives a bravura performance as the cop who suffers from insomnia due to the sun and whose actions in the past and present lead him to question his self-conception as a good cop. He is ably abetted by Swank and Williams, with the supporting roles being filled well. There is some action, some talk, some scenery, and no sleep. All in all, an above average effort to portray The Detective and The Criminal. Good watching.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|The DVD is in extremely good condition and plays very well.  The difficulty is getting the thing going in the first place -- more often than one would expect.    How do I know that it's this DVD?  It's the only one that gives me this problem.    Delightful movie.
B001CC7PP8|5.0|I remember watching Psycho on TV when I was around 12-13 years old. I still remember the shocking parts well. 25 years later I thought that I remembered it so well that I wasn't particularly interested in re-watching it. Anyway, finally I bought the 'Universal Legacy Series' edition DVD, and I'm glad for it. First of all, the transfer/picture quailty of this DVD is fantastic (just like Vertigo in the same series). I watched it on a projector. And the movie is far better than I remembered, the actors are excellent and the black/white photography superb. Ok, you can always make a remark about the explanatory psychiatric speech in the end, but this was a requirement at the time to get it through the censorship! This, and other fascinating things, is explained in the interesting commentary track, well worth listening to after watching the film.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|An eye-opener!  A must-see movie that will get you thinking about many issues besides the food and its industry- like  power, justice, and truth in this world.  Unbelievable.  Despite the heartbreaking stories about how farmers are being bullied and put out of business, there are many positive messages shared like how changes in attitude toward organic and 'natural' food has become mainstream and an extremely profitable industry.
031286504X|5.0|Excellent SF by Richard Matheson. In an alternative present or near future the human civilization has been destroyed by a virus that turns people into vampires. The story focuses on Robert Neville, maybe the only human who seems to be immune. On the days he drives around the empty city looking for resources and make his house/stronghold more resistant. In the night the vampires arrive and try to break in. The story is very well written and full of suspense. And very dark. Not exactly a feelgood book.<br />Mathesons' novel was made into a movie in 1970: \\"Omega Man\\" with Charlton Heston in the role of Neville. The film is very well worth watching, if just to compare with the novel. There are many differences which is interesting. (Also \\"I am Legend\\" was recently made into a film by some Hollywood studio with Will Smith as Neville. I haven't seen it but I really don't think it is as dark as the novel, or half as interesting.)
B001CDLATE|5.0|This Blu-ray version is simply outstanding, incredible, breathtaking and mesmerizing. I rarely recommend people buy a film but this one is truly worth every penny. If it were $50 or more I'd buy it. You can find many stories if you like in this film or none at all. I know it sounds shallow to simply watch it for the eye/ear candy but you can do that and walk away very satisfied. The cinematography, the editing, the music, the scenery, the flow is all beyond words. This is the way this film was meant to be. I bought the first DVD version years ago and it was a sheer piece of junk. I hesitated before purchasing this because some people had praised the first DVD and it was awful. This is the way the film was meant to be shown. The care and the quality that went into the scanning can be seen from the very first frame. So many older documentaries have been converted to Blu-ray and look horrible once you've seen the BBC's Planet Earth (many older films were not even properly cleaned so you see many artifacts like cracks, dust etc). Not in this version (ok, if you look very closely I think I found a few small dust artifacts in a couple of frames but barely noticeable).     Look, stop reading. Buy it and forget about it no matter the cost. This is the film I always imagined it should be. It is truly amazing that this film was shot in 1992. It looks like a modern BBC Hi-def production. Actually it's of an even better quality. You can tell that the people who did the re-mastering spent a great deal of time and effort to make this a reality. If I could give it 6 stars, this film would get it.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|I loved the first three books in this series, but book four is definitely a disappointment. Most of the interesting characters from the earlier books are left out of this book; the most compelling plot lines from book three are left unresolved; a whole new, seemingly irrelevant plot with new characters in another country is introduced; we spend most of our time with Jaime and Cersei, whose introspections become frankly tedious; and pretty much nobody seems to get anywhere. The book feels like a holding pattern.    Most disappointing of all was to reach the end of book four and find out that book five isn't published, and quite possibly never will be. With all due respect to the author, who is clearly a terrific writer, this book adds little value to the series and its content should have been left to wait for the more interesting material to be done, if ever.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Like Elizabeth Taylor said, \\"this film cements Michael's genious\\". The film is gorgeously shot and the sound is awesome. Definitely worthy of some technical Academy Awards. Michael's thrilling to watch even practicing his dancers and band. This Is It was going to be absolutely amazing and it's a huge loss to the world that we didn't get to see it. After watching this film, there's no doubt in my mind that Michael could have done the 50 shows in London...the master that he was. Can't wait to see what's in the DVD extras!
B002OR18HQ|5.0|I own about 200 DVD concerts and this ranks among the best. From the opening new uptempo rocker \\"Comin' Down the Road\\" (catchy, instantly likable) to the encore that includes \\"Travellin' Band\\", \\"Rockin' All Over the World\\" and \\"Proud Mary\\" Fogerty belies his age (62 I believe at the time of the show, June 2008). Fogerty is backed by a superb band that includes Kenny Aronoff, arguably the top drummer in rock and roll today - if you need to be persuaded, scroll to \\"Ramble Tamble\\", a CCR gem from Cosmos Factory. In addition to CCR standards \\"Born on the Bayou\\", Fortunate Son\\", \\"Down on the Corner\\", \\"Commotion: and \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\" Fogerty samples great songs from his solo career, including \\"Almost Saturday Night\\" from 1975 and a superb \\"Blue Ridge Mountain Blues\\" from his underappreciated Blue Ridge Rangers album. There isn't a weak song in the entire 28 song set. The audio is top notch, and the video equally so. If you are a fan of classic rock and roll you must own this concert.

0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins                                     Review by David Kelley    Katniss Everdeen runs from her starting spot. She sees the tributes fighting for supplies. As a boy is stabbed in front of her she sprints toward the woods. This scene takes place in The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. This is a fiction book with 374 pages. Someone should read this book if they are looking for an easy book that is filled with action.        The Hunger Games is a story that takes place in the ruins of North America. For the game two tributes are chosen from each of the twelve districts; the twelve districts belong to the nation of Panem. The tributes are sent to the capital to be trained for the game. Then the tributes are put in a large arena with a forest and lake. The tributes have to fight and kill each other until there is only one tribute alive. The games usually last for many days.      Katniss is a tribute this year who is playing in the game. Her sister Prim had originally been chosen, but Katniss volunteered to save her younger sister.  Now Katniss has found herself in a game where she will be playing for her life. Katniss is really skilled when it comes to survival techniques. She Lives in district 12 which is the poorest district, and it doesn't have a lot of food for everyone. Katniss has hunted for food in the forest outside the nation for a long time, and she has leaned how to survive in a forest. Katniss is also skilled in archery from her experience in hunting. She will have to put her skills to the test to win the game.       This book is really worth reading. I would give this book a ten out of ten. Suzanne Collins is very descriptive in her writing, and it is easy to visualize all of the scenes in your head. Someone should read this book because it is filled with action and has an intense plot. This is an extraordinary book.
B0012GMWI4|5.0|This album is a great listen from begining to end. Quite dear to my heart.
1400095204|4.0|4 and a half stars.<br /><br />This story, in short, is about war and loss, about what people/neighbors can do to each other; its about the 'conquer and divide' strategy and how people pretend everything's allright when it's far from it. The setting is Nigeria in the 1960s, right before the civil war happened between the Hausu Muslims and the Igbo Christians that resulted in the new state, Biafra, and what happened after it.<br /><br />Olanna and Kaiene - Two twins who just got back from London after finishing their Masters degree. Their father is a 'Big Man' and they are quickly welcomed back in the upper society. The twins were at one time close, but somehow their relationship isn't what it used to be. Unidentical in both looks and personality, Olanna is more of a people's person, trying to please her parents in everything while her twin is more aloof and cynical.<br /><br />Richard - a young Brit who comes to Nigeria to write about ancient pottery and jewellery. He falls in love with Kaiene and finds that for the first time he's found a place he feels he can belong to.<br /><br />Ugwu - a young teenage villager who works for Odenigbo, a Mathematics proffesor at Nsukka university, gets attached to the family he works for and is given a chance to go to school.<br /><br />The prose was beautiful, and I was caught between admiring it and feeling wretched at what it was describing. The depictions of the horrors of the war were very real and heartbreaking. I would have probably given this book a 5 stars + heart had I read it in different circumstances. I started this by the end of October but then came down with swine flu. I couldn't finish the book but I dreamt a lot about it. Seems like the books I have been reading lately are very nightmares-inducing.
0393316041|3.0|the first and last few chapters are a bore , but the middle of the book has some funny moments that made reading it  almost worth it. (maybe).  I just  can't figure out how so many people give this book a 5 star rating?  to  many chapters are just boring musing from Feynman about some speech he gave at some university or how he played the bongo for awhile.  for a nobel prize winning physicist  who worked on the manhatten project with greats like Oppenheimer and Neils Bohr,  I thought he would have something more interesting to say.  but his memory from working on the project is mostly of picking locks, and aggravating the security by childishly coding his letters to his wife just to see if he can sneek a coded letter by them.  one low point comes when he recalls a conversation with bohr by saying Bohr asked about an idea he had  blah  blah blah !  and then I said blah blah blah.  I'm  sorry , but I don't think you can blah blah blah  a great physicist like Bohr without leaving the reader with the feeling that a great moment was just missed.  haven't read any other books by Feynman and for me one was enough.
0141040378|4.0|Jane Austen has a way of writing that pulls you in, or at least for me.<br />Sense and Sensibility is about two sister struggling through the trials of relationships, and doing their best to keep their senses. I specifically liked this copy because of its look. The cover and design is simply beautiful, and that of an older book you'd find in a forgotten bookstore. I saw many copies of this book, but this one caught my eye.
B0000A118M|5.0|I have been listening to jazz since the 1950s, when my dad used to play his jazz albums (Stan Kenton, Dave Brubeck, Jazz Messengers, et al) on his new-fangled HiFi set, nevertheless it took me repeated listenings to \\"A Love Supreme\\" to finally recognize the true genius behind it.  This is a subtle textured album that draws the listener in to it.  It must be listened to in its entirety to fully appreciate it.   The original tracks that is - the \\"bonus\\" extra tracks are not as good to my ears and frankly, detract from the enjoyment of the CD.  Probably my second favorite jazz album next to the Miles Davis classic \\"Kind of Blue\\".
0452289963|5.0|With all sincerity, this book helped in the permanent transformation of my consciousness.  I cannot recommend it highly enough to those seeking enlightenment (or wanting to go to heaven, become one with God, awaken, etc.).  It doesn't present concepts that will necessarily be new to the reader.  However, the way in which these ideas are presented allows you to actually become that which you have sought to become.  By the time I finished reading page thirteen, my life was changed forever.  As Eckhart Tolle describes his book, it is a tool. I recommend this book to everyone on a spiritual path, which is everyone.

B0001GMIOE|1.0|I looked hard to find a genuine Canon replacement battery, since most 3rd party batteries are bad news.  This one was so expensive I thought it had to be authentic. It arrived 4 days late. I question the authenticity of this \\"Canon\\" battery - Cheap cardboard packaging had faded colors, instructions on paper of low quality, the label on the battery was a faded off-color, not like any of my OEM Canon parts, there was no punched hold in the cheap plastic tray to use orientation to indicate charged/not.  I can't prove this is a knock-off counterfeit - but even the \\"hologram\\" looks fake.  I have more faith when Amazon does the fulfillment directly, and I thus hesitate to use 3rd parties for this category of product.  Sorry if I'm wrong, it just a bad feeling based on my above observations.
0930289234|5.0|I don't expect anyone to read this review with so many others out there, but I wanted to put my own vote for my favorite graphic novel of all time. Other reviews do a great job detailing the pluses and minuses of the series, so no reason to expand upon those here.<br /><br />I consider Watchmen to be more about the journey than the destination. Alan Moore is one of the greatest storytellers of his generation, no matter the medium, and this story shows off his talents. Every chapter is expertly designed, and every chapter is very entertaining.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is the best graphic novel of all time. You might think comic books are for kids (and many are), but this proves why not all of them are. It's one of the greatest stories ever told, and a graphic novel is the only way it could be presented. It is intricate and entertaining, and every time I read it I notice something new.<br /><br />You don't have to be a comics fan to love this book. You just have to enjoy good story-telling.
1592332803|5.0|The pictures in this book make you want to try the recipes. After you try the recipes, they are so good that you want to try the recipes that don't have pictures.

It has been great fun so far. I have started a new \\"Dinner Club\\" and we are only cooking from this book. It should be great fun!

B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is not related to the thousands of other anime films out there. Miyazaki is a storyteller first and foremost, weaving dramatic, comedic tales. Spirited Away, and most of the other Studio Ghibli films, are made pretty much - for everyone. If you're between 8 and 100 years old, you'll probably enjoy this film.  Depending on your age, you'll see a slightly different film.  Spirited away combines traditional Japanese culture, post war culture, 90s culture, magic, spirits...  no robots or space creatures in this one and although Miyazaki touches on Steampunk in some of his other films, there's not really any in this film.  Everyone I've ever shared this film with, young and old, has absolutely loved it.  Miyazaki's use of children (or childlike characters) in the lead roles - and the fact that his films are animated, leads a lot of people to assume that these are films for children, and while they are great for children, they are certainly not kid movies.  Highly suggested.

0316044938|5.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a creative, complex book deftly handled by Alice Sebold.  Already a Sebold fan from her memoir \\"Lucky\\" she didn't disappoint me with Susie's story. It examines the impact a rape and murder of a young girl has on her family as the years go on after this horrible event. It's not pretty.  It sends each member into a long, horrible tailspin.  Will any of them recover? Is this time on earth all we have? Does love transcend death? Susie Salmon (like the fish) is an intriguing, multi-dimensional look at life, death and what goes on beyond the two. The first person account makes the story even more personal and intimate.  The re-release of the book ties in with next month's movie directed by Peter Jackson (Rings Trilogy).  If you have enjoyed Lisa See's book[[ASIN:0812975227 Peony in Love: A Novel]] this one is a must read.
0143038419|1.0|I am so glad to see that I am not the only woman in the world who found this to be a dull, contrived and tedious  read. I attmepted not once, not twice, but three times to convince myself that this was, in fact, a good read. Gilbert's attmepts at humor are forced and annoying, her narrative voice somehow nasal and irritating. I made it about 2/3 of the way through and couldn't take another word. Life-changing for some...torturous for others. Count me in the latter.
B0001VV1GK|4.0|We received the Plan Toy Garage as a gift and our 3 year old LOVES it. He can fill up his little cars with gas, make them go up and down the elevator, and really enjoys his cars going down the ramp. We were disappointed that only 1 car came with the toy, especially since the picture depicts so much more on the box.  Also disappointed that the car doesn't have a hole where the gas pump can fit, our toddler was asking for one.     We have bought the helicopter, another set of 3 cars and a set of 3 trucks from Plan Toy. All are great little wooden cars with nice rubbery wheels. We LOVE that this company is green and is painted with child safe paint- two things that we always look for in a toy.     We are looking forward to purchasing the other sets to accompany this one and hope they come out with a table for the entire set.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|The song styling of this album is more up-tempo and is a great mix of what's popular on the air waves right now and that uniquely smooth, vibrant Backstreet Boys sound that makes this album a real treat.           The following are my personal favorites:       Masquerade is simply fascinating and with a slick sound that is mesmerizing. The lyrics and vocal harmonies of Shattered and Undone are heartfelt, mature, and gorgeous. Straight Through My Heart, Bigger, and This Is Us all have a really catchy, upbeat, addictive sound that you ~WILL~ find yourself singing along to, just like I found myself doing.     This Is Us is among my best music purchases this year.^^
B000KX0IOA|4.0|Gandhi has been widely recognized by many world-wide as a worshipful tribute to one of the 20th century's greatest leaders. The film opens with a statement from the filmmakers explaining their approach to the problem of filming Gandhi's complex life story \\"No man's life can be encompassed in one telling... least of all Gandhi's, whose passage through life was so entwined with his nation's struggle for freedom. There is no way to give each event its allotted weight, to recount the deeds and sacrifices of all the great men and women to whom he and India owe such immense debts. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record of his journey, and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man.\\" The film begins with Gandhi's assassination on January 30, 1948, and his funeral. After an evening prayer, an elderly Gandhi is helped out for his evening walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers. Gandhi was highly portrayed as private and humble man, a thing which was so well exemplified by the actor playing Gandhi. The actor truly reflected the tender care of Gandhi. His dialogue is not extensive, nor does he engage in long, rambling speeches. His eyes speak humility, his movements speak love. He is the embodiment of everything Gandhi was, or was supposed to have been, without the need for showy displays of acting talent or loudly proclaimed diatribes.  The political story told by Ganhi seemed pretty unintelligible to me, and I never got much of a sense of what Gandhi was like as a man. But I don't believe Attenborough had much interest in those aspects of the story; I think he wanted to tell an inspirational tale about one of the most unusual men in world history. As U.S. Secretary of State George C. Marshall said, \\"Mahatma Gandhi has become the spokesman for the conscience of all mankind. He was a man who made humility and simple truth more powerful than Empires.\\"
1848441614|5.0|\\"HUMAN RIGHTS\\": SO WHY THE ONGOING CONTROVERSY?<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />In this thought provoking addition to human rights scholarship, Andrew Fagan offers a minutely analytical approach to this often controversial subject.<br /><br />If you are supportive of the principles of human rights, however, as are most of us, you may well wonder why human rights should be at all controversial. Surely, one would argue, as the American revolutionaries did in 1776, that such rights are `inalienable.'  We are all human; we should all have the right to rights, so where does the controversy lie?<br /><br />Unfortunately, if we can be forgiven for making a sweeping general statement, such rights are dismissed, ignored or sometimes deliberately violated throughout the world, particularly in areas of the world where the word `democracy' strikes terror in the cynical hearts of dictatorial, repressive and/or incompetent governments.<br /><br />For this and a number of other reasons, Fagan points out that the foremost myth - that we live in an age of human rights -- stands in need of correction, `This age has yet to arrive,' he says, `as evidenced by the countless millions, if not billions, of human beings whose basic human rights are systematically denied every waking day of their lives.'  We can only enter a genuine age of human rights, he adds, `when we have committed ourselves to...securing the conditions required for a world finally free from the effects of systematic misery and avoidable suffering.'<br /><br />Thus does Fagan rather heroically set out to examine and quite often dispel the myths and misunderstandings which often obscure and distort both the theory and practice of human rights and, in so doing, erect barriers to their successful realisation.<br /><br />Following a lively examination, for example, of certain `ethnocentric' objections to human rights, Chapter 6 is particularly interesting in the context of certain democracies where human rights legislation stands in need of a little fine tuning.  Here, the author focuses on the misunderstandings concerning the relationship between rights and duties. Duties and -- might we add, responsibilities -- have a necessary role in `the possession and effective exercise of any human right', he says.  They are not `a mere afterthought.'<br /><br />This is a thorough and balanced work which examines the philosophical basis of human rights and tackles head on, the most commonly held suspicions and misconceptions - some of them politically motivated and deliberate - of human rights theory.  If you specialize professionally or academically in the area of human rights legislation or even practical application, you'd find it useful to read this book, but you will probably raise your own controversies by doing so!<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-84844-161-3human rights legislation stands in need of a little fine tuning.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|It was beyond anything that I expected to see. I was actually shocked and suprised that it was so good. So good, that it left me speechless.  All I could say was, \\"Wow\\"! when I walked out of the theatre. I couldn't imagine they would put something together so smoothly using clips from backstage scenes. Much of it appeared just as it would on stage in full costumes. Jackson appeared so frail and yet, he moved pretty good for a 50 year old guy who hadn't performed in quite a few years. He still seemed to have what it takes. The whole thing was quite a pleasant surprise to me. It was so good that I had to go back the next week and watch it all over again.  The second time I saw it, I still said, \\"Wow\\"! What more could one say? It was all very well done. Beautiful tribute to the man.
0380799006|5.0|This book is fantastic and one of two books that I refer to repeatedly as a parent.  I have already experienced many of the book's examples and my boys are only 3 and 6!  The bottom line is that doing what SEEMS logical and right in the situation as a parent isn't always perceived that way by the children.  The book gives very clear and sometimes surprising examples of what works or doesn't and why.  I have given Siblings Without Rivalry as gifts to some close friends.    My husband is from a family of 5 boys with disfunctional relationships running amuck due to a Lord of the Flies upbringing.  I wanted a proactive way to stop the rivalry at the start, i.e., the birth of my second boy. If read front to back, the book makes a lot of sense.  Although some reviewers complained about the comic strips being condescending, i found that the repetition with the pictures (comic strips) gave me a better ability to remember and recall when needed.  Life is more like a comic strip than a narration.    Good luck in creating peace in your home!
B002NXSRVG|1.0|The acting is bad, the writing is bad, and I was wish with all the destruction in the movie the entire cast of characters would blow each other apart. The special effects contradict themselves by being really good and really bad. The acting on the other hand is constant in it's blandness. Skip this movie, and if you watch it and love it, don't tell anyone so they don't think you're 5.    You know there's a sequel coming so hey \\"Hollywood people\\", please fire the director and the rest of the cast and get some real talent in there.
0385504225|2.0|I'll keep this short compared to the \\"novels\\" of other reviewers. I'm no writer but I am an avid reader. I was #15 on the wait list at our public library (and I'm a board member)for this book. The anticipation for this read was agonizing. I loved DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons so it was my own fault that my expectations were so high. It was a disappointment. This book dragged on so long I found myself skipping whole paragraphs in an effort to get through it. While some passages were interesting (the study of noetic science)much was deadly boring and a waste of paper. I think (know)Dan Brown can do better, he has already proven it. Don't let the critics frighten you and don't take everything so seriously. The first two books were awesome reads because they were not only interesting,but informative and thought provoking with good old fashioned story telling and a hero we could root for. Go back to that formula. It felt like you had to prove every single thought.....you didn't, you had it right the first time when you wern't afraid of your critics.
014241039X|1.0|Who wants their child to read a book about a hateful couple who spend the entire duration of the book fighting back and forth?  I, for one, do not.  Knowing that Dahl divorced shortly after this book was written makes me wonder if this was possibly a reflection of his feelings at the time.
B001PO53IO|4.0|Love the show, blue ray really delivers with full HD.  The only beef I have is that I wish the episodes were much longer.  The ep are great to watch Its just that if the ep's were an longer then it would allow us to really lose ourselves to the show.  but overall the package is excellent and blue ray is a must.
B002LVVCIK|5.0|Moore is brilliant. I want the musical soundtrack to this film.  Ending it with a Woodie Guthrie song (after starting it with a rendition of \\"Louie Louie\\") was just polishing the gold of his brilliance.

B001MEJY8W|4.0|...not the faint of heart or mind.<br /><br />Not to give any plot points away, \\"Martyrs\\" is--succinctly--good.  It's one of those films that you watch with your hands cupped over your mouth, tears pouring down your face... At no time did I ever lean back in my seat with relief.  Not even at the end.  In fact, I started at the credits dumbly until they finished.<br /><br />It is a powerful film.  The narrative unfolds slowly and halfway through it one is left wondering where this could possibly be going and how on earth can it get any worse than it already has?  Then it does.  The main character is plunged into a situation that I will not delve deeper into to save those who may watch.  As a warning, you may only want to watch it once (as I did).  While the characters resonate deeply with me and I am invested in both of their stories, I don't think I can watch this happen again.  But I do recommend it for it's dramatic narrative.  As far as story-telling goes, \\"Martyrs\\" weaves one hell of a tale that leaves the viewer thinking about the outcome for hours after you have turned the DVD player off.<br /><br />As an avid horror film watcher, I am a poor gauge to measure how \\"gory\\" something is (after seeing so many I've gotten rather desensitized to the imagery and this, frankly, worries me).  I'll put it this way: emotionally, by the end of it all, I felt like curling into a dark corner and crying for a while (and I did end up bawling for a some time).  And yes, it is violent.  The images in the last twenty to fifteen minutes were hard for me to watch, but I was just too transfixed (in the \\"Oh God, Oh God, Oh God\\" sense of the word) to turn away.
B000LPLTX6|1.0|All i can say is this movie is boring and very disappointing.  Now i know why there wasn't a rent option.  Terrible.
B000IJ79WU|2.0|I'm rather glad I waited three years to watch the \\"Richard Donner Cut\\" of Superman II, as it's quite apparent it's not  equal to the theatrical version.  For one thing, the first half hour is incredibly slow......they inexplicably include footage from the climax of Superman: The Movie. This only confused and frustrated me. From there, the quality of this alternate cut varies.  While opening with the Daily Planet and Lois' foolish jump from the window, they miss an opportunity to feature Superman early in the film. We don't even see Supes until the Niagara Falls sequence, which for me is too long to go without the title character. Why do you think they have Batman appear in the 3rd scene of \\"The Dark Knight\\"? Because it's his movie, and we pay to see him kick butt.     Instead we get drawn out scenes of comic Luthor and his moron sidekick. While these scenes are amusing they add nothing to the story. Luthor's escape from the prison in a slow moving balloon was idiotic. Hey, prison guards! Shoot it down! Although I respect Gene Hackman as an actor, the choice to play Lex Luthor as a smarmy, smart alec and comic relief was always wrong (not to mention the bad toupees)  I actually appreciated seeing Brando's retored scenes. He brings so much gravitas and dignity to the film. I know some people don't think of this as a signature role of his, but he definitely elevates the whole endeavor. I also thought his sacrifice to restore his son's powers was well played.  I do have issues with how the Lois & Clark relationship plays out. Twice, she tried to trick him into revealing his alter ego, when you only needed to see that once. The original film's version of Lois leaping into the river at Niagara Falls is more effective.  I also prefer Clark's bumbling fall into the fire reveal, rather than the \\"gee, let me shoot Clark in the chest\\" version. Since that's obviously test footage, it's nowhere near as effective. Chris Reeves reaction in the original is powerful. Not so here......  The edited footage is very choppy.....and there are a few changes and leaps in logic that I can't abide. How is it that the villains can talk in outer space? Zod is floating space and he screams \\"FREEEE\\"? huh?  The final confrontation also was lacking. Superman confronts the villains and they....talk? Wow, how exciting. I know the saran wrap \\"S\\" weapon was goofy, but it was some action.  They also changed my absolute favorite line of the film: \\"General Zod, would you care to step outside?\\" is now, \\"Haven't you heard of freedom of the press\\"? What the....the former line reinforced his polite nature, ever in the face of danger. The ending was so protracted, it felt like I was watching \\"The Return of the King\\" again. And why does he destroy his Fortress of Solitude? What happened to Luthor? Did he leave the other villains to die?  I was warming to the idea of Lois knowing who Superman really is...and then they pull a really cowardly, dirty trick and have Superman reverse time....AGAIN!  What is the point of all that happened? If Superman can just reverse time whenever anything bad happens, where is the really drama or danger? How do people learn anything from the experience. A Complete and utter cop out.....totally unnecessary and negates all that came before. On top of that we still have Clark going back to the diner for some sweet revenge. In addition to being a huge plot hole, I don't think it's in character for Clark/Superman to seek such a petty revenge. He is Superman, and his abilities far outmatch any normal man. It just seems petty.........  Speaking of petty, Richard Donner's commentary is at times critical of his successor and he comes across as far too bitter. Don't you think 25 is enough time to get over something?  I would have been happy never seeing this version of SII; luckily it make me appreciate Lester's version all the more.
0061719544|5.0|i've been watching Craig on his Late Late show for awhile now & feel he's pretty good at what he does on-screen.  I couldn't wait for his latest book to come out & i must tell you IT'S A RIOT!  MUST READ!   I could not stop laughing on how he describes his life up to this point.  Some stories are sad, others YOU personally can relate to in your own life.  I pray that Mr. Ferguson has finally found peace, purpose & happiness here in The United States of America & wish his future  well.  (this guy is a royal hoot! :) )
B002L3RVCY|4.0|I distinctly remember seeing STAR WARS (sorry, kids, it's NOT called \\"A New Hope\\"!) in 1977 when I was 10 years old.  I've been a fan ever since. I was disappointed in the prequels, but loved the animated shorts on the Cartoon Network, so I had my hopes up for this series. The theatrical film was fairly bad - had it been released as part of the tv series, it would have been the weakest story arc of the season. But these episodes are GREAT! Good, old-fashioned, Star Wars fun: Good guys vs. bad guys, space battles, droids, lightsabers and blasters.     Only two things keep this from being a 5-star item: 1. The short length of the half-hour episodes sometimes makes them seem a bit rushed; and 2. Why is it that the female jedi (with one exception) have to run around in not much more than a bathing suit, while the male jedi are covered from head to toe in robes, armor, and gloves? It might be  nice if they brought a few female character and costume designers on-board to make things a little more equitable.    These, are minor quibbles, though.  All-in-all, my 9-year-old son and I love to watch this series together, and we hope that Lucas sees it through to at least 100 episodes, as he has said he'd like to do.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|Wikipedia tells us that the story of Robin Hood has been kicking around for centures. The name itself began kicking around in 1228, but people were probably telling stories about the character for a long time before that.    There's been many iterpretations of the Robin Hood story, including several on film which have varied from poor action adventures (Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves), to weird comedies (Robin Hood - Men in Tights), to an animated version (Disney's Robin Hood), that probably has most furries creaming their jeans.    But to me the best version of the story ever made was the 1938 Technicolor classic, The Adventures of Robin Hood. It has everything you could ever want in an adventure film: a sneering villain (Basil Rathbone), a beautiful heroine (Olivia de Havilland), a dashing hero (Errol Fylnn), great sword fights, wonderful dialogue, beautiful costumes, amazing sets, and an all around feeling of lighthearted joy and delight!    You know the story: Robin of Locksley goes out to stop the evil Prince John (Claude Rains), and his henchman, the Sherif of Notingham. Along the way he teams up with his Merry Men (including Little John, played by Alan Hale Jr, enters an archery contest, and wanders around with the kind of smirk Johnny Depp nearly managed to imitate in Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl.    There's several things that make this a great film. First, it's insanely entertaining! It's never slow or dull. It has brisk pacing that never lets up. The cinematography is well-done and fascinating to see, given that it was one of the first Technicolor epics (though you might go a little blind from the bright colors). The writting is sharp and clever. Even the music is everything you'd want from a movie like this! But the real gem here is the acting.    Consider the by-play between Robin and the Sheriff, or Robin and the Prince, or Robin and Maid Marion or, hell, Robin and a brick wall! Errol Flynn had this magical sort of charisma that forced you to pay attention to him every time he was on the screen and to be happy you were doing so. He brough a casual ease to his characters in movies like Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk. He's so important to The Adventures of Robin Hood that it's basically impossible to imagine the movie without him, how much more vapid and uninteresting it would've been with just about anyone else playing the lead. It's his swaggering, his smart-ass attitude and his talent with the sword that makes him the most memorable part of this film.    This isn't to take away from the rest of the cast. A hero is nothing without a great villain and you'd be hard-pressed to find one better than Basil Rathbone, with his sneer and his (frankly superior), fencing skills, he made a worth advesary for a hero like Flynn's Robin.    The movie is relentlessly fun, light-hearted and enjoyable. If you haven't yet seen it, you're doing yourself a great diservice. Watch it and see the swashbuckler genre done to a perfection that has hardly been seen since!

B000N4SHPS|4.0|this film is not without flaw . it gets so much so right though , it's not even about the fight . we all know the ROCKY films have not been RAGING BULL from the get go . the first film was a tremendously uplifting story about the spirit of an individual brawler who never would have prevailed giving and getting such superhuman punishment . if MR. TARVER'S character were to actually box MR. STALLONE'S character , it would last moments . it wouldn't even happen in exhibition . it's a mistake to observe this film as if it were an approximation of CINDERELLA MAN . you forgive the deep dark dye job if you understand that this film is about maturity . between the first film and this picture there were a lot of fun movies that were guilty pleasures more often than not . fun to watch over and over because of their implausibe and rote formula of good verses bad or proud or unfair . this rousing picture serves as a proper bookend to the first great chapter in a character saga . one in which we don't have to see the central character aged by make up but rather actual time itself . STALLONE'S maturity informs an individual so right and real that the only significant flaw is that he manages to go several rounds with the young boxer . by surrounding himself with an outstanding group of actors young and old . by putting so much truth into the lions share of what occurs on screen (in word and deed) . i feel he made the finest ROCKY picture yet . after its' fashion , nearly as satisfying and thrilling as MILLION DOLLAR BABY . great motion picture making . great entertainment . the coda that was needed .
B0021L8UXU|5.0|I'm always saying that I don't like comedy horrors - just straight supernatural horror for me, please - but then I see a movie like Drag Me to Hell or Zombieland and have to admit, \\"Okay, I like CERTAIN comedy horror flicks quite a bit.\\" Zombieland is an exceptionally funny movie from beginning to end, benefiting greatly from a clever and witty script, both in terms of visual humor and humorous dialogue. It is also a very gory and violent movie, a factor which has apparently been requisite in zombie movies ever since Romero's Living Dead; and so, in this sense, should satisfy that particular audience demographic as well. Woody Harrelson is perfect and utterly hill-air-ee-us as the tough as nails dispatcher of zombies, and the rest of the ensemble of four is also very likeable. The chemistry among the actors is excellent - enough so that I would pay to see a sequel with the same cast. A zombie movie with heart (and not just the ones being eaten).
B002IKLZZY|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock's \\"North By Northwest\\" MGM 1959 was way ahead of its time for film making pre 1960. Even though it scored zero oscars come trophy time, NBNW was and still is one entirely great watch on any occasion. I purchased the 50th anniversary edition film at Target for 15.99, came home and watched it and loved every minute of it. Hitch's play of the every man's sense of fear is played out in nearly every scene. The man knew what scared people and preyed upon them with celluloid. His techniques in this movie are masterful including the giant mattes that included Mt. Rushmore (after the national park service prohibited the film makers from having actors crawl on the president's faces) in Hollywood to the famous crop dusting scene that included one of the top film explosions of its day. There is action, suspense, drama, and a little love sprinkled in this master piece of a film. The 50 anniv. transfer is beautiful and should be enjoyed by everyone who loves great films.
1400034205|5.0|Published in 1944, this classic novel portrays the increasing awareness of existential choices in life faced by those who came of age in the 1920's, beginning to see the breadth of choices available in the 20th century, but seduced by the comfort of the traditions of the 19th century in an age of increased prosperity.  These questions were interrupted by the depression and WWII, but the existential challenges remain.  What life do you lead now that you are aware of the choices you make and their consequences?  A great book for a \\"know it all\\" college student, a mid-thirties adult or someone moving into their 50's.  There are no simple answers or guarantees, but actively making life choices seems to be part of the answer
B00009NHC5|5.0|I first saw this movie in its initial release back in 1967. I was gripped right from the beginning and held spellbound all through it. The final 15 minutes is when the big payoff comes and I remember everyone in the theater screaming for dear life! Truly a masterpiece in suspense and psychological thrills.     Here I am 42 years later and this movie has the same effect on me today as it did back then, and this comes after the blood and gore that producers rely on today to scare the bejesus out of us. Pretty poor attempt in my opinion.     Audrey was nominated for a well deserved Academy Award but, unfortunately, she lost to the other Miss Hepburn. Nonetheless, this movie has withstood the test of time and is well worth watching. Try watching it from Suzy's (Audreys Character) point of view, after the initial shock has worn off. It is a whole new experience in chills and thrills!!
B001FB4W0W|1.0|The main problem here is Anna Paquin - a terrible actress given not to interpreting a character but merely spewing memorized lines.  God, she is awful!!!!!!!  The secondary problem is that this show doesn't know what it is - sometimes it's a drama, sometimes a comedy - but never a black comedy - and sometimes it's just the bloody Waltons....Although admittedly, I don't know how the series ended...I couldn't watch it all.
B001GCUO16|5.0|What a terrific movie! And the Blue-Ray adds that extra touch to make it that much more like the movie theater!! Oh, and that Hugh Jackman..... Need I say more???
1573300403|4.0|TEASER - This is why I say that Michael can't do anything small. Just watch it and you'll see what I mean. He takes something as small as a music video DVD release and turns it 360 degress with this teaser into a whole lot more than that. Only Michael, folks, only Michael.<br /><br />BILLIE JEAN - Motown 25. Live. Michael Jackson and Billie Jean. They go together perfectly. And when you can see the wheels in Michael's head turning, you know that something special is about to happen -- and that's when the debut of the moonwalk -- very spontaneously -- happens. Very historic performance, very historic that I'm glad that they put on this DVD.<br /><br />BEAT IT - This is one of the video's that broke the color barrier on MTV, and it has very good reason to have done so. I love the plot of Michael breaking up a gang fight by using the power of dance -- only Michael could get by with this stuff, in all honesty.<br /><br />LIBERIAN GIRL - I love all of the celebrity guest appearances -- we even get a guest appearance from Bubbles! Everybody is looking around for Michael, and then he descends from the sky on a camera. So simple, yet very effective...and actually quite fun.<br /><br />SMOOTH CRIMINAL - This is one of Michael's most known songs, and one of the more beloved from the perfect Bad album. And this video is proof of why. It's the full moonwalker version, and it contains the ever famous anti-gravity lean. When I was younger, this video didn't make any sense to me, but now that I'm older and finally understand what I'm seeing, I can say that I really do appreciate and love this video.<br /><br />1995 MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS PERFORMANCE - Wow. Michael is DEFINITELY the greatest entertainer that ever lived. Songs include \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough,\\" \\"The Way You Make Me Feel,\\" \\"Jam,\\" \\"Scream,\\" \\"Beat It,\\" \\"Black Or White,\\" \\"Billie Jean, \\"Dangerous,\\" and \\"You Are Not Alone.\\" This is 15 minutes, 16 at most, and Michael simply does not stop. He proves here that he's the greatest entertainer in the world.<br /><br />THRILLER - You can't make a Michael Jackson video collection WITHOUT including this video. I'm sure it's been on all of them (except for Dangerous) in the past, and I'm sure that it'll be on all of them in the future. This is the ultimate music video, and, for that matter, it's the ultimate Michael Jackson video. So it HAS to be included here.<br /><br />Now we flip it to side two...<br /><br />SCREAM - The most expensive video at the time of it's making, featuring his sister Janet, Scream looks like technology come to life...especially for 1995 it looks like technology come to life. You can tell that Michael and Janet are having the time of their lives, too, which is always something good to see.<br /><br />CHILDHOOD - The theme from Free Willy 2, the video doesn't really do much for me. Quite possibly my least favorite video on the entire collection, but that's not saying that it's a bad video. It just, to me anyway, doesn't feel too much like a typical Michael Jackson video.<br /><br />YOU ARE NOT ALONE - I LOVE this video. This video just has to be seen to be believed. Trust me, for 1995, THIS is Michael at his absolute best!<br /><br />THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT US - Ah, this was so controversial. It actually had two video's made for it, but the one included on this disc is the publicly released video. It'd have been much more cool if they'd have included the banned video, but I love the song and I love the video, so I'm not going to complain too much.<br /><br />STRANGER IN MOSCOW - Remember what I said about \\"You Are Not Alone?\\" Now, take that down here, change the title to \\"Stranger In Moscow,\\" and you have my thoughts on this video.<br /><br />BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR - It's HIStory in the mix, ya know? I love this video. It just goes and goes and goes and goes -- and then, when you think it's done, it goes even more! Michael simply doesn't stop -- of course -- and the atmosphere of the video is completely awesome.One of my favorites on this set.<br /><br />BRACE YOURSELVES - Yep. You should always brace yourself when it comes to Michael Jackson, because you never know WHAT in the world is going to happen!mes to Michael Jackson, because you never know WHAT in the world is going to happen!

B002KDUDG6|4.0|I've never owned one of Michael Buble's CDs. I have to say it is amazing. I don't care for all the songs, I think a few could have been left of this album. I love his sound, he's such an \\"old soul\\". I love his covers of \\"Crazy Love\\",\\"Heartache Tonight\\" and \\"At This Moment\\". A lot of artists cover older songs, but fail to deliver. I feel Michael hit the nail on the head with this one. I recommend this album to anyone looking for some nice relaxing music, with a few upbeat songs.

B000002GC2|4.0|Quincy Jones's musical output from 1979-1981 is crazy. These Qunicy years brought great songs by Michael Jackson and The Brothers Johnson. His album here \\"The Dude\\" is no exception. \\"Have you met The Dude and his mistress Patti Austin\\"? She is probably the best part of this record, the only throw away to me is maybe \\"Just Once\\", \\"One Hundred Ways\\" is the better of the two ballads. \\"The Dude\\" is pretty damn funky, and the best of the whole bunch is \\"Somethin Special\\". Patti Austin is ethereal in this song, with great bass slapping by Louis Johnson. \\"Turn On The Action\\" has a very urgent feel to it, and \\"Ai No Corrida\\" is just fun. Go get it.

0142000671|5.0|I just finished reading this novel for school. It was such a heart warming story about George Milton and his mentally retarded companion Lennie. They begin working on a ranch that they desire to eventually buy and overcome many obstacles while working there. The ending of this novel was totally unexpected to me and I love when stories have a twist. The movie was just as great! I think I will read the Pearl next because it's in my closet and John Steinbeck has such an original writing style that makes me want to keep reading. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy classics. Everybody has to read this book some time in their life, so go out and get it!
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The Strokes are a unique band that has a very specific sound.  I was unsure whether that sound could carry through to another album and be just as entertaining.  After listening to this album I was pleasantly assured that the Strokes are here to stay.  It's not quite \\"Is This It?\\" but \\"Room on Fire\\" has enough good songs to tide me over.<br /><br />\\"What Ever Happened\\", \\"Reptilia\\", \\"Automatic Stop\\", \\"You Talk Way Too Much\\", \\"Between Love and Hate\\", and \\"Under Control\\" are the best songs on the cd.  These songs are hard to stop listening to and my ipod is tired of playing them.  The other songs don't stick at all, but you can't expect the cd to completely satisfy you.  I hope for at least 4 good songs, and I got a great good to bad song ratio on this cd.<br /><br />It's grungy, it's dirty, it's the lovely music of the Strokes you wanted more of.  If you can't get enough from their first album, consider this a direct sequel.  This cd doesn't go in a new direction.  It more of a continuation of the first round.  The great thing about \\"Room on Fire\\" is that the Strokes have the same style, but the music in no way gets old.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I rated this SOLELY based on it finally happening. I am really hoping they achieved gaining the rights to all the music involved with these episodes (the supposed reason why it has taken so long).  I am dying for the DVD but fear editing & replacement of music.  Cross your fingers fellow fans.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Has anyone noticed the audio is only DTS  not DTS HD MA as one was led to believe.  This blu ray audio is worse than both the   original 5.1 and the subsequent 6.1 from the  later release.
B0010ZR160|3.0|Due to the emotionally charged and physically graphic nature of this film you may think you know where it's going.  You do, but you won't expect how you get there.  What could have been a fairly compelling story about our apparent cultural dilemma on dealing with children whose parents refuse to manifests as a convoluted whodunnit.  The commentary on children maintaining no value in our culture should be valid enough material to compose a meaningful story.  It is thought-provoking but in theme only.  The plot meanders.  It's twists are not intuitive.  Although the acting is well done the emphasis on integrity of Bostonian accents results in an incredibly slurred performance by most of the main cast.  Through chewed words Affleck delivers an otherwise convincing Patrick Kenzie, though Monaghan never really established the relevance of Angie Gennaro.  Her performance underwhelmed and her character advanced the plot none.  If you want to see into the minds of those who hurt children and those who think they are protecting them from such, this film is interesting.  Keep it free and just watch the news.
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|I just bought this CD a few hours ago, and I'm actually listening to it right now as I write my review. The song playing now is 'Black Or White' Some of the songs are really good. Michael Jackson really was a good singer! Some of my favorites are They Don't Care About Us, Shake Your Body Down to the Ground, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Thriller, Beat It, and Billie Jean. If you are a fan of Michael Jackson, you gotta buy the CD because THIS IS IT!!!

B00004YX39|5.0|I feel almost silly and kind of lame-o for writing a review for this album. Why should this album need another great review? But somehow, I feel compelled to add my two cents. I am a Steely Dan geek, a fanatic! This is why I can't understand how anyone who is even remotely familiar with this superb band can give this album anything less than the coveted 5-star amazon review. This is not only Steely Dan at their absolute pinnacle, it is one of the greatest works of art of all time. I have to quote another reviewer who summed up my feelings best.........    \\"Gaucho is filled with songs surrounding the seamy underside of society's high rollers. It reveals a world seen through the haze of drugs and despair. It's a cathartic aural experience. If you haven't heard this album, you haven't experienced the full potential of music and the human imagination.\\"         Damn, I wish I had written that! But this is the most perfect summation of this brilliant album. The main thing I would draw attention to is the absolute beauty and tranquility that this album evokes. It's a desperate and romantic tranquility, that seeps in while you are listening and won't let go. It goes without saying that, being a Steely Dan album, the playing and production are perfect; beyond that,  this album exudes an aura of desperate, cool, and sublime peace. Comparing this album to Aja, or to any other Steely Dan album is so silly, and futile. I won't get into the whole \\"song structure\\" BS.  Again, being a Steely Dan album, the quality of the songs is taken for granted.         You see, this is why I didn't want to write a review. This review sucks because I can't write a review that will adequately do justice to this superb, mind blowing cd.
1592802788|1.0|Marty Schwartz doesn't answer any questions and this is not an interview as represented. It is just some guy reading stuff from Marty's book The Pit Bull which I highly rate and would recommend to anyone. This is a total waste of money and a ripoff - nothing new here.
B001PJ3S3G|1.0|I am not going to go  track by track to waste anyones time describing what I thought (think) about The Empyrean other than to give one piece of advice - Do not waste your money on this!!!    This comes from a person who is a big fan of \\"stripped  down\\" music that does not sound like a polish turd due to the technology of Pro Tools.    I love music that sounds authentic and not adjusted.    I have tried to get into John's music time and time again, however it just sounds like a bunch of kids from Pittsburgh trying to write and record on a Tascam 4 track from 1989.    The album should also come with a suicide warning; or for that matter, razorblades.    If there was some type of money back guarantee, I would be first in line.

0439023483|5.0|I heard a review of Hunger Games on NPR a few weeks ago and bought it to read with my daughters (9 and 11) at bedtime.  They are captivated and want me to read it to the end every night.    My wife and I pre-read both books and decided they are two-read books.  The first read, you gobble up the plot voraciously.  Then you want to read it again to savor the elements that you skimmed over the first time.  This was like reading the Harry Potter series for me.    Excellent book.  There is a lot of violence, but it is crafted well as a critique on violence rather than glorification. Excellent girl-power, pre-teen/early teen book that can be enjoyed by adults.
0765348276|1.0|The book starts out well, lots of wit in the first dozen pages.  But the dialog becomes lame, pointless and obvious.  If you've read Asimov, Heinlein and Vinge then the science will seem simplistic and tenuous.  If you've read Orson Scott Card then you will find the moral lessons simplistic.    I had to skim the final 100 pages.  I'm surprised this is so highly rated.

B00133KFGW|4.0|Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) attended Julia Music Performing Arts School in New York and played the cello. Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) was the member of a rock band. There was a connection between them the second they met and on that day a musical genius was conceived. The day she gave birth, Lyla's father made a choice that he claimed was for both of them, but it was really a selfish decision. Lyla no longer had her son and she was separated from Louis.<br />Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) listened to sounds of the wind, city streets, etc and he would hear music. He was in a home for boys where his gift was not appeciated because they saw him as freakishly different. He wanted to be with his birth parents, not placed in someone's home. He had no anger because they gave him up, but was consumed with thoughts of where they could possibly be and he kept believing he could follow the music that would lead him to them.<br />I enjoyed August Rush. Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams)bothered me a bit, though. He acted like he cared about Evan but he didn't really want this boy to be happy. He deceived him and tried to fill his mind with doubt. Wizard's thinking was all messed up because he was scarred by the foster care system. He lived in an abandoned theater with homeless children he was supposedly taking care of but he was really using them. It was a good thing Richard Jeffries (Terrance Howard) cared about what happened to Evan.<br />There's a scene where a choir is practicing a beautiful song and the ending touched my heart. This is a movie for the entire family.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have many DVD's for working out, most of them drive me nuts with overly happy people and LONG workouts with too many variations of moves that could be simpler.  No time to get to the gym...20 minutes is all I need now!  This DVD workout seriously changes your body.  I use it probably 5 times a week and in just over a month I have seen BIG changes in my arms,. legs and mid section.  And all in 20 minutes a work out!  Amazing!  I love that it has multiple levels as you get stronger...but even the level one is so awesome you could do it for months and still see changes!  Highly recommend.
B002AGIEYG|5.0|Simon Rattle conducting Brahms? I never would have thought that this set would be worth acquiring, especially considering that I already own what I consider to be the best Brahms symphony cycles: Solti, Harnoncourt, Dohnanyi, Abbado, Bohm, and Karajan, then I started reading all of the glowing reviews on Amazon and other websites that said this cycle is one of the best ever recorded. Is that a fair assessment calling the Rattle Brahms set one of the best ever? Compared to all of the other sets I've heard: yes, it is.<br /><br />The other reviewers certainly wrote great enthusiastic reviews (and quite detailed ones at that), so all I can do is really second their enthusiasm for this current cycle. It seems that Rattle brings out some of the darker elements in Brahms' music. In lesser hands, you have a conductor on the podium who tries to be too classically-oriented with this music. Brahms was a bleeding heart Romantic and in my opinion should be played that way. Another thing that was great was Rattle brought out more textures from the woodwinds, especially in the finale of \\"Symphony No. 2,\\" which I haven't heard so clearly defined on any other set. Rattle gives all symphonies much clearer-headed readings where every note is considered, but this is Rattle's approach in general. He's a detail-oriented conductor much like Boulez in the sense that he lays the structure of the music right out in front you in a very accessible way.<br /><br />The Berliners play fantastic too. I've never heard them sound so energized and passionate or at least not recently. All of these recordings were recorded live and the audio quality is fantastic. All sections of the orchestra never sounded better. Perhaps Rattle's Brahms is the work of someone who genuinely likes Brahms. Rattle has had some failures in the past with Haydn, Berlioz, Dvorak, Beethoven, and Schubert to name a few, but his Brahms is truly a spectacle to behold. Highly recommended.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|In this fine suspense/psychological horror film, an affluent couple in Connecticut decides to adopt a new child (she already has two children, one deaf, and has just lose her third in a miscarriage) and settles in an orphanage for a seemingly charming and very precocious nine year old Russian girl named Esther. Soon, though, the new member of the family shows a maturity well beyond her years and starts making terrible mischief with an escalating maliciousness that knows no boundaries, manipulating every member of the family to turn against each other and soon involving herself in real (as opposed to merely psychological) violence. Her adopted mother starts to suspect a terrible secret lies behind her. Eventually, things will escalate to murder. Well filmed (though there are too many false suspense moments) and especially well scripted, this movie has a final twist that I will not discuss here as not to spoil it to future viewers, but let me say that it is very nifty, it makes a lot of sense of what we just see before and puts this movie well above other run of the mill demon child stories. 12 year old's Isabelle Fuhmann performance as Esther is just mind blowing. Vera Farmiga, as the troubled mother seeing with impotence how this girl from hell is breaking her family is also fine.

B000002U8G|5.0|The opening instrumental track on this album, called \\"One of These Days\\" was one of those kind of songs that made me worship the DJ's of WRIF FM Detriot back when I was 13.  I then noticed that \\"Fearless\\" was also playing on the radio pretty regularly, which was cool, but when I bought this album and played the track \\"Echoes\\", I was blown away!  My taste in music pretty much changed over night.<br /><br />Back in Detroit, in the late fall of 1974; I was still listening to AM radio.  Of course, every Saturday, I tuned in to the Casey Kasem American Top Forty.  Disco was just beginning and some of the silliest songs started to become the most popular songs.  So, my aunt introduced me to an FM rock station, and I started to hear music with more depth and intensity.  I started to listen to Robin Trower, Led Zeppelin, Alice Cooper, Queen, Aerosmith, and the such.<br /><br />But then, I started hearing those FM rock stations playing older, more unusual expressions of rock.  I paid more attention to the instrumentation of the music, and in turn, I discovered Progressive Rock.  In one day, I discovered King Crimson's \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", then \\"And You and I\\" by Yes, and then the title track from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer's \\"Trilogy.\\"  That was it!  I never played AM radio again.  In fact, I began to hate the songs that I thought I loved earlier.  Nevermore.  I was on a new path for what music meant to me.  I never played my 45's ever again (well, not for quite a long time anyway).  My first stereo that I bought was an 8-track tape stereo, with a turntable on top.  I started buying 8-track tapes for rock albums, but I definitely bought vinyl LP's for my favorite Progressive Rock albums.  I started buying all the available Pink Floyd albums, and when \\"Wish You Were Here\\" came out in 1975, I never listened to AM radio ever again.<br /><br />Here it is, nearly 2010, and I'm still loving music from nearly 40 years ago, that sounds more futuristic and advanced than music has sounded for the past 20 years.  Progressive Rock is magical, mystical, and optimistically psychological.for the past 20 years.  Progressive Rock is magical, mystical, and optimistically psychological.
